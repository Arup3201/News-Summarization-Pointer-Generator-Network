Russian diplomats say the unnamed 17-year-old was 'seduced' by a homosexual couple in a church (file picture)

An Russian high school student has found himself at the centre of diplomatic storm after he was adopted by a same-sex couple while on an exchange programme to the U.S.

It is thought that the unnamed 17-year-old sought asylum in America because he is gay, following a surge in homosexual Russians migrating to the U.S. because of strict 'propaganda' laws legislated by Moscow in 2013. 

But the Russian government claims the boy was 'illegally' put up for adoption, and that he was 'seduced' by an older gay couple that he met at church. 

The mother of the boy travelled to Michigan, where he was studying, earlier this year in an apparent attempt to persuade him to come home. 

Lisa Coate, vice president of the organisation that runs the exchange programme, said the U.S. 'funded [the mother's] trip to allow her to speak to her son and tell him whatever she wanted to tell him', but the boy decided to stay put.

The state-run Tass news agency said Russian diplomats had visited the boy, and found that the 17-year-old was 'seduced' by 'a pair of old homosexuals at church, former military men who had already adopted two American boys, and they offered to become his sponsor and even pay for his studies at Harvard University'.

It was at this point that the boy handed himself over to immigration authorities, seeking asylum.

The student had been due to return to Russia in the Spring of this year, but the country's authorities only made the case public this week. 

Russia's children's commissioner Pavel Astakhov said: 'A child, who has a mother in Russia, has illegally been placed under guardianship, and the boy has been handed over to a U.S. gay couple.

'The child hails from a decent family and is healthy so it's unclear what arguments those in the United States have been guided by.'

The boy's attorney, Susan Reed, of the Michigan Immigrants Rights Center, told BuzzFeed that the Russian authorities were 'completely mischaracterising' what had happened, but gave no further details. 

Russia's children's commissioner Pavel Astakhov said it was unclear why the U.S. granted asylum to the boy as he 'hails from a decent family and is healthy'

U.S. Ambassador to Moscow John F. Tefft said he regretted the Russian Government's decision to cancel the exchange programme (file picture)

The spat has led to Russia cancelling the long-standing pupil exchange programme amid wider tensions between the two nations.

The Future Leaders Exchange Program (FLEX) sponsored high school students from former Soviet countries to come to the U.S. to study.

At least 15 Russian students have refused to return home since the programme's inception in 1993.

Konstantin Dolgov, from the Kremlin's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said: 'An unacceptable situation emerged as a result, when our [Russian] school students were in fact subjected to the legislature of American states, where minors were able to choose on their own and without their parents’ permission their place for living or being adopted'.

U.S. Ambassador John F. Tefft responded in a statement via the Moscow embassy’s website. It read: 'We deeply regret this decision by the Russian government to end a programme that for 21 years has built deep and strong connections between the people of Russia and the United States.' 

Since the so-called 'homosexual propoganda' law came into effect in Russia in 2013, there has been a surge in citizens seeking asylum in countries with more equal rights for gay people, including the U.S..

The two countries were at loggerheads in 2012 after U.S. barred entry to all suspected human rights abusers, leading Russia to ban all adoptions of Russian children by Americans, as well as any other nations that allow gay marriages.
