Jessie Burton, writer and actress

An impoverished actress is  set to become a millionaire after  her debut novel soared to the top  of the book charts - outselling  J. K. Rowling.

Jessie Burton, 31, landed a six-figure book deal after her novel  - The Miniaturist - became the subject of a frantic bidding war.

It was eventually published by Picador and sold to 30 countries and is now being fought over by film producers who think it has the makings of a blockbuster.

The novel is the story of an arranged marriage in 17th Century Amsterdam and revolves around a miniature doll's house that the heroine was given as a wedding gift from her husband.

It entered the Booksellers' charts at number four and is currently outselling Robert Galbraith (aka) J. K. Rowling  at Waterstone's.

The last first novel to be so successful was EL James's bonkbuster Fifty Shades Of Grey, which currently holds the crown for fastest-selling debut. But E. L. James's book was published straight to the cheaper paperback format - not hardback - after her work had already become an online hit, boosting initial sales.

Waterstone's head buyer Kate Skipper said of The Miniaturist: 'It's so rare for a debut to sell in this way but it is simply a fantastic novel and the must-read book of the summer.'

Until her breakthrough, Jessie was an out-of-work actress. Now she has bought her first home, a £270,000 one-bedroom flat in Forest Hill, South-East London, with her boyfriend, actor Pip Carter.Jessie, an only child, dedicated  the novel to Pip and parents, Edward, 71, a retired architect turned antique, ceramic and porcelain restorer, and Linda, 70, a retired schoolteacher.

Jessie was educated at the non-fee paying Church of England Lady Margaret School in Fulham and her first love was acting.But after a year at Central School of Speech and Drama, she realised that she would not be able to earn a living as an actress and began writing her novel.

She conceived the idea of The Miniaturist in 2009 after a weekend break with Pip to Amsterdam.

'We both love going to museums - it 
sounds so nerdy - but we do have a mutual interest in art and culture 
and stuffing our faces,' she said.

'Pip suggested we went to the 
Rijksmuseum and I saw the doll's house. It's a beautiful object and I 
was completely mesmerised. When I discovered that it cost the same as a 
real town house to build and furnish, I was hooked.'

Two
 years later, after winning a place on a creative writing course, she 
finished the manuscript, returning to Amsterdam on her 30th birthday in 
2012 to add the final touches to The Miniaturist.

Mushens put the book up to auction with 11 publishers and landed Jessie her life-changing deal.'I was working in an office in the City,' Jessie recalled of the day publishers began fighting for her signature to take the book.

It was a Friday afternoon and my agent left me a voicemail with the list of 11 publishers.

It was just crazy. 'By Monday, two had dropped out but we still had nine publishers, some making enormous leaps to stay in the auction. I could barely concentrate.'

Since then, her life has been a whirlwind. She and Pip bought their flat in March - she previously couldn't get a mortgage - and she had a book launch at the Rijksmuseum and at the London Canal Museum.

She has also received a letter from Booker Prize winner Hilary Mantel congratulating her on the book.

Jessie, who leaves for a tour of America in September, is now working on her next novel - which is set in 1937 Spain and 1967 London.
