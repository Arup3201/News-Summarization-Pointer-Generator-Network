Passengers were evacuated from two Delta Air Lines planes at New York's John F Kennedy Airport on Monday night after an anonymous caller reported a bomb on board one of the airline's aircraft.

Police and bomb-sniffing dogs surrounded the planes after the caller told Delta's headquarters that a pipe bomb was planted on Flight 468 - a number used by two of the airline's planes that day.

More than 200 passengers who were in the middle of boarding a flight to Tel Aviv, Israel, were led off the plane and onto buses, before the aircraft was removed to a remote area and searched.

Meanwhile, 171 passengers on a flight that had just landed from San Francisco were also swiftly removed from their aircraft. They were told to walk to buses while the plane was investigated.

Passengers' luggage, including their carryons, was then subjected to a K-9 search. Following this, it was put back through the airport's screening machines, before being returned to its owners.

Airport authorities later said no explosives were found on board either plane, according to NBC. In a Twitter post, the FBI also confirmed: 'All clear at JFK airport following earlier bomb threat.'

Delta Air Lines officials said that 'proper security procedures' were being followed for both flights. 

Following the bomb report at around 8.15pm, emergency crews swarmed the San Franscisco Boeing 757, which had landed at 7.58pm, and the outbound 777, due to depart at 9.23pm.

On Monday night, passengers on both planes were taking to social media to describe what was happening. Some reported the presence of up to 30 emergency vehicles on the tarmac.

Shortly before 9pm, passenger Richie Greenberg tweeted: ' We're all being held safely on heated buses away from the plane. Port authority police came aboard bus, was a bomb threat #delta468.'

Walking to the buses: Airport authorities later said no explosives were found on board the departing plane. However, the arriving California plane is still being swept by officials. Above, passengers on the tarmac

Richie Greenberg, who was on one of the two planes, tweeted: 'Someone called in a threat to this plane'

He later revealed he and his fellow passengers had been allowed back into the airport, but said: 'Having to wait for all carryons left onboard, to be scanned and brought to us in terminal #delta468.'

Meanwhile, a passenger named Andrea tweeted: 'So much for getting in early! Bomb scare on delta flight at JFK.' The tweet was accompanied by a photo of police vehicles and fire crews at the scene.

Passengers will now be interviewed by detectives before they can leave the airport, officials said.

Port Authority spokesman Joe Pentangelo said the telephone threat was made while the plane flying from San Francisco was still in the air. He added there have been no injuries or arrests.

It comes just two days after anxious passengers were forced to disembark a Delta  plane on the tarmac at a North Carolina airport after another bomb threat was made - this time, via Twitter.

Law enforcement officers surrounded the twin-engine McDonnell Douglas MD-90 aircraft after it landed at Raleigh-Durham International Airport from Atlanta.

Nearly 110 passengers were held for nearly three hours while the plane and its luggage were inspected, and everyone on board was checked by police dogs. The FBI is investigating.  

In a statement to 11 Alive about the latest evacuations, Delta said: 'Earlier this evening, another airline received a threat regarding Delta flight 468.

Airport: In a statement on Monday evening, Delta said: 'Proper security procedures are being followed for both aircraft'. Above, John F Kennedy Airport, where the incident involved shortly after 8pm on Monday

Several hours after the drama began, the FBI tweeted: 'All clear at JFK airport following earlier bomb threat'

'Delta currently operates two aircraft under that specific flight number. San Francisco to New York-JFK, which is currently on the ground at New York-JFK, and New York-JFK to Tel Aviv, currently in the boarding process. Proper security procedures are being followed for both aircraft. Delta has passed this information on to federal authorities.'
