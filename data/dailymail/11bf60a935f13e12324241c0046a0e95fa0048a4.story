Katie Price is preparing to give birth to her fourth child earlier than expected after suffering complications during her pregnancy.

The model, 35, has spent the past two weeks on bed rest after being rushed to hospital while on holiday on the continent.

The mother-of-three is only 32 weeks along, so doctors have warned her she is likely to give birth early via Caesarean section.

Speaking about her drama, Katie told The Sun: 'My
baby was in danger, but between the medical staff here and my doctor in
London, I am in good hands and have to believe all will be well.'

Katie had been told the amniotic sac - a bag of fluid inside the womb - had torn, meaning her waters had broken early and her unborn child was at risk of becoming infected by the transfer of the bacteria.

However, doctors believe the baby will be fine, although it is expected to arrive earlier than expected.

Katie added: 'I just want my baby out so I can meet it and hold it in my arms. I will feel much safer knowing it is in an incubator.

Difficult pregnancy: The model said her fourth pregnancy has been the most difficult

'Doctors have told me they want to keep the baby inside me for as long as possible, but they've told me they want to perform a Caesarean.'

The baby drama began after the star travelled for 27 hours in her horsebox following a mix-up over her children's passports.

Katie was forced to cancel her booking at a Spanish villa after her ex-husband Peter Andre and his girlfriend Emily MacDonagh - who are expecting their first child together - 'forgot' to send over passports for son Junior, eight, and daughter Princess, six, making them 'abandon' their plans.

Not wanting to let her children down, Katie explained she decided to wait for their passports and then travel around Europe in her horsebox - meaning they had been on the road for a staggering 27 hours by the time they reached their destination.

While her husband Kieran Hayler has remained by her side during Katie's stay, her brother Daniel flew to visit her on Thursday and to bring her children Princess and Junior back to the UK so they could go on holiday with their father Peter to Australia.

After spending the last fortnight holed up in the European hospital, Katie explained while the staff are 'great', she feels like she is 'in prison' and is hoping she won't have to stay at the facility for too much longer.

Tough time: Katie had a much better pregnancy with son Junior, from her former marriage to Peter Andre

The model has made no secret of the fact her current pregnancy has been her most difficult yet and she has gained more weight than when she carried her previous children.

She wrote in her Sun column recently: 'I haven't got long to go now. I've got a date and I know the sex but no one knows yet - and this time I'm huge.

'I'm the biggest I've been for all of my pregnancies. I'm 11st already, whereas I was not even ten-and-a-half full-term with the others.'

As well as weight gain, Katie has also been very uncomfortable, suffering from anaemia and low platelets.

Katie and Kieran wed in front of just a few people in the Bahamas on January 16 after getting engaged after Christmas - just two months after she ended her 20 month on/off romance with Argentine model Leandro Penna.

In February, Katie announced she was pregnant with her fourth child.

Her surprise pregnancy comes after failed IVF attempts to start a family with Leandro and second ex-husband Alex Reid.

She started dating Alex just a few months after splitting from first husband Peter Andre, but left him in January 2011 after 11 months of marriage.

She also had a 20 month on/off romance and subsequent engagement with Leandro, but they never made it down the aisle.

Katie's representative confirmed to the MailOnline that the model and baby 'are stable at the moment'.
