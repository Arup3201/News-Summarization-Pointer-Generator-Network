With its thatched cottages, Saxon heritage and proud farming roots Silverton in Devon's beautiful Exe valley is the quintessential English village.

But residents say an Asbo 'Section 30 Dispersal Order' - more commonly used in inner cities - has smeared their image to help police tackle a minority of troublemakers.Â 

They have complained that the move will damage their formidable reputation - and send property prices tumbling.

Dispersal order: Residents of Silverton say a Asbo 'Section 30 Dispersal Order' - more commonly used in inner cities - has smeared their image

Not since the Saxons first invaded has there been such outrage in 
the parish at the imposition of new rules.

An influx of problem families into the village with a population of 1,905 has been blamed for a rise in anti-social behaviour.

Latest crime figures show the number 
of 'nuisance' incidents in Silverton more than trebled - from nine to 33
per year - between 2010 and the end of 2011.

This is set against an overall 14 per 
cent reduction in anti-social behaviour across Mid Devon Council's area 
over a similar period.

Police and council officials say the 
Asbo will help tackle intimidation of residents, criminal damage and the
pelting of houses with objects.

Jane Isaac, 53, landlady of the Lamb 
Inn, where 80 villagers packed a public meeting, said an influx of 
'problem' families had damaged their reputation.

'We're being used as a dumping ground 
for a couple of problem families who keep getting moved around council 
properties,' she said.

'The idea is that they are dispersed throughout the council area to dilute the effect they have.

'But these families' kids just end up dragging local kids into trouble.'

Her husband Alan, 56, said: 'Most Silverton people think the dispersal zone is over the top.'

Officers will have the power to order 
any group of two or more people 'causing, or likely to cause, 
anti-social behaviour' to leave a dispersal zone - marked on village 
maps stuck to lamp posts.

Under 16s can be escorted back to 
their homes while parents may receive warning letters and 'acceptable 
behaviour' contracts for their children.

Amanda Parker, 40, manager of the village's Spar store, said: 'Most customers are really angry about the dispersal order.

'It damages the reputation of the village and people feel it is going to hit property prices.'

Hairdresser Anita Petherick, who opened the Silverton Barber Shop three months ago, said: 'Friends have asked me; "why open a shop there - that's the Asbo village."

'Neighbouring areas are getting the impression that this is a really bad place.

'But that's nonsense. I haven't heard one customer complain to me about anti-social behaviour.'

The Rev Alan McDonald, vicar of Silverton's 15th century Grade I listed Church of St Mary the Virgin, said the order, obtained by the East and Mid Devon Community Safety Partneship, was disproportionate.

'Until this order was publicised most people in the village were unaware there was even a problem,' he said.

The authority's community safety officer, Julia Ryder, said the new police powers would target a 'small number of individuals who are responsible for the behaviour, or who are encouraging others to get involved.'

Sergeant Paul Roberts, of Devon and Cornwall Police, said the order would not affect anyone 'wishing to meet and go about normal day to day activities.'

However many villagers remain unimpressed. Retired Royal Navy warrant officer John Jackson, 69, moved to Silverton last year from Plymouth.

'You see kids riding around on BMX bikes, wearing hoodies and making a noise,' he said. 'Some of them probably have a few cans of lager.

'But that doesn't make Silverton a troublespot. If you think otherwise, try living where I was in Plymouth.'
