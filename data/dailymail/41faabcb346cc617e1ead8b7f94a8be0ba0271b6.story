George Zimmerman stayed at the home of a close friend who is a former police officer for six weeks during the height of the public outcry over the Trayvon Martin shooting.

The Miami Herald revealed while the world was looking for Zimmerman in the wake of the shooting in Sanford, Florida, he was hiding out in his friend Mark Osterman’s house in the neighboring town of Lake Mary.

This news comes the same day as Zimmerman requested to have the judge in his case be replaced because he does not think he will get a fair trial because circuit judge Kenneth Lester Jr.  thinks Zimmerman ‘flaunted the system’ by failing to disclose his true financial holdings. 

Though Mr Osterman’s name was blurred out of court documents that were released publicly Thursday, The Herald used the personal stories mentioned during his police interview about the Martin shooting to determine his identity.

Mr Osterman said that he has known Zimmerman since 2006, when his wife Sondra worked with Zimmerman. The couple became close friends with Zimmerman and his wife Shellie, so much so that Mrs Osterman presided over the Zimmerman’s wedding.

During the interview, Mr Osterman, 44, described a seemingly close relationship with Zimmerman, saying that the two men would frequently go over to one another’s houses, take hunting trips, and go on monthly visits to the nearby Gander Mountain shooting range.

Mr Osterman also claimed that he was the one to teach Zimmerman how to shoot.

Though Mr Osterman, an Army veteran, met some of Zimmerman’s friends by hosting a graduation party for Zimmerman after he finished Seminole State College, he told FBI and Florida Department of Law Enforcement officials that he believes himself to be his one close friend.

‘Zimmerman stays in casual contact with a lot of people, but is not known to have any other close friends,’ Mr Osterman told investigators.

They seem to be extremely close, as Mr Osterman went to the scene of the Trayvon Martin shooting on the night of February 26 when the shooting happened, has accompanied Zimmerman to all of his interrogations, and was with Zimmerman when he did a video-taped walk-through of the crime scene for police.

He apparently did so even though he is not Mr Zimmerman’s legal representation and has close ties to the local police departments since he used to work in the county sheriff’s department.

‘During his conversations with Zimmerman, Zimmerman never asked… what not to say during his interviews with the police,’ the police report states.

‘(Mr Osterman) stated Zimmerman did not understand the process and his only advice to Zimmerman was to tell the truth.

‘He described Zimmerman as a person of strong character, but not very street wise.

‘He has never known Zimmerman to be in a fist fight.’

A number of the interviews released by the FBI and the FDLE show that hundreds of acquaintances and family friends were asked if they thought Zimmerman was racist, and Mr Osterman’s interview only briefly touched on the issue.

Support: Osterman accompanied Zimmerman to every police interrogation about the Martin shooting

At the time of the interview, Zimmerman was hiding out at Mr Osterman’s house, and Mr Osterman told interviewers that ‘Zimmerman is frustrated with the new Black Panther party and is very scared of them.’

‘Zimmerman is very concerned with all the negative reaction from the press and others and wants more evidence released to show what really happened.’

Mr Osterman’s dubious employment history is also included in the notes. During his time as a deputy at the Seminole County sheriff's office, he was pressured to quit after he and another officer were fooled into working as security guards for a con man.

The man, named Juan Diaz, approached Mr Osterman and another officer saying he was a second baseman for the New York Yankees and asked them to work as his body guard while going to strip clubs and bars in Florida.

Mr Osterman resigned in 1998 after an administrative panel suggest he be fired because they did not get the bureaucratic approval to work an off-duty security shift.

Since 2001, he has worked for the Department of Homeland Security as an air marshal, and on Facebook he describes his job as involving ‘lots of shooting and traveling’.

Other interviewees said that they thought the neighbourhood watchman was ‘a soft guy’ who had a ‘little hero complex’ but did not believe he was racist even after he fatally shot unarmed teenager Travyon Martin.

The investigators heard a number of different accounts from Zimmerman’s friends, including one who said the shooter told him that Martin mounted him and tried reaching for his gun while saying ‘You’re gonna die now mother*****!’
