Ross Barkley thinks one thing protected him from too many comparisons with Wayne Rooney as he first started to progress through the Everton youth ranks: he played in central defence.

‘My ambition was always to be a ball-playing centre half, like Rio Ferdinand,’ said Barkley, the 20-year-old Liverpudlian seen as one of the long-term successors to Rooney’s England No 10 shirt.

‘Rooney came through as a striker. I came through as a midfielder, but when I was younger, I was a defender and I enjoyed it. I played there until Under 14s. So, I was never really compared to Rooney.

‘At the moment, I see myself as a No 10. Because I’m young, I’ll play anywhere but in the future, hopefully in the middle of the park.’

It was Neil Dewsnip — an academy coach at Everton until he left last year to become the FA’s technical lead for the U17-21 age groups — who decided it was time for Barkley to step forward into midfield.

‘I was playing up an age and I was told, “You’re in centre-mid today, just enjoy it”,’ said Barkley. ‘I think it was because I was constantly running out with the ball from the back. Sometimes I’d make a few mistakes on the edge of the box and the strikers would score. I had to simplify things.’

It chimes with his experience in Miami before the World Cup in Brazil, when he produced a terrific performance in a friendly against Ecuador, only for Roy Hodgson to criticise him for losing possession in dangerous areas.

‘Obviously, I’m the type of player who takes risks, so now and then I’m going to give the ball away,’ said Barkley. ‘I just have to learn not to give it away in silly areas of the pitch.

‘I learned a lot at the World Cup, from being around the likes of Steven Gerrard and Frank Lampard. That it’s not a kids’ game any more. A year or two ago, I was playing reserve-team football. It’s a big step. I’ve still got a lot to learn.

‘From a personal point of view, it (playing in a World Cup) was a good experience. I always grew up hoping to play in a World Cup for England — and I did and hopefully there will be more in the future as well. To lift a trophy for England is what every player wants to do.’

Last year was a breakthrough for Barkley, initially making Everton’s first team, and then selection for England and earning a place in Hodgson’s 23-man squad for Brazil, where he played a part in all three games. 

The last 12 months have brought reward and relief after the serious injury in October 2010 which set his development back years.

Barkley broke a leg in three places in a freak collision with team-mate Andre Wisdom during an England Under 19 game in Belgium in 2010. The Belgian doctor who first treated the injury feared the teenager might not play again.

‘I came back and did well initially and made my Everton debut but after that I struggled for a bit, just getting my confidence back and my leg in tackling-wise,’ said Barkley.

David Moyes, then Everton boss, visited to offer personal encouragement and support, and as he recovered Everton purposely selected tough loan moves to Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds, so he would experience the pressure of performing in front of big crowds, although he played only four times for Leeds.

‘He did help out a lot,’ said Barkley of Moyes. ‘I was at home after my operation and he came around to my house, which he didn’t need to, to speak to my mum and reassure me that everything was going to be OK.

‘I went out on loan and it was like going from being a kid to manning up; going into a man’s game and getting games every week. At Leeds I was working really hard . . . when I came back I got on at Everton. Things started to change as I was getting on the pitch more. I started against Arsenal and Tottenham.’ 

England boss Roy Hodgson gave Barkley playing time in each of England's World Cup group games

Barkley admits that winning a trophy with England in the future would be 'a dream come true'

Those starts came in April 2013. Five months later, at the age of 19, he made his England debut, in a 4-0 win against Moldova at Wembley. A pre-season knee injury has prevented him adding to his caps since the World Cup but as Rooney prepares for his 100th international appearance, against Slovenia tomorrow, Barkley hopes for his 10th.

Still, he is not 21 yet, and young enough that his first memory of watching England came this century: David Beckham’s free-kick against Greece in 2001. ‘I was celebrating on the couch,’ he said. ‘At that moment, I really wanted to play for England.’

These days, he can barely move for flattering comparisons. Hodgson likened him to Paul Gascoigne, whom Barkley never saw play. ‘I was only, like, three, when he was playing at Everton but I’ve seen clips on YouTube,’ he said. ‘Everyone knows how talented he was.’

And then, of course, there’s Rooney. He may have escaped comparisons in his schoolboy days, but there are similarities: Scousers, Evertonians, identified for great things at an early age, with pace and power to accompany their raw talent and imagination.

‘Wayne has helped me a lot since I came into the squad,’ said Barkley. ‘He’s been giving me advice about getting in the box when the wingers have the ball — not on the edge of the box but in the box — and that with my movement I will get loads of goals that way.

‘There are still loads of pictures of Wayne at the Everton academy . . . he said he coped with it all easily, that it just came naturally. That’s the way I look at it. I don’t want to get big-headed. I don’t feel pressure. I don’t see there’s much expectation on me. Maybe in the future.

‘I think, because I’m young, every time I get on the pitch, I just enjoy playing football. I’m not scared when I’m on the pitch. I don’t see anything to scare me.’
