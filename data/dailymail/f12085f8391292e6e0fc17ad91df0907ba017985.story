'Miss! The volcano, it’s erupting!'

The voice of our waiter interrupts the near stupor my mouthful of pasta alla Norma has induced as he rushes to our table. Clutching my glass of red wine harvested on the slopes of Mount Etna – the very volcano that is spitting out fiery bursts of orange lava in the distance - I rush over to the terrace to watch the spectacle.

There is no need to be alarmed. Minor eruptions are common (a far more impressive eruption will occur just days after our visit), and locals of the Sicilian town of Taormina barely raise an eyebrow.

'The Monte Carlo of Sicily': The town has attracted royalty and nobility over the years, as well as celebrities including Elizabeth Taylor, Robert Redford, Cary Grant, and Audrey Hepburn

Given my amazement upon hearing that they often wake to find the hotel terrace covered in a light dusting of volcanic ash, our waiter knew I’d not want to miss seeing the eruption with my own eyes. Alas, my eyes aren’t co-operating, being hopelessly short-sighted.

Within moments, another waiter appears at my elbow, flourishing a tray of spectacles of varying prescriptions. 

Such is the service at this grand establishment. As the first hotel in Taormina, Grand Hotel Timeo has an illustrious history welcoming royalty, film stars and notable figures since its opening in 1874. 

The panoramic hotel terrace is the place to be seen during the annual film festival. Past attendees have included Elizabeth Taylor, Robert Redford, Cary Grant, Tom Cruise, Audrey Hepburn and Robert DeNiro. Every June, the picturesque resort town transforms into a mini Cannes. 

Indeed, Taormina has been likened to the Monte Carlo of Sicily. Truman Capote spent time working from a villa in town in 1951. The beautiful surroundings are even said to have inspired the inception of Lady Chatterley’s Lover during D.H. Lawrence’s two-year residency in the 1920s.

Pool with a view: The infinity pool at Belmond Villa Sant'Andrea in Mazzaro Bay overlooks the beach 

Colourful streets lined with designer boutiques open onto piazzas crowded with well-heeled holidaymakers. Vibrant Bougainvillea tumbles from windowsills and music trickles out of every restaurant. 

A cable car ride down the steep hill will find the pebbly beaches, crammed in the height of summer with sun loungers adorned with beautiful bronzed bodies. Super yachts clutter the horizon, while smaller vessels ferry tourists in and out of the Blue Grotto caves.

Wonderful hikes up the hillside with views of the glittering Ionian Sea help to work off the decadent Sicilian cuisine.

The local breakfast is Granita – what we would perceive as dessert at home, but here it seems perfectly reasonable to start the day with an icy treat topped with cream and mopped up with sweet Brioche bread.

By the seaside: Crystal clear water and Blue Grottos create a playground for tourists and day trippers

I make it my duty to sample every variation I can find of the aforementioned local specialty, pasta alla Norma - made with fried eggplant, tomatoes, basil and ricotta cheese.

Every meal is finished with cannoli or cassata, a delicious cake topped with a peculiar neon green icing.

Mount Etna looms over the town in the distance, a constant presence, and lazily puffs smoke in our direction for the duration of our visit. She is at her most spectacular at dawn, bathed in an inky purple light.

We are struck by how many fellow visitors we meet reveal that this is their fifth - or fifteenth - holiday here. There is something special about Taormina; some magic that draws back visitors again and again. 

Luxury: Private hotel beaches cater to your every whim

Perhaps it’s the undeniably romantic setting (we witness a handful of weddings taking place across a few days). Or the thrilling beauty of a medieval town on the doorstep of a volatile volcano. It could be the Sicilian hospitality. Or dessert for breakfast. Whatever the reason, I’m under Taormina’s spell.

Where to stay

Grand Hotel Timeo boasts the best location in Taormina, nestled below the ancient Teatro Greco, enjoying magnificent views of the sea and Mount Etna.

Service at the Timeo is unparalleled. From pool attendants that offer to settle me at a better sun lounger the moment a hint of shadow threatens to intervene on my tanning efforts to a complimentary boat excursion for hotel guests.

The glamorous pool is straight out of the 1950s, complete with a vintage ice cream cart, and guests also have use of the private beach and infinity pool at the Timeo’s equally luxurious sister hotel Villa Sant’Andrea.

Timeless: As the oldest established hotel in Taormina, the Grand Hotel Timeo excels with its unrivalled views, impeccable service and elegant suites

Where to eat

Maffei’s, just off bustling Corso Umberto, is a charming, romantic garden restaurant with warm, friendly service and fantastic seafood.

Where to drink

If you’re looking for nightlife, Morgana is the spot to be seen at. The open-air bar heaves in the summer months, so get there early to nab a table.

Ancient: Teatro Greco enjoys spectacular views across the sea and Mount Etna

What to see

Teatro Greco: The ancient Greek Theatre, located on Via Teatro Greco, offers magical views of Mount Etna from the amphitheatre. To walk around the theatre in peace, arrive between 9-10am, before the tour groups. Better yet, book a ticket to one of the summer concerts that take place in the evenings throughout July and August.

Madonna della Rocca: Hike up to the beautiful church atop the cliff to take in panoramic views of Taormina from above.

Worth the walk up: For energetic tourists, a hike up to Madonna della Rocca will be rewarded with panoramic vistas

Mount Etna: Day trips to Europe’s most active and highest volcano are available through several tour companies. At over 3000 metres above sea level, the temperature at the top is brisk – the volcano is transformed into a ski resort in the winter months.

Isola Bella: Once privately owned, the small island jutting out into the bay is now a nature reserve, accessible by a narrow pathway from the beach.
