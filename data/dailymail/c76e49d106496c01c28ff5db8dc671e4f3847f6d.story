The Queen and a host of other royals attended an Easter service at Windsor Castle today.

Her Majesty wore an elegant light blue coat and matching hat for the ceremony, which took place at St George's Chapel in the grounds of the Berkshire-based royal residence.

Also at the service were the Duke of Edinburgh, Sophie, Countess of Wessex, Princess Anne and Princess Eugenie.

A portrait of the Queen by the renowned British photographer David Bailey was released today to mark her 88th birthday tomorrow.

The photograph of the monarch, smiling, was taken at Buckingham Palace in March and commissioned on behalf of the Government's GREAT Britain campaign.

The image will be used in activity to support the campaign, which aims to generate jobs and growth through highlighting Britain as a world-class destination for trade, tourism, investment and education.

Meanwhile the Archbishop of Canterbury used his Easter sermon to highlight the hardship of people suffering from conflict around the world and in Britain.

Speaking at Canterbury Cathedral, Archbishop Justin Welby said: 'In Syria mothers cry for their children and husbands. In the Ukraine neighbours cry because the future is precarious and dangerous.

'In Rwanda tears are still shed each day as the horror of genocide is remembered.

'In this country, even as the economy improves there is weeping in broken families, in people ashamed to seek help from food banks, or frightened by debt.

'Asylum seekers weep with loneliness and missing far away families. Mary continues to weep across the world.'

Delivering only his second Easter message since becoming head of the Church of England, the Most Rev Justin Welby praised the resilience of persecuted Christian minorities around the globe.

'Their certainty that Jesus is alive enables them to face all horrors with joy,' the Archbishop said.

'I remember sitting in a room with the Bishop who had come over from Pakistan soon after the attack in September on a church in Peshawar.

'I asked how Christians were coping with the fear that such attacks brought, and wondered if there had been anyone in church the week following the attack. "Oh yes" the bishop replied, "there were three times as many people the next week".'

The Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu also used his Easter Day sermon at York Minster to highlight a wide range of issues, from gender-based violence and tax avoidance to fighting in Syria and the Central African Republic.

He said: 'Sadly, we have forgotten our memory as people who have been rescued, and we have become senile.

'Human trafficking, child sexual abuse, citizen indiscriminatingly killing citizen in the Central African Republic, Syria, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo; gender-based violence, tax avoidance, embezzlement of government funds in many parts of the world, hunger, poverty, lack of drinking water, and preventable diseases in our global village; and the use of stereotypical language that diminishes people we happen to disagree with, are all the fruit of our wilful senility.

'We were all rescued, redeemed by the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Let us recover our memory and become who we are. A people rescued.'
