Almost 100,000 British pensioners living in warm countries including Spain, France and Greece are to lose their winter fuel payments in a crackdown on ‘sunshine benefits’.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has hammered out details of a new ‘temperature test’ that will remove the handout, worth up to £300 a year, from such expats.

In total, it will mean that payments are stopped to 92,983 residents of Spain, France, Greece, Portugal, Malta, Cyprus and Gibraltar, he revealed. Taxpayers will save almost £17million a year.

Mr Duncan Smith said countries where the average annual temperature is higher than the warmest region of the UK – the South West at 5.6C (42F) – will be affected.

Italy is not included because its northern region has a winter climate colder than that of the British Isles. Its exclusion means 1,859 Britons will still be able to claim the benefit, even if they live in the warmer south.

There has been increasing controversy over pensioners’ free TV licences, bus passes and winter fuel payments, with half the Cabinet arguing that they should be reined in if further squeezes on working-age welfare are to be justified.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has hammered out details of a new ‘temperature test’ that will remove the handout, worth up to £300 a year, from such expats.

But David Cameron pledged at the last election that the payments would be protected until 2015 – and there has been months of wrangling over whether to begin reining them in for expats. Almost £2million goes abroad every week to claimants who still qualify for welfare despite leaving the UK.

Traditionally, people were only eligible for the winter fuel payment if they were living in Britain at the age of 60 and only moved out later.

But thanks to a ruling by the European Court of Justice, the UK would have been forced to pay out to all 444,000 British pensioners living abroad – costing up to £100million a year.

The court insisted that any  elderly expat should be able to get the payment, no matter when they left Britain.

There has already been a 13-fold rise in the number of expats claiming in the last decade.

The
 biggest expat population is in Spain, where 49,443 pensioners are 
receiving the payment, worth £200 for the over-60s and £300 for those 
over the age of 80, costing taxpayers £8.85million a year.

But in December and January temperatures in Spain can reach 17C (63F).

There
 are almost 28,625 recipients in France, many of them in the south where
 temperatures in winter are often a comfortable 13C (57F).

Controversially, the new regime will mean richer pensioners who have 
emigrated to colder countries – or warm parts of Italy – will continue 
to receive the payments, while poorer pensioners will lose it if they 
are in warmer areas.

In total, it will mean that payments are stopped to 92,983 residents of Spain, France, Greece, Portugal, Malta, Cyprus and Gibraltar, he revealed. Taxpayers will save almost £17million a year

Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘The huge increase in UK winter fuel payments made to people living in European countries equates to a near doubling in costs to the British taxpayer and follows a ridiculous ruling by the European Court of Justice.

‘The winter fuel payment is intended to help British pensioners with heating costs. From winter 2015/16, we are changing the rules so that it no longer goes to people in European countries with an average winter temperature higher than the warmest part of the UK.’

The number of winter fuel payments made to people in the European Economic Area and Switzerland for winter 2012/13 was 119,587, an increase of 44,901 on 2011/12.
