Wellington's boots, Napoleon's cloak, and a blood-stained saw used to amputate an aristocrat's leg are among the extraordinary artefacts from the Battle of Waterloo which have gone on display to mark the its 200th anniversary.

The historic objects are among 200 digital images which are being posted on a website intended to give the public new insight into the 1815 conflict in Belgium.

Others include a breastplate with a huge hole where a British cannonball smashed through it, killing the unlucky soldier, and dentures made from the teeth of troops who'd fallen in the battle.

Historic: Wellington's boots, left, and Napoleon's cloak, right, are among the artefacts in a new online exhibition on the Battle of Waterloo

Destroyed: This cuirass was worn by a French soldier who was killed by a cannonball on the battlefield

Gruesome: A blood-stained glove and saw used by a field surgeon to amputate the leg of the Earl of Uxbridge

The collection was assembled from the holdings of the National Army Museum in London, and supplemented with loans from other museums and private collections.

The first 100 objects in the collection, which is known as 'Waterloo200', are currently available to view on the project's website, and the others will be added in the run-up to the actual anniversary date on June 18.

A pair of boots worn by the Duke of Wellington were designed by the British general himself to be suitable both on the battlefield and at high-society parties.

They took off on London's social scene after he led Britain to victory, and to this day rubber boots are still known as 'Wellingtons' in his honour.

Napoleon's cloak, also featured in the online exhibition, is decorated with Arabic designs, reflecting his fascination with the Middle East, and was worn by the French leader on the night before Waterloo.

The Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815 stopped the advance of Napoleon across Europe and sent the great French emperor into exile for a second and final time.

France's troops were defeated by a multi-national coalition, led by the British army under the command of the Duke of Wellington.

The armies amassed near the town of Waterloo in modern-day Belgium, not far from the border with France, and it was the French who made the first move around 11am.

The two sides clashed for 10 hours, with the British fending off repeated attacks from the French, until Marshal Blücher arrived at the head of a Prussian army.

This was the decisive intervention which finished Napoleon off, allowing Wellington to counter-attack and forcing the Frenchman to surrender.

The battle forced Napoleon from the throne of France, leading to his exile on St Helena - but Wellington later admitted it was 'the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life'.

Despite the popular image of Waterloo as a heroic endeavour, it was also the scene of brutal slaughter as thousands of troops were killed, with the French bearing the brunt of the losses.

Many of the objects featured, however, relate not to the great generals but to the ordinary soldiers who bore the brunt of the slaughter in the battle.

One is a British penny which apparently prevented the death of an infantryman by stopping a bullet - it now bears a deep indentation where the projectile struck it.

Waterloo was the first battle in which every British serviceman was recognised for his contribution by a special medal, and one of the medals is featured in the exhibition.

Alwyn Collinson, of Waterloo 200, said: 'The Battle of Waterloo is significant because it was the first to recognise the bravery of both the famous general and the unknown private by giving every man who took a part a medal, something which had never happened before 1815.'

Some of the objects in the archive are notably macabre - one is a piece of spine extracted from the body of a British soldier and given to his widow as a memento.

A blood-stained saw and glove used by a field surgeon to amputate the Earl of Uxbridge's leg after he was injured at Waterloo is also featured, as is the wooden artificial leg worn by the peer after his injury.

It is said that when Uxbridge was shot on the battlefield he turned to Wellington saying, 'By God, sir, I’ve lost my leg!', and the general replied, 'By God, sir, so you have!'

A French cuirass worn as body armour by a soldier is punctured by a huge hole apparently caused by a cannonball which easily penetrated the breastplate and killed its wearer.

Another unlucky participant was Corporal John Shaw, a well-known boxer before he was called up to Waterloo and killed - the virtual exhibition features a plaster cast of his skull made shortly after his death

The battle turned Wellington, later to become Prime Minister, into a national hero, and the effect it had on his fame is shown by a sign he was forced to put up at his country house in Hampshire.

The sign reads: 'Those desirous of seeing the interior of the house are requested to ring at the door of entrance and to express their desire. It is wished that the practice of stopping on the paved walk to look in at the windows should be discontinued.'

As well as photographs of the 200 artefacts, the Waterloo200 website will host details of every event around Britain being held to celebrate the battle's bicentenary.

Janice Murray, director-general of the National Army Museum, said: 'The museum is really excited to see some of its most unique and fascinating objects featured in the online gallery alongside such a broad range of other collections.

'Each item featured tells an interesting story transporting viewers back to 1815 and give them a real feel for the moments before, during and after the battle.'

Another exhibition - this one physical rather than online - is being hosted by Windsor Castle, where George IV dedicated a whole room to portraits of those who fought at Waterloo.

Memorial: The castle's Waterloo Chamber was built by George IV to commemorate those who led the British army to victory
