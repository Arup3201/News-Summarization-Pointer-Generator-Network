Lazy Garlic is grown in the foothills of the Himalayas

It might not fit inside the crusher – but this new kind of garlic can be chopped or grated without the need for extensive peeling.

The same size as a traditional garlic bulb, it is not separated into smaller cloves.

This means the desired amount can simply be sliced off, avoiding the usual fiddle of peeling – and the rest stored for future use.

The product - dubbed 'lazy garlic' - has recently gone on sale at Lidl stores after the discount supermarket became the UK's only single clove garlic supplier.

A 250g basket containing around eight single cloves costs £1.49.

Single clove garlic was discovered being grown by organic farmers in the south of China in the misty foothills of the Himalayas.

Normal garlic is planted as a single seed clove which is then triggered into developing multiple cloves by cold weather.

But in the temperate climes of the Yunnan province the garlic seeds stay as a single clove, growing to around two inches in diameter.

The white and purple crop is harvested in February and March, and is said to have a milder, more fragrant taste than regular garlic.

A spokesman for Lidl said: 'The single 
clove garlic originates from the mountainous area of the Yunnan province
 in the far south west of China.'

The unique vegetable looks like a normal 
head of garlic but rather than being made up of many small segments it 
comprises just one

He continued: 'The seeds are planted approximately 2,000 metres above sea level in warm temperatures and with a large amount of sunlight.

'Only 50 per cent of the garlic seeds that are planted in these specific conditions will develop into a single clove garlic.

'This isn't a species - rather it is the conditions under which the seeds are cultivated that result in a single clove garlic.

'A single clove garlic has a high nutrition content, but it is also popular in cooking due to its slightly milder flavour compared with multi-clove garlic.

'It has a uniquely fragrant taste.

'Single clove garlic is also very easy to peel and can therefore be prepared much more quickly than multi-clove garlic.

'The feedback from our customers has been very encouraging although we have had to advise some of them about what to do with it.'
