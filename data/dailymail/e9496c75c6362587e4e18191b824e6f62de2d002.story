James McClean set up one and scored another to hand Malky Mackay his first win as Wigan manager.

The Republic of Ireland international provided the centre for Liam Cooper’s comical early own goal and then thrashed in a late second to get former Cardiff boss Mackay off the mark at the sixth attempt.

Mackay’s Wigan came into the contest six points adrift of safety in their fight against relegation and with just one victory in their last 17 Championship matches.

Their previous points haul under the Scot stood at an anaemic one and his drastic action in response to their recent home defeat to Rotherham was to drop three of their 2013 FA Cup-winning team – Emmerson Boyce, Shaun Maloney and Callum McManaman – among four changes and switch to a back three.

Yet the visiting players had barely had time to get used to the new wing-backs system when they were gifted an 11th-minute lead.

McClean’s pace down the left flank saw him outstrip Giuseppe Bellusci and although his cross from the byline suggested little danger, Cooper inexplicably chested the ball into his own net attempting to tidy things up.

Wigan had lost their previous four away trips in the league but with a rare advantage to defend restricted Leeds to minimal sights of their goal in the remainder of the opening period.

In fact, Scott Carson, who made his debut for Leeds during their life as a Premier League club, was not tested at all in the visitors’ goal.

LEEDS (4-4-2): Silvestri 7; Byram 7, Bellusci 6, Cooper 5, Warnock 6; Bianchi 6 (Morison 46mins, 6), Tonge 6, Cook 7, Mowatt 6 (Austin 46mins, 7); Sharp 6 (Doukara 71mins), Antenucci 7

Subs (Not used): Taylor, Pearce, Berardi, Montenegro

WIGAN (3-5-2): Carson 8; Perch 7, Ramis 7, Kiernan 7; Tavernier 6, Cowie 6, Watson 6, McCann 6, Taylor 6; McClean 8, Fortune 6 (Espinoza 70 mins, 6)

Subs (Not used): Al-Habsi, Riera, Maloney, McManaman, Boyce, Forshaw

Referee: Nigel Miller 7

And on the only occasion they did beat their former goalkeeper, Mirco Antenucci’s dink into the area on 28 minutes was glanced onto the crossbar from a flick of strike partner Billy Sharp’s head.

The complexion of the game changed after the interval as Leeds manager Neil Redfearn reacted to a lack of urgency and re-shaped his own team, sacrificing the Football League’s young player of the month Alex Mowatt and Tomasso Bianchi to employ Steve Morison in a three-man attack with fellow substitute Rodolph Austin offering a more direct running option from midfield.

Those changes provided Leeds with greater intensity and that was evident almost immediately as Lewis Cook’s burst into the box set up Antenucci only for a deflection to save Wigan.

Then, from the resulting corner – one of seven in the opening quarter-hour of the second period – Bellusci latched onto a half-clearance to force Carson into a spectacular tip-over from a 20-yard drive.

However, their purple patch failed to yield an equalizer and McClean – who was foiled by Leeds keeper Marco Silvestri’s legs with a rare shot with his right foot – sealed it with his left eight minutes from time when Wigan made the most of their superior numbers on a breakaway.
