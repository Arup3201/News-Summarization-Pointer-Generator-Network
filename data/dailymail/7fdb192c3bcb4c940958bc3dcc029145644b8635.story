World Champion Sebastian Vettel will be keen to forget his 100th grand prix for Red Bull. The German’s season has been plagued by reliability issues and his bad luck struck once more in Monaco when he was forced to retire after seven laps with engine gremlins. 

‘Come on, guys!’ a disgruntled Vettel shouted over the team radio before reeling in his anger: ‘I am sure you are trying everything,’ he added. The German has scored just 45 points this season. At the same stage last year he had 107 to his name.

British actor Benedict Cumberbatch conducted the post-race interviews. It was the second time he has appeared on the rostrum this season after posing the questions in Malaysia, too.

It means Cumberbatch, best known for his role in BBC drama Sherlock, has been on the top steps on more occasions than Vettel this year.

Cumberbatch was among a host of celebrities who predictably flocked to the south of France for F1’s blue-riband event. Glen Johnson, Michael Carrick and Aaron Ramsey spearheaded the Premier League’s assault on the principality while Sir Patrick Stewart, Chris Evans and Pixie Lott were there from the world of show business.

They were also joined by Justin Bieber. The popstar, not deterred by an embarrassing snub from Fernando Alosno on Saturday, then posed for a rather awkward ‘selfie’ with Bernie Ecclestone, 63 years his senior. Only in Monaco.

Marussia registered their first points-scoring result in Formula One after Jules Bianchi finished ninth yesterday. The Banbury-based team – who entered the sport as Virgin Racing in 2010 – completed the feat in their 83rd outing.

Frenchman Bianchi actually finished eighth, but was demoted one place following a five-second timing penalty for serving an earlier penalty during the safety car period.

Marussia’s rivals Caterham also secured the best result of their five-year history after Marcus Ericsson ended the race in 11th, but it is unlikely to dissuade owner Tony Fernandes from ending his association with the team.

The Queens Park Rangers chief, who watched his side bounce back to the Premier League at Wembley on Saturday, is reportedly keen to sell up for a figure said to be in the region on £350million.

Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg’s spat shouldn’t deter from the remarkable effort by their Mercedes team this season. Monaco’s race was their fifth straight 1-2 finish – a feat a Nigel Mansell-led Williams in 1992, and McLaren – in Alain Prost and Ayrton Senna in 1988 – were never able to achieve.

Can Mercedes win every race? It’s never been done before, but you wouldn’t back against them.

Streaking away: Mercedes have won all six races this season, the last five with one-two finishes
