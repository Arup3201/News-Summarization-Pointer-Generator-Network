These stunning pictures have delicately captured the true beauty of plants by reflecting them within a droplet of water. 

Bertrand Kulik describes his images as ‘little planets’ as the clear water bubble encases a full picture of nature in its simplest form. 

The 33-year-old caught the different colours that nature possesses, now that summer flowers have begun to bloom.

The 33-year-old caught the different colours that nature possesses, now that summer flowers have begun to bloom

Bertrand said that it looks like a very little world inside the same world and that the heart of the flower looks like the sun

Bertrand said: 'It looks like a very little world inside the same world.

'The contrasts are incredible and the heart of the flower looks like the sun. 

'By looking at the pictures, we can feel that we are connected with the elements.'

He gets as close as just 5cm from the flower, before planting a droplet on to the flower's seed

He uses a special lens to capture the tiny droplets and uses a Canon MP-E lens, which is specifically built for macro photography

He gets as close as just 5cm from the flower, before planting a droplet on to the flower’s seed - using a specific lens to reflect the image. 

Concert violonist Bertrand said: 'I have a little foot called a monopod, which I put on to the ground or on me to steady my camera, and then use a Canon MP-E lens, which is specifically built for macro photography.

'It’s not possible to make the focus less than 15cm.

He has taken images around his house and around the city of Paris, but said that flowers are much more graphic and delicate

A camelia contrasts red and green. he said that contrasts are very important for this type of photography

'The lens is amazing but it’s very difficult to master and I have to be very ‘zen’ when I use it. 

'I try not to breathe because of the body vibrations and when the angle is perfect for catching some nice reflections, it’s often necessary to be in a very uncomfortable for a long time.'

Bertrand, from Paris, France, has used the technique to capture 15 types of flower, including dandelions, daisies, roses, and lilacs, as well as poppies, pansies and forget-me-nots.

he said that it is so precise it's like a sport competition. It's very important to be very quiet and delicate so not to disrupt nature at it¿s finest

He often sits on the grass for a long time just to look around and feel the shapes and colours which will work best

He aims to capture the beauty of nature but does not want to disturb it

'My first picture, which is my favourite, was the entire dandelion,' he said. 

'After that I tried some daisies, which have a yellow centre, like the sun. 

'Contrasts are very important for this type of picture, and I wanted to make a series with different flowers of the seasons. 

'The colours are crucial and often I have to sit on the grass for a long time just to look around and feel the shapes and colours which will work best.'

Bertrand, who used a Canon Eos 7D camera to capture the incredible images, had the idea after taking reflects around his home for a number of years. 

He said: 'I have taken reflects in my house and around the city of Paris, but flowers are much more graphic and delicate. 

'I think it is very impressive to see the drops on the seed of a dandelion, and it is a beautiful picture. 

'I use my hand as a little umbrella and use my other hand to take the picture. 

'It’s so precise it’s like a sport competition, so it’s very important to be very quiet and delicate so not to disrupt nature at it’s finest.'
