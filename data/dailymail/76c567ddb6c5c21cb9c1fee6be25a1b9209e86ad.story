One of Australia's most iconic animals sought a change of scenery from it's usual leafy gumtree hideout, taking a casual stroll along the sandy beaches of Queensland's Magnetic Island.

One curious koala was spotted by a surprised tourist clambering down from a tree and exploring the shoreline of the island.

The footage shows the inquisitive creature as it caught some ocean views, calmly edging it's way to the water before stopping to look at the waves lapping the sand, seemingly transfixed by the motion.

Magnetic Island is well known for it's koala population, with the species numbers growing in past years to 600

The koala appeared to be in no hurry to leave, and was not startled by the audience it has gathered who were watching it's antics.

Trent Cowan, 30, works at the island's backpacker accommodation and said that reports of koalas wandering down onto the beach, or even through the bar where he serves, is quite commonplace on the island.

'It's pretty normal for them to wander through the hostel,' Mr Cowan said.

'They don't seem to be that bothered, they just continue on their way, doing what they're doing, being lazy and chilled out,' he said.

Tourists staying on the island are usually pretty excited when one wanders though, and Mr Cowan said that some will even take selfies with the inquisitive creatures.

'The paparazzi definitely comes out. People get pretty excited, because many haven't seen one in the wild before,' he said.

'They don't want to be touched or picked up, but they do sometimes just wander through reception.' 

Mr Cowan only recently caught a koala which had an injury to it's eye, after several reports of koala sightings came in over the space of one weekend.  

'It looked like it was blind, and it's still in care,' he said.

Professor Krockenberger and his team have been studying the population of koalas on the island and have said that the number is very healthy

Koalas are often spotted among the nearby habitats of eucalypt forest, with the rest of the island comprising of wetlands, mangroves and coastal dunes

James Cook University's Professor Andrew Krockenberger said  that 'It is not normal, we don't see that very often, however it is not so abnormal that I've never heard of this before. Koalas found in islands of the Noosa River are known to even swim between islands,' said

'Any time that a koala is not in a gumtree eating leaves people think it needs to be rescued, because it is somehow in trouble. They are interested, they see something a little bit different and they go to have a look,' he told The ABC.

'They have come down from trees close to the rocks where people are fishing, had a bit of a look at them and then wandered off up to another tree,' 

'So it is clearly within their behavioural repertoire to indulge in this sort of activity every now and then, but every time it does happen people are quite surprised by it,' he said.

Magnetic Island is well known for it's koala population, with the species numbers growing in past years to 600.

Koalas first appeared on the island during the 20th century, and were not a native species to the island when Europeans first landed in the area.

Professor Krockenberger and his team have been studying the population of koalas on the island and have said that the number is very healthy, reported The ABC.  

'In around the 1920s and 1930s there was a lot of concern about koalas and there was a bit of an Australia-wide push to conserve koalas,' said Professor Krockenberger.

'People also started to make little sanctuaries for them and bring them to different islands and Magnetic Island was one of those islands,' he said.

Female koalas on the island have one baby each year, according to the research done by Prof. Krockenberger and his team.

Koalas are often spotted among the nearby habitats of eucalypt forest, with the rest of the island comprising of wetlands, mangroves and coastal dunes.
