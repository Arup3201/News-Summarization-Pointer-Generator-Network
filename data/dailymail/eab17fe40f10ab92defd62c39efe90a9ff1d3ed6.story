Locked up: Exeter university cleaner Szczepan Majcherczyk has been jailed after groping students and shoppers over a four-day period - and then blaming it on his upbringing in rural Poland

A university cleaner has been jailed after groping students and shoppers over a four-day period - and then blaming it on his upbringing in rural Poland.

Szczepan Majcherczyk worked as a cleaner at 
Exeter University and used his pass to get into the library where he 
spent an hour staring at a female student before offering her a condom and asking for sex.

The 32-year-old also approached a first-year 
student near St James Park station in Exeter, putting his hand onto her 
bottom and inside her shorts, and groped a 
17-year-old girl through her leggings in a separate attack.

CCTV cameras also captured the father-of-one touching a young customer at Exeter’s Royal Albert Memorial Museum and approaching a complete stranger in Tesco to ask her for sex.

At Exeter Crown Court, Majcherczyk, from Exeter, admitted three sexual assaults and two offences of threatening behaviour.

Judge Francis Gilbert, who jailed Majcherczyk for 21 months, told him he should be deported back to Poland.

'The Home Office will look at deportation. If it was up to me I would deport you' Judge Gilbert said.

'The suggestion there may be a cultural background to these offences due to your upbringing in rural Poland is one I reject utterly.

'These offences were alarming and shocking and totally unexpected by the victims. You told the student in the University library in pretty blunt terms you wanted to have sex with her and offered her a condom.

'In Tesco you propositioned another young lady and in lewd terms which were bound to embarrass and distress her.'

Mr Gareth Evans, prosecuting, said Majcherczyk’s crime spree started on February 16 when he approached a woman at the museum in Exeter and asked for a date, telling her there were a lot of nice women there.

She refused but then felt him standing uncomfortable close to him before he touched her on her bottom, forcing her to grab his hand and move it away.

The next assault happened just hours later on the same evening when he approached an 18-year-old first year student near St James Park station and put his hand onto her bottom and inside her shorts, touching intimate areas through her thick leggings.

Two days later another student was working in the library and became alarmed to see him staring at her across a table for an hour. He then asked her for sex and pulled out the condom which he left on her chair.

The next assault happened as a 17-year-old girl was walking home in Exeter and was approached from behind and groped through her leggings.

The final incident happened at Tesco where he approached a young woman shopper and offered to carry her bags before asking to take her home so they could spend the night together.

He was caught on CCTV and identified by staff because he had worked as a cleaner at the High Street store before moving to the university.

Mr Warren Robinson, defending, said Majcherczyk has lived in Britain for eight years and has a five-year-old child but his relationship had broken down and he was depressed and drinking too much at the time of the offences.

He said: 'During these few days he was relying on alcohol too much and perhaps fell back to older and inappropriate cultural values from his childhood in rural Poland.'

Majcherczyk was also put on the sex offenders’ register and told to pay a £100 victim surcharge.
