Britain’s top prosecutor was yesterday forced to deny conducting a ‘witch-hunt’ against journalists after tens of millions of pounds were spent investigating them.

MPs accused Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders of needlessly ruining lives by pursuing reporters over allegations then allowing them to languish on bail without being charged.

Police and prosecutors have been criticised for arresting journalists on suspicion of a range of offences in the wake of phone-hacking allegations, rather than concentrating on terrorism, violent crime and serious fraud.

An ongoing four-year investigation into alleged wrongdoing by reporters had cost £33.5million up to the end of September 2014.

Since 2011, 64 journalists have been arrested but only ten convicted, four of them being jailed. One has accepted a caution and seven have been acquitted. No further action was taken against 25 of the other journalists investigated.

Mrs Saunders was challenged as she gave evidence to the Commons Home Affairs select committee on police bail, following concerns suspects are being left in limbo.

Conservative MP Michael Ellis said: ‘Are you conducting – you, the Crown Prosecution Service – a witch-hunt?

‘It is being suggested by more and more people that a witch-hunt is being conducted against journalists and celebrities.

‘Is it because of the groundswell of attention in this area that you are pursing these cases with insufficient evidence?’

Mrs Saunders said: ‘We are not conducting a witch-hunt against anyone, be it journalists or celebrities.

'We do not make any distinction when we look at cases as to who it is we are looking at. What we look at is the evidence.’

She insisted decisions should not be ‘made in haste’.
