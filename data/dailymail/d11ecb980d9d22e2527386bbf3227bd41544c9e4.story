A seven-year-old Salvadoran cancer sufferer has finally been released from an immigrant detention center in Texas so that she can get treatment for her brain tumor after weeks of delays.

Following uproar from advocacy groups, Nayely Bermudez Beltran and her mother, Sara Beltran Rodriguez, were allowed to leave the Karnes County Residential Center on Wednesday night so that the little girl can undergo treatment next week.

The duo fled violence in El Salvador in July and when they entered the U.S., Beltran immediately told border patrol officers that the girl needed medical attention, the Houston Chronicle reported.

But they were transferred to the center in Karnes County without Nayely undergoing any treatment - and even though they had a place to stay, authorities would not release them or set bail,Grassroots Leadership explained.

Relief: Nayely Bermudez Beltran and her mother, Sara, grin after they are released from an immigrant detention center on Wednesday - allowing the seven-year-old girl to undergo treatment for her brain tumor

Brave: The little girl had previously undergone chemotherapyfor her brain tumor in El Salvador but she had to stop her treatments when she and her mother fled the violence in their home city

As the mother and daughter awaited answers, the youngster became increasingly ill and started wetting the bed because of her condition, Beltran said.

Nayely also previously had a shunt put in her brain during surgery in El Salvador and it could have malfunctioned at any time, killing her or leaving her brain damaged, according to their lawyer. 

'We were waiting for a month, and no one would do anything,' Beltran, 27, said. 'I felt anguished.' 

Finally, on August 18, the duo passed a credible fear screening - the first hurdle towards asylum - but authorities still would not release the youngster for treatment, Grassroots Leadership said. 

Their lawyer, Kate Lincoln-Goldfinch, who is representing them pro bono, was able to obtain the girl's medical records and they were evaluated by three U.S. doctors.

Concern: After reviewing Nayely's medical records, Austin-based Dr. Simon Carlson (pictured) urged customs to release the little girl, saying that she could die or be left brain damaged if not treated immediately

Fighters: The mom and daughter, pictured on Wednesday, were helped by immigrant advocacy groups

One of the doctors, neurologist Dr. Simon Carlson, urged ICE to release the girl, saying that her health could 'take a turn for the worse with little to no forewarning, with devastating outcomes'.

'Urgent care is needed for this child, and she is likely to suffer long term brain damage or worse if left to routine care without urgent specialist intervention,' he said.  

On Wednesday, the agency finally released the pair and they went to a shelter in Austin, according to Texans United for Families, which helped fight for their release.

Photographs taken outside the shelter show the mother and daughter grinning with their lawyer.

'Nayely and Sara just walked out of the Karnes family detention center,' the caption read. 'They are on their way to a warm and welcoming place in Austin and Nayely is going to see a doctor on Tuesday.'

Detained: They had been held at the Karnes County Residential Center (pictured), a new center in Texas, even though they said Nayely required urgent medical attention. Weeks later, they have finally left

The Houston Chronicle reported that it is unclear exactly what made the agency change its mind.

Dell Children's Medical Center of Central Texas in Austin has agreed to evaluate Nayely next week - and might even cover the costs.

Beltran and her daughter are also scheduled for a hearing on Thursday. 

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement would not comment on the case.
