Behind bars: Joel Nasser, 63, was jailed for nine years after forcing his lover to jump out of a window from his third-floor flat - impaling her hip on the railings below

A former security guard has been jailed for nine years after forcing his lover to jump out of a third-floor window - impaling herself on the railing below.

Joel Nasser, 63, attacked Aniela Zawistoska with a coathanger after the pair had sex at his luxury mansion flat in Kensington, west London.

Nasser then lunged at her, causing the terrified half-naked 38-year-old to jump 20ft on to the wall railing, which pierced through her hip and buttock.

An off-duty doctor doctor who happened to be passing by stemmed the blood before she was rushed to St Mary's Hospital by air ambulance.

She was put in a medically-induced 
coma and taken to intensive care where she received treatment to remove 
part of the railings from her hip and buttock.

Ms Zawistoska also suffered numerous fractures to her hip, pelvis, ribs and back, as well as a 'great deal' of blood loss.

Nasser claimed his victim was leaning out of the window and slipped. He also said she had been taking drugs before she fell.

But a jury found him guilty of grievous bodily harm with intent following a two-week trial at the court.

Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith told Nasser at Southwark Crown Court that it was 'remarkable' Ms Zawistoska survived.

He added: 'Rightly or wrongly you were convinced that the victim had stolen from you on two occasions.

'You clearly had a fair amount to drink and on your own admission, took a large amount of cocaine.

'You thought she had stolen money 
from your pocket.

'In my view, the evidence points very strongly to the 
fact that you then lost your temper.

'This was your flat and you knew the height from which she would fall and clearly intended to cause her serious harm.

'In truth, it is remarkable that she survived. This assault must have dramatically altered her life for the worse.

'What you did was witnessed by three independent witnesses who were horrified if not seriously traumatised by what they had seen.

'Throughout the trial you have never indicated a hint of remorse about what you did.'

Nasser's co-defendant, Halima Badamasi, 28, from Harlesden Road, northwest London, was cleared of the same charge on the direction of Judge Loraine-Smith.

The victim been invited to the party at Nasser's home in Chiltern Street, Marylebone, last Halloween, where guests drank and smoked cannabis.

In her statement, the victim said she had sex with Nasser during her visit to his flat.

'Afterwards, he accused her of stealing his money,' said prosecutor Lesley Jones.

'She says she was then attacked by Mr Nasser and he used coathangers lying around the flat.'

Michael Newport, defending, said Nasser spent many years working as a security guard for the Saudi Arabian Information Centre, but had struggled to find a new job after being laid off.

'What happened was no doubt fuelled by a high level of intoxication,' Mr Newport conceded. Â
