A doctor testified today that a mother who glued her two-year-old daughter's hands to a wall also beat the toddler so badly that she suffered significant brain trauma and bleeding inside her skull.

Elizabeth Escalona pleaded guilty on July 12 to injury to a child. The 23-year-old mother is being sentenced today. She faces up to life in prison. A state district judge will decide her punishment.

The doctor showed photos of the beaten 
child in court this morning in which she had bruises, cuts and bite 
marks all over her body shortly after she was brought to Children’s 
Medical Center in Dallas.

On the day of the attack Escalona changed her Facebook profile photo to one of her and Jocelyn and wrote: 'Why does God put obstacles in my life?'

Some of her hair had been pulled out and there was glue in her eyelashes and on her hands.

The toddler was in a coma for two days after the September 7, 2011, incident.

Police records show the toddler's siblings told investigators their mother repeatedly kicked the girl in the stomach and hit her with various objects before gluing her hands to the wall because of potty training.

Dr Amy Barton, a child abuse pediatrician who worked at the hospital at the time, cried when she testified about the injuries, according to the Dallas Morning News.

'The entire picture was very shocking. I see a lot of children and this was one of the most shocking things that I’ve seen.'

The section of the wall the toddler's hands were glued to was cut out and presented to the court.

She previously said of the case: 'I have no comment, and only God can judge me. That’s all I gotta say.'

The toddler, Joselyn Cedillo, was 
briefly on a life support nachine.

According to police records, glue and
paint were stuck to her palms, with skin torn away in places.

The girl was rushed to hospital after Escalona called her mother and said there was something wrong with her daughter.

When the child's grandmother got to the house, the girl was unresponsive.

According to police reports, Escalona dragged her daughter by her feet before gluing her hands to the wall until they bled.

Police said that numerous people had seen the suspect inflict pain on her daughter in the past.
