Neymar has potentially cooked up a World Cup storm by sporting a pair of Beats by Dre headphones - even after players were specifically told they were banned from the tournament.

Brazil's talisman wore the merchandise at a press conference on Wednesday ahead of their quarter-final against Colombia in two days time.

The incident comes after world governing body FIFA struck an agreement with Sony for the rights during the month-long showpiece.

Neymar was talking at the base for Luiz Felipe Scolari's side in Teresopolis before a clash with the James Rodriguez-inspired Colombians in Fortaleza.

The 22-year-old dragged the Selecao kicking and screaming through the group stages, finding the net four times, before smoothly knocking in the decisive penalty against Chile in the last-16.

Any lingering fitness worries were quashed by Neymar himself, who declared himself fit.

'I am able to play against Colombia, he said. 'I have no pain. I feel very well trained and rest assured, I'm fine.'

Players from all 32 competing countries were told they mustn't wear Beats' product during media briefings and on matchdays.

They were all sent free pairs of Sony's gear to wear, but few have been spotted using them.

Marketing experts say that only amplifies their appeal.

'When
 fans see World Cup athletes wearing Beats in their downtime, by choice,
 it has as much impact as seeing them lace their Adidas (boots) or sip a
 sponsored beverage,' strategist Ellen Petry Leanse, a former Apple and 
Google executive, said last month.
