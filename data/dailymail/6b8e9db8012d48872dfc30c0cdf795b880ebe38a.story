A federal judge dismissed indictments on Thursday against 10 of 28 Washington D.C. defendants in major drug cases pending an investigation into an FBI agent who may have tampered with evidence including guns and narcotics, authorities say.

The alleged misconduct of the unnamed agent has led to the release of more than 20 prisoners, one of whom had been serving a sentence of up to 10 years, according to the Washington Post. 

More cases will be dropped and more prisoners may be released. Those who have already entered guilty pleas can withdraw them and their charges will be dropped, according to The Crime Report.

The government plans to dismiss 28 cases in all. 

Released: A federal judge dismissed indictments against 10 of 28 defendants in drug cases pending an investigation by Michael Horowitz, inspector general for the Department of Justice (above), into an FBI agent accused of tampering with evidence  

The Post reports that the investigation began the week of Sept. 29, coinciding with the time officials say the agent was found slumped over the wheel of his unmarked FBI vehicle with empty bags in the car believed to have contained drugs.

Never: Robert Lee Jenkins Jr., a lawyer defending one of the released felons who admitted a drug conspiracy charge, said he had 'never seen something like this before'

The agent, assigned to a D.C. police task force in the FBI’s Washington Field Office, has not been criminally charged but has been suspended indefinitely, authorities say.  He is being investigated by the inspector general's office at the Justice Department. 

The nature of the agent's alleged misconduct has not been made public, and defense lawyers involved in the affected cases have said that the mass freeing of convicted felons is 'unprecedented.' 

It is reportedly not uncommon for cases to be dropped due to police misconduct, however freeing those who have been found guilty is unusual. 

Though the investigation's details have not been made public, the agent's alleged tampering has had, what authorities call, a 'significant' impact on substantial drug cases.

One of those cases includes 13 drug gang members and their alleged ringleader 62-year-old Lester Pryor who allegedly imported cocaine from California into the District, Virginia, and Maryland.

All members, including Lester, have been freed from jail or prison, according to the Post.

This delivers a blow to the FBI who conducted a year-long investigation into the group resulting in the raid of 26 homes, the seizing of 11 pounds of drugs, and thousands of hours of secretly recorded telephone calls. 

Information about the investigation had been filed under seal, but information was leaked after a judge quietly ordered the release of more than 12 felons and others with pending charges last month.

Robert Lee Jenkins Jr., a lawyer defending one of the released felons who had entered a guilty plea to a drug conspiracy charge, told the Post that he had 'never seen something like this before,' referring to the release of the prisoners.

'It suggests to me that whatever is going on is very significant,' Jenkins said. 

U.S. Attorney's Office: Ronald Machen, the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, is working with the office to do a case-by-case review of all matters in which the agent was involved

Another affected case involves 10 defendants accused of selling cocaine and heroin in the District; prosecutors reportedly filed papers saying they would drop charges against the defendants. 

Another substantial case that may be affected by the agent's misconduct is the case of a drug organization reportedly led by Juan Floyd that led to the indictment of thirty-three people. None have been released.   

The freeing of defendants has begun, but the situation may not be limited to the total of 28 defendants. 

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia is conducting a case-by-case review of matters in which the agent is believed to have been involved.
