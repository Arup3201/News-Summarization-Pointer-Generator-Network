Love was quite literally in the air for an unsuspecting cook when her boyfriend proposed to her at 500 feet.

Instructor Stuart Black was giving girlfriend Annette MacKenzie her first flying lesson when he asked her to look down into a field.

'Marry me Annettte' had been carved in 25-foot long letters into the stubble field below and when she looked back Mr Black was holding a diamond engagement ring.

She said yes straight away.

With a little help from his friends: Stuart Black got farmer school mate John Watt to carve the proposal into the field in 25-foot long letters

The groom-to-be had originally planned on popping the question at Christmas but brought it forward as he is due to leave for the Gulf for four months on duty with the RAF.

Ms MacKenzie, from Dunvegan, Isle of Skye, said she had no idea he was planning to propose.

The 37-year-old said: 'It was such a surprise, I haven’t quite got over it yet.

'I was so nervous doing a flying lesson for the first time and then all of a sudden Stuart said I should look down at the field outside as I might see something.

'We had just flown over Gleneagles so I thought it was going to be another big building or something, but there were all these words and I couldn’t quite take them all in.

'I turned around and there was Stuart holding a ring and it all clicked.

'Normally he can’t keep anything quiet so I’m amazed I never found out beforehand.'

The pair live more than 200 miles apart and first met on Facebook two years ago but only saw each other face-to-face in December.

They have yet to set a date but are considering marrying in December next year - two years after they first 'clicked'.

Mr Black, 39, of Crieff, Perthshire, said the dramatic proposal had taken months of planning and he enlisted the help of his childhood friend John Watt, who a farm.

Mr Black said: 'At first I had this idea of proposing in the air while Annette was having a flying lesson, as it would be something different.

'Then I thought, why not have something marked out on the ground?

'So I contacted my friend John who owns a farm and we came up with a plan to carve a proposal into a field.

'He used a machine which just cuts the first three inches into the field and the letters were 25 metres long - it was massive.

'I suppose I just wanted to do something unique.'

But the carefully laid plan almost did not come to fruition when the weather was too bad to fly.

Mr Black had arranged an early 'Christmas Day' with his family so he could celebrate before going on the RAF tour to the Gulf at the end of the month.

He had intended to propose on November 15 but he could not fly.

But luckily, for Mr Black a window of clear sky the following meant they could take to the skies.

He said: 'Annette thought the flying lesson was just a Christmas present so she was absolutely stunned when I proposed.

'She turned around and saw me holding the ring out to her and it’s fair to say she was quite emotional and she said ‘yes’ straight away, which was lovely.

'We had all the family up for our early Christmas and of course they were waiting with the bubbly back at home - so it was quite special.'

On their unusual courtship, school caterer Ms MacKenzie said: 'We had mutual friends and I think Stuart just added me as a friend one day and we just got chatting, then we began phoning and emailing too.

'Last December Stuart came up the Skye to meet me for the first time and we just clicked.”

Her future-husband added: 'It was quite a bizarre way of meeting someone and now here we are engaged.'
