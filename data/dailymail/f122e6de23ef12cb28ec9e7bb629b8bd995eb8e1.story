A Virginia family is campaigning to encourage a drug company to allow their sick little boy who is fighting for his life access to life-saving medicine.

Josh Hardy, a seven-year-old cancer survivor, needs a drug called Brincidofovir, made by small North Carolina drug company Chimerex, to fight off a viral infection he developed after a recent bone marrow transplant.

The drug has not been approved by the FDA, but it has been administered to hundreds of other patients under 'compassionate use' allowances.

Fighter: Seven-year-old Josh Hardy has survived four bouts of kidney cancer, heart failure and a bone marrow transplant

Chimerex CEO Kenneth Moch told Fox News that the company made the decision two years ago to stop the compassionate use program, saying they 'cannot afford it' anymore.

'As we progressed to larger and more complex safety trials, we made the decision two years ago to stop the program and focus resources on earning FDA approval,' Moch said.

Moch says that saying yes to Josh would mean saying yes to many more patients, draining the company's resources and delaying the time it will take for the drug to progress through the formal studies required before it can be given FDA approval and help many more future patients.

However, the company received $72 million in federal funding to develop Brincidofovir.

Josh Hardy's mother, Aimee Hardy, says the situation is devastating, especially for a boy who has fought so hard to live.

'There’s no good excuse for us,' she said. 'There’s nothing they can say that will really keep us from asking. We’re begging them to give it to us.'

Mother: Aimee Hardy appeared on Fox and Friends, saying she was infuriated that she was not sitting by her son's side and holding his hand, but had to campaign so that he could get the medicine he needs

Courageous: Josh has already battled cancer four times in his seven years

Josh Hardy was diagnosed with cancer of the kidneys in 2007. Since then, he has battled the disease four times.

He had been in remission for two years when a bone scan in November of 2013 revealed he had developed a bone marrow disorder due to earlier cancer treatments.

In January of this year he had a bone marrow transplant and endured another round of chemotherapy at St Jude's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.

Following the successful surgery he  developed adenovirus, an infection that can be deadly in people with weakened immune systems.

'Normally, Josh’s immune system would be able to handle the adenovirus if his immune system was set free,' Hardy wrote on her son’s CaringBridge page.

'The challenge is his immune system 
can’t be set free yet because his body is still trying to adapt to the 
new bone marrow cells. So to keep the body from killing the new cells, 
they have to suppress the immune system, thus creating ideal conditions 
for adenovirus to advance. Catch 22.'

Deadly virus: Josh is in hospital battling a virus that could claim his life, even though a drug exists that could cure it

In his hands: Kenneth Moch, CEO of Chimerex, says the company no longer has a 'compassionate use' program

Brincidofovir has been shown to clear up adenovirus in children in two weeks, reports Fox and Friends.

Josh's doctors have also contacted Chimerex requesting their patient be allowed to have the drug, to no avail.

'I feel that it’s just an excuse and we need them to totally change their stance, not only for us but for hundreds or even thousands of people that need [this drug],' Hardy told Fox and Friends.

'…To me, [it’s] almost a crime to not make it available to everyone who needs it.'

Aimee Hardy has launched a campaign to save her son, and says she will not stop until Josh gets the medicine, even though the fight is stealing precious moments she could be spending with her son.

'I want to be by his bedside, holding his hand, telling him, "It’s going to be okay," but because of this unwillingness to release this drug, I have to leave him and come talk to you and it infuriates me,' Hardy told Fox and Friends.

Curable: Josh is suffering from a curable virus that's preying on him because of his compromised immune system

A chance to live: The little boy has been in and out of hospital for much of his short life, never having a chance to do the things other little boys get to

Kenneth Moch said that even a visit to see Josh at St. Jude would not change his mind about letting the child have the medicine. Aimee Hardy told Fox and Friends what Moch would see if he visited Josh's bedside.

'He would see a frail little boy who has a very weak voice and has a hard time staying awake because he’s in so much pain,' she said.

'It’s horrible for us as parents to see, because he’s a vibrant, strong little boy, and even though he is frail, he has a very strong will about him. But things just keep stacking against him, and we just want to do everything we can to give him the opportunity to make a full recovery.'

Moch told Fox and Friends that seeing Josh in this state would not change his mind.

'We have have great compassion for this family,' Moch says. 'But this is not just about a single boy.'

Aimee Hardy is asking supporters to call or email Chimerex or tweet @chimerex with the hashtag #savejosh.

Supporters can also track Josh's progress on the Save Josh Facebook page.
