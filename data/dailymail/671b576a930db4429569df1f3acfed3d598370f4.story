An Australian weightlifter who received a silver medal at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games says he should have won the event, after a controversial judges' decision meant he missed out on winning gold.

Simplice Ribouem, 31, looked set to win gold at the 94kg men's weightlifting event after Papua New Guinea's Steven Kari failed to lift 200kg in his final clean and jerk.

On review, the lift was deemed good by the judges, and when Ribouem failed to lift 201kg, the gold was awarded to Kari.

The jury that ruled Kari's lift was good contained a Papua New Guinean official and the wife of Kari's coach, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Ribouem, who won gold for the event at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi four years ago, did not suggest the judges had acted improperly but said the lift should have been ruled invalid because Kari's elbow touched his knee during the lift.

'I'm upset… You can't do anything. The judges decide. I was planning to bring the gold to my two sons. Unfortunately I have silver and I have to accept that,' he told the Sydney Morning Herald.

'The coach said to me: "It's ok Simplice, everyone out there is saying you won gold, Simplice, you stick that in your mind. You're a winner." I feel like a winner. [Kari] knows that.'

Australia claimed four gold overnight at the Glasgow Commonwealth Games, taking the total medal haul to 101, with 34 gold.

Swimmer Daniel Tranter, 22, who set a Games record as he took at gold in the men's 200 metre individual medley.

The victory came on the last day of swimming competition at the Games and was a stunning come-from-behind victory for Tranter, who was in seventh place after the butterfly leg and sixth after completing the backstroke leg.

Tranter pulled into first place after the breaststroke, which Tranter said was his strongest stroke.

'I've always had quite a natural and powerful breaststroke stroke... and it just so happens in the medley that the breaststroke tends to be the make-or-break leg. I'm quite lucky that my natural leg is the make or break,' he told the ABC.

Tranter maintained his lead during the 200 metre freestyle leg beating out Scotland's Daniel Wallace and South Africa's Chad le Close, who won silver and bronze respectively.

Australia won a second gold in the pool on the final night of swimming competition, with the women's 4x100metre medley team taking home the gold.

David Chapman, who won the event, received his first Commonwealth Games gold medal and set a record for the sport – hitting 23 out of 40 targets.

The 49-year-old had already set a record this Games. He and his daughter Hayley are the first father-daughter combination to represent Australia in shooting.

The medals came as the Games faced their first doping scandal, with a 16-year-old Nigerian weightlifter suspended for testing positive for banned substances.

Chika Amalaha was provisionally suspended after she tested positive for the diuretic amiloride and a masking agent, both of which are banned, making her the first athlete to test positive during the Games.
