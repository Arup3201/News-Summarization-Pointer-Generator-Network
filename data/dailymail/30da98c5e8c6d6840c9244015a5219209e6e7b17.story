He joined The Daily Show as a correspondent only three months ago.

But now, Trevor Noah has reportedly emerged as the frontrunner to replace host Jon Stewart.

The 31-year-old South African comedian has apparently been named on a short list of potential successors to Stewart, 52, who will step down from his role on the Comedy Central show this year.

He is being considered for an integral position on the program, a source close to the matter told Variety magazine. However, no final decision has yet been reached by network executives.

'Shortlisted': The 31-year-old South African comedian (pictured in 2012) has apparently been named on a short list of potential successors to Stewart, 52, who will step down from his role on the show this year

According to the source, Comedy Central's efforts to select a replacement for Stewart - who has hosted the satirical news show for a staggering 16 years - have gained speed in recent days.

Last month, shortly after Stewart revealed his plans to step down from his role, company executive Doug Herzog confirmed that a 'short list' of possible replacements had already been put together. 

He added that the channel and Stewart were consulting on when he will depart his job, as well as discussing whether he will have continue to have a role with the show he has hosted since 1999. 

When asked about a possible future role, Herzog, 55, the president of Viacom Entertainment Group, replied 'TBD', meaning 'to be determined'. He then added: 'It's not out of the question.'

If Noah - who is no stranger to tackling controversial issues on-air - replaces Stewart on The Daily Show this year, he will be joining a primarily white, male and straight late night show landscape.

At present, Comedy Central is the only network to have an African-American host: Larry Wilmore, A network spokesman declined to tell Variety whether Noah was being considered for Stewart's job.

No stranger to controversy: During his initial appearance on The Daily Show last December, Noah (pictured during the broadcast) used his mixed-race heritage and politics to amuse viewers. Referring to protests in the US over alleged police brutality, he told Stewart that his arms were 'tired' from constantly 'holding them up'

Thorny issues: 'I never thought I'd be more afraid of police in America than in South Africa,' he said, adding: 'It kind of makes me a little nostalgic for the old days back home.' He also riffed on Ebola with Stewart

Noah, who grew up in Gauteng, started his entertainment career at 18 on the South African soap opera, Isidingo. He shortly began hosting his own radio show on the region's main youth station.

Now, he is a well-known TV personality in the country, with his stand-up shows often selling out. 

In 2012, Noah became the first South African stand-up comedian to feature on NBC's The Tonight Show. The following year, he became the first to appear on CBS's Late Show With David Letterman.

During his initial appearance on The Daily Show last December, the comedian, whose mother is a black South African and father is a white Swiss, discussed race and politics to amuse viewers.

Referring to protests across the United States over alleged police brutality, he told Stewart his arms were 'tired' because he had been constantly 'holding them up' since he had arrived in America.

Positive: Over the past 24 hours, people across the country have been taking to social media to express their views on Noah as the potential new host of The Daily Show, with many deeming it 'great' news (pictured)

'A great addition': Briton Tim Browning tweeted Noah, asking: 'Any truth to rumour about the daily show?'

Hopeful: A Twitter user called Sarah said she hoped 'so badly' the comedian would be named the new host

'I never thought I'd be more afraid of police in America than in South Africa,' he said, adding: 'It kind of makes me a little nostalgic for the old days back home.' He also riffed on Ebola with Stewart.

And he challenged the host to game of 'Spot The Africa', featuring snapshots of America and Africa.

Following the article in Variety, people across the country have taken to social media to express their views on Noah as the potential new host of The Daily Show, with many deeming it 'great' news.

Twitter user Andrej Novak‏ wrote: '@Trevornoah didn't appear much on @TheDailyShow, but from what we could see, he looks like a great replacement. Show must go on.'

Meanwhile, a British man named Tim Browning tweeted Noah, asking him: 'Any truth to rumour about the daily show?' He added: 'Good luck. I think you would be a great addition!'

Appearance: In 2012, Noah became the first South African stand-up comedian to feature on NBC's The Tonight Show (pictured). In 2013, he became the first to appear on CBS's Late Show With David Letterman

Departure: Stewart's (pictured) departure was announced by Comedy Central President Michele Ganeless after the host broke the news to the studio audience at a taping in New York at the beginning of February

And a user called Sarah said she hoped 'so badly' that the comedian would be named the new host.

In addition to being the show's host, Stewart is currently also an executive producer. His firm, Busboy Productions, produces The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, which replaced The Colbert Report. 

It is unclear whether the short list includes former The Daily Show correspondent John Oliver, who moved over to HBO after successfully filling in for Stewart when he took a movie-making break.

Asked about whether Oliver is a candidate last month, Herzog's reply was succinct.

'John Oliver's got a job,' he said, later adding: 'I think he's spoken for.'

Another obvious candidate for the role - the veteran The Daily Show contributor Samantha Bee - has apparently been ruled out after accepting a deal to start a program at Time Warner's TBS.

Her husband, Jason Jones, is heading to TBS with her. And correspondent Jessica Williams has deemed herself 'extremely under-qualified' for Stewart's position, Entertainment Weekly reported.

Whoever is chosen as replacement on the program has heavy lifting to do. Stewart, who grew up in New York City, is expected to leave his role at some point between July and the end of the year.

'It's not easy. The shadow of Jon Stewart is going to loom large. What you have to get comfortable with is, it's just not going to be Jon Stewart. And it's going to be different,' Herzog told AP.

Still to be decided: The Daily Show contributors Samantha Bee and Jason Jones (left) have apparently been ruled out as possible replacements after accepting a deal to start a program at Time Warner's TBS. Right, TV executive Doug Herzog, 55, said whether Stewart will have a future role on the show is 'to be determined'

He added that, whatever happens, 'The Daily Show' is 'a format that's built to last, and last it will.'

Stewart's departure was announced by Comedy Central President Michele Ganeless after the host broke the news to the studio audience at a taping in New York at the beginning of February. 

'This show doesn't deserve an even slightly restless host, and neither do you,' Stewart told the audience, blinking back tears. 'I'm gonna have dinner, on a school night, with my family,' he added.

Ganeless called Stewart a 'comic genius.' But she did not say what led to his decision to leave.

The revelation sparked a huge reaction online, prompting Stewart, who has amassed 19 Emmys, to joke: 'Last night I was perusing the internet, and I guess my question to you is, "Did I die?"'
