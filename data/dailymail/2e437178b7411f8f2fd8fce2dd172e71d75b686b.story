A Cub Scout leader who alleged molested young boys has told police he is a ‘monster’, must be jailed and said it was a ‘mistake’ that he was born.

George Robert Fout, 25, of Ocala, Florida, told police he had molested several young boys, including one he had met through the Cub Scouts.

The computer repairman, facing child porn and sexual battery charges, allegedly said he had been looking at child porn since he was a child.

Fout allegedly attacked a Cub Scout when 
the boy was eight and he was 18, then continued around twice a month 
until the child became 16.

The child porn was allegedly found when police saw it had been downloaded to a computer in the Silver Springs Shores area of Ocala.

‘Detectives used various investigative techniques to learn that Fout was downloading and sharing child pornography,’ a sheriff’s spokesman said.

The graphic images involve boys aged seven, nine and 12 - but Fout told authorities he did not know the children in the videos, police said.

He is charged with capital sexual battery, lewd and lascivious molestation, sexual battery and 28 counts of child pornography possession.

Police now want to identify other possible victims of Fout, who is owner of Byte-by-Byte Computers.

According to his LinkedIn page, he is involved with the Scouts as a Computer Merit Badge teacher, reported the Ocala Star Banner.

Fout is being held on a $280,000 bond at the Marion County Jail and police said he has admitted raping the aforementioned Cub Scout.
