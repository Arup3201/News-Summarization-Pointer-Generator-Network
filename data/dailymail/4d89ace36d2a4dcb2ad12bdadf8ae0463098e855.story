A Florida mother is fighting for custody of her son - after he was taken into care by state officials who feared her vegan diet would harm the boy's health.

Sarah Markham of Orlando's baby was taken away from her at the age of 12 days in June after she refused to take her to hospital when he began to lose weight.

Instead, she told police that she wanted to feed her baby a vegan formula.

Faces criminal charges: Sarah Markham is fighting for custody of her son after he was taken away because she tried giving him vegan baby formula instead of following doctor's orders

Taken away: Markham wanted to giver baby a vegan formula instead of breast milk 

Caretaker or criminal?: Markham is only allowed to see her son during supervised visits and and only sees him a few times a week, according to Seminole County Child Protective Services

Markham was arrested in June when her son was less than two weeks old.

Now she's trying to win back her child and faces criminal child neglect charges.

WFTV reports that Markham's baby had lost 10 percent of his body weight and doctors told her to take the baby to the hospital.

She wanted to supply the baby with vegan formula instead of breast milk to see if would help the baby gain any weight.

Markham is a Christian Seventh-day Adventist and holistic healing is in her system of beliefs.

Because of her choice not to take her son to the hospital, Markham is only allowed to see her son during supervised visits and she can only see him a few times a week, according to Seminole County Child Protective Services.

'They've kept a child away from a mom,' said attorney Mark O'Mara to WFTV.

'My client can only see her child once a week or twice a week because they're requiring the child be out of the county,' he said.

O'Mara said that Markham's parenting was 'not even close' to child neglect.

'It's absurd. It's a mom trying to do the best she can, acting as a vegan which she has the entire right to do taking care of her child,' he said.

Markham’s son is now healthy and she is willing to do anything she can to get him back.

'She has done everything they've asked her to do: Mental health evaluations, drug evaluations, parenting classes, everything they've asked her to do she's done, and she's done it very well, and yet we have to go to trial on this tomorrow. It's absurd,' said O'Mara.
