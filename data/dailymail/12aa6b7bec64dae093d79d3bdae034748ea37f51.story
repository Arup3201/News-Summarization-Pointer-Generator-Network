A blind woman has spoken of her anger after an Uber taxi driver refused to pick her up apparently because she was with her guide dog.

Amy Dixon says she ordered a cab through the firm's app in her home town of Darien in Connecticut on Tuesday.

But when she went to open the door, she claims the driver sped off, leaving her and her dog Elvis stranded.

'Flabbergasted': Blind woman Amy Dixon claims an Uber taxi driver refused to pick her up because she was with her guide dog Elvis

She said: 'I was flabbergasted. I'm screaming at him, waving my arms like crazy thinking maybe he made a mistake because I was hoping it wasn't what I thought it was.'

But her fears were confirmed around ten seconds later when she received a text saying the driver had cancelled the pick up, it was reported by NBC New York.

Mrs Dixon, who lost her vision around seven years ago, managed to get another Uber car to take her home.

Uber said it had fired the driver.

'Built to expand transportation options for all': Uber said it had fired the driver after being told of the incident

In a statement, it said: 'The Uber app is built to expand access to transportation options for all, including users with visual impairments and other disabilities.

'It is Uber's policy that any driver partner that refuses to transport a service animal will be deactivated from the Uber platform, which has been done in this case.'

Mrs Dixon welcomed the response, but said all drivers needed to be educated about service dogs.

She added: 'As soon as they sign a contract to be an Uber driver, they have to obey the law, plain and simple.'

Uber is a ride-sharing service that allow users to request taxis through an app which are then dispatched to drivers. 

Uber drivers aren't employed by the company, but instead work on a freelance basis.
