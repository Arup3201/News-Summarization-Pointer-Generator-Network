Asda will offer offer its staff 'Nativity leave' this Christmas, giving parents extra time off to see their children perform in the school play.

The scheme will give workers the option to take unpaid leave outside of their normal allowances so that they don't miss out on vital family moments this festive season.

They will be allowed either to take the time off and forgo their pay, or swap shifts with other staff to make sure they have the crucial dates off.

Little angels: Parents will be able to take unpaid leave to see their children perform at school

The move was introduced following a survey of 5,500 mothers who shop at the supermarket found the school Nativity play is one of the events they feel they cannot afford to miss.

Hayley Tatum, Asda's executive people director, said: 'There's no doubt working mums have a lot on their plate at this time of year and we don't want our colleagues to miss out on the things that are really important to them this Christmas.

'Technology might help to take the pressure off busy working parents on a daily basis, but we know that it's just not the same watching your child's milestone moments back on a smartphone.

'"Nativity Leave" gives parents the opportunity to take time off for the school Christmas play or simply for some much needed family time outside of normal holidays.'

However, while the scheme was designed with parents desperate to see their child's star turn in mind, any staff members can take advantage of the scheme.

They will also be allowed the time off for Christmas shopping or seeing family, as they do not have to provide a specific reason for the time off.

From mums: Asda made the decision after feedback from its 5,500-strong 'Mumdex' panel

An Asda spokesman added that the store expects lots of its staff who are grandparents to capitalise on the offer to see their young family members as much as possible.

The latest report from the Asda 'Mumdex' panel also revealed that mums across the country will do their best to enforce a traditional Christmas experience this year.

More than a third of mums said they plan to ban gadgets such as smartphones and tablet computers from

The latest "Mumdex" research also revealed that traditional values are more important to mums this Christmas Day than technology with 35 per cent planning to totally ban technology from the Christmas dinner table this year.

The average family plans to spend an hour and 20 minutes playing board games on Christmas Day, compared with 25 minutes on social media.
