Abortions outnumber live births among African American women living in New York City, according to a new health report.

Newly released Department of Health and Mental Hygiene figures show black women had 31,328 'crude induced terminations' in 2012, compared with 24,758 'live births'.

The terminations comprised more than 42 percent of the Big Apple's total number.

Birth rate: The report found that the 2012 citywide crude birth rate was 14.8 births per 1,000 population, the lowest rate since 1979 when 
the rate was also 14.8

Changes: New York's abortion rate has fallen below 40 percent for the first time in at least a decade, according to the report

The second highest number of abortions were for Hispanic at 22,917, with this group's live births reaching 36,642.

Both groups outnumbered abortions for whites and Asian and Pacific Islanders, which had 9,704 and 4,493 terminations respectively.

Women aged 20-29 had the most abortions among all ethnicities, with more women in Brooklyn choosing to terminate rather than have a child.

The
 abortion ratio citywide fell to just over 37 per cent in 2012 - a record low 
since 1970 when abortion was legalized in New York.

Anti-abortion and religious groups have hit out at the figures, describing abortion as a 'problem' which the city is failing to adequately address.

In the interests of the fetus: Religious groups are unsurprisingly outraged at the report's abortion figures, believing that women don't have the right to make decisions about their own bodies
