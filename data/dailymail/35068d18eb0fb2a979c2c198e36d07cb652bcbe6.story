Older women are putting their lives at risk by failing to go for regular smear tests, cancer charities warned last night.

Latest figures show that the proportion of women screened for early signs of cervical cancer drops from the age of 55 – and around a quarter aged 50 to 64 skip the five-minute check.

These women are up to six times more likely to develop the disease than those who attend all their appointments, Cancer Research UK said yesterday.

It said regular smear tests were vitally important for older women – and urged them to attend all of their appointments.

In England, women can have smear tests on the NHS every three years between the ages of 25 and 49 and then every five years until 65.

Smear tests pick up cells in the cervix, or lining of the womb, that could become cancerous and are credited with saving up to 5,000 lives a year in the UK.

However, the proportion of women going for the checks falls from the age of 55.

Figures from the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) show that in 2013, some 82 per cent of women aged 50 to 54 had been recently tested.

This dropped to 76 per cent among 55 to 59-year-olds and to 73 per cent among 60 to 64-year-olds.

There is particular concern that rates of screening among 60 to 64-year-olds are at a 16-year-low. Yet the number of cases in this age group is at its highest for a decade.

With most cases of cervical cancer triggered by the sexually transmitted disease HPV, some older women may believe they are protected because they have been in a long-term relationship.

However, cervical cancer can still strike in old age and those in monogamous relationships may be at risk from HPV caught years earlier.

Although the bulk of the 3,000 cases a year occur in younger women, cervical cancer is more likely to be diagnosed at a later stage and to be deadly in older women.

The issue has been thrown into the spotlight by a study of all women aged 65 to 83 diagnosed with cervical cancer in England over a five-year period.

Researchers from Queen Mary University of London found that women who did not go for a smear in their 50s or 60s were four times as likely to develop cervical cancer as those who had regular checks, the journal PLOS Medicine reports.

And those who did not attend were six times more likely to be diagnosed with the disease than those who had three smear tests that produced negative results.

Researcher Peter Sasieni said: ‘Screening may not be pleasant but it is quick and relatively painless and often prevents an aggressive cancer later in life.’

He added that as cervical cancer takes a long time to develop, the protection offered by regular smear tests in later life can extend into a woman’s 80s.

This means that as the population ages, the NHS should consider extending the upper age limit for smear tests. He estimates that giving women one final smear test at the age of 70 could prevent up to 200 cases of cervical cancer and save 100 lives a year.

Jessica Kirby, of Cancer Research UK, which funded the study, said: ‘These results provide reassurance that there is a real benefit to women over 50 having cervical cancer screening.

‘Screening can pick up abnormal cells that could develop into cervical cancer if left alone. Removing these cells prevents cancer from developing.’

Robert Music, chief executive of Jo’s Cervical Cancer Trust, said: ‘Cervical cancer can be a slow-developing disease and you only need to be sexually active once in your lifetime to be at risk.’

There are around 1,000 deaths a year from cervical cancer.
