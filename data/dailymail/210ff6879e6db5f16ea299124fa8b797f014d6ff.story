One out of every five children rely on food stamps to stay fed, according to numbers released by the Census Bureau on Wednesday.

The agency released statistics on the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly referred to as food stamps, showing 16million children relied on SNAP in 2014, the most since 2008.

The program saw a sharp increase in registration at the outset of the recession—the 2007 Census found 7million children on the program—and has hovered at higher levels ever since.

The data shows that 8million children, half of those receiving SNAP benefits, lived with only their mother, while 5million lived with married parents.

Though the numbers are currently still high, participation and spending in the program appear to be declining, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

The agency announced this week that $76billion was spent on SNAP in 2014, down 8 percent from the previous year. 

Though SNAP has been a target of conservatives—concentrated cuts in 2014 trimmed $8.6billion over 10 years—more scrutiny is expected in the Republican-controlled Congress.

The new chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Representative Mike Conaway, told Politico he's already planning to review food stamps for the 2019 Farm Bill, the omnibus spending bill that covers food assistance along with various agriculture programs.

'We ought to do a soup-to-nuts review of the entire program,' he said in November. 'What works? What doesn’t work? Are there moral hazards baked into the system?'

Need: Though Republican lawmakers like Representative Mike Conaway say they are looking to review and overhaul the program, supporters say levels of fraud and waste are low

Spending: The Congressional Budget Office announced this week that spending was down 8 percent in the program compared to 2013

In spite of high levels of spending on the program, progressive think tank Center on Budget and Policy Priorities argues that few benefits go to those who don't need it.

'Fewer than 1 percent of SNAP benefits are issued to households that do not meet all of the program’s eligibility requirements,' the organization states in a policy report.

Food stamps spending cuts came about as a compromise between House Republicans and Senate Democrats in the 2014 Farm Bill, which also cut around $19billion in direct payments to farmers.

A significant amount of spending cuts, however, were offset by increases to government subsidies that covered deductibles farmers pay for crop insurance, according to the Washington Post.
