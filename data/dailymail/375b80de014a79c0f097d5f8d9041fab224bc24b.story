The father of three disabled children allegedly smothered in their pyjamas by their mother wept today as he watched his sobbing wife appear in court charged with murder.

Tania Clarence, 42, is accused of killing three-year-old twin sons, Ben and Max, and four-year-old daughter Olivia, who all suffered from a degenerative condition sometimes described as ‘floppy baby syndrome’.

The mother-of-four, who was rushed into court covered in a fluorescent jacket, broke down when she saw her husband Gary Clarence, 43, for the first time since the deaths of their children.

He flew home from his native South Africa yesterday after a holiday with their eldest daughter to celebrate her eighth birthday,  and was hugged by relatives as he
arrived in the public gallery.

The couple sat feet apart during the two-minute hearing where Mrs Clarence sobbed uncontrollably as she struggled to confirm her name, address and date of
birth to magistrates.

Mr Clarence blinked away tears and his hands shook as his wife was remanded in custody to appear at
the Old Bailey on May 9.

The investment banker, who flew in from his native South Africa with eldest daughter, eight, locked eyes with his sobbing wife as she entered the court for the short hearing.

The court heard how Clarence is charged with three counts of murder, victim one of age or older between April 20 and 23.

Chair of the bench Fiona Abbott said: 'For these three charged, you will be sent to the Central Criminal Court for a preliminary hearing on the May 9'.

Two uniformed police officers stood guard outside the courtroom and the public gallery was packed with press during the short hearing.

Mr Clarence was escorted out of the court by police officers and driven away in a black taxi.

He did not say anything as he walked down the court steps and through a scrum of photographers.A female police officer stopped traffic to allow Mr Clarence to be driven off quickly.

Meanwhile murder squad detectives have removed more evidence from the Clarence family home after spending the afternoon looking for clues.

Around 20 brown paper evidence bags were taken away from the scene in an unmarked police van just before four o'clock.

Mr Clarence was said to be in a ‘state of shock’, and the family’s lawyers in Cape Town yesterday released a statement which spoke of him suffering from ‘tremendous pressure and strain’.

It said: ‘The Clarence family have undergone and suffered an extreme tragedy with regard to their three minor children in the United Kingdom. This matter is an extremely exceptional one, with devastating consequences.’

The couple’s three youngest children suffered from the degenerative condition spinal muscular atrophy (SMA).

Mrs Clarence was said to be devoted to the children, giving up her career as a graphic designer to look after them.

The family had spent almost a year renovating their home in New Malden to make it suitable for their disabled children – fitting a lift and ramps.

Probe: Police forensic officers remove items from the home in south-west London where the children died

Police were called to the family's five-bedroom home in Thetford Road in the wealthy south west London suburb of New Malden at 9.30pm last Tuesday night where they discovered the bodies

A friend said that the three children had to be fed through tubes and their parents had to administer medicine hourly, which was understood to have put a huge amount of pressure on Mrs Clarence.

And while the couple employed a carer and home help, they did not have round-the-clock assistance.

Support: Businessman Kevin Clarence, Gary Clarence's brother, has accompanied him to London along with their mother and sister

The friend added: ‘Everything was regulated, everything they ate diarised. I bet Tania had not had a decent night’s sleep in a few years.

‘Gary is a businessman and had to travel. Tania has borne the brunt of it.

'Everybody who met her could not but be compassionate. Everybody complains about their kids but at least they’re healthy. It puts your life into perspective.’

Another friend said Mrs Clarence had complained that she found social services tended to be ‘judgmental’ when she asked for help.

Officials took the attitude she should ‘get on with it and pull herself together’, they said.

Friends of the family decided to alert the police on Tuesday after they were unable to contact the family for 24 hours.

The children were discovered in their pyjamas in bed and are believed to have been smothered to death.

Mr Clarence, 43, was seeing relatives in his native South Africa with his eldest child Taya Grace, eight – who is not affected by the illness – to celebrate her birthday when he heard about the devastating news.

They both flew to the UK today along with his mother Anne and sister Derri Phillips, who accompanied him for support.

Friends said he had been struggling to come to terms with what had happened.

A spokesman for the family told a South African newspaper: ‘Gary is absolutely in a state of shock – the whole family is.

‘He never would have left the UK if he’d known his wife would be left really battling.’

Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a disease sometimes called ‘floppy baby syndrome’ that affects between 5,500 and 6,000 people in the UK.

It causes muscle weakness and progressive loss of movement as the nerve cells connecting the brain and spinal cord to the body’s muscles break down over time.

Muscles used for activities such as crawling, walking, sitting up and moving the head become gradually weaker, but mental abilities remain unaffected.

In the most severe forms of SMA, types I and II, fatal respiratory problems often develop early on and it is the leading cause of genetic death in infants and toddlers.

Depending on its severity, children may need surgery, exercises and  equipment to improve mobility and breathing. There is no cure.

SMA is caused by a faulty copy of a gene, which is activated when both parents carry it.

Around one in every 40 to 60 people carry the gene. It can be tested for during pregnancy, although the test can increase the risk of a miscarriage.

Joanna Mitchell, from the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Trust, said: ‘There can be terrible pain and it can be challenging for parents to look after children with the condition.’

A forensics teams has spent several hours in the house and post mortem examinations will be carried out

Location: The children were found dead in a house in Thetford Road, New Malden, south-west London
