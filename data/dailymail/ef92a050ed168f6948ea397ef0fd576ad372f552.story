Newcastle have secured the future of Callum Roberts, the highly-rated teenager whose dribbling skills have been likened to Lionel Messi by club legend Peter Beardsley.

The 17-year-old has agreed terms on his first professional deal, which will be announced this week.

Roberts is currently on loan at Conference side Gateshead but is still eligible for Newcastle Under-21 and youth-team fixtures.

The forward – who made his senior debut in the FA Cup defeat at Leicester earlier this month – starred as United beat Middlesbrough in the FA Youth Cup a fortnight ago and will feature in the fifth-round clash with North-East rivals Sunderland.

Roberts has won praise from Under-21 boss Beardsley having broken onto the scene in eye-catching fashion this season.

The former England frontman said: ‘Callum has been the one so far (to stand out this season).

‘He is a year younger than most of them but has been outstanding whenever he has played this season.

‘He is probably the next one in the manager’s thoughts and has been the real pick of the bunch.

‘Quite simply, his ability makes him stand out. He loves a dribble and is quite old-fashioned in that respect.

‘You also look at players like Messi and Ronaldo and they are both great dribblers and Callum is of that ilk.’
