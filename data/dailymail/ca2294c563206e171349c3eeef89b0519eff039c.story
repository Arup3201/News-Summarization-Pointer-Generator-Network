Sentenced: Devon Jenkins, 16, has been sentenced to probation and community service after acting as a lookout while his friend's grandmother was killed last year

A 16-year-old boy who acted as a lookout while his friend's grandmother was ambushed, strangled and stabbed in her Minnesota home was today sentenced to probation and community service.

Devon James Jenkins must complete a 
youth correctional program, perform 100 hours of community service and 
serve probation until age 21 over the murder of 79-year-old Lila Warwick.

'I go to bed every night thinking about the awful things I did,' Jenkins told Kandiyohi County Court about the July 2013 incident.

Jenkins, who had smoked marijuana on the night of the murder, told the court he's been in chemical dependency treatment since October and wants to get his high school diploma, work with his dad in the drywall business and go to Ridgewater College to get his general classes, according to The Global Dispatch.

As Jenkins apologized in court for his actions, Warwick's daughter Cheri Ekbom said she did not hate her mother's attackers. She did not comment on the sentence.

'Maybe it seemed like such an innocent thing to get in that car that night,' she said, according to Star Tribune.

'As a result of that choice, the life of a human being - my mother - was violently taken from us. It will also cost you five years of your life.

'To hate you would bring dishonor to my mom and only allow the darkness...to continue.'

Jenkins was the youngest of three defendants charged over Warwick's tragic death.

Prosecutors said the church volunteer's own grandson, 18-year-old Robert Warwick, masterminded the deadly plan that led 19-year-old Brok Junkermeier to choke and stab the woman.

Junkermeier was charged with intentional second-degree murder, without premeditation, and his trial is in March. Warwick's trial has not been scheduled.

According to the charging documents, Warwick believed that his grandmother had more than $40,000 in a safe.

The trio had reportedly been planning to kill Warwick and steal her money for some time.

Warwick's body was found after she 
failed to show up at a meeting at Redeemer Lutheran Church, where she 
was a volunteer.

‘Upon 
entering into the garage and home, deputies found evidence of homicidal 
violence and found the body of Ms. Warwick who was deceased,’ one of the
 juvenile petitions said.

Preliminary autopsy results showed she died from complex homicidal violence involving multiple stab wounds and strangulation.

After the murder, witnesses told authorities they heard Junkermeier talk previously about killing Warwick and stealing her money, but both thought he was joking.

One of the witnesses said that the day after the killing, Junkermeier came to him and talked about the burglary and attack.

According to the charges, Junkermeier told his friend that he and another teen drove to Warwick's house in the 3000 block of U.S. Highway 12 East at around 4am on July 29 and lay in ambush.

The 19-year-old had previously obtained a key to get into Warwick's garage, and went inside wearing a mask and gloves while Jenkins stayed in the car as a lookout.

Junkermeier waited two hours for Warwick to enter the garage, then ambushed her and slashed her hand with a 20-inch knife.

The suspect told his friend that while the elderly woman was bleeding heavily, he forced her to access her bank account online and write him a check for $1,500.

Prosecutors say Junkermeier later deposited that money into his account.

Junkermeier told his confidant he then began to strangle Warwick, and when he saw she was not dead, he stabbed her multiple times before dumping her in the basement, the charges said.

The charges state that soon after Warwick’s gristly murder, Junkermeier and Jenkins went to a nearby McDonald’s for a snack and then headed home, The Minneapolis Star Tribune reported.

At around 2pm that day, Junkermeier and Robert Warwick returned to Lila Warwick's house and took a safe.

The duo stopped by the house again at around 5pm and saw police officers on the scene.

The charges said Junkermeier confessed to the killing when he was arrested and told police where to find the bloody knife.

Bloody gym shoes, a safe and 30 $1,000 savings bonds in Warwick's name were found at Junkermeier's house, the complaint said.

At the time of the incident, Cheri Ekbom said her nephew was a drug addict who hated his grandmother and wanted her dead.

Junkermeier, a 2012 graduate of Willmar High School, has had some previous run-ins with the law involving theft-related charges and was on probation at the time of Warwick's death.

Former classmates described Junkermeier to Echo Press as a big sports enthusiast who did not have many friends in school and was often picked on.

Graham Dahl, 19, called Junkermeier a stone-faced 'weird kid' who had little respect for his teachers and would sometimes get ejected from class for acting out.

Warwick had eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. She and her husband, who died in 1976, had lived in Willmar since 1969.
