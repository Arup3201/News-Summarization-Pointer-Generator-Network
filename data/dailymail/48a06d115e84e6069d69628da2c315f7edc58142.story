Facing question: Sir Hugh Orde, president of the 
Association of Chief Police Officers, which allegedly hushed up the
 arrest of its own chief executive

Britain's most powerful policing organisation was accused last night of hushing up the arrest of its chief executive.

Tom Flaherty, 54, was detained by Scotland Yard detectives after an extraordinary row at the Association of Chief Police Officers.

The civilian employee was accused of stealing the desk diary of association president Sir Hugh Orde from his Whitehall office.

Even though the matter was dropped Flaherty remains suspended on full pay and could still be sacked for misconduct.

Last night the secretive police body faced questions as to why it did not come clean over the allegations.

‘It is absolutely extraordinary that some of the most senior police officers in the land can possibly think it is appropriate to suppress this information,’ said Mark Reckless, a Conservative MP.

‘If working relations at the highest level of Acpo have broken down to this extent I cannot see why the taxpayer should be spending large sums keeping them employed.

‘If they are going to be involved in operational policing, both locally and nationally, they should be subject to appropriate democratic controls.’

The row could not come at a worse time for senior Acpo members, who are fighting for the existence of an organisation that has pushed for more secrecy around police activities and advised forces against naming people it arrests.

Its Home Office funding ended last December and many police authorities refused to pay their final fees, leaving it £250,000 out of pocket.

Earlier this week police and crime commissioners announced retired military chief Sir Nick Parker will examine whether it is ‘fit for purpose’.

Mr Flaherty, a Metropolitan Police Service employee, was seconded to Acpo in 2006 where he was made chief executive and company secretary on up to £112,604 a year. He came from a role in specialist operations, which is responsible for counter terrorism and VIP protection.

It is understood he was accused of stealing Sir Hugh’s desk diary, which contained appointments and contacts, in a deliberate act of sabotage.

Mr Flaherty was questioned by detectives but the case was dropped without prosecutors being consulted. It is not known whether the diary was recovered. Mr Flaherty has been replaced by Ian Readhead from the Hampshire force.

An Acpo spokesman said: ‘Tom Flaherty’s secondment to Acpo from the Metropolitan Police has ended and he has returned to his force following an allegation of misconduct.

‘This is a normal procedure to allow a disciplinary process to take place.’

The case shines a rare light on the 
divisions and infighting within Acpo against the background of its 
opaque structure, lucrative commercial interests and status as a private
 firm.

It co-ordinates the 
sale of information from the police national computer at vast profit and
 markets ‘police approval logos’ for sale on anti-theft devices. But its
 central role in the police structure also enables it to write the rules
 on how operations are carried out as well as campaigning on key issues.

Led
 by retired Police Service of Northern Ireland chief Sir Hugh, who earns
 £188,736, it has employed many retired chief officers, often on 
short-term contracts.

One of
 its leading members, British Transport Police chief Andy Trotter, led 
campaigning for more secrecy around police activities.

The most recent documents available at Companies House show Acpo employs 22 staff and has a wage bill of £1.7million.

It registered assets worth £5million, including £3.5million in cash, and received a total income of £5.8million, including a £1million Home Office grant.

In an unusual move, staff applied for a special exemption to remove the designation ‘Ltd’ from Acpo’s title earlier this year.

Sir Hugh has pledged to reform the organisation, admitting its status as a private firm is awkward. His critics say little progress has been made.
