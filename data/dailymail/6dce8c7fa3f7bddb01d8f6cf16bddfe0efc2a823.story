This is the unassuming California pad where Elvis Presley would secretly wine and dine women away from the prying eyes of the media and jealous fans.

The hideout, which was largely unknown while The King was alive, is tucked away in Palm Springs, two hours' drive from Los Angeles.

It was photographed by a Hollywood insider in the late 1960s, who kept the pictures away from the public eye until now.

Memorabilia: Elvis coated the walls of the property in posters for his films - and the occasional cut-out

Although the property, just miles from his famed Honeymoon House, is humble in comparison to his more lavish residence, the photographs still show touches of Elvis's trademark style.

One bedroom features a huge double bed with black silk sheets, with a second decorated in garish pink.

In a light-hearted gesture, the singer had also placed cardboard cut-out of himself behind the home's well-stocked bar.

The residence was so secluded that Elvis reportedly felt safe enough to sunbathe nude by the pool.

The walls were adorned with personal photos of the with his wife Priscilla and daughter Lisa Marie, along with gold discs and film posters.

Outside, the pool stood in the shadow of Mount Jacinto - and had chairs with the names of Elvis and his manager Tom 'the Colonel' Parker on the back.

Photographs of the home were taken by gossip reporter Roger Asquith, a journalist who sold Hollywood stories to UK publications for 40 years.

Speaking for the first time about the pictures, Roger, 82, said: 'It wasn't a film star's mansion, but it wasn't supposed to be.

'It was just a little love nest for him to go there and stay for weekends and stay out of everyone's way.

'Nobody knew it was there and these pictures have never been printed.'

As well as interviewing the stars, Mr Asquith had property interests and had a friend who helped manage the home for Mr Presley.

She was sent over to check the house on one occasion before Elvis visited and Mr Asquith joined her to look around.

Speaking from his home in Gloucester, he said: 'It was just a little two-bedroom place with a kidney-shaped pool.

Wall of rock: The house contained this display of 15 gold discs, awarded for his smash-hit songs

Sense of humour: Elvis had decorated this bar inside the house with a cardboard cut-out of himself

'It was just a very nice house, very comfortable and ideal for him to take girls with him.

'It was in an immaculate condition so I just took a few photographs and left.' 

Mr Asquith said the palm tree-fronted house was chosen by Elvis because the secluded pool meant he could sunbathe with his guests away from prying eyes.

The guest room was reportedly used by former child star Natalie Wood, rumoured to have had a relationship with the singer in the 1950s before he married Priscilla.

The room had a TV, en-suite bathroom and a picture of Elvis playing guitar.

Elsewhere in the house 15 gold discs hang on the wall alongside framed newspaper cuttings, posters for his 1957 film Loving You and his movie from the following year, King Creole. 

It is understood the home is now a private residence.
