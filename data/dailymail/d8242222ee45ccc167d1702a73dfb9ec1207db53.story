Islamic State militants are employing identical torture methods used by the Syrian government they have vowed to overthrow.

Prisons taken over by the Islamic extremists are now doling out the same brutal practices on their victims, which Assad's forces used to punish rebels like them for decades.

Victims of ISIS claim they are now using well-known punishments like 'the tyre', the 'flying carpet' and the 'German chair'. 

Activists in Raqqa revealed how they were tortured using a method known as the 'shabeh', which roughly translates to  'ghost' in Arabic. 

It involves tying the victims' arms behind their backs using handcuffs - which are then used to hoist the body into the air, putting extreme pressure on the shoulder sockets.

Hazm al-Hussein, who was tortured by an Islamic State leader once imprisoned by the regime, said: 'All you think about is the pain.

Invasion: Islamic State have near-total control over the city of Raqqa (pictured), where those trying to relay images of their suffering to the outside world, are arrested and tortured

Enemy: It's thought Islamic State are copying the torture methods used by President Bashar al-Assad's (pictured) regime - who they've vowed to overthrow 

Execution: Earlier this week, Islamic State threw a man off a building after accusing him of homosexuality 

'You can't think about anything else. You just have to be patient. If you get angry, they will just take your head off. You know they want to do it.'

Jimmy Shahinan was given the 'shabeh' every four days for four months until his arms dislodged from their sockets. 

The ghost: The hands are tied behind their back with handcuffs, which are then used to suspend their bodies in the air.

The German chair: Victims are strapped to a chair whose back is adjusted abruptly at will to cause extreme spinal damage.

The flying carpet: Victims are strapped down to a hinged board. The ends are then brought towards each other to bend the spine.

The tyre: Victims are placed inside a large tyre - rendering them immobile - before they're mercilessly beaten

According to Richard Spencer, reporting for the Telegraph in Gaziantep, it took four months for the feeling in his hands to return. 

The repercussions of the same torture still haunt a man simply known as 'Samir'.

He twitches uncontrollably as a result, and hopes to obtain a visa so he can travel to the West for medical treatment.

In Raqqa and elsewhere, Amnesty has claimed that torture in Islamic State prisons is reaching 'chilling levels'.

Mr Shahinan was also punished with the 'German chair', where his body was strapped to a chair, whose back was adjusted at will to inflict extreme pain on the spine.

He said: 'They hanged me upside down in an upturned chair.

'They came and did this every day for four days. This is a traditional way to torture people in Syria. They leave you there hanging for anything from two to 12 hours.'

Amnesty International reports suggest the 'shabeh' has been carried out in the country for years, if not decades. 

Earlier this year, Islamic State fanatics left another man, Hazm-al-Hussein, hanging from his wrists for three days.

Two years prior, the same man was arrested by the Syrian government who tortured him using a method called 'the tyre'. He was put inside the rim of a large tyre, rendering him immobile, before he was physically beaten. 

Torture: Both Islamic State militants and Assad's regime are accused of using methods of punishment known as 'the ghost', the 'German chair' and 'the tyre'

Regime cruelty: A police photographer who defected from Assad's regime, earlier this year revealed graphic evidence 55,000 deaths in state-run prison cells since the start of the uprising.

 Inhumane: Amnesty international claim that torture in Islamic State prisons has reached 'chilling levels'

The cruelty of Syrian prisons has been well documented for years - long before the revolution inspired by the so-called Arab Spring. Now, Samir claims they have made 'an art for out of torture.  

In another known as the "flying carpet", victims are strapped down to a board, and the ends brought towards each other to beind their spines.
