Petty: Anthony Gulledge, 30, beat the boy when he came home Saturday and found his cheesecake missing

A 3-year-old boy is in critical condition today after his mom's boyfriend beat him over a piece of cheesecake. 

Anthony Gulledge, 30, has been arrested by Memphis, Tennessee police and charged with aggravated child abuse, neglect and domestic assault.  

According to the boy's mother, Gulledge came home Saturday night and found the cheesecake missing from the refrigerator. 

He proceeded to drag the boy out of his bedroom by the ankles and whip him until the toddler broke a femur bone in his leg and dislocated vertebrae. 

The mother says Gulledge beat her boy twice that night, and that she called police to report him the next day. 

There were bruises all over the boy's body when he was admitted to LeBonheur Children's Hospital on Sunday. 

Gulledge denies beating the child. 

He remains held in Shelby County Jail on $210,000 bond while the boy continues to recover at Le Bonheur Children's Hospital.
