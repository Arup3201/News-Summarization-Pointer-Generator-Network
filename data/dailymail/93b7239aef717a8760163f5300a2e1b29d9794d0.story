A photo of President Barack Obama was mistakenly used by a Fox news affiliate to represent a suspect in a college sexual assault case.

The photo of the president appeared on KSWB when anchor Kathleen Bade said 'The only suspect in a sex assault at SDSU (San Diego State University) will not be charged.'

KSWB soon cut to footage of a different man with authorities, as Bade announced 'The District Attorney's Office says they decided not to file charges against 20-year-old Francisco Sousa because the evidence against him is weak.' 

Mistake: A photo of President Obama popped up during a report on a sexual assault suspect 

According to the Times of San Diego, the photo of Obama - which had the words 'NO CHARGES' underneath it - was shown Friday at 10:04pm.

The Times of San Diego was the first to report on KSWB's error.

In an interview with the newspaper, KSWB assignment editor Mike Wille said the image was up for approximately 5 seconds and instantly spotted.

Wille told the Times of San Diego 'Yeah, there was an accident when they had an over-the-shoulder. It wasn't on purpose.'

The assignment editor also said he did not know what time Bade learned about the Obama photo.

He told the Times of San Diego 'They really don't do that when it's a small thing like that' in response to a question from the newspaper over a potential live acknowledgement or apology.

No one phoned KSWB in the middle of Friday's 10pm news regarding the photo, Wille told the news outlet.  

KSWB did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Daily Mail Online. 

Error: An assignment editor with KSWB has said the image was up for approximately 5 minutes and instantly spotted
