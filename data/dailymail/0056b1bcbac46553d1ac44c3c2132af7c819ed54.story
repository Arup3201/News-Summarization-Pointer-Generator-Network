Henrik Larsson has shown little to suggest he is the man to manage Celtic. Little to indicate he might be the new Jose Mourinho. 

Three years at modest Swedish second flight club Landskrona ended tamely with a mutual parting of the ways.

At Falkenberg, his latest gig, the first ten games of the season have brought three wins, two draws and five defeats. Currently 11th in a league of 16 teams this is a team battling for survival, not trophies.

In with a shout: Henrik Larsson could be the next Celtic boss but lacks coaching experience

Legend: Larsson enjoyed a seven-year career at Celtic and won the league title four times

Time to move on: Neil Lennon left Celtic earlier in the week

Larsson, then, has no real coaching record to speak of. Nothing which screams he is the man to lead Celtic to the last 16 of the Champions League.  

But the appeal to Dermot Desmond and the Celtic board is obvious.

Larsson is box office, a marquee name. He wants the job desperately. Bluntly, he would put bums on seats.  

How many of the names on a lengthy list of runners and riders would immediately do that? Jackie McNamara and Malky Mackay probably wouldn’t.

Owen Coyle is a sound, solid candidate - a lifelong Celtic fan with just one blip on his CV from Bolton Wanderers and a less than sparkling spell at Wigan. But if Coyle is appointed the Scottish champions won’t be selling season tickets. They will be pulping them.

Temptation: Celtic majority shareholder Dermot Desmond knows the appeal of hiring Larsson to replace Lennon

From the perspective of a board of directors wrestling with growing apathy and boredom in the stands, then, Larsson holds obvious appeal.

Celtic need an adrenalin shot. Someone to rally the fans and stimulate interest.

That Larsson would be a commercial rather than football decision is beyond dispute.

People have also described it as an instance of the heart ruling the head. But that’s not quite right.   Because what can be more calculating or planned than choosing a manager more suited to selling season tickets than winning trophies?

It’s possible, of course, that Larsson could be an outstanding success on both fronts.

BOIS Landskrona was his first gig. Travelling to meet the great man in the Swedish outpost in April 2010 the pitch was brown and bare, the stands the type you’d find at a municipal athletics stadium.

Money was scarce and, for a man who played for three of Europe’s biggest clubs, Celtic offer a far more appealing canvas to paint on.

With the current squad of players, Larsson is just as likely to win the Scottish Premiership by 20 points as a Malky Mackay or a Paul Lambert.

But the problem is this. If Celtic’s only priority is selling tickets they could appoint Billy Connolly. Or Kevin Bridges.

What they actually need is the best man to take them back to the Champions League.

That’s where the real money is to be found. That’s what sustains this club now. It’s how they define themselves. And whoever they appoint as the next manager has to be able to deliver.

Neil Lennon showed that an inexperienced manager can do it. But only after a nine-game trial. This time around Celtic don’t have that luxury.

Baptism of fire: Lennon was inexperienced as a manager when he took over at Celtic

Like the Northern Irishman, Larsson knows plenty about life at Parkhead. He spent seven years at the club scoring 242 goals in 315 appearances. He has been fully briefed on why Lennon left and, despite telling his current club he will stay put, wants the job.

It could be argued that Celtic’s Champions League qualification hopes would be better with Larsson in the dug-out and 60,000 in the top deck than they would be with Owen Coyle in there and a crowd of 42,000.

The Celtic board are entitled to go for someone who will invigorate the place. Someone who will stir the senses.

But it’s not Larsson, the iconic player, they would be getting. It’s Larsson the manager. And he no longer scores goals.

In private Larsson can be a warm and funny man. Far more so than his public image suggests. But there are aspects of managing Celtic which would grate hugely.

Goal machine: Larsson scored 242 times for Celtic during his career at the club

The incessant media demands. The inevitable intrusion into his private life. Even signing autographs – a practice he was prone to avoiding as a player by having his car moved to a sidedoor.

Like Lennon he has a strong, determined mind of his own. He’s not the type to be controlled or told who he is signing. He might buy into Celtic’s ‘model’ of buying young players and selling big 100 per cent. He would have to be.

But there is an unmistakable irony here and it’s this.  

Had Henrik Larsson been a Celtic player now he would have hung around one, maybe two seasons, then he would have been sold. He would never have become the Magnificent Seven of yore.  

This is what a Celtic manager must deal with these days while delivering Champions League football. Is Henrik Larsson up to it? Right now there isn’t a scrap of evidence to suggest that he is.

Would be a popular appointment with fans and put bums on seats

However, Larsson has no real coaching pedigree and a lack of experience of managing in the Champions League
