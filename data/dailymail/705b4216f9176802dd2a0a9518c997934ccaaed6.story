Manchester United have moved a step closer to securing David de Gea on a new contract on the very day they confirmed the arrival of his new No 2 Victor Valdes.

United have handed Valdes an 18-month deal with the option of an extra year's extension and Old Trafford manager Louis van Gaal confirmed that the 32-year-old will slot in as the club's No 2 goalkeeper.

However, it is the future of De Gea that is concerning many fans and it is understood that United are now confident of agreeing a lucrative new deal with the 24-year-old very soon.

Sportsmail recently reported that United and De Gea's agent Jorge Mendes wanted to conclude a deal quickly and sources at the club have now confirmed that the matter is moving rapidly in the right direction.

De Gea is now recognised as one of the best goalkeepers in the game and only has 18 months left on his contract at United.

Indeed his compatriot Valdes suggested on signing his own deal that De Gea now has no peers in world football.

Valdes, speaking to MUTV, said: 'I think now, at the moment, he is the best goalkeeper in the world.

'His performance every day and in every game shows everybody that his level is very high. He has had a great year and it is very nice. Now I think he is the best goalkeeper in the world.'

On the anticipated rivalry, Valdes added: 'I am here to help everybody. Always in my career, I have played to help my team-mates, to help my coach and to help everybody. I am a part of the team and I am not a problem, I am just a part of the team.'
