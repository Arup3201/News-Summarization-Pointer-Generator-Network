Cristiano Ronaldo was sporting yet another new haircut in Portugal's training ahead of their do-or-die match against Ghana on Thursday - days after his zig-zag style went viral.

The 29-year-old got rid of the cut that swept across the internet and, instead, now boasts a mop do.

The Real Madrid maestro's earlier cut was thought to be a tribute to 10-month-old Erik Ortiz Cruz, who had £50,000 brain surgery paid for by Ronaldo.

Ronaldo won't be too concerned with his hair come Thursday, though, as Portugal bid to save their World Cup status.

Not only must Ronaldo inspire his side to a win, he must do so emphatically against Ghana, as Portugal sit bottom of Group G with just one point.

That comes after Portugal lost 4-1 to Germany and drew 2-2 with USA, with Ronaldo yet to come to life as his counterparts Lionel Messi and Neymar have for Argentina and Brazil respectively.
