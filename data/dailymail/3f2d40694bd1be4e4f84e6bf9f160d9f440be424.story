Few teenagers could call on the help and advice of an England regular and Premier League winner when they were flung on the non-League scrapheap.

But when Bournemouth midfielder Harry Arter found himself released from then top-flight Charlton at 19-years-old and suddenly stranded in the Conference South at Woking, he had a familiar name to turn to.

Words of wisdom from brother-in-law Scott Parker, ignored early in his career, pulled Arter from the depths of non-League football oblivion.

The 25-year-old is now on the verge of playing in the Premier League, with Bournemouth top of the Championship, and will test his early potential against top-flight opposition Aston Villa in the FA Cup fourth round on Sunday.

'One regret I have is not taking on board what Scott said when I was a 16 and 17-year-old boy,' Arter admits. 'He warned me of situations that happened and I didn't listen.

'You get put on a pedestal at a young age when you're viewed as a promising player. Scott had seen that for years and years.

'I was just a 16-year-old boy who thought he was a Premier League player. And I was nowhere near a Premier League player.

'There were certain egos at Charlton, if young lads get in with the wrong crowd and look up to the wrong sort of player inevitably they're going to have a bad period for a while and that's what happened to me.

'I was probably looking up to players that at Charlton at that time thought they were better than they were. Scott had tried to warn me, but for whatever reason, probably immaturity, I didn't listen to him.'

Parker, so revered by his critics he was awarded the Football Writers' Association Player of the Year in 2011 and won the Premier League and League Cup double with Chelsea in 2005, is married to Arter's sister Carly.

The pair met when Parker was just 15 and staying at the Football Association's School of Excellence at Lilleshall. Introduced by a mutual friend, they have been together ever since and have four children.

Arter was only six-years-old at the time they met. None of the family knew that Parker would go on to win 18 England caps, captain his country and play in a European Championships.

He grew to become the perfect example – clean-cut, respected and hard-working – to a young Arter, himself yearning to become a professional footballer.

But when Arter debuted for Charlton in a League Cup against Luton Town in 2006, he shunned Parker's help. That would be his only game for the south-east London club and after two years, and loan spells at Staines Town and Welling United, his contract came to an end. No-one in the Football League would take him and his career was unravelling.

'When I got to 19 and signed for Woking Scott really came into my life football-wise,' Arter explains. 'He helped keep me motivated and try to stay as professional as I could.

'It was probably more me opening up to him and realising I'm in a bad position and there's someone in my family who deep down I know I should've listened to but I chose not to.

'Eventually once I started taking on his advice I tried to live my life similar to the way he lives his. I feel my career changed and I became more level-headed. I'm sure he gets a lot of satisfaction out of my success.'

Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has been equally as important in his progression. Howe watched just 50 minutes of Arter play in a match for Woking and saw enough to bring him to his side just promoted to League One in 2010.

Howe left for Burnley six months later and Arter struggled with different managers, but has since flourished since Howe returned in 2012.

'I was seen as No 1 hate figure round here for a year or so,' he adds. 'The fans didn't like me.

'Eventually I turned it around and a lot of that was because Eddie played me every week and liked me as a player.

'Eddie Howe could play a man with one leg and the fans would think it was all right, they love Eddie. Whatever he says is right with the fans, which is lucky for me.'
