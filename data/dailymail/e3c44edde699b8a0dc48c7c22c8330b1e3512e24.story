Following a successful meeting between Tony Abbott and Barack Obama at the White House yesterday, the prime minister has recanted the negative opinion he expressed of the president a few years ago, instead describing Mr Obama as 'charismatic' and 'inspirational'.

Mr Abbott, who is currently in the U.S. meeting with various leaders, previously described Mr Obama as leading one of the most left-wing US administrations in 50 years.

'Look, it was a bit of ill-judged commentary which I hope I've grown beyond,' he said of the remark.

He denied there was any conflict between the pair and said he now sees Mr Obama as 'a charismatic and at times inspirational president'.

'Sure, lots of people will have lots of disagreements because we live in a party-political system,' he said.

'But this is a person who did not get to be the president of the United States readily. He got there because he is a man of very considerable leadership abilities.'

Mr Obama seemed to return the high opinion, saying after the meeting that Australia was one of the U.S.'s closest allies, and a valued military partner.

Mr Abbott previously expressed doubt about Mr Obama's leadership, saying he led one of the most left-wing U.S. administrations in the last 50 years

'Aussies know how to fight, and I like having them in a foxhole if we're in trouble,' said Mr Obama.

'There are a handful of countries in the world that we always know we can count on, not just because they share our values, but we know we can count on them because they've got real capacity,' he said.

'Australia is one of those countries. We share foundational values about liberal democracies and human rights, and a world view that's governed by international law and norms.

'So I can't think of a better partner.'

The remarks came as it seems likely that the U.S. will intervene in Iraq once more as the crisis in the country has escalated, with insurgents storming Baghdad.

The pair discussed defence, China, and climate change - an issue on which they disagree

The hour-long meeting was also attended by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Vice President Joe Biden, ambassador Kim Beazley and Mr Abbott's chief of staff Peta Credlin

The president seemed to indicate his willingness to deploy more troops, saying: 'What we've seen over the last couple of days indicates the degree to which Iraq is going to need more help.'

Mr Abbott reassured his U.S. counterpart of Australia's willingness to do its part to 'secure the freedom and the safety of the world and its citizens'.

'I want to assure the president that Australia will be an utterly dependable ally of the United States. The United States has had to bear many burdens, many burdens.

'The United States has paid a very high price to secure freedom and prosperity for many countries, not just itself. And the United States should never have to do all that work on its own.'

President Obama also commended Tony Abbott for increasing Australia's defence budget in 'tough times' and the pair discussed commercial ties and their commitment to the trans-Pacific Partnership.

Mr Abbott met with the president this morning, also present in the meeting were the Australian ambassador to the U.S. Kim Beazley and the PM's chief of staff Peta Credlin, as well as Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State John Kerry.

He presented the president with the gift of a nine-foot custom-built surfboard, emblazoned with the Seal of the President and Australian and U.S. flags, and a pair of R.M. Williams boots.
