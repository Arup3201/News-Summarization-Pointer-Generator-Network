Many came here with little more than the clothes on their back and a tragic story to tell. - all were seeking a new life. 

Now archived police files have revealed exactly how the immigrants who settled in the UK between 1850 and 1960 were viewed by the authorities - including some of the colourful language officers used to describe them.

Archivists have spent seven months cataloguing almost 3,000 'alien registration cards' in Leeds, West Yorkshire, which are now open to the public.

Archivists have spent months cataloguing almost 3,000 'alien registration cards' from police in Leeds, West Yorkshire. They include the tragic tale of Hermann Anspacher, a retired horse dealer from Achim, Germany, whose family was killed by Nazis

Russian couple Anthony and Ophelia Yezavitovitch, who changed their name to Thompson and settled in Hyde Park, Leeds. Their son went on to become a scientist involved in atomic tests

Rifka Yafe, who changed her name to Rebecca, a Turkish immigrant who came to the UK in 1936 with husband Arran. She was granted citizenship in 1967

Before the days of immigration officials, those seeking refuge here were expected to register with their local police station.

Immigrants had to apply for permission to take employment or to take part in fire watching duties - even for permission to ride a bicycle.

The files released today are from archives kept by Leeds Police.

They include the tragic tale of Hermann Anspacher, a retired horse dealer from Achim, Germany.

His records show that his wife Frederika and 16-year-old daughter, Rosa Maria, were captured and killed by the Nazis. 

Lidija Zaikous, a divorced Latvian teacher. She came to the UK in 1952, with husband Voldemans Adrejo Zaikovs. She left the country in 1954, and no further notes were kept

Russian housekeeper Dina Adleman arrived in the UK in 1885, from Crozi, Russia. Before the days of immigration officials, those seeking refuge here were expected to register with their local police station

Italian widow Anna Zuccarini came to the UK in 1953. Her notes - registered at Leeds - show that she was born in Pianella, and was registered here as a visitor

Left with no other option Anspacher 
escaped his home country and arrived in Yorkshire in 1946 seeking a new 
life. It is not known when he died, as he was granted naturalisation - 
citizenship - in the 1950s, and police were no longer required to 
monitor him.

Russian couple Anthony and Ophelia Yezavitovitch arrived in the UK in 1912 and quickly embraced the British way of life.

They changed their name to Thompson, and settled in Hyde Park, Leeds.

Mr Yezavitovitch joined the British 
army between 1916-1919 and their son Edward became a well regarded  
scientist, who was later involved in atomic experiments in Australia.

When World War One broke out all 'aliens' over 16 were required to register at local police stations.

They were expected to 'demonstrate a good character and knowledge of English', a requirement fueled by the fear that spies were settling in the country. 

More than 32,000 alien men were interned during World War One, and some 28,744 aliens were repatriated at the outbreak of war, of these 23,571 were Germans.

Many refugees came to Britain from the German-occupied countries, especially Belgium and France.

Local committees were established to look after them.

Immigrants
had to apply for permission to take employment or to take part in fire 
watching duties - even for permission to ride a bicycle.

Many changed their names.

Schneider, became Taylor, Zabit became Stewart, Kroll became King, Yezavitovitch became Thompson and Gruber became Baker

The files all give a moving insight into the persecution those seeking a better life in England had escaped.

Pages
reveal that thriving family businesses, and valuable land and property 
were confiscated by the Russian and German armies, rendering people 
homeless and destitute.

Families
were divided as men and women were taken as forced labour for work in 
fields, farms and forests. Some were forced into divorce by the Russians
and Germans as they were deemed ‘unsuitably matched’.

Others reveal colourful language used
by English officers to describe the immigrants - including one referred
to as a 'dim-witted peasant', another a 'self-opinionated Jew' and an 
'unintelligent type.'

Archivist David Morris said: 'This collection is amazing and quite unique.

'Cards like this normally have a shelf-life and are then destroyed once the person becomes a naturalised citizen.

'They
contain the names, ages, occupations and other details of people from 
many different countries, including Germany, Romania, Poland, Russia, 
Italy, France, Yugoslavia and America.

'They cover quite a time span. The ones now in the public domain are of people born over 100 years ago.

'The ones we have kept back are people who could potentially still be alive.

'Some of the stories are uplifting because the person has hidden away from the authorities and made it out, though sadly on their own.'

The
files showed that many families felt the need to change their names 
from their birth names to ones they considered more acceptable or easier
to pronounce or spell. 

Schneider, became Taylor, Zabit became Stewart, Kroll became King, Yezavitovitch became Thompson and Gruber became Baker.

An archive service spokesman said: 
'This series of registration cards gives us a real glimpse into the 
conditions imposed upon these people in their homeland and the 
opportunities which presented themselves in the UK, USA and other 
countries.'
