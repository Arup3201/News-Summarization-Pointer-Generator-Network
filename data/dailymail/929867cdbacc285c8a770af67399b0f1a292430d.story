A terminally ill woman was evicted by police from a holiday villa, after the travel company failed to inform her it had cancelled her booking.

Lorraine Beasant was on a family trip to Mallorca – her last before her latest round of treatment for cancer – when she was forced to leave the five-bedroom property on the first night. 

The 57-year-old, who was on holiday with her husband, Mike, her three grown-up children and friends, booked the £1,450-a-week break through Villa Parade in 2013.

However, the company failed to tell Mrs Beasant she was no longer able to stay in the property, only sending her an email the day before her April 12, 2014, booking, which she did not read.

The 10 adults arrived at Villa Moncho - chosen because it had a downstairs bedroom so Mrs Beasant would not have to carry her medical equipment up stairs - gaining entry at about 2pm by using a code which was provide to them by Villa Parade.

However, neighbours alerted the Spanish owner, who called the police, who arrived later that evening.

Mrs 
Beasant told MailOnline Travel: ‘We were having a barbecue when the owner and the local police turned 
up at about 9pm. My son came in and said “I’m sorry to do this mum, but 
we’ve got to move out”.

‘It was a shock. 
It really upset me to be evicted hours after arriving.'

The
 property owner – who did not want to be named - claims he cancelled his
 contract with Villa Parade in November 2013.

He said he had no knowledge of Mrs Beasant's booking and called the police to help with translation.

Mrs
 Beasant, who has been told she has up to six months to live without treatment, said: 'We didn't see the email from Villa Parade as we were travelling. 

‘They knew we would be, so why they tried to contact us on that date is beyond me.

‘It was to be the last holiday with my children before my treatment, which is going to be horrendous. 

‘Because my children live all over the UK, it was incredibly important to get this holiday together.’

Mrs Beasant's family was moved to a nearby villa through Villa Select, booked through Villa Parade the day before the party was due to arrive in Mallorca, but it didn’t have a downstairs bedroom.

She said: ‘I was ill during that week because I had to deal with the stairs all day, and when you’re on oxygen… that was upsetting.

‘I have emailed Villa Parade about the situation, and they said they would look into it and come back to us within 28 days.’

Jason 
Kelly, a spokesman for Villa Parade said: ‘This matter is currently subject to an investigation in conjunction with ABTA and we are unable to make further comment at this time.

'Villa Parade would like to stress that they did try on four separate occasions to contact Mrs Beasant by phone to explain that the villa had been changed to a new property, but they could not get a response and on April 11, an email was issued stating that an alternative property had been arranged for her.

'Mrs Beasant however, arrived at the original villa, which, at the time was still being occupied by the owner.

'Villa Parade can confirm the Mrs Beasant was moved to the new property later the same day.

small independent villa operator, Villa Parade always put its customers 
first. And, as members of ABTA and ATOL, Villa Parade works tirelessly 
to ensure we provide the high standards expected by our customers, and

'Villa
 Parade would also like to stress that we were not aware of Mrs 
Beasant’s medical condition, but because everyone at Villa Parade are 
proactive supporters of Cancer Research UK we would like to offer Mrs 
Beasant and her family our sincere apology.'
