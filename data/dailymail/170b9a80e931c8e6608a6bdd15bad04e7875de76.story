Google stepped up its assault on the smartphone and tablet computer market today by buying Motorola's mobile phone division 
for $12.5billion (£7.7billion).

The move will bolster the adoption of Google's Android mobile phone software.

The acquisition of Motorola Mobility is by far Google's biggest to 
date and a sign that the online search leader is serious about expanding 
beyond its core internet business.

CEO Larry Page: Google is buying Motorola's mobile phone division for $12.5billion in a move to bolster the adoption of its Android mobile phone software

Google will pay $40 (£24) per share, a 63 per cent premium to Motorola's closing price on Friday.

Motorola Mobility was separated from the rest of Motorola in January.

The company has remade itself as a maker of smartphones based on 
Google's Android software, but has struggled against Apple and 
Asian smartphone makers.

Google chief executive Larry Page said in a statement: 'Motorola Mobility's total commitment to Android has created a natural 
fit for our two companies.

'Together, we will create amazing user experiences that supercharge the 
entire Android ecosystem for the benefit of consumers, partners and 
developers.'

Analysts believe Google's purchase is a reinforcement strategy in the face of seemingly unstoppable competition from Apple's iPhone.

Jason Jenkins, editor of technology website CNET UK,
said: 'Many of the main phone manufacturers are currently busy suing 
each other, with each claiming that the other has ripped off their ideas
in some way.

'As the maker of the Android operating system that powers millions of phones worldwide, Google faces the possibility that its efforts to grab more of the smartphone sector will be hampered by these lawsuits.

'This purchase, and the patents that come with it, helps shore up its position in its war against Apple's iPhone.'

He added: 'One of the oddities of today's announcement is that it places Google in direct competition with the companies it partners with - HTC, Samsung and the like - as it will now effectively be making not only the software that powers mobile phones, but the hardware too.

'Google has been quick to put out statements from Sony Ericsson, LG and HTC that welcome the move, but I can't help but wonder how comfortable they really are with this deal.'

The acquisition has the approval of both companies' boards and is 
expected to close by the end of this year or early 2012.

It dwarfs 
Google's previous biggest deal, the 2008 purchase of DoubleClick for 
$3.2billion (£2billion).

In premarket trading, shares of Motorola Mobility soared 60 per cent, or 
$14.72 (£9.01), to $39.19 (£24.00). Shares of Google, meanwhile, fell $14.68 (£8.99), or 2.6 
per cent, to $549.95 (£336.57).
