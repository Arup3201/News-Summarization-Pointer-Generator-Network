The teenage star of hit mafia TV series Gomorrah has been arrested for his alleged part in a brutal stabbing as vicious as any in the show.

Vincenzo Esposito, was plucked from a criminal family in Naples' most notorious ghetto, Scampia, to play mafioso wannabe Danielino, in the prime TV series on Italian television.

The ultra-violent show, based on Roberto Saviano’s bestselling expose Gomorrah, has broken all viewing records in Italy and is set to hit UK and US screens in the next few months.

In the mindless attack, a group of boys between 15 and 18 set on a young man of 21 after he shouted at them for urinating in the metro station at Scampia.

According to media reports: ‘Six or seven of them fell on the man with kicks and punches while a 15 year old stabbed him.

‘Another two attacked him from behind: One had a knife and inflicted ten stab wounds, seven of which doctors said were potentially lethal.’

Esposito, 16, grew up living with his grandmother because both his parents and his elder brother were in prison, an authentic background which directors said contributed to his selection.

After winning the part he dropped out of school. But in a tragic echo of the onscreen mayhem, in which his own character ends up murdered by a rival gang boss, the young actor is now in a youth detention centre.

In 2011 the 12-year-old Vincenzo had vowed not to follow his parents into a life of crime.

In a book published by his school on pupils’ ambitions, he said: ‘I have a dream, more than a dream, that when I am grown up I will live with my father and mother, as I am not spending my childhood with them.

‘I dream that when they get out of prison we will all live together, far away from Naples.

‘When I am grown up I will never make the same mistakes as my father. It’s not worth wasting your life in a cell or worse for the sake of money.’

A former teacher, Paolo Battimiello who has offered his support, told Italian newspaper La Repubblica: ‘I went to visit him last week- he’s calm. I hope that he manages to finish the education he began with us.

'I hope that his story, which we still hope can be turned around, makes clear that in this city the only way to destroy the Camorra culture is education.'
