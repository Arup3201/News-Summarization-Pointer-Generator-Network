Well, we knew it was coming. First, there he was, quoting Nietzsche. Next, he was backstage at a Morrissey concert. Refusing chicken. And finally, David Dimbleby was saying his name out loud on last week’s programme as if he were reading it in Klingon from the autocue.

Joey Barton helped QPR get back into the Premier League last weekend. But on Thursday night, the alice band was off as he came out to perform on telly’s toughest field of play - Question Time.

This week it came from Heathrow’s new Terminal Two. Where an audience stacked up like passengers waiting for a ton of snow delayed flights were introduced to Joey, by David Dimbleby, as the 'philosopher king' of football.

Invitation: Joey Barton appeared on BBC Question Time after being invited to join the panel

Making his point: Barton's first contribution was to say that the support for UKIP was a protest vote

And when 
that notion wasn’t greeted with a chorus of boos and a hail of rotting 
vegetable matter - Joey was clearly not the villain in the black hat 
with the twirly moustache -  it meant they could immediately move on to 
the first item on the agenda, namely UKIP and Nigel Farage.

Of
 which there was plenty to say, as you could imagine. But not for ages 
from the Hoops midfield general, who in this Question Time formation, 
was being played out wide on the left. We even heard from 'the man in 
the spectacles and blonde hair' in the audience before Joey chipped in. 
However, when he did, he certainly made an impact.

Joey
 Barton is clearly not an idiot. He is also a man who is used to doing 
his job under the unswerving gaze of the public. Which makes his 
analogy, in the opening gambit on the show about UKIP’s European 
success, all the more awkward, and annoying. Because he chose to look at
 the the nature of the voting public’s deliberation about the current 
social climate as a choice between 'four really ugly girls'.

Now
 I’m not so twee and naive as to pretend I don’t know where he was going
 with that. I clearly do. I’m sure we all do. And of course, he does. 
But it doesn’t make it right. So why did he? Why did he think that 
comparison, with an age to think about it as his other panelists 
blathered on, would be the one that nailed the point?

Well,
 to be fair to him, he answered that particular question later on. 
Further into the debate, a lady in the audience picked up positively on 
something else Joey had said, but also pulled him up on that statement. 
And with an apparent air of contrition physically familiar from his on 
field exploits having just lumped a member of the opposition, he put his
 hands up. 

Controversy: Barton's 'four ugly girls' analogy did not go down well with the audience and on social media

'I
 apologise', he told the audience, clearly aware of the fact that what 
he’d said earlier was still hanging in the air like a pall. 'Maybe I was
 a little bit nervous', he continued, before acknowledging what UKIP’s 
Louise Bours had earlier suggested that 'his brains were in his feet'.

And
 to a great extent, that worked in not making the audience his enemy. He
 went on to discuss very eloquently the ‘disillusioned voters’ who 
hadn’t made their way to a booth. As well as making a case for a new 
runway that didn’t, it turned out, end up adding to the traffic over his
 and his neighbours' rooftops around Heathrow.

'Nimbie'
 was a word the Dimbleby used in response to Barton’s statement. And 
Nimbie the extremely well-paid footballer with the dream house may be. 
But he still had a good stab at just being a man with a perfectly 
reasonable grievance, and was not afraid to air it.

Hitting back: UKIP MEP Louise Bours said Barton's point proved that 'footballers' brains are in their feet'

Dinner time: Piers Morgan posted this photo and wrote: 'All smiles over #BBCQT dinner. Have to say - Le Pitbull @Joey7Barton is great company. For an ugly bloke.'

In
 further being fair to him, he also managed to get all the panel nodding
 in agreement when they discussed the apparent protracted release of 
documents about the war in Iraq. 'I can’t see the point if we’re not 
going to get the whole truth', said Joey, before adding that the 
situation was not too dissimilar to the Hillsborough enquiry.

But
 in spite of all his worthy contributions to the show, it is clearly 
going to be the 'ugly girls' statement that will provide an apparent 
mirror into him and his chosen industry. There is no doubt he is an 
excellent English footballer. But he has constantly been there on the 
cusp for big clubs, and his country. And yet has always managed to find a
 way to not take it on to the next phase.

Joey
 is clearly clever enough to have deduced why this might be. And it is 
perhaps because he is always still potentially one 'ugly girls' moment 
away from sticking his foot in his mouth again, be it on the pitch, or 
with the press, which is a shame. Because there seems to be one of the 
good guys in there somewhere, waiting to get out.
