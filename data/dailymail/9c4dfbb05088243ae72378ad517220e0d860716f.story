The old managerial head versus the emerging force, the established team of winners versus the homegrown heroes. 

The Capital One Cup has many intriguing sub-plots and Sportsmail's Riath Al-Samarrai caught up with three legends of both clubs — Graham Roberts, Glenn Hoddle and Micky Hazard — to discuss how it might pan out.

Chelsea and Tottenham are set to face off in the Capital One Cup final on Sunday

Mail on Sunday: Chelsea v Tottenham — a game close to all your hearts. How do you assess where they both stand?

Hazard: What a great cup final. Chelsea are the finished article and they have probably the best manager in the world whereas Spurs are a work in progress with a young, up-and-coming manager.

Roberts: On paper it’s Chelsea’s to win but Spurs learnt on New Year’s Day that they can beat Chelsea. That will be a big factor in this — Spurs don’t have that doubt that they will have had before.

Hoddle: Spurs beating them 5-3 at the Lane will definitely give them a lot of confidence. You need belief going into a final. On the negative side, Tottenham playing on Thursday is very difficult for the manager. 

Another big question is the goalkeeper and I would definitely play the No 1 (Hugo Lloris over Michel Vorm). Jose Mourinho’s first trophy with Chelsea was the League Cup in 2005 and this game can get Spurs back on the trophy trail.

MoS: What do you make of the homegrown contingent coming through at Spurs? It’s probably the one area where Spurs have done noticeably better.

Hazard: In three or four years we could be talking about a very special group. I actually brought Ryan Mason to the club as an eight-year-old and Harry Kane has taken the league by storm. He was unbelievable against Chelsea in the 5-3. 

But look at the players Chelsea have brought in — Eden Hazard. What a super player. Then you have Diego Costa, Cesc Fabregas. It’s hard to see how they get beaten on paper.

Roberts: Hazard is only just behind Messi and Ronaldo and has time ahead of him. On song he will win any game by himself. Costa, when he is on form, is a real handful. But saying that, I don’t think (Federico) Fazio has ever lost against him.

Micky Hazard played for Chelsea from 1985-90 after playing for Tottenham for seven seasons

MoS: Kane for England?

Hoddle: He has improved so quickly this season but we’d be stupid to think that improvement curve is going to keep rising at the same speed. But if he keeps at the level he is now that is magnificent. If he can maintain the consistency, playing different roles, he’ll go into the England squad. He’s not in front of the likes of Daniel Sturridge at the moment but if he continues to flourish and score more goals, he’ll force his way in.

MoS: Kane’s had an impact, but so has Jose Mourinho. People are perhaps getting tired of some of his talking, especially with recent incidents. Is it a distraction to the team?

Hoddle: I don’t think it’s a good thing. I can see he’s trying to put his point across but for me that has to be done behind the scenes, directly to the powers that be. I feel it’s a distraction. Their form hasn’t been great while this has all been happening, put it that way.

Roberts: He does talk a lot. But I think he is 100 per cent good for the Premier League. When he left last time I think the division lost a little bit of its soul. But aside from that charisma, he is probably the best manager in the world. But we all love a character. I worked with Graeme Souness at Rangers. I used to make sure I was on his side in training.

Hoddle believes that Jose Mourinho's actions surrounding recent incidents haven't been a good thing

MoS: You’ve all played a few Spurs-Chelsea fixtures — which ones stand out?

Hazard: I remember one for Spurs in the (1982) FA Cup quarter-final when we played Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. 

At quarter-to-three we were stuck in traffic on Fulham Road so we were getting our gear out of the boot, dressing on the bus and then when we arrived we sprinted straight to the pitch. We were 1-0 down at half-time but came out second half and played football made in heaven. Glenn and I both scored and we won 3-2.

Hoddle: I remember being Chelsea player-manager at Stamford Bridge and being 1-0 down to Spurs. Chelsea had beaten Tottenham so many times and hadn’t been beaten by Tottenham for years. I’m thinking, ‘Oh my word, I cannot be the first manager for so many years to lose to Tottenham’. 

I was on the bench and I start warming up in front of the Tottenham fans, who start singing: ‘You’re Spurs and you know you are.’ That puts me under a bit of pressure — if I wave I’m damned; if I don’t wave, I’m damned. I tried to give them a sly little wave, while I was stretching. 

In the end, I came on and I put a cross in for Dennis Wise, who scored. That got me off the hook. I think it was a couple of situations like that which made me decide to hang my boots up at the end of the season.

MoS: Mourinho suggested recently that Eden Hazard needs more protection from officials. Obviously it was a different type of game in the Eighties.

Hazard: I love to see the skill players so I don’t want to see them tackled out of existence. But if someone says today’s football is too physical it makes me laugh. Every game I was kicked. I am not sure we have the balance right today. 

Tackling is a skill and players should be allowed to express that skill as well. Graham Roberts was the best tackler I have ever seen — he was not nasty. He was a clever footballer and would adapt today but if he played today like he did then, even though he would take the ball he would be sent off every week!

Roberts: I don’t think the players now help themselves. I saw (Branislav) Ivanovic roll three or four times the other day and then get up — he is a brilliant player and one of the strong guys but even he’s rolling.

Hoddle: The two eras are motorways away from each other in the way rules are implemented. I think that’s a good thing. I think sometimes it’s a little bit over the top, though, with all the protection. But in general I like the way the game is going. The quality of pitches and the refereeing now makes it so much easier for technical players. 

We’re all in different eras and if Eden Hazard had been playing then he would still have been a great player. I remember the 1981 FA Cup final, Gerry Gow was trying to put me in row Z. That’s why it’s so hard to judge Messi against Maradona, because Maradona used to get kicked from pillar to post every game. If he was playing in this era he would be even more frightening.

MoS: Is this the best ever Chelsea team?

Hazard: Of the players when we were playing I’d say only Kerry Dixon really would get in this side. Of course, Glenn would waltz into any team, then or now. His football was like Mozart’s music. But I don’t know if this Chelsea team is better than Jose’s first go.

Roberts: Kerry Dixon scored 35 a year so I think he would get in the Chelsea side now. And no doubt that Glenn would get in. But if this isn’t the best Chelsea team then it’s close. I think overall now if they put their best 11 out they are hard for any side in the world to beat.

Hoddle: With (Didier) Drogba up there in his heyday, I think that early team just shades it for me at the moment. This team might look a little more stylish. They might go on and be better than that team. They are very close now. This will be a very hard game for Spurs.

The Capital One Cup final is one of a record 13 trophy lifts that Sky Sports viewers will be able to enjoy at the end of this season. From Sunday, 2:30pm, fans can follow the highly anticipated final between Chelsea and Tottenham live on Sky Sports 1.
