A Turkish mayor highlighted the plight of the visually impaired on an international disabled day by slapping a blind man around the back of the head.

Spectators at a public rally gasped when Altinok Oz cuffed Ozgur Ugur on the back of the head as the latter addressed the crowd on the United Nations' World Disability Day.

Then as Mr Ugur span on his heels to work out what had happened, the grinning politician made a 'shhh' gesture before surprising his fellow speaker with a friendly kiss.

Funny? Spectators gasped when Turkish mayor Altinok Oz cuffed Ozgur Ugur, who is blind, on the back of his head during a rally in Istanbul for the United Nations' World Disability Day

Mr Ugur had been speaking at an event in the western city of Istanbul, organised by Turkey's Republican People's Party, as the political group's main spokesman for disability, when Mayor Oz played his trick.

What followed appeared like a pantomime farce as Mr Ugur, representative of the municipality's disabled people unit, slowly turned the wrong way in an effort to locate his assailant.

Mr Oz gestured for people to remain quiet and allowed Mr Ugur to spin a full 270 degrees before halting his search and kissing him on both cheeks, to laughs from the watching crowd.

The UN warns that people with disabilities are at higher risk of violence, stigma and discrimination. So perhaps Mr Oz, mayor of Istanbul's Kartal district, was trying to make a clever point.

If it did it fell flat and his bizarre antics led to an avalanche of outraged calls for his resignation.

One online commenter, Selcuk Potuk, said: 'Is he out of his mind? Is he drunk? How can anyone think abusing a blind man is funny? He has to go.'

He's behind you! What followed appeared like a pantomime farce as Mr Ugur, representative of the municipality's disabled people unit, slowly turned the wrong way in an effort to locate his assailant

Wait for it: As Mr Ugur span on his heels to work out what happened, grinning Mayor Oz made a 'ssh' gesture

More than a billion people - about 15 per cent of the world's population - live with some form of disability, according to the UN.

The supranational body says people with disabilities generally have poorer health, lower education achievements, fewer economic opportunities and higher rates of poverty than people without disabilities.

Observing the Day, marked annually on December 3, UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon said disabled people face limitations and hardships largely due to the lack of services available to them.

'Through adaptive, assistive and inclusive technology, persons with disabilities can make the most of their potential in their communities and in the workplace,' said Mr. Ban.

Evidence shows that when barriers to their inclusion are removed and persons with disabilities are empowered to participate fully in societal life, their entire community benefits, the UN said.

The punchline: Mayor Oz stopped his fellow speaker three-quarters of his way around a full spin and surprised him with a kiss on both cheeks. Despite criticism, his spokesman said the gesture was 'just a joke'

Despite the brickbats he faced for his apparently insensitive display, Mr Oz refused to back down, claiming he and Mr Ugur were friends and it had just been a joke.

A spokesman for the Town Hall public relations department claimed the pair were 'as close as father and son', adding 'this was just a joke. It was a bit like a ritual greeting.'

The statement, seen by Turkey's Hurriyet Daily News, also quoted Mr Ugur defending the mayor by calling the gesture a 'beautiful greeting'.

He was quoted as saying: 'Can’t people see the full picture? Are they blind?'
