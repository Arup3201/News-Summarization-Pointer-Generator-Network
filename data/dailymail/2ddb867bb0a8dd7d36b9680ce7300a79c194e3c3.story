A man has watched so much Olympics on TV that it blew up, killing him in a freak house fire.

Fire investigators believe the man died when his TV caught alight from overheating after being left switched on or on standby too long.

Perhaps it was Britain’s growing medal tally or his keen love of sport that kept Peter Horbury watching but it was a tragic and unusual end for the man who lived alone.

Too much telly: Investigators believe the cause of the house fire was Peter Horbury's TV which overheated after being left on too long or on standby

The 69-year-old died from smoke inhalation after the blaze broke out in his house in Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire at 6.20am today.

One neighbour said Mr Horbury was a huge sports fan who was looking forward to the Olympics.

The neighbour, who wished not to be named, said: ‘Peter was sports mad. The last time I spoke to him he was really looking forward to the Olympics.

‘He didn’t get any tickets, I don’t think he could afford them, but he said he was going to watch as much of it as he could on television.

‘Peter used to run a pub years ago and he was into his darts and football but he loved all sports.

'The full investigation into the fire hasn’t finished yet but I imagine if it was the TV which caused it then it would be because he had watched so much of the Olympics.’

Rescue crews including 20 firefighters put out the fire and police and forensic experts were called in to investigate.

Loved the Olympics: Neighbours said Mr Horbury was sports mad and with so many British medals won in the last 24 hours including men's canoe double Tim Baillie and Etienne Stott, it's no wonder the TV stayed on

Stanley West, 82, who lived next door, noticed the windows were black with smoke this morning and called emergency services.

He said: ‘I went round and looked in the window and saw all the smoke.

‘The only other thing we heard was a noise at 2.40am which sounded like a table being dragged across the floor.

Check your electronics: In light of the fire, the fire chief warned that all electrical items need to be switched off when not in use

‘I don’t know him very well. He kept himself to himself, but it’s still a shock to wake up to this on your doorstep.

‘His television maybe overheated, it’s possible he had been watching a lot of Olympic coverage and maybe that that was the cause of the fire.’

Another neighbour, who wished not to be named, said Mr Horbury lived alone but was regularly visited by his sister and son.

She said: ‘It’s so sad. It was crawling with firefighters on the morning he was found. 

‘He was a nice bloke and a bit of a character and I used to go across occasionally and have a cup of tea with him. 

‘It’s upset me. I’ve been trying to do my housework this morning but I just can’t think of anything else.’

Warning people to check electrical equipment, Deputy Chief Fire Officer John Buckley, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: ‘Our advice is to switch off all electrical items that can be turned off when they are not in use, make sure sockets are not overloaded, and check for loose wires and faulty plugs.’
