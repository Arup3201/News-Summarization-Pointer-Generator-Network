'Manipulation': Tom Winsor, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary, spoke at the Home Affairs Select Committee to dispute Met chief evidence

The police watchdog has told MPs that it is 'almost certain that some manipulation is going on' in the recording of crime statistics by officers.

Tom Winsor, Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary, told the Home Affairs Select Committee 'in anything that gets measured' there is an 'incentive, resisted by many, to manipulate the process to make your own performance look good'.

And Mr Winsor, the first chief inspector of constabulary to come from a non-policing background, disputed evidence given by the chief of the Metropolitan Police, Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, who claimed inspectors lauded his force's crime data as 'competent and reliable'.

His comments come after whistle-blowing police constable James Patrick told the Public Administration Select Committee officers routinely massage crime statistics to boost their forces' performance figures.

Asked by Committee chair Keith Vaz MP if there is manipulation occurring, Mr Winsor, a former rail regulator and lawyer, said: 'It is almost certain that some manipulation going on. The question is where, how much, how severe.'

He earlier added: 'The fact is in anything that gets measured, once those who are being measured, whose performance are being measured, work out how the system works, there's an incentive, resisted by many, to manipulate the process as to make your own performance look good.'

Mr Vaz said Sir Bernard and Sir Hugh Orde, the president of the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), had not told the Committee earlier this month that they believe fiddling of statistics is currently occurring.

Mr Winsor said: 'Sir Bernard gave evidence, I think to this committee on December 3, where he said that in 2012 HMIC inspected the Met and found their figures in terms of crime recording were "competent and reliable".

'I've written to Sir Bernard about this because what HMIC in fact said was that it looked at "244 incidents logged by the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS), 30 had been wrongly closed without a crime being raised, while in overall terms the MPS continues to improve its crime and incident data quality, this indicates that crime and ASB (anti-social behaviour) data recorded in London gives some cause for concern".

Dispute: Chief of the Metropolitan Police, Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, claimed inspectors lauded his force's crime data as 
'competent and reliable' but Mr Winsor has written to him to dispute this

'So there is a big difference between "some cause of concern" and "competent and reliable". I have not yet received Sir Bernard's response.'

Mr Vaz asked the chief inspector if he was still 'very concerned'.

Mr Winsor added: 'I'd just like him to explain the disparity I'd referred to. But with crime recording, some people will call it fiddling, some people will call it honest mistakes, some people will call it the perfectly legitimate exercise of professional judgment.'

Asked what he would call it, the chief inspector said: 'It depends on the circumstances of individual cases.'

Mr Patrick - who is currently awaiting disciplinary proceedings - also told the Public Administration Select Committee that serious offences including rape and child sex abuse are being recorded as 'crime-related incidents' or 'no crimes'.

And a former chief inspector in West Midlands Police told the same hearing about techniques used by officers to improve performance figures known as 'cuffing', 'nodding', 'skewing' and 'stitching'.
