A South Carolina couple is holding on to hope they may one day be reunited with their curly-haired adopted daughter, whose Native American biological father now has custody of the child, after the U.S. Supreme Court announced on Friday that it would hear their complex case that involves tribal law.

Matt and Melanie Capobianco were overjoyed when they adopted little Veronica in September 2009 but were dealt a crushing blow when her biological father, who had never met the girl, gained custody of the child by invoking the Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978, which grants American Indian parents preference in custody disputes.

The Capobianocs were forced to relinquish custody on New Year's Eve in 2011 but just one year later are hopeful that the highest court may rule in their favor and return Veronica to the parents who raised her.

Innocence: After three years with her adoptive parents in South Carolina, little Veronica was given to her biological father, who had never met the girl

Happy family: Matt and Melanie Capobianco, with their adopted daughter Veronica, were in the delivery room when the child was born in Oklahoma in September 2009

Christy, Veronica's birth mother who is not Native American, has said that she decided to give the child up for adoption after her relationship with Veronica's father, Dusten Brown, ended in April 2009 and she was pregnant with the couple's child. The couple were never married.

Alone and uncertain of her future, the mother thought adoption was the best route and decided on the Capobiancos in July 2009.

Matt Capobianco works as a technician at Boeing and his wife Melanie has a doctorate in developmental psychology. The pair had tried to have children of their own that included a painful journey of seven unsuccessful attempts at in vitro fertilization.

The birth mother, who has supported the adoptive couple throughout the custody battle with Brown, said the father relinquished his parental rights via text message.

But the birth father claims that the girl was conceived when he was engaged to the birth mother but that she broke up with him via text messages.

Though he admits that he did relinquish his parental rights in exchange for not paying child support, he said that he never knew his former fianc√©e intended to give the child up for adoption.

The adoptive couple were in the delivery room when Veronica was born on September 15, 2009 and they took the girl from Oklahoma to their home in Charleston, South Carolina.

The adoption was finalized in January
2010 but in the paperwork, the biological father was not 
reportedly not identified as Native American.

Though
Brown signed a legal document agreeing to put the girl up for 
adoption, he attorneys later claimed that he did not have a clear 
understanding of what he had signed and alleged that the birth mother 
had not fully identified the child's heritage as an American Indian to 
social service workers.

Lawyers for the father say that the
non-Indian mother initiated an adoption outside the tribe and thus the 
father has a right to pursue custody under the claims of the Cherokee 
Nation.

New home: Before Veronica's birth, Brown gave up his parental rights and her mother put her up for adoption

Fight: The Capobiancos have questioned whether it is right for a man - who previously showed no interest in his daughter - take her back simply because he is Native American

In July 2011, due to the National Indian Child Welfare Act, a South Carolina court ruled that Brown had a right to custody of the child, who was 22-months-old at the time.

The National Indian Child Welfare 
Association (NICWA) is a federal law established in 1978 to keep 
American Indian children with American Indian families. The law came as a response to a high 
number of children that were being taken from their communities and 
placed into non Native American homes.

Brown, who had never met the girl, came to South Carolina in December 2011 and took Veronica into his care. The Capobiancos have not seen her since.

After a legal battle, the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled in favor of Brown in July 2012 even though the court acknowledged the adoptive couple had demonstrated they were 'ideal parents who have exhibited the ability to provide a loving family environment.'

A dissenting justice called the ruling a 'human tragedy.'

'I profoundly disagree with the majority's elevation of the Indian Child Welfare Act to a position of total dominance over state law and settled principles of the best interests of the child,' South Carolina's Supreme Court Justice Kaye Hearn wrote in her opinion last summer.

Missed: The couple that raised the girl since her birth in Sep. 2009 have not seen her since Dec. 2011

Back and forth: Lawyers for Veronica's birth dad, Dusten Brown, have maintained that he is a good parent and have said the 3-year-old is happy and healthy in his care

Following the disappointing ruling in
their home state, attorneys for the couple appealed to the U.S. Supreme
Court in October 2012 and have gained supporters through their website, SaveVeronica.org, where allies can donate to help cover the legal costs.

In their petition to the high court, attorneys for the adoptive parents lamented the 'bare majority of the South Carolina Supreme Court [that] ordered petitioners to surrender custody of the two-year-old daughter.'

The petition adds that the application of the Indian Child Welfare Act 'has disrupted the lives of children, their parents, extended families, the adoptive parents, and others and has sent a "chilling message" to any couple wishing to adopt a child of Native American descent.'

The Attorney General for the Cherokee
Nation Todd Hembree has said that the intent in applying the law is not
to rip a child away from a loving home.

'We want to make sure those loving home have the opportunity to be Indian homes first,' he told CNN.

Hopeful: The couple are hoping that the U.S. Supreme Court will allow them to be reunited with their daughter

Heavy heart: Matt Capobianco weeps over little Veronica, who he hasn't seen since Dec. 2011

Expectant: The adoptive parents have Veronica's room ready and waiting for her as they pray the court will rule in their favor

Lawyers
for Brown said the biological father is a good parent and have said 
Veronica is 'happy, healthy and thriving' in her new living situation 
with her biological father.

After waiting for months and 
agonizing over the separation with their child, the couple were 
overjoyed when the court agreed to hear their case.

'We are going to the U.S. Supreme Court! Praise God!' they wrote on their Facebook page on Facebook, to the more than 8,000 followers of their cause.

'It has been an extremely difficult year but we now have a renewed sense of faith in our legal system,' the couple added in a statement.

'We remain hopeful that our daughter will finally be able to come home and to have a life where she can be surrounded by everyone who loves her. There is no way we could have gotten this far without the support from our family, friends and our supporters. We are beyond grateful and appreciate the continued prayers.'

The Capobiancos remain in touch with the biological mother, who
supports their parental rights, but Brown has not allowed them to 
contact Veronica.

They told CNN that they have had one phone call with the girl since she left in December 2011 and that they told her they love her.
