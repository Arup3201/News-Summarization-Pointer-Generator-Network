A pharmacist shot and killed an armed robber from behind the counter using his conceal and carry permit weapon. 

Don Radcliff was working at Good Pharmacy in Pinch, West Virginia, on Wednesday when Terry Gillenwater, 25, walked in wearing a mask while eight other customers were in the store.

Surveillance footage shows the attacker standing in line for a few moments before pulling the weapon and aiming it at employees.  

Unaware: A masked man walked into the Good Pharmacy in Pinch, West Virginia, as employees counted cash at a register 

Attack: Terry Gillenwater, 25, then pulls out his gun (top left) and demands money. But pharmacist Don Radcliff draws his own weapon and starts shooting

Standing just a few feet away, Mr Radcliff quickly drew his own gun and him twice.

He then walked out from behind the cash register and fired again, downing the suspect. 

Gillenwater was taken to hospital but died a short time later. 

Mr Radcliff returned to work just 24 hours later, but admitted he was shaken by what happened. 

He told WCHSTV it was his daily devotional offers to God have given him comfort. 

'So many times when I read this daily devotional it's exactly what I need to hear. And today it was what I needed to hear,' he said. 

Radcliff's wife, Dixie, said it was an emotional day for the pair and they are still trying to process what happened.

Response: The attacker keels over as he tries to run away from the brave employee 

Firing: Mr Radcliff hit Gillenwater twice as he fled. The suspect was taken to hospital and later died 

Return: Mr Radcliff was back in work just 24 hours later, but admitted he was shaken up by what happened 

Support: His wife, Dixie, (left) said it was an emotional day for the pair and they are still trying to process what happened
