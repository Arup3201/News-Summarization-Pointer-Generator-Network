NHS bosses have warned pregnant women against using a specific type of home birthing pool after a baby became infected with Legionnaire's disease

NHS bosses have warned pregnant women against using a specific type of birthing pool at home after a baby born in one was infected with Legionnaire's disease.

The newborn is in intensive care and is described as being 'severely ill'.

Samples taken from the heated birthing pool have confirmed the presence of legionella bacteria, which causes Legionnaires' disease - a serious lung infection.

Experts are carrying out tests to establish if it is the same strain as that which infected the baby.

Public Health England (PHE) and NHS England today advised against the use of the pools, which have built-in heaters and recirculation pumps, and can be filled two weeks before the birth.

It is the first reported case of Legionnaire's disease linked to a birthing pool in England, PHE said.

Professor Nick Phin, PHE’s head of Legionnaires’ disease, said: 'This is an extremely unusual situation, which we are taking very seriously.

'As a precaution, we advise that heated birthing pools, filled in advance of labour and where the temperature is then maintained by use of a heater and pump, are not used in the home setting, while we investigate further and until definitive advice on disinfection and safety is available.'

NHS England issued a Patient Safety Alert to notify the healthcare system - and midwives in particular - of the possible risk associated with the use of the heated birthing pools at home.

The alert recommends that heated birthing pools are not used for labour or birth. A full risk assessment is being carried out in the meantime.

Heated pools from the supplier involved in the incident have been recalled, PHE said.

There are around 10 firms which supply the specific pools and each have between two and 14, which they loan out. 

The pools are typically delivered around a fortnight before the expected delivery date and filled from the domestic hot water supply.

The temperature is then maintained by a pump and heater until labour and delivery, with the companies recommending various disinfection regimes.

PHE said the majority of birthing pools used at home are filled from domestic hot water systems at the time of labour and these do not pose the same risk and are not included in the alert.

Prof Phin said: 'We do not have concerns about purchased or hired pools that are filled from domestic hot water supplies at the onset of labour, provided that any pumps are used solely for pool emptying.

'PHE and relevant local authorities 
are investigating the infection control measures required for this type 
of birthing pool and local authorities will be working with the small 
number of companies who supply these heated birthing pools for use at 
home.'

Louise Silverton, 
director for midwifery at the Royal College of Midwives, said: 'Women 
planning birth at home using a traditional pool that is filled when the 
woman is in labour or using a fixed pool in an NHS unit are not affected
 by this alert and should not be concerned.

Legionnaire's disease is a serious lung infection caused by legionella bacteria.

Initial symptoms include a high fever, muscle pain and chills.

Once the bacteria infects a person's lungs, they may also develop a persistant cough, chest pains and breathing problems.

A urine test can detect the disease.

Legionnaire's disease is usually caught by breathing in small droplets of contaminated water.

It is not contagious and cannot be spread directly from person to person.

Legionella bacteria is commonly found in water, including lakes and rivers, though is often in harmlessly low numbers.

However, the bacteria can multiply if they find their way into artifical water supplies, including air conditioning systems.

Legionnaire's disease is commonly treated with a course of antibiotics.

The condition can be particularly serious in people with pre-existing health problems.

Most people make a full recovery, but in some cases it can lead to further life-threatening complications.

The disease can cause your lungs and kidneys to stop working properly.

Another complication is septic shock, which is the result of a blood infection causing a sudden drop in blood pressure.

Between 10 and 15 per cent of otherwise healthy people who contract Legionnaire's disease will die due to problems as a result of the condition.

In 2010 there were 38 deaths from Legionnaire's disease in England and Wales.

'Birthing pools in hospitals are subject to stringent infection control procedures and monitoring.

'Home birthing pools filled during labour come with disposable liners and are only in place for a relatively short time period, reducing opportunity for bacterial growth.

'Any women with concerns about using home birthing pools should contact their midwife or local maternity unit.'

Legionnaires’ disease is extremely rare in children, with only one case in youngsters aged up to nine in England between 1990 and 2011.

Although there were two cases reported in Italy and Japan several years ago, it is the first reported case of Legionnaires’ disease linked to a birthing pool in England.

Patients become infected with the bacteria through inhalation of contaminated water droplets. The infection does not spread from person to person.

The disease is a severe form of pneumonia which affects around 350 to 400 people each year in England and Wales. The majority of cases involve older patients.

NHS information about the condition says that most people make a full recovery but 'in some cases it can lead to further, life-threatening, problems'.

Midwives and every local authority in the country are being contacted to see if they use the specific pools provided by any of the companies that supply them.

If the pools are currently out for use, councils and midwives should take steps to get them back, a PHE spokeswoman said.

The spokeswoman declined to give any further information about the sick baby, including when and where it was born and its sex.

The NHS patient safety alert described the child as 'severely ill'.

The company that supplied the pool involved has not been named.

Microbiologists and nursing bosses today moved to reassure expectant mothers that this is an 'extremely rare' case.

Carmel Bagness, Midwifery and Women's Health Adviser at the RCN said it is right that the precautions taken by Public Health England and NHS England were enforced.

She said the warnings apply only to a specific type of birthing pool.

She said: 'This is a highly unusual situation, and it is right that the proper precautions are taken, but women should be reassured that this alert does not apply to home pools which are filled at the time of labour, or fixed pools in NHS units, which do not pose the same risk.

'Any woman or partner concerned about this alert should contact their midwife or maternity unit for further information.'

Professor Nigel Brown, President, Society for General Microbiology, said: 'Legionnaires' disease is often caused by inhaling water droplets containing the bacterium Legionella, which can reproduce in warm water systems.

Experts are carrying out more tests to establish if the strain of legionella bacteria which infected the baby was the same as that found in the birthing pool. File picture

'It is a particularly serious illness in the elderly and immunocompromised individuals, including young infants.

'Legionella is common in the environment and one of the reasons why air conditioning systems have to be regularly serviced to remove bacterial build-up.'

Prof Mark Fielder, Professor in Medical Microbiology, Kingston University, said: 'The recent report of a baby being treated in intensive care following the diagnosis of Legionnaires’ disease is an unfortunate and very rare occurrence.

'The case has been reported by Public Health England they have already advised against a specific type of birthing pool with built in heaters and recirculation pumps.

'The specific type of pool implicated can be filled in advance of labour and the temperature is maintained by the heater and pump.

'Birthing pools that are filled from domestic hot water systems at the time of labour do not appear to possess the same risk factors and are not included under the current exclusion. 

'This single case does represent a rare occurrence, indeed this is the first case reported in England from a birthing pool (there were two other cases reported internationally in past years, one in Italy in 1999).

'The infection is caused by a bacterium called Legionella pneumophilia which can be found commonly in water sources and at low levels it is harmless.

'The organism can be controlled effectively if the water is cooled to below 20˚C or heated to above 60˚C.

'This type of treatment coupled with general good hygiene in terms of keeping water free of impurities will help to keep the organism under control.'
