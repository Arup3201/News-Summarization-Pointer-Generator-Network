Christian Eriksen's consistently brilliant performances with Tottenham Hotspur this season have attracted the interest of clubs around Europe - but Spurs icon Jurgen Klinsmann hopes the Dane will resist the temptation to move.

The 23-year-old has 11 goals for Spurs this season and, alongside breakthrough star Harry Kane, has provided the main attacking threat as Mauricio Pochettino looks to break into the Barclays Premier League top four.

And with Europe's elite inevitably sniffing around in the hope of signing Eriksen, former Tottenham striker Klinsmann has expressed his hope that the north London club can hang on to one of their star performers.

Klinsmann, a former Tottenham favourite, comes up against Eriksen when his US team face Denmark

The former Germany international, who now manages the US national team, spent one season at White Hart Lane in the 1994-95 campaign but wants Eriksen to stay longer than his spell.

'There's no bigger club than Tottenham,' Klinsmann joked when asked if Eriksen could play for a bigger club. 'Every player chooses their own path and sees their own limit, and I'm sure he wants to see his own limits and where he can go one day.

'For me, Tottenham was a wonderful experience and I wouldn't have wanted to miss a second of it. But I chose to leave the club for Bayern Munich to win trophies.

Klinsmann said he was 'curious' to see how many more years Eriksen would stay at Tottenham

'I hope he stays for a long time at Spurs. It's a very competitive squad so there's no time for him to relax as someone will jump in and take his spot. I'm curious to see him for many more years at Tottenham.

Klinsmann's US side face Eriksen's Denmark on Wednesday evening, and Klinsmann had praise for the 'tremendously talented' Danish playmaker.

'He is an exceptional talent and that's why he's at Tottenham,' he said. 'He's tremendously talented and seeing some of his goals this season and how he has been the difference in some of the games shows that he can turn it on.'
