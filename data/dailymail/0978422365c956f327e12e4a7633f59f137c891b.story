Rich Americans are donating less to charity in the wake of the recession - while the poorest in the country are giving more.

A report by the Chronicle of Philanthropy found that Americans earning at least  $200,000 a year cut their charitable donations by 4.6 per cent between 2006 and 2012.

Meanwhile, those who took home $25,000 or less - the poorest Americans - increased their giving by nearly 17 per cent over the same period.

In general, low and middle-income Americans dug deeper than their wealthier counterparts post-recession. The report found that those who made less than $100,000 gave five per cent more in 2012 than they did in 2006.

'Lower and middle-income people know people who lost their jobs or are homeless, and they worry that they themselves are a day away from losing their jobs,' explained Stacy Palmer, editor of the The Chronicle of Philanthropy.

'They're very sensitive to the needs of other people and recognize that these years have been hard.'

But it seems that those at the other end of the scale are less inclined to be generous when times are tough economically. Ms Palmer explained that higher-income people tend to give proportionately less during times of recession.

'The downturn was a shock to so many of them, and they've been nervous and cautious,' she said.

However, rich Americans still gave more in absolute terms between 2006 and 2012, increasing their donations  by $4.6 billion to $77.5 billion, using inflation-adjusted dollars.

The study found that Americans give, on average, about 3 per cent of their income to charity, a figure that has not shifted significantly for decades. 

Overall, Americans donated $180 billion to charity in 2012, with the sharpest drops in giving found in the United States' biggest cities.

The steepest declines from across the nation  were in Philadelphia and Buffalo, New York, where the share of income donated fell by more than 10 per cent.

Those in Los Angeles, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and Washington, D.C., were also significantly less generous when it came to charity, with declines of more than 9 per cent.

Utah residents were the most generous across the United States, donating $65.60 to charity for every $1,000 earned.

Salt Lake City was the most philanthropic city, with residents donating more than five per cent of their incomes to charitable causes. This was largely due to the large population of Mormons, who are urged to donate a significant proportion of their incomes to charity, the report noted

Salt Lake City was the most philanthropic city, with residents donating more than 5 per cent of their incomes to charitable causes.

This was largely due to the large population of Mormons, who are urged to donate a significant proportion of their incomes to charity, the report noted.

'The Mormon tradition of tithing is a primary reason residents of (Utah) well outpace those in every other place in America,' it said.

New Hampshire was the least philanthropic state, with residents donating $17.40 of every $1,000 earned. North Dakota residents gave 16 per cent less, making it the state with the greatest fall, with $24 donated for every $1,000 earned.

The steepest declines from across the nation drops were in Philadelphia and Buffalo, New York (pictured), where the share of income donated fell by more than 10 per cent

Out of the 50 largest cities, Las Vegas saw the highest climb in charitable giving, with residents donating nearly 15 per cent more of their incomes to charities in 2012.

At a state level, Nevada also saw the fastest-growing rate of charitable donations.

Just behind Nevada, the states that experienced the biggest growth in the share of giving were Idaho, Georgia, Connecticut, and Florida.

Ms Palmer noted that the shift in charitable giving, with the wealthy donating less, is likely to mean less cash flowing into universities, hospitals and cultural institutions, which richer Americans tend to patronize.

Lower and middle-income donors tend to be more inclined to donate to social service organizations. But she added that in part because these groups have had fewer dollars to give, those organizations still faced a squeeze during the recession.
