A BBC reporter has been attacked live on air by an 'angry Israeli' as he reported from the border between Israel and the Gaza Strip.

Feras Khatib was speaking from the Israeli city of Ashkelon this morning when without warning he was hurled sideways by an unidentified assailant.

Colleagues of the BBC Arabic correspondent restrained the man and pulled him out of shot as Mr Khatib regained his composure, continuing to speak within just one second.

The attacker soon left and was not arrested, while the reporter - who was speaking Arabic during his broadcast at 10.30am British time - was unharmed.

The incident highlights the level of tension in Israel as international outrage builds over the two-week war which has so far killed more than 600 Palestinians and 29 Israelis.

Gaza's Health Ministry says at least 609 Palestinians have been killed in the territory, while the U.N. office of humanitarian affairs estimates at least three quarters were civilians, Reuters reported.

An Israeli soldier was killed today in fighting in southern Gaza, raising the number of Israeli troops confirmed dead to 27. Two Israeli civilians also have been killed.

Mr Khatib was wearing a prominent blue flak jacket with 'press' printed across it when he was attacked.

Force: The man entered the shot suddenly and shoved the reporter out of the way, but he soon continued

He has not been the only journalist to come under the pressure of the renewed conflict live on air.

On Sunday Al Jazeera correspondent Wael Al-Dahdouh, who was won awards for his coverage, was overcome by emotion in the middle of a broadcast about Palestinians killed by Israeli jet fighters.

Breaking off his account mid-sentence, he began to weep before walking out of view of the camera.

A BBC spokesman told MailOnline: 'While reporting live from inside the Israeli city of Ashkelon this morning BBC Arabic reporter Feras Khatib was manhandled by an angry Israeli.

'Feras was unharmed and will continue reporting as normal.'

Mr Khatib, an Arab Israeli citizen, came to the Corporation over a year ago from Sky News Arabia after studying global media in London, the spokesman added.
