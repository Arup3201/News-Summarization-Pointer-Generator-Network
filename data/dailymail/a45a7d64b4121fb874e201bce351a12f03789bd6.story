Claims emerged on Tuesday that Chris Brown has fathered a nine-month-old child with a longtime friend.

The woman in question, according to TMZ, is an aspiring model and nursing student from Texas named Nia Amey (aka Nia Gonzalez).

And perhaps adding insult to injury Brown's now ex girlfriend Karrueche Tran (she broke up with him on Wednesday via Twitter) not only knows Nia, she has partied with her.

Meet the 'baby mama': Claims emerged this week that Chris Brown has fathered a nine-month-old child with a longtime friend and model named Nia Amey

They've met before: Karrueche Tran pictured with her arm around Nia in an Instagram snap from a Las Vegas party in May 2013

The two women are in Brown's circle of friends and were both seen at a party in Las Vegas in May 2013.

Karrueche was even pictured with her arm around Nia in an Instagram snap as the two women wore bikinis and blew kisses at the camera.

Meanwhile, pictures from 31-year-old Nia's modelling site see her topless as she describes herself as someone who is always up for adventure.

The Hispanic Texan says in her modelling profile from 2009: 'My name is Nia Amey. I am a 25 year old aspiring model. 

'I'm a full time nursing student and a very outgoing person. I love photography and always up for new adventures.'

TMZ claims, Nia has 'known Chris for several years'. Sources connected to both Nia and Chris told the site they are 'on very good terms', however they are currently not dating. 

MediaTakeOut claims that Nia has been raising the child with another man, who has been led to believe he is the father.

On Wednesday morning Brown's on-off girlfriend Karrueche dumped the singer via Twitter, writing: 'Listen. One can only take so much. The best of luck to Chris and his family.' 

'No baby drama for me,' the model and socialite concluded, breaking up with the troubled young man (once again) on the micro-blogging site.

It is unclear if Brown, 25, was on a break during his tumultuous relationship with Karrueche when he allegedly fathered the nine-month-old child. 

The Loyal singer has been romantically liked to model Karrueche for the past four years. However the pair's relationship has always been rocky, and the pair have frequently split before reuniting.

The pair were seen together last month, hand in hand at New York Fashion Week. But back in December, Chris launched a lengthy attack on his girlfriend via Instagram.

After pulling her up on only visiting him once during his four months in prison, he then accused her of 'going on dates with Drake'. 

He added: 'I made it clear to the world who my girl was and and made your life equal to mine even at the cost of me not focusing on my career at times.

Full of love: Karrueche shared this snap accompanied by the caption 'my two baes' with Christina Milian 

'When this relationship first started u knew what it was and even participated in threesomes. I slowed all that s*** down.' 

Before dating Karrueche, Chris was in a relationship with singer Rihanna who he started dating in 2008.

On February 8, 2009, an argument in the Deuces singer's car ended with a physical altercation that left the then-20-year-old Bajan beauty hospitalised with multiple contusions to her face. 

Out and about: Karrueche, 26, was seen out with a friend in Studio City on Monday night

Chris, then just 19, turned himself in to police, where he was booked under suspicion of making criminal threats. 

He was charged with felony assault and making criminal threats, before pleading not guilty at his arraignment.

Forgiven: Chris was involved with singer Rihanna before his romance with Karreuche. They started dating in 2008, split in 2009 and briefly reunited in late 2012. They're seen at the 2013 Grammy Awards

On June 22, 2009, the star pleaded guilty to a felony and accepted a plea deal of community labor, five years' formal probation, and domestic violence counseling.

Chris started dating model Karreuche in 2011 before splitting up in late 2012 when he became romantically involved with Riri again. 

After the couple split in May 2013, Chris resumed his relationship with Karreuche.
