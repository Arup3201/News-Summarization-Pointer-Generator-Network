Outspoken: The presenter criticised women who delay having children and then turn to IVF as a 'lifestyle choice', saying it's not designed for families because they 'thought 30 was the new 20'

She caused outrage when she suggested girls should forgo university for babies.

And it appears Kirstie Allsopp has not quite finished fanning the flames of controversy when it comes to fertility and motherhood.

Yesterday the outspoken TV presenter criticised women who delay having children and then turn to IVF as a ‘lifestyle choice’.

The Location, Location, Location star made her comments in a new interview with Good Housekeeping in which she was asked about women over 35 wanting to start families.

She said: ‘I didn’t meet the right person until I was 32. I know that lots of people don’t meet the right person and lots of women are panicked and unhappy and sad about this. It’s not that I don’t understand that everyone comes to different things at different stages in life. But IVF is not a lifestyle choice. It’s a wonderful medical innovation which helps couples suffering from infertility, but it’s not designed to be done because you and your husband thought 30 was the new 20.’

The 43-year-old – who gave birth to her two sons at 35 and 37 – and has been in a relationship with property developer Ben Andersen for ten years, said she would urge her children to settle down and commit to producing offspring in their 20s rather than face having to pursue IVF.

She said: ‘“I would say ‘Darling you’re 27, your girlfriend is 27. You’ve just bought your first flat. Would you like me to help with the childcare?’Not all grandmothers are in that position, I realise that. But I want men to know that if you are in a committed relationship with someone at 30, saying I don’t want kids until we are 35 is not a loving thing to do. She is going to run the risk of having to pump drugs [from IVF] into her body.”

Miss Allsopp first raised the issue earlier this year in June when she urged young women to focus on finding a man and having a family before their fertility ‘falls off a cliff’ at 35.

She said at the time that it was time to speak ‘frankly’ about the matter, adding: ‘‘At the moment, women have 15 years to go to university, get their career on track, try and buy a home and have a baby.

‘That is a hell of a lot to ask someone. As a passionate feminist, I feel we have not been honest enough with women about this issue.

‘We have to readjust. Don’t go to university because it’s an “experience”. No, it’s where you’re supposed to learn something! Do it when you’re 50!’

Her comments attracted howls of outrage and saw her views branded antiquated - but Miss Allsopp remains unrepentant. In her latest interview, this time with Good Housekeeping magazine (subs, please keep credit) she is the first to admit she is no stranger to generating headlines.

Miss Allsopp, who is backing a Snowflake Appeal for family charity Home-Start said: ‘The problem is I’m my own worst enemy! If I wasn’t posh, didn’t wear skirts all the time, didn’t do all this homemaking stuff on the telly, then it would be OK for me to say these things. But if I wasn’t all of those things, then no one would be listening. So the controversy is in the perceived contradiction.’

Miss Allsopp and her sisters Sofie and Natasha share an increased risk of developing breast cancer – a disease their mother Lady Fiona Hindlip battled with for more than 25 years before passing away earlier this year.

In November 2010, Sofie, underwent a preventative double mastectomy to remove both her breasts, followed by reconstructive surgery, in order to reduce her cancer risk by 90 per cent. In contrast Kirstie, 41, has adopted a wait-and-see approach, preferring for now to go for regular breast scans and adopt a healthy lifestyle.

But Miss Allsopp admitted she is worried by her decision.

She said: ‘I’m going to feel bloody stupid if I do get breast cancer and I haven’t had that operation. But at the same time, one of the most important things about it is your personal fears. I am more of a worrier about other things, like should we [as a family] go in the car together or in different cars? Very idiotic and irrational, statistically. What I always worried about was the surgery, and I worry about the worrying of the surgery.”
