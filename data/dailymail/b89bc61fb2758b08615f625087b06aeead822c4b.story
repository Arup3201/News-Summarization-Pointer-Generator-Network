Not offended: Pontiff said he does not agree with Marxist ideology but has met 'good people' who do

Pope Francis said in a newspaper interview yesterday that he is not a Marxist but that even they can be good people.

Responding to conservative criticisms that his economic and social ideas smack of communism Francis also denied reports that he would name a woman cardinal.

Last month, American radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh, who has a huge following in the United States, railed against the pope for written comments made on the world economy.

Limbaugh, who is not Catholic, said that parts of the document were 'pure Marxism coming out of the mouth of the pope' and suggested that someone else had written the papal document for him.

He also accused the pope of going 'beyond Catholicism' and being 'purely political'.

Asked about the accusations, which sparked a debate in the media last month, Francis, a member of the all-male Jesuit order associated with progressive social policies, told La Stampa: 'Marxist ideology is wrong. But in my life I have known many Marxists who are good people, so I don’t feel offended.'

In last month’s document, seen as a platform for his papacy, Francis attacked unfettered capitalism as 'a new tyranny' said an 'economy of exclusion and inequality' had proven to be deadly for many people around the world.

In his response to the critics, Francis said he was not speaking 'as a technician but according to the social doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church, and this does not mean being Marxist'.

He said he was just trying to present a 'snapshot of what is happening' in the world today.

fugitive Edward Snowden into second place

Asked about speculation that a woman could be among the new cardinals he will appoint early next year, he said: 'I don’t know where that idea comes from. Women in the Church should be valued, not "clericalised".'

In another document last week, Francis said huge salaries and bonuses were symptoms of an economy based on greed and called again for nations to narrow the wealth gap.

Conservatives in the 1.2billion member Church have expressed concern and disappointment about some of the pope’s pronouncements, such as when he said he was not in a position to judge homosexuals who are people of good will sincerely seeking God.
