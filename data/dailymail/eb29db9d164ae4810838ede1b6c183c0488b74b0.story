It was well past 2am at Flushing Meadows and, before jumping in his car to head back to Manhattan, Boris Becker was animatedly demonstrating a forehand stroke to make his point.

His coaching client Novak Djokovic had just been pushed hard by Andy Murray on a raucous night in Queen’s but survived to make it into the semi-finals of the US Open.

Becker was speaking admiringly of how hard Murray had been hitting his forehand, but suggested it was that effort which lay behind his body stiffening up towards the end of the match. The remedy, he believes, is that this game style must be replicated every time the 27-year-old Scot walks on court, whoever the opponent.

Aggression: Boris Becker said that Andy Murray should keep up his aggressive style of play

‘The first two and a half sets Andy hit the ball as cleanly as I have seen him do it in a long time, he hit the forehand hard but maybe it took its toll,’ said Becker. ‘He is turning his body right round to hit the shot, and it’s made harder by Novak putting so much spin on the ball. It will become easier for Andy if he plays like this day in, day out.’

What Becker saw in the course of a 7-6, 6-7, 6-2, 6-4 defeat for Murray is that it will not be long before the Scot is back in the world’s top five.

‘The serve, forehand and backhand package was Andy at his very best until midway through the third set. I would expect him to have a good finish to the season on that evidence. There’s a good base for him to work from over the next six months. I think it is only a matter of time before he wins a tournament.’

Sidelines: Former Wimbledon champion Boris Becker is Novak Djokovic's current coach

What the German ex-Wimbledon champion had prophesied before the match — that Djokovic’s easier progress through the earlier rounds would be a factor — had come to pass. ‘Sooner or later you are going to play someone who is as good as you are, and you are going to need every bit of energy you have got to beat him,’ said Becker.

Afterwards Murray said he was a little disappointed about how his body reacted, given that he began training in Miami straight after Wimbledon. Djokovic observed that, in their matches, ‘I feel like there is a point where I feel I have that edge, you know, maybe physically’.

Sitting courtside it was indeed striking how, after long rallies of often brutal intensity, Murray’s chest would be heaving while his opponent would usually look ready to go again.

Defeat: Djokovic beat Murray in four sets at the US Open in Flushing Meadows

The Serb got married shortly after his Wimbledon win and his mediocre results in the events leading up to the US Open suggested that he had taken it easy for a considerable period. And yet, in the Grand Slam itself his fitness looks to have been restored to a supreme level.

Murray could hardly be more diligent about his physical conditioning, and will have to bring the same level of application to working on his second serve if he is to revisit the heights achieved when Ivan Lendl was his coach. His second delivery can sit up invitingly for the best returners to feast upon.

He was broken 20 times in five matches, and that is a major reason why there was less left in the tank when it came to the ultimate battle against Djokovic, who will now face No 10 seed Kei Nishikori in the last four. The Japanese came through his second five-set match in succession to beat Stanislas Wawrinka 3-6, 7-5, 7-6, 6-7, 6-4 and reach his first Grand Slam semi-final.

Form: Djokovic had been struggling for form before the US Open and had not seemed fully fit

Considering that Murray returned from back surgery in January, three Grand Slam quarter-finals and a semi-final is respectable and would be considered a dream scenario for all but the very best players.

This result leaves him at No 10 in the world, but that is sure to improve from here as he has no ranking points to defend from the corresponding period 12 months ago, when he was having the operation. 

He will need to perform strongly in the next two months otherwise he will miss out on the points bonanza that is the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals at the O2 Arena in November.

Rankings: After a brilliant 2012, Andy Murray slipped down the rankings to No 8 in the world

After a break at home he will play two ATP events in Asia, one of which will be in either Beijing or Tokyo and the other the Shanghai Masters. Then comes the Paris indoor event ahead of the season finale in London.

Murray said he will not add extra events just to try to make the field for the O2: ‘I don’t want to overplay. I’ll play the right schedule and just try to qualify.’

Given that what he is really lacking are the opportunities to register wins over top players you would have expected him to speak with more urgency. But it was very late, and Djokovic had ensured he was very tired.
