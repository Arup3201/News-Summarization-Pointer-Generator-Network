It was the biggest night in the British music calendar attracting the most glamorous of A-listers from Beyonce to Kate Moss.

From Laure Whitmore's sideboob to One Direction's dapper style, the
 Brit Awards 2014 saw our music industry give Los Angeles a 
run for their money in the style stakes.

But it takes a lot of work to look this fabulous.

She nailed it! Jessie J popped into the BRITs backstage spa, where Revlon nail supremo Jenny Longworth matched her nails to her lips

So for busy celebrities needing some last minute pampering the Brits now hosts 
its very own spa backstage offering head-to-toe treatments including 
spray tans, massages and five star facials.

And on Wednesday night BRIT Award 2014 nominees and 
presenters were beautified with a bevvy of brands in a spa tucked behind the main stage.

BODY...

First stop was the Organic Pharmacy, which offered stress level tests ahead of their performances and red carpet arrivals and helped Pharrell's backing dancers calm
 their nerves before the big event.

'This machine can tell us their vitamin and mineral deficiencies, hormone imbalances and free radical levels,' explained the head pharmacist.

'If the celebrities have high stress levels, which I presume they may on such a big night as this, we'll give them Holy Basil B Complex which is amazing for calming the body and supporting the adrenal glands all while giving a great energy boost,' she said.

Clearly the stars were in need of some last minute calming; 9,000 capsules and 1,200 minutes of stress tests followed.

Kylie Minogue also popped in for a 
pre-awards pick-me-up, and Ellie Goulding’s backing dancers and 
Pharrell’s choreographer were queuing for stress test appointments as 
awards adrenalin pumped, while Beyoncé’s lead backing singer - one of the brand’s cult followers - explained she was introduced to organic beauty brand by Queen Bey herself.

Rock on! Award winners Bastille popped into the V05 booth for a quick game of guitar hero

TAN...

Once the stars had been stress-checked, they were invited to have a spray tan by Vita Liberata - the non-toxic tanning brand loved by Kelly Brook.

Katy Perry's pal dashed in to grab a bottle of their instant Capture the Light tan before Katy hit the stage, Emeli Sande also grabbed a bottle and even presenter James Corden grabbed a bag of goodies just before the show started.

FACE...

The most popular pit-stop for the celebrities was the mini Decleor spa, which offered a Miracle Worker Facial to pep up fatigued skin, eye boosting treatments and mini massages.

Harry Styles summoned one of the 
therapists to his dressing room for a private massage (apparently he was
 extremely tense, but with his itinerary, who can blame him?).

'He
 was the nicest celebrity I have ever met,' masseur Fiona told us 'he 
was so sweet and has definitely been brought up very well.'

Harry also picked up some of the brand's 2 in 1 Dark Circle and Eye Wrinkle Eraser, which no doubt came in handy following the Sony after-party.

Aluna Francis from Aluna George, who 
surprised guests with a performance alongside Rudimental, stopped by for
 a head-to-toe ‘Miracle Worker’ facial to ensure her skin was perfectly 
polished and spotlight-ready.

Woody
 from BRIT award-winning band Bastille opted for a full head, neck and 
shoulder overhaul to ease tension before his performance, while 
Rudimental were treated to a quick booster treatment to revive and 
uplift in between rehearsals before letting off some steam playing 
Guitar Hero.

Beyonce's 
backing singers, The Mamas, who she formed eight years ago and have been
 with her ever since, also stopped by to pick up some face and eye 
creams ahead of their surprise performance.

Tending to the tresses of the stars was VO5's Aaron Carlo, who just so happens to be Little Mix's personal hairdresser.

'I have been in American with the girls a lot and I have given them tips on how to do their hair without me there while I'm back here,' he told us.

Aaron and his team hosted the ‘Style 
To The Beat’ bar where they created four music genre-inspired hair 
styles - Pop, Urban, Rock and Dance.

Aaron explained that Dance, a laid-back, wavy style, is the most popular.

'This
 season is all about hair that looks undone. Everyone is going for that 
cool, festival hair that just requires some texture spray for a beachy 
effect,' he said.

'If that's
 not your vibe, really sleek ponytails are going to be big. My best 
friend Lauren Pope has a great range for Rehab London of ones you can 
literally just stick onto your hair to create the effect really 
effortlessly.'

Keep calm and stop by: Clearly the stars were in need of some last minute calming - 9,000 capsules and 1,200 minutes of stress tests took place backstage

British presenters Laura Whitmore and Jo Wiley stocked up on freebies such as the Plump it Up Dry Backcomb Spray and Give Me Texture Tousled Styling Spray to keep their hair look freshly styled all night long.

One Direction's Zayn Malik walked away 
with a bundle of products for himself and his lady, Perrie Edwards, 
while Kylie Minogue, Jessie J and Nicole Scherzinger also pocketed some 
styling goodies.

'The hair product of the night was the 
Plump It Up Dry Backcomb Spray for the ladies and the Casual Texture 
Spray for the guys. Over 200 guests took the products away - they’re the
 perfect solutions to keeping your hair you styled to the beat all night
 long - no matter how hard you party!,' said Aaron.

Beautified: One Direction stopped by to pick up some Decleor products but sadly Harry didn't have time for a private massage like last year

NAILS...

Nails are one of the hottest accessories right now and Revlon's nail ambassador, Jenny Longworth, who has worked with the likes of Rihanna and backstage at the biggest fashion shows, was on hand to help create the trendiest talons.

Jenny created five musically 
inspired nail-art designs for some of the most popular era’s in musical 
history: 70’s Disco, 80’s Punk, 90’s Rave, 00’s Urban Pop and 00teens 
Electro Digital.

Jessie J popped by and was treated to a playful lilac manicure to compliment her embellished Julien Macdonald jumpsuit and lilac lips.

Beyonce’s backing singers The Mama’s, went for Jenny’s ‘80’s Punk’ look to complete their look for their show stopping performance with the lady herself.

Other celebrities that popped into the Brits Backstage Spa to pick up some Revlon treats were Nicole Scherzinger, Laura Whitmore and Becca Dudley, James Corden and band members for Bruno Mars, Pharrel Williams, Ellie Goulding and Rudimental. 

Want to get the look at home? Jenny explained: 'It is really simple. Just get some nail brushes from eBay, or use a toothpick to create the little dots and lines.

'This season is all about the pastels. From lilac to mint green, they're going to be hot news for nails. I also think we will see the return of the french manicure.

'If you don't have time to do your nails, a really nice, pristine buff will work wonders.'

Revlon also had a make-up artist on hand to touch up the star's make-up before they headed on stage or out to the after party and soft smokey eyes, dewy skin (very on-trend for SS14) and colour pop lips were the order of the day at the make-up station.
