A headteacher allegedly set up a threesome with a prostitute who he wanted to spank while she was dressed as a schoolgirl.

David Nicholson, 48, sent the woman explicit messages saying he was ‘keen’ on her dressing up like a pupil and was ‘looking forward to putting you over my knee’, it is claimed.

The married father-of-four is under investigation after apparently using his school email address to contact an £150-an-hour escort through an adult website and arrange a meeting with her and another woman.

Headteacher David Nicholson is accused of sending messages to a prostitute about spanking her when she is dressed up in school uniform as he allegedly organised a threesome with her and another woman

When one of them replied telling him she liked dressing up as a schoolgirl and being spanked, he allegedly responded: ‘I love this and would be keen.’

Mr Nicholson, who is headteacher of the 1,000-pupil Costello School in Basingstoke, Hampshire, allegedly organised a liaison in a hotel room on a night when he was due to be working away from home.

However, he was forced to call off the plan when the meeting he was using as a cover was cancelled. He promised to stay in touch with the women to set up a new date, it is claimed.

Governors at the academy school last night said they were investigating the allegations in The Sun newspaper. Mr Nicholson denies the claims.

Yesterday, the two prostitutes said they were shocked to discover what he did for a living. One of the women, aged 20, told The Sun: ‘He is a head and his fetish is spanking girls dressed in school uniforms, that’s quite scary. In his position he should be trusted.’

The other woman said: ‘If I had kids I wouldn’t want them to go to that school to be honest. What sort of family man is he? He should set an example.’

Mr Nicholson, who is training to be an Ofsted inspector, presents an image of himself as a loving and trustworthy man in postings on social media.

Mr Nicholson has worked as headteacher at The Costello School in Basingstoke since September last year 

He lives with his wife 15 years Karina, 43, a local councillor, and their children in the Wiltshire village of Great Bedwyn, which is surrounded by stunning countryside.

The Cambridge graduate moved to the Costello School last September, having previously worked as deputy and then headteacher at Abbeyfield School in Chippenham, Wiltshire.

Mr Nicholson is accused of sending messages to one of the escorts, showing his enthusiasm for one of them dressing up in school uniform and being spanked. He used his school email to send the imessages

On his Twitter account he describes himself as a ‘husband and father’.

In pictures posted online he is shown on his wedding day in July 2000 posing with Mrs Nicholson outside a local church before riding off from the service on a tandem bicycle.

After the prostitutes’ claims were published yesterday, Mr Nicholson said he was ‘mortified’ by the situation.

Governors at the Costello School said they had asked Mr Nicholson to leave the school site ‘immediately’ after allegations about his conduct surfaced. It was not clear if he had been officially suspended, but he will apparently not be allowed to return while an investigation is carried out.

Another member of staff has taken on the role of acting headteacher. Carol Bode, the chairman of the school’s board of governors, said: ‘I can assure you all that we are taking matters very seriously. We are following all necessary and correct procedures and as previously mentioned a full investigation is being undertaken by the governing body.

‘Our first priority at this time is for our students and their continuing education.’

But she refused to comment on whether the teacher would be given full pay or whether the school had paid for the hotel room he allegedly intended to use for a threesome.

Yesterday no one was available for comment at Mr and Mrs Nicholson’s £225,000 semi-detached home.

Mr Nicholson told The Sun: ‘I’m mortified by the allegations. I am disputing them. Until I know the full details of what is alleged I can’t comment further.’
