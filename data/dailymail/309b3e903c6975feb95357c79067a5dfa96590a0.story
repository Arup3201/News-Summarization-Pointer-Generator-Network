Victim: Sarah Payne was eight when she was murdered in July 2000

The mother of murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne is 'devastated' to learn that the News of the World may have hacked her mobile phone given to her by the editor Rebekah Brooks.

Sara Payne, who worked closely with the newspaper on its 'Sarah's Law' child protection campaign, has been told by detectives there is evidence she was targeted.

The phone was given to Mrs Payne by Mrs Brooks so that she could stay in touch with her supporters.

Today the Phoenix Chief Advocates group, which speaks out for the victims of paedophiles, said Sara was 'absolutely devastated' to hear she may have been targeted.

The campaigner was alerted by officers from Operation Weeting - as the Metropolitan Police's phone hacking inquiry is known.

The group, which is jointly run by Ms Payne, said in a statement: 'Whilst it was previously confirmed by 
Operation Weeting that Sara Payne's name was not on private investigator
Glenn Mulcaire's list, it has now been confirmed by the Operation 
Weeting that Sara's details are on his list.

'Sara is absolutely devastated by this news, we're all deeply disappointed and are just working to get her through it.'

Ms Payne became a tireless 
campaigner on child abuse issues after her eight-year-old daughter was 
murdered by paedophile Roy Whiting in 2000.

The mobile's number had been passed to private investigator Glenn Mulcaire, who hacked into hundreds of phones on behalf of the paper.

Mrs Payne’s eight-year-old daughter was abducted and killed by Whiting in July 2000. The NotW campaigned for 'Sarah’s Law’, the scheme which allows parents to check whether people with access to their children are child sex offenders.

The revelation that the paper may have hacked into a phone which was a gift to Mrs Payne marks a new low in the scandal.

In the past month it has emerged that the News of the World illegally accessed the voicemails of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, 7/7 victims’ relatives, and grieving military families.

Mrs Brooks said the latest allegations were ‘abhorrent’ and ‘particularly upsetting’ because Mrs Payne was a ‘dear friend’.

She said: ‘For the benefit of the campaign for Sarah’s Law, the News of the World have provided Sara with a mobile telephone for the last 11 years. It was not a personal gift.

‘The idea that anyone on the newspaper knew that Sara or the campaign team were targeted by Mr Mulcaire is unthinkable. The idea of her being targeted is beyond my comprehension.’

It is believed police have found evidence in files kept by Mulcaire which suggested he targeted Mrs Payne. Her mobile phone number and possibly a PIN were discovered in documents listing hundreds of potential hacking targets.

However, last night it was unclear whether there is any clear proof her phone was actually hacked. As part of their inquiries, detectives will want to establish who might have commissioned any hacking. It was also reported that Mrs Payne’s phone may not have had voicemail until 18 months ago.

Mrs Payne wrote a column for the final issue of the News of the World on July 10 when it was closed amid growing political and commercial pressure over the phone hacking scandal.

She wrote: ‘We did not meet under the best of circumstances. In fact, it was the worst, most horrendous time in my life. But from that moment on the News of the World and more importantly the people there became my very good and trusted friends. And like all good friends they have stuck with me through the good and the bad.’

Mrs Brooks has denied knowledge of phone hacking while she was editor of the NotW between 2000 and 2003. On July 15 she resigned as chief executive of News International and two days later was arrested and interviewed by police.

Earlier this month, after it emerged that Milly Dowler’s phone was hacked by the NotW, there was speculation that Mrs Payne might also have been a victim.

According to reports, detectives checked the names of Mrs Payne and her closest associates against its database of information contained in the notebooks, computer records and audio tapes seized from Mulcaire in August 2006. Nothing was found but in the past few days officers discovered her mobile number in notes kept by Mulcaire.

Last night Labour culture spokesman Ivan Lewis said: ‘This shocking news about the hacking of Sara Payne’s phone will ignite anger and revulsion across the country.

‘The newspaper which championed Sara’s campaign for Sarah’s Law invading her privacy in such a cruel way raises further serious questions about what was happening at the News of the World on Rebekah Brooks’s watch.’

BSkyB has given chairman James Murdoch it's full backing after his role at the satellite broadcaster came under pressure in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal.

The FTSE 100 Index company said Mr Murdoch, pictured, would remain as chairman as it revealed a 23 per cent hike in annual operating profits to £1.1billion - rubbing salt in the wounds of News Corporation, which earlier this month withdrew its bid for total control of the company.

The company also announced a partnership with the BBC to broadcast live Formula 1 between 2012 and 2018, in a move which will see Sky Sports show all races while the BBC have just half the races live.

Mr Murdoch junior, deputy chief operating officer at News Corp, had faced calls for his resignation as BSkyB chairman from MPs, shareholder groups and industry figures as the phone-hacking scandal unfolded.

The revelations led to News Corp pulling its bid for the 61per cent of the broadcaster it does not already own.

Today's annual results laid bare the appeal of BSkyB to News Corp as the company revealed a 16per cent surge in annual revenue to £6.6billion and net growth of 71,000 customers between April and June.
