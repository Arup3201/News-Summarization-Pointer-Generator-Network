Three South Florida attorneys will represent a man accused of killing his wife and then posting pictures of her body on Facebook.

A judge on Friday approved a request for preservation of evidence in the case against 31-year-old Derek Medina. The attorneys took over from the Public Defender's Office, which initially represented Medina.

Authorities say Medina posted a Facebook status on August 8 in which he confessed to killing 26-year-old Jennifer Alfonso. Moments later, a gruesome photo appeared on the page of a woman slumped on the floor. Medina later told police he had gotten into an argument with Alfonso that day.

Prisoner: Derek Medina, who is charged with murder in the death of his wife Jennifer Alfonso, reported to court for a hearing on Friday

Defense: Medina consults with a lawyer at a court appearance in Miami

Medina sat silently in court at Friday's hearing, wearing a red jumpsuit and shackles around his wrists and ankles.

According to the Miami Herald, it's likely the preservation of evidence order is to allow Medina's lawyers to photograph markings such as cuts and bruises on Medina's body.

It is presumed Medina will claim the killing was in self-defense.

Medina
 is facing charges of first-degree murder after he posted a message on 
his personal Facebook account Thursday morning, allegedly admitting to 
the murder of his wife.

'Im
 going to prison or death sentence for killing my wife love you guys 
miss you guys take care Facebook people you will see me in the news,' he
 wrote.

'My wife was punching me and I am not going to stand anymore with the abuse so I did what I did I hope u understand me.'

Medina
 posted the photo apparently showing his murdered spouse lying in the 
kitchen with blood covering her face and left arm with the comment: 'Rip
 Jennifer Alfonso.'

He later told police that he shot Ms Alfonso several times after she picked up a kitchen knife, and punched and kicked him.

In
 his affidavit, Medina said he had pointed a gun at his wife as they 
argued in their bedroom. Later he confronted his wife, who said he was 
leaving him, in their kitchen, according to CBS News.

The
 affidavit claims Ms Alfonso started to hit him so he went back upstairs
 for the gun, as his wife reached for a kitchen knife. 

He told police he disarmed his wife but when she started to punch him again he shot her several times.

Medina's father, Derek, to whom he confessed to shortly after the shooting, told the Miami Herald: 'They are making my son out to be a 
monster and it was the other way around. She pushed him to the point of insanity.'

The victim's family however, described Medina as controlling, claiming that he pressured her to leave her job.

One man, who would give his name only 
as Joe, said Medina was prone to violent outbursts.

He claimed he once 
saw Medina threaten a woman with a gun after she accidentally spilled 
beer, and said Medina used to stalk members of a softball team they both
 played on.

Medina was denied bail by a Miami-Dade Circuit Court judge.

MailOnline chose to obscure the Facebook image due to its extremely graphic and disturbing nature.

Medina's post and shocking photo of his 
murdered wife remained on Facebook for five hours before his profile was
 taken down just before 5pm Thursday.

Officers who were dispatched to the couple's home at 5555 SW 67th Avenue discovered Ms Alfonso's body.

The

 woman in the picture was bent over backwards at the knees wearing black
 leggings, with her head in the corner of what appears to be a kitchen.

The unsettling post left several of Medina's friends puzzled, asking him what happened.

Kayla Amando Pabon wrote about the woman in the grisly image: 'That is my friend there.' 

Medina was a part-time extra on the USA 
Network show Burn Notice.

The
 wannabe star boasted online about his tiny bit-part appearances and 
dreamed of fame that he never quite attained. He appeared only as a 
backgound extra with his head-shaved and pouting in two episodes in 
2010.

However, that didn't stop him talking up his achievements.

Posting
 a video on YouTube, he narrated: 'Put on USA, I’m coming out on the 
episode right now. I’m on USA. I’m going to come out soon. This is the 
episode that I filmed. That’s me right there! You saw me?'

Concerns: The unsettling post left several of Medina's friends puzzled, asking him for an explanation of what happened

The page also has a clip of a man kicking a punching bag in a gym. 

In an interview with the local station WSVN, Medina's father, Derek Medina Sr., said that his son came to him at around 11am Thursday and admitted to shooting his wife.

‘He just said that his wife picked up a knife on him, and they had a big fight, and he shot her,’ said the father.

The elder Medina drove his son to a South Miami police station, where the 31-year-old turned himself in.

Derek
 Medina Sr. said that the girl who was removed from the apartment wrapped in a
 blanket is Ms Alfonso’s daughter from a previous relationship.

According
 to the father, his son had a rocky relationship with Ms Alfonso. He 
said that the two got a divorce after being married for three years, but
 remarried again last year.

Tragic twist: when police arrived at the couple's home, they found Alfonso's 10-year-old daughter and led her out wrapped in a blanket

Ms Alfonso listed her occupation as a server at Denny's. Records show that she married Medina in April 2012.

The
 woman was last active on Facebook on Wednesday, about 15 hours before 
the image of her body appeared on her husband's page. At the time, 
Alfonso changed her profile picture to a photo of her kissing Medina.

Miami New Times reported
 that Medina has published a number of self-help e-books, among them one
 titled: 'How I Saved Someone's Life and Marriage and Family Problems 
Thru Communication.'

His 
works, mostly bearing odd and lengthy titles, are available through the 
site e-junkie priced between $9.99 and $11.99. At least one is out in 
paperback selling for $19.99.

His latest offering is World Just Ask Yourself Why We Are Living a Life Full of Lies and How I an Emotional Writer Made All of My Professional Dreams Come True Blocking Society's Teachings.

In a summary of one book, Medina claims he can hunt ghosts and at one time saved his wife from a poltergeist attack while they were in New York.

Elsewhere in his writings, Medina talked about his experiences with aliens and lamented that humans are not working on a time travel machine needed for an 'evacuation plan.'

Medina is due back in court at the end of August to face arraignment.
