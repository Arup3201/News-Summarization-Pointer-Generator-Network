A large gas grill exploded at a church barbecue on Monday, killing a man operating it at the time, authorities said.

The victim was identified as Doug Gripp, 52, of Carmel, Indiana, a married father of two young daughters.

The explosion at Grace Community Church in Noblesville was felt by others preparing for a cookout, Police Lt. Bruce Barnes said. The cause of the blast was not immediately known.

'We're still looking into the reasons as 
to why. We're not going to have the answers today, tomorrow or maybe 
even the weeks to come,' Lt Barnes said.

Senior Pastor Dave Rodriguez said the victim was a 'very beloved volunteer' in the men's ministry.

'We're in shock,' Mr Rodriguez added.

The pastor described the grill as being larger than ones typically found at homes. He said it was owned by Mr Gripp.

The church draws about 5,000 worshippers each week, he said. Noblesville is about 20 miles northeast of Indianapolis.

About 400 men were expected to attend the cookout, which was canceled after the explosion, Rodriguez said.

The pastor wrote on the church's website: 'Doug was a committed Men of Grace volunteer and a member of the Covenant
 Community, the membership body of Grace.

This is an unbelievably heart-wrenching situation, and we don’t understand why it happened.

'What we do know is that even in the darkest and most confusing circumstances, God loves us, and He is with us. Together with Doug’s family, we desperately cling to these truths in prayer and faith.'

It was the second tragedy to rock a central Indiana church in less than a month.

A bus owned by Colonial Hills Baptist Church in Indianapolis crashed exiting a highway July 27, killing a youth pastor, his wife and a third member of that congregation.
