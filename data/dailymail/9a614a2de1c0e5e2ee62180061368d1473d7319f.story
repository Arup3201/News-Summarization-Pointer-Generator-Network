A senior California-based lawyer has become a social media star after starring in a music video in which he raps about putting an end to domestic violence and child abuse. 

Darryl Snider, from Rancho Palos Verdes, Los Angeles, wrote and produced the catchy rap hit Treat All Women With Respect for the video, which was released through his own production company DaddyDaDa Productions.

The video itself, despite its dated content and low-budget production, has thus far received just over 350,000 hits on YouTube, turning Mr Snider AKA DaddyDaDa into an unlikely internet celebrity.

Rap sensation: Darryl Snider AKA DaddyDaDa has turned into an overnight celebrity thanks to his bizarre music video Treat All Women With Respect

Positive message: The California-based lawyer is trying to put an end to domestic violence and child abuse

Clad in a retro-inspired leather jacket and backwards black cap, Mr Snider speaks out to men of all ages through his 'meaningful' rap song, encouraging them to step up to their responsibilities as a father, husband, boyfriend or son. 

'Step to the plate and be a man,' he raps. 'Never hit a woman - or abuse a child. It’s just wrong - and illegal too. Someday it will catch up with you.'

Mr Snider performs with an enthusiastic back-up band, which includes a drummer, singer, and a keyboard player turned flutist, and dances along to the music with complete confidence, as clips of different couples and families are flashed up on screen to illustrate his song.

From a young man who shakes his girlfriend during an argument, to a father worrying about supporting his family, the clips display a variety of different situations in which domestic violence is present.

Co-stars: The rapper stars in the video alongside a talented band, including this musician who showcases both his keyboard and flute playing abilities

Stay in school: Mr Snider encourages all young people to focus on their education

'It's just odd': While the video has proved immensely popular on social media, some have questioned its rather bizarre content

Mr Snider also encourages anyone who has been affected by domestic violence or abuse, whether as a victim or an instigator, to try and turn their life around by focusing on their families and their education.

'Men, Women, Kids - take pride and have hope,' he urges. 'You have a bright future - and that’s the real dope. There’s redemption out there - just waiting for you, get an education and work hard too.'

Although popular in terms of viewing figures, the video has divided opinion among online critics, some of whom are baffled by its content - and by its star.

'I think this is my cue for leaving the internet for a day or two,' one person commented on the video, while another added: 'You can't argue that this isn't a good message, it's just sorta odd, he's not really rapping just more like talking...'

Others, however, have praised the senior citizen for being brave enough to put across such an important message.

'I appreciate that you are putting yourself out there to try to spread a positive message,' Heather Bartels wrote. 'Try to ignore all of the losers who have nothing in their lives better than posting hateful comments; their punishment is having to live their pathetic lives.'

Support act: The video also features appearances from a variety of actors - and even a dance troupe

Go straight to jail: The song warns that domestic violence is likely to land you in prison

Fight the power: In the music video, women are seen taking charge and standing up against bullies

One, two, three, four: Mr Snider insists that there should be no more women on the floor

But, while the lawyer-turned-musician is no doubt enjoying his five minutes of fame, he is eager to ensure that the important message in his music video not be forgotten.

'This video was created to help get the message out that it's time to bring an end to domestic violence and sexual assault,' the YouTube description explains.

And, having experienced such success with his first hit, Mr Snider is determined to capitalize on his five minutes of fame - and has already launched a Kickstarter page in order to fund the next DaddyDaDa hit. 

'DaddyDaDa Productions is starting its second music video titled "What on earth is happening?"' he writes on the page.

'This new music video will likely be done in positive rap (hip hop) or pop rock and explore current social issues, including further increasing public awareness of the need to stop domestic violence and abuse of women and children. 

'The new project will also explore some basic questions about how we think, and how we treat our neighbors and friends in this day and age.' 

One, two, three four

No more women on the floor

 

Treat all women with respect

What you give, is what you get

Treat all women with respect, I say

 

Heads up guys - I’m talking to you,

Life’s not easy – so what ya gonna do?

Step to the plate and be a man

Never hit a woman - or abuse a child

It’s just wrong - and illegal too

Someday it will catch up with you

Times have changed - domestic violence

Will no longer go down - and be silenced

 

Use your mind – not your fist

True love - is full of bliss

Keep your job - stay out of jail

Control your anger - no more bail

 

Treat all women with respect

What you give, is what you get

Treat all women with respect, I say

 

Don’t be a baby daddy and walk away

Be a Father - it’s okay to stay

If you father a child, it’s just the beginning,

With child and mother in your life, that is winning

Bond with your child and lead the right way. 

Give them your love - give them your time.

Set a good example and share your life

Reverse the vicious cycle - of abandonment, abuse

Know your child, love your child and provide

She might be the next - Beyonce or Sally Ride…..

 

Treat all women with respect

What you give, is what you get

Treat all women with respect, I say

 

One, two, three, four

No more women on the flooooor…

 

Now ladies out there - let me talk to you,

It’s okay to say no to men and still be cool

Stand up for yourself - and then decide

What you gonna do - with your own life?

Use your brain and finish school,

Don’t fall for a guy - who acts like a fool

Is he the kind of man’s - gonna care for you?

Too many women - have their innocence stolen

Repeating a cycle - that must be broken

Respect yourself and leave a man who strikes

Find a good man - who will treat you right!

 

One, two, three, four

No more women on the floor

 

Men, Women, Kids - take pride and have hope,

You have a bright future - and that’s the real dope

There’s redemption out there - just waiting for you

Get an education and work hard too

We must change our ways - and see the light

It’s what we make of ourselves - each day and night

Stay together, pray together - and everyone scream

Work together - take pride - and join the team!

 

Treat all women with respect

What you give, is what you get

Treat all women with respect, I say

 

Treat all women with respect

What you give, is what you get

Treat all women with respect, I say

 

Treat all women with respect

What you give is what you get

Treat all women with respect, I say

 

One two, three, four

No more women on the floor!
