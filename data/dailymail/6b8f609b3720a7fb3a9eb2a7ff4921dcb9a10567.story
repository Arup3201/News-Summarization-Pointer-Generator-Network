It’s one way to guarantee a white Christmas – but as it requires a £20,000 investment and nine months of preparation, it might be easier just to jet off to Lapland.

Paul Toole has transformed his bungalow into a winter wonderland, complete with quarter of a mile of fake snow and 50,000 fairy lights which flash in time to his own radio channel.

Visitors to his cul-de-sac in Wells, Somerset, are invited to tune in to his station, which plays 11 festive tracks on a loop while a Father Christmas figurine in his garden moves to the beat of each song.

Twinkling lights: Paul Toole has spent a huge £20,000 on his illuminations and attracts 100 visitors every night

Completely crackers! Mr Toole decorates his bungalow with 50,000 Christmas lights

Lights... action: Mr Toole puts the finishing touches to his display, which he began putting up on October 24

Up to 100 guests each night arrive to
view the spectacle, which includes a 20ft Christmas tree, an 
illuminated waterfall and glowing polar bears, seals and reindeer.

Mr 
Toole, 36, who runs karaoke nights, begins preparations for each year’s 
display in March. 

He said: 'Walking into our street is quite magical at Christmas. Some people say it makes them feel cold, it is very Arctic.

‘Our bungalow has been nicknamed “the house on Christmas 
Street”. I think about it and plan it every single day of the year.

‘I am slightly wacky about Christmas and I am constantly trying to think of ways I can make our display the biggest and best.’

Mr Toole estimates that this year’s display will add around £150 to his 
electricity bill – but the money  thrown into the wishing well in his 
garden is given to charity.

He has spent £20,000 collecting the illuminations since 1998, when he started with two strings of lights in 1998.

Magical: The display boasts penguins, polar bears, a ferris wheel and 400 metres of fake snow

Celebrities John Challis, who played Boycie in Only Fools and Horses, and American singer Judy Pancoast 
visited the close for the big switch-on yesterday.

Mr Toole added: 'Our
street looks good in the day as well as at night. You can sit in your 
car and enjoy the music on your radio, or come out as we have speakers 
playing Christmas tunes.

'It really looks fantastic, I feel very proud of it this year.'

More than 1,000 people turned out for the switch-on,held in aid of the Make a Wish foundation, and were each given a mince pie from a local bakery. A team from Starbucks also handed out free drinks.

Mr Toole has spent a staggering 264 hours synching his lights to his radio 
station and the Father Christmas figure - as one minute of music takes 
eight hours to sequence.

The House on Christmas Street: Visitors flock to see the display, which will be on show from 1 December to 5 January

He began putting up the 
decorations on October 24, and his house and garden are covered with 400
metres of polyester wadding which looks like a blanket of snow.

He was inspired to create a 'House on Christmas Street' after visiting New
Hampshire in the U.S. where homeowners deck out their properties with 
thousands of festive lights.

He
returned home with just two sets of lights and put them on his mother's
bungalow. The lights stopped working a few years later and he began 
stocking up on UK-made decorations.

A donation wishing well is left at the front of the display - which attracts up to 100 cars a night.

Mr Toole's radio station, 89.2FM, is broadcast 
from a transmitter a few hundred yards from his home between 5pm and 
9.30pm from December 1 until January 5.

He said: 'I am absolutely thrilled by what we have created and it
is worth every penny.'

David Cameron appeared to be rather less filled with festive spirit than our merry bungalow owner.

While Paul Toole brings glad tidings to all his neighbours, the Prime Minister had kept the best tree on the block for himself.

The bushy fir outside No 10 was laden with huge shining baubles and delicate blue lights, but the Norwegian evergreen in nearby Trafalgar Square was looking decidedly crooked.

Sad tidings: The famous tree that appears annually in London's Trafalgar Square looks crooked and plainly decorated

Festive joy: But David Cameron, joined by Blue Peter badge holders and presenter Helen Skelton, has a beautiful fir over in Downing Street

Tourists in Central London were rather surprised to discover the traditional Norwegian tree looking extremely ragged.

The tall, skinny centrepiece is decorated carelessly with vertical strips of harsh green lights and a stark bulb on the top.

Mr Cameron turned on the lights on in Downing Street with presenter Helen Skelton and a group of young Blue Peter gold badge holders - but the public in Trafalgar Square were left out in the cold.

It will be a real a disappointment for children who visit the London landmark in the hope of seeing the most impressive festive scene of the season.

The Trafalgar Square Christmas Tree is the City of Oslo's traditional Christmas gift to the City of Westminster as a token of thanks for British support during the years of occupation. 

Perhaps our Prime Minister could demonstrate equal Christmas spirit in his own country.

Christmas cheer: The magnificent sight outside No 10 is the perfect winter spectacle, with its tasteful colour scheme of silver and white
