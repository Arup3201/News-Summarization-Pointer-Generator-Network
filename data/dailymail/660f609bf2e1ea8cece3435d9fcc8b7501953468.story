Disgusted: Mother Wendy Gibbons, 39, from Sunderland, was shocked to find someone posted a fake profile of her on a swingers' website

A mother-of-four was horrified when she found out she had been placed on a swingers website without her knowledge.

Wendy Gibbons, 39, only found out about the advert on fabswingers.com when a complete stranger contacted her using details posted on the website.

The mother from Sunderland then discovered that someone had set up a fake profile in Ms Gibbons' name using her description, name and real address to find sexual encounters.

The advert also claimed that she loved 'dressing up in leather clothing' and that her interests included adult parties, blindfolds, threesomes, webcams amongst other details.

Ms Gibbons, who is mum to three girls aged four to ten, says the has been left feeling unsafe in her own home and fears for the safety of her children.

She added: 'I only found out because this man contacted me on Facebook. I had no idea who he was or how he knew where I lived.

'He said I had posted my Facebook account on a swingers website asking for people to get in touch with me for sex.

'He provided me a link to a swingers website for me to look at. I was mortified when I went on the site and saw the profile and contacted the police straight away.

'I was absolutely shocked, it even put my home address on the profile, pretending it was me.

'It’s disgusting. I was scared to let the kids play outside as I didn’t know who had been given my address.

'It’s unbelievable what they are doing on this site, it’s sick.

'This man getting in touch with me could have been anyone and he could have attacked me in my home in front of my children.

'Even though he found out I knew nothing about it, he was still asking me if I was single and pursuing me. He would ask me if I was in the house.'

'Fun, free and fabulous': Fabswingers.com acts like a social networking website for swingers interested in casual sex

Fab Swingers is a website covering the UK and U.S.A, which describes itself as 'fun, free and fabulous'.

It acts like a social networking site for casual sex, in which users can upload profiles based on their sexual preferences and can post status updates.

Ms Gibbons' said police traced the IP address of the fake profile to an address in Sunderland. Two arrests were made but no further action has been taken.

She continued: 'I don’t understand how paedophiles have their computers taken off them if indecent images are found, yet nothing is done about this.

'My profile has been taken down, but the website is still running.

'It must have been people who know me who set it up. If someone can do that once, they can do it again to someone else.

'It’s the fact that my address was given out that really concerns me - anyone could be watching.'
