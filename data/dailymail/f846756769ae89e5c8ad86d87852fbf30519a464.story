A 95-year-old woman asked to remove her adult diaper by TSA agents has spoken for the first time about her embarrassing ordeal.

Lena Reppert, who is in the final stages of a battle with leukaemia was detained and 
humiliatingly searched at a Florida airport while in a wheelchair - but, remarkably, says she is 'too old to care'.

Her daughter Jean Weber, claims Mrs Reppert was asked to remove an adult diaper in order to complete a pat-down search after TSA agents felt something soggy around her thigh area.

Stunned: Mrs Reppert's daughter was angry at TSA for what she called an unnecessary search

Speaking to 24 Hour News 8, Mrs Reppert said TSA agents took her into an examination room.

She said: 'That's when they took my pants.

'They do a really good job of patting you down. They really give you a physical exam, almost.'

'I guess it bothered my daughter more than it did me. I guess I’m too old to care.

'I didn’t let it bother me for some reason.

'It was an episode of embarrassment, so to speak, but then I got on the plane OK, and after that everything was OK.

'When I get on the plane, I don’t want anyone on there that has got something in their pockets, like a knife or a gun or whatever.'

Jean Weber claims her leukaemia-stricken mother, 95, was made to take off her adult diaper by airport security in Florida, who are standing by their actions

Ms Reppert was trying to board a plane to fly to Michigan in an attempt to be with relatives as she battles the disease, Ms Weber said.

Her mother entered security in a wheelchair because she could not walk through by herself and was detained for 45 minutes.

But Ms Reppert was pulled aside into a separate area and patted down before being moved to another room to protect her privacy.

Security
staff then said they needed her diaper removed because it was soiled 
and was preventing them from completing their search.

Ms
Weber, who removed her mother's diaper in a bathroom for her, said she 
did not understand why her mother had such an extensive search.

Speaking to the station she said: 'They took excessive measures.'

When asked what sort of threat her mother may have posed, she added: 'Can't 
think of anything really.

'I really can't.'

Ms Weber has filed a complaint with the Department of Homeland Security after the incident last weekend at Northwest Florida Regional Airport.

‘It’s something I couldn’t imagine happening on American soil,’ she told the Northwest Florida Daily News.

‘Here is my mother, 95-years-old, 105lbs, barely able to stand, and then this.’

Despite outrage over the incident, the TSA released a statement defending its agents' actions in the search.

'While every person and item must be screened before entering the secure boarding area, TSA works with passengers to resolve security alarms in a respectful and sensitive manner,' the TSA said.

'We have reviewed the circumstances involving this screening and determined that our officers acted professionally and according to proper procedure.'

A TSA spokesman told the Northwest Florida Daily News it would be dangerous for them to exempt any group from screening.

‘We know from intelligence that there are terrorists out there that would then exploit that vulnerability,’ a TSA spokesman said.

Wheelchairs are swabbed for explosives and patted-down, the spokesman said.
