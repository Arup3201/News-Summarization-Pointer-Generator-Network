Workers in Britain face a ‘lost decade’ of falling pay as wages rise slower than prices, according to a report.

Average earnings will be more than £1,000, or five per cent lower in 2017 than they were in 2008 once inflation has been taken into account.

The figures, put together by economic forecasters the Ernst & Young Item Club, highlight the so-called ‘cost-of-living crisis’ gripping families across the country in the aftermath of the financial crash.

Average earnings will be more than £1,000, or five per cent lower in 2017 than they were in 2008 once inflation has been taken into account, according to the Ernst & Young Item Club

The Item Club analysis shows that take-home pay for the average worker was £18,852 in 2008. After inflation has been taken into account, it fell to £17,713 last year and is expected to drop to £17,611 this year before edging up to £17,827 in 2017.

But that is still £1,025, or 5.4 per cent lower, than in 2008, leaving British families worse off than they were before the crisis struck.

The report comes at a particularly sensitive time during the final party conference season before the General Election in May, with living standards set to be a major issue between now and polling day.

Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the Item Club, said: ‘Households are facing a lost decade of real wage growth which will mean consumer spending growth will be low by historic standards

‘Total household incomes have strengthened because more people are in work but individuals do not have extra money in their pockets.

‘We expect this trend to continue for several years to come and it will be mirrored with a slowdown in consumer spending growth.’

Workers across a wide range of incomes are feeling the pain, according to the report. Those in the bottom 10 per cent will have seen take-home pay fall from £7,361 in 2008 to £7,077 in 2017, while those in the top 10 per cent will have seen earnings drop from £37,735 to £35,632.

Mr Beck added: ‘The squeezed middle is also going to continue to struggle, as limited growth in disposable incomes, reflecting weak pay rises and the threat of jobs being automated, leaves them no choice but to remain frugal with spending.’

A separate report by the Centre for Policy Studies shows the cost-of-living crisis started under the last Labour government in 2007.

Economist Tim Morgan, who wrote the report, said: ‘It would be disingenuous to blame this cost of living crisis on the Coalition, since the decline in real living standards clearly began earlier.’

And Tim Knox, director of the Centre for Policy Studies, said: ‘The deterioration in living standards is a clear consequence of Labour’s mismanagement of the economy.

‘But if Ronald Reagan’s famous question – “Are you better off than you were four years ago” – were to be asked today, the answer for most people in Britain would be “No”. Coupled with the fragility of economic recovery, the Coalition must resist the temptation to be complacent. Much more needs to be done.’
