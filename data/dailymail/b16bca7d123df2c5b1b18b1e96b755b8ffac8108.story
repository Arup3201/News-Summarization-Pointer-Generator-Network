Involved? Samantha Lewthwaite, of Aylesbury, is seen in a newly-released photo from her school days

A former classmate of 'White Widow' Samantha Lewthwaite said she became obsessed with Islam as a teenager at school.

The unnamed classmate alleged that 29-year-old Lewthwaite - who is rumoured to have had a
hand in the terrorist attacks on the Westgate mall in Kenya - was known 
to be fixated on the religion even as a pupil.

It also emerged today that neighbours have said her father is appalled by the idea that his daughter may have masterminded the massacre.

Former soldier Andy Lewthwaite came face to face with the toll of terror attacks when he served in Northern Ireland at the height of the Troubles in the 1970s.

Now he is struggling to come to terms with allegations that his daughter - already the world's most wanted woman - was behind the attack that has killed more than 60 people in Westgate shopping centre in Nairobi.

A neighbour told the Daily Mirror: 'Andy is aware of how appalling indiscriminate shootings are. For him to imagine his own daughter is involved in this is very painful.

'He has been very dignified... his daughter is apparently tarnishing both his reputation and his country's reputation.'

Although there is 
no evidence which proves Lewthwaite was involved in the horrific attacks
in Nairobi which left dozens dead, Kenya's foreign 
minister has said a British woman was among the Islamist assailants.

And
yesterday a woman who was inside the shopping centre said she locked 
eyes with an AK-47-wielding ‘pale-skinned woman’ with long dark hair – 
the same as British Muslim convert Lewthwaite – as she opened fire from a
balcony.

Amazingly, the woman, who gave her name only as Caroline, escaped unharmed as Islamists stormed the Westgate shopping centre.

Enthusiast: Now schoolmates from Buckinghamshire have said Lewthwaite was involved with Islam in her schooldays

She
said: ‘She was high up but not far from me, close enough that I saw her
looking along the floor where I was until she saw me.

‘She stopped and aimed at me and then opened fire. All of the bullets did not hit me, I don’t know how that happened.

‘She
stopped firing at me for a moment and looked away and I jumped up and 
ran around a corner and that’s how I escaped.

‘She had 
pale skin and long black hair, and was wearing a baggy black top. I 
can’t remember very much, but I remember she had pale skin.’

A 
senior Kenyan anti-terror officer last night revealed that police had 
received many witness accounts of a female attacker resembling the widow
of 7/7 bomber Jermaine Lindsay.

He added: ‘We believe that she 
was involved in the attack. We cannot doubt the eyewitnesses who say 
they saw her commanding the attackers.’

Kenya foreign minister Amina Mohamed added: ‘The Briton was a woman... who has done this many times before.’

A
Twitter account thought to belong to the militant group al-Shabaab, 
which tweeted their cruel attack, also claimed that Lewthwaite 
‘commanded’ the attack.

A post said: ‘We have 
received permission to disclose the involvement of Samantha Lewthwaite 
aka sherafiyah [her Islamic name], she successfully overseered [sic] the
mission.’

British security officials say they have yet to 
receive confirmation from the Kenyan authorities of Lewthwaite’s role in
the attack, but they would not be ‘entirely surprised’ if she is 
involved.

The classmate, who knew Lewthwaite in her days at The 
Grange School in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, in the late 1990s said she was a model 
student who was popular with teachers.

The man, who was in the 
same Religious Education class as her, said: 'From when I first met her 
she was interested in the religion, she knew a lot about it.

'She never mentioned anything about converting to me but I think it was where everyone knew she was going.

'I
think certain people can be easily brainwashed. With her home situation
and her parents breaking up, she probably needed something to cling on 
to and she's gone down the wrong side.'

In court: Lewthwaite has been on the run since police foiled her bomb plot in Mombasa, Kenya, in 2011. Yesterday, the trial for her British accomplice in this plot, Jermaine Grant (pictured), began in Mombasa

But despite this, he 
added that: 'She was always really helpful and never in trouble - she 
was always helping out with the teachers, staying late to do stuff.

'When it all came out about the terror links you thought "OK she converted because she has a keen interest in the religion".

The revelation came as African media 
reported that Lewthwaite had been renting property in Kenya under the 
alias Natalie Faye Webb, and had run up debts of more than £6,000.

According
to credit records released by a tv news network, she was listed as living in the 
city's predominantly South Asian neighbourhood of Mayfair for four 
years.

It
emerged yesterday that Lewthwaite’s grandmother, 85-year-old Ellen 
Allen, was rushed to hospital in Banbridge, Northern Ireland after 
collapsing from the stress of her granddaughter’s notoriety.

Lewthwaite
has been on the run since police foiled her bomb plot targeting Western
hotels and a shopping mall in the Kenyan coastal resort of Mombasa in 
December 2011.

Yesterday, the trial for her British accomplice in this plot, Jermaine Grant, began in Mombasa.

Scotland
Yard anti-terror officers gave evidence for the first time, describing 
the chemicals found at their make-shift bomb factory.

As 
mother-of-four Lewthwaite’s relatives in the UK maintained a wall of 
silence, a former police detective told the Mail he was ‘not surprised’ 
to learn of her suspected role in the attack.

Noel Hogan, who 
interviewed the former grammar school pupil shortly before the July 7 
bombings, said: ‘If Samantha is involved, it does not surprise me.’

Mr
Hogan was hired by a bank to investigate why their customer, 
Lewthwaite’s husband Lindsay, had spent £900 on dozens of bottles of 
perfume over a matter of days.

The suspicious purchases were made just days before the July 7 bombings and were used to make the homemade explosives.

As
part of his agency’s investigation, they spoke to Lewthwaite four 
times. Mr Hogan said: ‘On each occasion it was noted that her stories 
were inconsistent and her demeanour was unusual.

‘We didn’t consider her a particularly honest individual.’

Yet
those who knew Lewthwaite from her hometown of Aylesbury expressed 
surprise at her role as one of Al Shabaab’s key financiers and 
bomb-making tutors.

Councillor Raj Khan said: ‘She was an 
average, British, young, ordinary girl. She didn’t have very good 
confidence. There was nothing that made me worried about her.’

Lewthwaite was seven months pregnant when her husband blew himself up, killing 26 people.
