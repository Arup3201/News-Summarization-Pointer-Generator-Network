It looks like the definition of paradise, high in the sky, surrounded by luscious green branches, with the sun glowing softly and nothing but clear blue water down beneath.

But clad in nothing but a pair of Speedos, faced with a 27-metre tumble from a crumbling cliff, many would think twice about that.

Not these men.

Paradise: Phi Phi Island in southern Thailand has hosted the final round of the sixth annual cliff diving championship, where the men have just three seconds to perform

Eagerly bounding to the cliff-edge on Phi Phi Island in Thailand, 14 divers flung themselves, twisting and turning at break neck speed towards life-threatening rocks.

Their one shared objective: make it look good.

Gathered for the sixth round of the sixth annual Red Bull cliff diving championship series today, they have all spent months preparing their moves.

There is no hard-and-fast rule for the game - just the mantra, 'power and balance'.

But with just three seconds between leaving the podium and hitting the Andaman Sea, they don't have long to show off their best.

This year the series has taken the competitors all over the world.

Warriors: The sport was created as a challenge for Hawaiian warriors to demonstrate their loyalty to King Kahekili. Here Michal Navratil of the Czech Republic faces the clear water

Frightening: David Colturi of the USA dives from the 27-metre platform. There seem to be no qualms about the surrounding boats as the men tumble in nothing but Speedos

The season started in France's La Rochelle, followed by Copenhagen, and then Azores in Portugal.

From there they went on to Italy, Boston, Pembrokeshire, before reaching the southern coast of Thailand for the final.

Unfortunately, the penultimate stop scheduled for Brazil earlier this month had to be cancelled due to bad weather.

Russia's Artem Silchenko won the day's competition - but it wasn't enough to take the overall title from Britain's Gary Hunt, who has held the top spot since 2010.

Turn: Michal Navratil of the Czech Republic (left) and Steven LoBue of the USA (right) battle it out for the title with mind-blogging contortions

Worldwide: Before Thailand, the group competed in the beauty spots of France, Italy, Wales, Brazil, Copenhagen, Portugal, and Boston

Winning leap: Artem Silchenko of Russia prepares to launch an armstand dive from the 27-metre platform in the Andaman Sea during the last competition day of the eighth and final stop of the 2013 Red Bull Cliff Diving World Series

Third place overall: Orlando Duque of Colombia takes the plunge. The main rule that divers must adhere to is 'power and balance' as they fall towards the water below

Going into today's final, former Olympic hopeful Hunt, 29, who has won a number of medals at the Great Britain National Diving championships, was already the tournament leader.

Silchenko stood in second place and 10-time world champion Orlando Duque, from Colombia, was in third.

Mexico's Jonathan Paredes holds fifth, ahead of David Colturi, from the US.

The final moments: Silchenko's land. The land is the most crucial part of the fall - to maintain the style they have worked tirelessly to hone, and to ensure they don't injure themselves

Relax: Finally Artem Silchenko of Russia can celebrate after his final dive during the last competition day of this year's season. He could not take the top spot but won the day's contest

Champion: Silchenko stands on the podium as the other divers spray him with champagne and fans wave flags, lauding his success

Best seats: Crowds crammed onto boats to get the best view of divers - such as winner Silchenko (pictured centre) - performing their finale

Proud: Local media in Thailand described the event - the first one to be hosted by Krabi - as a very proud moment for the nation. Crowds gathered to hail Silchenko, the winner

Runners up: Steven LoBue (right) of the US took second place for the day and third place went to Orlando Duque (left) of Colombia

The sport started in the late 1700s as an initiation for Hawaiian warriors - as ordered by King Kahekili, who was obsessed by cliff diving.

He challenged his people to prove their loyalty by throwing themselves hundreds of feet into rocky water.

It is from that moment in time that the sport earned its mantra: 'mana and pona' - 'power and balance' in Hawaiian.

Now a global phenomenon, local Thai media has described the event - the first time it has been hosted by Krabi - as a very special moment for the nation.
