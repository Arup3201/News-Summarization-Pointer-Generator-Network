Too raunchy? J.D. Wintergreen made his campaign video a parody of an erectile dysfunction ad and played off John Boehner's last name

A Republican congressional candidate's innuendo-filled ad has gotten him fired from his job as an adjunct professor at a Christian college.

J.D. Winteregg is running to unseat House majority leader John Boehner in the upcoming midterm elections, and he made his minute-long ad a play on the Republican leader's name.

Styled as an ad for a prescription for 'electile dysfunction', the video features smiling couples doing inane activities together with a voiceover warning about possible side effects.

'If you have a Boehner lasting longer than 23 years, seek immediate medical attention,' the ad says.

'Other
 signs of electile dysfunction may include extreme skin discoloration, 
the inability to punch one's self out of a wet paper bag, or maintain a 
spine in the face of liberal opposition.'

By contrast, Mr Winteregg sells himself as a solution to the problems facing Boehner's constituents.

'Used on a daily basis, Winteregg in Congress will help you every time the moment is right,' the voiceover says.

'When
 using Winteregg, it's important to know the borders will be secure, 
second amendment rights protected, Obamacare and planned parenthood will
 be defunded, and common sense will be used in solving the nation's 
problems.'

Joke: The ad plays off the stereotypical ads which feature loving couples doing inane activities while a voiceover warns of the side effects of 'having a Boehner that lasts longer than 23 years'

While the video, titled 'When The Moment Is Right', has fans online- with more than 1,300 likes on YouTube- not all Ohioans have found it to be funny.

Mr Wintergg has worked as an adjunct French professor at Cedarville University for three years and his contract was not renewed as a result of the ad.

The university spokesman specifically told Fox News that the video ran in conflict to the Baptist school's values, but did not confirm why Mr Winteregg's contract was not renewed.

'(At Cedarville) we don't get into politics... We are all about Christ-centered education,' spokesman Mark Weinstein told Fox.

Mr Winteregg said that he knew some people would be offended by the ad but purposefully thought about whether deeply religious viewers would take issue with the more risquÃ© implications, deciding in the end that it was acceptable.

'We actually worked really hard to put something out that I could be comfortable with as a faithful person,' Mr Winteregg said to Fox.

'I knew it might upset some people, but we did the best we could to keep it as a parody.'
