Stephen Colbert married a couple on his show Thursday after the government shutdown threatened to destroy their plans to wed at the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C.

Colbert officiated the wedding between Mike Cassesso, 29, and MaiLien Le, 30, on 'The Colbert Show,' against the digital backdrop of the memorial where they had planned to wed Saturday.

The comedian - who is an ordained minister - said he came to the couple's rescue because he was moved by their story, noting, 'It caused a shutdown in here,' as he tapped his chest.

'Well, Nation,' Colbert said, 'I promised you on night one of the shutdown that as leader of the Colbert Nation and Earl Lord of the Afterscape, I would provide all canceled government services, and that includes weddings.'

Colbert first welcomes Cassesso and his two groomsmen to the stage. When he asks Cassesso how he's feeling, the groom responds: 'Wicked excited.

The group, including Colbert, then down a round of shots.

'Bachelor party!' Colbert shouts.

Colbert then welcomes the three bridesmaids and declares 'bachelorette party!' as they take a round of shots.

Next, the group waits on the bride, who doesn't arrive on time so Colbert seeks her out in the dressing room.

She tells Colbert she's nervous about getting married on T.V.

'Don't you ruin this for me!' Colbert tells her. 'This is my special day! I've been dieting for like 15 minutes!'

'Happy shutdown, everybody!' Colbert said at the end.

Cassesso and Le were notified Monday that their wedding could be canceled due to the shutdown.

As things stand, unless the government 
shutdown is resolved by 5.30pm on Saturday then Cassesso and Le plus 
their family and friends will be barred from stepping foot on the lawn 
which had until now held so many precious memories for them.

MaiLien Le, 30, and Mike Cassesso, 29, have had to quickly find an alternative venue for their wedding on Saturday as the west lawn of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial has been closed by the government shutdown

‘Shutdowns are one of those things 
that on an intellectual level you know are going to impact an average 
person, but you really don’t get it until it hits you in a way like 
this,’ Cassesso told the Washington Post. 

‘There
are plenty of people around the country who may not understand that 
this isn’t just going to hurt nameless government workers and that, in a
depressing way, it impacts your wedding plans with just a few days’ 
notice.’

The couple are so nostalgic about their first date by the Jefferson Memorial three years ago that, in the run-up to their wedding, they had a professional photographer take pictures of them paddleboating by the memorial again.

Washington couple Mike Cassesso and MaiLien Le have admitted they briefly contemplated crashing their own wedding site - the Thomas Jefferson Memorial which has been closed as part of the government shutdown

'This is a very meaningful site to me,' Cassesso.

A couple of weeks ago, when they began pondering how a shutdown might impact their nuptials, Cassesso and Le never thought that the wedding site would be off-limits.

‘We just thought there’d be leaves on the ground, that there’d be no maintenance, no rangers or Park Police,’ Cassesso said.

They couple even briefly contemplated crashing their own wedding site, but their thoughts quickly turned to finding an alternative venue.

Unless the government shutdown is resolved by 5.30pm on Saturday then Cassesso and Le will get married at the Sonoma Restaurant and Wine Bar on Capitol Hill, the venue for their reception

Unfortunately finding a venue for 130 
guests isn’t an easy task at short notice and the couple quickly 
determined that they had two options – to either marry at their 
reception venue, the Sonoma Restaurant and Wine Bar on Capitol Hill; or 
use the backyard of their apartment building.

Although Cassesso was keen to go with their backyard because they’d already spent $700 to rent chairs, his bride put her foot down because the yard is also home to a dumpster.

‘I don’t want there to be a dumpster. It’ll smell,’ said Le.

The couple are one of two dozen October weddings on the Mall endangered by the federal shutdown.

Nationwide more than 400 parks are impacted by the shutdown, but a spokeswoman for the National Park Service said it doesn’t have a tally for the number of weddings scheduled.
