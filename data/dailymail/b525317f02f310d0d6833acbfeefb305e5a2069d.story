A heroic off-duty firefighter who helped rescue a young boy after finding him in a pool of his own blood has revealed how he gave Martin Richard two breaths of CPR before covering the eight-year-old victim's lifeless body.

After Matt Patterson and brave stranger, Michael Chase, saved the life of the unidentified boy whose leg had been blown off by running him a block and a half to waiting ambulances, the 30-year-old sprinted back to the bomb site to help more victims.

There he came across little Martin, one of three people who were killed in the twin bombings at Monday's Boston Marathon.

'We just knew he was gone,' Patterson told MailOnline. 'He had very serious, serious injuries. We took a sheet and covered him.'

Patterson also helped a third victim, a 
man in his 30s, after it was confirmed the Dorchestor, Massachusetts, 
eight-year-old had succumbed to his horrific injuries.

Patterson said multiple people were trying to save Martin, but he believes he had already lost his battle when he arrived at his side.

'When I reached him there were just people helping as best they could,' he said. 'His clothes were torn and charred. I can't say if they were ripped from the blast or from people trying to save him.'

He said the boy was very pale and was laying on his back.

'There was nothing in his eyes,' Patterson said, clearly impacted by what he saw.

At that point, Patterson, who is a Lynn firefighter, rushed to help another victim - this time a man in his 30s whose left leg had been amputated.

He said by that stage Boston firefighters were on the scene and one member, whose name is unknown, helped him use a shoelace as a tourniquet to stop the bleeding.

'He had charring and burns on his clothes,' he told MailOnline. 'His clothes were still smoking when we cut them off. We carried him to an ambulance but it already had four people in the back of it so we had to find him another one. There were so many victims.'

The day began like any other Boston Marathon for the firefighter who was celebrating the sporting event with some drinks at a Boylston Street restaurant with his girlfriend and some friends.

But when he heard the first boom, he knew straight away that something wasn't right.

'It was very distinct to me,' Patterson said. 'I had an immediate recognition of that sound. It's just a feeling. My girlfriend looked at me and knew something was wrong. Then the second blast went off and I knew for a fact it wasn't a joke.'

He said he yelled at the people around him to get to the back of the restaurant, ensuring his girlfriend was among them, and then rushed out onto the street, which is when he noticed the first young victim.

Listen to Patterson's story from itemlive here:

Firefighter: Patterson, seen here fighting a fire, and speaking about his heroism Monday said has said he just wants to find out the boy he helped is doing. 'It'd make me feel better to know if we helped one person'

Brave: Michael Chase, left, and Dan Marshall, right, both sprung into action and rushed to the aid of wounded children following the explosions

'You get that initial shock and your eyes close,' he said of the immediate aftermath of the explosion. 'When I opened my eyes I saw chaos. There were people running and that's when I noticed the boy.

'He was far too small to be an adult so I immediately knew it was a child lying in the road, he was lying in a pool of blood. I ran over and noticed he had a clear amputation of his right leg.'

He said the boy, aged he thinks between seven and eight, was in severe shock.

'I was talking to him, asking his name,' Patterson told MailOnline. 'My best recognition is that it was Shane or Sean. He was so close to the blast, his hair was blown back like someone got a hairdryer and blew it back.

'He must have been thrown through the air. I was out of the restaurant so fast and he was already in the middle of the street.'

He said the boy had suffered a full amputation of his right leg.

'There was just soft tissue and muscle hanging,' he recalled. 'Ten seconds earlier he was having a great time in the street and the next second his whole life has changed.'

That's when the firefighter teamed up with heroic stranger Michael Chase.

Overwhelming: Michael Chase, posing for a picture with his family, said the boy they saved was 'a little peanut of a thing' like his young daughter

Fate: Patterson and Chase, pictured with wife Dena, were thrown together by fate and worked as a team to save the bleeding boy

'I identified myself as an off-duty 
firefighter. I asked him for his belt and we used it as a tourniquet to 
the boy's leg. We needed to get him help so we carried him a block and a
 half to the ambulance.'

He added, emotionally: 'We definitely saved that kid's life.'

Patterson said he's seen some pretty 
horrific things in his years as a firefighter, but Monday's shocking 
events probably come out on top.

'This would have to rank up there,' 
he told MailOnline. 'You never think you're going to have to treat a 
seven or eight-year-old child in the middle of Boylston Street at the Boston
 Marathon and then you turn around and see 40 more people who need help.

'It's not helplessness, but there's a
 feeling you can only do so much. I've had that feeling before of being 
helpless. It was an awful feeling. But I'm glad I did my (medics) 
training, and everything kicked in at the right time.'

Chase, who is trained as a police 
officer but doesn't work in the field because of a medical condition, 
agreed that the senseless events were overwhelming.

Describing the boy they helped
 as 'a little peanut of a thing,' Chase, 34, told the Boston Herald of 
the blasts' immediate aftermath: 'I have a 4-year-old daughter. It was all too much.'

Chase's friend, Dan Marshall, was among the people Patterson encountered who were trying to save Martin Richard.

'He was the first one I saw, and I sprung to him. I wish I could've helped more,' Marshall told The Salem News. 'It's extremely sad.'

Neither
 Patterson nor Chase, who stayed with the victim's shaken older brother 
until his father collected him, got the family's details in the chaos. 
Therefore, they have no way of knowing the injured boy's condition.

'I'd like to learn how he's doing. It'd make me feel better to know,' he said.

'It was the right place at the right time,' Chase told the Herald. 'I was glad I was able to help Matt. It was inspirational to work with someone like that.'

Boston Children's Hospital wouldn't give any details to MailOnline about whether one of the nine kids admitted to the hospital matched the description of the young victim.

As of Thursday, the hospital has two patients in critical condition and one who is out of ICU and in good condition. They would not give details of their ages.

Boston Medical Center has a five-year-old boy still in critical condition.
