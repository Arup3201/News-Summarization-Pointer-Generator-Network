Luis Suarez has expressed his delight after scoring his first goal for Barcelona.

The former Liverpool striker had to wait until his sixth game to score following his £75million summer move, and the Uruguayan was clearly relieved to have broken his duck.

He said: 'Obviously it's important for a striker to be scoring goals even though the priority is that you are playing well for the team. But it feels good to get off the mark.

'We knew they would play with ten men behind the ball because that is the way they played at the Camp Nou but we played well in the first half, we took our chances and could have maybe gone in with an even bigger lead. We also chased everything when we didn't have the ball which is also very important.'

Suarez opened the scoring in Barcelona's Champions League clash with APOEL Nicosia, while a Lionel Messi hat-trick ensured he became the highest scorer in European Cup history.

Barca now need to beat Paris Saint-Germain in their last game at home to win the group. 

Suarez said: 'We know how good they are but it depends on us doing the job at the Camp Nou.'
