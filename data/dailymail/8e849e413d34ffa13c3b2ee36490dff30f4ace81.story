In a bid to reach more customers, Microsoft has announced plans to open a retail store in the heart of Manhattan.

The software giant confirmed it will be taking over 677 Fifth Avenue - currently occupied by luxury fashion shop Fendi - as it continues to expand its retail presence.

According to the Washington-based firm, the store has been ‘five years in the making’ and it is expected to open next year.

Microsoft's Fifth Avenue store is expected to feature a range of Microsoft products, including Windows PCs, laptops, phones and tablets.

There will also be a gaming section, showcasing the firm’s Xbox One console, accessories and gaming titles. 

Microsoft’s shop will also feature trained technical support.

‘As our first flagship store, it will serve as the centerpiece of our Microsoft Stores experience,’ said David Porter, corporate vice president for Microsoft in a blog post. 

‘This is a goal we've had since day one - we were only waiting for the right location. And now we have it.’

It is expected to feature a range of Microsoft products, including Windows PCs, laptops, phones and tablets.

There will also be a gaming section, showcasing the firm’s Xbox One console, accessories and gaming titles, as well as customer support.

The retail spot is several blocks, or 90 addresses, from Apple’s large glass-fronted store, in a popular shopping location of the city.

This equates to 0.3 miles (482 metres) - or a five-minute walk. 

Apple's store has held a prominent place in the shopping district since 2006.

And, like the Apple store, Microsoft’s shop will feature trained technical support to help people with their devices. 

According to reports, average rents for shops on the avenue are $2,749 (£1,692) per square foot.

Since 2009, Microsoft has opened 104 stores in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico, in addition to Microsoft departments inside Best Buy stores across 600 locations.

The firm said it plans to open 10 more stores in the U.S and Canada before the end of the year, including Toronto, Tulsa, Bethesda, and Cerritos.

'Nearly five years after our first store in Scottsdale, Arizona opened, our footprint has reached a scale where 80 per cent of Americans are within 20 miles of a Microsoft Store,' continued Mr Porter. 

'[Plus] online stores in 189 countries and an expanding physical presence through our store-in-store locations in China.

'This is an important milestone for Microsoft overall, our stores team and millions of our current customers, as well as the millions to come. 

'We could not be more excited to join one of the most visited streets in America.'

Mr Porter did not expand on further plans to launch stores outside of the US.

Microsoft already has 104 stores, plus departments in more than 600 Best Buy locations in the US, Canada and Puerto Rico. It will open 10 more stores before the end of the year. The Boston store is pictured
