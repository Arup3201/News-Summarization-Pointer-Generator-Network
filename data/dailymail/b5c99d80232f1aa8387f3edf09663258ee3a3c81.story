‘The Celtic Warrior’ Steve Collins is to train London super middleweight Frank Buglioni after his split from Mark Tibbs.

Buglioni, nicknamed ‘The Wise Guy’, turned to Collins in the belief the Irish great can inspire him to a world title.

He will divide his time between working with Collins in both London, and Dublin’s Celtic Warriors gym, where Collins’ brother Paschal will also be involved.

‘When I met Frank I liked everything about him,’ Collins said.

‘He’s a hell of a fighter and has a great future. I believe he has the ability to go all the way and be a world champion.

‘He’s a very handsome young man who can fight. That’s a rare commodity. He’s got heart, a good chin and intelligence.

‘If you have all those three, you can build a champion.’

Collins, who travelled to the US to train alongside middleweight legend Marvin Hagler during his prime when he twice defeated both Chris Eubank and Nigel Benn, added Buglioni considered a similar move.

‘I think Frank wanted a change of scenery. I think he wanted to change from a British style and was looking to go for the American scene.

‘So I said to him: “America’s a long way. Why don’t you go to Dublin and check out The Celtic Warriors camp, because Paschal is the main man over there. And he’s come through the [American] system, spent five or six years with the Petronellis [brothers Goody and Pat], finished with Freddie Roach, so you might not need to go to America.”

‘So he went to Dublin and absolutely fell head over heels. Loved the set up over there. Loved the coach, loved the sparring, and knew straight away that was for him.

‘Myself, and my brother Paschal are two heads working together. This will bring more attention to the Celtic Warrior camp in Dublin.’

Buglioni, 25, explained: ‘There are similarities between me and Steve as fighters.

‘Steve’s a giant of the sport and I feel he’s got the experience and knowledge to help me fulfil my goals.’

Tibbs added: ‘I wish Frank all the best. He deserves everything he gets out of the game.’
