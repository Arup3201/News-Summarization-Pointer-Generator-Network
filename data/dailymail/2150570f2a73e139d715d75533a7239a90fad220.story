A German poker professional who was thinking of quitting the game to return to college has won an incredible $8.72 million in the World Series final.

Pius Heinz, 22, beat Martin Staszko of the Czech Republic to take victory in the World Series of Poker.

It is believed that Heinz, who had a rough six-month run in poker before the series, was thinking about quitting the professional circuit.

Celebrations begin: Pius Heinz is mobbed by his delighted supporters following his tense victory

But thankfully for him he decided against such a move and won the game's biggest tournament - along with the huge amount of money.

The tournament used the Texas hold 'em format in which all players 'share' five 'community' cards and two cards of their own. Heinz held an ace and a king, while his opponent held a seven and a ten, with the community cards helping neither player.

According to The Washington Post, Heinz said after his victory: 'Honestly I’m not sure what I’m going to do with the money.

'Probably my family is going to get a couple of gifts.'

He added: 'It’s got to be the happiest day of my life. I can’t believe what happened - it’s unreal.'

For the first time ever the final was 
aired almost live on TV with just a 15-minute delay to ensure that 
players couldn't cheat.

And viewers were treated to a tense game which resulted in a number of changes in the lead.

Heinz, from Cologne, Germany, and 
Staszko, 35, of Trinec, were each guaranteed a payday of at least $5.43 
million for finishing second.

Heinz
led at the start with just over half the chips in play, but Staszko 
quickly took that lead away as the players began trading chips.

Texas Hold 'em is a variation of the standard card game of poker.

The game consists of two cards being dealt face down to each player and then five community cards being placed face-up by the dealer - the first three are dealt then two additional single cards.

Bets can be placed before any of the community cards are dealt, after the first three, and then after each of the other two.

Players have the option to check, bet, raise or fold after each deal.

The no-limit betting structure allows each player to raise the bet by any amount up to and including his entire remaining stake at any time.

Each player must lose all his chips to be eliminated from the no-limit Texas Hold `em tournament, and win all the chips in play to take the crown.

Pius Heinz wagered the last of his chips against Martin Staszko with his two cardas being an ace and a king.

This was a brave move as it is one of the trickiest hands to play in tournaments.

Staszko held a seven and ten of clubs.The board was a five of clubs, deuce of diamonds, nine of spades, jack of hearts and four of diamonds, helping neither player.

There were eight lead changes over 
the first three hours of play, the eighth coming just after a break when
Staszko responded to a 20 million chip bet from Heinz by announcing a 
re-raise.

Heinz immediately folded.

Staszko at one point had a 2-1 chip advantage, but that was gone within minutes.

Staszko regained the lead before a break in play, and had about 60 per cent of all the chips in play after five hours, excluding breaks.

Each player must lose all his chips to be eliminated from the no-limit Texas Hold `em tournament, and win all the chips in play to take the crown.

Heinz aggressively stormed from seventh in chips to first at the nine-hand final table on Sunday.

He went from 16.4 million in chips to 107.8 million in just more than 7 1/2 hours of play, propelling him to a higher finish than at least six of his competitors.

Las Vegas poker professional Ben Lamb collected a cool $4 million for finishing in third place.

The 26-year-old was defeated by Staszko on Tuesday night.

'I got the sense he wasn't like super strong, but he actually was stronger than I thought he was,' Lamb said.

'Every poker player dreams of having the year I had, so I don't want to sit here and have people like cry for me," he said. "I'll be OK."
