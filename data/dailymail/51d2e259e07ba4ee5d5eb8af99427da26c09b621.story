It was a memorable night for Interstellar and Kingsman: The Secret Service as the 20th Jameson Empire Awards celebrated another 12 months of cinema in London on Sunday evening.

Helmed by British director Christopher Nolan and starring Jessica Chastain, Interstellar walked away with two of the night’s biggest prizes – Best Film and Best Director for Nolan.

Both were in attendance at Park Lane’s Grosvenor House, but their overwhelming success on the night was matched by that of the British spy-caper.

Out of this world: It was a clean sweep for Interstellar at the 20th Jameson Empire Awards on Sunday evening; the movie Best Film and Best Director for Nolan, who was joined on the night by glamorous leading lady Jessica Chastain 

Despite the absence of principal cast-members Taron Egerton and Colin Firth, the Matthew Vaughn directed spoof – nominated in four categories – claimed awards for Best British Film and Best Newcomer. 

The latter went to rising star Egerton, whose filming commitments as Eddie ‘The Eagle’ Edwards in a biopic about the former skier saw him miss the event.

But while the actor was unable to collect his award in person, co-star Mark Strong was on hand to bestow the Best Thriller award – won by The Imitation Game – to Alex Lawther.

Success: The Empire Awards credited Nolan with Best Director for the science fiction epic, which is set on a planet Earth blighted by crop shortages

Absent: Principal cast-members Colin Firth and Taron Egerton were missing on a special night for the spy-spoof 

In the absence of leading stars Benedict Cumberbatch and Kiera Knightley, the young actor gratefully accepted the accolade on behalf of the Oscar-nominated film.

Elsewhere Knightley – currently expecting her first child with husband James Righton – lost out in the Best Actress category.

Somewhat inevitably it was Rosamund Pike who triumphed for her stirring performance alongside Ben Affleck in Gone Girl – a role that previously won her deserved nominations at the Golden Globes and 87th annual Academy Awards.

Special honour: Mark Strong was also on hand to present the award for Best Thriller to The Imitation Game star Alex Lawther 

Recognition: Andy Sekis won the award for Best Actor following his portrayal of Caesar in Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes, whille Karen Gillan won the award for Best Female Newcomer courtesy of her post Doctor Who role in Marvel adventure Guardians Of The Galaxy

In attendance: Nolan and Chastain toast the success of Interstellar after taking the stage at London's Grosvenor House hotel 

Accepting her award via video link on Sunday evening she told the audience: ‘I cannot believe that the one time I can’t attend an award ceremony is the one time I win.

‘I’ve become so accomplished at losing I have no idea what to say now I’ve won.’

Karen Gillan was another winner on the night; the Scottish star, who looked stunning in a sleeveless shirt dress, claimed the award for Best Female Newcomer courtesy of her post Doctor Who role in Marvel adventure Guardians Of The Galaxy.

The delighted star later tweeted a picture of herself with the award on Twitter, captioning the shot: ‘Look at what you did! To all who voted; THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU!!!!!!’
