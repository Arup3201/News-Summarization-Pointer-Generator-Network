The youngest sister of Nicole Brown Simpson has opened up about her sister's brutal murder after 20 years and revealed the moment she knew that the man she called 'Uncle OJ' was responsible for her death.

Tanya Brown, now 44, described how her family's lives were forever shattered on the morning of June 13, 1994, when they found out that Nicole, recently divorced from OJ Simpson, had been stabbed to death outside her Los Angeles home along with her friend Ronald Goldman.

She said the grief-stricken family watched on TV as her sister's bloodied corpse was loaded into a van to be taken to the morgue. Ms Brown said she held her mother's shaking hands as she wept: 'That's my kid.'

Tanya Brown, the sister of Nicole Brown Simpson, said her family's lives were turned upside down following her siblings murder 20 years ago and the subsequent trial of Nicole's ex-husband OJ Simpson

Ms
 Brown said that at first she did not suspect Simpson, the former 
football player turned actor, whom she knew as a beloved brother-in-law.

Simpson and Ms Brown married in 1985 and had two children Sydney and Justin. In 1989, the former football player pleaded no contest to a domestic violence charge against Simpson. They divorced in 1992.

After her sister's death, Ms Brown said she was exposed to the 
harrowing truth - that Simpson was a violent man who had mentally and physically abused her sister 
for years.

In the days following the murders, the net began to close on Simpson, now considered the prime suspect.

On June 17, the day that Simpson was supposed to turn himself over to police on murder charges, the
 former football player led officers on an infamous low-speed pursuit 
in a white Ford Bronco SUV in California.

Tanya Brown revealed to People
 that during this bizarre car chase, which was broadcast to millions on live TV across the major networks, her
 father and elder sister Denise were on the phone trying to talk Simpson
 out of killing himself as he rode along with a gun to his head. 

Ms
 Brown told the magazine: 'What many people don't know is that he called
 us during the chase and Denise and my dad tried to talk him down.

'''Don't
 do it, Juice!'' Daddy urged him, trying to get him to put the gun down 
and pull over. ''Think of your two kids, Juice! Don't do it!'''

Simpson finally surrendered to police and was jailed awaiting trial.

Ms Brown also revealed that a few days after he was put behind bars, Simpson called to speak to her. Simpson asked Tanya if she knew that he loved her sister and 'would have taken a bullet for her'.

Conflicted about Simpson's role in her sister's brutal death, Tanya 
tried to change the subject and told her former brother-in-law about her
 friend's father who was dying of a brain aneurysm.

She said that Simpson responded by ranting about being stuck in a tiny cell and complained that no one was worried about him.

Ms Brown told People: 'He continued to babble about his woes and actually tried to put the entire blame on Nicole for their marriage falling apart.'

When
 the grieving 24-year-old fired back at Simpson that her sister had 
dedicated her life to him - the accused murderer hung up.

Ms Brown added: 'I slammed the phone down and I cried. It was at that moment that I could no longer deny the suspicions that so many others had.

'At that moment, I knew what he had done to my sister.'

The internationally publicized trial of O.J. Simpson lasted one year and was dubbed the 'trial of the century'. In 1995, Simpson was acquitted of the 1994 murders of his ex-wife and Mr Goldman.

The anguish for the victims' families did not end there. For Tanya Brown, her sister's brutal death unleashed years of depression and drug and alcohol abuse that culminated in her almost taking her own life in 2004.

Following psychiatric treatment and therapy, Ms Brown now says she has turned 'this ugly thing into something good'.

Now a life coach and mental-health advocate, she has recently written a memoir about the loss of her sister, entitled Finding Peace Amid The Chaos.

Ms Brown says that she still talks to her late sister's children Justin. 25, and Sydney, 28, who are both in the restaurant business in the Southeast. She said that they never talk about their father.

In 2008, Simpson was found guilty of kidnapping, armed robbery and other charges in what he said was an attempt to retrieve memorabilia and personal items from two sports collectibles dealers in a casino hotel room.

Simpson was sentenced to between nine to 33 years in Nevada state prison but was granted parole on some convictions last July. However he must serve at least four more years.

Simpson's conviction came 13 years to the day after he was acquitted of his ex-wife and Mr Goldman's murders. .

O.J. Simpson and his defense attorneys listen during a hearing in Clark County District Court in May 2013 in Las Vegas. Simpson is currently serving up to 33-years in state prison as a result of his October 2008 conviction for armed robbery and kidnapping charges
