Jose Manuel Barroso walks away from his role as President of the European Commission with a pension worth more than £100,000-a-year, it emerged today.

The Brussels chief, who has opposed demands from Britain for radical reform of EU migration, will enjoy the annual pay check provided he remains 'loyal' to the European project.

Tory MPs condemned the 'greed and arrogance' of EU fat cats, and urged David Cameron to 'put them in their place'.

Jose Manuel Barroso retires as European Commission President with a pension worth more than £100,000-a-year

After demanding Britain pay an extra £1.7billion to EU coffers, Mr Barroso is also in line for a generous 'transitional allowance', travel and moving costs and a month's salary to help him adjust to life outside Brussels.

Mr Barroso has repeatedly clashed with Mr Cameron, frustrating his attempts at EU reform.

In a farewell speech in London last week, Mr Barroso warned Britain's hopes of restricting migrant numbers would 'not be in conformity with European laws'.

And on Thursday it emerged that deays before he stands down, the Commission had ordered the UK to pay an extra £1.7billion for its EU membership.

The Commission issued the demand after using rules dating back to 1995 and finding Britain's economy has grown faster than expected, so must pay a greater share to Brussels. To add insult to injury, France will receive a £790million rebate because its economy is struggling.

Furious Mr Cameron hit back insisting it was an 'appaling' way to behave, and warned the move made it harder to justify Britain's membership of the EU.

But Mr Barroso brushed aside the 'concerns in London' and insisted 'sometimes these decisions do happen'

Details of the remuneration of outgoing commissioners show the generous payments Mr Barroso can look forward to.

He is entitled to an annual pension worth 4.275 per cent of the basic salary for every full year in office.

His monthly salary of €25,554.58 ( or £20,188.12) means his annual pension pot after 10 years in office will be £103,562.

Pension experts said someone paying into a normal pension would have to build up a pension fund worth £3.6million to secure such generous annual payouts.

Tory MP Stewart Jackson told MailOnline: 'This doesn't surprise me. The British people are fed up with the greed and arrogance of unelected EU fat cats like Barroso. 

'It's time the UK flexed it's muscles and David Cameron took a lead in putting them in their place.' 

Conservative Peter Bone said: 'It's a joke isn't it. All this does is add to the growing numbers of people who want to take us out of the EU.

'What it looks like, and what it is, is an elite who pay themselves what they like, don't listen to the British people and don;t take decisions in the national interest.'

Mr Barroso will also get a 'resettlement allowance' of one month's basic salary and 'travel expenses and moving costs are reimbursed', according to the European Commission website.

David Cameron has clashed with Mr Barroso over immigration and a demand for Britain to pay an extra £1.7billion

A transitional allowance is also paid for three years, beginning on the day after leaving office.

This allowance is between 40 and 65 per cent of his £242,000 annual basic salary, and is subject to European Union tax.

The transitional allowance can be capped but only if he takes up a new job, and his new salary plus his allowance means he is earning more than a member of the Commission.

Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Business for Britain, told the Sunday Times: 'It's ridiculous that the European Union hands out lavish perks for ex-officials one day and then demands more money from Britain the next.

'Both voters and the business leaders who create jobs in the UK will find President Barroso's lecturing particularly grating, given that we're paying him to promote the EU for the rest of his life.'

A spokesman for Mr Barroso said: 'All information on commissioners' salaries and entitlements, including pensions, is public. We never do bespoke calculations, or check figures prepared by others when it comes to the precise remuneration or pension of named individuals.

'The commission does not set the terms of commissioners' salaries and entitlements; the member states do.'
