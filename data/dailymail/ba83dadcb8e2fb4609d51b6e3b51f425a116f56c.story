Jesean Morris, 20, was wanted for violating his parole in Omaha, Nebraska

A young man trying to give back by taking part in the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge last week ended up getting hosed when authorities recognized him as a fugitive wanted for violating his parole.

Jesean Morris, 20, found himself heading back to prison  when police were tipped of about the video posted on his Facebook page.

Someone who knew Morris alerted authorities in Omaha, Nebraska, after watching the video and recognizing Morris, and also identified the house where it was shot.

'They were given a specific house' by one tipster, Officer Kevin Wiese, a police spokesman told Omaha.com. 

On Friday afternoon, officers Nick Sidzyik and Dan Martin set out to the house to see if they could possibly find and capture the foolish fugitive.

Their hard work paid off when they saw him getting in the backseat of a friend's car that afternoon.

The officers then followed Morris, and, once they stopped the vehicle, the wanted man was anything but charitable, giving the men a false name and birth date and spitting in the face of Martin, this after kicking out a safety partition in the cruiser.

He was booked later that day on the outstanding warrant and on suspicion of criminal impersonation, resisting arrest and assaulting an officer. A judge set Morris' bail at $40,000.

Morris was on parole following his release from the Omaha Correctional Center, where he served a sentence as the result of a 2010 conviction for assault and use of a firearm during a crime. 

He was 16 at the time, but charged as an adult, as the shootout he was involved in left two men wounded.

Even worse, Morris' Ice Bucket Challenge seems to have been removed from his Facebook page. 

The ALS Association has raised $79.7 million to combat Lou Gehrig's Disease since July 29, almost entirely as a result of the Challenge.

The ALS Association's is dedicated to bringing national  attention to ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease
