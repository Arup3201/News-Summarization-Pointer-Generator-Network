Dave McLuckie, the former chairman of Cleveland Policy Authority, has been jailed for eight months for getting a friend to take speeding points for him

A former police chief who persuaded a friend to take speeding points for him so he wouldn't miss out on the top job has been jailed for eight months.

Dave McLuckie, 52, was on the brink of becoming the chairman of Cleveland Police Authority when asked his friend Maurice Ward for a 'big favour' to help him avoid a driving ban in 2005.

He had been caught by a speed camera doing 36mph in a 30mph zone in his black Peugeot and already had nine points on his licence.

McLuckie's crime only came to light following a fall-out with Mr Ward, who became ill with cancer two years later and felt his friend had not visited him enough.

Mr Ward, who died in January last year, wrote a note stating that he had taken the points for McLuckie, which was discovered by his widow after his death.

Mr Ward's daughter Donna told a local councillor about her discovery and the police were informed.

McLuckie, from Great Ayton, North Yorkshire, denied perverting the course of justice but was convicted at Newcastle Crown Court last month.

He told the court that the Ward family was driven by malice but did not specifically deny being the driver.

The disgraced police chief claimed he had 
spoken to Mr Ward who agreed he had probably been driving the car 
on that occasion.

Passing sentence, Judge David Wood told McLuckie: 'This offence does really strike at the heart of the legal system.'

He said he had to give McLuckie a prison term despite the excellent 
references McLuckie had put forward, and being a man of 'exemplary 
character'.

'This case is not really about penalty 
points, it’s about justice and equality before the law. You are not 
entitled to avoid the law or interfere with the course of justice.'

The judge did not impose a driving ban and said Mr Ward would have received the same prison sentence if he were still alive.

Julian Smith, defending, said McLuckie
had stepped down as a councillor at Redcar and Cleveland Council and 
from voluntary organisations he represented.

He has been suspended from his managerial role at a potash mine, and was on gardening leave.

McLuckie realised he might not have a future with the company where he has worked for 31 years, he said.

Mr Smith said McLuckie’s own 'poignant' assessment of the case was that 'it has destroyed everything I have ever been'.

Mr Ward’s handwritten note said: 
'DM caught speeding Carlin How 15-4-2005. 3 points penalty. 12.16pm 
36mph. Took my licence in himself to pay.

'He had called at my house on 
28-4-2005 at 8.50. He had a coffee and asked me if I would lend him my 
licence to get 3 points deducted to help him get the post of Chairman of
Cleveland Police which I did.'

McLuckie was still under investigation by Operation Sacristy - an inquiry into alleged corruption within Cleveland Police - which has caused him regional notoriety, and will make his time in prison difficult, his barrister said.

'That is likely to attract the wrong kind of attention, that is a matter about which he is understandably concerned,' Mr Smith said.

As he was led from court, McLuckie blew a kiss and said 'Love you' to his partner in the public gallery.

Today, the Crown Prosecution Service said that Mr Ward's guilty conscience made him write the note.

Gerry Sydenham, head of the Crown Court Unit at CPS North East, said: 'Mr Ward became increasingly troubled by his part in this and, while suffering from a fatal illness, he wrote a note to his family to clear his conscience.

'That short note prompted the criminal prosecution that led to McLuckie’s sentence today and I would hope that today’s result gives some measure of closure to Mr Ward’s family.'
