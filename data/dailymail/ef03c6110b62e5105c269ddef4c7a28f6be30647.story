A Brazilian nurse who was caught on camera repeatedly attacking a dog, which later died of its injuries, has gone into hiding after the video was published on YouTube.

The disturbing video of Camila de Moura abusing the Yorkshire Terrier in front of her 18-month-old daughter was taken by a neighbour living in the same apartment block in Formosa, Brazil.

She originally handed it over to the local police, but posted it online after becoming frustrated that the authorities had not arrested de Moura and were not going to pursue the case.

Terror: By the end of the attack, the dog was cowering in the corner behind its basket, shaking and looking like it had been covered in liquid

After a national outcry, an investigation was quickly launched, and hundreds of thousands have joined Facebook groups or signed an online petition demanding that the 22-year-old be brought to justice.

When officers arrived at de Moura's home she reportedly tried to explain her actions by saying she was ‘having a bad day, going through some family problems and an attack of nerves.’

Irresponsible: She repeatedly hit the dog on the head in front of her 18-month-old daughter who stood watching the abuse

The dog was found in a poor state and died of its injuries two days later.

De
Moura, who is married to a doctor, has gone into hiding after receiving
more than 40,000 death threats, according to her lawyer Gilson Afonso 
Saad.

He told Brazil's 
Correio Braziliense newspaper: 'It's humanly impossible for her to 
remain in her home. Her apartment block was surrounded by a mob throwing
stones. There have even been people offering money for someone to kill 
her.

Hidden: A bucket was placed over the dog several times during the video

'The situation has got out of control. The threats aren't restricted to her, but also affect her husband and daughter.'

A
police spokesman said the investigation is expected to conclude on 
Wednesday and could result in de Moura being sentenced to up to a year 
in prison for animal cruelty.

The brutal attack was witnessed by a child, so she could also be charged 
under the Children's Act for 'exposing a child to shame or 
embarrassment, the maximum penalty for which is three years behind 
bars,' he added.

The case is the latest in a number of incidents of animal cruelty in Brazil which have shocked the country in recent weeks.

Earlier this month a three-month-old puppy was buried alive for more than 12 hours in Novo Horizonte, Sao Paulo state. The animal was rescued and is slowly recovering from its ordeal.

And last week a dog was tied to a car by its neck and dragged through the streets of Cidade Soberana, in Guaralhos, Sao Paulo, after a neighbour became irritated by its constant barking.
