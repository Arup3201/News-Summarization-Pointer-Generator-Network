The child is allegedly the victim of a murder-suicide attempt. American Fork police Sgt. Gregg Ludlow told KSL.com that Petersen had laid Ryker on a couch, moved to a different room and loaded a rifle with a single .22 round.

Petersen returned to shoot the baby in the head. Ludlow confirmed that he was preparing to turn the rifle on himself when he was stopped by another family member in the house.

Petersen told authorities he had been planning to kill his son and then himself for the past month, as reported by KSL.com.

Police said the motive for the killing was still under investigation but added that the case is being treated as murder.

'It's very early on in the 
investigation. We're pursuing a lot of different leads,' Ludlow said. 
'At this point, we are investigating this as a homicide.' Petersen has no prior criminal history.

Authorities confirmed that Petersen and the baby lived at the 600 N. 500 East address in American Fork but wouldn't provide other details about other occupants of the home

Family members gathered at the house on Friday afternoon.

Petersen's Facebook page is full of pictures of his son. The father's recent updates appear to show that his mood was down when he wasn't with Ryker.

American Fork police Sgt. Gregg Ludlow had a short press conference where he said: 'It's very early on in the investigation. We're pursuing a lot of different leads. At this point, we are investigating this as a homicide.'

His most recent post on March 27 was: 'its a sad day but not when i have my son he makes me happy.' A day earlier Petersen wrote 'im haveing (sic) a bad day besides when i had my son.' Other updates refer to 'happy times' with his son.

Petersen's neighbor Fran Keller told The Salt Lake Tribune that the residents of the house were an elderly couple with grandchildren.

Keller reacted to the news of the shooting with sadness. 'I’m pretty upset,' she said to the Tribune. 'How do you go on and even live after this?'
