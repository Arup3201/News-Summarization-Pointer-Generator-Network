Donald Sterling’s affair with the model 'girlfriend' who exposed him as a racist wasn’t ‘his first rodeo’ and the LA Clippers owner’s wife is the person ‘least fooled and least affected by his ‘grotesque lifestyle’, explosive court papers reveal.

Vanessa Stiviano’s lawyer set out a strident defense of the 31-year-old after Rochelle Sterling sued her for embezzling $1.8m – the total gifts and cash Sterling, 80, is said to have given his 31-year-old lover – including a condo, a Ferrari, two Bentleys and a Range Rover.

Mac E Nehoray wrote in response to the 
suit: ‘This is an action brought by a very angry wife whose husband is a
 highly public figure and who is well known to the “keeping women” other
 than his wife and who has done so for very many years with a big toothy
 grin brandishing his sexual prowess in the faces of the Paparazzi and 
caring less what anyone else thought, the least of which, his own wife’.

'Grotesque': Donald Sterling and his wife, Rochelle, leave after having dinner together on Sunday night. Court papers allege she knew of his 'grotesque' lifestyle of bedding other women

The lawsuit is believed to be what is behind the leaking of a tape which sparked a firestorm on 
Saturday. On it, the Clippers owner appears to go off on a racist rant in which he berated Stiviano for being
 seen in public with black friends, including Magic Johnson.

The
 shocking clip set off a massive scandal, with current and former NBA 
players like LeBron James and Charles Barkley calling on the league to 
take immediate action against Sterling.

The NBA is investigating the claims and is set to make a decision within days and sponsors are starting to drop the team.

The papers, in which Rochelle claims Stiviano has been having sex with Sterling since 2010 after they met at the Super Bowl, went on: ‘Donald Sterling has flaunted that grotesque lifestyle in front of and in his wife’s face for nearly their entire marriage of 50 years. The person least fooled and least affected and least “robbed of her due” is Rochelle Sterling.

‘At minimum, she has been complicit for over 50 years and, here, particularly, has “looked the other way” if not put hands over her mouth, covered her eyes and attempted to cover her ears. Further, this is not the “first rodeo” as the expression goes.’

Nehoray continued: ‘It is clear from past conduct, that Mrs Sterling has at a minimum, either “enabled” Donald Sterling to do, over and over again what he does, or that she approved of the varied and many gifts as described in the complaint.

‘The “relationship” (whatever it may have been or not been) between Donald Sterling and V Stiviano was open, notorious, obvious and long standing.’

Elsewhere in the papers, he said: ‘Instead of chastising her philandering husband, let alone curtailing his carousing, Mrs Sterling seeks to punish (Stiviano) who has done nothing wrong.'

Despite appearing at the game on Sunday night dressed all in black in an apparent show of solidarity with the LA Clippers players, Rochelle went to eat at Flemings Steak House in El Segundo afterwards with her husband of 57 years.

Pictured for the first time since hate-filled comments he allegedly made about African Americans emerged on Friday night, Sterling, who did not attend last nights game, appeared relaxed as he was photographed, while his wife attempted to shield her face with her handbag.

According to the New York Post, when a paparazzo asked 'Are you a racist, Mr. Sterling?' Shelly screamed that it was all lies.

'No, of course not!' she yelled.

'Forget it. It's not true.'

Just hours earlier however, she released a statement saying: 'Our family is devastated by the racist comments made by my estranged husband.

'My children and I do not share these despicable views or prejudice. We will not let one man’s small mindedness poison the spirit of the fans and accomplishments of the team in the city we love.'

Meanwhile, Stiviano has gone to deny she is his girlfriend - which is bizarre in light of what her lawyer said.

Sources close to Stiviano claimed she works in a purely professional capacity for Sterling as his 'archivist' and spilts her time between the Clippers and the teams official charity.

Bizarre: Despite Stiviano's lawyer stating that the model wasn't Sterling's 'first rodeo', she is now claiming she isn't his girlfriend

It has now been claimed that 
Sterling contacted Stiviano to ask, 'How can we make this go away?' amid
 claims she has more than 100 hours of recordings, it has been reported.

Sterling contacted Stiviano on Sunday and was told to contact her lawyer, TMZ Sports has now reported.

Nehoray said Sunday that the male voice heard on the 15-minute recording making incredibly offensive remarks to his client about African Americans is definitely Sterling's.

But the NBA boss claimed Stiviano released it in a bid to 'get even' with his wife because of the bitter lawsuit.

'Due to the present litigation and its absurd allegations, which Ms. Stiviano vehemently denies, Ms. Stiviano and this office have no comments at this time,' Nehoray said in a statement to the newspaper.

In court documents filed March 7 by Sterling's spouse of 50 years and the mother of his three children, Rochelle Sterling writes that her husband and Stiviano - who also goes by the aliases Vanessa Maria Perez, Monica Gallegos, Maria Monica Perez Gallegos and Maria Valdez – first met in 2010 at the Super Bowl.

According to Mrs Sterling's lawsuit over the past four years, her husband used their commonly owned resources to buy his girlfriend a 2012 Ferrari, a pair of Bentleys and a 2013 Range Rover worth a total of more than $500,000.

In additional to the high-end vehicles, some of which are prominently featured on Stiviano's instagram account documenting her high-flying lifestyle, Mr Sterling also gifted her $1.4million to buy a duplex on West 4th Street in Los Angeles and $240,000 for living expenses.

Mrs Sterling's lawsuit, which claims that her husband gave Stiviano money and presents without her consent, seeks full restitution along with unspecified compensatory damages.

According to Rochelle Sterling, before she filed her complaint in court, Donald Sterling himself had asked Stiviano to return the money and property, but the woman allegedly refused.

Nehoray, presented a counter-argument, claiming that a gift cannot be revoked by the giver – legalese for ‘no taksies backsies.’

In a court filing, the lawyer also insisted that there is not ‘a peppercorn of a fact’ that his client committed any fraud or exercised undue influence.

Nehoray added that nowhere in Mrs Sterling’s lawsuit does it say that ‘the feminine wiles of Ms. Stiviano overpowered the iron will of’ Donald Sterling, ‘who is well known as one of the most shrewd businessmen in the world.’
