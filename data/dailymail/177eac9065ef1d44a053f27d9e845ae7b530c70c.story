A prison inmate who was once friends with accused Utah wife killer Dr. Martin MacNeill testified Wednesday that the former Mormon leader admitted while they were serving together at Texarkana Federal Prison that he drowned his wife.

Inmate No. 1, as he was known to the court, told the jury that MacNeill 'said he had to help her out and said he held her head under the water for a while.'

The damning revelation came just after another jailmate, Jason Poirier, told the court that MacNeill bragged that he 'can get away with a lot of things,' including murdering his wife.

Speaking out: Attorney Randy Spencer, right, questions Jason Poirier, a former inmate who served time with Martin MacNeill, a doctor accused of killing his wife. Poirier said MacNeill acknowledged the murder

'He said he gave her some oxy and some sleeping pills, then got her to get in the bath tub,' Inmate No. 1 elaborated.

McNeill was in jail at the time for identity fraud. He was released in July 2012.

The two became friends while taking a prison computer class together, ABC News reports. And Inmate No. 1 made remarks about his wife's death on several occasions.

'He said she was in the way. She wanted the house and the kids,' said Inmate No. 1, who remains behind bars on drug and firearm convictions.

Poirier testified that MacNeill told him: 'I'm 
getting away with the murder of my wife.'

The
testimony came as the trial in Provo, Utah resumed on Wednesday. MacNeill is accused of killing his wife Michele
in April 2007 so that he could be with his mistress.

Poirier recounted his conversation with MacNeill in December 2012
at Utah County jail, a few months after MacNeill's arrest in the death.

Poirier, who was being held on suspicion of shoplifting at the time, told the court that the conversation started when he asked MacNeill how he was able to get away with wearing custom-made shoes in jail.

He said MacNeill replied: 'I can get away with a lot of things. I'm getting away with the murder of my wife.'

A few days later, Poirier said, he asked MacNeill if the remark had been serious.

The doctor replied he was serious, threw up his arms and said, 'Look where I'm at,' Poirier claimed.

Poirier took the stand under a limited
grant of immunity. Defense lawyers attacked Poirier's credibility by 
getting him to acknowledge he thought he would avoid charges by 
informing on MacNeill.

Three other prison inmates testified on Tuesday that MacNeill regularly cursed his wife and bragged that investigators couldn't prove he killed her.

One inmate said MacNeill referred to his wife as a 'b****' and that he said: 'If I did [kill her] they don't have any evidence.'

Those inmates were from a federal prison in Texas where MacNeill was held on fraud charges.

Prosecutors are now nearing the end of 
their mostly circumstantial case against MacNeill and are expected to 
wrap up their evidence on Wednesday.

Prosecutors say MacNeill, 57, hounded 
his wife to get cosmetic surgery then knocked her out with painkillers, 
Valium and sleeping pills before leaving her to die in the tub.

Loss: MacNeill, a former Sunday school teacher, and his wife Michele had eight children together

Defense lawyers have argued that MacNeill had a heart attack and died after falling into a bathtub in 2007. But a cardiologist testified last Friday that Mrs MacNeill wasn't at risk of a heart attack.

Utah cardiologist David Cragun told a court that the 50-year-old had a mild form of heart disease that wouldn't have killed her.

Prosecutors called Cragun and another expert to suggest Michele MacNeill's death must have involved foul play.

'My opinion is that Michele died as a result of drowning,' testified Joshua Perper, a forensic pathologist from Florida.

Anna Walthall, a mistress of Martin MacNeill, previously testified that he once described over 'pillow talk' how he could induce a heart attack in someone that would appear natural.
