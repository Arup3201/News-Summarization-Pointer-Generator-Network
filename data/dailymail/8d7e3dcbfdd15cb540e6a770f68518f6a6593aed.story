Millionaire Hekmat Kaveh, 55, who runs £20,000-a-year The Abbey College in Malvern, Worcestershire, admitted 15 breaches of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005

The owner of one of Britain's top independent schools has been ordered to pay nearly £50,000 for risking pupils' lives by having 'woefully inadequate' fire safety measures.

Millionaire Hekmat Kaveh, 55, who runs £20,000-a-year The Abbey College in Malvern, Worcestershire, admitted 15 fire safety breaches when he appeared in court on Wednesday.

The Iranian-born property developer, who lives in a £1.4million Georgian mansion in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was fined £24,000 for the offences and ordered to pay £25,000 court costs.

Worcester Crown Court heard the school, which has around 200 pupils 
aged 14-20, had 'defective smoke alarms and non-functional fire doors in
 student sleeping areas'.

Judge Michael Cullum told Kaveh his fire risk assessment was 'woefully 
inadequate' and said the wealthy businessman had 'both a moral and legal
 responsibility' for the staff and children.

'The consequences of a fire would have been disastrous,' he added.

Hereford and Worcester Fire and Rescue Service brought the prosecution 
against Kaveh after inspectors visited the school in 2011.

Kaveh told
 the court: 'Clearly, I was let down by those people employed and 
instructed to review the fire assessment at the start of the year, but 
the law is clear in that the employer is the responsible person and for 
that reason I had no option but to plead guilty.

'The college now meets all regulatory requirements.

'Obviously the fire assessments were reviewed when I was made aware of this by external contractors.'

The school, set in 70 acres of rolling Worcestershire countryside, was founded in 1974 and teaches GCSEs and A-Levels to predominantly rich foreign students. Each class has an average of just seven students.

Speaking
 after the sentencing, deputy chief officer Richard Lawrence, said lives had been put at risk.

He said: 'This was an extremely serious case where those living and sleeping 
inside the premises were being put at risk.

'Business owners have a 
clear responsibility to ensure that both the public and their employees 
are as safe as possible from the risk of fire.

'This verdict sends 
out a clear message: in severe cases where responsibilities are ignored,
 we will prosecute, as it is never acceptable to put lives at risk.'

The
 school, which boasts on its website about being in 'one of the safest 
and most beautiful areas of central England', is understood to be under 
the control of a limited company.

It is not the first time Kaveh has 
had a brush with the law. In October 2012 he was arrested after police 
found class A drugs in his car.

Forensic tests revealed the substance was 38g of opium with a street value of £100 but all charges were dropped.

Last August Kaveh was also accused of demolishing the garden of a couple whose property backs onto the boundary of the school.

And in June last year he was also fined £1,000 and ordered to pay £5,000 costs for misusing the title of ‘architect’.

The
 Architects Registration Board took action against Kaveh after it found 
he had continued to refer to himself as an architect even though his 
accreditation lapsed in March 2000.
