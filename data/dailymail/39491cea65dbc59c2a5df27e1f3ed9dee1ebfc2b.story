A former North Carolina corrections officer and bodybuilder who planned to fly to Syria to join ISIS pleaded guilty to terrorism charges on Thursday.

Donald Ray Morgan, 44, had been charged with attempting to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization and illegally possessing a firearm as a felon.

According to NBC, Morgan had originally been held by police after being arrested on the weapons charge at JFK airport. 

American jihadi: Don Morgan, 44, told NBC that it was his goal to go over to Syria to work in food or aid convoys or 'directly' support ISIS 

Investigators had been following his social media posts, and at a Brooklyn hearing, an FBI agent testified that Morgan had vowed support to ISIS online.

'Mujahid pledging allegiance to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and Islamic State commanding good and forbidding evil,' read a tweet from June 29 under the name Abu Omar al Amreeki.

He was then extradited to face trial in North Carolina for both the terrorism and weapons charges. 

Morgan was born to a Catholic family and originally had dreams of being in the US Special Forces and went to bootcamp around the time of Desert Storm.

He failed out of training and fell back on a career in law enforcement, becoming a sheriff's deputy and a corrections officer. 

That job he lost after a year and a half, Morgan began drinking heavily and partying. 

Convert: Friends said that Morgan (left), who converted to Islam in 2008, began to become more and more involved with the religion until it was his entire life by 2012 

Community: Morgan founded an Islamic community center in the US, but as his plans to enter Syria became more concrete, he began selling off possessions

He got into several fights, before going to prison for two years for firing a gun into a crowded restaurant.

Morgan briefly turned his life around through interest in bodybuilding, marrying fellow bodybuilder Tangela Horne in 1999 and having a son with her in 2001.

However in 2008, a year after he and Tangela divorced, Morgan converted to Islam, and in 2012 friends began to notice that the religion was becoming all-encompassing.

Morgan stopped going to the gym, grew his beard, shaved his head, opened an Islamic Center near to where he lived in Salisbury and began tweeting extremists views.

Bryan Beaver, who had known Morgan for 15 years, said: 'His Facebook posts were a bit extreme at times. Derogatory statements toward Israel, some statements about infidels.'

In his NBC interview. Morgan admits that his views could be viewed as radical by Westerners, but said that he considers himself to be just a 'practicing Muslim'.

He added that he was attracted to ISIS because he admired their devotion, and that fact that they put the worship of Islam above everything else.

In January this year he went to Lebanon to visit his second wife, and spent months trying to move across the border into Syria 'to join the most beautiful brothers on earth.'

He sold his belongings in the US in order to enter Syria through Turkey, but the government there stopped him in the airport in Istanbul.

'I purchased the ticket with the intent of entering to Syria, either joining up with medical and food aid convoys or directly with Islamic State,' he told NBC.

After the failed attempt, he attempted to return home to the US. A firearm he had attempted to sell online, in spite of being a convicted felon, led him to be taken into custody.
