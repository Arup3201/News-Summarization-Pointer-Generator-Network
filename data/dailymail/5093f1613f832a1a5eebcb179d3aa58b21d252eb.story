We've all heard of the chicken crossing the road - but on this occasion it was a giant sea lion.

The mammal brought traffic to a halt when it stopped on a zebra crossing in Chile - in the process recreating one of the Beatles' most famous album covers.

Business administrator Marcela Solis, 38, captured the astonishing scene - which resembles the cover of the Fab Four's seminal 1969 album Abbey Road - on his morning commute.

Road block: The sea lion waddled on to a busy road in Valdivia, Chile - but at least had the sense to use a zebra crossing

While sea lions are common in Valdivia, Chilean Marcela said he had never seen one on the road - let alone using a zebra crossing.

'We often see sea lions along the waterfront but it was very odd to see one using a crossing to get from one side to the other,' Solis said.

'It was fun to watch him cross so calmly.'

He added: 'It felt really strange watching him cross - I put it straight on to Facebook and my friends found it hilarious.

'I didn't expect it to get so much coverage but the image quickly went viral on social networking sites.

'I was just driving to work on Monday afternoon when I had to stop to let it past.'Â
