Clinging tightly to its mother, this adorable baby mongoose lemur peers out at the world - but its well-camouflaged hiding place makes it difficult to spot at times.

Wrapped in the security of its mother's fur, the baby is one of a rare set of twins born recently at the Busch Gardens wildlife park in Tampa, Florida.

The tiny animals weighed only 80 grams when first born - about the same as 30 pennies.

Clinging to its mother's side: Staff at the zoo are not yet sure whether the babies are male or female

They have since barely left their 17-year-old mother Rosalita's side, quite literally, as lemur babies cling to their parent's stomach.

So hidden are the youngsters, zoo staff at Busch Gardens are unsure whether the new arrivals are male or female.

All baby mongoose lemurs look the same at birth. However, when they reach the age of six to eight months, males start to change colour and develop their red beard and cheeks, while females have a darker face and white beard.

Mongoose lemurs are classified as a 
vulnerable species, and Busch Gardens takes part in Species Survival 
Plans initiated by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums to 
cooperatively manage breeding programs for threatened or endangered 
species in accredited institutions.

The
mongoose lemur is indigenous to the island of Madagascar in the Indian 
Ocean, but they are one of only two species of lemur to also live in an 
area outside the island.

Mongoose lemurs can be found on the Comoros Islands between Madagascar and Africa.
