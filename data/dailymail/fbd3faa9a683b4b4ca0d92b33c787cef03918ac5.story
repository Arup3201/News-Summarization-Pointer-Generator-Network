They say you need two hearts to play for him. They say that Monday to Friday he is hated by his squad but come match-day they love him.

Mauricio Pochettino has risen from a manager barely anyone in England had heard of 18 months ago to take charge of one of the biggest clubs in Europe.

Appointed by Tottenham in May, he faces the biggest challenges of his relatively short managerial career: a chairman with an itchy trigger finger, fans with high expectations and a squad of disjointed, expensive stars.

Hard task master: Mauricio Pochettino works his players hard in order to get results 

Pochettino is one of five Latin American bosses to grace the Premier League.

Ossie Ardiles (Tottenham — Jun 93 to Oct 94): Couldn’t replicate past success at the club and was sacked in his second season.

Luiz Felipe Scolari (Chelsea — Jun 08 to Feb 09): Axed after a post-Christmas slump in form.

Manuel Pellegrini (Man City — Jun 13 -): Won the league title and League Cup in his first season.

Gus Poyet (Sunderland - Oct 13 -): Dragged club from drop zone and led them to League Cup final.

Southampton supporters were furious when their former chief executive Nicola Cortese sacked local hero Nigel Adkins and brought in this unknown Argentine from Espanyol.

But he staved off relegation and a quarter of the way through last season the club stood third in the table. It was not down to luck. During last pre-season Pochettino often demanded triple training sessions from his players. They would train from 10am-midday, from 2pm-4pm and from 6pm-8pm.

One club source said: ‘The main change when he joined Southampton was that the intensity was stepped up.’

Pochettino will arrive at the training ground at 7am and won’t be gone until 7pm at the earliest.

During the season he lightens the load but is still unrelenting in his pursuit of fitness. In a typical week Monday is a rest day, but then on Tuesday and Wednesday he expects hard training again, often with double and occasionally triple sessions.

On Thursday it is lighter training and on Friday Pochettino does tactical work, looking specifically at the team’s next opponents.

Leading the way: Pochettino walks over hot coals

At Espanyol he fitted each player with GPS to detail their movement in training and would use an iPad to view a wider angle of games being filmed.

Maverick striker Dani Osvaldo played for him at Espanyol and then Southampton. ‘He makes you work like a dog,’ he said. ‘Sometimes you feel like killing him, but it works.’

One criticism, however, is that he does not hide his preference for certain members of his squad.

‘He has a tendency to have favourite players,’ said one source. ‘That worked OK at Southampton because they were a growing team. But at Spurs, where the players are more high-profile, that’s dangerous.’

Pochettino’s teams are energetic, constantly closing down their opponents. The players are like attack dogs set on the scent of the ball. He usually plays one up front with three attacking midfielders or forwards behind.

In possession they adhere to a strict passing philosophy. At goal kicks the centre halves drop wide around the penalty area, the full backs push 40 yards up the pitch and one of the two central midfielders moves to the edge of the box, giving the goalkeeper options to pass everywhere.

Midfielder James Ward-Prowse said: ‘It does feel like you need two hearts to play like that.’

Pochettino invests in youth, particularly young English players, something which attracted Levy to his appointment.

At Southampton he consistently played Ward-Prowse, 19, and gave first-team Premier League debuts to defender Calum Chambers, 19, striker Sam Gallagher, 18, and midfielder Harrison Reed, 19.

Southampton’s Jay Rodriguez flourished last season under Pochettino. He netted 17 times, earned a first England cap and was on the verge of Roy Hodgson’s World Cup squad until a knee injury ruled him out.

‘He brought the best out of me and gave me self-belief,’ Rodriguez said. ‘To work with him was brilliant, it was hard work but the lads loved it and we got results.

‘His tactical awareness gave you confidence, you wanted to go out for him because he’s such a great guy. You can talk to him. The players respected him so much.’

At Southampton they were prepared to walk over hot coals for him. Quite literally.

Pochettino brought in motivational speaker Xesco Espar. As the culmination of the session the Southampton squad were told to walk over hot coals. Pochettino led by example and went first. The players all followed him.

But Spurs chairman Daniel Levy has sacked eight managers in his 13 years at the club. Why will Pochettino be any different?

The Argentine shared a strong working relationship with Cortese. When the former Southampton chief executive threatened to leave the club last summer, Pochettino vowed to follow him out the door.

When the Swiss-Italian resigned in January this year, Pochettino was prepared to honour his word. But, over a glass of wine, Cortese persuaded him to stay.

One thing is very different for Pochettino in his new job. He will finally be speaking English in public, something he very rarely did at Southampton.

But he always spoke to his players without any problem, and on Saturday, when Spurs open the new season away at West Ham, we will find out whether the message got through.
