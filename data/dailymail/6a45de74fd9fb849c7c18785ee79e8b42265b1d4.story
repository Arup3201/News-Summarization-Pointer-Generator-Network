U.S. talk show host John Oliver has put Australia's plain packaging cigarette laws in the spotlight in his latest segment in which he takes on big tobacco companies.

The host of HBO's Last Week Tonight used his segment to demonstrate how cigarette brands use their power to fight against government health initiatives designed to reduce smoking rates in countries around the world.

Oliver began his segment by describing tobacco as: 'An aging product that's decreasing in popularity and yet somehow, it just can't stop making money. It's basically the agricultural equivalent of U2.'

In the 18-minute video he went on to discuss the lengths cigarette companies go to when faced with the introduction of laws that limit their ability to market to consumers – starting with the fight faced by the Australian Government before it introduced new cigarette branding laws in 2012.

'Australia's plain packaging laws banned tobacco company branding from packaging and replaced it with upsetting photos such as the toe tag on a corpse, the cancerous mouth, the nightmarish eyeball or the diseased lung,' he said.

'Perhaps unsurprisingly, since this law was implemented total consumption of tobacco and cigarettes in Australia fell to record lows… and nightmares about eyeballs have risen to record highs.'

He then pointed to a picture of a health warning on a cigarette package and joked: 'Take it down, take down the demon eye!'

Oliver made reference to Australian Department of Health statistics which show that consumption of cigarettes and tobacco fell to their lowest recorded levels ($3.405 billion) in the March quarter of 2014, down from $3.508 billion in the December quarter of 2012.

The talk show host then went on to suggest a 'compromise' with tobacco companies, allowing them to market their products using 'Jeff the Diseased Lung' as their mascot. 

Oliver encouraged people to tweet using the hashtag #JeffWeCan, which started trending on Twitter.

It's not the first time the popular HBO show – which has a large online fan base with more than 1.3 million subscribers on YouTube – has spoken about the Australian Government.

In June last year Oliver took a much less favourable look at Australia's political landscape by collating a series of Prime Minister Tony Abbott's biggest gaffes.
