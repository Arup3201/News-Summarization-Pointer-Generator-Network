Britain's last surviving Dambuster has called for the public to support a £1million appeal to help maintain a memorial to the men of Bomber Command.

Squadron Leader George 'Johnny' Johnson, 91, is backing the RAF Benevolent Fund's Upkeep Club, which is asking 1,000 people to donate £1,000 towards the memorial as it prepares to mark the 70th anniversary of the Dambusters raid this Thursday.

The club is named after the nickname given to the bouncing bombs that were dropped over Germany in the raid, designed by Sir Barnes Wallis.

Squadron Leader George 'Johnny' Johnson, the last surviving British Dambuster, has called for the public to help with the upkeep of the Bomber Command memorial

The Bomber Command Memorial was unveiled by the Queen in London's Green Park last June

'As a surviving veteran of 617 Squadron Dambusters raid, it is very gratifying to note the interest and respect afforded to the 70th anniversary of that operation,' he told the Daily Express.

'It is even more pleasing to know that, despite such a long wait, there is now a national and very fitting memorial to those comrades lost on the raid.'

'I extend my support and best wishes to the current efforts to raise the balance needed.'

The £7.5million bronze memorial in London's Green Park was unveiled by the Queen last June in tribute to the 55,573 men who died while serving in Bomber Command during the Second World War.

Almost half of the unit's 125,000 men did not come home while 8,400 were wounded and 10,000 taken prisoner.

Among the 113 Dambusters who flew 19 aircraft over Germany, 53 airmen were killed and three became prisoners of war.

The memorial's unveiling came after years of campaigning for Bomber Command to be properly recognised by Britain for their contribution to the battle against Nazi Germany, including the Operation Chastise bombing of the Möhne, Eder and Sorpe dams on May 16 and 17 1943.

Bee Gee singer Robin Gibb and 1970s pop star Jim Dooley were among the celebrities who led the fundraising efforts, with substantial donations from Lord Ashcroft, entrepreneur John Caudwell and businessman Richard Desmond. Mr Gibb died from liver and kidney failure a month before the unveiling.

Mr Dooley, told the Express: 'We are looking for 1,000 people to contribute £1,000 each. They can be individuals, companies or a group of supporters.

'They will get a badge, a tie and be invited to an annual celebration at the memorial.

'Their names will also be printed beside a photo of a Lancaster to be displayed in the RAF Club in London and RAF Museum in Hendon.'

Johnny Johnson served as a bomb aimer in pilot Joe McCarthy's crew, part of the squadron which was based at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire.

Today, he told the Mirror 
that he never doubted that he and his six crew mates would return home 
safely from the raid.

He 
said: 'The memories are still vivid and it’s ­something that will always
be with me. I’ve never talked about that night without being asked. I 
wasn’t sure people would be interested.

'I’m
asked how it feels to be the last British Dambuster. Well, excuse the 
language, I feel bloody lucky. I was in the right crew, in the right 
place at the right time and I feel honoured and privileged to have been 
able to take part.

'But surviving when so many didn’t come back was pretty shattering. There was an awful lot of loss – on both sides.'

The widower, who lives in Bristol, is the last living Briton among the airmen, who were made up of volunteers and experienced personnel from Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United States.

He retired from the Royal Air Force in 1962 and became a junior school teacher.

He and his late wife Gwyn have three children, eight grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren from their 62-year marriage. Gwyn, who served as a WRAF radio operator, died in 2005.

Sergeant Fred Sutherland, from Canada, and Flight Lieutenant Les Munro from New Zealand, are the only other living Dambusters.

The squadron was assembled by Wing Commander Guy Gibson with only 11 weeks to prepare for their mission.

They were not told that they would be bombing the Ruhr Valley until six hours before the raid began, following weeks of practice over Peak District reservoirs.

617 Squadron, the team assembled by Wing Commander Guy Gibson, had only 11 weeks to prepare for their mission

On the night of May 16, the 19 Lancasters carrying 113 crewmen took off in three waves along two different routes to bomb the dams.

Gibson attacked first at the Möhne at 12.28am, but five bombs were dropped before it was breached.

The
first wave’s three remaining aircraft with bombs then attacked the Eder
which finally collapsed at 1.52am. Aircraft from the other two waves 
bombed the Sorpe but it remained intact.

They shot at a train - and got a blast from a goods train's armament in
return.

The shot pierced a tyre and blasted through the wing and undercarriage before embedding in the roof above the navigator's head. It narrowly missed the petrol tanks.

The heroics of that night were immortalised in the 1955 film The Dambusters, starring Richard Todd and Michael Redgrave as Bomber Command head Sir Arthur 'Bomber' Harris and Barnes Wallis respectively.

This Thursday, Sqn Ldr Johnson will return to RAF Scampton for anniversary celebrations and a sunset ceremony, to be shown on BBC2.
