Manchester United midfielder Ander Herrera has proclaimed his innocence in the face of allegations of match-fixing in Spain.

Herrera and Swansea midfielder Jefferson Montero are among 41 players, coaches and directors named in an investigation.

Prosecutors allege almost €1million (£795,000) was used to pay Levante players to lose their match against Real Zaragoza at the end of the 2010-11 season.

Manchester United star Ander Herrera has said he knew nothing of the match-fixing that involved his old club Real Zaragoza at the end of the 2010-11 season when Levante players were allegedly paid to throw a game

Herrera is one of 41 people cited as possible witnesses in the ongoing legal proceedings

Herrera said: ‘In an on-going legal process involving Real Zaragoza (Spain), the club I was honoured to play for from 12 until 22 years of age, there are 41 people cited as possible witnesses, of which I am one.

'I have never had and will never have anything to do with manipulating match results.

'If I am ever called to testify in any judicial hearing, I’ll be happy to attend, as my conscience is totally clear.

'I love football and I believe in fair play, both on and off the pitch.’

A Swansea spokesman said: 'We have had no contact regarding this matter.'

Prosecutor Luzon filed the case at a court in Valencia on Monday.

The court document alleges Herrera was one of 10 people who withdrew tens of thousands of euros funded by Zaragoza in order to pay bribes.

Herrera left home-town club Zaragoza to join Athletic Bilbao in August 2011 and moved to United last summer

Swansea's Jefferson Montero, who was in the Levante side who lost to Zaragoza, is also involved

The 25-year-old left Zaragoza to join his home-town club Athletic Bilbao in August 2011, before signing for United in June this year.

Montero, who joined Swansea from Mexican club Monarcas Morelia in July, was in the Levante side beaten 2-1 by Zaragoza on 21 May, 2011.

It is alleged Levante’s players were paid to lose the match, which Zaragoza needed to win to avoid relegation.

Montero’s alleged involvement is not described in the prosecution case.

Also named in the document are the current Atletico Madrid captain Gabi and Zaragoza’s former coach, Javier Aguirre - now manager of the Japan national side.

Zaragoza's former coach Javier Aguirre, now in charge of Japan, is also caught up in the allegations

Aguirre claimed his innocence on December 5, telling Japan Football Association lawyer Yutaka Miyoshi that he was 'very angry and that he has never done such a thing as a professional coach.' The Japanese association has backed their coach. 

Gabi recently admitted that he received a transfer of 85,000 euros from Zaragoza at the time of the game in question but he immediately returned it to the then-owner of the club, Angelo Inglesias.

He told El Mundo: 'I did what Agapito asked me to do. I'm unaware if the money went to Levante players or what happened to that money.'

Asked whether he regarded the money transfer as suspicious, Gabi replied: 'As the club was going into bankruptcy, I thought it was.'
