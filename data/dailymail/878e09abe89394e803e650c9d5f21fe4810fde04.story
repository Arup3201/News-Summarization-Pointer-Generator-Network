A frisson of pain suddenly broke out on Novak Djokovic’s face after he slipped on the worn baseline and crumpled on the hard turf of Centre Court.

His left shoulder had landed smack on the ground and, for a few moments in the third set, his progress in the tournament was potentially in jeopardy. He lay on the floor, his painful joint being manipulated by healing hands.

Making light of the trouble, he closed out the match to maintain a remarkable record: he will now play his 21st consecutive Grand Slam fourth round and his sixth successively at Wimbledon, against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.

Ouoch: Novak Djokovic falls heavily during his match against Gilles Simon

Tumble: Djokovic takes a fall during the third set but he recovered to win

Worry: Djokovic received treatment on his left shoulder during the third set before wrapping up victory

‘It was a scary fall,’ recalled Djokovic. ‘I had a strong impact. When I stood up, I felt a click or pop. I feared it might be dislocated or a joint problem.

‘Going out in that way would be the worst possible exit. But luckily it had a minor effect on the joint and the muscle around it. I had ultrasound but it’s all looking good.’

Consistency was not the story of Djokovic’s performance on Friday. No sooner had he broken his French opponent Gilles Simon’s erratic serve than he would be broken back.

Yes, Simon was pesky but Djokovic was undone as much by his own shifts of mood. The Serb lost service games in all three sets and more than once threw his arms wide in disbelief and whacked loose balls high into the sky in exasperation.

The world No 2 has not won a Grand Slam since last year’s French Open and he will need to develop as the fortnight continues if he is to add a seventh major title to his cv.

Treatment: Djokovic's shoulder was tended to before he resumed to complete his victory

‘There are things in my game I would like to improve in a few days and see if I can do better in the next match,’ he said.

‘But, for now, everything is going in the right direction and I hope that I will elevate my game as the tournament progresses. If I don’t do that, I’ll find myself in a very difficult position.’

There were a few faux-amusing moments. A male voice from the crowd shouted: ‘I love you Novak.’ Novak put his thumb up. One doubts Djokovic’s girlfriend Jelena Ristic was worried.

When, a little while later, someone — perhaps the same humourist — shouted; ‘I love you Boris,’ the remark fell flat.

The Boris in question was of course his coach Boris Becker, the three-time Wimbledon champion who sat impassively in the box until Djokovic won and turned towards his supporting cast. Djokovic clenched his fist; Becker clapped his hands.

‘I talked with Boris,’ said Djokovic. ‘We obviously need to work on my diving volleys, learning how to fall down on the court. I’m not very skilful in that.’ He was smiling as he said it.

‘Where he helps me the most and where I feel the biggest change is from a mental point of view,’ he added. ‘Obviously it is going to take a little time for us to find the perfect balance and for the work to be reflected on court with results.

No reply: Simon had his chances against Djkokovic but couldn't take advantage

‘But we already have a couple of titles together. We have the final of the French Open. It’s already starting to build up. I am starting to feel the effect of his advice and his presence.’

Djokovic at least has two clear days before playing Tsonga, the 29-year-old Frenchman who was his semi-final victim in 2011.

What does he expect? ‘I don’t fear anything,’ said Djokovic. ‘I expect him to serve well. Coming to the net, he’s a very aggressive player. If he feels good on the day, he can beat anybody.’
