'He ain't heavy': Martin Amrising (right) saved his friend Kevin Brockbank's life by landing heavily on his chest when trying to stop him falling off his chair

A man who collapsed and 'died' at work had his life saved when his heart was literally jump-started by a friend who fell on him.

Father-of-two Kevin Brockbank, 54, keeled over after suffering a massive heart attack during a coffee break.

Colleague Martin Amriding panicked and reached out to grab his friend of 35 years - but as Kevin slumped to the floor he was dragged down with him.

Engineer Martin, who weighs 15 stone, fell onto Kevin's chest - and the impact kick-started his heart.

Paramedics raced to the scene and rushed Kevin to hospital - where doctors confirmed Martin's fall saved his life.

Father-of-two Martin, of Preston, Lancashire, said: 'I saw Kevin was going to fall off his chair so I tried to catch him, but he pulled me right over the chair.

'It was only afterwards that the paramedic told me I had saved his life by falling on him.

'I felt awful when I fell on him because I thought I'd really hurt him - then I found out I'd actually saved his life.

'I was gobsmacked. I still haven't really got my head round what happened. I'm just glad to see he is all right. It wasn't exactly a textbook resuscitation but it seemed to do the trick.'

The near-death experience happened at a printing press in Dundee, where both men work as service engineers.

Kevin, who lives in Ayr, Ayrshire, said: 'I remember feeling unwell and the next thing I knew I was on the floor with Martin on top of me, which is remarkable in itself because he weighs about 15 stone.

'We were in the canteen having a coffee and a chat when I started to feel unwell and suddenly it felt like I had been hit in the chest by a sledgehammer.

'I could feel my eyes rolling back in my head and I slumped down. I started to fall over so Martin tried to grab me, but I must have dragged him over the chair with me.

'Afterwards I was told my heart had stopped beating for about a minute and both the paramedic and the surgeon said it was the thud of Martin falling on me that saved my life, in the same way CPR chest compressions would.

'It's certainly a strange situation to have been in. But if it hadn't been for Martin falling on me I wouldn't be here.'

Martin visited Kevin every day as he recovereda at Dundee's Ninewells Hospital

Kevin suffered four more cardiac arrests in the ambulance but was revived by paramedics following the incident in October.

He was taken to Dundee's Ninewells Hospital - where he was visited by Martin every day - and only given a 50 per cent chance of survival.

But he underwent an operation to insert a stent in his heart to unblock the main artery and was discharged ten days later.

He later suffered two minor strokes and was re-admitted to hospital, where he underwent operations to remove blood clots in his legs, heart and kidneys.

Leading cardiologist Dr Frank Dunn, of Glasgow, said: 'It's quite possible to startsomeone's heart with a thump to the chest.

'It appears that the weight of this man has done this. He is very lucky to be alive.'
