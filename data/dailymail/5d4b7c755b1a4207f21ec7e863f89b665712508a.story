In 2002 England's Under 17 side competed in the first ever UEFA European Under 17 Championships - a competition that featured a 16-year-old  Wayne Rooney.

The former Everton striker's career exploded over the next decade, with success that included winning the Champions League, Premier League and FA Cup. 

But as the England captain prepares to make his 100th appearance for his country, some of his former team-mates will be wondering where it all went so wrong. Sportsmail takes a look at what happened to the rest of that Under 17 squad.
