The tedious search to find a parking space in a busy city will soon be a thing of the past – in Pisa, Italy, at least.

Testing of an intelligent parking system is under way in the home of the Leaning Tower, which helps drivers find a suitable space to park their car and pay for the space quickly.

It combines sensors on the floors of spaces, boards across the city and smart street lighting to help drivers find parking spots at the touch of a button.

The pilot scheme was created as a partnership between Deutsche Telekom and Kiunsys.

The new smart city service has been installed on Piazza Carrara, which is located directly on the banks of the river Arno.

Sensors on the floor of each parking spot detect whether they are free or occupied, while several data units collect the information and send it over the mobile network to the city's server infrastructure.

The information is then displayed on indication panels, which guide drivers to a free space.

Drivers can choose to pay for their parking using Pisa’s existing Tap&Park app – which integrates with the new system.

‘The new parking system integrates seamlessly into our intelligent transport system (ITS),’ the mayor of Pisa, Marco Filippeschi, said. ‘It eases the flow of traffic and helps to cut CO2 emissions.’

For years, Pisa has been working on a smart mobility policy as part of its Sustainable Energy Action Plan.

Mayor Filippeschi said: ‘The pilot project is a big stride for Pisa towards improving its traffic situation over the long term.

‘Indeed, drivers looking for a parking space make up some 30 percent of inner-city traffic. So the easier it is for them to find a spot, the less traffic there will be.’

Around 90,000 motorists take to the city’s roads every day as Pisa is not only a tourist destination, but is home to three universities, a high profile hospital and the main airport of Tuscany.

Pisa has been using Kiunsys’ Tap&Park app for mobile paymet for years, as well as 30,000 RFID ‘Pisa Pass’ parking badges and its INeS Cloud management software.

Pisa has already been using a range of modules from Deutsche Telekom's partner company Kiunsys for several years. These include the Tap&Park app for mobile payment of parking charges, 30,000 RFID parking badges – known as 'PisaPass' – and INeS Cloud management.

Tiziano Di Sciullo, Sales Manager at Kiunsys, said: ‘The modular solution can digitally map all processes relating to parking facility management and traffic in the city.’

As a result, Pisa has already been collecting traffic-related data over the past few years, which will now be analysed as part of the pilot project.

The partners hope to gain a deeper insight into how the traffic infrastructure is used, which will benefit traffic planning in future.

A robot named 'Ray' (pictured) has been developed to help spatially-challenged drivers fit into tight spaces by automatically parking their car for them. The technology, currently being used at Düsseldorf International Airport, claims to be able to park 60 per cent more vehicles in one area compared with a human driver

A robot named ‘Ray’ has been developed to help spatially-challenged drivers fit into tight spaces by automatically parking their car for them.

The technology, currently being used at Düsseldorf International Airport, claims to be able to park 60 per cent more vehicles in one area compared to a human driver.

A driver leaves their car at a Vehicle Transfer Station (VTS), which uses laser scanners to measure the precise height and width of the vehicle.

The system then calculates the position of the vehicle’s wheels and measures other key parts such as the wing mirrors and the bumper.

Once this is done, the driver is issued with a ticket from a terminal where they can leave their vehicle in Ray’s mechanical 'hands'.

Ray has four wheels that can turn a full 360-degrees, allowing it to manoeuvre into extremely tight spaces.

Approaching from the side, Ray picks up the car by sliding one set of its forks each under its front and rear wheels.

The car is then transported to the parking spot selected by the system’s software. When a driver wants their car back, they pay the ticket and their vehicle will be brought to a nearby VTS.
