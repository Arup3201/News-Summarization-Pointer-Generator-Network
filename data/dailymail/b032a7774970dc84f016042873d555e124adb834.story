Scotland international Geoff Cross has completed his year-long beard growing fundraiser after it was shaved off at his club's training ground on Tuesday.

The London Irish prop created a lot of interest during the Six Nations championship with the beard and has raised £10,000 for rugby's children's charity Wooden Spoon - dedicated to transforming the lives of disadvantaged children and young people across the British Isles through rugby.

His efforts are also helping raise funds for his former club-mate at Edinburgh, John Houston, who is seeking £50,000 to compete in the Wooden Spoon Arctic Rugby Challenge.

Setting off on April 15, the challenge aims to set a world record for the most northerly rugby match in history after a trek of 100 miles to the magnetic North Pole.

When asked if he did indeed have the greatest beard in rugby, Cross said: 'It's really not my place to say but I'm very proud of it.
