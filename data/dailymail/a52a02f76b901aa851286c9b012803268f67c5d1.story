Prosecutors have requested that an Anglo-Italian bunga bunga girl turned politician be put on trial for fiddling her expenses.

Former dental hygienist Nicole Minetti, who was catapulted into politics by Silvio Berlusconi after helping to recruit girls for his bunga bunga parties, is one of 62 politicians from the Lombardy region investigated for submitting expenses for items including lottery scratch cards, bullets, cigarettes, takeaway pizzas and fireworks.

Minetti, whose British mother runs a dance school in Rimini, is accused of spending €832 at a Milan hotel and buying an iPad after submitting a claim for 19,000 euros.

She was reimbursed for sushi dinners, items from IKEA, and even submitted claim for 16 euros for a book about the bunga bunga scandal.

The book Mignottocrazia, which translates as 'Whoreocracy', featured a cartoon of herself in an apparent S&M scenario on the cover.

Minetti is currently appealing a five year sentence for acting as Berlusconi's pimp in organising girls for his lewd dinners.

The former prime minister's trial for sex with Ruby the Heart Stealer heard that at one party she dressed up as a nun before performing a striptease.

She and another woman allegedly donned black habits and crucifixes to perform a pole dance before stripping to their underwear.

Prosecutors estimate the regional councillors submitted three million in fraudulent expenses in three years between 2008 al 2011, a preliminary report submitted to judges and seen by Italian newspaper La Repubblica said.

Shamefully, spending on electronics including smartphone tablet cameras-the expenses increased dramatically at Christmas time.

Stefano Gallo of the far right Northern league party was alleged to have successfully claimed 6,000 euros for his daughter's wedding banquet.

Other outrageous claims includes 61.50 euros at the butcher, 600 euros for cannoli and cakes, and 391 euros for 24,1 kg of salami and 14 kilos of sausages.

Meanwhile, Italy's President Giorgio Napolitano testified for more than three hours on Tuesday in an unprecedented appearance in a major trial that accuses the state of holding secret talks with the Sicilian Mafia in the 1990s.

Palermo prosecutors seeking to shed light on a murky period when the mob targeted the state with assassinations and bombings questioned a sitting head of state in a mafia trial for the first time in the country's history.

Among the defendants are Nicola Mancino, who was interior minister at the time and is charged with giving false testimony, and Salvatore Riina, once Italy's most powerful mafia boss.

Riina and eight others in the dock face charges of trying to blackmail the state. All deny any wrongdoing.

The 89-year-old Napolitano is not accused of any crime. He was called as a witness who may have knowledge useful to the trial, but the hearing may tarnish the image of a president who has guided Italy in a period of political and economic turmoil.

Napolitano responded to questions with the 'maximum amount of transparency and serenity' and without invoking his constitutional right to remain silent, a statement from the president's office said afterward.

'He said he had been a spectator to the events (of 1992-93), nothing more,' Luca Cianferoni, lawyer for the Corleone-born mob boss Riina, told reporters outside the president's Quirinale Palace where the closed-door hearing took place.

Prosecutors allege senior politicians and police, hoping to stem mounting violence, held talks with mob bosses after anti-mafia magistrate Giovanni Falcone, his wife and three bodyguards were killed by a mafia bomb planted under a road in 1992.

The state's willingness to enter into talks after Falcone's murder actually encouraged further bombings, the prosecutors say, including the one that killed another anti-mafia magistrate, Paolo Borsellino, two months later.

At the time of the bombings, Napolitano was president of Italy's Chamber of Deputies, the lower house of parliament. He became Italy's president in 2006.

Prosecutors asked the head of state about a 2012 letter to him from his legal adviser Loris D'Ambrosio that referred to 'unspeakable agreements' and implied that Napolitano had known about the talks.

'The president never spoke explicitly of a negotiation' between the state and mafia, and he called talk about any unspeakable agreements 'conjecture without any objective elements of proof,' said Nicoletta Piergentili, a defense lawyer.
