The devastated owners of a rental property left with $20,000 worth of damage are desperately trying to track down the tenants who they believe left it in a disgusting state of disrepair.

Val Douskova discovered her Heathridge house, in Perth, Western Australia, covered in obscene graffiti and its windows smashed when she returned to it on Friday.

Alongside drawings of male genitalia and phrases such as ‘f**k you’ scrawled across the walls and fridge, Mrs Douskova also found egg yolk on the walls and a kitchen sink stinking of urine.

Photos of the destruction show rubbish all over the floors, including pizza boxes, empty takeaway boxes and torn up paper.

The last couple that lived in the property also allegedly owe Mrs Douskova over $4,000 in rent after they stopped paying it in December.

The house was covered in obscene graffiti and its windows smashed after the former tenants moved out 

The devastated owners, who are experienced in property management, have been lumped with a $20,000 repair bill 

Mrs Douskova and her husband spent three months trying to evict the couple, who are named on the lease as Jeff De Florenca and Marit Johansen, before a court order was issued. Bills at the house show their names spelt with three different variations. 

But the family reportedly fled leaving the horrific mess before the sheriff bailiffs came to the house to evict them.

Mrs Douskova’s son Peter Dousek told Daily Mail Australia the couple first moved in on a six month contract on June 10 2012. He explained that his parents are very experienced in property management and had run all the appropriate credit checks. 

On December 11 2012, they signed a 12 month rental agreement and then on December 12 2013 automatically went on a verbal periodic tenancy agreement.

'Everything was good for two years and my dad did frequent inspections... he was regularly over the house doing bits and pieces,' Mr Dousek said.

On January 4 2014, the couple were given a notice for not paying rent.

‘By the 4 of January 2014 they owed $2,637 which includes the overdue water bills. They said they will borrow some money from their friends as they still want to live in the property,’ Mr Dousek recalled.

‘My parents are good people and were willing to give them a chance to repay the outstanding balance and to stay in the property,’ he said.

Then in December 5 2014 they started not paying their rent again.

The landlords issued a notice and eventually took the matter to court.

On March 3, Peter’s mother drove past the house and found the property abandoned.

‘When my mum walked into the property she found the place turned upside down and trashed,’ Mr Dousek said.

Much of the language scrawled on the walls of the property and the fridge is to obscene to be published

Mr Douesek explained how even his parents landlord insurance doesn't cover all the costs of the damaga  

‘There was rubbish everywhere, large amounts of graffiti on the walls with abusive language directed to my father, rotten eggs smashed all over the carpets and walls, found they urinated in the bedrooms, broken ceiling fans, big chips in the walls and a lot more, too much to list.’

Mr Dousek said his mother has filed a police report and they are awaiting further instructions.They need to find the couple before they can take them to court.

'Landlord insurance doesn't cover everything, there are a lot of costs that aren't covered... there are also such massive flaws in tenancy laws,' Mr Douesek said.

'For example landlords need to keep the tenants stuff for 90 days legally... it's been egged and peed and you've got keep it on the property for three months just in case they come back.'
