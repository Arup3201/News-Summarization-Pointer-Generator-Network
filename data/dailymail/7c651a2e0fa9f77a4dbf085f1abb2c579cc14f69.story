What does two times six equal? In this case, it’s a dozen twins - all starting at the same primary school on the same day.

The remarkable line-up of four-year-olds is likely to require double the concentration for teachers and classmates.

But yesterday they were looking forward to ensuring they can put the right names to all the new faces.

Matched up: Six sets of twins are starting in this year's foundation class at Montpelier Primary School in Plymouth, Devon. They are (from left) Prithvi and Vidhusha Ananth, Beau and Evelyn Moore, Naomi and Lola Gray, Dragon and Tiger Tang, Zachary and Finlay Francombe, and Jack and Thomas Lewin

In a line: Jack and Thomas Lewin, Beau and Evelyn Moore, Naomi and Lola Gray, Dragon and Tiger Tang, Zachary and Finlay Francombe, and Prithvi and Vidhusha Ananth

Beau and Evelyn Moore: First reports said the twins were delighted to find themselves in the company of other twins and were happily getting to know one another

It will be good practice - because 
with multiple births on the increase, teachers up and down the country 
will see more matching pairs of siblings starting school life together.

The
 two identical and four non-identical sets of twins are enjoying their 
first full week at Montpelier Primary School in Plymouth, Devon.

‘We are very lucky to have them all with us,’ said headteacher Jason Holland. 

‘We’ve never known this many sets of twins to start, but it hasn’t been too much of a logistical problem.

Thumbs up: Prithvi and Vidhusha Ananth (left), and Jack and Thomas Lewin (right). In 2012 there were 11,228 sets of twins born in England and Wales

Starting school together: Zachary and Finlay Francombe. About one in every 64 births in the UK today is twins, triplets or more

‘It has been school policy to try to 
split sets of twins up where possible, and we’ve managed to do that 
across the three foundation classes.

Fraternal or non-identical twins are produced when two egg cells are fertilized separately.

Identical or monozygotic twins are formed when one fertilized egg divides. All women have approximately the same chance of having identical twins – about one in 350 to 400.

Identical twins do not run in families. However, there are some factors that make having non-identical twins more likely:

‘The
 whole idea then is that the twins can be mutually exclusive, can branch
 out on their own and have separate groups of friends.’

Despite best intentions, there were still a few tears on a nerve-racking first day, and not just for the children.

Kate
 Lewin, mother of Jack and Thomas, said: ‘They’re my first to start 
school, so it’s been exciting and upsetting all at the same time.

‘At one point I was walking up to 
their classroom door with one gripped around each leg.

They’re so close,
 so one crying just sets the other one off. But it’s lovely that they’ve
 got other twins to make friends with.’

Stephanie
 Gray, mother of Lola and Naomi, said: ‘It’s just so bizarre, isn’t it?

'I
 never thought there would be this many sets of twins starting at the 
same time.

'My two are used to being unique, and now they’re two in a 
crowd. It’s lovely to see though.’

First
 reports said the twins were delighted to find themselves in the company
 of other twins and were happily getting to know one another.

Dressed in matching green uniforms, they were also helping to remind class teachers who was who.

Many multiple births are a happy surprise but experts say numbers are increasing because of the rise in infertility treatments and the fact women are leaving it later to have children.

In 2012 there were 11,228 sets of twins born in England and Wales, compared to 8,776 in 1998. About one in every 64 births in the UK today is twins, triplets or more.

Jane Denton, director of the Multiple Births Foundation, based at London’s Hammersmith Hospital, said: ‘In recent years and because of infertility treatments, the number of twins born has been rising.’

She supported the policy adopted by many schools to try to separate twins if possible.

‘Each twin relationship should be looked at to see what suits the children best but being in separate classes can bring huge benefits,’ she said.

‘It’s important for teachers, friends and everybody to see them as individuals.’
