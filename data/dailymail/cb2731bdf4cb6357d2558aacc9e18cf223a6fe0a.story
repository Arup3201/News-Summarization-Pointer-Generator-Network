A yo-yo slimmer has lost half her body weight - for the second time in her life.

Paula Hebblethwaite was overweight as a teenager and reached 14st, before losing six stone in order to look good on her wedding day in 1993

But she put all the weight back on again over the following 20 years due to unhealthy eating.

Paula Hebblethwaite, 45, has lost half of her body weight for the second time in her life (left) - shedding 8st. She initially lost 6st before her wedding in 1993 but then piled the weight back on (right)

Mrs Hebblethwaite (pictured with her husband, 
Robert, on her wedding day in 1993) went on a calorie counting diet and 
lost 6st so as to look good in her size eight wedding dress

The 45-year-old from Portland, Dorset, has now lost half of her 16st bulk after going on a second major diet.

The
mother-of-one, who is less than 5ft tall, realised she had to something
about her size after her father, John Trevett, died and she started 
thinking about her own health.

She feared her obesity would result in an early death.

She said: ‘Doctors said he had a bad 
heart and his arteries had become blocked. It worried me because he was a
slim, healthy man.

Mrs Hebblethwaite (pictured with her husband in 1990, before her first diet) is less than 5ft tall and says that her BMI was 'off the scale'

‘I wondered what kind of condition my heart would be in, and I knew my BMI was off the chart.’

She decided to register with a slimming group and has spent two years slimming down to a trim 7st 13lbs.

Mrs Hebblethwaite said: ‘I guess you 
could say I am a yo-yo slimmer, although I did it in a completely 
different way the second time around.

‘The first time was all about calorie counting and reducing the portions that I ate.

‘It worked because I lost six stone and wore a size eight dress for my wedding.

‘But it wasn’t sustainable as I piled on the weight as soon as I started eating normal portions again.’

After her father died, Mrs Hebblethwaite (pictured with her daughter in 2009) became worried about her weight. Her father had died young despite being slim and fit

The second time, Mrs Hebblethwaite, whose husband Robert works away on a dredger, joined a local Slimming World class.

Her diet used to include cakes, sweets and chocolate but she has cut that out and eats lean meat, vegetables, salad, low-fat yoghurts, fish, and allows herself treats in moderation.

She said: ‘Every time Robert came 
home from being away at sea he would tell me I looked different and even
once said “you’ve lost one of your chins”.

‘It was the motivation I needed to carry on.

‘I
am hoping to stay at this size now, I feel much healthier and happier 
and I don’t think I could lose all the weight for a third time.’

Mrs Hebblethwaite joined Slimming World, adopted a healthier diet and dropped from 16st to 7st 13lbs. Her husband, Robert, works away on a dredger and says she looked different every time he came home
