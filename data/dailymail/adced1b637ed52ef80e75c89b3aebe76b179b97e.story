And now the Hidden Beach, officially called Playa De Amor, or the 'Beach of Love', has shot to fame after gaining a huge following across social media.

To reach the secluded marvel, visitors have to swim through a short tunnel which opens up into the spectacular beach, which is surrounded by rare wildlife.

Ventura Osorio, who provides tours to the Hidden Beach, said the islands were formed thousands of years ago by volcanic rock activity.

Hidden gem: The island is just a few miles off the coast of Mexico and has been attracting more visitors as it becomes more widely publicised

Ventura, 34, from Puerto Vallarta, 
Mexico, explained: 'The beach itself was most likely formed prior to the First World War
 since the Mexican government had been using the islands as target 
practice. These controlled bombings have been said to have formed 
numerous caves and other unique rock formations on the Marietas Islands.

'It is believed that the Hidden 
Beach was created as a result of these factors combined with the 
erosion of the rocks surrounding it due to the local weather conditions.'

Spectacular wildlife including 
humpback whales, dolphins and manta rays are just some of the stunning 
marine life visitors get to enjoy when at the beach.

It has been discovered and become a 
popular destination to visit after going viral on social networking site
 like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

Mr Ventura added: 'Without social media,
 the hidden beach would just be another beach waiting to be discovered 
by the world. This beach became famous around the world through Twitter,
 Facebook, YouTube, Tumblr, Pinterest, Instagram, you name it.

'Puerto Vallarta is a very popular 
tourist destination in Mexico and now that there is awareness, the 
amount of visitors the hidden beach receives had gown astronomically.'

The Marietas Islands are a Natural 
Reserve protected by the Mexican Government and in order to visit the 
hidden beach, visitors must have a permit.
