Armed with semi-automatic machine guns, their faces covered with balaclavas, these dramatic pictures show how police swooped on a quiet street as the hunt for two men suspected of gunning down a father and son in a gangland shooting intensified.

Dozens of officers descended in armoured vehicles to surround a road in Droylsden, Greater Manchester in the hunt for one-eyed Dale Cregan, 29, of 
Droylsden, and Anthony Wilkinson, 33, of Beswick.

Both fugitives are wanted in 
connection with David Short's murder while Mr Cregan is also suspected of killing Mr Short's son Mark, 23, who was shot in the neck as he played pool in the Cotton Tree Inn in Droylsden in May.

Arrests: Dozens of armed officers in balaclavas and bullet proof vests surrounded a red car in York Road, in Droylsden, Greater Manchester as the hunt for two murder suspects intensified on Tuesday

Drama: Police carried guns as they swooped on the road in full view of shocked neighbours who gathered behind police cordons to watch the drama unfold. A 28-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder

David Short, 46, was blasted to death on his driveway in a gun and grenade 
attack in Clayton, Greater Manchester last Friday.

On Tuesday, police immediately cornered a red car in York Road, Droylsden and, after searching homes, arrested a 28-year-old man on suspicion of murder in full view of shocked neighbours who gathered behind police cordons to watch the drama unfold.

At least three armoured assault Land Rovers, two police dog units and 
dozens of marked police cars were at the scene. At one point officers 
appeared to be going from door to door in search of the two wanted men, who are still at large.

Airports and ports are on alert 
in 
the hunt for Mr Cregan and Mr Wilkinson, who are also wanted for a 
second grenade attack just nine minutes after David Short's death, in 
nearby Droylsden.

The public have been warned not 
to approach either men.

Yesterday it emerged that David Short's killers tried to cover their tracks by
blowing up a getaway van.

Images of the white Vauxhall Combo and
new details of its movements have been released as part of a hunt for the suspects.

The images show the van's bodywork peppered with holes from ball bearings packed inside a grenade.

Police believe the grenade - which is 
not thought to be of British origin - was detonated inside in a bid to 
destroy the van and evidence.

Detectives said the van, which was 
hired legitimately from Salford Van Hire at 4.40pm last Thursday, was 
found abandoned at the end of Luke Road, near the entrance to Lees Park,
shortly after Friday's attacks.

They believe it was used by the 
killers to travel between Clayton and Droylsden.

Pictures released by police show Mr 
Cregan with a fake onyx eye - although he is believed to have several 
normal looking eyes in different colours.

He apparently told friends he lost his eye after being hit with a knuckle duster during a fight with police in Thailand.

The Short family have been at 
loggerheads with a rival family for more than 10 years but it spilled 
into bloodshed in May when Mark Short was killed.

It
is understood David Short vowed revenge for his son's death and had 
threatened to murder relatives of his son's killer in retaliation.

It is believed he may have been killed in a 'pre-emptive strike'.

It is also understood that Mr Short had
been repeatedly warned that his life was in danger and had taken to 
wearing a bulletproof vest as far back as eight years ago.

By 2004, police had issued him with 
three 'Osman' warnings - served when officers receive intelligence that 
someone is at risk of serious harm or being killed.

They can lead to people being placed under police protection.

In 2006 Short was jailed for six years
for possessing a firearm with intent, after he and his late son Mark 
drove a gunman away from a street where shots were fired in broad 
daylight.

Six months after 
the shooting Short battered a man during a drunken row at the Garibaldi 
pub in Gorton, which led to a conviction for wounding.

Short
had been in the dock years earlier when, back in the nineties, he was 
accused of intimidating a witness after threatening a woman while 
wearing a balaclava.

At least three armoured assault Land Rovers, two police dog units and dozens of marked police cars were at the scene. At one point officers appeared to be going from door to door in search of the two wanted men

Short's son Mark also had a history of violence.

He
admitted firearms offences following the 2006 incident involving his 
father, but was spared a stint in a young offenders' institution.

But,
by 2008 he had been locked up for five years - and branded a dangerous 
young man by a judge sentencing him for robbery and grievous bodily 
harm.

The amateur boxer had been one of a gang of three who carjacked a 60-year-old man in Clayton.

Short had gone on to knock a shopkeeper unconscious in an attack three months later.

Asst Chief Constable Steve Heywood, 
said: 'Over the past few days, an intensive police operation has been 
underway to identify and trace those involved in these violent attacks, 
which have left one man dead.

Cordon: Emergency services, including an Army bomb disposal unit were deployed 
to two addresses near Manchester after David Short's murder on Friday. He was gunned down on his driveway

'Armed officers have also been patrolling in the Clayton and Droylsden areas to provide reassurance to residents.

'While we do not believe these two attacks were random, people in the area are understandably concerned by what has happened.

'We are continuing to look for two men - Cregan and Wilkinson - who we want to speak to in connection with Friday's attacks.

'We are urging any members of the 
public who have seen them since Friday morning, or who know where they 
are now, to contact us immediately. Please do not try and approach these
men, but call the police on 999.'

Three men, aged 37, 25 and 28, have been arrested on suspicion of the murder of David Short and two have been bailed.

Four men have been charged with the murder of Mark Short.
