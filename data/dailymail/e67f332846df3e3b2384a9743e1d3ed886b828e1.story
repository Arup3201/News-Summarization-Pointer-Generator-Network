A rogue U.S. soldier planned to detonate bombs at Fort Hood and then shoot the survivors, authorities said yesterday.

Private First Class Naser Jason Abdo has been indicted on six counts for plotting to blow up a restaurant full of troops near the Texas Army post this summer.

The 21-year-old will be tried on one count of trying to use a weapon of mass destruction, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison.

The charges have been ramped up from those brought against him in August, in an effort to increase his prison sentence.

The federal grand jury has also charged him with attempted murder of officers or 
employees of the United States, two counts of possession of a firearm 
for use in a federal crime of violence, and two counts of possession of a
destructive device for use in a federal crime of violence.

He will now be tried first on this six-count indictment,
according to the prosecution.

Terrifying plot: Abdo was arrested with bomb-making materials after asking to be discharged from the Army as a conscientious objector

Abdo faced three federal charges in August - possession of an unregistered destructive device, possession of a firearm and possession of ammunition by a fugitive from justice - but the maximum penalty for each was only ten years.

He was approved for discharge from the Army as a conscientious objector at the start of this year, after citing his Muslim beliefs, but that status was put on hold when he was charged with possessing child pornography.

The soldier then went absent without leave from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, in early July, and was arrested later that month at a motel near Fort Hood.Â 

Police were alerted by a local gun shop owner that Abdo had been acting 'suspicious'.

Investigators say they found a handgun, an article titled 'Make a bomb in the kitchen of your Mom' and the ingredients for an explosive device - including gunpowder, shrapnel and pressure cookers - in his room.

An article by that name appears in an al-Qaeda magazine.

Abdo told police after his arrest that he planned to make two bombs and detonate them in a restaurant where Fort Hood soldiers eat, according to documents filed in the case.

At his first court appearance in July, Abdo shouted out the name of a military psychiatrist accused of a 2009 shooting rampage at the base.

He yelled at the media as he left the Waco courtroom: 'Abeer Qassim al-Janabi Iraq 2006; Nidal Hasan, Fort Hood, 2009!'

Hasan is accused of killing 13 people and wounding 32 in the attack.

Abeer Qassim al-Janabi was a 14-year-old girl who was raped and murdered by U.S. soldiers in 2006.

ABC also reported that Abdo had mentioned the name of Anwar al-Awlaki, a powerful al-Qaeda leader, during interrogations.

The network said Abdo had told police he was targeting the base to 'get even,' possibly after his discharge from the army was delayed until after the child porn trial.

He was arrested after a call from Greg Ebert, an employee at a Killeen gun shop, who told Reuters he was concerned when Abdo bought ammunition and smokeless powder.

It was the same gun shop from which Hasan had bought his weapons two years ago.

Last September, Abdo said of his conscientious objector status: 'As a Muslim, we stand against injustice, we stand against discrimination, and I feel it's my duty as an individual to do this.

'I knew that if I went to Afghanistan and, God forbid, something were to happen, that my faith was so weak that I wouldn't be admitted into heaven.'

Abdo, who remains in federal custody, had not yet entered a plea for the original three charges.

Authorities have said there is a gag order in the Texas case.
