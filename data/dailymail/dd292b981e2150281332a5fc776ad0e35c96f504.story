Pippa Middleton has taken an advanced wine course to ensure she is properly equipped to be a roving sommelier - and passed with distinction.

The Duchess of Cambridge's 31-year-old sister has already said she enjoys a glass of wine as part of her healthy living regime but has now shown serious knowledge of it.

The brunette, who is in talks to sign a deal with NBC's Today Show, completed her advanced certificate at the Grape Experience Wine & Spirit School, passing with distinction.

Healthy living: Pippa Middleton shares a tipple with her brother James Middleton - and says an occasional glass of wine is part of her healthy living regime 

Hobby: Pippa says she enjoys a drink in moderation. Her distinction in her wine exam was praised by one of London's top sommeliers.

The grade is a sign that she has a serious interest in - and knowledge of - wine.

The exam is not for the uncommitted, as it covers knowledge of grape growth, harvesting, wine-making and labelling and other drinks as well.

Emily O'Hare, head sommelier of the River Cafe in London, one of the city's top restaurants, said the course showed a serious interest in wine.

'It is a tough course,' O'Hare told MailOnline,

'it is hard to pass as it requires a lot of study and to get Distinction it really means a lot of extra hours.

'There is a tasting paper of two wines examined blind and then a theory paper that tests the student on everything from vine health to the production of spirits.

'It requires great breadth of knowledge, and is a fantastic course.'

Last month, Pippa revealed her secrets to her remarkably toned figure in her Mind & Body column in Waitrose Food Monthly, published by the British supermarket chain.

It included 30-minute work outs at home, shunning diets, and enjoying food in moderation - and particularly a glass of wine.

Writing in Waitrose magazine, Pippa said: 'I grew up with the belief that good health is about moderation in all things, so I'll be celebrating healthy living through exercise, a balanced diet and a little of the naughty stuff sprinkled in - I'm talking chocolate, crisps and the occasional glass of wine. 

'I've never done Dukan, attempted Atkins or exercised religiously seven days a week, but I do believe in making healthy choices - keeping refined carbs such as white bread and pasta to a minimum, and sticking to sensible portion sizes.' 

Pippa is currently in negotiations with NBC about signing up as a correspondent for the Today show.

She was spotted dashing in and out of the Big Apple last week for talks with Today show execs after filming a test segment in Wyoming..

Pippa flew to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where she was spotted at a hoedown dance with locals surrounded by cameras. 

Pippa has been in talks with the 'Peacock Network' for a new job after she was interviewed by Matt Lauer this summer, the Today show presenter, sources at NBC have confirmed to MailOnline.

NBC News previously denied that a deal was in the works but the network has reportedly been in serious talks with Pippa for months about becoming a lifestyle and health correspondent.

Excited locals in Jackson Hole, posted pictures all over social media of Miss Middleton this week, dressed in boots, skinny jeans and wearing a checked shirt. 

Pippa performed a routine which involved some twirling and sashaying with an elderly gent in a cowboy hat before going on to have a drink at the bar.

 Emily hash-tagged one video clip with 'pippamiddleton' before saying that she had told the sister to the future Queen she was happy she visited, and received a gracious smile as a reply.

 Another person at the bar, Wyomingsith, remarked that she was 'moving quickly' and had only stayed for around ten minutes. 

Pippa first piqued NBC's interest in June when her interview, where she chatted over tea about her sister and Prince George, brought in high ratings for the network.

 

It is expected that Ms Middleton, a former party planner and cookbook author who has been writing occasional columns about sports and lifestyle, will continue to focus on these subjects in her new role.

NBC has declined to comment when approached by MailOnline.

During her interview with Matt Lauer in June, which marked Pippa's first-ever TV appearance, the glamorous socialite shed light on her relationship with her sister, who is a member of the British Royal Family through her marriage to Prince William.

4: d - New Zealand Chablis (Chablis is a geographical area, the others are grape varieties)

Miss Middleton famously stole the spotlight during the Royal Wedding in 2011 when she donned a curve-hugging white bridesmaid’s gown for the ceremony.

Pippa's media career has suffered a few minor setbacks this past year.

Her party-planning book, Celebrate, suffered disappointing sales, and in May it was announced that Middleton had been dropped as a columnist for The Daily Telegraph after just six months. 

She still writes for Vanity Fair as well as supermarket Waitrose.

Pippa is currently dating stockbroker Nico Jackson, 36, who in July took a new job at a hedge fund in Switzerland.
