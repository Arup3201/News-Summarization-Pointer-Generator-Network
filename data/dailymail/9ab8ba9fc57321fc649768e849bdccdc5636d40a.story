Real mink eyelash extensions are becoming increasingly popular

The trend for real mink eyelashes is sweeping the UK, according to salon owners.

Crafted from fur brushed off live animals, the lash extensions have been long been popular on the other side of the Atlantic, thanks to the likes of Jennifer Lopez, Kim Kardashian and Heidi Klum.

And now an increasing amount of Brits are snapping up the beauty accessory.

Previously sets of mink lashes could cost up 
to £5,000 but as the craze has become more mainstream customers can have
them applied in 2 hours for just £125.

Janette Vince, of Designer Lashes London,
which offers 100 per cent Siberian mink eyelashes, said that the fur 
lashes have been a hit with women looking for a more natural look.

She
told MailOnline: 'I started offering 100 per cent Siberian mink lashes 
around 12 months ago and now I have a couple of suppliers in the U.S.

'There aren't that many people offering the treatment and I wanted to offer my clients more choice. Mink lashes give the most natural look.'

And she reassured: 'They don't kill the animals, they brush the minks and then collect the fur by hand.'

A range of 100 per cent mink lashes also appear on Eyelashesdirect.co.uk

A palette containing 12 lines of lashes is priced at £9.95, while a boxed set can be purchased for £44.95.

Meanwhile the Away Spa at the W Hotel in London's Leicester Square  has started offering a mink eyelash treatment.

However its London-based eyelash extension artist Ruthie Belle prefers to use synthetic versions.

'Synthetic mink lashes have the look and feel of real fur lashes but they produce a better curl.

'We've just added the eyelash treatment to the menu and it's already proving very popular.'

Earlier this year U.S. star of Jersey Shore,
Snooki, was forced to remove five pairs of real mink eyelashes from her 
website after coming under fire from animal rights group PETA.

It
is thought false eyelashes first became popular in the 1920s when 
Hollywood actresses used them to make their eyes appear bigger.

They were first created using human hair.
