A Michigan driver who opened fire on several cars along a highway believed government agencies were tracking him, a court heard.

Raulie Casteel is contesting terrorism and assault charges after firing 23 times at vehicles on Interstate 96 over several days in October 2012.

The unemployed geologist told jurors that while stuck in traffic he became filled with fear and anxiety, most likely caused by an undiagnosed paranoid thinking disorder.

Paranoid: Raulie Casteel, pictured in court on Monday, says he was suffering from delusions

The 44-year-old told the assistant attorney general that he didn't think about the ramifications of the shooting before picking up the handgun that he kept in the front of his car.

Despite hitting several cars only one person was injured in the attacks.

Casteel said that after losing his job he started to believe his ex-employer was 'blackballing him'.

He believed the company was using ties with the Army to prevent him finding another job, and he believed the government was monitoring his phone calls and sending helicopters over his home.

Casteel said he also believed at the time that 'advanced technologies' used by the government may have played a part in his wife's miscarriage, and caused his young daughter and two cats to get sick.

He told the court he also sensed broadcasters were trying to send him messages while he watched telecasts of Detroit Tigers games.

'Sounds kind of paranoid,' his attorney, Charles Groh, said to Casteel in court.

'It
 was, yes,' he replied, adding: 'It sounds crazy now.'

Mr Groh told the court his client, an experienced hunter, had been 'chasing demons' when he opened fire on the road.

He claimed Casteel wasn't trying to hurt anyone, CBS Detroit reported.

The shootings took place along a 100-mile stretch of road. Casteel was arrested after police matched bullet fragments from cars to his gun.

Only one person was injured in the shooting, but the attack set the region on edge, with schoolchildren being kept in during recess.

Victim Scott Arnold initially thought the explosion he heard was a tire blowout as he drove on I96 in Fowlerville.

When
 he felt pain in his side he pulled over and saw blood and a bullet hole
 in his vehicle. He had been struck in the buttocks.

Fearful: Jennifer Kupiec told the court she saw Casteel laugh after firing at her car

On trial: Raulie Casteel has contested terrorism and assault charges, telling a court at the time of the shootings he was suffering from extreme anxiety that made him believe government agencies were spying on him

The court heard from other drivers left traumatized by the shooting. Many didn't see the shooter, and only realized they had been shot at when they lost control of their vehicles or saw the bullet marks, ABC7 reported.

Jennifer Kupiec told the court a bullet missed her by a millisecond, and that she saw Casteel  laughing when he shot at her car.

'I started to cry hysterically. I could see right away where the bullet was. I know that could have been me,' Ms Kupiec said, as she brushed away tears.

Casteel is contesting terrorism and assault charges, but not firearms charges.

He said after the shooting he 'knew people were scared' and that 'he might get a knock on his door someday'.

The geologist, who worked on environmental clear up operations, told the court there was a history of mental illness in his family.

Since
 his arrest, he has been given mental health counseling and was 
prescribed medication that had helped with the feelings of fear and 
anxiety.

However, prosecutors want the judge to tell jurors that mental illness cannot be used as a defense for the charges.

Treatment: Casteel, right, at a hearing in November 2012 at which he was ordered to undergo competency and criminal responsibility examinations

Last
 year, Casteel pleaded no contest but mentally ill to assault and 
firearms charges in connection to related shootings 
that took place there.

He faces up to 12 years in prison when he is 
sentenced Thursday.

A no contest plea isn't an admission of guilt but is
 treated as such for sentencing purposes. The mental illness plea allows him 
to get treatment in prison.
