Clearly and concisely, victim Brienna Campos, 20, told emergency responders where she was, if she was OK, and how two men broke into her home and killed her friend.

'We didn't see him move, so I'm pretty sure he got a clean shot in the head and he's dead,' Miss Campos told the operator. 'I can only think that they [the shooters] are probably linked to the people that robbed us last time.'

Armed men had only moments before broken into Miss Campos' Ocoee home, pulled the residents from their beds and lined them up for execution one by one.

Miss Campos and her brother Remington Campos, 23, survived the shots to their heads, but their roommate Alex Zaldivar, 19, did not.

Murdered: Alex Zaldivar, 19, was fatally shot in the head by home invaders. At least two men broke into his house on September 10 and lined up him and two friends and shot them, execution style

'Miraculous': Siblings Remington Campos, left, and Brienna Campos, right, were also shot in the head during the home invasion but survived. They stumbled to a neighbour's home for help

The Orlando Sentinel obtained the three-minute long recording after a public information request.

The attack took place the morning of September 10, the day before Miss and Mr Campos were scheduled to testify against Bessman Okafor and Nolan Bernard for a break-in that took place in May.

The victims believe the home invasion was an attempt to execute the residents of the home while so they could not testify.

Miss Campos maintained her composure throughout the call, detailing her miraculous escape.

'I ran out the backdoor to a neighbor's house,' she says. 'Literally, within minutes ago.'

Her neighbor can be heard tending to the girl's wounds, putting a towel on her head to soak up the blood. She told the operator that she was woken up by a loud noise downstairs.

'I'm pretty sure they kicked in the door because I heard a noise [and] the dogs started barking,' she recalled.

'I was sleeping in my undergarments so I got in my closet and put on a pair of shorts and I hear another kick and it's a guy shoving a pistol in my face.'

She added 'I barely got pants on.'

She also described how the two men wore all black, using t-shirts as a mask to conceal their identities.

'We saw them go out the door on foot, but I'm sure they probably had a vehicle somewhere down the road,' Miss Campos said.

'I don't see them sticking around for too long after they had three gunshots go off in my living room.'

As officers sirens draw nearer, one can hear Miss Campos inspecting her wound.

'I can't tell if that's like brain or what... sick,' she said, disgusted with the situation.

After the call, police tracked 27-year-old Bessman Okafor and 26-year-old Nolan Bernard at a home in west Orange County, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

Okafor was out of jail on bond for the burglary and an electronic monitor showed he was not at home during the time of the invasion. Bernard was in the Orange County Jail.

So far, no one has been charged with the home invasion.

 at home during the second break in. Nolan Bernard, right, was also 
charged in May

'They were trying to execute them all because they were going to testify the very next day,' Zaldivar's father, Rafael, told the Orlando Sentinel. 'They came here and executed him like a dog.

The friends' home in Ocoee, Florida was targeted for the second time on September 10 at 5.15 a.m.

Police believe two or three suspects kicked down the locked front door and started pulling the friends from their beds and lining them up in the living room.

Brienna, whose room was nearest the front door, was scrambling to put on clothes when the intruders dragged her out and put her face-down on the floor.

Her brother Remington was pulled from
 his bed, pistol-whipped and pushed next to his sister, he told his 
parents. Alex was then forced alongside them.

Terrifying: Alex, left, had reached over for the hand of Brienna, right, and her brother to tell them he loved them before he was shot dead in his living room. The siblings are now in hiding

Fearing his life was about to end, Alex grabbed the hands of his two friends and told
 them he loved them - before the suspects kicked apart their hands and 
started shooting, the parents said.

Brienna was shot first but remained conscious, sparking one of the men to ask: 'Did you miss?'

She played dead and listened as her brother and friend were shot, her father said.

They fired at Alex multiple times, including at least once in the back of the head. Remington was shot once in the head, but also miraculously survived.

The men left and after Brienna failed
 to find a phone, she stumbled with her brother through the back door 
and over a fence to a neighbour's house, leaving a trail of blood behind
 them.

The
 Campos siblings survived and are now in hiding. They are certain their 
attackers were the also behind the May invasion, but police have not yet
 made any arrests in the latest case.

The two men, Okafor and Nolan Darnell Bernard, were
 scheduled to stand trial on September 11, the day after the shooting, 
and Alex and Brienna were listed as possible witnesses.

One suspect, 27-year-old
 Okafor was out on bond with a tag. He left his home at 4.40 a.m. the 
morning of the shootings and returned at 5:46 a.m., court records 
reveal.

He was arrested for violating the terms of his release but has not been charged in the shootings.

The
 parents of the victims returned to the home on Monday to sweep up their
 children's dry blood and tell their version of events.

'It's a miracle my children survived, ' Alfonso Campos, who owns the home, said.

Alex,
 who was studying business at a nearby community college, was buried in 
Gotha. He leaves behind his parents and big brother, Raf.

Loss: The families said they would fight for justice for Alex, left, who was buried last week, right

Alfonso Compos said his children will now fight to put their friend's killers behind bars.

'They will not be afraid to keep on going and bring justice,' he said.

'We don't want his death to be in vain,'
 Rafael Zaldivar added. 'They executed him like a dog. They were cowards,
 complete cowards.'

Friends and family are now rallying for Alex's voice to be heard, setting up community groups calling for justice and signing petitions to make breaking out on bond harder for suspects.

On a Facebook group, they write that Okafor has a history of violence and crime - 17 criminal charges since he was 16.

'How could [the judge] let such a violent criminal with a record like this go with a soft slap on the wrist?' they write. 'None of this would have happened if Okafor were still in prison where he clearly belongs.'
