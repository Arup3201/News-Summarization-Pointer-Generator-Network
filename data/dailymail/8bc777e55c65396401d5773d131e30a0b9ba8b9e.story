A Jamaican-born lollipop man has been sacked after calling a black council colleague 'King Kong' and 'monkey' during a row.

Jon Seymour, 46, started arguing with the unnamed official after he asked him to lower his voice as he spoke on the phone at Camden Town Hall in London.

He claimed he had been trying to arrange a refund because a parking meter had swallowed Â£4 of his change when the man 'interrupted his conversation'.

Dismissed: Jon Seymour has been sacked after calling a black council colleague 'King Kong' and 'monkey'

Scene: Mr Seymour, 46, started arguing with the unnamed official after he asked him to lower his voice as he spoke on the phone at Camden Town Hall (pictured) in London. He claimed the man had 'interrupted' him

This led to a heated argument, during which Mr Seymour used 'aggressive' language, including the words 'King Kong' and 'monkey', before being escorted from the building by two security officers.

Mr Seymour, who had worked as a lollipop man for 20 years, was instantly dismissed by Camden Council after a disciplinary hearing ruled he had committed gross misconduct.

But despite handing in his pole and uniform, he has insisted he was not being racist and has vowed to appeal against the dismissal.

Mr Seymour, from Kentish Town, North London, said today: 'It was not racial. He was getting all angry so it was like he was acting like he 
was a big strong gorilla, so that's why I called him King Kong.

Job: During his career, Mr Seymour had helped children cross the road outside Carlton Primary School (above) in Kentish Town. But he was instantly dismissed by Camden Council after committing 'gross misconduct'

'My mum is black, I'm black. It is not being racist. It was nothing to do with his colour. No one looks like King Kong.

'I apologised to him and we shook hands after, but Camden wanted to take it further for some reason.'

Following the incident in King's Cross last July, the council arranged an internal disciplinary hearing.

Vow: Despite handing in his pole and uniform, he has insisted he was not being racist and has vowed to appeal against the dismissal

It ruled that that Mr 
Seymour, who had helped children cross the road outside Carlton Primary School in Kentish Town, was in 
breach of the town hall's code of conduct for staff.

An internal report seen by the Evening Standard, said: 'All witnesses confirmed Mr Seymour used the words "King Kong" and "Monkey".'

Louise
 McBride, who chaired the hearing, said: 'I am satisfied, on the basis 
of the information obtained during the investigation, that this 
complaint is upheld on the basis that your behaviour was both physically
 and verbally aggressive and threatening and that you used insulting 
language.'

But Mr Seymour has claimed he will launch an appeal against the decision, saying: 'I'm not going to leave it lying. I want people to know what Camden is about.'

He added: 'I think what they did to me was wrong. I've been there almost 20 years and never had a warning. I haven't had any problems with anyone else.'

If successful, the appeal would see a group of 
councillors set up a panel to look into the case.

Camden
 Council spokesman Steve Shawcross said the row had been a 'potentially 
physical altercation' which had been 'aggressive in nature'.

Mr Seymour's conduct had been filmed on CCTV and this evidence formed part of the disciplinary process, he said.

The
 council said in a statement: 'Camden has a code of conduct which sets 
out how staff are expected to behave towards the public and other 
members of staff.

'We can confirm that a member of staff was dismissed from the council for gross misconduct.

'We are unable to comment further at this stage as the dismissal may be subject to an appeal to elected members.'
