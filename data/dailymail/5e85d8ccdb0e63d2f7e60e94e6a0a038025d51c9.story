Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal has defended his decision to put his faith in youngsters against Swansea City last week - by telling Gary Neville it has always worked for him in the past.

Having endured a 2-1 defeat in his first Premier League match in charge at Old Trafford last weekend with a team containing Jesse Lingard and Tyler Blackett, Van Gaal remains confident he will succeed.

The Dutchman remains undeterred by the result and will continue to utilise the youngsters he has at his disposal in his United squad, just as he has done at Ajax and Bayern Munich previously.

Philosophy: Manchester United manager has insisted he will stick with his ideals and play the youngsters

Questioning: Gary Neville (pictured) interviewed Van Gaal for The Telegraph and asked him about his philosophy

True to form: Van Gaal has always played the youngsters at every single club he has been at in the past

When questioned by Neville for an interview in The Telegraph, Van Gaal responded that his 'philosophy' was to play with kids.

The Dutchman said: 'I actually played with 17-year-old players in a (Champions League) final (for Ajax).

'So don't say to me that youngsters cannot play football. When you are fitting in a philosophy you can do a lot.

'And of course Seedorf was playing at 17 in a final. And Seedorf was a fantastic player. (Patrick) Kluivert was 18 - and he scored a goal (the winner in the final against AC Milan).' 

United and Van Gaal travel to the Stadium of Light to face Sunderland on Sunday in their first Premier League away match of the season.
