The pilot of an F-15 jet that crashed earlier this week in a remote area of Virginia was killed military officials announced on Thursday.

Col. James Keefe announced the news at the Massachusetts Air National Guard in Westfield, Massachusetts, home of the 104th Fighter Wing with which the pilot and jet were based.

Keefe said his thoughts and prayers are with the family of the pilot, whose identity was not disclosed.

This brings to a sad end an exhaustive two-day search involving more than 100 local, state and federal officials as well as volunteers. 

When asked how investigators knew the pilot had died, Brig. Gen. Robert Brooks, Commander of the Massachusetts Air National Guard said rescuers found evidence at the crash site Thursday that the pilot did not eject.

Pressed for specifics, he said, 'We just found evidence that the ejection seat was with the aircraft.'

Brooks would not comment on whether the pilot's remains had been found.

He added that the investigation into what caused the crash of the single-seat jet is ongoing and would take several weeks. 

He also said the pilot's family had been informed and his identity would be made public Friday.

The jet crashed in the mountains of western Virginia on Wednesday morning, shaking residents but causing no injuries on the ground. The impact left a deep crater and a large debris field in a heavily wooded area adjacent to a mountain in the George Washington National Forest.

Authorities said the pilot was headed to New Orleans for radar installation as part of routine maintenance and reported an inflight emergency before losing radio contact.

F-15s are maneuverable tactical fighters that can reach speeds up to 1,875 mph, according to the Air Force website. The F-15C Eagle entered the Air Force inventory in 1979 and costs nearly $30 million, the website says. The Air Force has nearly 250 F-15s.

Several F-15s have crashed over the past few years in various states. Causes included failure of a support structure for the jet and pilot error.
