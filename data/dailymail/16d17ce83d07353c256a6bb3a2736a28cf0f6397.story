Photos captured the dramatic demolition of a interstate truss bridge on Tuesday, in an event that was reportedly witnessed by 'hundreds.'

The explosion aimed at what used to be the Chain of Rocks Canal Bridge over the Mississippi River was actually the second in a three-part series, KPLR reported.

In preparation, a stretch of I-270 crossing from St. Louis, Missouri, to Granite City, Illinois, was closed, according to the affiliate station.

The Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) tweeted  updates on the bridge demolition Tuesday, including numerous photographs of bystanders and photographers that stood near the bridge ahead of the explosion.

'Hundreds of people are gathered here to watch #ChainofRocks #demolition set for 10 a.m.,' the agency tweeted. 

Another of its tweets said 'BOOM! The old #ChainofRocks Canal bridge is now on the water. Successful #demolition.'

However, there will now be a Wednesday explosion because the one on Tuesday failed to go the way it was expected to, KPLR reported. 

Indeed, IDOT later tweeted that 'I-270 will be closed for 2 hours starting at 9:45 a.m. Wed. for an additional detonation of the old Chain of Rocks Canal bridge. #ILtraffic.'

Standing by: Onlookers were seen waiting for the bridge to blow up on Tuesday 

The new Chain of Rocks Canal Bridge's eastbound side suffered minor damage from the Tuesday event, KPLR reported.

According to The Bellesville News-Democrat, part of the bridge failed to plummet into the water.

IDOT project engineer Barry Gibbs told the newspaper that piece measures approximately 40 feet in height and 20 feet across.

Jeff Church, who is also from the state agency, told the newspaper 'Right at the eastern end of what was the span over the river, the last piece did not fully detonate and fall. In the meantime, we want to make sure it’s secured, so they’re securing it to the piece of the structure over land.'

The newspaper reported that Demtech is handling the explosion.

Demtech general manager Albert Godfrey told The Belleville News-Democrat 'We're putting together a plan to bring it down.'
