Boris Johnson has been blasted by road safety campaigners after claiming two-thirds of cyclists killed or seriously injured in London caused the crashes by breaking the laws of the road.

Mr Johnson told his first Mayor's Question Time cyclists were to blame for 62 per cent of serious accident involving bikes - claiming too many riders ignored traffic laws.

The mayor, who described himself as a 'passionate, militant cyclist', faces accusations of hypocrisy, four years after he was caught on video cycling without a helmet along a pavement and through two red lights.

During Question Time this week, the mayor said: 'The increase in cycling has not necessarily been accompanied by an increase (in) observance of the rules of the road.

'It is very important, I think people should be aware of the high proportion. I have seen a figure of I think 62 per cent... of cyclist KSIs (people killed and seriously injured) are associated with some infraction by the cyclist themselves of the rules of the road. That is very sad.'

Kate Cairms, whose sister Eilidh was killed by a lorry in 2009, said Mr Johnson's comments were dangerous and risked pitting cyclists and drivers against each other.

'He has done a lot of harm to cyclists because he has upped the ante between cyclists and drivers when we need to be upping the level of mutual respect,' she toldÂ The Independent.

'It is tarring people with the same brush. There are cyclists who jump red lights so people say they all do. But there are also bad drivers and that doesn't lead us to say everyone is bad.'

Other critics have queried the source of the mayor's figures - pointing to a 2009 report from the independent Transport Research Laboratory which showed that motorists were entirely at fault for between 64 and 70 per cent of accidents involving adults over 25.

A spokesperson for the Mayor of London said: 'When attending a recent Mayoral hustings event the Mayor was told that figures indicated a high proportion of cyclists killed or seriously injured were either committing an offence or in the process of doing so.

'He has asked his team to look into whether that statistic can be confirmed as part of getting the most accurate assessment to tackle the issue successfully.'

In 2008 Mr Johnson was forced to backtrack after the Sunday Mirror caught him on film breaking a number of traffic laws as he rode to work at City Hall.

His spokesman said at the time: 'Boris feels strongly thatcyclists should not jump red lights and if he did so then clearlythat was a mistake and he will be more careful in thefuture.'
