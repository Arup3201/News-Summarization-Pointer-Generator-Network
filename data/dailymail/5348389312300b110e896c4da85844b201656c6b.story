In the animal kingdom appearances can be deceptive and although these smiling eggs may looked friendly, they are in fact very anti-social.

If stepped on these newly-laid eggs give off a foul waft similar to the smell of rotting rubbish.

The stink bugs are native to Asia, but in 
1998 they were accidentally introduced into the U.S. and have since crept 
their way in leaving farmers with millions of dollars worth of damage to
their crops.

Deceptive appearances: They may look friendly, but if you squash one of these beneath your feet they will give off a foul waft similar to the smell of rotting rubbish

Damage: The bugs are native to Asia but in 1998 they were accidentally introduced into the US and have since crept their way in leaving farmers with millions of dollars worth of damage to their crops

They have a varied diet and are known to eat anything from cherries to soy beans using their needle-like mouth to pierce the skin of the fruits.

Russian photographer Michail Gribkov snapped the smiley eggs in Kiev, Ukraine on June 2.

Mr Gribkov is an engineer and physicist by day but has been dabbling in photography for 25 years.

In the past five years, he started 
specialising in macro photography, a specialist form of photography 
allowing extreme close-up images of tiny objects to be caught.

Time for tea: Stink bugs aren't fussy and are known to eat anything from cherries to soy beans using their needle-like mouth to pierce the skin of the fruits

Mr Gribkov, 49, said: 'I've become addicted to this kind of photography in recent years and was on holiday from Moscow when I noticed these in Kiev.

'When I first saw these eggs, they reminded me of the eggs from the Alien movie.

'It was really interesting to photograph them as I've never seen anythingÂ  like them before.

'I found it especially satisfying as it looked like they were smiling back at me. '

'It wasn't until I got home and did some research into the eggs, that I realised they were stink bugs.

'I'm just glad I didn't end up standing on one.'
