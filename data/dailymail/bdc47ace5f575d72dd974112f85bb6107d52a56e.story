The blame game has started since Manchester United’s mauling in Milton Keynes and nobody has been spared.

Louis van Gaal, only a few weeks into his reign at Old Trafford, has been criticised for picking an inexperienced team, playing a system that is alien to his squad —and signing autographs immediately after that 4-0 defeat.

David Moyes, sacked in April, had the spotlight on him. He was at fault, so the arguments went, because he wasn’t brutal enough when he arrived last summer and failed to get rid of the players who were not up to United standard.

Under pressure: Louis van Gaal has endured a rocky start to his reign as Manchester United manager

Shock: United were thrashed 4-0 by MK Dons in their Capital One Cup second-round tie

The players have been blasted. So, too, have the Glazer family and chief executive Ed Woodward. But another figure has been embroiled in the post-mortem. When his name was mentioned, however, I found myself shaking my head in disbelief.

Sir Alex Ferguson.

He should have left a better squad, the theory goes. He left United weak because he did not sign better players and, as a result, his legacy is being damaged because United appear to be in freefall. Van Gaal has claimed he will need a year to turn the situation.

I find it remarkable anyone could genuinely feel Ferguson has anything to do with what is happening now. What we are actually seeing, with each passing week, is how far Ferguson’s genius stretched and just how much of an impact he had on the club.

Blow: Gylfi Sigurdsson scored the winner as Swansea beat United 2-1 at Old Trafford on the opening day

Consider this: on August 28, 2011, United demolished Arsenal 8-2 at Old Trafford. The performance was widely described as being ‘spell-binding’ and ‘ruthless’ and was the product of slick football. They terrorised Arsenal with the speed of their passing and movement.

The team Ferguson selected that day was as follows: David de Gea; Phil Jones, Chris Smalling, Jonny Evans, Patrice Evra: Nani, Tom Cleverley, Anderson: Ashley Young, Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck. Three weeks later, the majority of that team lined up against Chelsea and beat them 3-1.

Makes you think, doesn’t it? Of the XI who tackled Arsenal, all bar Evra started the current campaign at the club. Some, such as Cleverley and Welbeck, could move before the transfer window closes on Monday but three years ago they were being hailed as United’s future.

Held back: Despite Juan Mata's goal, United were held to a 1-1 draw at Sunderland

It has to be said that some of the above named now look distinctly average but Ferguson got the best out of them. He had a unique ability to drive United on to win titles and squeeze every last drop out of his players.

He drummed into them that they were the best and made them believe it.

Ferguson had an aura. It wasn’t just in matches. On a Friday afternoon, you would hear opposition managers talking about what bottle of wine they intended bringing him, sounding beaten before they had turned up at Old Trafford.

We all know he was partial to making comments about referees before big games. And there were times when I saw him waiting in the tunnel for the official. I made it my job to man-mark the referee so Fergie couldn’t bend his ear!

United always had a way of winning under Ferguson, even when they were not at their best.

You had to fight to the last second for every point you took off them and you always knew how dangerous they were to cope with in the dying moments if a game was delicately poised.

Glittering: Sir Alex Ferguson ended his long reign at Old Trafford with the title in 2013

How much was down to him? More than you would think. Last season, they scored seven times between the 81st and 90th minute — the period when they always seemed to get one more chance under Ferguson — but not one goal secured them a point.

In 2012-13, his final campaign, United scored 12 late goals. They were worth nine points.

What United are discovering now is that they are in the real world. Ferguson distorted reality for the Glazers and, in some way, the supporters through his ability to keep getting spectacular results on a consistent basis.

He broke the British transfer record five times before the Glazers came in 2005 but only did it once — for Dimitar Berbatov — after they arrived. Yet between 2007 and 2013, Ferguson led them to the Barclays Premier League five times. The years they missed out (2010 and 2012), they had a chance to win it on the final day.

Misery: David Moyes was sacked after one season in which United missed out on the top four

During a period in which Chelsea’s Roman Abramovich and Manchester City’s Sheik Mansour attempted to exert their financial power, to keep United ahead of the game without spending like their rivals was remarkable. At the start of this season, I said things would never be the same again for Manchester United and the £237.1million they have spent since Ferguson has gone into retirement is not going to recreate the success his teams enjoyed for over 20 years.

It was only down to Ferguson that the Glazers never had to spend like this before.

One thing that is beyond doubt is that Manchester United — and football in general — are unlikely to see another like him.

That’s why I find it startling that his name was included in the recriminations that followed United’s Capital One Cup capitulation.

The only mistake Ferguson has made is underestimating just how good he actually was.

Milan move is best option for Torres

So Fernando Torres’s time in English football is over and I am glad he is heading to AC Milan.

I have said in these pages before that I don’t like to see players who are on big contracts sitting on the bench and hopefully a move to the San Siro will revive his confidence.

When Torres joined us at Liverpool in 2007, he was in the top four strikers in world football. Big, strong and quick, he used to leave defenders trailing and his goal return was magnificent. 

The end: Fernando Torres is heading to AC Milan on a two-year loan deal from Chelsea

Jumping for joy: Torres in training with Chelsea at their base in Cobham

Machine: The Spaniard earned a reputation as one of Europe's best strikers during his time at Liverpool

Clash: Jamie Carragher was impressed by the character displayed by the Spanish striker

It was a joy to be on the same team as him during that period and what really impressed me about him was his character.

He would stand up to defenders and was never someone who could be bullied out of a game. He could give as good as he got.

The Torres who joined Chelsea in January 2011, though, was not the same forward who arrived from Atletico Madrid and we had seen the deterioration in him over his final 18 months at Anfield. 

Appearances: 142

Goals: 81

Goals per game ratio: 1.8 matches

Cost per goal (signed for £24m): £296,000

Appearances: 172

Goals: 45

Goals per game ratio: 3.8 matches

Cost per goal (signed for £50m): £1.1m

Lethal: Torres scored 81 goals in 142 games during his three and a half years at Liverpool

Strike: Torres holds off Rio Ferdinand to score in a 2-0 win over Manchester United at Anfield in 2009

Dry: The Spaniard only managed 45 goals for Chelsea after a £50m move to Stamford Bridge

Slowing down: Torres' pace was one of his biggest assets during his time at Liverpool

He suffered some knee and hamstring injuries and when explosive players like him are hindered by such problems, it is difficult to recapture the spark. So much of Fernando’s game was based on his pace and he found himself unable to race away from defenders as he used to. 

People wondered why he couldn’t do for Chelsea what he had initially done for Liverpool but we were never surprised. If anything, we were pleased with the £50million transfer fee we received for him, even if we didn’t reinvest it properly.

Torres might not have scaled the heights that were expected of him in London but he still leaves with a collection of some of the game’s biggest medals. It will be interesting to see if a switch to Italy revives his goalscoring talent.

This week I'm looking forward to seeing...

How Jack Colback and Fabian Delph fare after being called into the England squad.

While not many would have expected to see Roy Hodgson include their names in his party for the games against Norway and Switzerland, England’s manager will not have selected them on a whim.

Both players will find this weekend that they are judged differently, as the moment you are selected for England you find your games scrutinised like never before. It is important they handle all the extra attention.

Call up: Fabian Delph (left) and Jack Colback (right) have been named in Roy Hodgson's England squad

Colback clearly has no issues over dealing with the mental side of the game. He made a big decision in moving from Sunderland to neighbours Newcastle United but he has settled in quickly on Tyneside and uses the ball well.

As for Delph, he should not be regarded as a surprise inclusion.

He is someone who was talked about as having England potential 10 months ago and might have had a chance by now were it not for injury.

He has been Aston Villa’s best player and both will be desperate to win their first caps at some point in the friendly against Norway. Before then, though, it will be interesting to see how Colback does against Crystal Palace and Delph gets on against Hull.
