Feeling unhappy in your marriage, men? Stop being selfish and focus on your wife's happiness then, dictates new research.

Researchers have found that the key to marital bliss is all about women's feelings and the happier they are, the better.

The study revealed that the more content the wife is within the marriage, the happier the husband is with his life as a result.

Speaking about her research, Dr Deborah Carr of Rutgers University in the US, said: 'I think it comes down to the fact that when a wife is satisfied with the marriage she tends to do a lot more for her husband, which has a positive effect on his life.

'Men tend to be less vocal about their relationships and their level of marital unhappiness might not be translated to their wives.' 

Her research, she says, is extensive and important because both men and women's feelings and how they affect others were taken into account.

'For both spouses, being in a better-rated marriage was linked to greater life satisfaction and happiness.'

The study also found that wives take the role of the carer if their husband becomes unwell, which, in turn, lowers their mood.

Men's happiness levels, however, didn't change if their wife fell sick and left the role of carer to the daughter. 

Researchers said the study, published in the Journal of Marriage and Family, is particularly important because health and wellbeing can be impacted by marriage quality.
