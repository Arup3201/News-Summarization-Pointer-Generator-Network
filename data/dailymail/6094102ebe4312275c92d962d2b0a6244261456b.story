David Cameron and other Cabinet ministers have held private dinners for 45 businessmen and hedge fund bosses, the Conservatives have disclosed.

The rich supporters, who included only two women, were hosted by senior politicians in the last three months of 2014.

According to the party’s latest transparency data, the dinners were held for members of the Prime Minister’s ‘leaders group’ who have collectively given more than £40 million since 2010.

Overall, donors who belong to the club have targeted about £5 million at local constituency associations, of which more than 70 are marginals. 

In exchange for donating £50,000 or more each, the donors get access to the Prime Minister and his cabinet at private dinners.

Jon Ashworth, Labour’s shadow Cabinet Office minister, said the filing showed the Conservatives had become ‘the political wing of the hedge fund industry’.

‘An elite few are helping the Tories try to buy the election. These are the same millionaires and hedge funds who the Tories have given a tax cut to,’ he said.

The revelation comes just a week after it emerged that, at a ‘black and white ball’ in Mayfair, guests bid for the chance to go shoe shopping with Home Secretary Theresa May, and go jogging with Nicky Morgan, the Education Secretary.

The most elite group of donors are instead invited to regular, more intimate meals with Cameron and key ministers where they can discuss politics and policy.

The latest filing shows ministers entertained 45 donors – all but two of whom are male – in the last quarter of 2014. Cameron also hosted one hedge fund boss, Sir Michael Hintze, and his wife at Chequers in October.

An analysis by Labour found more than 40 per cent of the money donated by the leaders group came from the hedge fund industry, which was given a £145 million tax break by George Osborne in 2013.

One of those to attend was Georg von Opel, a Swiss national. The donor’s office said previously: ‘Mr von Opel … is a Swiss national and a Swiss resident since 1973.’

Other wealthy donors who attended the dinners include Michael Spencer, the founder of City inter-dealer broker Icap, Howard Shore, founder and largest shareholder in small company brokers Shore Capital, and Lord Farmer, the metals trading tycoon and Conservative party treasurer.

Another is Alexander Temerko, a director of Offshore Group Newcastle, who told the Newcastle Journal in November: ‘The Conservative party today helps business and construction business, not so effectively as me and my colleagues expected but it is still true.

‘They spend time and they listen to us, they change the law and they change the regulation, and the regulation today is simpler and much more effective and today there is real partnership between business and government.’

It comes as separate claims emerged last night about another industry which was routinely avoiding paying income tax on earnings.

Multi-millionaire chiefs of private equity firms pay are paying less tax than teachers and nurses due to a little-known loophole, a report claimed last night.

Some of Britain’s richest City bosses pay little as 28 per cent tax on their earnings because of a so-called ‘sweetheart deal’ which allows them to pay capital gains tax instead of income tax.

This is huge saving for managers who would otherwise have to pay 40 per cent tax on income over £41,865 and 45 per cent on earnings over £150,000.

A study by Campaign group 38 Degrees claimed the ‘Mayfair loophole’ is costing the Treasury up to £700 million a year in lost income tax and National Insurance contributions.

Fund managers are able to pay capital gains tax – which is levied on profit from the sale of an investment – because they claim their earnings are returns from investments, rather than a guaranteed salary.

Private equity firms raise money from investors and use it to purchase companies, often selling the company on for a substantial profit a few years later.

But 38 Degrees is now calling on Chancellor George Osborne to announce the closure of the loophole in his March Budget.

They said the Government's 2015 Finance Bill allowed the long-standing loophole to continue, despite containing other anti-avoidance measures.

More than one in six of Conservative donors who have attended David Cameron's 'donor dinners' in 2014 were private equity bosses, the group claimed.

David Babbs, of 38 Degrees, said: ‘This Mayfair tax loophole is government-sponsored tax avoidance on a breathtaking scale.

‘Money which should be funding the NHS is going to millionaire fund managers instead.

‘The rest of us pay in our fair share to keep the country going – why should millionaire financiers be treated differently?

‘In his last Budget before the election, George Osborne wants to convince the country that he's on the side of hardworking families on average incomes. If he wants us to take him seriously, he's got to close the Mayfair tax loophole.’

The group claimed that, under Labour in 2003, the private equity industry successfully lobbied to have a special guarantee issued by HMRC that its tax affairs ‘will not be challenged’.

Twelve years ago, HMRC signed a ‘Memorandum of Understanding’ with the BVCA, which represents private equity firms, apparently clarifying that as long as a private equity firm ‘structures itself and its remuneration in a particular way’, their income could be treated as capital gains.

HMRC denied that this was a ‘special arrangement’.

In 2007, Nicholas Ferguson, former chairman of leading private equity firm SVG Capital, said ‘any commonsense person would say that a highly-paid private equity executive paying less tax than a cleaning lady or other low-paid workers can't be right’.

Labour pledged to look again at the loophole, but this has remained in place under the Coalition.

A Treasury source said last night the treatment of private equity profits was ‘agreed by the previous Labour government’.

They said: ‘We raised the rate of Capital Gains Tax from 18 per cent to 28 per cent so this government has actually increased tax on private equity.

‘It was outrageous that under Labour cleaners paid a higher rate tax than the people who employed them.’
