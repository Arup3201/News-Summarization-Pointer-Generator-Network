Olympic hurdler-turned-bobsledder Lolo Jones has revealed she eats four McDonald's double bacon cheeseburgers every day as well as calorie-laden protein shakes, chocolate bars and ice-cream, all in the name of her sport.

The 31-year-old weighs more than ever before - 157 pounds - thanks to a 9,000-calorie-a-day diet that is helping her pile on the weight. The star weighed just 130 pounds when she competed in the 100 meter hurdles at the London Olympics, and the mantra on the track is 'fat doesn't fly.'

But she is now training hard to qualify for the Sochi Games for bobsledding, and in that sport the popular thinking is 'mass pushes mass,' she said.

Happy: Jones said she was pumped about the weight gain because it is all muscle

'I'm the heaviest ever in my life,' Jones told USA TODAY Sports.

She said her very un-Olympic daily diet includes two protein shakes - which, at 1,365 each, are more than the total recommended daily intake for some people - plus not one but four McDonald's double bacon cheeseburgers.

She admitted the change in diet was stark. In track, 'you eat an M&M and you think your career is over,' Jones said.

But the ultra fit woman isn't stopping her junk food binge just yet.

'It took so much work. I'm three 
pounds away from my ultimate goal,' she said.

The extra muscle mass, 
which saw her literally burst the seams of her speed suit at a recent 
commercial photo shoot, will help her power a 400-pound bobsled.

'I'm pumped about this muscle weight,' Jones told USA TODAY. 'My abs are still there. I'm still cut, just super solid.'

In a February interview, after Olympic bobsledder Elana Meyers suggested Jones give the sport a try to pick herself up from the disappointment of coming fourth in the hurdle finals in London, the athlete revealed she was scoffing ice cream, pizza and chocolate to put on weight.

'In the track world, I would eat two carrots and be worried about risking a 12-second race,' Jones said. 'Now they're buying me these huge mocha bars.'

She's serious about the sport, and if her bobsled debut year proved anything she's likely to help Team U.S. score a medal when the Olympics roll around.

Jones and driver Jazmine Fenlator paired to win a silver medal at the World Cup season-opener in Lake Placid, New York.

Team trials for the Sochi Games begin October 12 in Lake Placid and the Olympics kick off in 130 days.

Then the diet begins. Contrary to what many assumed, Jones is not quitting track now she's set her sights on bobsledding and plans to compete in the 2016 summer games in Rio de Janeiro - back at her pre-bacon double cheeseburger weight.
