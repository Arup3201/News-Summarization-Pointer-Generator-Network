At first glance, this slide looks like a fun playground toy for children.

But anyone who tried it out would get a nasty shock - when they plummeted 40ft down the side of the building.

The slide has horrified locals in eastern China who are concerned that kids might reach the roof where it is located.

Watch out below: This slide is located on top of a three-storey building and leads straight off the side

The frame is placed on top of a three-storey factory in Heze, Shandong province, where the slides are manufactured.

It is located so that the end of the slide leads straight off the building, so that any foolish thrill-seeker would drop directly onto a concrete car park.

Neighbours have voiced fears that the colourful object could prove irrestible to teenagers.

'We worry that our children might get in there at weekends and try to play on it,' one said. 'You'd have to be mad to put a slide there.'

Tempting? Locals are concerned that children could climb up to the roof and use the slide

Factory managers say the slide is meant to advertise the company's wares, and is not intended to be used by anyone.

However, following the local outcry, they have agreed to take the object away.

'We can understand people's fears so we will be removing the slide,' a spokesman said.

This is not the first time that Chinese authorities have been blasted for showing an apparently lax regard for public safety.

Earlier this month, a five-year-old boy was left bruised and bloodied when he was propelled into the air by excessively powerful water jets at a public fountain in Hubei province.

Sometimes it is members of the public themselves who court danger - in February, two tourists at a national park were pictured riding on top of a cable car.
