A ship carrying the bodies of Chinese gold miners from New Zealand that sank more than 100 years ago has been found.

S.S. Ventnor was discovered near Whangarei, off the northern coast of New Zealand, in 2012 and renewed hopes that the 499 bodies of Chinese miners on-board would be returned home to their families.

The ship was on its way back to China so the bodies could be buried back home in line with tradition, the New Zealand Herald reported.

Unfortunately, it hit a reef just two days into its journey from Wellington in 1902.

The Chinese miners had been in New Zealand to see if they could get rich during the country's gold rush during the 1860s, which happened in areas such as Otago and the West Coast on the South Island.

The find has also raised controversy among New Zealand's Chinese community who have accused the documentary crew who searched for the wreckage of disrespecting the remains of the dead.

In photographs, schools of fish are seen swimming around the mast of the ship.

To verify it was the S.S. Ventnor, documentary maker John Albert and his team recovered some artefacts from the wreckage.

It was found about 20 kilometres west of Hokianga Harbour, in the North Island, in waters 150 metres deep.

But the New Zealand Chinese Association say the community is 'outraged' the ship did not remained untouched, the New Zealand Herald reported.

The association's Kirsten Wong said there was 'genuine dismay' in the early settler community because of the lack of respect for the 499 people's remains.

'The community is also distressed about suggestions that historic artefacts be shipped to China, when they say the artefacts are not only significant for them, but are an important part of all New Zealanders' social and cultural heritage,' she said.

But a relative of one of the miners told 3News he was 'excited' to finally have answers.

Choie Sew Hoy was 64 years old when he died a year before the ship made its final voyage.

Choie's great-great-grandson said he was looking forward to fulfilling his father's dream of honouring his relative.

'It's important for the Chinese custom that your family tend to your ancestors' graves to ensure a good after life for them, but also the ancestors will look after the living descendants,' he said.
