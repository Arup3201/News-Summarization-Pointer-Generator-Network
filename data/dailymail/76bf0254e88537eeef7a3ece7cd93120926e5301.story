A Cambridge University rower whose leg was smashed in a car crash has hit out at the reckless driver who has shattered her hopes of rowing for Great Britain.

Chiara Ferrara, 27, who competed in the Oxford and Cambridge annual women’s boat race, was left with broken tibia and fibula bones in her leg after a car crashed into the side of her bike as she cycled in Ely, Cambridgeshire, in May.

The King's College graduate, from Histon, Cambs, was told by doctors that she would never be able to run again.

It forced her to lose her training place with the Start programme, an initiative set up to find stars of future Olympics. It's alumni include Olympic gold-winning pair Helen Glover and Heather Stanning.

Driver Stephen Bocking, 47, from Ely, Cambs, who hit Ms Ferrara, pleaded guilty to one count of driving without due care and attention.

He was given a six-point penalty and made to pay a £300 fine and court costs at Cambridge Magistrates' Court on October 3.

The maximum penalty for careless driving is a £2,500 fine, a mandatory three to nine points on the licence and there is the option of a driving ban.

Ms Ferrara, who studied Chinese, slammed the soft sentence and warned of the 'soul-destroying' impact even minor accidents can have.

She said: 'When you have been training 12 times a week as well as working full-time it is soul-destroying when someone takes it all away from you with a moments loss of concentration.

'At the age of 27 I was at that point when I had to decide whether to really go for it with rowing. My goal was to make the national team.

'I never really got my chance and it was not my fault, which is really difficult to deal with. It is heartbreaking.

'Last weekend was the first set of trials. But now I can’t jump, I can’t run I can’t do anything. It would take me a long time to get back to the fitness level I had.

'A consultant told me I might never be able to run again. But I am determined to prove them wrong.'

Ms Ferrara, who works in alumni relations for Cambridge University, added: 'I do not think it is about punishing for the sake of punishing, but I do not think the sentences for driving offences reflect the impact they have on peoples’ lives.

'His attitude at the scene was so unremorseful. It seemed like a minor inconvenience to his day - but for me it was a life-changing injury.

'He doesn’t have to retake his his driving licence. He can get straight back into his car while I have to live with this for the rest of my life.

'I want to make sure he drives really, really carefully from now on and he tells everyone he meets that they should be really careful behind the wheel too.

'People need to have more appreciation that they are operating what is essentially a speeding lump of metal, which can kill.

'The majority of road users are careful and attentive, but for the few that don’t feel it’s their responsibility to be careful there should be much better education programmes and training.

'The current justice system doesn’t seem to allow for that.'
