Shackled: Philip Chism, 15, from Danvers, Masschusetts., enters the courtroom with his attorney Denise Regan before his arraignment on a second rape charge in Salem Superior Court on Thursday

The Massachusetts teenager who allegedly slashed his math teacher to death and then went to catch a movie and a burger pleaded not guilty today to a second aggravated rape charge.

Attorney's for Philip Chism, 15, entered the plea on his behalf as he stood silently with his head bowed and feet shackled during a brief hearing in Essex Superior Court.

Around two dozen people attended the hearing, including members of 24-year-old Danvers High School teacher Colleen Ritzer,  who left without commenting.

Ritzer was found dead in the woods near the school in October. Her throat was slit and a note reading, 'I hate you all' was found at the scene.

Chism, who had been asked to stay late by Ritzer to help after school, allegedly followed her into a bathroom shortly before 3 pm on October 22 and attacked her, sexually assaulted her twice, stripped her and then stole her cellphone, credit cars and her driver's licenses.

According to investigators her body was then placed in a recycling bin and carted away to a wooded area behind the school and dumped.

During the violent assault on Ritzer, Chismm, who was then aged, 14, allegedly raped her twice, one of the assaults was committed with a stick.

He had previously pleaded not guilty to charges of rape, robbery and murder.

In court documents released last week, state police said Chism confessed to killing Ritzer, but denied sexually assaulting her.

According to the documents, Chism made the statements while being interviewed at the Danvers Police Station, after waiving his Miranda rights.

The first rape charge accused Chism of sexually assaulting Ritzer with a stick. The second charge, filed last week, alleges he forcibly had sexual intercourse with her.

Court documents released in November describe surveillance video showing Chism following Ritzer into a school bathroom with gloves and a hood.

Footage also shows Chism carrying a recycling bin into the bathroom then dragging it out behind the building. The recycling bin was found near Ritzer's body, police said.

A hard drive of the school's surveillance footage was submitted as evidence before the court hearing Thursday.

Attorneys also discussed whether Chism will be charged as a juvenile or adult offender on the new rape count. A decision is expected by early March.

However, despite all the evidence against the teenager, the Freshman soccer star refuses to tell anyone why he did it.

Detectives are working on a theory that Chism â€“ who only moved to Danvers from Clarksville, Tennessee at the start of the school year â€“ was 'infatuated' with Colleen, 24 and snapped when she spurned his advances.

But they cannot find any proof.

The Essex County District Attorney's office have told the MailOnline they do not have any idea why Chism allegedly did what he did. They also said that, while they are trying to uncover a motive, it is not their primary focus as they do not need one to secure a conviction. 

A spokeswoman said: 'The motive is part of any investigation, but ultimately we don't have to prove a motive.

When you are piecing together any investigation, you are looking for an explanation, but I wouldn't want characterize where we are with that at this stage. Honestly, who knows why anyone would do something like this.'

Another police source previously described Chism as 'stone cold' on the night of the killing and said that while he confessed to the crime, he would not give any indication why he did it.

Friends and family of Chism are equally mystified by the crime. His mother Diana - who is separated from his father Stacey - said her son was, 'born in love' and that she is, 'struggling to understand' the murder.

Detectives are also  trying to retrieve data from Philip Chism's Samsung smartphone, which they found badly mangled in the woods outside Danvers High School - near the body of teacher Colleen Ritzer.

'It is not unusual for individuals involved in homicides, particularly sexually violent homicides, to memorialize their victimsâ€™ deaths through photographic, audio and or video media for further humiliation of the victim or later viewing, for guilt relief or enjoyment,' Massachusetts state police detective Steven J. Buccheri wrote in newly-released documents, according to the Boston Herald.

Police found Chism's cell phone and Ritzer's iPhone both crushed in the woods. They believe he destroyed both phones in an effort to conceal what he had done.

Officers say they also believe Chism returning to the school - barefoot - and changed out of his bloody clothes and into his soccer uniform.

He then dumped his soiled school clothes, walked around the school soccer fields, and went to see the Woody Allen movie 'Blue Jasmine' at a nearby theater.

When police stopped him on a roadside and arrested him hours later, he had Ritzer's underwear in his pocket - along with a bloody boxcutter, according to police.

In November a grand jury charged him with a second count of aggravated rape and revealed he had raped her before murdering her and and dumping her body with a large tree branch sticking from her genitals.

Prosecutors believe Philip Chism forced Colleen Ritzer to have sex with him after dragging her into a teachers' bathroom at Danvers High School, where she was a teacher and he was a student.

Chism already faced one aggravated rape charge for allegedly sexually assaulting Ritzer with a large stick. Her body was found on her back in a 'sexual position' with the three-foot branch inside her on October 22.

Prosecutors said a psychological exam revealed that the teen is mentally competent to stand trial

Prosecutors revealed that psychologists who evaluated Chism have concluded that he is mentally competent to stand trial, the Boston Globe reports.

However, his lawyers said they may raise issues about his mental health, if they deem it relevant to the legal proceedings.
