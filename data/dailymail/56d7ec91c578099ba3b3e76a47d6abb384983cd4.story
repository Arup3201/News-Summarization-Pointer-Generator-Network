Kris Humphries could agree to settle his divorce case with Kim Kardashian in the next 24 hours.

Both must appear in court tomorrow for a settlement conference and although Kris wants an annulment, TMZ are reporting he could be forced to accept a straight divorce as per Kim's preference.

They list factors which may push him towards compromise, including the fact that there's an ironclad prenup, meaning that if the case goes to trial he'll get no money from Kim.  

Could this all be over? It's being reported that Kim Kardashian could face compromise from Kris Humphries during settlement talks on Friday

He's also faced with monetary 
sanctions for not turning up at the last hearing, and therefore has 
already got the judge offside, plus if he loses, he will have to pay
costs that could amount to around a million dollars in divorce fees.

Plus, there's been no evidence of fraud so far, and according to TMZ: 'Kris is opening his eyes a little bit, and what he sees doesn't look good.'

Meanwhile, it's being reported that 
Kris felt his marriage to Kim was over straight after the honeymoon on 
the Amalfi coast that she never wanted to take.

'Kim felt the marriage was over almost as soon as it began,' a source close to the Brooklyn Nets forward told the website.

'Kris wanted to begin moving his belongings into her house, and Kim absolutely flipped out,' the mole added.

'Kim insisted there was no rush to move his stuff from Minnesota. Her actions really took a toll on their marriage.'

A source claimed that Kris was the one who persuaded his estranged wife to take the honeymoon trip to the Amalfi Coast in Italy.

‘Kris was the one to push for the 
honeymoon. Kim didn’t want to go on the honeymoon because they were 
scheduled to move to New York City to begin filming Kourtney & Kim 
Take New York,’ a source told Radar Online.

‘Kim finally relented. Kris was absolutely dumbfounded when a photographer appeared out of nowhere and started taking pics of them by the pool,’ the source said. ‘Kim happily posed, and Kris realised her camp had arranged it.’

At her divorce deposition Kim confessed that she was against going on the holiday, which Kris is allegedly using as part of his case against the 32-year-old reality star, claiming their marriage was fraud.
