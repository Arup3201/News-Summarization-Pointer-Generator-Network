Taking inspiration direct from her garden talented graphic designer Tang Chiew Ling uses leaves to create imaginative fashion figures.

The 24-year-old from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, says that the key to her work is making 'simple and fun' art that she can conjour up out of everyday objects.

The result is an offbeat but elegant set of mixed media drawings.

Elegant: Audrey Hepburn dressed in three strategically placed leaves by graphic designer Tang Chiew Ling

Chic: Withered leaves get a new lease of life as 50 of them are arranged to make a ballgown and fascinator

Natural: The works are delicately constructed based on the form of the leaves and how Tang Chiew Ling can piece them together

The Fashion in Leaves drawings are only her second personal project, but they cleverly use the shape and colour of the leaves to create variation.

Her collages even use withered leaves to great effect, making ballgowns and evening dresses out of decaying brown leaves.

She said that she found some of them in the garden and rescued others from a drain near her house.

One particularly recognisable model in her work is Audrey Hepburn, whose look she managed to recreate using only three leaves.

Living dress: The decay of the leaves give this outfit an attractive range of brown and green shades

Model figure: Just using two long leaves, she has created a distinct fashion look

Autumnal: The withering state of some designs shows cleverly provides a variety of dresses and give a sense of growth and decay
