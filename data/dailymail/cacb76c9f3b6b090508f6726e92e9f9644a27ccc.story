A mother who survived for 45 minutes without a pulse after giving birth has revealed that during that time she saw a vision of her father surrounded by light.

Doctors at the Boca Raton Regional Hospital in Florida, were just about to pronounce Ruby Graupera-Cassimiro, 40, dead on September 23 when her heart restarted for no clear reason.

Graupera-Cassimiro, who has now completely recovered, has revealed that during the 45 minutes, she felt herself floating along a tunnel.

'I remember seeing a spiritual being who I believe was my dad,' she told ABC News. 'I remember the light behind him and many other spiritual beings.'

'Picture of health': Ruby Graupera-Cassimiro is pictured with her daughter Taily at the Boca Raton Regional Hospital, where she mysteriously awoke after having no heart beat for 45 minutes after the birth

But then a 'force' stopped her and she said she knew she couldn't continue.

Even though doctors had not touched her in several minutes, her heart started beating again - and miraculously, she had no brain damage or broken ribs from where doctors had performed CPR. 

Graupera-Cassimiro, who already has a son, had gone to the hospital for a cesarean section and after giving birth to a healthy baby girl, Taily, she started to experience a shortness of breath.

She remembers being wheeled into the recovery room and then felt like she'd fallen asleep.

Doctors now think amniotic fluid from her womb got into her bloodstream and had stopped her heart beating - which is usually fatal.

Vision: She said that while she was unconscious she saw her late father, pictured left holding her first child, surrounded by light. Her husband, pictured with her before the birth right, told her she had looked dead

She passed out for three hours while medics fought to bring her back.

Medical workers used shock paddles and chest compressions throughout the emergency to try to restore heart beat and circulation while she was unconscious.  

But with no sign of life, they called her family into the operation room to declare her death.

'I was dead,' she said. 'My husband tells me, "You were gray. You were cold as ice, and you were dead. You had no color in your lips".'

She told ABC News that the experience has taught her not to fear death because we 'don't really have control of our lives', she said.  

She is now at home and caring for her child. Last week she returned to the hospital to thank the medics who helped save her.

'Divine providence': Medics at the Boca Raton Regional Hospital in Florida say they don't know why she lived

At the reunion, she said: 'I don't know why I was given this opportunity - but I'm very grateful for it. God had the right people in the right place', she told the Sun Sentinel.

A hospital spokesman said: 'She essentially spontaneously resuscitated when we were about to call the time of death. Today she is the picture of health.'

Doctors had no immediate explanation for her survival. The spokesman called it 'divine providence.'
