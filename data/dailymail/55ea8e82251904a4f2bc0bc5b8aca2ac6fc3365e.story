If you’re one of those air travellers whose blood pressure rises at the sight of a 100-yard snaking check-in queue, there’s some good news.

Airline passengers are being offered meet and greet ‘minders’ to fast-track them from the pavement of the terminal building to the boarding gate of the plane.

Such convenience, however, doesn’t come cheap – in this case it will cost £50 a time. Travellers can pay £40 for the same service on arrivals, making £90 per round-trip.

Manchester Airport is to start charging £50 to help passengers find their way from arrivals to boarding

The VIP service has been introduced this week at Manchester Airport.

It means passengers who pay for the 
privilege of a VIP queue-jump will be whisked hassle-free by their guide
 from the terminal entrance to check-in their bags and then whizz 
through security.

Officials say the scheme is aimed 
mainly at families with children, elderly travellers and passengers with
 little experience of airports and will make their journey more 
‘relaxed’ and ‘stress free’.

For a £50 fee, passengers who drive or
 take a taxi to the airport will be greeted at the kerbside drop-off 
point while those who take the train will be collected from the station 
before being taken to check-in and through the passport check and 
security to boarding.

'Friendly Guides' will be introduced at Manchester Airport to escort passengers around the building

For an additional £40 fee, those 
arriving back at Manchester will be met at the gate, fast-tracked 
through immigration and taken to their baggage carousel.

They will then be escorted to their next means of transport - whether to the station or to their car.

The £50 will cover departing groups of up to four, though individuals travelling alone would still pay the full amount.

For those flying into the airport the service will cost £40 for up to four passengers.

An additional two passengers can be accommodated at an extra cost of £5 per person.

Manchester bosses said the uniformed 
guides will be existing members of staff who are cleared to go ‘airside’
 back and forth through security channels.

They denied profiteering and pointed 
out that a similar ‘concierge’ service offered at Heathrow – and 
operated for the London airport by approved-contractor DiamondAir – 
costs £120.

Manchester, along with many airports, 
already allows passengers to queue-jump security by paying £3.50 for a 
‘fast-track’ pass. Passengers who pay £50 for a ‘Friendly Guide’ will 
get this facility at no extra cost.

Trolleys, which usually cost £1, will 
be provided free of charge although passengers will have to carry their 
own bags and push the trolleys themselves for insurance reasons.

Those in wheelchairs or with disabilities will still be provided with free help.

Tricia Williams, customer service 
director for Manchester Airport, said: ‘The purpose of this service is 
to take the stress out of travelling.

'The Friendly Guide will be your 
dedicated guide to meet you at your point of arrival, whether that be at
 a car park, bus stop, taxi drop-off or the train station and take you 
to your check-in desk before fast-tracking you through security.’
