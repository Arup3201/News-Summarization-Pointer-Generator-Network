Wearing a battered denim jacket and with her long hair unbrushed, Cressida Bonas cut a glum figure as she walked through London's West End this morning.

Pictured for the first time since news of her split from Prince Harry, her boyfriend of two years, was confirmed, the 25-year-old kept her head down as she bought a takeaway fruit drink.

The dancer, who is currently working for a marketing company in Soho after graduating from dance school, is now said to want to concentrate on her career.

The end of her relationship with the Prince, who will be 30 in September, came after rumours that it has become strained in recent weeks.

US magazine People claimed that Miss Bonas had become 'too needy' for the royal, but friends of the couple denied that, saying it was 'very much an amicable' split and that the couple had parted as friends.

A friend of theirs told the Mail: 'Cressida has decided she wants to focus on her career and Harry is really keen that she is allowed to get on with her life.

‘He is furious at this suggestion that the split was in any way because she was relying too much on him. Cressida is one of the most independent people he knows.’

Miss Bonas graduated from the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in Greenwich, and is now said to be working out which career path to follow.

Wearing a black dress, black tights despite the heat, and a hoodie under her denim jacket, she looked lost in her thoughts this morning.

Another friend said that the couple's split might turn out to be temporary, as happened with Kate  Middleton and Prince William before they got engaged.

The friend said: 'Cressie is only 25 and pretty young for her age at that. Prince Harry will be 30 this year and is at a different stage in his life.

'He is incredibly fond of Cressie, and understands that she wants to do something with her life and with her career before she considers settling down.

‘It wouldn’t surprise me in the slightest if they got back together in a few months' time.’

Her ex-boyfriend and Prince William are believed to be heading to Tennessee this weekend to attend the wedding of their close friend, Guy Pelly. 

He is marrying American-born Lizzy Wilson and is said to have asked the princes to be ushers.

Prince Harry and Miss Bonas met in the summer of 2012 after being introduced by Princess Eugenie, and their relationship appeared to have stepped up a gear earlier just a month ago, when they appeared together at a charity engagement in Wembley - the first time Miss Bonas attended an official engagement with the prince.

Royal sources quashed speculation of an imminent engagement after the couple were seen embracing at the event.

But friends of Miss Bonas suggested that her wealthy family had held a summit to discuss the possibility of a royal wedding.

When Prince William and his girlfriend of four years, Kate Middleton, were pictured looking grumpy at the Cheltenham festival in March 2007, it was obvious something was up.

A few days later William, then 25, was pictured at a nightclub near his barracks in Bournemouth in a pose that suggested he was groping a young Brazlian clubber, Ana Ferreira.

The writing was on the wall, and the prince and his university sweetheart took their last outing together at the end of March, to an Oxfordshire pub with their friends, the Van Cutsems.

By the time Kate flew out to Dublin with her mother on 3 April, it was all over.  Devastated, she threw herself into the reason for her visit: attending an exhibition with her mother, followed by a tour of the National Gallery of Ireland.

Her former boyfriend, however, chose to cope differently.  He went out to Mahiki nightclub where fellow revellers said he jumped onto a table, shouted 'I'm free', and then did a Peter Crouch-style robot dance.

News of their split broke the next day.

Determined not to let her heartbreak show, Kate was pictured attending numerous parties, including a roller disco where she was pictured in yellow hotpants.  She was also seen in bunny ears at a DVD launch party.

William soon realised where his heart lay, and in June invited Kate to a party at his barracks.  She spent the night with him, and a month later attended the concert in honour of Princess Diana as William's guest.

Three years later, during which time Kate was dubbed 'Waity Katey', they got engaged, and they married on 29 April 2011.
