Disgraced entertainer Rolf Harris is to be stripped of his CBE 'within days'

Rolf Harris is to be stripped of his CBE in a matter of days after being convicted of child sex offences.

Officials have reviewed whether the 84-year-old disgraced entertainer should have the honour removed following his conviction last year for sexually assaulting girls as young as eight.

The Australian was awarded a CBE in 2006 for his services to entertainment and the arts but formal approval of the revocation of the honour is expected shortly.

The decision by the Honours Forfeiture Committee will be approved by Prime Minister David Cameron and the Queen before being officially published.

Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who wrote an acclaimed book on the Cyril Smith child sex scandal, campaigned for the removal of the CBE.

He said: 'I find it difficult to understand why it has taken this committee so long.

'A number of paedophiles, of which Rolf Harris is one, have held significant honours, including Jimmy Savile and Cyril Smith. They used their power and cloak of respectability to abuse children.'

Mr Danczuk had only this week written to Cabinet Secretary Francis Maude asking him for an update on plans to strip Harris of his CBE.

He added: 'They have come close to bringing the whole honours system into disrepute, and you would have their honours would have been removed more quickly.

'The Australians acted more quickly against Rolf Harris than we did.'

Harris, once among the Queen's favourite entertainers, was first honoured in the late 1960s with an MBE, followed by an OBE a decade later

He was awarded CBE in 2006, a year after he painted The Queen's 80th birthday portrait.

But he was jailed in July last year for nearly six years for 12 indecent assaults against four girls in the UK between 1968 and 1986.

During sentencing, Mr Justice Sweeney told him: 'Your reputation lies in ruins. You have been stripped of your honours and you have no one to blame but yourself.'

Seven of the 12 counts related to the friend of Harris's daughter Bindi, including one incident when she was 15 when he seriously sexually assaulted her while Bindi slept in the adjacent bed.

Earlier this week, Harris was stripped of his Order of Australia honour and he has also had his BAFTA Fellowship removed.

The entertainer's conviction caused widespread revulsion in Australia and Britain, where his television programs were watched by millions of children.

All public traces of the entertainer have been removed from his home town of Bassendean in Western Australia following his convictions, while a plaque outside his childhood home has been demolished.

His artworks have also been removed from the council chambers, and his status as a freeman of the city has been revoked.

Harris, whose fortune is estimated at £11 million was the second person to be convicted under a wide-ranging police investigation set up in the wake of revelations that the late Jimmy Savile, a fellow BBC star, was a prolific abuser.

Campaigners criticised the Government last month after it emerged Harris still held a CBE six months after his conviction.
