Champions League qualification looks all but  Bayer Leverkusen's  after the German club came out on top in a five-goal thriller at FC Copenhagen to win 3-2.

All was going according to plan when Leverkusen took a fifth-minute lead through striker Stefan Kiessling, only for the home side to sting them twice immediately after.

Mathias Jorgensen and Daniel Amartey nabbed a goal apiece in the eighth and 13th minute respectively to give Copenhagen a 2-1 lead that they couldn't hold on to until half time.

It was Karim Bellarabi and Heung-Min Son who turned the 2-1 deficit into a 3-2 advantage, and put qualification into the Champions League firmly in the Bundesliga club's favour.

Elsewhere, Red Bull Salzburg were kept on their toes by Swedish counterparts Malmo in Austria.

Home side Salzburg looked comfortable throughout, netting  through Franz Schiemer and Jonathan Soriano in either half to emerge with a healthy 2-0 lead going into the dying moments.

Malmo, though,  gave themselves a glimmer of hope with an away goal via striker Emil Forsberg in the 91st minute to travel back to Sweden having lost 2-1.

Steaua Bucharest emerged victorious in their first leg against Ludogrets Razgrad, winning 1-0.

The game looked destined to finish a stalemate until Alexsandru Chipciu struck in the 88th minute to give the home side the advantage.

That allowed the attacking midfielder to make amends after Chipciu missed a penalty in the first half.

Ludogrets must now respond or be eliminated from the Champions League qualifiers this Wednesday in Bulgaria.
