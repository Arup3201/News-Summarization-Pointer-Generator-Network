Having a lumpy mattress and a snoring partner could soon be a thing of the past thanks to a 'smart' adjustable bed that monitors how well you sleep.

Sensors fitted inside the mattress of the Sleep Number x12
bed measure breathing, heart rate and movement to analyse you and your partner's sleeping patterns.

Firmness and elevation can be adjusted by remote control, or
via voice commands, and the mattress can also massage sleepers.

Sensors fitted inside the mattress of the Sleep Number x12 bed, pictured, measure breathing, heart rate and movement. The £5,000 smart bed can also massage sleepers and is due to go on sale in the U.S. later this year

It was created by U.S-based firm Select Comfort, which makes
mattresses with adjustable firmness as well as bedding and air mattresses.

Any data collected by the sensors is sent wirelessly to a
smartphone app and sleepers are given a SleepIQ score.

The app then gives tailored advice and tips on how to sleep
better, along with which firmness and elevation levels will work best - each with
colour coded graphs that track progress.

Firmness and elevation of the bed, left, can be adjusted by remote control, right, or via voice commands. For example, saying 'Sleep Number Firmer' will make the mattress firmer. The mattress can also massage sleepers, and there is a soft light under the bed that can be switched on and off by this remote

Settings are adjusted by remote control, or via voice
commands. For example, saying ‘Sleep Number Firmer’ will make the mattress
firmer.

The mattress also has different massage settings, and there is a soft
light under the bed that can be switched on and off by this remote.

Other settings include a Favorites button, that lets users
set popular bed positions including Read and Watch TV, and users can also change the position of the bed on their partner’s side to stop them from
snoring.

Sensors fitted inside the mattress measure average
breathing, average heart rate and the user’s movement to track how they’re sleeping.

This data is sent wirelessly to a smartphone app and
sleepers are given a SleepIQ score.

The app then gives tailored advice and tips
on how to sleep better, and advises users of their optimum firmness levels.

This app uses a simple colour coding system to show changes and
progression.

Firmness and elevation of any part of the bed can be
adjusted by remote control, pictured right, or via voice commands.

For example, saying ‘Sleep
Number Firmer’ will make the mattress firmer.

The mattress can also massage sleepers, and there is a soft
light under the bed that can be switched on and off by remote.

Other settings including a Favorites button that lets users
set popular bed positions, which can also be pre-programmed, including Read and
Watch TV.

Users can even change the position of the bed on their
partner’s side to stop them from snoring, for example.

The bed is due to go on sale in the U.S. later this year, although the exact date has not been announced.

A standard mattress costs $7,999 (£4,870) and for $15,399 (£9,380) customers also get an upholstered bed, side panel and nightstand.

The company unveiled the bed at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show.

As well as its own smart features, the mattress comes with Bluetooth technology meaning it can also connect to other smart devices, such as TVs, lights and more.

Once connected, these gadgets can also be controlled by the remote.

This image, created by London-based design scientist Melissa Sterry, shows the bedroom of the future. It features beds that monitor health and bedsheets that respond to changes in temperature. One day there could even be a holographic companion that can read bedtime stories to soothe people to sleep
