'Revolutionary': Remescar, which retails at £19, is said to reduce the appearance of scars in weeks

With spring in the air, many women will already be fretting about getting in shape for  the summer.

But if you are among the millions who dread having to uncover unsightly stretch marks on your bikini body, help is at hand.

A revolutionary scar treatment that claims to reduce the appearance of the white streaks by half in less than a month has just become available on the high street.

Remescar, which has been developed by scientists in Belgium, works by covering the scar or stretch mark in a thin, invisible film of silicone.

This protects the top layer of skin in its own healing ‘micro-environment’, sealing in moisture and helping stimulate the production of collagen, which boosts the skin’s recovery.

The treatment, which comes in a cream or handy deodorant-style stick, also includes beta glucan, a naturally occurring plant or yeast extract which has a proven protective and hydrating effect on wounds, and powerful SPF15 UV filters to shield against sun damage.

In clinical trials, users who applied it twice a day said they noticed a 50 per cent reduction in the appearance of their stretch marks in only 28 days.

Patients with both existing and new scars, caused by minor surgery, burns, acne or accidents, who used the treatment, also reported a reduction in the length and height of their scarring.

They said the treatment helped to restore their skin to a more normal colour and texture, helping scars to fade and diminish. Sensations of burning, tingling and itching were  also reduced.

Nine in ten British women are affected by stretch marks.

Although pregnancy is one of the most common causes, they can also affect teenagers and young women who have not yet started a family.

Growth spurts and weight fluctuations can result in marks on the thighs and ‘love handles’, much to the distress of bikini-wearers.

Men can also become victims, with affected areas including the arms, legs and back.

Remescar is on sale from £19.95 for a 5.4g stick in Boots. A 100ml cream will also be available for £24.95.

It is the first time that an easy-to-apply silicone treatment has been made available to the general public in Britain.

Traditional, professional silicone gel or sheet treatments for scars can often cause embarrassment to patients because they are visible to others.

They are more expensive and can be difficult for the user to apply.

Lucy Palmer, 32, from Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex, began using Remescar for scarring caused by teenage acne and chicken pox.

‘For years I wished my complexion was better,’ she said. ‘I was thinking about having the scars softened with laser surgery until I was fortunate enough to be chosen for the trials  for Remescar.

‘I cannot believe how effective it has been. My acne scarring almost halved in just eight weeks and is continuing to fade as the weeks go on.

‘I also tried it on my stretch marks after having my second child and the improvement is unbelievable, better than anything I’ve tried before.’
