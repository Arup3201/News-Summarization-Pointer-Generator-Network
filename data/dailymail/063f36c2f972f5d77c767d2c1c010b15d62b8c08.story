Ahead of his January move to Borussia Dortmund, Red Bull Salzburg midfielder Kevin Kampl has revealed that he was a boyhood fan of the German club.

Bundesliga strugglers Dortmund have agreed to sign Slovenia international Kampl in January for a reported £7million.

Speaking of his move, Kampl told Ruhrnachrichten: 'It's great that it all worked out. I am really happy. As a child I was a BVB fanatic. It's a dream come true to be playing with such a great club.

The 24-year-old has signed a contract through to the summer of 2019, with the 14-cap Slovenia international moving for an undisclosed fee.

'Kevin Kampl is a versatile attacking-midfielder, who we have been observing for some time. His style of play fits in perfectly with our own,' said Borussia Dortmund sporting director Michael Zorc on the club's official website.
