A modest one-cent stamp belonging to the late eccentric heir and famous murderer John du Pont could fetch as much as $20 million when it goes on auction in New York next week.

The magenta stamp, which was used in British Guiana in 1856, has set a new world record on each of the three occasions it's been sold at auction.

And when the one-square inch piece of paper goes under the hammer on June 17, it is expected to set yet another record - and earn the title of the world's most valuable stamp.

It is expected to fetch between $10 million and $20 million.

Costly: David Redden, Vice Chairman of Sotheby's auction house, holds up the British Guiana One-Cent Magenta stamp, which is expected to fetch as much as $20 million when it goes on auction next week

On sale: The stamp cost a single cent when it was used in British Guiana in 1856 - but it is the only one of its kind believed to exist and has set a new world record each time it's been sold at auction

As per du Pont's will, 80 per cent of the proceeds will go to 
the family of his friend, Bulgarian wrestler Valentin Jordanov Dimitrov, and 20 
per cent will go to the Eurasian Pacific Wildlife Foundation, based in Paoli, 
Pennsylvania, which du Pont founded to support wildlife preservation in 
the Pacific.

The stamp, which has rarely been seen since it was last publicly exhibited in 1986, has a rich and colorful history - starting in the hands of a 12-year-old boy before making its way to a murderer.

The stamp went into circulation after a
 shipment of stamps was delayed from London and the postmaster asked 
printers in Georgetown in British Guiana to produce three stamps until 
the shipment arrived: A 1-cent magenta, a 4-cent magenta and a 4-cent 
blue.

While multiple examples of the 4-cent stamps have survived, only this one cent is known to still exist.

Its
 first owner was a 12-year-old Scottish boy living in South America who 
added it to his collection after finding it among family papers in 1873.
 He soon sold it for a few shillings to a local collector, Neil 
McKinnon, so he could afford to buy other stamps.

Owner: John E. du Pont, pictured in 1992, bought the stamp in 1980 and it is being sold off after his death

Arrest: Du Pont jumps from a police van after killing Olympic gold medal wrestler Dave Schultz in 1996

John du Pont, a multimillionaire and chemical heir in the prominent du Pont family, was convicted in 1997 of murdering Olympic 
gold medal-winning wrestler David Schultz, 36, who had been training athletes and living 
at du Pont's 800-acre Foxcatcher Farm in Delaware County, Pennsylvania. His wife and children were also on the estate.

Schultz's
 wife and du Pont's head of security witnessed him shooting Schultz - a 
long-term friend - three times on January 26, 1996.

Du Pont then locked himself inside his 
mansion for two days.

Police
 negotiated with him on the phone before switching off his power and 
eventually arresting him when he ventured outside to fix his heater.

No
 motive was ever offered for the murder, although friends had noted was 
acting erratically beforehand, and an expert witness testified he was a 
paranoid schizophrenic who thought Schultz was going to kill him.

Du
 Pont, who was found to be mentally ill but not insane, was convicted of
 murder in the third degree after the court rejected his plea of not 
guilty by reason of insanity.

He died of acute aspiration pneumonia in prison in 2010, aged 72.

McKinnon
 kept it for five years before selling it to a Liverpool dealer who 
recognized the unassuming stamp as highly uncommon. He paid 120 pounds 
for it and quickly resold it for 150 pounds to Count Philippe la 
Renotiere von Ferrary, one of the world's greatest stamp collectors.

Upon his death in 1917, the count bequeathed his stamp collection to the Postmuseum in Berlin.

The
 collection was later seized by France as war reparations and sold off 
in a series of 14 auctions with the One-Cent Magenta bringing $35,000 in
 1922 - an auction record for a single stamp.

Arthur
 Hind, a textile magnate from Utica, New York, was the buyer. Among 
those bidding against him was King George V. It is the one major piece 
absent from the Royal Family's heirloom collection.

Upon
 Hind's death in 1933, the stamp was put into an auction with the rest 
of his collection but was withdrawn after his widow, who claimed it was 
left to her, brought a lawsuit.

The
 next owner was Frederick Small, an Australian engineer living in 
Florida who purchased it privately from Hind's widow for $45,000 in 
1940. Thirty years later, he consigned the stamp to a New York auction 
where it was purchased by an investment consortium for $280,000 - 
another record.

The stamp set its third record in 1980
 when it sold for $935,000 to JE du Pont, a multimillionaire and 
chemical heir in the prominent du Pont family.

He was convicted in 1997 of murdering Olympic 
gold medal-winning wrestler David Schultz, 36, who was training and living 
at du Pont's 800-acre Foxcatcher Farm in Delaware County, Pennsylvania.

Killed: Du Pont, left, was found to be mentally ill when he shot dead Olympic wrestler David Schultz, left and right, at his estate. The wrestler had been training the Olympic team at the time of the killing in 1996

Scene: Du Pont locked himself inside his mansion in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania for two days until police switched off his power and caught him when he went outside to fix a heater

1856 The
 stamp went into circulation after a
 shipment of stamps was delayed from London. Printers in British Guiana 
produced three stamps - including the one cent - to serve in their place
 until the shipment arrived.

1873 Louis
 Vernon Vaughan, 12, discovered the stamp in letter left by his uncle. 
The boy sells it to a local collector for six shillings, about $1.44 
today.

1878 McKinnon
 sold it to a Liverpool dealer who 
recognized it as uncommon. He paid 120 pounds 
for it and resold it for 150 pounds to Count Philippe la 
Renotiere von Ferrary, one of the world's greatest stamp collectors.

1917
 The count bequeathed his stamp collection to the Postmuseum in Berlin -
 but it was later seized by France as war reparations and sold off 
in a series of 14 auctions with the One-Cent Magenta bringing $35,000 in
 1922.

1940 Its buyer, Arthur
 Hind, a textile magnate from Utica, New York, died in 1933 and in 1940, it was sold privately by his widow to Frederick Small for $45,000

1970 The stamp was put up for auction and it was purchased by an investment consortium for $280,000.

1980 J.E. du Pont bought the stamp for $935,000.

June 17, 2014 The stamp will be auctioned by Sotheby's in New York, where it is expected to fetch as much as $20 million

Schultz's
 wife and du Pont's head of security witnessed him shooting Schultz - a 
long-term friend - three times before he locked himself inside his 
mansion for two days.

Police negotiated with him on the phone before switching off his power and eventually arresting him when he ventured outside to fix his heater.

No motive was ever offered for the murder, although friends had noted was acting erratically beforehand, and an expert witness testified he was a paranoid schizophrenic who thought Schultz was going to kill him.

Du Pont, who was found to be mentally ill but not insane, was convicted of murder in the third degree after the court rejected his plea of not guilty by reason of insanity.

He died of acute aspiration pneumonia in prison in 2010, aged 72.

Du Pont had exhibited the stamp for the last time in Perth, Australia in 1987. Afterwards, the stamp was returned to him on a Sunday and he did not have access to a bank vault until the next day - so he slept with it beneath his pillow.

An 1855 Swedish stamp, which sold for $2.3 million in 1996, currently holds the auction record for a single - but Sotheby's believes the magenta could go for much more.

The stamp arrived with David Redden, director of special projects for Sotheby's, at the Smithsonian museum in April. He carried the stamp in a briefcase and was accompanied by an armed guard.

'It was very, very interesting,' Thomas Lera, the chair of research at the 
Smithsonian National Postal Museum who examined the stamp for Sotheby's, told The News Journal.

'You always want to see for yourself. 
You look at the stamp and you say to yourself, "I actually thought you 
were bigger," and you realize you were looking at enlarged pictures.'

Lera
 was not allowed to touch the stamp, which was removed from its frame 
inside the case with tongs and placed under special lights, the News 
Journal reported.

Where will the story go next? The stamp was initially discovered in 1873 by a 12-year old Scottish boy living in British Guiana, South America who sold it to a local stamp collector for several shillings

Lera said he was struck by the initials of the various owners' imprints, which start with Philipp de la Rénotière von Ferrary's purple trefoil and end with 'JEdp' - for du Pont - written in pencil.

Doug Gaul, an appraiser at Dutch Country Auctions, said whoever purchases the stamp will be buying a story rather than an object of intrinsic value.

'As far as stamps go, it's not a particularly attractive stamp,' he said. 'But it's such an aura, such a story, it's like a pot of gold. The person who wins that gets to be part of that story, and gets to add his name to that story.'

The stamp is the only major stamp absent from the British Royal Family's private Royal Philatelic Collection.

'This is the superstar of the stamp world,' said Redden.
