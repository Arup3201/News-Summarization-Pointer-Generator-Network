No Macy's employees were involved in the detention or questioning of a black actor who claims he was stopped because of his race while shopping at the flagship Manhattan department store, Macy's officials said Sunday.

Rob Brown, a black actor who works on the HBO series 'Treme,' has said he was detained nearly an hour by police on June 8 after employees contacted authorities about possible credit card fraud. The actor has filed a lawsuit.

In a statement, Macy's said there was no record of any employee contacting authorities about Mr Brown's purchase. The store said police officers requested use of a room in the building and that request was granted.

The store said it was reaching out to Mr Brown, and continuing to investigate the situation.

Mr Brown's account comes after claims from two black shoppers said they were racially profiled at Barneys New York.

Trayon Christian sued Barneys, saying he was accused of fraud after using his debit card to buy a $349 Ferragamo belt in April. Kayla Philips filed a notice of claim saying she would sue after she was stopped by detectives outside the store when she bought a $2,500 Celine handbag in February.

As the criticism grew, Barneys said it had retained a civil rights expert to help review its procedures. The CEO of Barneys, Mark Lee, offered his 'sincere regret and deepest apologies.'

Kirsten John Foy, an official with the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network, said he would meet with Barneys officials on Tuesday to discuss the racial profiling allegations.
