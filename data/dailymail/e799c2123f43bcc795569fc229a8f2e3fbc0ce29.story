Tomas Kanaporis has come forward to claim that the mystery man, pictured, is his missing brother Alvydas

A man found wandering in a park two months ago unable to remember anything about himself asked the public to identify him last night.

Staff at the hospital where he is being cared for have called him Robert, but say his memory has  not improved since he was found on May 18 in  Peterborough, Cambridgeshire.

He is thought to be in his twenties, and is an accomplished basketball player.

He speaks English with an eastern European accent and understands some Russian and Lithuanian.

Dr Manaan Kar Ray, the clinical director of acute care at Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust who has been monitoring Robert, said such extreme amnesia usually only lasted a few hours and was typically caused by a traumatic event ‘such as torture or a natural disaster’.

He added: ‘I have been a psychiatrist for 15 years and I have never seen anything like this.

'It’s like something out of the movies.

‘There are very few clues for us to go on.

'The only thing we know is that he does have an interest in playing sports. We asked him if he liked basketball and he said he didn’t know what that was.

'But when we took him to play with other people he picked up the ball and knew exactly what to do.’

Robert said: ‘The last few weeks have 
been truly horrible. I go through so many emotions. At times I am angry,
 frustrated, depressed, lost and confused.

‘I just need to find out my name and I hope someone out there will recognise me and help.’

Robert,
 who is 5ft 9in, weighs 13 stone and has dark hair and blue eyes, was 
not carrying a mobile phone or any identifying documents when he was 
found in a confused state.

In
 2005, an accomplished musician who became known as the Piano Man was 
found wandering in Kent. He remained mute for four months in hospital 
but was accused of being a hoaxer after remembering he was Andreas 
Grassl, a 20-year-old German.

The man named 'Robert' by hospital staff was found in a park near a bus station in Peterborough on May 18 and is currently being treated at the Cavell Centre at Peterborough City Hospital

Experts believe he may be Eastern European and say he appears to have a talent for basketball and could be a football fan as he was wearing a Champions League watch when found

Robert is currently at the Cavell Centre at Peterborough City Hospital, where experts are trying to help him regain his memory.

But nearly two months since he was found there has been no improvement in his condition.

However, Robert’s doctors say they have one clue to help him remember his lost life - his apparent talent for basketball.

Medics asked the mystery man if he liked the sport but he said he had never heard of it.

But when Robert was thrown a basketball he knew exactly what to do and ran rings around the competition.

He has also been playing football and tennis with fellow patients at a mental health unit on the outskirts of Peterborough.

Doctors believe Robert is also a football fan because he was wearing a Champions League watch when he was picked up by police.

Consultant pyschiatrist Dr Mannan Kar Ray, left, is treating Robert and says he has never seen an amnesia case as severe as this

But he has not watched a single World Cup match and has no idea which team he supports.

Dr Kar-Ray added: 'There are very few clues for us to go on.

'When he was found he was wearing a watch with Champions League written on it, so that would suggest he is a football fan. But he hasn’t watched any of the World Cup and he has no idea what team he supports.

'The only thing we know is that he does have an interest in playing sports.

'We have taken him into Peterborough town centre to see if that triggers anything, but with no success.

'We’ve also taken him to Eastern European groups but no one recognises him.

'At the moment we are drawing a complete blank.'

Cambridgeshire Police say the man is not known to police and does not match any missing persons reports.

Anyone with information on identifying Robert should contact 01733 776014 between 8am and 8pm.
