Neighbors and a bestselling children's author came to a 13-year-old boy's aid after the money he was raising to buy a dog was stolen from his lemonade stand. 

After months of begging his mother for a puppy, Spencer Bergman, from Loudoun County, Virginia, was told he could have a dog if he raised $500 to buy one himself.

Enlisting the help of his 12-year-old friend, Spencer Tarbet, the two set up a lemonade stand.

But as they were shutting up shop for the day, a shirtless man in his early 20s robbed them of their profits.

Spencer Bergman, 13, was challenged by his mother to raise $500 to go towards buying a puppy, but money he had worked for on his lemonade stand was stolen from him

Neighbors and children's author Jeff Kinney rallied together to raise the cash Spencer needed, but in the end he was given a dog, called Coconut, by a friend

When Spencer Bergman called out after the thief, the man shouted back that he would beat them up if they told anyone.

'My heart stopped,' he told the Washington Post. 'We were bursting into tears.'

As news of the robbery spread, the boys' neighbors and friends clubbed together to help the boys recoup their money.

But their generosity was so great that Spencer was well on his way to reaching his target.

He said: 'People would hand in a $20 and they would let us keep the change.'

A local music shop owner even bought the boys a book - Diary of a Wimpy Kid - tucking $15 and a note inside, which said: 'Please don't lose faith in people.'

The boys' story reached the author of Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Jeff Kinney, who Skyped Spencer and his friend, giving them a total of $150.

The boys' story reached the bestselling book's author, Jeff Kinney, who Skyped the pair and sent them $150.

Mr Kinney, whose book was turned into a film in 2010, said: 'My heart really went out to these kids.

'My junior high years were really tough — to leave the safe cocoon of elementary school and go into what felt like the Wild West. Everyone wants to respond by showing these kids the better side of humanity.'

And just as Spencer was about to reach his $500 target, one of his neighbors decided to give him their dog, a Westie called Coconut.

The money raised will now go towards helping Coconut get settled in to his new home, as well as a dog Halloween costume, the 13-year-old said.
