The founder of Tumblr is doing nothing to change his image as a boy wonder as he has revealed that he loves flying toy drones both in the office and in the open air of Brooklyn.

David Karp, 27, is the CEO of the social media platform and sold the company to Yahoo for $1.1billion earlier this year but that doesn't stop him from acting like a kid in their company headquarters.

'I can have it over on the other side of the office, bothering people while I’m at my desk. Usually I send it straight over my lawyer’s head,' he told New York Magazine in an interview about his management style.

'I’m obsessed with drones right now. I 
fly my drones all over Brooklyn. These things are amazing. These things 
are not regulated. I keep destroying them. I’ve had five of them.'

Man in charge: David Karp, 27, is the founder and CEO of Tumblr and apparently keeps a very relaxed atmosphere in the social media company's office in New York by flying around toy drones

Many automatically associate drones with the unmanned military aircrafts that have been used extensively by President Obama's administration overseas, but the smaller versions are available for personal use.

Karp appears to be a big fan, and his latest hobby is an expensive and elusive one, but that is not much of a concern for the tech giant.

His net worth is said to be in the area of $200million, and that helps him fund this newfound hobby.

'You get them from China, so they all 
come HK Post, which means that you have to wait for them for, 
like—you’re lucky if they come within two months. So I usually have a 
few on order at any given time,' he told the magazine.

Karp founded Tumblr in 2007 and became well-known throughout the business world when the site was purchased in May.

Money to burn: Karp orders the drones from China and he has plenty to spend after selling his company for $1.1billion to Yahoo (seen here with Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer in May)

Some of the more astounding details of the deal were only revealed last month when the regulatory filings were made public, disclosing that he gets an additional $81million if he stays at the head of the company for the next four years.

Though the slight man is described as being a rather unassuming CEO figure in the New York magazine profile, he has made one decidedly corporate decision since taking on the role.

Shortly after being bought by Yahoo, Tumblr began running ads- first on their mobile site then on desktop-accessed versions as well.

The move marked a 180-turn for Karp, as he previously said in 2010 that the thought of running ads on the free web service 'really turns our stomachs'.
