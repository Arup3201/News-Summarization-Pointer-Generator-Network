Presenter Jenni Murray has criticised the sexism she said is still rife in the classical music world

Presenter Jenni Murray has criticised the sexism she said is still rife in the classical music world.

The veteran host of Woman’s Hour on Radio 4 pointed to the way female performers are  marketed to the public.

‘The women who seem to be most welcome are the ones who are prepared to go along with the old idea that sex sells,’ she said. 

Miss Murray, 63, made her comments to Radio Times as she announced she will conduct the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra – despite not being able to read music.

She continued: ‘Look at the way the violinist Nicola Benedetti and trumpeter Alison Balsom are marketed.

‘The BBC is not entirely blameless in this  matter.  For the first time this year, the Last Night of the Proms – that wonderful night in the  classical music calendar – will be conducted by a woman, the American genius Marin Alsop. It only took 119 years to get there.’

The broadcaster said the drive for equality of the sexes in classical music has been ‘shockingly’ slower than in other walks of life, leaving women ‘downgraded, excluded and downright insulted’.

She cited incidents where female musicians have been undermined by colleagues.

These included a woodwind player who was told her clarinet practice must improve her talent in ‘other departments’.

One percussion player was told she would be better off as a housewife.

Miss Murray highlighted how women who play in orchestras can be discriminated against because of their appearance.

In 2000, conductor Leonard Slatkin told The Times he did not want overweight women in his orchestra.

‘I tend to favour covered arms, especially among the violinists,’ he said. ‘You don’t want to see too much flapping about.’

Even the language used can be biased against women, added Miss Murray.

‘Maestro suggests a man of extraordinary  talent in complete control of his players.

‘Diva implies a difficult and demanding woman, verging on hysteria,’ she said.

The radio star will be given just one 
lesson by conductor Jessica Cottis before facing the BBC Philharmonic 
Orchestra on June 21.

For the first time this year, the Last Night of the Proms will be conducted by a woman, the American Marin Alsop (pictured)

Her performance will feature the 
Overture to Bizet’s opera Carmen in a live broadcast of a special 
edition to mark women in music.

She
 admitted to having limited experience, saying: ‘I studied music at 
school but only as far as the fourth form – many years ago. I was 
excellent at appreciation, not so good on the practical side, gave up 
piano after four lessons (I hated the teacher) and played triangle in 
the school band.

‘I shall 
have a few hours’ training. I do know the piece. I shall, I hope, 
terrify the players into submission with the power of my baton and by 
peering at them over the top of my specs.’
