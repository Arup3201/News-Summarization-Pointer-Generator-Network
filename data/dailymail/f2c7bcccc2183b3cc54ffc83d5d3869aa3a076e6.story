For centuries people have marked the passing of time using the moon’s phases.

But only now is the world's first moon clock being planned, which will use tidal power to display the moon's phase on its 'face'.

The huge sculpture is intended to sit at the historic centre of time at Greenwich, London, as part of a huge redevelopment of the Greenwich peninsula.

The world's first moon clock  is being planned and would use tidal power to display the size and position of the moon on its three concentric rings (pictured).

Size: 131ft (40metres) wide and 43ft (13metres) tall.

Materials: Recycled glass will be used for the rings.

Power: The clock would use tidal power to turn turbines and generate electricity.

Location: Greenwich, on the bank of the Thames to the west of the O2 Arena.

Cost: Around £6million with an estimate of £9.6million for the whole project.

Opening date:  Autumn 2016 if all goes to plan.

The clock, which is called Aluna, will measure 131ft (40 metres) wide and 43ft (13metres) high if it is built on the bank of the Thames, just west of the O2 Arena, as planned.

It would be made of three concentric glass rings with LEDs beneath the surface, producing light powered by tidal turbines.

The recycled glass rings would show the waxing, waning, rising and setting of the moon, along with the ebb and flow of the tides. By looking at how each of the rings are illuminated, people will be able to tell the phase and position of the moon and the height of the tides.

The ‘flow of light’ will move slowly and continuously around the structure in a clockwise direction, according to the project’s creators.

The moon creates the tides and the clock will transform them into kinetic energy and then electricity by using turbines that are planned to sit in the Thames

The largest ring, called 
the 'Lunar Phase', would show the waxing and waning of the moon, which takes 
29.5 calendar days.

At New Moon, the unlit ring would begin to gradually ‘wax’ on and by full moon, the whole ring will light up so that the circle of light is complete. The ring would then ‘wane’ back to its unlit state and the cycle would begin again.

The 24 hour 50 minute Lunar Day is represented by a ring positioned half way between the first ring and the ground. A band of light is intended to point to the moon’s position in the sky and when it is below the horizon, there will be a ring lit below a viewer’s feet.

A smaller band of light will follow the progress of the tides, with each cycle taking 12 hours and 25 minutes.

The clock is intended to be visible 24 
hours a day as it would emit white light in the dark, which would fade 
as the sun rises, while the edges of the structure are designed to be 
lit up with coloured LEDs to save a little energy.

If built, Aluna will be powered by the very 
thing it is designed to measure – the moon. It is well known that the 
moon creates the tides and the clock would transform them into kinetic 
energy and then electricity by using turbines that are planned to sit in
 the Thames.

Efficient 
use of renewable energy is one of the project's primary objectives and 
when the largest ring is unlit around New Moon, the clock would conserve 
more energy than it uses and store it for Full Moon times

The team behind the project says it has had a favourable response from Greenwich Council who have agreed to the clock in principle. An initial feasibility report has been submitted to the authority ahead of the formal plans, which are set to be unveiled and lodged in the summer.

A spokesman for the project said: ‘Aluna will be the world's first tidal powered moon clock, and a monumental timepiece for Greenwich, London, the UK and the world.’

Construction would take around 16 months and the organisers hope the project will be completed in autumn 2016 in time for the lunar eclipse set for that year.

The people behind the project, including London-based artist Laura Williams, who came up with the design in 2002 when studying Art at Central Saint Martins, London, hope it will change the way people consider time and understand our planet.

The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, said the clock ‘would showcase the best of British creativity and engineering and offer inspiring opportunities for intercultural dialogue and understanding.

‘Powered by the tidal river Thames and built from glass recycled by Londoners themselves, a world first like Aluna would draw international visitors and engage Londoners.

‘Greenwich Riverside is identified as a Strategic Cultural Area in the London Plan and I believe Aluna could act as a focal point for the cultural regeneration of this area.’

It is estimated that Aluna could cost around £6million - with an estimated cost of £9.6million for the whole project - and is being funded from a variety of sources, including donations, sponsors and grants.
