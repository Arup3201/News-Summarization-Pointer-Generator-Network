Sunderland boss Gus Poyet looks set to make a renewed move for Liverpool’s Fabio Borini in January.

In what was one of the ‘Will he? Won’t he?’ transfer sagas of the summer, the Italian kept the Black Cats waiting until the final week of the window before telling them he intended to stay with the Anfield club, who had accepted a £14million bid for the striker.

Borini had enjoyed a season-long loan spell at the Stadium of Light, and Poyet remains an admirer.

Sunderland travel to Liverpool on Saturday and Poyet is hoping that a good reception from the travelling fans could let Borini know he is still appreciated on Wearside.

‘I hope our fans will give him a terrific reception,’ said the Uruguayan.

‘I would like them to because he deserves it. He is one of those players who, for some reason, everyone thought would be here so we never really wanted to say goodbye to him. But he is not here so it is a good opportunity for us to say thank you to Fabio.’

Borini scored 10 times for Sunderland last season and, without his guile, they have failed to net in seven of their 14 league matches this term.

Poyet admits he has been a miss. ‘Goals are very expensive so we have missed him a lot,’ he added.

‘I think we are learning now but the higher you go there are some players when you know them well they become a little bit more expensive. When you know a player and you know what you are going to get in any division it makes a difference.’

Borini has appeared eight times for the Reds this season, starting only once in the Premier League, and Poyet says he would have perhaps been better placed under his care.

‘In terms of quantity of games he probably did not make the right decision,’ he said.

‘In terms of quality probably yes, because he has played in the Champions League.’
