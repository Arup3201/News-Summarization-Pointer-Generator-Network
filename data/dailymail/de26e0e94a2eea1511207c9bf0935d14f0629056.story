All evacuation orders 
were lifted Sunday as firefighters gained the upper hand on the 
remaining four of nearly a dozen blazes that tore through Southern 
California last week - while the governor warned the state was gearing 
up for what could be one of the drought-stricken region's worst wildfire
 seasons.

Gov. Jerry Brown told ABC's This 
Week that the state has 5,000 firefighters and has appropriated $600 
million to battling blazes, but that may not be enough in the future.

'We're
 getting ready for the worst,' Brown said. 'Now, we don't want to 
anticipate before we know, but we need a full complement of firefighting
 capacity.'

The state firefighting agency went to peak staffing in the first week of April, instead of its usual start in mid-May.

Thousands
 of additional firefighters may be needed in the future, Brown said, 
adding that California is on the 'front lines' of climate change that is
 making its weather hotter.

All evacuation 
orders were lifted Sunday as ocean breezes and lower temperatures over 
the weekend allowed firefighters to get the upper hand on the remaining 
fires. They included a 4-square-mile blaze that started in the suburb of
 San Marcos and three brush fires at Camp Pendleton.

Unusually
 high temperatures, low humidity and gusty winds set conditions last 
week for the string of wildfires that broke out in San Diego County, 
causing more than $20 million in damage.

The 
California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection has responded to 
more than 1,500 fires this year, compared with about 800 during an 
average year.

'And in the years to come, we're
 going to have to make very expensive investments and adjust,' Brown 
said. 'And the people are going to have to be careful of how they live, 
how they build their homes and what kind of vegetation is allowed to 
grow around them.'

Firefighters over the weekend scoured charred hillsides north of San Diego to guard against a resurgence of flames.

The
 fires spanning 39 square miles chewed a destructive path through San 
Diego County, destroying at least 47 houses, an 18-unit apartment 
complex and three businesses. Officials were still assessing the damage.

A badly burned body was found in a transient camp, and one firefighter suffered heat exhaustion.

Most
 homes were destroyed in two suburbs about 30 miles north of San Diego -
 San Marcos, an inland commuter city of new housing tracts, and 
Carlsbad, a coastal community and home of Legoland California.

The
 first blaze started Tuesday and was caused by a spark from construction
 equipment, according to state officials. It could take months to get to
 the bottom of the most damaging fires.

Alberto
 Serrato, 57, pleaded not guilty Friday to an arson charge in connection
 with one of the smaller fires, but authorities say they don't believe 
he started it, just added brush to it.

Firefighters
 doused remaining hotspots with hoses and water-filled backpacks, sawed 
large logs and raked soil with shovels and other hand tools to ensure 
the ground was moist enough to prevent fires from returning.
