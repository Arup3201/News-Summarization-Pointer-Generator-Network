Broiling heat is blasting the West again today in a deadly heatwave across Southern California, Arizona on Nevada that has a chance to break records.

Forecasters have their eye on Palm Springs, California, which they say could break the world record highest temperature, reaching in excess of 134 degrees Fahrenheit today.

The heat has already claimed one life.

Paramedics responded to a Las Vegas home without air conditioning on Saturday and found an elderly man dead. The man had medical issues and paramedics thought the heat worsened his condition.

Highs in Las Vegas reached 115 on Saturday, the fourth-hotted temperature ever recorded in the city.

In Death Valley, California, an 
unofficial thermometer recorded a reading of 130 degrees - just short of
 the 134-degree reading from a century ago that stands as the highest 
temperature ever recorded on Earth.

Official readings from Saturday placed the temperature at a balmy 125 degrees.

The National Weather Service shifted its focus on Sunday to Palm Springs, in the Inland Empire, where they said the mercury could climb above the 134 mark.

Temperatures topped out there at 122 on Saturday.

The city of 44,000 107 miles east of Los Angeles sits in a valley and is known for its extreme heat. It is just 440 feet above sea level.

Paramedics said another elderly man suffered a heat stroke when the air conditioner in his car went out for several hours while he was on a long road trip. He stopped in Las Vegas, called 911 and was taken to the hospital in serious condition.

The heat wave has sent more than 40 
other people to hospitals in Las Vegas since it arrived Friday, but no 
life-threatening injuries were reported.

'We will probably start to see a rise in calls Sunday and Monday as the event prolongs,' the fire department said in a statement. 'People's bodies will be more agitated the longer the event lasts and people may require medical assistance.'

In Phoenix, the mercury soared to 119 
degrees - the fourth-highest temperature ever recorded for the Arizona 
city. At
 Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, U.S. Airways canceled 18 
flights because the company's smaller planes could not handle the 
extreme heat. The larger Boeing and Airbus jetliners were not effected.

National
 Weather Service meteorologists in Phoenix baked cooking in their 
government-issued van - which reached temperatures of an estimated 200 
degrees Saturday.

The cookies took four hours to cook and reportedly tasted 'just like they came out of the oven.'

The heat was so punishing that rangers 
took up positions at trailheads at Lake Mead in Nevada to persuade 
people not to hike. Zookeepers in Phoenix hosed down the elephants and 
fed tigers frozen fish snacks.

'This is the hottest time of the year, 
but the temperatures that we'll be looking at for Friday through Sunday,
 they'll be toward the top,’ said National Weather Service meteorologist
 Mark O'Malley. 'It's going to be baking hot across much of the entire 
West.'

Death Valley, which is listed as a 
national park, is dotted with locations such as Furnace Creek and 
Dante's View, and officials are urging people to exercise extreme 
caution during the heat wave.

But
 sweltering heat is often a big draw for visitors - especially tourists 
from Germany and France - with hotels already booked solid during the 
hotter months of July and August.

The heat is the result of a 
high-pressure system brought on by a shift in the jet stream, the 
high-altitude air current that dictates weather patterns. The jet stream
 has been more erratic in the past few years.

In
 Las Vegas, some 200 people attending an outdoor concert at Silverton 
Casino learned the hard way the dangers of extreme heat when they had to
 be treated for weather-related nausea, vomiting and fatigue.

As
 many as 30 of the unfortunate concertgoers were taken to area hospitals
 for further treatment, according to the local fire department.

Meanwhile, in Arizona at least seven people have been found dead over the past week after falling victim to the brutal heat.

Air travellers have to deal with other
 problems, as bigger jetliners can handle temperatures around 126 and 
127 degrees, but smaller planes may have flights delayed.

If the temperature tops 118, the air becomes less dense and changes liftoff conditions.

Since the start of the extreme 
temperatures, officials have expressed concern about immigrants who 
cross the desert border between Mexico and Arizona, because many succumb
 to exhaustion and dehydration in more mild temperatures.

At
 least seven bodies of immigrants have been found in the last week in 
Arizona, and agents in the Tucson sector rescued more than 170 people 
from the desert during a 30-day stretch in May and June when 
temperatures were even lower than expected in the coming days.
