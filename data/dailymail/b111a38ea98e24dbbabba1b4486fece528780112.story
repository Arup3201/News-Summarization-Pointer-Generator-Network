Corporal Russell Aston was killed in action in southern Iraq in 2003. His family are suing the Ministry of Defence for negligence

The family of one of six Red Caps murdered by a mob in Iraq is suing the Ministry of Defence for up to £250,000.

It follows a landmark ruling by the Supreme Court last month that UK soldiers in war zones are covered by human rights laws.

Corporal Russell Aston was one of the Royal Military Policemen cornered and slaughtered by hundreds of locals at a police station in Majar al Kabir, near Basra, in June 2003. The killers have never been brought to justice.

Legal papers lodged on behalf of Cpl Aston’s family allege commanders failed to take ‘reasonable’ measures to keep the Red Caps safe when they were deployed to the hostile town.

The families of all six soldiers have long maintained the soldiers’ deaths were preventable.

They claim commanders failed to give the Red Caps sufficient ammunition to defend themselves as well as roadworthy vehicles and effective communications to call in support.

An inquest into their deaths in 2006 recorded a verdict of  unlawful killing and heard evidence the soldiers had too little ammunition, old radios and  no satellite phone when they were ambushed.

If the Aston family claim is successful, it could lead to yet more legal action against the MoD.

John Miller, father of Corporal Simon Miller who was also killed in the attack, said he too will sue.

‘It could be classed as a blunt 
sword, but all I’ve wanted is to get these people into court and for the
MoD to accept the failings that were identified by the board of 
enquiry.

‘Nothing else would give me greater 
satisfaction, and I know nothing will bring my amazing son back, but if 
we could get that justice and admission

of guilt, my wife and I could 
turn the chapter and pick up the threads of the life we once had.’

‘If we could get that justice and admission of guilt, my wife and I could turn the chapter and pick up the threads of the life we once had,’ he added.

An MoD spokesman said: ‘Our thoughts remain with the families of those who lost their lives. However, it would be inappropriate to comment on any forthcoming legal proceedings.

The five men who died alongside Cpl Aston, from Swadlincote, Derbyshire, were Lance Corporal Thomas Keys, Sergeant Simon Hamilton-Jewell, Corporal Simon Miller, Lance Corporal Ben Hyde and Corporal Paul Long.

An inquest into their deaths in 2006 recorded a verdict of unlawful killing and heard evidence the soldiers had too little ammunition, old radios and no satellite phone when they were ambushed.

John Miller, whose son Simon was killed in the attack, said he too will sue the Ministry of Defence.He said: ‘Simon’s patrol should have had a satellite phone and 150 rounds of ammunition; they were denied both, they couldn’t call for help, they couldn’t initiate a firefight because they didn’t have enough ammunition against a mob of 500 firing rocket-propelled grenades and AK-47s assault rifles.

‘Can anyone imagine that situation and be totally useless under it? All we want is an admission of guilt from the MoD. I’m so angry and very, very hurt.
