Michael Wilson, 31, (pictured outside court) took his 75-year-old grandmother Maureen's debit card and stole £9,537 during a number of cash withdrawals

A man who stole nearly £10,000 from his disabled grandmother to fund his cocaine habit has walked free from court despite his relative insisting he 'deserved to go to prison'.

Michael Wilson, 31, took his 75-year-old grandmother Maureen's debit card after moving into her home in Nelson, Lancashire, when her husband Arnold, 74, was admitted to a care home.

The former aircraft engineer made a string of withdrawals from various cashpoints after correctly guessing her pin number and blew her savings on his £1,000-a-week cocaine habit.

The money had been put aside to pay for Arnold's £110-a-week care home fees.

Burnley Crown Court heard how Mrs Wilson only found out about her grandson's habits after she tried to use her debit card while out shopping and was told it had been refused because she was overdrawn.

She said it then emerged he had lost his job but had continued to pretend to go to work.

He admitted theft at court on Friday and was handed an eight-month prison sentence, suspended for a year.

He was also ordered to carry out 240 hours worth of unpaid work, take part in a six month drugs programme and comply with an 8pm to 7am curfew.

However, Mrs Wilson said she was disappointed with the sentence imposed by the judge and said he should've gone to prison.

She said: 'I would like to have seen him gone to prison, I think he deserves it.

'He could be so nice and used to dote on me. It's frightening enough when it's a stranger who robs you but when it's your own relation.

'He has ruined his life. He was a really good looking lad and always very smart. He has been silly, stupid. I have lost a lot of money.

'I haven't seen him since. He has definitely brought shame on the family but I think they are more annoyed than ashamed - annoyed that he could do something like that.

'How did he think I was going to manage in the future - if I go into a home, the house is going to have to go and everything else. He just didn't think about me at all. He was interested in getting the money for drugs.

'It's a disaster. He may say he has remorse but I don't believe him. I can't ever forgive him - there's no chance.'

Wilson had been living with his grandmother for around 12 months after she was left debilitated by a stroke and unable to care for her husband of 53 years who worked as a Rolls Royce engineer.

Mrs Wilson added: 'I needed someone to look after me and he looked after me well.

'He was a kind lad and he was really good, he cooked tea and he would stay. But unbeknown to me he was taking my card and putting it back in my handbag after using it at the bank.

'I was none-the-wiser and the possibility my own grandson could steal from me was the last thing on my mind.'

Mrs Wilson said she believed the missing money from her account was a mistake at first, before contacting the bank after realising her debit card had disappeared.

Inquiries revealed £9,537 was taken from her account in total.

In court, prosecutor Emma Kehoe said: 'It became apparent that the defendant, might have had something to do with what happened.

'Mrs Wilson contacted the building society and got a mini statement. It became apparent there had been a lot of transactions, totalling £9,537, which she just couldn't account for.

'The defendant immediately accepted it was completely and utterly down to him and the family decided the police had to become involved because of the amount that had been taken.'

In mitigation for Wilson, who has served two months behind bars while on remand, defence counsel Robert Elias said: 'I have to acknowledge the sense of betrayal of a family member going behind your back and emptying your bank account.

'She probably would have given him money if he had had the courage to ask.'

Mr Elias said at the time, Wilson was living 'something of a Walter Mitty existence' and added: 'He was leaving the house, pretending to go to work and kidding himself, as he couldn't accept or come to terms with his position.

'That bubble of self-deception, as well as deceiving others, can't go on for very long. He has had a wake-up call.

'There's really no useful interest in incarcerating him any further. He has been punished by the wake-up call of incarceration for his own welfare.'

Passing sentence, the judge, Mr Recorder Barrie Searle, said: 'This was a serious breach of trust. It was a betrayal. It was unpleasant.

'Clearly, you did not have permission to use that bank card in the way that you did.

'A lady of these years is probably not used to this sort of treatment when she goes into a shop and I can imagine the worry she must have suffered at that age.

'Although I have not seen a victim impact statement, I am using my common sense as to how she must have felt.

'I don't know whether the money will be recovered by her and whether that will put her mind at rest, but the fact is the damage has been done.

'There are many who say, to use a cliché, that the clang of the prison gates would have a real effect on somebody like you. It has been a very chastening experience and it has been a wake-up call.

'I take the view that you have had your punishment because you went to custody for the first time in your life and it has had an impact upon you.'
