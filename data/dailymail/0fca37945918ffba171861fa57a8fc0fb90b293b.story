Questioned: Police have confiscated the phone of driver Darriean Hess, pictured, and are questioning her to determine what caused her to cross the center line and strike the cyclists

A mother-of-two and her friend were killed on Saturday after they were struck by a 20-year-old female driver during a 100-mile charity cycle ride.

Pamela Wells, 60, of South Hamilton, Massachusetts and Elise Bouchard, 52, of Danvers, Massachusetts died and two other riders were injured when Darriean Hess plowed into them at around 8:30 a.m. on Neil R. Underwood Memorial Bridge in Hampton, North Hampshire, police said.

The cyclists had been taking part in the 40th annual Granite State Wheelman Tri-State Seacoast Century Ride when Hess crossed over from the southbound lane to the northbound lane.

After striking the cyclists, deputy police chief Rich Sawyer said Hess' vehicle 'road along' various structures, curbing and sidewalk on the bridge for a distance' before it 'popped back onto the road' and crossed back over to the southbound lane, hitting several road signs.

The vehicle came to a stop after it 'decimated the Welcome to Seabrook Beach sign, Sawyer told the Hampton-Northampton Patch.

Bikers who witnessed the deadly crash were terrified. 'It's tragic. Absolutely tragic! This race has been going on for 40 years and this is awful,' biker Chris Bailey told CBS Local.

Wells' husband, Tom Rogers, said on Sunday that police had told him they were treating the accident as a criminal investigation.

'They have the bicycles. They confiscated her phone, and they took a blood sample. And they have her car,' Rogers said.

The cycling event features two days 
of rides along routes in Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts that 
range from 17 to 108 miles, said Andy Wallenstein, of the Granite State 
Wheelmen bicycling club.

On Saturday, about 1,500 bicyclists 
collectively rode more than 100,000 miles, he said.

Wells was planning to ride 100 miles for the first time and had been working up toward it all summer, Rogers said. She, Bouchard and a third friend logged a 73-mile ride last week.

The three along with Bouchard's boss were struck after they had ridden about 15 miles, Rogers said.In addition to her husband, Wells leaves behind her two children, aged 16 and 17. Bouchard leaves behind her husband, Roger Bouchard.

No charges have been filed against Hess and police are still trying to figure out why Hess lost control of her car. They will presumably check her phone to determine whether she had been talking or texting at the time of the collision.

Hess, who lives in Seabrook, was taken to Portsmouth Regional Hospital for treatment of minor injuries.

She didn't immediately respond to a message from the Associated Press seeking comment.

The bicycling club each year pays police to man various intersections during the event and has nearly 80 volunteers helping, Wallenstein said. 'It's just a tragic event,' he said.

Rogers took to Facebook on Saturday night to mourn his wife, who had been training for the ride, all summer.

'The love of my life, my dear sweet Pam was killed this morning in a horrible accident,' he wrote. 'Pam was the best thing that ever happened to me. We will all miss her greatly.'

Elise Bouchard's neighbors were stunned and heartbroken at the woman's death. 'It's just a shame. I am so shocked,' Ed Brophy said.

In America, fuel taxes solely pay for the roads, that are designed for cars and trucks, period. These freeriders belong in a public park designed for bicycles or on private property. It isn't fair to anyone that they are out on the highway and it is rather dangerous as we can see here. While I feel terrible for the victims of this accident, it was entirely preventable. It is high time for some common sense bicycle laws. Perhaps they should be licensed, taxed and forced to comply with the same rules cars and truck are of they want to share the road with vehicles weighing multiple tons.

"Crossed over into the northbound lane and struck the four bicyclists" and Darriean hasn't been charged? Ummm... how about failing to keep to the right? Failure to stay in the proper lane? Failure to maintain control of the vehicle? That's just for starters.
