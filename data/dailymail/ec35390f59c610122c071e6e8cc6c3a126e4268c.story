Drivers have described the terrifying moment they hit a 'wall of blackness' before dozens of cars collided 'like pinballs in a machine' on the M5 in Somerset killing seven and injuring 51. 

Bristol Crown Court heard how smog built up during and after a fireworks display at Taunton Rugby Club which then drifted across the road.

Collisions began just six minutes after the £3,000 display which had been organised by 51-year-old Geoffrey Counsell, and involved 1,500 shots in 15 minutes.

Drivers on the motorway before the pile-up told a jury how conditions on the road were good until they suddenly hit a 'black wall of smoke' which 'enveloped' their cars

Counsell, of Ashill in Somerset, is charged with breaching health and safety regulations by failing to ensure the safety of others, which he denies.

Drivers on the motorway before the pile-up told a jury at the court how conditions on the road were good until they suddenly hit a 'black wall of smoke' which 'enveloped' their cars on November 4, 2011.

One motorist, David Thompson, said: 'It was hard to be sure as I could not see the lane markings. I found it difficult to know if I was even travelling in a straight line in my lane.

'I felt like I was in free fall, but the only thing I could do was to continue to drive straight.

'I'm not sure if I hit another vehicle or another vehicle hit me.'

Laura Kitchen, a trainee accountant from Honiton, Devon, said: 'I suddenly lost all visibility - it was so sudden it was although someone had just thrown a blanket on my windscreen.

'I couldn't even see the bonnet of my car.'

While TNT lorry driver Perry Mead said he could hear sounds from the firework display by the side of the motorway as he entered the smoke.

He said: 'I could hear sounds of cheering and music like a fairground off to the left.

'There was no visibility at all so I began to break heavily just waiting for when I would hit something.'I felt that at any point something would appear in front of me.

'I couldn't hear the sounds of any vehicle skidding, it seemed as if the vehicles were crashing without braking.'

Stephen Crowle was driving from Plymouth in Devon to Gloucestershire with his wife Susan on the evening of the tragedy.

The couple stopped at Taunton Deane services just after 8pm and rejoined the motorway at around 8.20pm, Mr Crowle told the jury.

'We suddenly hit what I consider almost like a black wall,' Mr Crowle said.

'Visibility dropped dramatically, certainly from almost 200 feet, 200 metres or so, to virtually nothing.

'Thankfully there was very little traffic around. Instinctively, when you are hit with no visibility you brake.

'It was smoke. It was very dark, it was black. After six or seven seconds the road just cleared and that was it really.'

Mrs Crowle, a front-seat passenger in the Nissan Qashqai, added: 'As we passed the junction we suddenly, it was very, very suddenly, came into a wall of blackness.

'It was very dense, we couldn’t see anything. It was obviously very frightening.'

The patch lasted several seconds and then suddenly cleared, said Mrs Crowle who told the jury she had been using that stretch of the M5 since 1975.

'As we carried on out of the blackness, I put my window down.

'It was like the after-smell of fireworks and smoke,' she said.

'My reaction was we were lucky we didn’t hit anything but there wasn’t anything close to us.'

Philip Smith was driving his Peugeot 306 from Plymouth to Windsor with his son-in-law, wife, daughter and granddaughter.

'The weather was clear. Suddenly I drove into what I would describe as a mix of smoke and fog that was black in colour. It came out of nowhere,' he told the jury.

'It was so thick. It was like something out of a movie. It was like you were in a bright room and someone turned the lights off.

'I have never experienced anything like it. It happened so quickly it caused me to brake quite hard.

'Visibility was at zero. It was absolutely black. I couldn’t see the bonnet of my car.

'It was quite scary. It was the worst thing I have driven through.'

A statement read from one driver, named only as Mr Kingsland to the jury, said he was travelling along the motorway in his silver Ford Galaxy car.

'Within a fraction of a second, it seemed my windscreen went completely white, as if a blanket had been thrown over it,” Mr Kingsland said.

'I was completely taken by surprise. The first thing I noticed was three brake lights illuminated in front of me.

'I immediately thought I was going to hit the vehicle in front so braked as hard as I could, it was a full emergency brake situation.

'I can’t remember what happened next apart from to say I was hit at least four to five times from the side to the rear.

'At this point I thought the next was going to kill me and felt very vulnerable.

'I would liken it to being in a pinball machine.'

In another statement, Peter Morgan, said conditions were fine on the motorway until his BMW X5 suddenly hit 'black smoke'.

'My vehicle seemed to be completely enveloped,' Mr Morgan said.

'I had no view out of the front, sides or rear out the windows.

'I then saw the large tail lights of a lorry only a few metres in front of me. I then braked very hard and managed to bring the car to a halt, about ten feet behind the trailer.

'I remember thinking "God, I am stopped on the motorway in thick fog, I need to move". I then felt an impact to the rear offside of my vehicle.'

Richard Thorne, an articulated lorry driver for Langdon Transport with 20 years of experience, had been lying down in the bunk of the lorry while colleague Perry Mead drove.

He told the jury he first felt the brakes being applied 'really, really hard' - leaving him clinging on to the seat in front of the bunk.

'I could only see how thick the windscreen glass was,' Mr Thorne said. 'I couldn’t see anything on the other side of the glass.

'It was just brown, swirling with bits of black stuff in it. I couldn’t see the windscreen wipers.

'I was just holding on because if I had let go I would have just been flung forward onto the windscreen.'

Mr Thorne said he jumped into the front seat as soon as the lorry came to a halt.

'As soon as I sat down, we got hit really hard by another truck,' he said.

Michelle Craker was driving her white Renault Traffic van from Devon to Gloucestershire to visit her parents for an anniversary celebration.

Mrs Craker told the jury: 'I remember thinking "it is a lovely evening", it was quiet, it was the perfect time to travel.'

Mrs Craker, who was driving with her young son and husband, said the vehicle hit a patch of white mist as it entered the M5 at junction 25.

She said the fog was not severe enough to warrant braking and she simply took her foot off the accelerator to pass through it.

'The fog got slowly thicker but it was still white,' Mrs Craker said.

'Then the car went into dark fog or dark smoke but I could still see red lights (of the car in front).

'It got thicker. I could just see the lights. Then they didn’t go anywhere, they just went out. I braked.

'We didn’t see anyone, we just hit whatever was in front of us.

'We got hit almost immediately, two seconds later, by something behind us after the airbags had gone off.

Her husband, Matthew Craker, added: 'It was literally like someone had thrown a bag over my head.

'It was clear, then it was definite fog, then it was a total blackout within a period of less than 30 seconds.'

The motorists said the smoke cleared relatively quickly after the collisions.

The trial continues.
