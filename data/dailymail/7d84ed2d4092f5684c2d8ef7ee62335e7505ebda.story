Abercrombie and Fitch CEO Mike Jeffries may want to reconsider his plan to not market the company's threads to plus-sized patrons - because it seems the A and F brand could use all the business it can get.

The company announced Friday its first quarter earnings, which fell drastically short of Wall Street's expectations - according to the company, its first-quarter sales in the U.S. fell by 17 percent, which many are crediting to offensive comments made by Jeffries in a 2006 interview that recently resurfaced.

'Cool kids': Abercrombie and Fitch CEO Mike Jeffries said in 2006 that a lot of people 'don't belong' in the retailer's clothes - they're only for 'cool kids'

“In every school there are the cool and popular kids, and then there are the not-so-cool kids,” Jeffries said in a 2006 Salon article. “Candidly, we go after the cool kids. We go after the attractive all-American kid with a great attitude and a lot of friends. A lot of people don’t belong [in our clothes], and they can’t belong. Are we exclusionary? Absolutely.”

The comments re-emerged - nearly six years later - in a Business Insider blog post explaining how Abercrombie and Fitch doesn't offer plu-sized clothes for women, and the exclusionary nature of Jeffries' comments has put the retailer in the cross-hairs of equality and anti-bullying groups.

Over the last several weeks, protesters have been expressing their outrage over Jeffries' comments at Abercrombie and Fitch stores all over the country, as well as at the company's corporate headquarters in New Albany, Ohio.

There currently is a Change.org petition circulating calling on Abercrombie and Fitch to 'stop telling teens they aren't beautiful; make clothes for teens of all sizes.' It currently has 72,455 signatures.

'FitchTheHomeless': Greg Karber protests Abercrombie's 'exclusionary' practices by handing out the company's clothes to homeless people

In one of the more creative demonstrations, a California man named Greg Karber started a campaign called 'FitchTheHomeless,' which consists of him handing out Abercrombie and Fitch clothing to homeless people. His campaign has been both praised and criticized, with critics saying it suggests that homeless people are inherently 'uncool and unattractive as it gets.'

Since the uproar over his comments began, Jeffries has made multiple apologies that many have considered half-hearted.

'We want to reiterate that we sincerely regret and apologize for any offense caused by comments we have made in the past which are contrary to these values." one apology says in part.

'Plus sized': Mike Jeffries would be appalled

In regards to his company's disappointing financial numbers, Jeffries claims in a statement to investors that 'the first quarter proved to be more difficult than expected on the 
top-line due to more significant inventory shortage issues than 
anticipated, added to by external pressures.'

Abercrombie and Fitch's stock prices closed today down $4.35 to $50.02. In comparison, stock prices today for Aeropostale Inc. and Gap Inc. - two of Abercrombie and Fitch's biggest competitors - were down $1.72 and $.72, respectively.
