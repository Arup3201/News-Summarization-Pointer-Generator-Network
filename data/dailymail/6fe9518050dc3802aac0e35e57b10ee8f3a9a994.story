A photographer today spoke of his anger after Wikipedia refused to remove his famous picture of a monkey taking a selfie - claiming he cannot own the copyright because the animal took it.

David Slater, from Coleford, Gloucestershire, was 
taking photos of crested black macaques on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi when the animals began to investigate his equipment.

One of the endangered monkeys then hijacked his camera, before snapping hundreds of pictures.

Row: Wikipedia has refused a photographer's requests to remove this picture (left) of a monkey taking a selfie - claiming he cannot own the copyright because the animal took it. Right, the macaque takes another selfie

Although many of these were blurry, there were also a number of stunning images, including a selfie of the grinning macaque which made headlines across the world.

But now, Mr Slater is planning to take legal action against U.S.-based Wikimedia, which owns Wikipedia, after the company used the photo on its site without permission.

Despite repeated complaints, the firm has refused to take the image down - and even offers a link for users to download the original file for free - because it claims Mr Slater does not own the copyright.

A message on its site states: 'This file is in the public domain because as the 
work of a non-human animal, it has no human author in whom copyright is 
vested.'

Explanation: U.S.-based Wikimedia, which owns Wikipedia, states on its site: 'This file is in the public domain because as the work of a non-human animal, it has no human author in whom copyright is vested'

Today, Mr Slater said Wikimedia’s decision to include his image
 in its database had affected his livelihood and resulted in a 
loss of earnings.

'It’s all based on a technicality. I own the photo but because 
the monkey pressed the trigger and took the photo, they’re claiming the 
monkey owns the copyright,' he said.

'There’s
 a lot more to copyright than who pushes the trigger on the camera. I 
set up the shot, I was behind all the components in taking that image.

'The
 problem is they’re telling people it’s free to use because it’s in the 
public domain, they even have a link for people to download the 
high-res, so they’re actively encouraging people to use it however they 
like.'

Available to download: The famous monkey selfie is accessible on the Wikimedia Commons site (pictured), which features a collection of 22,302,592 images and video files that are free to use by anyone online

Mr Slater, whose encounter with the macaques happened in 2011, could sue the company for statutory damages of up to $30,000 (£17,824).

'I’ve lost tens-of-thousands of pounds and I have every right to sue them for a loss of earnings,' he said.

'I’ve contacted a lawyer in the U.S. who is willing to take on the case they’re just waiting for my go ahead.

'Nothing
 gives Wikimedia the right to decide who owns the copyright of the image
 and give people permission to use it for free, no court has decided 
that.

Trapped: In this photo taken by Mr Slater during his trip, a macaque is trapped in a snare. It was then rescued

'They don’t know the 
story behind the image. They are basing their decision on stories they 
have gleaned from the press they have made no attempt to find out the 
facts.'

The selfie of the macaque is accessible on the Wikimedia Commons site, which features a
 collection of 22,302,592 images and video files that are free to use by
 anyone online.

It has also previously appeared on websites, newspapers, magazines and television shows around the world.

At the height of its fame, Mr Slater said of the macaques: 'They were quite 
mischievous jumping all over my equipment, and it looked like they were 
already posing for the camera when one hit the button.

'The
 sound got his attention and he kept pressing it. At first it scared the
 rest of them away but they soon came back - it was amazing to watch.

'He
 must have taken hundreds of pictures by the time I got my camera back, 
but not very many were in focus. He obviously hadn’t worked that out 
yet.'

Wikimedia Commons declined to comment.
