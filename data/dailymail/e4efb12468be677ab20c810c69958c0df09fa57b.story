He's made pizza, steak, slow-cooked lamb and bruschetta, and while they may not seem the most impressive of dishes to cook, this particular chef isn't of the human species.  

These meals form the recipe repertoire of Chef Crusoe, a five-year-old mini black and tan Dachshund.

The food-loving dog lives in Ottawa, Canada with his owners Ryan and Lauren Beauchesne, who describe him as a natural cook.

Paws for thought!: Crusoe the celebrity dachshund gets ready to prepare his slow-cooked lamb

The tidy dog starts his kitchen prep by chopping shallots and garlic  

The adorable dachshund is quite the celebrity, with over 100,000 followers on his Facebook page and his very own award-winning blog. 

The five-year-old chef has so far rustled up pizza, steak and even slow cooked lamb, and now the video of his creating a delicious bruschetta has gone viral.

'He's a bundle of personality wrapped into one little dog, and even though we've given him a 'voice' and he plays many different characters - Chef Crusoe, Captain Crusoe and Batdog. We like to think that everything we post somehow captures a bit of his amazing personality,' Mr Beauchesne said.

He shot to fame after his owners posted a video of him cooking. 

Last December the canine chef signed a book deal and even has a host of merchandise available online, including mugs, T-shirts, bumper stickers and even a calendar that can be 'autographed'.

'Crusoe's recent video showing him making bruschetta, with the enchanting Italian voice of Gino D'Acampo (Mum's crush) is probably our favourite production so far.'

Crusoe patiently waits for his steak to cook. He particularly enjoys making Italian food 

Mr Beauchesne explains that Crusoe's first recipe was carrot cupcakes, which the thoughtful pooch made on Valentine's Day for a special lady.

'Since then he's made pizza, steak and sweet potatoes, slow-cooked lamb, and now as part of his Italian series - 'bruschetta', as we get ready to take Crusoe to Italy this May!'

Mr Beauchesne added that Crusoe will continue with his Italian series cooking videos and maybe even create some while he is in Italy.

The couple who are originally from Quebec got Crusoe when he was just a small puppy and have raised him ever since.

Mr Beauchesne explained that Crusoe enjoys cooking anything that involves a lot of butter, cheese, meat or dairy.

'So his taste is quite diverse. As you can see though, he's very well behaved when working with food! He won't gobble it up until it's finished and served.

'I couldn't have asked for a better dog. We always make the photo shoots fun and he's a great sport. He's always been very calm and cooperative, and just a natural in front of the camera.

'He's like a son to us. It's rare that we're ever not together with him.'
