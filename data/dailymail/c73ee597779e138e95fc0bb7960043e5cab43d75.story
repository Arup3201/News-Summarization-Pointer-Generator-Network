A mother who tricked Seattle Children's doctors into operating unnecessarily on her young daughter will be allowed to get mental health help and avoid jail.

Carmen Boyce, 35, of Kenmore, Washington, went so far as to force one young daughter to throw up when doctors weren't looking in an effort to convince them that the little girl couldn't keep food down, authorities say.

Ms Boyce will not be jailed as long as she sticks with her mental health treatment and abides by the terms of the no-contact order and avoids new trouble with the law. 

But she will likely be ordered to pay for counseling for her daughters.

The Washington state mother was convicted of battery after she claimed for years that her daughters were suffering from severe health problems and even convinced doctors to perform unnecessary surgery, prosecutors said.

Carmen Boyce, 35, has now lost custody of both of her children after prosecutors accused her of forcing them to endure unnecessary medical treatments

After repeated trips to Seattle Children's Hospital over claims that her oldest daughter wasn't eating, Ms Boyce insisted that surgeons insert a feeding tube into her stomach through an invasive procedure called ercutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, according to court documents. 

Doctors at Children's Hospital claim they were convinced Boyce's pleas were truthful and went ahead with the procedure on the girl, who was three years old at the time. 

However, prosecutors claim that both of Boyce's daughters were perfectly healthy all along - except for their mothers' meddling. When the girls, now age four and six, were removed from Boyce's custody, they exhibited no health problems at all.

Boyce has furiously fought the charges, hiring a top Seattle criminal defense attorney who battled the case for nearly two years.

On Tuesday, she pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor fourth-degree domestic assault - but admitted no wrongdoing, saying only that prosecutors likely had enough evidence to win a jury conviction. 

Boyce pleaded guilty, but refused to admit wrongdoing. She has avoided jail

She will avoid jail, but must undergo psychiatric treatment. Prosecutors also recommended that she have no unsupervised contact with either of her daughters. 

Prosecutors had charged Boyce with second-degree assault of a child - a felony that would likely have carried a three-year prison term for Boyce - as well as fourth-degree assault.  

In motions filed by her attorney, David Allen, Boyce argued that the behavior that led to her arrest in May 2013 was the result of a misunderstanding by doctors and a witness.

Both Boyce and Allen declined to comment for this story.

She was arrested after a parent of another patient at Children's Hospital, who happens to be a nurse, reported to hospital staffer the Boyce appeared to induce vomiting in her young daughter during a visit, authorities say. 

Boyce had taken the girl to the hospital and told doctors that she wasn't eating and could not keep food down.  

According to prosecutors, the witness saw Boyce throw her daughter over her knee and tickle her until she lost control and vomited.
