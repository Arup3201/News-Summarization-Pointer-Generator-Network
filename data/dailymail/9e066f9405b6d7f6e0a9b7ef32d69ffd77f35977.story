Dredging equipment has finally been installed on the Somerset Levels - three months after the heaviest January rainfall in 250 years forced thousands of people to flee their homes.

Thanks to enormous water pumps from the Netherlands removing millions of tonnes of water from the land, large sections of the Somerset Levels are now dry, allowing for long-awaited dredging to begin on silt-laden rivers in the area.

The dredging is part of a £5.8million plan to clear a five mile stretch of the nearby Tone and Parrett rivers, with the project due to get underway on Monday - just a day before a deadline imposed by David Cameron in the middle of February.

At last: Thanks to enormous water pumps from the Netherlands removing millions of tonnes of water from the land, large sections of the Somerset Levels are now dry, allowing for long-awaited dredging to begin on silt-laden rivers in the area

Plans: The dredging project will see tonnes of sediment removed from the rivers Tone and Parrett. The material has been building up since clearing stopped 18 years ago

Before: This photograph was taken on the Somerset Levels in January and shows huge expanses of land under several feet of water

And after: The same area seen three months later. Millions of tonnes of water have been removed by enormous water pumps brought over from the Netherlands

The dredging project will see engineers remove tonnes of sediment from the rivers, which has built up since clearing stopped 18 years ago.

It is hoped removing the sediment will increase the capacity of the rivers, which have been operating at just 60 per cent in places, and reduce the risk of them overflowing during the next period of heavy rainfall.

The dredging comes as farmers who evacuated the area in January finally started to move their cattle back on to rain-damaged fields.

The initial dredging is just the start of a £100million plan which was put together by locals in the hope of ensuring their homes are never flooded again.

How it was: Farmland and thousands of homes were evacuated on the Somerset Levels as a result of the heaviest January rainfall in 250 years

New look: The same area three months later. The dredging comes as farmers who evacuated the area finally start to move their cattle back on to rain-damaged fields

Underway: The dredging will start at a crucial point of the River Tone, where two and a half miles will be cleared before workmen move on to the River Parrett

Speaking ahead of the dredging, Sedgemoor District Council chief executive Kerry Rickards said: 'When the waters recede and the media spotlight moves on to something else, it's very easy to get moved on to the next challenge.'

'However we will keep chasing for money to prevent prolonged flooding. We will not stand by and run the risk of more floods when we have spells of prolonged rain.'

In February Prime Minister David Cameron promised that work to clear the river beds would begin by the end of March.

Work will start at a crucial point of the River Tone, where two and a half miles will be cleared before workmen move on to an equal stretch of the Parrett.

The full 20-year dredging plan includes improvements to the upper river areas that drains into the Levels, and a water gate across the Parrett near Bridgwater

This Somerset Levels home become a symbol of the January floods when its owner - builder Sam Notaro - refused to abandon the property despite it being completely surrounded by water. He created makeshift defences from building material he had on site

Dubbed King Canute's castle, the property managed to escape the extensive flooding thanks to a seven-foot high mud dam. This is how the four-bedroom home in Moorland, Somerset looks today

In February David Cameron promised that work to clear the river beds would begin by the end of March. It will finally get underway on Monday - just one day before the Prime Minister's deadline

The full 20-year plan includes improvements to the upper river areas that drains into the Levels, and a water gate across the Parrett near Bridgwater to prevent tidal surges.

The work begins as farmers start to rebuild their livelihoods which were decimated by the waters.

Farmer James Winslade, 40, this week returned some of his 550 cows to his farm in West Yeo, Bridgwater.

They had been scattered all over Somerset after all 790 acres of his farm went underwater and he lost 10,800 bales of hay and straw, and countless farm machines.

He said: 'It will be a relief to get them back, it will make life so much easier. i can get some feed in and I won't have to take it back and forth.'

The rivers Tone and Parrett can now be cleared of sediment, which has dramatically reduced their capacity

Both rivers had been operating at 60 per cent - causing regular flooding in and around the Somerset Levels

The dredging is scheduled to begin on Monday - just one day before a David Cameron-imposed deadline
