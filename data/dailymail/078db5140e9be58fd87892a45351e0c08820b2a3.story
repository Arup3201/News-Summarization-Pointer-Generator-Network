Cleared: Dominique Strauss-Khan has had charges of gang rape dropped after the alleged victim changed her testimony

Shamed former IMF chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn has escaped charges of gang rape after a vice girl told police they were playing 'sex games'.

The alleged victim had changed her story to tell police that the group sex with prostitutes at an orgy in Washington DC was 'consensual', prosecutors have revealed.

Strauss-Kahn, 64, had faced 20 years in prison over the claims by the prostitute named Marion that he used force against her and other girls during the sex session in December 2010.

The 800 pounds-a-night hooker had told police in initial interviews last year: 'He gripped my hands, he pulled my hair, he hurt me.'

She insisted he had tried to subject her to degrading acts, adding: 'I refused, telling him no. I said firmly and loudly several times that I did not want that.' 

But judicial officials said today that the woman had now retracted her statement.

A judicial source added: 'She has retracted her deposition in a letter sent to judicial police.

'She said that in fact the sex was consensual and that the group was playing sexual games.

'The investigators, who believe they have gone as far as they can with their inquiries, have sent the file back to the prosecutors and a shelving of the inquiry will follow.'

But the man once tipped as a future president of France still stands accused of conspiring with pimps to procure girls for sex parties around the world.

He and four other men are also charged with knowing fraudulently obtained money was being paid to the vice girls by a prostitution racket based in Lille, northern France.

Among those under investigation are former Lille police chief Jean-Christophe Lagarde and Lille businessmen David Roquet and Fabrice Paszkowski.

Strauss-Kahn was accused of trying to rape French writer Tristane Banon in 2003. The allegations were later dropped

Strauss-Kahn has been embroiled in a catalogue of sex scandals since he was arrested for trying to rape a New York hotel chambermaid in May last year.

After being held in New York's notorious Ryker's Island prison, criminal charges were dropped and he returned to France only to face similar accusations of sexually abusing a young French writer.

When those allegations were also dropped, he was then confronted with more claims he used hookers supplied by the Lille vice network.

He has admitted to attending many 'swingers parties' but insisted the young women were not prostitutes and he often had sex with 'willing girls' in their 20s.

His lawyer Richard Malka has described DSK as a 'simple swinger' who has committed nothing more than 'crimes of lust'.

Mr Malka said his client would now do everything in his power to have the charges brought by two judges in Lille dismissed.

Strauss-Kahn is now formally under 'judicial control' on £85,000 bail until judges decide whether to send him to stand trial.

It also emerged this week that Strauss-Kahn may be hired by Greece to help rescue the bankrupt nation's collapsing economy.

The disgraced French economist jetted to Athens to meet with government ministers last week, it was claimed.

France's Europe1 radio station said: 'The Greek media is convinced he has been hired as a debt advisor.

'As the former head of the International Monetary Fund, he certainly has the qualifications.

'His financial wizardry has never been in doubt, despite the problems in his private life.'
