Casey Anthony could be at risk of 'disappearing' if the defamation cases against her continue, according to her lawyers.

The 27-year-old from Florida has been accused of slandering two people by implicating them in the death of her daughter Caylee, whom she was cleared of murdering.

But she is seeking to have their lawsuits dropped, claiming she does not have enough money to pay damages.

At risk: Casey Anthony could disappear if she is forced to defend against lawsuits, according to her attorneys

Anthony is being sued by Roy Kronk, the workman who found Caylee's body after the two-year-old had been missing for six months, who says he has been accused of wrongdoing over the toddler's death.

She also faces a suit from Zenaida Gonzalez, a woman with the same name as a fictional nanny who Anthony originally claimed had kidnapped Caylee.

However, both cases were paused in January when Anthony filed for bankruptcy.

Her lawyers are now seeking to have the suits dismissed, filing papers in Orange County Circuit Court claiming that Anthony could go into hiding as a result of her legal struggles, according to the Orlando Sentinel.

Daughter: Anthony was acquitted of murdering two-year-old Caylee, who went missing for six months

'She will either defend the cases or be forced to default because she has no money,' they wrote. 'She will be lampooned in the press. The death threats will again increase.

'She will be forced to find new accommodations, or just simply disappear and say it is not worth the fight anymore.'

Anthony, who was widely vilified at the time of her trial for murder, has barely been seen in public since being acquitted of killing her daughter.

She claims to be nearly $800,000 in debt thanks to heavy legal fees, and a bankruptcy trustee has sought to sell off the rights to her life story in order to pay her bills.

Although Anthony was found not guilty of murder in 2011, she was convicted of lying to police after it emerged that she had made up her explanation of why Caylee was missing.

Last month, the trial judge said that he was shocked by Anthony's acquittal and claimed that there was enough evidence to convict her of killing her daughter.
