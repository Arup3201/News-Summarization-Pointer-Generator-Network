A seven-year-old boy with learning difficulties has been threatened with deportation despite the fact his mother has British citizenship.

The Home Office has written to Jamie Leung, who is Canadian by birth, warning him he could be 'forcibly removed' from the UK.

He has lived in Crossens, Southport, with his mother Sara, since June last year.

His mother, who has dual British and Canadian citizenship, said she did not think she would need a visa for Jamie for her home country just because he is Canadian by birth.

She has now said she is 'horrified, angry and upset' at the actions of the Home Office after they sent a letter warning Jamie he could be deported.

Ms Leung moved to Germany in 2007 where she met her partner Heiko Dietz when Jamie was a toddler.

Upon arriving in the UK from Geramny in 2012, Ms Leung was told her son could not enter the UK legally.

Jamie was issued with a six-month visitor visa and Ms Leung was told to resolve the issue with the Home Office.

But she said she could not afford about £1,000 for a special visa for her son.

Acting on advice Ms Leung and her German-born fiancé Mr Dietz decided he should apply for a residency card and then have Jamie registered as his dependent.

But she said the Home Office rejected the application and her young son could now be forcibly removed from the country.

In its letter the Home Office said it did not receive the correct evidence to support the application.

It goes on to say: 'As you appear to have no alternative basis of stay in the United Kingdom you should now make arrangements to leave.

'If you fail to do so voluntarily your departure may be enforced.'

Ms Leung's other children, Quinn, three, and Elisha, 11 months, are not affected by the ruling.

Ms Leung said: 'They have Jamie’s birth certificate and passport. I have two other European-born children here, I can’t just pick up and leave, it is ridiculous.

'I have been told that Jamie should have a visa, this had just never occurred to me.

'No one ever asked me any questions about his passport when we went to other European countries.

'Then to come to one of my home countries, I would never have considered it.'

The letter from the Home Office landed at the family’s home on Ms Leung's birthday on Saturday.

She said she is yet to explain to Jamie what is happening.

'I have not attempted to tell him. I am worried about his mental state, I do not want to upset him. What mother would want to explain to their child that their government wants them out?'

Ms Leung said it was 'particularly stressful' making the application while pregnant with her third child.

She said: 'During the time of all of this, trying to communication with the UK Border Agency, I was also heavily pregnant with my daughter, so it was particularly stressful.'

Ms Leung said they were due to appeal the Home Office's decision.

The family’s plea to keep Jamie in the UK has been backed by Southport MP Dr John Pugh.

He said: 'You would have thought that the immigration department had better things to do than harass a seven-year-old child.

'This is one of those situations which the rules and regulations clearly do not properly cater for.

'They wouldn’t even know which country to send him to. So it is farcical to carry on like this.

'There is no court in the land that is going to split up a mother from her child. The whole thing is ludicrous bureaucracy.'

A Home Office spokesman said: 'All applications are considered on their individual merits and in line with the EU rules.

'The onus is on the individual to provide the necessary evidence to support their application.'
