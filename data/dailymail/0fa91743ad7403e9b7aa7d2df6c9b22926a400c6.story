The battle to turn Britain around is ‘not even close to being over’, George Osborne warned today as he vowed to stick to his economic plan.

The Chancellor told the Tory party conference that family finances would not improve overnight as he rejected Labour’s plan to ‘fix prices and confiscate wealth’.

Unveiling new welfare reforms, Mr Osborne set out a new commitment to cutting Britain’s debts and promised to freeze fuel duty until 2015.

Warning: George Osborne told the Tory party conference that the recovery was still at risk and it would be some time before incomes started rising

Chancellor George Osborne set out a range of policies in his speech to Conservative delegates including:

Mr Osborne said he could not rule out 
future tax rises, but said he thought it was possible to balance the 
nation’s books through spending cuts and reining in welfare spending.

He
unveiled plans to strip benefits from the long-term jobless unless they
work full time picking up litter, removing graffiti or preparing meals 
for the elderly.

The US-style ‘work for the dole’ programme will start within six months and affect 200,000 welfare claimants.

And
he promised help to motorists with the cost of living. Mr Osborne said:
'Provided we can find the savings to pay for it, I want to freeze fuel 
duty for the rest of this Parliament.

'Conservatives
don't just talk about being on the side of hard-working people. We show
it day in day out in the policies we deliver.'

Mr
Osborne also unveiled his ambition to ensure that a future Conservative
Government will run a surplus in good times as well as bad.

'It
should be obvious to anyone that in the years running up to the crash 
this country should have been running a budget surplus,' he said.

'That’s what we mean when we say they didn’t fix the roof when the sun was shining. Let us never make that same mistake again.'

He said the plan would allow Tories to
deliver tax cuts and increased infrastructure investment to ensure that
the UK is prepared for any future economic crash.

Mr
Osborne told delegates: ‘Our plan is working. We held our nerve in the 
face of huge pressure. Now Britain is turning a corner.

‘That
is due to the resolve and the sacrifice of the people of this country. 
For that support we owe the British people a huge heartfelt thank you. 
Thanks to you Britain is on the right track.’

Welfare: Mr Osborne accused Labour of allowing people to linger on benefits for years - with no questions asked

Karren Brady hailed Chancellor George Osborne 
as 'the right man with the right plan' and launched an attack on Labour 
who she said 'all but bankrupted the country'.

The football boss and Apprentice star 
was unveiled as the Conservative’s new business tsar, fuelling 
speculation she will launch a political career.

Speaking
at the Tory conference in Manchester, the West Ham vice-chairman spoke 
of the difficulties of being the first woman ‘to break into a very male 
dominated industry’ – including being asked what her ‘vital statistics’ 
were.

She said: 'David Cameron and George Osborne held their nerve and stuck 
to the plan and I hope you can see how right they were - we are now 
starting to recover, we are turning a corner.'

The 44-year-old, who has spoken of her
desire to ‘get involved’ in running the country, was chosen to 
introduce the Chancellor’s keynote conference speech.

He went on: ‘We have to deal with our debts and see our plan through. And yes, if the recovery is sustained then families will start to feel better off.

‘Because what matters most for living standards are jobs, and low mortgage rates, and lower taxes.

‘But family finances will not be transformed overnight. Because Britain was made much poorer by the crash.

‘That is what happens when you get a catastrophic failure of economic policy of the kind we saw five years ago the result of a decade of Labour failure when bust follows boom when banks get bailed out and when government budgets spiral out of control.’

He added: ‘This battle to turn around Britain it is not even close to being over. And we are going to finish what we have started. There can be no recovery for all if there is no recovery at all.’

He accused Labour of allowing people to linger on benefits for years – with no questions asked – while letting uncontrolled numbers of migrants fill low-paid jobs.

The ‘Help to Work’ scheme – quickly dubbed ‘Made to Work’ – is likely to face furious opposition from left-wing activists and charities.

But Mr Osborne told Tory delegates:
‘For the first time, all long-term unemployed people who are capable of
work will be required to do something in return for their benefits to 
help them find work.

‘They will do useful work to put 
something back into their community – making meals for the elderly, 
clearing up litter, working for a local charity. Others will be made to 
attend the job centre every working day.

‘And for those with underlying problems, like drug addiction and illiteracy, there will be an intensive regime of help. No one will be ignored or left without help. But no one will get something for nothing.’

The Liberal Democrats have agreed that the scheme, which is larger than expected, should begin next April – confirming welfare as a major election issue.

Around 200,000 jobseeker’s allowance claimants will be affected each year.

Mr Osborne used his speech to the conference to warn that ‘many risks remain’ to the economic recovery.

He argued that what matters most for 
living standards are ‘jobs, and low mortgage rates, and lower taxes’ – 
an implied rebuke to Labour leader Ed Miliband’s proposal to use 
1970s-style laws to fix energy prices.

He argued that it is crucial 
for Britain’s future economic health that the long-term unemployed no 
longer have ‘a life on the dole’.

The
£300million Help to Work scheme will be 
funded from spending cuts and savings elsewhere, to be detailed in the 
autumn statement.

Claimants put on community work 
placements will have to do 30 hours a week for six months, plus ten 
hours of job search activity a week, and show they are doing ‘everything
they can’ to find paid work.

Placements will have to be of wider benefit to the community as well as the individual claimant.

Those
who break the rules will lose four weeks of benefits for their first 
breach of the rules, and a quarter of a year’s worth for any second 
offence.

Mr Osborne said: ‘By the time 
Labour left office, five million people were on out-of-work benefits.

'What
a waste of life and talent. A generation of people recycled through the
job centres – collecting their dole cheques year in year out, and no 
one seemed to notice.

'For
an open-door immigration policy meant those running the economy didn’t 
care: there was always a ready supply of low-skilled labour from abroad.
Well, never again.’

The Chancellor argued that, under 
Labour’s welfare system, people were better off on benefits than in work
and nothing was asked for in return for handouts.

But Rachel Reeves, Labour’s Treasury spokesman, said: ‘It’s taken three wasted years of rising long-term unemployment and a failed Work Programme to come up with this new scheme.

‘But this policy is not as ambitious as Labour’s compulsory jobs guarantee, which would ensure there is a paid job for every young person out of work for over 12 months and every adult unemployed for more than two years.

‘With Labour’s plans we would work with employers to ensure there are jobs for young people and the long-term unemployed – which they would have to take up or lose benefits.

'Under the Tory scheme people would still be allowed to languish on the dole for years on end without having a proper job.’
