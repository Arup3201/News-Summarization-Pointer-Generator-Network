When Radamel Falcao left for Manchester in such a dreadful hurry this week, it was almost enough to make the residents of Monaco choke on their lobster risotto, drop their flute of fizz, rip the Gucci shades from their eyes and demand answers.

Almost, but not quite. Monaco is a strange place. For many locals it will have passed without notice that the rest of European football has turned with intrigue towards the principality and events at the club owned by Dmitry Rybolovlev.

Was it a cash-flow issue that forced the Russian oligarch to cool on his investment and sell star assets Falcao and James Rodriguez as they prepared for a return to the Champions League for the first time in nearly a decade? That would be understandable as he fights an astonishing divorce settlement of £2.7billion.

Or was he simply getting bored? Was it a whim? Had he taken offence that his desire for full citizenship has yet to be granted? Was it something more sinister? Was Monte Carlo going bust?

Monaco's manager Leonardo Jardim quietly fumed. This was not what the brochure had promised when he replaced Claudio Ranieri in June. Fans demanded refunds on shirts and season tickets bought before the exodus of players and change of recruitment policy.

Monaco reneged on a pre-contract deal to sign Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes and took Maarten Stekelenburg on loan from Fulham instead. Months after reports of an audacious plot to sign Cristiano Ronaldo, the targets look very different.

Joao Moutinho, who arrived with James from Porto last year in a £60million package, was rumoured to have stormed out of the training ground when it became clear Falcao was off to Manchester United, irrespective of the fact the Colombian's commitment has been in question since his return from serious injury.

Elsewhere, around France, there was a sigh of disappointment that the only true challengers to unfeasibly rich champions Paris Saint-Germain had chosen to scale back and leave Ligue 1 hopelessly uncompetitive.

Expensive: Dmitri Rybolovley is going through an eye-watering £2.7m divorce with wife Elena

Jardim's team have four points from four games and their quest for a first French title since 2000 appears fanciful.

Loyal supporters feel betrayed and angry, but these feelings will not reverberate in the streets as they might if this script had unfolded down the coast in Marseille.

Resident millionaires — tennis players, racing drivers, actors, music stars and the like — have higher profiles than the footballers in a town busily preparing for its annual yacht show.

What do they care if Falcao deserts them to rub shoulders with skinny wannabes from Coronation Street and Hollyoaks or fading rebels from the Happy Mondays?

AS Monaco has always been quite unique, a football club set in a tax haven of 36,000 people, the world's second smallest independent state, participating in the French league before crowds averaging 11,000 on a poor pitch built on a car park.

The appeal has never been its passion for football. 'I was young and I enjoyed it for a while,' said former England striker Mark Hateley, who spent three years there, after moving from AC Milan in 1987.

'It was completely different from the intensity of Milan. I could walk in the streets with my kids and there was no fuss. We were playing good football in a good team under a young Arsene Wenger. We were successful. We won the title and it was a great experience.

'The lifestyle is beautiful, but in the winter we could play in front of two or three thousand. For big players, it's not quite what you want. I left after three years. I needed new challenges. That's the downside. The upside, of course, for the big stars, is that it's tax free.'

Quietly fuming: This is not what new Monaco boss Leonardo Jardim expected when he took over

The principality ruled by the Grimaldi dynasty charges no income tax and its private banking industry has long been the focus of international concern. For five years until 2009, it was on an official blacklist of uncooperative tax havens, but has always denied running a regime tolerant to money laundering.

Rybolovlev was already a resident in December 2011 when he bought 66.67 per cent of the crisis club wallowing near the bottom of Ligue 2, having slumped from its high of the Champions League final in 2004. Head of state Prince Albert II applauded the deal.

'The agreement opens a new page in the history of the football team so dear to the principality,' said the Prince. 'I hope the club can rediscover its former prestige, which made it one of the jewels of Monaco's sporting life.'

Others wondered aloud if this sugar-daddy takeover could work in the absence of a genuine fan-base, with UEFA's Financial Fair Play (FFP) rules swinging into action. Would it soar like Chelsea, or crash like the failed experiment at Anzhi Makhachkala?

Rybolovlev's personal fortune built on potash offered its own insurance. It was estimated by Forbes this year at £5.3bn and he remains seriously rich, even after his costly divorce.

Within 18 months of the takeover Monaco were back in the top flight and assembling a formidable squad. They finished runners-up behind PSG last season, but the plans were already starting to unravel.

After Falcao's exit on Monday, the club's vice-president Vadim Vasilyev stressed it had never been the plan to continue last year's spree, but he admitted three factors had forced the Russians to 'edit the project'.

No cashing in: Revenue did not explode at Monaco after the signings of Falcao and Rodriguez

Firstly, he said, there was FFP and the penalties imposed by UEFA on Manchester City and PSG for failing to comply.

Then, there was the £41.5m paid to the French league to settle a dispute and allow AS Monaco to continue trading from their tax-free state while competing against clubs bound by France's taxation laws. 'They have always been a thorn in French football,' said Hateley.

Rival clubs finally demanded action when France proposed a 75 per cent top-rate of income tax and a compromise was found, which included this one-off payment by Monaco. Initially the principality was going to pay half, but Rybolovlev has ended up footing the bill.

Thirdly, revenue did not explode as hoped after big names such as Falcao, James, Moutinho, Jeremy Toulalan, Ricardo Carvalho and Eric Abidal arrived. 

'We thought that with the stars we signed, sponsors would come,' said Vasilyev, in an interview with L'Equipe. 'We have realised that will take time.'

Rybolovlev insists his divorce will not influence club policy. A Swiss court ordered him to pay £2.7bn, plus property in Switzerland worth £88.5m, to wife Elena after more than 20 years of marriage. Her lawyer called it 'the most expensive divorce in history,' although how much of the figure she actually receives is open to question. 

He has challenged the ruling and a complicated trust structure transfering assets to the couple's two daughters were not part of the ruling and the actual settlement is set to be the subject to ongoing legal action for many years. 

Some suspect this has influenced his club policy, while others think he has taken offence because his rescue act at AS Monaco has not been rewarded with the ultimate social upgrade from his carte de sejour — a 10-year residency pass — to a full Monegasque passport. 

Complicated: The deal to take Joao Moutinho (left) to Monaco was tangled up in third-party ownership

Only the Prince can grant full citizenship and very few of these passports exist (an estimated 6,000 in 2009). It is a matter of acceptance and his relationship with the royal family is thought to be crumbling.

Prince Albert left early as Monaco lost their opening game of the season at home to Lorient — an act widely interpreted as a protest at Rybolovlev's failure to reinvest profits from James's £71m sale back into the team.

It is not quite so simple. The deals to bring Falcao, James and Moutinho to the Stade Louis II were entangled with third-party ownership and as such the profits were not all for the club.

Even so, there is no hint Rybolovlev is about to quit. He has just bought a new £180m apartment overlooking the harbour, the latest addition to a property empire that includes a £56m pad in Central Park - bought by his daughter Ekaterina Rybolovleva - that broke New York real estate records.

'Who knows the future?' said Vasilyev in L'Equipe, but he insisted the owner will be back in his seat in the stands for the Champions League opener against Bayer Leverkusen on September 16, and remained ambitious and committed to an 'intelligent long-term project' albeit one that is slightly 'less glorious' than before. 

Vasilyev told the Daily Mail: 'Since becoming President of AS Monaco in 2011, Mr Rybolovlev has overseen the club's promotion to Ligue 1 and qualification for the Champions League – both achieved at the first attempt. He remains 100 percent committed to the AS Monaco project. 

'In light of events over the past year that could not have been foreseen, some of the tactics and the timeframe for the project have been amended. But the ultimate goal remains exactly the same: to develop AS Monaco into a competitive European club and one of the world's elite sporting brands.'
