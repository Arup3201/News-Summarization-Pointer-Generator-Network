A historical villa in Tuscany, which was once the residence of the Bulgari jewellery dynasty, has been sold for £4.7million.

Villa Godilonda, in Castiglioncello on the Tuscan coast, was at one time the most beautiful venue in the region, and frequented by Italian glitterati.

It most recently functioned as a hotel, but had fallen into disrepair after closing in 2007.

Changing hands: A luxury villa famous for  being the summer residence of the Bulgari family has  sold for £4.7m

New life: The beautiful property in Castiglioncello on the Tuscan coast is to be transformed into a luxury hotel

The property was purchased by an unidentified Eastern European businessman, Lionard Luxury Real Estate, which negotiated the sale, confirmed.

Renovation work will begin shortly, with plans to restore the villa to its former glory and create a luxury hotel.

Built at the end of the 19th century, Villa Godilonda was bought by the American Carter family in 1924, and after the war became the summer residence of the Bulgari family.

In the 1980s the property was transformed into a hotel, where famous Italian stars including Marcello Mastroianni, Vittorio Gassman and Walter Chiari were guests. It closed in 2007.

History: Villa Godilonda served as a hotel from the Eighties to 2007, but has since fallen into disrepair

Location, location: The property's main villa is 1,700 square metres and sits above its own private beach

It is said that Gabriele D'Annunzio, one of Italy's most important writers, gave it the name Godilonda, from 'godi l'onda' or 'enjoy the waves', after having spent a romantic and passionate night here at the beginning of the twentieth century.

Built on the point of a headland in Castiglioncello, the villa enjoys spectacular views of the sea and its own private beach.

The 1,700 square-metre main villa has eight bedrooms, a winter garden, a spa and 11,000 square-metres of parkland.

The Bulgari family sold their company to LVMH in 2011 for £3.4bn all-share deal, which saw them hand over their 50.4 per cent stake in exchange for three per cent of LVMH.

Luxury: The villa sits on 11,00 square metres of parkland and has panoramic views across the sea

Iconic: The jewellery and luxury goods company was founded in 1884 by Sotirios Voulgaris 

Dynasty: The Bulgari family sold their company to LVMH in 2011 for £3.4 billion all-share deal
