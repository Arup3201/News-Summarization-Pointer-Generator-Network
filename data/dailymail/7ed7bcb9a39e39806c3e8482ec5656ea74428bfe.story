Jaye Derrick, from the University of 
Buffalo's Research Institute on Addictions, describes watching reruns as
providing 'social surrogate restoration.'

In her article published in Social Psychological and Personality Science, Ms Derrick  says that while watching TV is 
not the optimal way to boost your mood – physical exercise and reading 
can have the same effect – it should not be dismissed.

Media use can have unexpected psychological benefits,' she concludes.

'Television, movies and books can be more than leisure activities; in some cases, they fulfill needs, like restoring self-control, that people are reluctant or unable to fulfill through other means.'
