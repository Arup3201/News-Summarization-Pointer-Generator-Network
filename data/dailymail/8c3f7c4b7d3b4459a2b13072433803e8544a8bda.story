A restroom at a Wal-Mart in eastern Indiana has been closed indefinitely after an employee discovered a working meth lab inside.

State police say a Wal-Mart employee alerted police after seeing a man he described as suspicious enter the restroom about 11:30 pm Thursday with a backpack and then leave without it. 

Police were called, and determined that inside the backpack were items that constituted a miniature meth lab, with chemicals used to 'cook' the drug were being mixed in containers.

State police say people who make methamphetamine are leaving 'the deadly explosive chemicals in public places to return later to get the finished product,' rather than risk explosions and contamination at their own homes.

Scene: An employee of the Walmart at 1501 E. 29th St. in Muncie alerted police officers to a backpack that had been left in this restroom, which was being used to mix dangerous chemicals to make methamphetamine 

The incident occurred at the Wal-Mart in Muncie, Indianapolis, late on Thursday night

The discovery of such 'labs' are becoming routine for authorities.

The fastest way to make meth is referred to as 'shake and bake', where the chemicals are mixed in two liter bottles, and later cooked in the oven until it crystallizes.

However mixing the chemicals runs a huge risk of explosion, with the blast of one bottle capable of killing someone. 

The Star Press reports that members of a state police meth suppression team removed the dangerous chemicals.

Delaware County Health Department inspectors closed the restroom and a nearby women's restroom until they could be 'decontaminated' by a professional cleaning company.

An investigation into who left the backpack in the restroom is now under way. 

Brian Nick, director of National Media Relations for Walmart, said the store's surveillance video was being provided to police for that probe.
