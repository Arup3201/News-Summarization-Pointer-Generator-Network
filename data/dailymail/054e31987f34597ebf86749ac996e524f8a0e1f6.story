Pressure on Nick Clegg to quit as Lib Dem leader intensified last night after the party’s wipeout in the European elections.

Following a catastrophic night, which cost him all but one of his MEPs, he was forced to admit he had lost the argument over Europe.

In an emotional interview, in which his eyes appeared bloodshot, the Deputy Prime Minister said being beaten into fifth place by the Greens had been ‘gutting and heartbreaking’.

But Mr Clegg found an unlikely ally this morning - in  Tony Blair. The former Prime Minister praised Mr Clegg's 'courage and leadership' in taking on Ukip. But Mr Blair added that the Lib Dems were still on course to be wiped out in next year's general election.

Bloodshot: In an interview at Lib Dem HQ in London, Mr Clegg admitted it was 'gutting and heartbreaking' to come fifth in the European elections behind Ukip, the Conservatives, Labour and the Green party

Mr Blair's intervention came after the Lib Dem leader was humiliated by Nigel Farage, who publicly credited him with Ukip’s unprecedented victory in this weekend's European elections.

Lib Dem MPs and activists broke cover to insist that Mr Clegg should resign, saying it would be ‘insanity’ to carry on without a change of leadership after such an ‘abysmal’ result.

Leaked polling published by the Guardian suggested the Lib Dem wipeout could be repeated at next year’s General Election, with Mr Clegg even set to lose his own seat.

The concerns over Mr Clegg’s future are now so serious that senior Tories are discussing what it would mean for the future of the Coalition if Mr Clegg was forced to stand down.

On a dramatic political day:

In a catastrophic night, the Lib Dems lost all their seats in every region apart from the South-East as Ukip romped to victory with 24 MEPs and a 28 per cent share of the vote. Labour ended the night with 20 MEPs, the Tories 19 and the Green Party three.

How the nation voted

It led to calls yesterday for Mr Clegg to stand down, with Business Secretary Vince Cable tipped as his possible replacement.

After several hours of silence yesterday, Mr Cable was forced to publicly deny there was an ‘issue’ over leadership.

But at a rally in London, Mr Farage 
said: ‘I would be very surprised if he [Mr Clegg] led the Lib Dems into 
the next General Election.’

He thanked Mr Clegg for challenging him to two TV debates, which the Lib Dem leader was widely judged to have lost badly.

Mr Farage said: ‘Nick Clegg, to whom I am personally extremely grateful, because challenging us to those debates really kicked off the whole European election campaign.’

But the former Prime Minister Tony Blair said Mr Clegg had done the right thing in standing up to Mr Farage. 

He said: 'To be fair to Nick Clegg, I don’t want to damage him by saying this, but over the last few years he’s shown quite a lot of leadership and courage as a leader.

'But the problem the Lib Dems have is nothing to do with Europe. The problem they have is very simple. They fought the 2010 election on a platform significantly to the left of Labour and then ended up in a Conservative government with a platform significantly to the right of Labour.

'If you're someone who voted Lib Dem in 2010 because you liked their total opposition to tuition fees, you're going to be somewhat disappointed, let's say, when the people you vote for end up in a government that triples them. That's the problem the Lib Dems have and there's not much cure for that.'

Former Tory Chancellor Ken Clarke said the Liberal Democrats were in a 'big electoral dilemma' because they were no longer the protest party.

He said: 'I prefer the politics to the psephology. But actually, if you think about the Liberals, firstly they've lost the protest vote - which is a big part of their vote. If you want to protest, you vote UKIP now because [the Liberal Democrats] have joined the Government.

'They lost about 50% of their former supporters who were otherwise on the left, Labour supporters who voted Liberal to try to keep the Conservatives out.

'So the Liberals are on a big electoral dilemma; pro-Europeans probably voted Liberal Democrat at this election but most pro-Europeans didn't vote.'

Nick Clegg felt the true force of public disenchantment with his party in his own back yard. 

In Sheffield, where he stands as an MP, the Liberal Democrats were pushed into fifth place. In nearby Doncaster, it was a similar situation for Ed Miliband. He sits as one of the town’s MPs, but Labour only came second there, behind Ukip.

The Tories face a tough by-election in Newark next week and will be hoping to improve on their standing in the European vote.

Ukip beat them by 10,027 votes to 9,641. But David Cameron fought off the Ukip challenge in West Oxfordshire – which contains his Witney seat. The Tories held Ukip off into second place.

The opinion polls which were leaked were commissioned by a Lib Dem activist and suggest that Mr Clegg will lose in Sheffield Hallam to Labour by 33 points to 23, finishing even behind the Tories.

In the 2010 election, Mr Clegg won over 50 per cent of the vote.

The polling also suggested the Lib Dems will lose Cambridge, Redcar and Wells. 

But a Liberal Democrat spokesman dismissed the poll's findings. He said: 'We have no idea where this polling comes from but it has clearly been commissioned and leaked for political purposes.

'It bears no relation to the result we saw on Thursday night, where Liberal Democrats secured 38.7% of the vote across Sheffield Hallam. Labour managed 23.6%, whilst the Tories came fifth with just 10.7%.'

Mr Clegg, appearing at Lib Dem HQ in London, appealed for his party to hold its nerve until next year’s General Election, insisting ousting him as leader would be even more catastrophic for the party’s prospects.

Looking exhausted, he said: ‘If I thought any of our real dilemmas would be addressed by changing leadership, changing strategy, changing approaches, bailing out now, changing direction, then I wouldn’t hesitate advocating it. Absolutely not.’

Isolated: Mr Clegg after voting in the European elections. Leaked polls suggest he would lose his seat

But 12 Lib Dem MPs were said to be ready to publicly call for Mr Clegg’s head, though some of those on the list denied involvement in a plot. Lib Dem MP John Pugh said he wanted Mr Cable to take over as leader, blaming his party’s ‘abysmal’ showing on voters’ attitude to Mr Clegg.

‘If we carry on as usual we are like the generals at the Somme, because the losses are so horrendous. Given the scale of the losses, to call for business as usual is frankly ludicrous,’ he said.

Former Liberal president Des Wilson said Mr Clegg was ‘politically toxic’ and ‘no longer credible’ and should step down as party leader, while remaining Deputy Prime Minister.

Business Secretary Mr Cable, who is currently in China, said the results were ‘exceptionally disappointing’.

But he added: ‘Nick did a bold thing in standing up to the eurosceptic wave which has engulfed much of continental Europe. We are the only party to have taken that on and he personally deserves tremendous credit for that.

‘There is no leadership issue... Now is not the time for infighting and introspection. The party must hold its nerve.’

There is a small band of ‘Tories for Vince’ in the Cabinet, who believe a change of leader would restore Lib Dem fortunes – which in turn could stop Labour picking up enough disaffected Lib Dem votes to win power.

Senior Tories are understood to believe Mr Clegg is likely to survive the leadership crisis but have discussed for the first time what would happen if he is pushed out.

They expect the Lib Dems would move to a so-called ‘confidence and supply’ arrangement, under which a minority party in a coalition pledges Parliamentary support to the Government in any motion of confidence, or any Bills relating to finance and spending. It would not prevent the minority party opposing the Government on other areas of policy.
