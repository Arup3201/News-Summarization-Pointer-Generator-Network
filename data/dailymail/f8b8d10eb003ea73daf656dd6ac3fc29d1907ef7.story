Special guest: Labour MP panellist Pater Hain was flown to South Africa for the show, and part of his journey was in business class

The BBC spent thousands sending eight staff to South Africa for a special Question Time last night while Labour panellist Peter Hain was flown business class, MailOnline can reveal today.

Viewers have repeatedly slammed the Corporation's 'excessive' coverage of Nelson Mandela's death and last night the BBC programme presented by David Dimbleby was broadcast from Johannesburg.

Producers say the decision was taken to give Britain 'an insight into the personal and political views of people in South Africa in a way that would not have been possible in a broadcast from the UK'.

But critics have accused bosses of 'wasting massive amounts of money', and maintain the show should have stayed here.

MailOnline has learned that MP for Neath Peter Hain, a well-known anti-apartheid campaigner, was flown out at the BBC's expense to appear on the show.

He spoke alongside five South Africans including Pik Botha, the country's foreign minister during the 1980s.

Mr Hain was flown direct to Johannesburg from the UK and came home via Amsterdam. His journey from South Africa to Holland was in business class, the BBC admitted.

But they refused to reveal how much his flights, and the flights for the eight production staff, cost them.

Presenter David Dimbleby flew to the country with the wider BBC team after Mandela died, but it is not known which class he travelled in.

The Question Time set, cameras and other equipment was provided by the South African studio they rented.

Tory member of the culture, media and sport select committee, Philip Davies said: 'It just proves how overfunded the BBC is if they can spend money on this kind of largesse.

'The BBC is spending other people's money and that is why it doesn't matter to them. They are spending the money of many people who are struggling to pay their licence fee.'

Question Time: The show was shown on British television, but not in South Africa, and the set and equipment was sourced from the Johannesburg studios

Programme: David Dimbleby was already in South Africa before Question Time, which also had Pik Botha on the panel

Derek Sim wrote on Twitter: 'The BBC spend even more money in arranging Question Time in South Africa, why and for whose benefit? Certainly not us. What a waste.

The other panellists were Lindiwe Zulu, an advisor to President Zuma, Andile Mngxitama, a member of the
 Economic Freedom Fighters group in South Africa, Lindiwe Mazibuko, leader of the country's opposition
 party and Eusebius 
McKeizer, a journalist.

They were asked about issues like whether it was wrong to boo Jacob Zuma at Nelson Mendela's memorial on Tuesday and whether 'racism is over' in the country.

BBC bosses are already under fire after it emerged it sent  nearly three times as many staff to South Africa than all of its rival 
British broadcasters put together.

After Mandela's death the corporation sent a total of 140 presenters and crew members to South 
Africa, while Sky News had the second highest number of the British 
broadcasters with 15.

The BBC said it expected to have deployed about 120 journalists, 
technicians and support staff to work on the story over a ten-day 
period. The BBC World 
Service is also reported to have sent a further 20 staff, whose expenses
 will not be paid for by licence-fee payers.

ITV and Channel 4 sent nine people to cover the event in South Africa, while Channel 5 sent four.

This week it revealed it had received nearly 1,700 complaints over its 'excessive' coverage and Ofcom has also been contacted by disgruntled viewers.

The BBC has 
defended its coverage and said Mandela's death was of 'considerable 
interest' to audiences in the UK and across the rest of the world.

A spokesman said: 'Nelson Mandela’s death was a hugely significant global story and the programme gave viewers an insight into the personal and political views of people in South Africa in a way that would not have been possible in a broadcast from the UK.

The number of BBC staff sent to South Africa was far greater than its rivals, including ITV which reportedly despatched just nine crew to cover proceedings

A team of eight production staff went to Johannesburg and all the set and equipment was locally sourced.

'Peter Hain was an integral part of the panel, bringing the UK government’s involvement into the wider story. We felt his inclusion was important and so we did pay for his flights but we kept costs as low as we could.

Touching on the number of staff the corporation has sent to South Africa, the spokesman added: 'Unlike other UK networks, we’ve been providing coverage across numerous domestic and global outlets from a number of different locations for TV, radio and online, including live broadcasts on BBC Two, rolling news on the News Channel and World News, BBC Breakfast, three daily news bulletins, coverage across a number of radio programmes and bulletins on 5live, Radio 4 and Radio 2. As always we sought to ensure maximum value for money.'
