Built in the 1700s it overlooks Milford Haven, the deep water harbour from which Henry II led his army to Ireland in 1172. 

It was built under the instruction of Trinity House, the body which oversees safe shipping in Britain, in the mid 17th century to allow the safe shipping of vessels approaching the Haven. 

It was intended to be supported by payment of dues, but the then owners illegally charged shipowners, forcing the light to be discontinued. 

In 1712, a patent was granted to build a lighthouse again, and the land was leased to Joseph Allen who agreed to create two lighthouses and keep them in good condition. 

Mr Allen paid £10 a year on a 99-year lease and was given a penny for every ton of cargo shipped through the waters for to help maintain the lights. 

In 1714, he built two towers near the disused lighthouse and lit coal fires in them. 

Other lighthouses in the area, repaired and renovated to become luxury homes, have been sold in the past for more than £1million. 

In July, Point Lynas lighthouse in Anglesey was put on sale for £1.3million. The working lighthouse was built in 1835 and was sold alongside three cottages on its grounds.

Milford Haven (seen from the viewing deck, above) is considered one of the country's finest deep water harbours by maritime experts

Perched atop a cliff overlooking the Irish Sea, the property was built in the 18th century but has been consistently repaired and refurbished

With uninterrupted views of the Irish Sea, the unique property is being sold by Coasty estate agents in Dale, South Wales
