The best-selling horror author James Herbert, described as ‘one of the giants of popular fiction’, died yesterday aged 69.

Mr Herbert, who wrote horror classic The Rats, died only a week after his 23rd novel, Ash, was published.

He was prolific, releasing a new novel almost every year between 1974 and 1988, but said he remained ‘very insecure’ about his skills as a writer.

His fans disagreed and he sold more than 54million books and was translated into 34 languages.

Acclaimed: Best selling author James Herbert has died at his Sussex home aged 69, his publisher announced today

A spokesman for his publisher Pan Macmillan said Mr Herbert died peacefully in bed at his home in Sussex yesterday morning.

No cause of death was given but the spokesman said he had not been ill.

He is survived by Eileen, his wife of 46 years, and their three daughters Kerry, Emma and Casey.

Jeremy Trevathan, his publisher of ten years, paid tribute to him as an author with a ‘rare distinction’.

‘Jim Herbert was one of the keystone authors in a genre that had its heyday in the 1970s and 1980s,’ he said.

Popular: Several of Mr Herbert's books including classic The Rats, were made into films

‘It’s a true testament to his 
writing and his enduring creativity that his books continued to be huge 
bestsellers right up until his death.

‘He has the rare distinction that his
novels were considered classics of the genre within his lifetime.

His 
death marks the passing of one of the giants of popular fiction in the 
20th century.’

The youngest of three brothers, Mr 
Herbert was born and raised in the East End of London.

His childhood was
what he later described as a ‘hand to mouth’ existence.

As a boy he often told dark stories 
to entertain his friends, inspired by watching the rats running in the 
bomb sites around them.

After school and art college Mr Herbert worked for an advertising agency.

Booker Prize winning author Salman Rushdie worked at the same agency at the same time.

He wrote his first novel, The Rats, 
aged 28. The book, which depicted a London overrun by mutant, 
flesh-eating rodents, was rejected by the first five publishers he sent 
it to.

When it was published in 1974 it was an immediate hit - the first printing of 100,000 copies sold out in three weeks.

The book is said to have been based on a 
line in Dracula in which a lunatic says that he has seen 1,000 rats with
red eyes staring up from the lawn.

Among his other novels were The Magic Cottage and The Secret of Crickley Hall. Four of his books were made into films. The Magic Cottage was dramatised for Radio 4.

His 23rd novel, Ash, the tale of a paranormal detective who is sent to investigate the crucifixion of a man in a locked room at a remote Scottish castle, was published last week.

The author was awarded an OBE in the 
2010 Birthday Honours list and the same year he was made the Grand 
Master of Horror by the World of Horror Convention.

One of his friends, Gordon Giltrap, paid tribute to the author on Twitter.

Posting
from @gordongiltrap, he said: 'Received some sad news this morning that
my good friend James Herbert has passed away. Am in no mood for music, 
that’s for sure. RIP Jim.'

Author
William Hussey tweeted: 'The Fog has dispersed, the lights in the Magic
Cottage have dimmed, Crickley Hall stands silent. RIP #JamesHerbert.'

Another, Peter James, wrote: 'Deeply saddened to hear today that my dear friend, writer James Herbert, died last night. Will miss you lots, Jim, you were a diamond.'

Almost 3,000 fans have left messages in tribute to Mr Herbert on his official Facebook page since the news of his death was announced.

One, Gary Alcock, wrote: 'I've been reading his books since I was 13 years old.

'I remember picking up a copy of The Rats in a second hand book shop back in 1985 and was hooked for life. Gutted.'

The critically acclaimed author has been the UK's bestselling horror writer since his first novel The Rats in 1974.

Stars such as Robert Powell, Sir John Gielgud, Kate Beckinsale, Matthew Modine and Samuel L jackson have all starred in screen adaptations of his work.

Tributes: James Herbert, pictured back in 2005, has been described as a 'giant of popular fiction' by his peers

James Herbert is best known for horror novels such as The Rats and The Survivor, but he published more than 20 books in all. His titles included:

Big screen version: Matthew Modine was one of the stars of the 1995 film adaptation of James Herbert's novel Fluke (pictured)

Last adaptation: Suranne Jones starred as Eve Caleigh and Tom Ellis played Gabe Caleigh in the BBC's small screen adaptation of The Secret of Crickley Hall late last year

The most recent conversion of his 
writing from the page to the screen was the BBC adaptation of The Secret
of Crickley Hall which was shown over three Sundays back in November 
which pulled in more than seven million viewers at its peak and starred 
Suranne Jones and Tom Ellis.

In an article written for MailOnline 
in October last year, the novelist said that when the BBC first 
approached him with the idea for a television adaptation of Crickley 
Hall, he was sceptical.

He said: 'I actually thought the book
was unfilmable because the story was complicated and revolves around 
the Second World War, yet is simultaneously set in the present day.'

But he added: 'By the time you've 
watched The Secret Of Crickley Hall your emotions will have been given a
thorough workout, and your mind aggressively exercised!'

As well as his novels, Mr Herbert also published a range of short stories including Maurice and Mog, Breakfast and Cora's Needs.
