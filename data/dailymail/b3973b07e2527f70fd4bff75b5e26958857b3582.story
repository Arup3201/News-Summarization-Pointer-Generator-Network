Seth Meyers' co-anchor position on Saturday Night Live's Weekend Update will be filled by an unfamiliar face at the sketch comedy show.

Colin Jost will be stepping out of the writer's room and in front of the camera to takeover from Meyers who is departing to host NBC's Late Night. Meyers' last show will be February 1.

SNL cast-member Cecily Strong will continue to co-host alongside Jost, the current SNL head writer.

This isn't the first time that a head writer has been put in the Weekend Update chair.

Seth Meyers was head writer before he started reading the news, and so was Tina Fey before she made the same transition.

Jost has been a writer on the show since 2005, shortly after he graduated from Harvard.

While his time at SNL has been focused on penning the jokes, his IMDB page lists that he acted in at least two episodes of the show.

He also performs his own work in stand-up shows, and has appeared on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon and John Oliver's new York Stand-Up Show.

Jost is a native of New York and grew up on State Island. He even wrote an autobiographical movie about growing up in the borough called 'Staten Island Summer'. It has yet to be released but stars Gina Gershon, Ashley Greene, Kate Walsh and Jim Gaffigan, and current SNL cast member Bobby Moynihan.

One of his more popular sketches was a fake perfume add for Chanel 'Red Flag' - a fragrance that warns men when a woman is 'f****** crazy'.
