A mother who pays £130 a month to drive her autistic son to school has hit out at the 'unfair system' after Katie Price revealed her son's transport is paid for by the taxpayer.

Caren Taylor, 44, spoke after the millionaire glamour model defended her right to have council-funded taxi rides for her 12-year-old disabled son Harvey.

Mrs Taylor and her husband, a telecommunications worker, receive no council support for their son Reiss, also 12, who attends a special school.

She says driving 32 miles a day to and from his school has left her unable to hold down a job.

She and husband Stephen, from Wigan, Lancashire, said they were left feeling unfairly treated after hearing the revelation from Katie Price on Celebrity Big Brother.

Reiss and Harvey are the same age. Both have severe autism, both attend special schools assigned to them by the council and both schools are outside the council area where they live.

Harvey also has severe disabilities alongside his autism. He suffers from a genetic condition which has left him blind and unable to walk long distances unaided. He also has ADHD.

Because councils examine cases individually without looking at income, there are differences from one area or one case to the next.

That means Miss Price has received support from her local council, thought to be West Sussex, but the Taylors have not had any transport paid for by Wigan Council.

Mrs Taylor said: 'I don't blame Katie Price at all. She is taking what has been offered to her, despite the fact she probably doesn't need it.

'I just feel that everyone should be put into the same boat, no matter who they are. It's something that really needs highlighting.

'The system seems so unfair. It costs us approximately £130 a month in fuel, which we can barely afford.

'I have to go on the M6 where there can be a lot of traffic. It can take between 25 minutes to an hour and a half, and I have to make that journey twice a day. 

'I know of at least three other families whose special needs children are educated out of borough and are provided with either transport or given a fuel allowance, so why are we treated differently?'

Mrs Taylor, who gave up her job as an operations manager when Reiss was two, described her son as 'much like a toddler' who struggles to understand his surroundings and personal safety.

'He gets into everything,' she said. 'He will go to a hot stove when it's on. He's got no concept of road awareness whatsoever.

'He would run across a road if he saw something on the other side.' 

Mrs Taylor and her husband have another son, ten-year-old Mitchell. 

She said her husband, a former telecommunications firm supervisor, was unemployed for four months last year after being 'unfairly dismissed', a claim he plans to fight in a tribunal.

That left the parents almost penniless while they tried to keep paying for fuel.

Although Mr Taylor, 47, is now working for another telecommunications firm, he is earning £6,000 a year less and the family struggles to make ends meet.

'We were unable to claim benefits during this time and so ended up having to spend most of our life savings,' Mrs Taylor said.

'He has a new job, but is on a lower wage and I can't work as I need to do the school runs.'

Reiss joined his current school, Wargrave House in Newton-Le-Willows, Lancashire, after his mother removed him from Wigan's Landgate School in 2012 because he was unhappy and losing weight. She also said several parents had concerns about the way pupils were treated at the school.

The old school was just a mile from his home, and the new school is eight miles away. 

She said she had to home-school him for more than a year while she waited for Wigan Council to arrange his new placement.

After the place was confirmed, the family said they made two requests for help - and both were refused, despite their situation becoming far more desperate.

Mrs Taylor's husband not only lost his job but was also diagnosed with skin cancer, and her father had a stroke.

Mrs Taylor added: 'When we applied for transport after he had started, we were given an outright "no".

'I told the Local Education Authority about the amount of pressure I was going through but they made no effort to help us in any way, making the process as difficult as possible.

'The second time they've just seen that they've declined us before and not even bothered to look into our circumstances again.' 

James Winterbottom, Wigan Council's interim director of children and families, said: 'The council’s view was that Reiss's special educational needs could be met in the borough.

'It was considered to be parental choice that Reiss attended Wargrave School, and therefore as part of the agreement with parents the council would name Wargrave on the condition that parents meet the transport costs and the parents agreed to this.'

Katie Price passionately defended her right to bill the taxpayer for Harvey's transport after revealing the situation on Celebrity Big Brother. 

A spokesman for Miss Price said in a statement: 'Where any child that is placed in school out of the immediate home area it is the Local Authorities' DUTY to provide transport that meets the child's needs.

'This is common practice for all disabled children as there are not enough suitable schools available to them.'

Miss Price said paying for her private driver, a private nurse and fuel for the one and a half hour round trip to Harvey's London school would cost £1,000 a day.

'The cost of the school placement together with transport is not means tested as it is provided for the child,' she added.

'Local Authorities do not have special needs schools locally as these have been closed during the last 15 years as it was deemed a cheaper option to transport children out of borough.

'If Harvey's school was on his doorstep as with schools for healthy children, then this would not apply, but it was the government's choice to close the special needs schools.'

Councils must to provide transport to any pupil who is deemed to need it as part of their statement of Special Educational Needs.

This transport can range from paid-for taxis and minibuses to bus and train passes, fuel allowances and 'independent travel training'.

Many councils have been trying to cut down on the number of taxis they use in order to save money.

West Sussex County Council, believed to be the responsible for the area where Katie Price lives, guarantees free transport with no means-testing for all children with special educational needs who cannot attend a school within three miles of their home.

The council says that the use of taxis rather than bus, car or train is allowed 'in exceptional circumstances only, usually for children with severe disabilities'.
