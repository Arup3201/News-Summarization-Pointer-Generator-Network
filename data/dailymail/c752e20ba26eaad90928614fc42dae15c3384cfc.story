Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg has come under fire after her nonprofit - which has the sole purpose of improving womens' economic mobility - posted an ad seeking an unpaid intern.

The editor of Sandberg's LeanIn.Org foundation, a nonprofit that goes by the same name as her bestselling book, posted the ad to Facebook Tuesday. Sanberg

'Wanted: Lean In editorial intern, to work with our editor (me) in New York,' Jessica Bennett, the foundation's editor, wrote. 'Part-time, unpaid, must be HIGHLY organized with editorial and social chops and able to commit to a regular schedule through end of year. Design and web skills a plus! HIT ME UP. Start date ASAP.'

The post, first reported on by Valley Wag, garnered hundreds of critical comments, mainly from people who argued that hiring a free intern is directly opposed to the stated goals of the nonprofit. 

'When we've reached the point where working without pay is considered a legitimate "opportunity," that's when you know something is seriously and fundamentally broken,' wrote Noella Paterson. 

Another commenter wrote: 'Why does lean in offer an unpaid internship? Really? I thought women should lean in and demand more money. Unpaid work, be it internships for young women or volunteer positions for older moms, is exploitative. Shame on lean in. Pay up.'

Sandberg, who joined Facebook in 2008, is worth
 is an estimated $1 billion. Just last week, she sold nearly 2.4 million
 shares of the social network's stock worth roughly $91 million. She 
still holds more than 14 million shares, according to Bloomberg News.

In an effort to quell the brewing controversy, Bennett posted a message late Wednesday disassociating the position from LeanIn.Org.

Bennett followed up her original post with a message distancing the internship position from the Lean In foundation

'Dear What Appears to Be My Entire 
Facebook Feed: Want to clarify previous Lean In post,' she wrote. 'This 
was MY post, on MY feed, looking for a volunteer to help me in New York.
 LOTS of nonprofits accept volunteers. This was NOT an official Lean In 
job posting. Let's all take a deep breath.'

Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for LeanIn.Org, told the Washington Post that it is not unusual for the nonprofit - like many nonprofits -  to rely on the work of volunteers.

'LeanIn.Org, like many nonprofits, has enjoyed the participation of some part-time volunteers to help us advance our education and peer support programs,' she said.

Facebook brought in $1.8 billion in revenue last quarter and it's projected to reach sales of more than $16 billion by 2017.
