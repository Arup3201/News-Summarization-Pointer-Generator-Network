Anthony Weiner and Huma Abedin have been spotted searching for a new apartment as their current apartment rent is too steep.

The disgraced former congressman and his political advisor wife have been living in an apartment which is estimated to cost $12,000-per-month in rent since he resigned amid a sexting scandal in 2011.

The Flatiron apartment was being rented to them by Democratic donor Jack Rosen, who is close with Bill Clinton, the former president who officiated Weiner and Abedin's nuptials.

Inevitable: Weiner blasted CitiHabitats on Twitter after the broker spoke to a tabloid about what apartment the couple were considering

Now they are looking to move to a slightly cheaper apartment with their son Jordan but are apparently staying in the neighborhood.

The New York Post reported that the couple have been seen looking at a three-bedroom, two-and-a-half bath apartment in a doorman building on East 23rd Street.

CitiHabitats realtor Brian Morgan allegedly showed the couple the $8,000-per-month apartment in the modern building.

'He didn’t talk much; she was very nice. She was in control. She was asking all the questions and was way more vocal,' Mr Morgan told The Post.

It comes as little surprise that just hours after the report was published, the former Congressman blasted the real estate company for not only allowing their broker to publicly speak about their working relationship, but to publicize it on their own Twitter account.

Even though Weiner put down the company as having 'no class brokers', he didn't deny the report.

The new building that they are looking at is only a few blocks further east than their current apartment, and it comes as little surprise that they would like to stay in the area: Anthony's brother Jason owns L&W Oyster Bar and Almond, two restaurants in the neighborhood.

Daddy duty: Weiner has been regularly spotted with his son in the area around their apartment, taking now-2-year-old Jordan to the grocery store and the playground in Union Square

The couple married in June 2010 and 
their home base was the apartment he owned in Forest Hills, which fell 
in his congressional district in Queens.

Shortly
 after he resigned in 2011- meaning that he no longer had to live in the
 district that he once represented- the couple sold his co-op apartment 
and moved to one of Manhattan's most expensive neighborhoods.

Before the scandal, Abedin was best known in political circles for being Hillary Clinton's top aide, and she has worked with the former Secretary of State for decades.

Weiner has said in previous interviews that he gave his wife full reign to pick their new apartment amid the controversy he put them both through.

They have been seen walking around the neighborhood by MailOnline, with Weiner shopping in the local grocery store and bringing their now-2-year-old son Jordan to the playground in nearby Union Square.

For a while, they hoped that they would be calling Gracey Mansion home, as Weiner attempted to re-enter the public sphere by running for mayor, but his candidacy ended in flames when more dirty sexts and emails were released by a young woman who had a virtual relationship with the married man after he had already resigned from office.

Now Abedin is still working for Mrs Clinton, and is considered to be one of the closest ‘gate keepers’ to the likely Democratic presidential candidate.

Weiner has made a guest appearance on the new Amazon political comedy Alpha House and is restarting some of the consulting work that he had been doing in the time between his resignation and his failed mayoral bid.
