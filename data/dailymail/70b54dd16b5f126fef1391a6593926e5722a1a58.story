The much-loved Florida manatee could soon be taken off the endangered species list and reclassified as ‘threatened’ according to wildlife officials.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is reviewing whether the gentle manatee should be reclassified as a ‘threatened species,’ because they're no longer facing extinction.

Under a 1967 law, the manatee were given a federal listing as an endangered species, the most protective classification.

But Florida's manatee population has grown from several hundred in 1967 to over 4,800 this year.

Now environmentalists are engaged in an ongoing fight with a group of boaters, businesses and conservatives over whether the manatee should have its status changed.

Agency spokesman, Chuck Underwood said: ‘If we come to the end of this and decide reclassification is warranted, it's good news because it means the manatee is recovering and no longer on the brink of extinction.’

The agency is seeking public comment on its finding that a petition to reclassify the manatee has merits by Tuesday.

A decision on whether a change is warranted won't be made until the agency completes its review, which could take a year.

But hundreds of manatees are still being scarred 
and having their tails disfigured from boat propellers zooming around 
Florida's waters which is leaving them unable to survive in the wild.

Chicago resident Greg Groff regularly stops by the Miami Seaquarium with his young daughter Olivia to see the speed bump-shaped marine mammals.

As he watched the sea cows swim in circles, he noted the pink scars on one’s body.

He argues that the manatees need even more stringent protections than their listing on the federal endangered species list.

He said boaters should go elsewhere if they don't like speed limits in waters where manatees swim.

Manatees, also known as sea cows, are vegetarian giants that average nearly 10 feet long and 2,200 pounds.

They live near the shore and in coastal waterways around much of Florida.

The animal's biggest threats are boats, cold water, toxic algae blooms and fishing debris like discarded lines and ropes.

A record 829 manatees died last year, breaking the 2010 record of 766, according to state records.

But the most worrisome deaths last year were not collisions with boats.

A record 276 manatee deaths were caused by a toxic red tide bloom in the Gulf of Mexico.

There were also the unexplained deaths of more than 100 manatees on Florida's east coast, where pollution and algae blooms have plagued a vital lagoon ecosystem.

Meanwhile, critics of the manatee's current endangered listing say manatees are important to the state's tourism industry and environment.

They suggest that the species has recovered sufficiently over the last 47 years to be reclassified.

Under current regulations, boaters must avoid manatee areas or obey tight speed limits and fishermen can't use some equipment.

In 2012, Save Crystal River Inc. and the conservative Pacific Legal Foundation petitioned the government to reclassify the manatee.

The group represents about 100 members that include recreational boaters, tour operators, dive shops and hotels.

They cited a 2007 federal review that recommended listing the species as threatened since the population is recovering.

Steve Lamb, vice president of Save Crystal River said: ‘The truth is the manatee is protected the same as threatened as endangered, but they no longer can use the species to take over sovereign lands and sovereign waters with arbitrary rules.’

According to the wildlife service, officials began working on the reclassification proposal in 2013.

It was shelved due to funding constraints during the U.S. government shutdown and concerns over recent spikes in manatee deaths.

Save the Manatees Club Executive Director Pat Rose said that while the species has certainly rebounded, more work needs to be done.

‘The most compelling reason not to down-list them is the status of their ecosystems,’ Rose said.

‘If you maintain good quality habitat, you can overcome catastrophic mortality events.

‘If you are dealing with both catastrophic mortality events and unrelenting compromises to their aquatic ecosystems at the same time, that's when you need to be acting very conservatively.

But Lamb says the government is bowing to political pressure and emotion, highlighting conservation efforts at the expense of the law and business.

‘Does anyone ever want to talk about how last year 1,000 manatees were born? Heck, no. All they want to talk about is how many died,’ Lamb said.
