The US espionage scandal shows no signs of letting up with Spanish media reporting that the NSA monitored tens of millions of phone calls in Spain between December 2012 and early 2013.

The NSA allegedly gathered intelligence on 60 million phone calls made in Spain, which included callers’ numbers and locations, but not conversations.

The reports' source was freshly leaked information from whistleblower Edward Snowden.

Scandal: Spanish paper El Mundo's front page on Monday was dominated by the revelation that the NSA monitored phone calls made in Spain

The National Security Agency (NSA) headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland: The organisation has allegedly been spying on European leaders and Spanish phone calls

Unhappy: Mrs Merkel (pictured right, arriving for a summit) made stern remarks at the EU gathering which indicated she was not placated by talks with President Obama

The revelation followed claims that 
U.S. President Barack Obama was personally informed of phone tapping 
against German Chancellor Angela Merkel, which may have begun as early 
as 2002, according to German media.

Bild
am Sonntag newspaper quoted U.S. intelligence sources as saying that 
National Security Agency chief Keith Alexander had briefed Obama on the 
operation against Merkel in 2010.

'Obama did not halt the operation but rather let it continue,' the newspaper quoted a high-ranking NSA official as saying.

News
weekly Der Spiegel reported that leaked NSA documents showed that 
Merkel's phone had appeared on a list of spying targets since 2002, and 
was still under surveillance weeks before Obama visited Berlin in June.

As
a sense of betrayal spread in many world capitals allegedly targeted by
the NSA, European leaders are calling for a new deal with Washington on
intelligence gathering that would maintain an essential alliance while 
keeping the fight against terrorism on track.

Germany will send its own spy chiefs to Washington soon to demand answers.

Meanwhile
several thousand protesters gathered in Washington Saturday to push for
new U.S. legislation to curb the NSA's activities.

Swiss president Ueli Maurer warned that the scandal risked 'undermining confidence between states'.

'We
don't know if we're only seeing the tip of the iceberg or if other 
governments are acting in the same ruthless manner,' he told the Schweiz
am Sonntag weekly.

Merkel 
confronted Obama with the snooping allegations in a phone call on 
Wednesday saying that such spying would be a 'breach of trust' between 
international partners.

The suspicion also prompted Berlin to summon the U.S. ambassador - a highly unusual move between the close allies.

The
Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported without citing its 
sources that Obama had told Merkel during their call that he had been 
unaware of any spying against her.

Der Spiegel said he told her that if he had been informed of the operation he would have stopped it at once.

Other
media reports said that Obama's National Security Advisor Susan Rice 
had also told German officials the president knew nothing of the spying.

Merkel's office declined to comment on what he told her during their conversation.

The
White House has said it is not monitoring Merkel's phone calls and will
not do so in future, but it has refused to say whether it did 
previously.

Bild am Sonntag 
said that Obama wanted to be informed in detail about Merkel, who has 
played a decisive role in the eurozone debt crisis and is widely seen as
Europe's most powerful leader.

As
a result, the report said, the NSA stepped up its surveillance of her 
communications, targeting not only the mobile phone she uses to conduct 
business for her conservative Christian Democratic Union party but also 
her encrypted official device.

Merkel only acquired the latter handset over the summer.

Bild
said U.S. intelligence specialists were then able to monitor the 
content of her conversations as well as text messages, which Merkel 
sends by the dozen each day to key associates.

Only
the specially secured land line in her office was out of the reach of 
the NSA, which sent the intelligence gathered straight to the White 
House bypassing the agency's headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland, 
according to the report.

Bild
and Spiegel described a hive of spy activity on the fourth floor of the
US embassy in central Berlin, a stone's throw from the government 
quarter, from which the United States kept tabs on Merkel and other 
German officials.

Spiegel 
cited a classified 2010 document indicating that U.S. intelligence had 
80 high-tech surveillance offices worldwide in cities including Paris, 
Madrid, Rome, Prague, Geneva and Frankfurt.

If
the spying against Merkel began in 2002, it would mean the United 
States under then president George W. Bush targeted her while she was 
still the country's chief opposition leader, three years before she 
became chancellor.

Bild said
Merkel's predecessor Gerhard Schroeder was also in the NSA's sights 
because of his vocal opposition to the US invasion of Iraq and close 
ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin.

As anger simmered in Berlin, Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich sharpened his tone.

'Surveillance is a crime and those responsible must be brought to justice,' he told Bild.

A
poll for the newspaper found that 76 percent of Germans believe Obama 
should apologise for the alleged spying on Merkel, and 60 percent said 
the scandal had damaged German-U.S. ties.

The scandal derived from documents acquired from Snowden by Spiegel.

The Social Democrats' chief whip Thomas Oppermann told Bild that German MPs would now like to question Snowden.

'Snowden's accounts seem credible while the U.S. government apparently lied to us about this matter.'

Last week Snowden hit back at claims by a U.S. government official that collating phone records is not ‘surveillance’.

Statement: Snowden insisted that every phone call and internet transaction made in America is logged

Senator
Dianne Feinstein wrote in a newspaper recently that what the NSA is 
gathering is not protected under the Fourth Amendment, which prohibits 
unreasonable searches.

She 
wrote in USA Today on Sunday: ‘The call-records program is not 
surveillance. It does not collect the content of any communication, nor 
do the records include names or locations.’

She
added: ‘The NSA only collects the type of information found on a 
telephone bill: phone numbers of calls placed and received, the time of 
the calls and duration. The Supreme Court has held this "metadata" is 
not protected under the Fourth Amendment.’

However
Snowden, although he didn’t name the lawmaker, clearly had her comments
in mind when he gave a statement to the American Civil Liberties Union 
about phone tracking.

He said: ‘In the last four months, we've learned a lot about our government.

‘We've
learned that the U.S. intelligence community secretly built a system of
pervasive surveillance. Today, no telephone in America makes a call 
without leaving a record with the NSA. Today, no internet transaction 
enters or leaves America without passing through the NSA's hands. Our 
representatives in Congress tell us this is not surveillance. They're 
wrong.’

He made the 
statement in support of the demonstration against government privacy 
invasion that took place in Washington D.C on Saturday.
