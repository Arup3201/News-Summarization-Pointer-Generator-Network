Belgium are two for two so far in this World Cup and they took time out from training ahead of their final group match with South Korea to attend a charity event for children in Brazil.

Captain Vincent Kompany, Chelsea goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois and Manchester United winger Adnan Januzaj were among the players to wear glasses at a project in Mogi das Cruzes.

The Eyes for the World Association aims to provide adaptable glasses - cheaper than conventional spectacles - for poor children who are visually impaired.
