An armed man who had to be shot with rubber bullets following a stand-off with police was heard saying he wanted to emulate one-eyed cop killer Dale Cregan.

Genus Zanzibar yesterday admitted possessing a Bear Grylls Scout knife and a homemade shield, which had numerous screws or nails protruding from it, in public.

The 39-year-old was involved in a three-hour stand-off with police at his home in Walney, Cumbria on Wednesday.

During his appearance at Furness Magistrates’ Court yesterday, Mr Lee Dacre, prosecuting, said a member of the public heard Zanzibar tell a negotiator 'come near me and I’ll cut your throat'.

He was also reportedly heard to say: 'I’m doing a Dale Cregan'.

Cregan is currently in prison for murdering four people including two policewomen in Manchester. 

The incident started around 12.45pm when a psychiatric nurse went to Zanzibar’s home to administer medication he was required to take while on licence with the probation service.

He was found kneeling on the grass outside, wearing a motorbike helmet and motorbike suit and said: 'I don’t want to see you today.'

The nurse was concerned about the behaviour and called the police.

Two officers arrived and found him carrying a six-inch blade and triangular shield with around 20 nails or screws banged into it.

Zanzibar took a 'fighting stance' and the police called for back-up, which included firearms officers and dog handlers.

One officer described how he feared for himself and colleagues after Zanzibar moved towards him and did not obey instructions to put down the weapons.

Mr Dacre said a Taser was used to no avail and baton rounds - described as a type of rubber bullet - were fired to take him down and retrieve the weapons.

The court heard Zanzibar has 15 
convictions for 29 offences. In July last year he was given a 12-month 
prison sentence, suspended for 18 months.

Response: Police confirmed they were forced to fire rubber bullets in order to detain the man

Zanzibar, representing himself, said: 'The reason I did what I did was to make a bid for freedom.

'I feel oppressed by the institutions and society. I feel they are forcing me to take medication I don’t want to take and feel I don’t need to take.'

He has been remanded in custody and will appear at Preston Crown Court on February 14.
