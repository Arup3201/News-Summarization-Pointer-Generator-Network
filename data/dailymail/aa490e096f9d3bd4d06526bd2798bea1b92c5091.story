Brentford's Mark Warburton may not be one of the famous managerial names in English football, but Marcos Tebar says he’s in the same bracket as Jose Mourinho and Manuel Pellegrini. 

Tebar signed a two-year deal at SkyBet Championship newboys Brentford this summer, having learnt his trade at Real Madrid.

The Spanish midfielder, who made just one senior appearance at the Bernabeu, had first-hand experience of working with Mourinho and Pellegrini but believes his new manager is best suited to his style of play.

Tebar said: ‘I played with the first team at Real Madrid during pre-season under both Jose Mourinho and Manuel Pellegrini.

‘I was at Madrid during Mourinho’s first season and he had a very good relationship with the players.

‘I improved my football under him, mainly the defensive side of my game.

‘Pellegrini was also a good manager and I think he wants to play more with the ball whereas Mourinho is more defensive.

Spanish flair: Tebar came through the ranks at Real Madrid and played for Almeria in La Liga last season

‘But Warburton is also very good. I like his style of play, it is good for me because it is the way I like to play football. I like to be in possession and pass the ball.

‘Out of the three managers I would say Mark’s style of football suits me the best, I feel comfortable with the way he plays the game.’

Tebar was close to moving to Griffin Park last season before making the switch to Almeria in La Liga.

But Warburton finally got his man this summer when the 28-year-old terminated his contract in Spain.

The midfielder is determined to make his name for himself in England and dreams of following other Spaniards by starring in the Premier League.

He added: ‘Last year I was close to coming to Brentford, but at the last moment I got an offer from Almeria and I wanted to test myself in La Liga.

‘But I had another offer from Brentford this summer and this time I came because I wanted to play in England.

‘Playing in La Liga was a great experience for me. Two of the best players in the world play there, Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, and challenging them and trying to get the ball off them is very hard.

‘But I have signed a contract for two years with an option for a third at Brentford, so I want to be an important player in this team and play here for a long time.’

Trophy boy: Manuel Pellegrini helped Manchester City to the Premier League title last season

Brentford’s return to the second tier of English football ended 21 years in the bottom two divisions.

And Warburton is not going into this season just to make up the numbers, with a new stadium on horizon, there is plenty of positivity around the west London club as they head into their season opener against capital rivals Charlton.

The former Watford academy coach wants the Bees to follow the path set by Sean Dyche’s Burnley last season.

Tough test: Tebar pitted his wits against the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo last campaign

Warburton said: ‘Our long-term aim is to fill the new stadium. That’s what we use as our driving force in the dressing room – to fill a 20,000-seater stadium.

‘How do we do that? By playing the right type of football to get the fan base in, but we’ve got to believe in what we do.

‘We’ll set short-term targets, every five or seven games, but it’s about us having the self-belief.

‘We’ve got to look at positive examples, like Burnley last year.

Great job: Warburton wants Brentford to follow the influence of Burnley and Sean Dyche 

‘Sean Dyche did a magnificent job on one of the smallest budgets in the division.

‘It’s not about budget all the time, it’s about discipline, self-belief and Sean had that in abundance. We’ve got to learn from that and try to replicate it here.

‘We’re good friends and spoke a lot last year. He spoke of his budget being a survival one really, so it shows the quality of job he did.

‘That tells our players it’s not about having people on 20 or 30 grand a week. It’s about applying yourself and maximising what you have.’

If Warburton does manage follow Burnley into the Premier League then there could be more people than just Tebar comparing him to Mourinho and Pellegrini.
