The most underrated player in the Premier League? Jack Colback.

In an era when we are searching for young English talent, players who can keep the ball; and admiring – almost over-admiring – those who step forward and show some technique, it’s amazing this kid has been overlooked.

He’s not only got ability, he’s got bottle as well.

For a kid to let his contract run down so that he can leave Sunderland on a free transfer and join his boyhood club Newcastle United, is the ultimate in football bravery. It’s right up there with Sol Campbell’s evil switch from Spurs to Arsenal.

Campbell recently claimed he was surprised at the venomous reaction from the Spurs fans. I hope Colback isn’t as naive – he will get fearful abuse from the Sunderland fans when the Tyne/Wear derbies take place.

But he doesn’t deserve it.

Cross rivalry: Colback's move is right up there with Sol Campbell¿s evil switch from Arsenal to Spurs

Put it this way – if Colback had come through the acclaimed Southampton academy, he would have made their first team, played in central midfield and probably been in Brazil right now preparing for Manaus.

But Sunderland shifted him to left back, kept changing manager, and Colback’s talents have never really been able to flourish over a decent period of time at the Stadium of Light.

Colback was in the same youth team as Jordan Henderson. When a space came up in the Sunderland midfield, Henderson took it, and Colback went on loan to Ipswich. It could easily have been the other way round.

All change: Sunderland's form drastically improved when Gus Poyet put Jack Colback back into midfield

Gus Poyet eventually trusted Colback in central midfield, and Sunderland’s form was phenomenal.

He’s just an honest lad who wants to play for the club he supported as a boy, his hometown team.

Every Sunderland supporter can understand that concept, so they should thank Jack, wish him all the best, and move on.

But football sadly doesn’t work like that.

Unbelievable: Gus Poyet worked a miracle to eventually keep Sunderland in the Premier League
