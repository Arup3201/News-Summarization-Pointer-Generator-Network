It started at birth but quickly turned into an all-consuming obsession.

Indian real estate agent Sevenraj's father named him after the number seven, and since then, he has spent his life surrounding himself with the number.

But it didn't stop there - he developed an extreme fixation on the colours red and white.

And seeing him dressed in a red and white suit, driving a red and white car and living in a red and white house, it is hard not to take notice.

While his obsession with the number seven began when he was named, his peculiar attraction to red and white started as a wacky marketing gimmick and has seen him become a full blown home town celebrity.

Sevenraj's obsession has taken over the family home with everything possible a shade of red or white

There is now no doubt that what started as a gimmick to attract people to his business has taken over his life.

Everything in Sevenraj's life is red and white - even his family dress in the colours.

Modelling himself on Mahatmar Ghand, who he says is instantly recognisable in pictures wearing his glasses and a white towel, he has become something of a local sensation in his home city of Bangalore, India.

The only things pictured in Sevenraj's living room that are not red and white are the TV set and DVD player

The repetitive colour scheme could drive many people mad, but not Sevenraj, who is totally obsessed by it

The obsession has become so extreme even toothpaste is only bought in red or white tubes and he and his wife, daughter and son eat from red and white plates, knives and forks - while sitting on red and white seats.

Far from being embarrassed by it, he enjoys the attention and his dream is to become recognisable.

It's certainly working. As well as becoming a local celebrity, he has been interviewed by many news channels and papers curious about his strange colour scheme.

His commitment to the colours red and white is comprehensive and includes any accessory imaginable

Sevenraj even sticks to red tubes of toothpaste and red toothbrushes in his crazy quest to be distinctive

Sevenraj's strange habits extend to an unhealthy preoccupation with the number seven.

His says his father named him after the number as he was the seventh child in his family. He now has seven buttons on his blazer and his telephone number ends in 777.

He also speaks seven languages, including his native Malaysian, Hindi, English, Tamil and Marathi.

The number seven is stitched into the headrest on his car, and proudly displayed on the lapels of his red and white blazer.

His suit, mobile, furniture, office, handkerchief and stationery are all red and white. He dresses entirely in the colours, including his socks.

He said: 'Mahatma Gandhi is recognised by his glasses and bare torso with a white towel, so I had to do something similar to be recognized by one and all.'

Sevenraj's family are now known as the 'Red and White Family' in their hometown of Bangalore
