The teenage sister of a four-year-old boy who drowned in a cruise ship swimming pool has written a heart-wrenching message to her brother, saying: 'I wish I could say I love you one last time.'

Anastassia Brownlee, from Brooklyn, New York, wrote on her Facebook that she did not understand why Dante Curtis had to die on the Norwegian Breakaway as it passed North Carolina on Monday.

'I'm so happy I said I love you to him 
and hugged him when I last saw him,' she wrote. 'But I don't know why god took the baby that I loved so much away from me and my family.

'And as I’m here with tears shedding down my face, I 
just wish I could have him back, and say I love you one last time... There's nothing I want more then to see him right here right now.'

Dante was unresponsive when he was pulled from the pool alongside his six-year-old brother.

An emergency medical team on the ship gave both children CPR and cew members were able to revive the older child but Dante could not be saved.

Coast Guard Petty Officer Adam SanSoucie said the older boy was taken to Carteret General Hospital in Morehead City, North Carolina with his grandmother and a nurse.

Heartfelt: Their sister Anastassia poured out her heart on Facebook about the loss of her brother

They were flown by a Marine rescue helicopter, but staff would not reveal his condition.

Speaking to WNCT, Anastassia identified her brothers as the victims of the tragedy.

'Thank you for your condolences,' she said. 'I'd rather not speak on the situation though at this time. I'll let my parents handle that situation when they're ready.'

The company first shared details of the tragedy on its Facebook page.

'We
 extend our deepest sympathies to the family during this extremely 
difficult time and are providing full assistance and support,' the 
cruise line said on the page.

'The family is in our thoughts and prayers and we ask that you please keep them in your thoughts and prayers as well.'

Devastating: The children were found in an adult pool on board the huge cruise ship on Monday but an investigation is ongoing into who was accompanying them and how the tragedy struck

The incident is being investigated by the FBI because it happened in international waters.

Witnesses aboard the ship, which was traveling to the Bahamas from Manhattan, detailed the tragic turn of events.

'They were drowning and there was water in their lungs,' one witness said. 'They were being resuscitated and water was coming out of their nose and their mouths, and I couldn’t bear to watch.'

The
 Norwegian Cruise Line website describes the 4,000-passenger Norwegian 
Breakaway as the 'newest and largest ship embarking from NYC' to winter 
destinations including the Southern Caribbean, Bahamas and Florida.
