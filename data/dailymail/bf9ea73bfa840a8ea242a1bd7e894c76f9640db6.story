A daredevil duo have become the first to complete Britain's toughest climb - in a gruelling challenge that took an entire day.

Adventurers Tom Randall and Pete Whittaker battled a series of brutal ascents throughout the Peak District almost entirely without ropes.

The pair overcame tiredness, hunger and pain during the day and into the night - and even lost 3.5kg of weight during the 22 hour and 36 minute marathon.

They needed head torches to navigate some of the most technical routes in the UK which involved steep climbs and awkward slopes. 

Their  climb even included almost 24 miles of running between each route - as well as having to eat enough food to provide 6000 calories.

In doing so, they smashed a series of climbing records across the Eastern and Western Peak District areas set by climbers Joe Brown and Don Whillans.

Mr Randall, from Sheffield, said: 'On the surface the climbing appears relatively straight forward with only approximately 6,000ft of ascent.

'But it's the style of the route that really kills you - Brown and Whillans routes seek out the burliest, steepest and most awkward routes on the gritstone edges.

'I felt like I had jelly for arms and it was a reminder skin isn't so tough.

'Add on 23.6 miles of running between crags and routes and trying not to get lost in seven hours of solo climbing done in darkness it was a challenge.'

In 2009 the pair climbed all of the Western Peak District routes taking them 10 hours to climb over 1500ft of rock.

It was then Mr Whittaker came up with the idea of linking two sets of routes together and the challenge was set.

Painful: The pair pushed the boundaries of their physical capabilities as they took on the challenge in the Peak District

Thirsty work: The pair came up with the idea of linking two sets of climbs in one day five years ago and have now made the dream become a reality

Mr Randall added: 'I said to Pete "who's going to actually do that? It's an absolute monster day out".

'Fast forward five years and there I was on a September night at 10pm preparing myself for the unthinkable.

'During the weeks leading up to the attempt we had been out on the edges slowly improving our soloing skills, learning more than 130 pitches of climbing, practicing the approaches and devising our strategy.

'Most importantly we'd worked hard on driving an unstoppable motivation - there was no chance we would get through it without some serious knuckling down and suffering.

'We both went through so many different emotions throughout the whole process.'
