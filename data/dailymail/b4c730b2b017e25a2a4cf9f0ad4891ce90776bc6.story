Ministers are hoping to halt the creep of wind farms across the countryside by offering larger cash incentives to build them at sea.

George Osborne has secured a 5 per cent cut in wind power subsidies amid increasing concerns about the hostility turbines have caused in rural areas, and to head off a revolt by Tory MPs.

But the green levies paid to companies building them off the coast – and out of sight – will increase slightly in the coming years.

Controversial: The turbines have caused hostility in rural areas

It does not mean there will be no new turbines on land, where there are already more than 4,000, but sources close to the Chancellor said that ‘protecting our natural environment’ was a key factor in the decision.

Payments to unpopular large solar farms – but not household solar panels – will also go down.

Treasury chief secretary Danny Alexander said the cuts were due to manufacturing costs falling.

But Renewable UK, which represents the wind industry, warned ministers against making these decisions for ‘political reasons rather than economic ones’ and said some smaller community-led wind farms onshore would be ‘lost’ as a result.

Household bills will not fall as a result of the changes yesterday, as other forms of green energy will now win higher subsidies.

Guy Newey, of the Policy Exchange think-tank: said: ‘We must wean renewable energy off the subsidy drip.’

But
he called for the Government to scrap its target to generate 20 per 
cent of energy from renewables by 2020, as it ‘pushes up bills and means
we aren’t cutting carbon emissions in the cheapest way’.

Providers of green energy are given a 
fixed price for every unit of electricity they generate, and prices for 
the next five years were published yesterday by the Department of Energy
and Climate Change.

The market price for power is around 
£50 per megawatt hour, but the government says they need a subsidy to 
compete with coal and gas.

Onshore
wind, which was due to be paid £100 per megawatt hour (MWh) from next 
year, will now get £95, going down to £90 by 2017-18. Solar farms will 
get £120 per MWh, down from £125. But wind turbines at sea will get £155
per MWh going down to £140 in three years’ time.

'Protecting our natural environment': Ministers hope the changes will mean more wind farms are built at sea

The Department of Energy and  Climate Change said: ‘This will  support the growth of the offshore wind industry.’

Shaun Spiers, of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: ‘Any slowing down in the rate of growth of onshore wind is good news.’

But the TaxPayers’ Alliance said the increase in subsidies for offshore wind – which is more expensive than nuclear power – was a ‘catastrophe for families struggling with their bills.’
