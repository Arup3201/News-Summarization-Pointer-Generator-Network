Ashley Young has admitted he relishes his role as one of the most senior players at Manchester United, helping the younger and newer players integrate into the squad.

Alongside the likes of Michael Carrick, Robin van Persie and Darren Fletcher, Young ranks as one of the most experienced professionals at the club and says he is always on hand to help the younger players.

He told the Inside United magazine: 'Being 29 you start to become one of the more senior players and I felt like that on tour.

'It puts more pressure on you but it's how you deal with that pressure - you want to be there to help the youngsters that are coming through into the first team. 

I think that showed in pre-season how the seniors help the youngsters and also help each other and all talk together on the pitch. We've got one [club] captain but when you're out there on the pitch it's like there is 11.'

The 29-year-old has featured in all three of United's three Premier League games so far and is expected to start again for the Red Devils this weekend as they look to get their season back on track with a win against QPR.
