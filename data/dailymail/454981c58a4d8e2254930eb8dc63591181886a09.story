TV star Ben Fogle has spoken for the first time about the heartache of nearly losing his wife during the birth of his stillborn son.

According to Mr Fogle, his wife Marina left within 20 minutes of death, as she struggled to give birth to their third child, a son who was stillborn at 32 weeks in August. 

The thought of losing his wife, with whom he already has two children, as well as their baby was, he revealed, 'terrifying' and 'unbearable'.

'For her to come within 20 minutes of dying was a huge bolt for me and was so terrifying I can't even explain it. The thought of life without her was unbearable', the 41-year-old   told The Sun newspaper.

The presenter also admitted that the harrowing experience was a reminder of the fragility of life and has made him appreciate every moment with his young family - Ludo, four, and Iona, three.

He described how the son he never had the pleasure of meeting inspires him and motivates him to ensure his children 'enjoy every moment of their life'.

'There's a little boy we never got to know and if there's anything we owe him in getting so close to having met him, and yet so far, it's to live life even more for him,' he told the newspaper:

The father-of-two says that since the ordeal in August, not a day goes by when he doesn't say 'I love you' to his family and says the experience taught him he to never take life  for granted.

The presenter says his philosophy is now to  smile, be happy and to seize opportunity that he possibly can.

Nevertheless, the heart-wrenching experience, which he described as 'a shock in every way', also forced the TV explorer to reevaluate his way of life and seek a simpler existence for his family.

In his new series of New Lives In The Wild, which is back on Channel 5 on Friday at 9pm, he meets people who have quit the rat race for alternative lifestyles, something he aspires to himself.

Next year, he added, he plans to road test a new way of life for his family life in French Polynesia or Patagonia.
