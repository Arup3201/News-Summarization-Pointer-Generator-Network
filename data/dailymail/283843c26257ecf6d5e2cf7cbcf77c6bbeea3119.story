More bungalows should be built for older people to free up bigger homes for families, the new housing minister has declared.

The move would allow couples still living in large properties after their children have left home to downsize without being forced into a ‘retirement home’ or apartment.

And it would put more large homes on the market for couples with children who need the extra space.

Brandon Lewis, who was appointed Minister of State for Housing and Planning in last month’s reshuffle, is urging developers to build more ‘quintessentially British’ bungalows.

In recent years there has been a dramatic drop in the construction of bungalows – partly because builders see larger properties as being more profitable.

Mr Lewis, the Tory MP for Great Yarmouth, said his own family provided a good example of the national need for bungalow building.

He said: ‘My in-laws are in their 70s, pretty fit, mentally really with it; they live in a normal house which they both struggle with.

'They are not ready to move into what they would see as a retirement home, but where they live there is not access to bungalows.

‘We should be looking to love bungalows a little bit more. They are an important part of the mix, particularly if we do say to people like my in-laws, “look, there is somewhere you can move to which is ideal for you without having to go into what you might see as a retirement home.”

Speaking in an interview, he added: ‘In some areas on the outskirts of London you have tons and tons of apartments being built and not enough houses, because not everyone wants to live in an apartment.’

Earlier this year the Government amended guidelines to require council planners in England to set aside a certain number of flats or bungalows for older people.

The move has been prompted by the demands of an ageing population.

By 2021 the number of households is on course to increase by 2.2million. Of that, 1.2million are expected to be households aged 65 years and over.

Currently only 2 per cent of homes in England are bungalows and in 2009 – the most recent available figures – only 300 bungalows were built.

Last year the think tank Policy Exchange urged reform of the planning system to encourage developers to build more bungalows which would be attractive to older people.

It estimated there were 25million spare bedrooms among the older population and this is in part due to lack of available bungalows.

Planning rules which forced developers to build at least 30 dwellings per hectare acted as a disincentive towards new bungalows.

The Policy Exchange report stated: ‘It makes no sense to prevent construction of bungalows if we are interested in increasing the housing supply and a more efficient use of the existing housing stock.’

However, other property experts believe custom-built apartments have replaced the bungalow as the retirement property of choice.

Last week Mr Lewis unveiled a £200million fund to build thousands of new homes on brownfield sites in towns and cities. He said that this could protect greenfield areas from development.

However, the threat of greenfield development remains.

Mr Lewis said that it was important to ‘realise just how much open space we have got,’ although it was local councils who decided on the location of development.
