Turkey has blasted Britain for being too slow to inform it about three London schoolgirls who travelled to Turkey last week possibly en route to join Islamist militants in Syria.

Yesterday, David Cameron announced all teenagers boarding flights to Turkey could be challenged by airlines about whether they plan to join ISIS under new plans.

The Prime Minister told MPs that talks were being held with airlines to alert the police to ensure that 'at risk children are properly identified and questioned'.

It came after three London schoolgirls who are feared to have fled Britain to join ISIS, boarding a flight to Turkey before slipping into neighbouring Syria. 

Turkey's Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Arinc said he hoped the girls would be found, but that it would be Britain, not Turkey, to blame if they were not.

'It is an condemnable act for Britain to let three girls ... come to Istanbul and then let us know three days later .

'They haven't taken the necessary measures,' he said.

The three London schoolgirls arrived at Istanbul airport on February 17 and British authorities, concerned that they were travelling to join Islamic State fighters, informed Ankara on February 20, Arinc said.

Turkey was able to do little to track the movements of three people who had entered as tourists, he said.

'The search is ongoing. It would be great if we can find them. But if we can't, it is not us who will be responsible, but the British.'

Thousands of foreigners from more than 80 countries have joined the ranks of Islamic State and other radical groups in Syria and Iraq, many crossing through Turkey.

Turkey has said it needs more detailed and faster information from Western intelligence agencies to intercept them. 

Yesterday, it emerged that police spoke to Kadiza Sultana, 16, Amira Abase, 15, and Shamima Begum, 15, just months before they disappeared and found 'no evidence' that they had been radicalised

Officers were deployed to the school as part of counter-terrorism and anti-radicalisation measures after another teenage girl from Bethnal Green Academy in east London fled to join ISIS.

Mr Cameron said that measures are in place to stop people with known terror links from travelling, but the latest case of the three girls highlighted problems with unaccompanied teenagers who are not on watch lists.

In a Commons statement, Mr Cameron stressed that stopping travel to join ISIS in Iraq and Syria is 'vital'.

He told MPs: 'When people are known risks, whatever their age, they go on our Border Warnings Index and we can intervene to prevent travel and seize their passports.

'But what this incident has highlighted is the concerning situation where unaccompanied teenagers like these - who are not a known risk - can board a flight to Turkey without necessarily being asked questions by the airline.

'We need new proportionate arrangements with airlines to ensure that these at risk children are properly identified and questioned.

'Whenever there are concerns, police at the border should be alerted so they can use the new temporary passport seizure powers to stop people travelling.'

He revealed Home Secretary Theresa May and Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin will be working with the airlines to bring this about.

It follows concern about differences between airlines on the rules governing children travelling alone on flights.

The latest schoolgirls to go missing are feared to have fled to Syria to become Jihadi brides after being ruthlessly groomed online and 'brainwashed in their bedrooms'.

They walked out of their homes last Tuesday before strolling through security checks at Gatwick Airport and flying to Turkey.

Police fear their goal is to reach the terror stronghold of Raqqa where they face being married off to foreign fighters.

Mr Cameron said: 'All of us have been horrified by the way that British teenagers appear to have been radicalised and duped by this poisonous ideology of Islamist extremism while at home on the internet in their bedrooms.

'They appear to have been induced to join a terrorist group that carries out the most hideous violence and believes girls should be married at nine and women should not leave the home.'

Police spoke to the three British 'jihadi brides' just months before they disappeared and found 'no evidence' that they had been radicalised, it emerged today.

Mark Keary, the headteacher of Bethnal Green Academy in east London - which Kadiza Sultana, 16, Amira Abase, 15, and Shamima Begum, 15, all attended - revealed that police had spoken to the girls last year.

Despite fears that the girls were groomed online, Mr Keary issued a statement today in which he insisted the trio were not radicalised at school.

He said access to Twitter and Facebook through school computers was 'strictly regulated'.

Mr Keary said: 'With such measures in place, police have advised us that there is no evidence that radicalisation of the students took place at the academy.

'From the increasing number of similar news reports around the world, it's clear that this is an international issue that is increasing in severity and it is affecting schools across the country and beyond.

'We are constantly reviewing our safeguarding procedures.'

Shamima, who is thought to be travelling on her sister's passport, was 'following' more than 70 known extremists on Twitter – many of them thought to be ISIS fighters.

At least one of the girls is also thought to have been contacted directly using Twitter by a female ISIS fighter. 

However, despite these accounts being well known, none have been suspended by Twitter bosses.

Mr Cameron said it highlighted the need for social media companies to do more to help the police and security agencies.

He called for greater co-operation over contacts between extremists and those who could be radicalised.

'Internet companies have a social responsibility. And we expect them to live up to it,' the PM said.

The UK government is also stepping up pressure for an EU-wide deal on sharing flight passenger records to track potential jihadists.

It would provide the names of passengers, and details of how tickets were bought and the bank accounts used and who people are travelling with.

Mr Cameron said it would offer 'vital information to help us identify in advance when people are travelling on high risk routes'.

He raised the issue with Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu in December.

However, the European Passenger Name Records directive has stalled in Brussels after a row about human rights.

In the wake of the terror attacks in Paris and Copenhagen, a meeting of the European Council last week agreed that MEPs should urgently adopt a 'strong and effective' European Passenger Name Records directive.

Mr Cameron stressed that tackling the problem was not just an issue for our police and border controls. 

'We do need schools and universities and colleges to put aside concerns about cultural sensitivity or suchlike and really make sure they are doing everything they can to tackle people at risk of radicalisation.

'It is quite similar in some ways to the problem of forced marriage where we have had people disappearing from schools in parts of the country without there being proper ... protection in those schools.

'Indeed it is quite similar to the problem of FGM, but it is on an enormous scale and that is why we need to take such action.'
