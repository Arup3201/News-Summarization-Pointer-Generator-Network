A suspected burglar has been killed and the police officer chasing him has been seriously injured after they were hit by a police car heading to the scene. 

The pair were knocked down by a patrol vehicle near a bike shop - the scene of the alleged break-in - shortly before 2am this morning in Reading, Berkshire.

The car was flashing blue lights in response to a 999 call when it collided with the two men - killing the suspect instantly. 

Scene: Police cordon off Wokingham Road in Reading, Berkshire, where a suspected burglar was knocked down and killed, while an officer was seriously injured

The Independent Police Complaints Commission was called in to assess the scene and is now investigating the incident. 

A spokesman for Thames Valley Police said the officer was taken to the Royal Berkshire Hospital with injuries which are not believed to be life-threatening.

'A police vehicle responding to a report of a burglary in progress was involved in a collision with a member of the public, a man, and a police officer,' said the spokesman. 

'The incident has been referred to the Independent Police Complaints Commission,' the spokesman added. 

One man living on Eastern Avenue, the scene of the alleged burglary, said he heard banging coming from the building across the road before hearing people running in the build-up to the crash. 

Witnesses said there were two men on the roof of the bike shop, called the Berkshire Cycle Company, trying to get in.

However police have not confirmed whether they are searching for another suspect.  

Road closures were put up on streets surrounding the incident so the incident could be investigated.

The A329 Wokingham Road between Hamilton Road and the main A4 London Road in the town centre was blocked off to traffic. 

Aftermath: A blue forensic tent was seen covering the body this morning as an investigation was launched 

Taken away: The patrol car, which was on its way to the scene of the alleged burglary, was taken away on the back of a recovery lorry this morning 

A blue police tent was set up at the scene and was believed to be covering the body of the dead man.

Police said that they were still trying to find relatives of the victim before he can be identified. 

The body of the man was removed from the scene in a private ambulance earlier this morning and was escorted from the scene by another patrol car. 

At the same time the police car involved in the fatal crash, a silver-coured marked Volvo estate vehicle, was taken away on the back of a flatbed recovery truck at the other end of the street.

There was no visible damage on the robust police car. 

Probe: The Independent Police Complaints Commission was called to the site and will assess whether an investigation will begin
