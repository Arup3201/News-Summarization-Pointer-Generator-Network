Senior content producer of beautyheaven Olivia Mackinnon told Daily Mail Australia why some of the winning products were favoured.

Best Hair Treatment - Moroccanoil Original Treatment

‘I’m a big fan of the Moroccanoil Original Treatment because it’s the best treatment for hair,’ she said.

'It’s great to use as a damp in conditioner when you’re out of the shower to give your hair feeling soft and nourished.

‘It’s easy and versatile to use and you can mix it with other products. I usually mix mine with gel.’

Best Foundation - Estée Lauder Double Wear Stay-In-Place Makeup

‘The best thing about this foundation is it’s a semi matte liquid foundation for oily skin to give you that hint of radiant and sleek look,’ she said.

‘It controls oil and it’s definitely another one that’s getting a cult status because there’s a huge following behind it.

Best Mascara - Benefit They’re Real Mascara

‘The Benefit They’re Real Mascara is a front runner because it has won the same award from last year,' she said.

It’s an innovative mascara that gives that false lash effect and it’s under $40 so people find it reasonable.

Best Lipstick - YSL Rouge Pur Couture Lipstick

‘It has a beautiful gold casing and some of our reviews have said you don’t need to reapply because it lasts long,' she said.

‘We know what works,' said Olivia.

'These products were judged upon what was consistently reliable after gathering a cult status from our beautyheaven members.'

beautyheaven members voted over 2000 times for the products they loved, ensuring that the beauty essentials were ones that worked well and were used across a wide range of customers.

‘There was a real mix of winners across all categories where we were able to find the higher end products and brands that have been successful over the year,' she said. 

‘The awards are about establishing and rewarding cult products, so it makes sense that some of the winners are those that have made their way into the hands and hearts of consumers and win time and time again,’ she said.

‘It helps men and women across Australia determine the crème-de-la-crème of what is out there, discovering the hidden beauty essentials of others along the way!’

Among the product winners for 2014 were a few familiar brands, holding onto their titles from last year.

This was the case for Benefit Hoola as Best Bronzer and ghd eclipse as Best Straightener.

‘The Maybelline tattoo liquid eyeshadow was really popular and won an award two years in a row. It’s different to other eyeshadows because it gives incredible pigment to eyelids,' Olivia said.

For the best beauty advice, Olivia said that one of the best tips she had come across was to find a celebrity with similar resemblance to yourself for inspiration.

‘Find a celebrity who has the same skin tone or similar facial features to you,' she said.

‘I look at Leighton Meester and if I see her on the Red Carpet rocking blue eye-liner, I’d feel confident that I could pull that off too. Beauty muse is really helpful.'

‘Something else I was told a long time ago is to be cautious of what you’re putting in your hair.

‘Don’t overload with hair products because less is more in what I use and these products are designed to last. Too much protein can make it stiff and can’t move in the wind. 

Olivia said that for all conditioners, especially the three-minute hair treatments, are best left on as long as possible to get the best benefits and allow enough time for nutrients to penetrate the hair.

'You need to leave them on for at least 10 minutes to work because you're basically washing your hair mask down the sink,' she said. 

'My advice is to leave it in your hair as long as you can – while you’re vacuuming or running some errands around the house before rinsing.'

Australia’s beauty experts have made it their mission to find the best beauty products that’ll make you look and feel amazing

It's not all about the new and improved though, with a few classics remaining a necessity for any beauty-lover.  

'Red lipstick will never go out of style. There are so many different shades of red, including pink, coral and orange,' she said.

'I think every girl would suit one of these colours and it makes you look classy and it's the perfect way to lift you up.'

Benefit and Garnier swept up the most awards with three products each in the make-up, skincare and hair categories.
