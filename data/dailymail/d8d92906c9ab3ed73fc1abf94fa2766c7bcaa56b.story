As the bride twirls around on the dancefloor with her father the scene looks like an emotional, but conventional wedding moment. 

But this traditional father/daughter dance has a poignant difference... the father is dying from pancreatic cancer and  granted his daughter's wish to pre-record their first dance, so that she can watch it at her wedding when he has passed away.

Dr James Wolf, from Auburn, California, was recently told that he has just four to six months to live, so Rachel, 25, quickly set about making the arrangements, even though she is not engaged to be married.

One last dance: As the bride Rachel Wolf twirled around on the dance floor with her father it looked like an emotional moment from a wedding

'I just was flabbergasted,' Dr. Wolf told TODAY.

'There are a lot of things that I would've liked the girls to experience with me being there,' Dr. Wolf admitted.

'And I'm not going to be there.'

Members of the Auburn community who 
heard about Miss Wolf's idea donated a wedding dress, a DJ, a 
tuxedo for Dr Wolf, a limousine, a hairstylist, a professional 
photographer, and a gazebo for the event.

Strength: Dr Wolf had only been in his hospital bed a few hours earlier

Preparations: Dr Wolf puts his tuxedo on before the 'wedding'

Although Dr. Wolf is currently going 
through chemotherapy he was determined to take part and was filmed 
getting his tuxedo on, although he looked weak and needed help.

The white limo drew up at 7pm and Miss Wolf stepped out wearing a white strapless wedding dress, helped by two bridesmaids.

Seeing his daughter, Dr Wolf called out 'Hi honey!'  'You look gorgeous!'

She replied happily 'Thanks Daddy!'

The
crowd, which included Jeanine, Miss Wolf's  sister Lauren, and a group of 
Dr. Wolf's patients, clapped as the pair walked across the grass for 
their dance at the gazebo.

The smiling pair stepped on to the dancefloor as 'Cinderella' by Steven Curtis Chapman began to play.

Big moment: Dr Wolf and his daughter walk across the grass to take their place for the traditional father/daughter dance

First dance: Members of the Auburn community who heard about Miss Wolf's idea have donated a wedding dress, a DJ, a tuxedo for Dr Wolf, a limousine, a hairstylist, a professional photographer, and a gazebo

Determined: Although Dr. Wolf is currently going through chemotherapy he was determined to dance the night away

Emotional: Dr. Wolf twirled his daughter as they swayed in time to the music, although at one point she began to break down and put her face into his chest

Entrance: The crowd, which included his wife Jeanine, Rachel's sister Lauren, and a group of Dr. Wolf's patients, clapped as the pair walked across the grass

Dr. Wolf twirled his daughter as they swayed in time to the music, although at one point she began to break down and put her face into his chest.

Although Dr Wolf had only been lying in a hospital a few hours earlier the dance continued after the music ended and he danced with his other daughter and his wife. 

'I'm saddened over the fact that I won't be there for the events of her life,' he told News 10, choking back tears. 'That's been difficult on me.'

'I
just thought, if I get the dress and record it, I can have it for 
whoever,' she explained, adding: 'I don't want to regret one 
day that I could have done it.'

A News10 video shows Miss Wolf asking her father to grant her final wish.

Rachel made a special invitation to her hypothetical wedding, and 
presented it to Dr Wolf when he met her in the doorway.

Special bond: 'He's always been my hero,' she says. 'He's pretty much everyone's hero because he's a doctor. But he's mine, he's the best'

'My greatest sadness of you not being here is that you won't get to walk me down the aisle, or have a special father daughter dance,' she tells him.

'So I'm inviting you to my 'wedding,'' she says, handing him the card.

Visibly moved, Dr Wolf nods and agrees to make the video.

'My whole life has been dedicated to trying to make a difference,' Dr Wolf explains in the interview.

'And I would like to leave that to them,' he says of his children.

His legacy is not lost on Miss Wolf, who embraces him several times during the video. 'He's always been my hero,' she says.

'He's pretty much everyone's hero because he's a doctor. But he's mine, he's the best.'
