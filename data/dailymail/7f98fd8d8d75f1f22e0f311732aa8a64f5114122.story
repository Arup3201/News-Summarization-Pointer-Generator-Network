Singer Nik Kershaw has revealed how he made millions of pounds from just four of his songs from the 1980s and 90s.

The 56-year-old said he has been able to put his children through university and private school thanks to the hits which include 'The Riddle', 'Wouldn't it be Good' and 'I Won't Let the Sun go Down on Me'.

He also confirmed he received 'huge' royalties from the 1991 chart topper 'The One and Only', which  was performed by Chesney Hawkes.

But the musician revealed his worst business investment was buying a mansion in Ireland with five partners. 

He told the Sunday Telegraph how he bought the 'massive' house, which once belonged to Noel Redding, the bassist for Jimi Hendrix, in 2005.

They sold the property at the start of this year for a third of the purchase price - and he lost £150,000, he revealed.

He said in the interview that receiving royalties for his songs, including 'The One and Only', was 'like having a pension'.

He said: 'That song has made me millions of pounds over the years, along with The Riddle, Wouldn't it be Good and I Won't Let the Sun go Down on Me. 

'It's put my kids through university and private school.' 

The One and Only spent five weeks at number one in the singles chart in March and April 1991.

In the early 1980s, his hit 'I Won't Let The Sun Go Down On Me' soared to number two having been re-released and became a major hit in a number of other countries. 

The same album, 'Human Racing', yielded 'Wouldn't it be Good' and spent three weeks at number four in the charts.

The Riddle, a song from his album of the same name, reached number three in 1984. 

Kershaw, whose tour 'Me Myself and I' runs until October 12, said he once bought a Porsche Boxster but that he 'felt such a prat getting in and out of it that I sold it soon after' and replaced it with a Volvo.

When asked whether money made him happy, he replied, 'no', but added it can help take stress away and provide for your family.

Talking about his favourite charities, he said he backs the Down's Syndrome Association as his son has the condition while he also supports the cancer charity Macmillian. 

The singer added a recent surge in interest in the Eighties has helped things along. 

'At the end of the Nineties when royalties were drying up and my new stuff wasn't getting recorded or covered by other artists, it was looking dodgy.

'But over the last 15 years it’s got better and better, maybe because of the Eighties revival.’
