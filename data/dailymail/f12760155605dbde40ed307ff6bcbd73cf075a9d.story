Dianne Howell was told she needed physiotherapy due to poor posture. Pictured with her son, Luke O'Reilly, the 61-year-old died of pancreatic cancer months after first visiting doctors

For eight months, Diane Howell suffered severe back and stomach pain. 

Doctors told her she needed physio for poor posture and so the mother of one struggled on in her shop job.

Only after 15 consultations was she referred to a specialist. 

By then the pain had got so intolerable she was rushed to hospital, where it finally emerged that she had pancreatic cancer. She died three months later.

Now her family say she was showing classic symptoms of the disease and it should have been spotted by doctors far sooner.

Her son Luke O’Reilly has made a formal complaint against the medical centre that treated her.

Miss Howell’s pain began in January and her medical records show she visited Lombard Medical Centre in Newark, Nottinghamshire, at least 15 times between April and August, seeing five different doctors as her condition deteriorated. 

The centre sent Miss Howell for tests, including a chest X-ray and renal ultrasound that tested her kidneys. Her bladder, uterus and abdominal aorta were also tested. She underwent a breast neoplasm screening, which her medical records show was normal.

She was finally referred to a colorectal surgeon after a visit to the surgery in August, with an appointment for 12 days’ time.

But her pain got so bad that her son had to take her to hospital before the appointment.

She was admitted to King’s Mill Hospital, Sutton-in-Ashfield, and six days later was told she had metastatic pancreatic cancer.

Following the diagnosis, Mr O’Reilly, 28, began researching the condition on the internet.

He said: ‘When I typed my mother’s 
symptoms into Google one of the first diagnoses is pancreatic cancer.

'
I’m not naive and I’m not suggesting that anyone can be diagnosed by 
looking at Google, but the symptoms were obvious. Mum lost 2½-stone in 
five months.’

The cancer had
 spread to her liver, lungs, and spleen, and she died at Beaumond House 
Community Hospice in her home town of Newark on November 19.

Mr O’Reilly said if his mother’s 
condition had been diagnosed earlier he could have spent her last few 
months fulfilling her final wishes and she may have even survived long 
enough for them to spend this Christmas together.

‘I could have taken her on trips so she could do the things she wanted to do,’ he said. 

‘I may have been able to spend Christmas with her, but for the first time in 28 years I wasn’t with her at Christmas.’

Miss Howell separated from her son’s father when he was a child and Mr O’Reilly senior remains in regular contact with his son.

She
 worked for more than 20 years on the shop floor at discount chain 
Wilkinson and was signed off with pain shortly before her diagnosis.

Metastatic pancreatic cancer means the disease spreads through the bloodstream to other organs. It is usually terminal so treatment focuses on pain relief.

Dr Andrew Parkin, a senior partner at Lombard Medical Centre, said he was sorry to learn of Miss Howell’s death but he can’t comment on individual cases.

Dr Mark Jefford, of NHS Newark and Sherwood Clinical Commissioning Group, said: ‘Anyone with any issues about the quality of care they get from any of our health providers should discuss their specific concerns with the provider involved as soon as possible.’
