Jessica Leigh, from Rochester, Kent had always been tormented for the shape of her nose but now claims that her bullies have made her more beautiful.

Jessica has changed her life around and beaten her bullies after having a nose job

Jessica says that the constant goading made her lose all of her self-esteem. 

'I had spent all my life feeling like the ugly duckling, I was bullied throughout school because of my big nose.

'I was constantly picked on by the popular girls at school, I was made to feel different and gradually my confidence disappeared.

'Even when I left school and started college, the bullying continued.' 

For Jessica the shape of her nose had not only resulted in vicious teasing but had also stood in the way of her dream career with the 20-year-old quitting her modelling job as she didn't feel pretty enough.

Jessica finally decided to go in for surgery after having breathing difficulty in a yoga class

After finally building up the confidence to pursue her modelling career after years of teasing, it was seeing her head shots that bought Jessica's confidence to an all time low.

'My modelling dreams were crushed when I saw a photograph of my side profile. I knew I wouldn't make it in the modelling world with a nose like mine, so I gave it all up.

'It hit me like a tonne of bricks, my confidence plummeted after that.'

Despite having considered corrective surgery her whole life, Jessica didn't turn to it until a Yoga class confirmed what she saw as the necessity of the procedure.  

'I was taking lessons in how to teach yoga when I realised that I couldn't breathe properly.

'The one side of my nose had a defect that meant I couldn't pass as much oxygen through it when breathing out.'

With her decision made Jessica booked her rhinoplasty.

This was not a decision that Jessica made lightly and after years of consideration she was careful to do plenty of research before settling on a surgeon. 

Jessica began researching cosmetic clinics online in January, attending seven consultations before choosing MYA.

The surgery was not cheap costing Jessica £3,500, but the 20-year-old was determined to fund the procedure herself paying half up front, with the rest being on finance.

Despite, the hefty price Jessica was satisfied with her decision and felt as though she was in good hands. 

'MYA were by far the best and I booked my Rhinoplasty there and then in March for July10.

'I gave myself a few months to prepare for surgery as I had a few holidays booked beforehand.'

She was so thrilled with the results and couldn't wait to show off her new nose.

'I am like a completely different person since my surgery.

'I smile more and I can honestly say I'm a happier person.'

It isn't surprising that Jessica is happier than ever, with her boyfriend Kev Pender, 27, recently proposing.
