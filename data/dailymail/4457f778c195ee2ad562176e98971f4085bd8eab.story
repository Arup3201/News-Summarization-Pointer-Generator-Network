Searching for help, President Barack 
Obama lobbied the skeptical leaders of Russia and China on Saturday for 
support in keeping Iran from becoming a nuclear-armed menace to the 
world, hoping to yield a 'common response' to a crisis that is testing 
international unity.

Yet Obama's talk of solidarity with 
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Chinese President Hu Jintao was 
not publicly echoed by either man as Iran moved anew to the fore of the 
international stage -- and to the front of the fierce U.S. presidential 
race.

Obama, at home in Hawaii and holding 
forth on a world stage, also sought to show aggressiveness in fixing an 
economy that has weakened his standing with voters.

He pushed Hu about American impatience
with China's economic policy, touted the makings of a new pacific trade
zone and showered attention on the lucrative Asia-Pacific export 
market.

The United States' vast worries about 
Iran grew starker with a report this week by the U.N. atomic agency that
asserted in the strongest terms yet Iran is conducting secret work with
the sole intent of developing nuclear arms.

The U.S. claims a nuclear-armed Iran could set off an arms race among rival states and directly threaten Israel.

Last month Israel informed Obama of no guarantees a strike against Iran would be notified in advance to the U.S., suggesting the country feels it no longer needs Washington's permission, a source briefed on the meeting told the Telegraph.

'They did not suggest that military action was being planned or was imminent, 
but neither did they give any assurances that Israel would first seek 
Washington's permission, or even inform the White House in advance that a 
mission was underway,' a source told the Telegraph.

The Israeli decision shows a dampening confidence in a diplomatic solution by the state, as Russia and China remain a roadblock to the United States in its push to tighten international sanctions on Iran.

Both are veto-wielding members of the U.N. Security Council and have shown no sign the new report will change their stand.

With Medvedev on the sidelines of an 
Asia-Pacific summit here, Obama said the two 'reaffirmed our intention 
to work to shape a common response' on Iran.

Shortly after, Obama joined Hu, in a 
run of back-to-back diplomacy with the heads of two allies that hold 
complicated and at times divisive relations with the United States. 
Obama said that he and the Chinese leader want to ensure that Iran 
abides by 'international rules and norms.'

Obama's comments were broad enough to portray a united front without yielding any clear indication of progress.

Medvedev, for his part, was largely 
silent on Iran during his remarks, merely acknowledging that the subject
was discussed. Hu did not mention Iran at all.

White House aides insisted later that 
Russia and China remain unified with the United States and other allies 
in preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, and that Obama, Hu 
and Medvedev had agreed to work on the next steps.

Deputy national security adviser Ben 
Rhodes said the new allegations about Iran's programs demand an 
international response, and 'I think the Russians and the Chinese 
understand that. We're going to be working with them to formulate that 
response.'

As the president held forth on the 
world stage in his home state, Republicans vying to compete against 
Obama for the presidency unleashed withering criticism in a 'Commander-in-Chief Debate' held in 
South Carolina.

On the defense: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (center) addressed the IAEA report in a cabinet meeting saying it strengthens claims that Iran is developing nuclear weapons

It was a rare moment in which foreign policy garnered attention in a campaign dominated by the flagging U.S. economy.

'If we re-elect Barack Obama, Iran 
will have a nuclear weapon. And if you elect Mitt Romney, Iran will not 
have a nuclear weapon,' said Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor.

Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann warned
that Iran's attempt to develop a nuclear weapon is setting the table 
'for worldwide nuclear war against Israel.'

In competing plans by the presidential candidates, Rival Herman Cain says he would not use military action but 
says he would move warships to the region to deter Iran.

Instead, Mr Cain says he 
would prefer to aid the resistance to Tehran to overthrow the regime.

Candidates' debate: The 'Commander-in-Chief Debate' Saturday was the first foreign policy debate by the U.S. GOP candidates

Iraq: Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul likened the U.S.' handling of Iran to 'the war propaganda that went on against Iraq.'

And rival Ron Paul, a congressman from Texas, says any use 
of force against Iran would require approval from Congress, adding,

'I'm afraid what's going on right now is similar to the war propaganda that 
went on against Iraq.'

Iran has insisted its nuclear work is in the peaceful pursuit of energy and research, not weaponry.

U.S. officials have said the report by
the International Atomic Energy Agency was unlikely to persuade China 
and Russia to support tougher sanctions on the Iranian government.

But led by Obama, the administration 
is still trying to mount pressure on Iran, both through the United 
Nations and its own, for fear of what may come should Iran proceed 
undeterred.

Financial pressure: Texas Governor Rick Perry suggested a form of pressure to foreign countries would be scrapping their foreign aid to zero dollars and negotiating up from there

In a suggested form of pressure by Mr Perry at Saturday's debate, he proposed a cut to foreign aid to send 'a clear message to every country.'

'...the foreign aid budget in my administration for every country is gonna start at zero dollars. Zero dollars. And then we'll have a conversation,' Mr Perry said.

More broadly, Obama sought Saturday to
position the United States as a Pacific power, creating more 
American jobs by tapping the explosive potential of the Asia-Pacific.

For businesses, he said, 'this is where the action's going to be.'

'There is no region in the world that 
we consider more vital than the Asia-Pacific region,' he told chief 
executives gathered for a regional economic summit.

The president went so far as to saying
the United States had grown 'a little bit lazy' in trying to attract 
business to the United States.

Obama's aides said he was blunt with 
Hu in expressing concern about China's undervalued currency, which keeps
its exports cheaper and U.S. exports to China more expensive.

Deputy National Security Adviser Mike 
Froman said Obama made it clear that Americans are growing 'increasingly
impatient and frustrated' with the state of change in China economic 
policy.

China had a $273 billion trade surplus
with the U.S. last year and U.S. lawmakers say the imbalance hurts 
American manufacturers and taken away American jobs.

Underscoring the search for some good 
economic news ahead heading toward a re-election vote, Obama announced 
the broad outlines of an agreement to create a transpacific trade zone 
encompassing the United States and eight other nations.

He said details must still be worked out, but said the goal was to complete the deal by next year.

'The United States is a Pacific power and we're here to stay,' Obama said.

The eight countries joining the U.S. 
in the zone would be Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, 
Peru, Singapore and Vietnam.

Obama also spoke with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda about Japan's interest in joining the trade bloc.

In a sign of potential tension with 
China, Froman shrugged off complaints from China that it had not been 
invited to join the trade bloc.

He told reporters that China had not 
expressed interest in joining and said the trade group 'is not something
that one gets invited to. It's something that one aspires to.'

Addressing the European debt crisis, 
Obama said he welcomed the new governments being formed in Greece and 
Italy, saying they should help calm world financial markets.

Obama's ever increasing attention to 
the Asia-Pacific is driven in part by Europe's own financial woes and 
the U.S. need to get more aggressive in tapping its export options.

Obama will be in Honolulu through Tuesday, when he leaves for Australia before ending his trip in Indonesia.
