Seeking to avoid a
repeat of Facebook's much-maligned public debut, Twitter revealed more modest ambitions on Thursday, saying its initial public 
offering would raise up to $1.6 billion and value the company at up to 
$10.9 billion.

The valuation was far more conservative than the $15 billion that some analysts had expected for the social media phenomenon.

Twitter,
which has signaled for weeks that it would price its IPO conservatively
to avoid the stock drop that marred Facebook's offering, said that it 
intends to sell 70 million shares priced between $17 and $20.

Twitter is expected to set the price on November 
6, according to a document seen by Reuters, suggesting that the 
stock could begin trading as early as November 7.

The tech-company hopes to raise between $1.25 billion and $1.44 billion, according to an amended version of its prospectus filed on Thursday.

Twitter said on Thursday that there will be 544,696,816 shares of its common stock outstanding after the offering.

The company and its underwriters will begin a 
two-week road show on October 28 in New York and will stop in Boston and
the mid-Atlantic region before touching down in Chicago, San Francisco,
Los Angeles and Denver, according to a source familiar with the 
offering.

'It's conservative and likely going to be raised as they start the road show at least once if not twice,' Sam Hamadeh of PrivCo, a private company research firm, said of Twitter's pricing.

'The size of the offering is also a bit small,' he added. 'But they may only choose to raise the price once they gauge investor demand. Raising both the price and the size was Facebook's fatal mistake.'

Facebook aggressively raised its price in the days leading up to its IPO and when it hit the market, it tanked dramatically - at one stage losing half its value.

An investigation was launched into the public offering and it is significant that Twitter has chosen to launch on New York Stock Exchange and not on Nasdaq.

The IPO is one of the most highly anticipated IPOs in tech history with Twitter the last of the major social networking sites to go public.

It comes after Facebook floated on the US stock market in May 2012 for $104 billion and, despite seeing an initial slump in shares, has since had a resurgence.

It is thought that like Facebook, Twitter bosses' hands were forced by the Jobs Act which requires a U.S firm to file an IPO once it has reached 2,000 investors.

Although the IPO was filed confidentially - the law allows companies with less than $1billion revenue in its last financial year to do so - the company was quick to announce its intentions, naturally, with a tweet in September.

The company has been ramping up its advertising products and working to boost ad revenue in preparation.

But it is still small in comparison to Facebook, which saw its highly anticipated IPO implode last year amid worries about its ability to grow mobile ad revenue.

The decision to float the company is likely to see the company's founders Jack Dorsey, Evan Williams and Biz Stone stand to gain huge financial windfalls.

The site was founded in March 2006 but has become one of the world's most popular social networking sites over the past seven years.

Dorsey introduced the world to the site by sending out the first ever tweet which read: 'Just setting up my twttr'.

Age: 41

Net worth: $1 - $2billion

Potential worth: $3billion

CNN Money estimated that he has a 12 per cent share in the company. His firms have also founded Blogger and Medium.

Williams, a vegetarian, lives in the San Francisco Bay area with his wife Sara Morishige and the pair have two children.

Jack Dorsey

Age: 36

Net worth: $1.1billion

Potential worth: $1.6 billion

Mr Dorsey sent the first ever tweet in March 2006 and is thought to own a 10 per cent share in the company.

Although he made his name with Twitter, most of his current fortune is thought to have been amassed through his estimated 25 per cent stake in mobile payment start up Square.

He is a certified masseur and lives in San Francisco.

Biz Stone

Age: 39

Net worth: Thought to be around $200million

Potential worth: Around $2billion

As well as Twitter, Stone, full name Christopher Isaac, helped to create and launch Xanga, Blogger, Odeo and Medium.

He is also CEO of a 2012 start-up called Jelly Industries, thought to be a mobile app.

He has written two books on blogging and made his directorial debut as part of Project Imaginat10n with Ron Howard.

The 36-year-old is also the founder and CEO of Square, a mobile payments company. He is reportedly living in a $10 million home in San Francisco and dating his longtime girlfriend, Kate Greer.

Dorsey's interest in programming began at the ripe age of eight, according to a 2011 Vanity Fair article. He came up with the idea for Twitter in his 20s and shared it with Biz Stone and Evan Williams, two of his bosses at San Francisco software startup Odeo.

Williams embraced the idea and made Dorsey, who was 29 at the time, the founding CEO of the new company.

Stone, 39, and Williams, 41, have also helped create Blogger, Medium, and a host of other Internet ventures.

Dorsey is currently thought to be worth around $1.1billion but the floatation could see that figure increase by another half a billion.

Others that stand to gain from Twitter going public include early investors Union Square Ventures, Charles River Ventures and Spark Capital, as well as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen, Ron Conway and Naval Ravikant.

In May of last year, Facebook priced its IPO in May 2012 at $38 per share, but the stock fell almost immediately, trading well below its launch price.

The stock continued to fall over the next couple months, trading at $22 per share by September 2012.

A year later, however, share prices have made a full recovery.

Twitter's valuation is relatively conservative — some analysts had 
expected the figure to be as high as $20 billion. Back in August Twitter
priced some of its employee stock options at $20.62.

The caution shows that Twitter learned from Facebook's rocky initial 
public offering last year. Rather than set expectations too high, 
Twitter is playing it safe and will very likely raise its price range 
closer to the IPO, and thus fuel demand.

Twitter's smaller IPO seems to suggest that Silicon Valley has learned the lessons of Facebook's IPO, 
which was marred by technical glitches on the Nasdaq stock exchange in 
May of 2012.

Those problems likely led Twitter to the New York Stock 
Exchange.

The
San Francisco-based short-messaging service, which has roughly 230 
million active users, has said it plans to list its stock under the 
'TWTR' symbol on the New York Stock Exchange.

The eight-year-old company more than doubled its third-quarter revenue to $168.6 million, but net losses widened to $64.6 million in the September quarter.

Earlier this week, the company revealed in a regulatory filing that 
it has obtained a $1 billion credit line to give it more financial 
flexibility going into the IPO.

Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, 
JP Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank were 
involved in arranging the credit deal, Reuters reported earlier. The 
banks are also underwriters of Twitter's IPO. 

No amounts have been drawn under the credit facility, Twitter said.

Twitter was created back in March 2006 but its popularity soon went through the roof with more than 500 million users registered worldwide as of last year and more than 500 million tweets sent a day. Here is a list of interesting facts about what makes Twitter a global phenomenon:
