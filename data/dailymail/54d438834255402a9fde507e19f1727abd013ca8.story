Three female lawyers have reportedly been executed by Islamic State militants as the UN warns that educated women in Iraq are especially at risk.

Today, the UN human rights office condemned numerous executions of civilians in the country by ISIS and said the jihadist group is showing a 'monstrous disregard for human life'.

ISIS, which controls large swathes of territory in Iraq and in neighbouring war-ravaged Syria, last week published pictures of the crucifixions of two men accused of being bandits, and of a woman being stoned to death, allegedly for adultery.

Other women have also reportedly been executed recently in ISIS-controlled areas, including Mosul, UN spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani said.

'Educated, professional women, particularly women who have run as candidates in elections for public office, seem to be particularly at risk,' she said.

'In just the first two weeks of this year, reports indicate that three female lawyers were executed.'

A number of other groups are also targeted by the jihadists, Shamdasani said, referring to 'the ruthless murder of two men, who were thrown off the top of a building after having been accused of homosexual acts by a so-called court in Mosul'.

ISIS released a video showing the two men being thrown off the top of a tower block in Raqqa, Syria, for being gay.

A masked Islamic State fighter announced the charges against the accused using a small handheld radio, before declaring them guilty of engaging in homosexual activities.

He said they should be punished by death, in accordance with Islamic State's radical interpretation of Sharia law.

The men were then bound and blindfolded before being pushed off the 100ft tower block to their deaths.

Back on the ground, men accused of banditry hung from the crosses in agony as their wrists were tightly bound with yellow and green ribbon

Down on the ground, two men accused of banditry have been tied to makeshift metal crosses.

Strung up tightly with yellow and green ribbon around their wrists, the men were hanged from the crosses, wincing in agony’. 

And it's believed the ISIS militants killed three of at least 15 pigeon breeders in Iraq after deciding it is against Islamic religion to keep birds this week.

The extremists also executed 13 teenage boys for watching the Asian Cup football match between Iraq and Jordan last week.

The young football fans had been caught watching the game on television in the Iraqi city of Mosul, which is controlled by the Islamic State.

The teenagers were rounded up and publicly executed by a firing squad using machine guns, according to anti-ISIS activist group Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently.

The small activist group said the teenagers were rounded up by militants in the Al-Yarmouk district of Mosul after 'breaking religious laws' by watching football. 

Images also emerged of a woman, dressed in a black burqa, being stoned to death by a horde of ISIS militants. 

But minorities are not the only ones suffering, with the jihadists meting out 'cruel and inhuman punishments' to anyone accused of violating its 'extremist interpretations of Islamic Sharia law, or for suspected disloyalty,' Shamdasani said.

Four doctors were recently killed in central Mosul, allegedly after refusing to treat ISIS fighters.

The group also reportedly executed 15 civilians in front of a large crowd in Fallujah on January 1, on suspicion they had cooperated with Iraqi security forces, and 14 more in a public square in Dour, north of Tikrit, for refusing to pledge allegiance to ISIS, Shamdasani said.
