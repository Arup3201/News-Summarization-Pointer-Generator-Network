You would think the point of a ‘race’ is to try to come first.

But not if you’re entering this year’s ‘four-legged’ and wheelbarrow events at a Wiltshire village carnival - which have been hit by health and safety edicts.

The four-legged race through the village of Pewsey - which sees teams of three competitors tying a leg to each other - has traditionally involved pit-stops at four pubs.

Changes to the 2003 Licensing Act means that competitors in the races are not allowed alcoholic refreshments

But this year those trying to win the race will have to go teetotal if - according to police - they don’t want to fall foul of the Licensing Act, which bans the drinking of alcohol ‘at speed’.

The organisers of Thursday’s event have decided that they are going to stay in line with the law to avoid the risk of prosecution, so competitors will have to stick to water or a soft drink.

Those entering the wheelbarrow race the following Thursday will have to obey the same restrictions as they pass by the four pubs.

But entrants for both events will be able to stop for as many drinks as they want, downed at whatever speed they wish, if they pledge to complete the course very slowly.

‘The races have been going for 33 years and we’ve only had one person fall out of a wheelbarrow which isn’t bad going,' said a local councillor 

The snail’s pace events will start five minutes after the teetotal races.

The drinking ban has angered some residents in the close-knit community where the two-week-long carnival has been going on for generations without any trouble.

Jerry Kunkler, a Wiltshire Councillor and landlord of the village’s Moonrakers pub, said “It’s all to do with health and safety which I don’t always agree with.

‘We live in a nanny state and it’s the minority that the rules are in place for and the majority are the ones that have to pay.

‘The races have been going for 33 years and we’ve only had one person fall out of a wheelbarrow which isn’t bad going.”

Organisers said on their website that the new rules had been drawn up for this year’s races following a meeting with Wilshire Police, Wiltshire Police Licensing Officer and Wiltshire Council.

The new stance has taken its lead from changes in 2009 to the 2003 Licensing Act which bans ‘irresponsible promotions’.

In particular, they bar ‘any game or activity characterised by the consumption of alcohol at speed or within a prescribed time limit’.

The regulations are aimed at discouraging promotions such as those involving downing ‘shots’ in club or pub contests.

But the carnival race organisers were worried that with competitors charging along the streets, stopping frequently to down booze as onlookers cheered them on, he event could lay itself open to contravening the new laws.

Organiser David Major said ‘It’s been a bit of a nightmare but we’ll just have to see how things go.

‘The changes have been coming in slowly of a period of years and we’ve just had to make this change to comply with the law.

Where are you all coming from? We know where they are not going... to the pub, at least nor during the races

‘We won’t know how it will affect entries until the day, but people have been talking about it, so hopefully everyone will still get into the spirit of things.’

Wiltshire police sergeant Vince Louge said ‘The races in the last few years have been extremely well run and there have been little, if any, problems.

‘The new rules are there simply to comply with new licensing laws and obviously we support that and the organisers have been very flexible in accommodating the changes.’
