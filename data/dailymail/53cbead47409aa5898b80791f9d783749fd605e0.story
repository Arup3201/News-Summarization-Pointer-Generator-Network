A glamour model who missed probation meetings to get a boob job has revealed she has been arrested 25 times - and claims she isn't scared of spending a night in a cell as she knows she will get out the next day.

Sophie Dalzell, 20, hit the headlines earlier this month when she missed two probation meetings to get breast enlargement surgery in Brussels.

The model, who previously refused to wear an electronic tag as it interfered with her adult TV work, today sensationally claimed she's not scared of spending the night in a police cell as she knows she will soon be released.

Sophie Dalzell, says she has been arrested 25 times - and that she isn't scared of spending a night in a cell as she will be 'let out the next day'

The model - who claims she is often attacked for her looks - told a magazine today she 'never walks away' from a fight' and that she 'has the right to defend' herself.

Speaking with Closer Magazine, Miss Dalzell said: 'I will never walk away from a fight. If someone starts on me, I have got a right to defend myself..

'It is usually girls I have trouble with. They make b***** comments about my appearance.

'I pull their hair and scratch their faces. It has become normal for a night out to end in a fight.'

Miss
 Dalzell, originally from Workington, Cumbria, added: 'I am not scared 
of being in a police cell because I know I will get out the next day.

The model was cleared of missing two probation meetings at Manchester Magistrates' court, pictured. She walked from court after producing a letter from the Brussels clinic where she had her surgery

'I don’t worry about going to prison as the courts only give you a community service or a fine.'

She told the magazine she had no intention of changing her ways - saying she never provokes the fights, but instead 'stands her ground.'

However, she admitted she would like to calm down and have a family at some point.

The model has 11 previous convictions.

She drunkenly attacked two police officers in May 2012 - and was ordered to do 400 hours of litter-picking.

Within months, she was hauled back to court for missing two probation meetings to get a second breast enlargement in Belgium.

She faced the court this month for breaching the order by failing to give a 'reasonable excuse' for missing the January meetings.

But magistrates cleared Miss Dalzell when she produced a letter from a Brussels plastic surgeon.

With 180 hours of litter picking left to 
complete, Miss Dalzell has now declared she has ground to a halt because she
 'just can't physically do it'.

'At the moment I am refusing to go because I hate everything about it,' she told The Sun.

'They make you work from 8am until 4pm. It's a waste of a full day and it's just too hard for me.'

In the interview published today, she told Closer she received two black eyes and a broken nose in one of her last fights.

She said she usually just covers up her wounds with thick make up - but sometimes her fighting means she misses out on modelling jobs.

However, the model says she's got 'plenty of money saved up' so not working 'is not a problem'.

The model, who earns up to £4,000 a month, had her operation to increase her bra size from a 32C to a 32DD.

Speaking about the decision to go under the knife, rather than attend her meetings, she said the operation was important for her work so she 'didn't want to miss it.'

She added that she gave the court a medial note - and she was asked to pay a £95 fine instead.

Miss Dalzell, from Workington, Cumbria, said she usually covers up any of her fighting wounds with makeup. She added she doesn't mind if her fights means she missed a job as she's got 'plenty of money'
