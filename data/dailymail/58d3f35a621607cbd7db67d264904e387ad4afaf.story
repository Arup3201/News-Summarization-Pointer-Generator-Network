'We thought we were goners':  Gillian and Paul Mason, from Blackburn, were told they were 'seconds away from death' after an arsonist lit the fires

A British couple have revealed how flight attendants told them they were seconds from death after a mystery passenger tried to start three fires on their plane home from Australia.

Gillian and Paul Mason, from Blackburn, Lancashire, feared for their lives after the toilets were twice set ablaze on the Etihad Airways flight from Melbourne to Abu Dhabi.

Crew members battled to put out the fires at 35,000ft as the captain made an emergency diversion to Jakarta, Indonesia.

Passengers pleaded to get off the plane, but after a one-hour security check by Indonesian authorities the journey resumed - only for three more fires to be started.

Flight attendants told Mr Mason, 61, and his wife, 60, that the jet was just 90 seconds away from bursting into flames and plummeting into the Pacific Ocean.

Mrs Mason described the ordeal as 'the worst experience of her life' and said she was stunned they were allowed to carry on flying after the first spate of fires.

'It feels like an absolute miracle that the plane didn't go down and it was a massive relief to be able to get into the airport when we arrived in Abu Dhabi,' she said.

'We were actually told that the plane would have burst into flames if it had been spotted 90 seconds later.

'It was very quiet and all of a sudden I could smell burning and the staff flew down the aisle to see what was going on but it was obvious there was some sort of fire.

'It took a couple of fire extinguishers to put it out and we thought it was all under control.

'But not long after it happened again and there was quite a lot of panic on the plane by this point because we had no idea what was going on.

'The captain announced over the tannoy that there had been two serious security breaches and I noticed on the map that our plane had changed course.

'Shortly after that there was another announcement to say we were diverting to Jakarta and that security forces were going to check the plane over.'

The plane landed in the Indonesian capital to allow security teams to hunt down the culprit while the passengers were sent through metal detectors and had their hand luggage searched.

Officials then gave the go-ahead for the flight to get back on course to Abu Dhabi, but the culprit was still on board.

Mrs Mason added: 'We had no idea if anyone had actually been arrested and I felt it was a huge gamble to let us take off again given what had happened.

'When we eventually set off for Abu Dhabi, it happened again and I just thought we were goners - I couldn't let go of my husband's hand.'

'The worst experience of my life': Mrs Mason and her husband were returning home from a month-long stay with her sister in Tasmania, Australia, when they found themselves on a plane with the pyromaniac

The couple had been on the way home to Blackburn after enjoying a month-long holiday at the home of Mrs Mason's sister, Anne, in Tasmania, Australia.

'It's strange trying to come to terms with the fact we were only seconds away from crashing into the sea,' added Mrs Mason, a recently retired teacher.

'We're just both relieved that everyone on board was okay and that we're back at home.'

Etihad Airways said staff had launched an investigation into the fire once the plane landed in Indonesia, but allowed it to depart after the captain issued 'strict movement conditions'

A spokesman said: 'A comprehensive investigation into the incidents onboard EY 461 from Melbourne to Abu Dhabi on February 17 is still underway.

'The aircraft was searched and released shortly after arrival at Abu Dhabi when it was confirmed it was safe to do so.

'Etihad Airways is co-operating fully in this investigation.

'This follows a precautionary diversion to Jakarta where a security assessment of the situation was conducted with local authorities after smoke was detected in two of the toilets.

'The decision was made to resume the flight after a security search of the aircraft, passengers and their carry-on luggage.

'To further ensure the safety of passengers and crew, the captain implemented strict controls over passenger movement in the cabin, particularly passenger access to the toilets.

'The normal service was suspended to allow cabin crew to monitor and ensure the security of the cabin.'
