Around 470 miles away, another 19-year-old woman, Alyssa Byrne, went missing after a New Year's Eve South Lake Tahoe SnowGlobe Music Festival.

Friends who last saw Alyssa just before she unexpectedly left the three-day festival at the Horizon Casino Resort shortly after midnight claim she wasn't acting like her normal self.

Sheriff's Sergeant Pat Brooks, of Douglas County, Nevada, told the Mercury News that investigators found Alyssa's mobile phone was last used at three minutes past midnight that night.

Investigators are also reviewing surveillance footage from all casinos in the area and appealing for any information regarding Alyssa's whereabouts.

The last friend to see Alyssa, Micah Alex, from Petaluma, said he thought she may have been under the influence of alcohol or drugs when they briefly met in the lobby of the Horizon Casino Resort before she went missing.

He told the newspaper: 'She just seemed like something was wrong with her - like she wasn't all there, you know?

'We're all really scared.'

Alyssa is described as 5ft 3inches tall, weighing around 125 pounds,with fair skin, dyed black hair and blue eyes. She was last seen wearing a black sweatshirt, black snow boots, and black yoga-type pants with her hair pulled back.
