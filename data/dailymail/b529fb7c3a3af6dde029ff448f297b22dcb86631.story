Shafilea Ahmed, died at the age of 17

The sister of a schoolgirl allegedly murdered by her strict Muslim parents yesterday denied that her account of witnessing the killing was a ‘wicked’ lie made up to ‘save her skin’.

Alesha Ahmed told police she had seen their parents suffocating 17-year-old Shafilea with a plastic bag.

She claims her sister’s desire to live a westernised lifestyle had brought ‘shame’ on family in the eyes of their Pakistani-born parents, Iftikhar Ahmed, 52, and his 49-year-old wife Farzana.

But she did not accuse her parents of the killing until she was arrested for organising an armed robbery at the family home seven years after the alleged murder.

Yesterday Alesha denied making up her version of events out of desperation after police saw through her lie that she hadn’t set up the robbery. And while she admitted she had initially accused her family of framing her over the break-in, she insisted she was now telling the truth.

Cross-examining Alesha, her father’s barrister, Tom Bayliss QC, said: ‘You knew you could buy yourself out of trouble by making up a wicked story about your parents.’ She answered: ‘I don’t think the police are stupid enough to go on a story if they haven’t got any evidence.’

Mr Bayliss suggested her account was based on reading about the inquest into Shafilea’s death ‘and you used that knowledge to save your skin’. She denied this, adding: ‘It hasn’t saved my skin at all.’

Mr Bayliss also challenged her claim that she spoke out after being ‘haunted’ for years by the memory of Shafilea’s murder. He suggested she made her claims because ‘you’d just been caught red-handed committing a robbery at your parents’ house’. Alesha answered: ‘That’s not true.’

A group of men burst into the family home in Warrington, Cheshire in August 2010 while Mr Ahmed was out, tying up Alesha’s mother, brother and surviving sisters.

But Alesha wasn’t tied up. After the robbers escaped with cash and jewellery her family, who had heard them say her name, told police she had organised the raid.

She was arrested and a mobile phone Sim card containing text messages she had exchanged with the robbers was recovered from a toilet down which she had attempted to flush it.

Alesha, now 23, has pleaded guilty to involvement in the robbery but has not yet been sentenced.

Jurors at Chester Crown Court have been told by the prosecution that she received no ‘inducements’ over her punishment in exchange for testifying against her parents.

Speaking from behind a curtain shielding her from her parents in the dock, Alesha insisted she didn’t know the gang’s identities or how they got in.

But she admitted that after police discovered the Sim card, she claimed her phone had been taken off her by her mother and younger sister Mevish the previous evening.

Mr Bayliss said she had been trying to suggest any ‘incriminating text messages’ had been put there in order to frame her.

Alesha admitted she had been trying to get herself out of trouble.

‘And the way you were doing that was to tell lies about your family,’ said Mr Bayliss. ‘Yes,’ she answered.

He put it to her: ‘That’s you, Alesha Ahmed – you tell lies to get yourself out of trouble and you tell lies about your family.’ She answered: ‘On that occasion, yes.’ But she insisted she had been ‘open and honest’ in her evidence to the court.

Mr Bayliss said tapes show that officers interviewing Alesha after the robbery told her ‘we can only help you if you help us’.

They also told her ‘we are aware of how girls in Muslim families can be trapped, we know the price of not doing what you’re told’.

He suggested she then asked for the recording to be stopped so she could play her ‘trump card’.

‘You decided to tell the police it was your parents who killed your sister and you did it to get yourself out of trouble,’ the barrister added.

Denying his account, she sobbed as she answered that she had been ‘feeling really torn’ at the time.

‘I’ve got my sister who died on one side and my parents who I care about on the other,’ she added.

Alesha claims her parents pushed Shafilea onto the settee at the family home in September 2003 following a row over the clothes she had worn to work. Their mother said: ‘Just finish it here.’

They then stuffed a plastic bag into her mouth and held it there until she stopped breathing, Alesha alleged.

Five months later Shafilea’s decomposing body was found dumped beside a river in Cumbria.

Mr and Mrs Ahmed both deny murder. The trial continues.
