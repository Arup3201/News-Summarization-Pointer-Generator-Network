‘You are the best referees in the world and one of you will referee the ultimate football match – the World Cup final’.

Those were the first words I heard as I sat in the opening seminar in the build up to Korea/Japan 2002. The excitement and anticipation doubled from what were already very high levels after flying into Seoul with many of my European refereeing colleagues.

Most referees who are selected for the finals are aware that they travel more in hope than expectation of refereeing the final match but by being there they have a chance. Luck plays a huge part as some excellent referees miss out if their national team do well in the tournament or if one of their colleagues makes an error. For this reason there is a lot of fear within the refereeing camp and a sort of gallows humour once the games begin.

First there are a series of fitness assessments and training to undertake as well as listening and understanding the final instructions as to what FIFA expect from you at this, the highest level.

Of course when Howard Webb and his team of Mike Mullarkey and Darren Cann sit in their meeting in Rio they will be in a very different position – they have officiated that ‘ultimate’ match already.

Webb is the first referee in the modern game to return to the FIFA World Cup finals having done a final and knows that unless something extraordinary happens he will not referee the final this time around. The point is, given the way the appointment of the final referee has been done historically, it is unlikely that a UEFA referee will be appointed to the final.

For now though all thoughts of the final match are put aside as you try to get over jet lag and acclimatise to the very different surroundings and conditions. I found it incredibly intimidating not speaking a word of the language in either South Korea or Japan and not even being able to read or understand the different alpha characters on shop fronts.

Lost in translation: Italy's Pippo Inzaghi argues with Graham Poll and his team in 2002

As the English referees experience this in Brazil they will be looking around their colleagues and wondering who will join them as World Cup Final officials.

It could be that, given the relative inexperience of the group that a referee from Asia could be appointed for the final for the first time and Webb could get the opening match.

That would be an exact reversal of the appointments four years ago when the Uzbek, Ravshan Irmatov, refereed South Africa vs Mexico and opened that tournament in style.
