Most FA Community Shield games are soon forgotten. Some amuse briefly but only one truly lives on.

When Arsenal and Manchester City step out at Wembley to launch the new season on Sunday it will be 40 years since champions Leeds and FA Cup winners Liverpool contested the same fixture, then known as the Charity Shield.

It was the first time the match was contested at Wembley, the first time it had been televised live in full, the first time it would go to penalties and the first time in years that champions faced FA Cup winners.

It was also Bill Shankly’s last match as Liverpool manager before handing over to Bob Paisley and Brian Clough’s first serious game in his 44 days as Leeds boss.

The image of Clough leading out his players was used as the cover for David Peace’s book The Damned United.

Kevin Keegan and Billy Bremner were the first Brits to be dismissed at Wembley, tearing off their shirts as they trudged from the pitch.

The match finished 1-1, Phil Boersma putting Liverpool ahead and Trevor Cherry replying, but Liverpool won on penalties after Leeds keeper David Harvey missed his side’s sixth spot-kick.

‘It was probably a surprise to see such a competitive spirit,’ says Harvey, ‘but the players preferred that rather than for it to be like a testimonial.’

Liverpool’s Keegan was certainly provoked. Punched by Johnny Giles he grappled with Bremner early in the second half. Both were later banned for 11 games and fined £500 apiece.

‘I loved those games against Leeds,’ says Phil Thompson, the Liverpool defender, ‘but this was the beginning of the end for that team.’

Liverpool would win 10 league titles before Leeds won it again in 1992.
