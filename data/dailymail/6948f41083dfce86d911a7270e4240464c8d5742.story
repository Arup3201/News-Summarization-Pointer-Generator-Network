A radical British Islamist who stabbed a football fan in the head with a pen and skipped bail to join ISIS has uploaded a new photograph showing him posing with a notorious German jihadi in Syria.

Abu Rahin Aziz, 33, from Luton, fled the UK before he was handed a 36-week jail sentence in absence for attacking a football fan in London's West End.

Since joining ISIS he has spent much of his time of social media posting provocative message aimed at his largely Western audience - including threatening MPs at the coming general election and attempting to justify the brutal burning to death of murdered Jordanian pilot Moath al-Kasasbeh.

Now he uploaded a photograph showing him posing arm in arm with notorious German jihadi Denis Cuspert, who had been a relatively successful rapper under the name Deso Dogg before trading in his faux-gangster lifestyle to wage jihad on behalf of the Islamic State terrorist group.

Aziz, an ex office worker from Luton, previously told his followers on Twitter that he 'stabbed a kafir [non-believer] in the back of a head [sic] with a pen in London for insulting the Prophet Mohammed.'

Last year he was sentenced to 36 weeks for the offence - but by the time the case came to court, he had already skipped bail and travelled to Syria to fight for ISIS.

Aziz, 33, who tweets under the name 'Abu Adbullah Britani', is an associate of hate cleric Anjem Choudary who was once a member of radical group 'Muslims Against Crusaders'.

Although his Twitter pages have been repeatedly removed  thanks to the Anonymous cyber activist group's #OPISIS campaign targeting jihadi social media users, Aziz repeatedly sets up new accounts, which he users to taunt the West.

In January Aziz contemplated on Twitter which method he would use to destroy his British passport, confirming his intention not to return to the UK.

He wrote: 'Still deciding to what to do with my British passport, could burn it, flush it down the toilet.'

Also in January, Aziz used Twitter to incite violence from jihadis who are still living in the West.

'Muslims in the West given instructions to strike the enemies of Islam and Muslims within their own countries,' Aziz wrote. 'Wonder who will strike first?

'Could it be UK first to be attacked? They've attacked us with jets killing scores, plus they have many Muslims in prison as war on Islam.

'Maybe sit and wait outside TA offices? Maybe some other interests, maybe an MP. Hmm interesting. UK can blame foreign policy.'

In another message, Aziz wrote: 'A call upon Muslims in Europe to carry out attacks whether by explosive devices, bullets, car, rocks or even stones.'

A separate tweet  made a reference to British aid worker Alan Henning, who was beheaded by ISIS' executioner-in-chief, Mohammed Emwazi - also known as 'Jihadi John' - in October last year.

'All kufar [non-Muslims] even if they were good i.e. Alan Henning, Mother Theresa will burn in hell because they died upon disbelief,' Aziz wrote.

Aziz's latest tweets showed him posing with German rapper turned jihadi, Denis Cuspert.

The 39-year-old, who now calls himself Abu Talha al-Amani, embraced radical Islam and travelled to Syria to fight with militants before becoming the group's main propagandist.

In February it was revealed that the militant - who has starred in several grisly beheading videos for the Islamic State - was being spied on for the FBI by a Syrian woman he thought was his wife.

The jihadist also posted a photograph of himself and Dr Mirza Tariq Ali, 38, on Twitter which was captioned: 'This is us breaking our bail conditions being together in UK.' Ali, a former NHS surgeon, fled the UK in 2013

The spy transmitted critical information about the rapper and his ISIS colleagues before escaping to Turkey - where she was arrested and then turned over to the US, according to the German newspaper Bild.

The paper said German and American intelligence sources confirmed the existence of the operation, Fox News reports.

The unidentified woman fled Syria after her handlers told her it was no longer safe to continue the mission as militants had began to hunt and flush out infiltrators. She is now thought to be in the US.

German newspaper Bild believe Cuspert may have been targeted for the operation because of his womanising past.

In Germany he fathered three children by three different women, including one who he dumped just before embarking on his career as an ISIS poster boy. Cuspert arrived in Syria in 2013 from a so-called German jihadi colony in Egypt.

Last month the US added rapper Cuspert to its list of 'global terrorists' - freezing all his assets under US control and prohibiting any transactions with him in the future.

The State Department said: 'Cuspert is emblematic of the type of foreign recruit ISIL seeks for its ranks -– individuals who have engaged in criminal activity in their home countries who then travel to Iraq and Syria to commit far worse crimes against the people of those countries.'

Last November, Cuspert was compared to Nazi Minister for Propaganda Joseph Goebbels for his ability to appeal to young, disillusioned people in Europe while providing an alternative ideology.

He spent several years as a major player in the Berlin hip hop scene under the name 'Deso Dogg' before embracing radical Islam. 

He has been known to oversee the group's sophisticated media operation and is reportedly using British fighters in an attempt to attract even more of their countrymen to the war-torn region.

It is understood he leads a unit of German-speaking ISIS terrorists operating under the name 'The German Brigade of Millatu Ibrahim'.
