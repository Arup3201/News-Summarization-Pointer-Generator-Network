A British backpacker who moved to Thailand after seeing hit Leonardo DiCaprio film The Beach has been found dead on his tropical island paradise.

Jack Davies, 21, left Llanelli in west Wales to set up home on Phi Phi - a picturesque island chain off the coast of Phukhet where the Danny Boyle-directed blockbuster was filmed in 2000. 

His dream trip to South East Asia ended in tragedy however after he was found dead in the popular gap year destination, with Thai investigators still attempting to establish his cause of death.

Mr Davies flew 6,000 miles from his hometown in western Wales to the tropical islands off the coast of Thailand in order to spend three years partying and exploring with dozens of Western holidaymakers.

On the way he spent time in Australia, where a number of good friends came to know him as Jay. 

Describing the experience as 'the time of his life', Mr Davies kept in regular contact with his friends back home, having set off for Asia as soon as he had saved enough money after leaving school. 

His parents Christine and Jonathan Davies were told the heartbreaking news of his death at their home in Llanelli. His cause of death has not yet been established.

In a statement Mr Davies' parents said: 'He was a lovely boy and everybody loved him.'

Mr Davies had always dreamed of traveling, and so after finishing school in Llanelli he saved up as much money as he could in order to have what he described as 'the adventure of a lifetime'.

The only child admitted to having wanderlust - a word meaning the strong desire to travel, which he even had tattooed across his torso.

It was only after watching the Leonardo DiCaprio film adaptation of Alex Garland's famous novel 'The Beach' that he realised he was particularly drawn to the concept of a deserted tropical island paradise which he could explore by himself.

While many speak of the idea but never act upon it, Mr Davies travelled as quickly as he could to Phi Phi -  the island chain where the film, which also starred Robert Carlyle and Tilda Swinton, was shot.

He spent the next three years living and working on the island of Ko Phi Phi.

While in Thailand, Mr Davies kept himself incredibly fit and active - taking part in all manner of watersports and outdoor activities. 

Friends were quick to pay tribute to 'little legend' Mr Davies, who also had a tattoo on his chest with the words 'Life Ain't Chess' - a lyric by his favourite band The Strokes.

Writing on Facebook, Lucy Dixon wrote: 'Not only have you left footprints in paradise, you've left footprints across everyone's heart. Sleep tight buddy RIP xxx.'

A Foreign Office spokesman confirmed Mr Davies had died in Ko Phi Phi on 24 August 2014 and said they are providing 'consular assistance' to his family.
