They say that teenage years can be the best of a person's life. But for one 13-year-old, too much fun or excitement could be fatal.

Hannah Bowness-Major's organs start to shut down if she becomes too excited or stressed and her heart has already stopped four times.

She suffers from Addison's disease, which affects just 160 children in the UK, and her mother, Karen, is terrified she will eventually fail to recover from an attack.

Hannah Bowness-Major can't have too much fun as a rare condition means excitement could kill her

The teenager, from Cheshire, needs a cocktail of 30 drugs a day just so she can lead a normal life and she suffers from severe allergies that also put her at risk.

Hannah’s adrenal glands do not produce enough of the hormone cortisol and if the body’s levels of this chemical drop too far, it can be fatal.

Cortisol is vital to the functioning of the body because it helps to regulate blood pressure and allows the body to deal with stress.

If levels of the hormone in the body fall suddenly, symptoms such as vomiting, abdominal pain, low blood pressure and collapse can develop.

This can be fatal if it is not treated quickly.

Addison’s disease can also cause weakness, fatigue, loss of appetite and dizziness.

Hannah has to take a cocktail of 30 drugs a day to enable her to live a nearly normal life

Hannah said: ‘Living with my condition has sort of just become routine now because I have suffered with it for most of my life.

‘My friends know to tell me if they have something in their lunchbox that I could be allergic too.

‘But thankfully most of the things I'm allergic to my friends don't like anyway - so I have got that one in the bag.

‘I do miss out a bit when my friends go swimming because I can't go but I can still try and do most of the things they do.’

Addison's disease is a condition in which the body does not make enough of the hormone cortisol.

When the body's cortisol levels drop too low, this can cause a range of symptoms.

These include weakness, dizziness, fatigue and abdominal pain.

A very low cortisol level can be life-threatening.

This is because cortisol is vital as it helps regulate blood pressure and the immune system and it helps the body respond to stress.

Addison's disease is treated with hormone replacement tablets.

It is thought about 8,000 people in the UK have the illness and most cases first develop in people aged between 30 and 50.

About 70 per cent of cases are thought to be caused by an autoimmune disease but it can also be triggered by TB.

When Hannah gets excited, stressed or worried her body goes into an adrenal crisis which can cause her to faint or collapse.

The condition, which she was diagnosed with in 2006 after routine blood tests, means she needs to be very careful about her choice of activities.

Mrs Bowness-Major, 38, said: ‘When she gets too excited her body can't cope and shuts down.

‘She has collapsed on a trip to the Trafford Centre before now because of too much excitement.

‘It is physically and emotionally crippling to see Hannah looking at her younger sister on her bike or at swimming and you can see her wishing that she could do the same.’

Hannah’s condition means her body also struggles to fight infections because cortisol is important in controlling the immune system.

As a result, even a common cold could make her severely ill.

Mrs Bowness-Major, who works as a florist, said: ‘She can't go on public transport in case someone has a cold and sneezes on her.

‘She caught a stomach bug in 2010 and we really thought we were going to lose her.

‘Her body was shutting down and doctors had told us to prepare for the worst but, thankfully, she pulled through.’

Hannah can only tolerate three types of antibiotics and has food allergies so severe she has never even been able to go on a plane for fear that she could be exposed to an allergen in the plane’s atmosphere.

She is dangerously allergic to fish, pulses, citrus fruit, pulses, peas, green beans and some antibiotics, among other things.

Being exposed to even microscopic quantities of these items can cause her body to swell and makes it difficult for her to breathe.

Her mother said: ‘I want to be able to get my baby the best possible treatment.

Hannah's family are raising money to enable her to have a special pump fitted which will supply her body with the cortisol it desperately needs. They hope it will enable her to live a more normal life

‘It is a struggle for Hannah every day. It takes her about two hours in a morning just to get out of bed.

‘She struggles to walk great distances and it is hard because of her allergies to take her on holidays or out to restaurants.

‘You don't always know when she will get excited or stressed to monitor it because it is just something that happens.’

Her family are now raising funds so Hannah can be fitted with a hydrocortisone pump which would constantly supply the hormone she is missing.

Mrs Bowness-Major said: ‘I am desperate for her to be the person that I know she can be.

‘She still makes top sets in her classes despite missing 50 per cent of her classes and tries her hardest to do what other pupils can, even if it hurts her.

‘She is such a thoughtful kid, and despite some of the horrendous times she has been through she has never once cried.

‘If I could wave a magic wand and make it better or take it away from her and have it myself I would.’
