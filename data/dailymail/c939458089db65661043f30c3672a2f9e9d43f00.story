'Fabulous': Former colleagues defended DJ Dave Lee Travis, pictured arriving at court today

Dave Lee Travis gave colleagues 'bear hugs' and said 'grrrr' but it was never sexual, two former assistants have told his trial.

Caroline Bonfield, a PA who worked alongside the veteran DJ at Chiltern Radio - where he is alleged to have inappropriately touched three women - said he had a 'vice-like grip' and was 'very tactile'.

But she insisted he was a 'fabulous' man who no one considered a sex pest, adding: 'And we did talk about sleazy men'.

'He enjoyed the big bear hugs and cuddles,' Ms Bonfield told the jury today. 'There was no stroking or patting.

'It was just like "grrr" and you got a big old cuddle and he let you go.'

Sometimes he gave her 'shoulders a good old squeeze... [but] I never had a problem with that,' she said, even if it was not 'everyone's cup of tea'.

Ms Bonfield, who was the PA to Chiltern Radio's group managing director, said the allegations were 'totally ludicrous'.

'Anything like that would have gone round the station like wildfire,' she said. 'In any office it would, but particularly in the media.

'There was never any talk about it at all and we did talk about sleazy men.

'There was quite a robust HR department - there was no way it would have been allowed.'

Accused: Travis, 68, pictured arriving at court today, denies 13 indecent assaults and one sexual assault

Caroline Bonfield and Gemma Nurden both told the jury Travis (pictured) was tactile and gave people bear hugs - but he meant it in a friendly way, and anything more would have been spotted by staff at Chiltern Radio

Gemma Nurden, who worked as Travis's own personal assistant for 10 years, added: 'When Dave met people, he'd give them a big sort of bear hug.

'He just sort of would always put his arms around people but not in a seedy way or anything - just in a friendly way'.

Travis, who is on trial under his birth name David Griffin, denies 13 indecent assaults between 1976 and 2003 and one sexual assault in 2008.

The charges relate to allegations from when he was working as a BBC DJ, as a broadcaster with Classic Gold radio, while appearing on Top Of The Pops and when starring in panto.

The court heard Ms Nurden first worked for Travis in 1992 by feeding his chickens and pigs after his wife Marianne had an operation.

Trial: Former PA Gemma Nurden said Travis was not a 'big superstar' and would talk to anyone

The charges include periods when Travis, 68, was working as a BBC DJ, on Top Of The Pops and in panto

A year later she became his PA when he left the BBC to work in commercial radio.

She remained working with him until he left Chiltern Radio in 2002 - and told the court claims that he left because of sex pest allegations were 'ridiculous'.

Instead, she said, he left because there were plans to reduce his show from five days a week to just one.

Ms Nurden told Southwark Crown Court: 'He's great fun. He was a very sort of larger-than-life character. He would chat to anybody.

'He wasn't sort of like a big superstar that wouldn't talk to a doorman or anything like that, and just a lovely person.'

Reputation: The trial previously heard Travis was known as a sex pest - a claim rubbished in court today

Asked if she saw or heard anything to 
suggest Travis ever acted inappropriately with female staff at the radio
 station, Ms Nurden, who said she accompanied him to his show every day,
 told jurors: 'No.'

And when Stephen Vullo, defending, asked if colleagues knew Travis as a 'determined 
sexual predator' as the trial has already heard, she said: 'That’s completely untrue.'

Mr Vuillo asked if she could smell 'pungent aftershave' when Travis walked into the room, as other witnesses said. 'Yes,' she replied, as Travis gave a loud sigh in the dock.

Ms Bonfield said she was never aware any of her female colleagues felt Travis acted inappropriately and no allegations were made at the time.

'He was a breath of fresh air at the studio,' she said. 'He was funny, he was kind. Generous of nature. We loved having him about.'

Ms Bonfield was asked about an occasion when Travis was called into managing director Colin Wilshere’s office.

Prosecutors claim he was confronted about indecently assaulting one of the women, though Travis disputes this.

She told jurors she was aware of a 'kerfuffle' and was later told by Mr Wilshere: 'There’s been a bit of an upset with one of the girls.'

Ms Bonfield described the woman in question as 'quite strident, quite loud... Self-obsessed and a bit on the neurotic side.'

The court also heard from other women who worked at the radio station’s office in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, where Travis was based.

Vicki Turner told jurors she had 'not ever' witnessed him acting inappropriately and would have reported him if she had - as she had previously with other colleagues.

Despite most presenters having 'an ego which needs to be stroked', she described Travis as 'fun, very professional, very helpful, very kind', adding: 'He was happy to be there. He wanted to be liked.'

The trial continues.
