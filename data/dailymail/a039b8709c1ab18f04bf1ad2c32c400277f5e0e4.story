Dogs are stepping in to find birds that may be severely injured at a California solar power plant.

141 birds were found dead between July 2012 and December 2013 at Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System, according to an April report by the National Fish and Wildlife Forensics Laboratory obtained by KCET.

47 of those birds were killed by solar flux while 24 birds were killed by impact trauma.

Temperatures at Ivanpah's 'power tower' reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit, the report said.

As part of its multiple suggestions, the report encouraged using dogs to better report the number of birds that died or suffered injuries at the plant.

Burned: A Yellow-rumped Warbler, part of the National Fish and Wildlife Forensic Laboratory report, is seen with some of its flight feathers affected because of solar flux

Curled: A Peregrine falcon's wing, also part of the report, is damaged by solar flux

At Ivanpah, birds that suffered solar flux experienced 'feather curling, charring, melting and/or breakage and loss' and 'flight feathers of the tail and/or wings were invariably affected,' the report said.

The Office of Law Enforcement, part of the Fish and Wildlife Service, noticed 'streamers' at Ivanpah.

'Indeed OLE staff observed birds entering the solar flux  and igniting, consequently becoming a streamer,' the report said. 

The solar power plant was also deemed a 'mega-trap' for multiple species by the report's authors.

'[Ivanpah attracts] insects which in turn attract insect-eating birds, which are incapacitated by solar flux injury, thus attracting predators and creating an entire food chain vulnerable to injury and death,' the report said.

A report filed by energyservices with the California Energy Commission in May and obtained by KCET reported 80 dead birds at the power plant in May. Many of the birds were listed in the report as suffering burn injuries.

The suggestion to use dogs has so far proven successful, based off a report submitted to the California Energy Commission in June and obtained by Takepart.com.

That 
report, written by H.T. Harvey and Associates, said 91 birds died and 
five more were found injured at the solar power plant between October 
2013 and March 2014.

Humans recovered dead 35.7% of small bird species and 42.8% of dead large bird species in a trial, the report found.

However, researchers found that dogs, when paired with handlers, were able to find 68% of dead small bird species and 71% of dead large bird species.

In the wake of the findings, eight dog teams are currently being used at Ivanpah, PE.com reported.

'The dogs do love their work,' Brian Boroski of H.T. Harvey and Associates told the website. 'Their reward is play. So we keep it fun for them.'

'If you have [a dog] in your home, it would be the one who is bringing you a ball all of the time,' he added.
