Cuts of 20 per cent to the police budget by the Conservatives will leave the public unprotected against crime and terror, a retiring senior officer has warned.

Sir Hugh Orde, the retiring president of the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), claims the 'tipping point' between cutting resources and staff and increasing the risk to the public is close.

Since 2011 the Home Office reduced the amount spent on police by 20 per cent  and the Home Secretary Theresa May has said there will be further cuts if the Tories win the forthcoming election. 

Sir Hugh Orde, the retiring president of the Association of Chief Police Officers, warns that cuts to the police budget of 20 per cent, proposed by the Tories, will leave the public unprotected against crime and terror

One way some forces are reportedly going to try to operate on smaller budgets is by reducing the number of officers. 

Sir Hugh, who is due to stand down ahead of the creation of the National Police Chiefs' Council, told the Observer that taking police off the streets is a clear risk in the fight against extremism.

He said: 'The critical element, it seems to me, with dealing with people who will start to behave differently in their communities is the confidence in that community to speak to the local cops. 

'If the cops aren't there and that relationship has not been built we won't get the intelligence.'

Asked directly whether police would have adequate resources to protect the public in the context of cuts, he said: 'In my professional judgement, the answer is no.'

He added that cuts to other public services had put an increased pressure on the police, with officers having to fill in for ambulance crews and  those let down by depleted mental health care.

Sir Hugh, who left Acpo two weeks ago, said while it is accepted police cannot be exempt from cuts, he questioned how much more the forces can take.

He added that 44 police forces is too many and collaboration is important and cited the work of Sir Stephen House, chief constable in Scotland, who has brought together eight forces, where crime is at an all-time low.

Yvette Cooper MP, Labour's Shadow Home Secretary, said cuts would take spending back to 1930s levels and would sign the end of neighbourhood policing

Labour has claimed another 30,000 police officers could be lost if the Conservatives are returned to power in May.

Almost 7,000 police community support officers could also be cut by 2020, Labour said,  after commissioning figures from the House of Commons Library based on trends during the current Parliament.

Yvette Cooper MP, Labour's Shadow Home Secretary, said:  'Conservative plans to cut spending back to 1930s levels would mean the end of neighbourhood policing.

'These figure show that under these extreme and risky Tory plans a further 30,000 police officers could be lost - the equivalent of almost the entire Metropolitan police force.

'This is on top of the 17,000 cut since 2010 and would mean police numbers falling by a third after ten years of the Tories. And it would mean we would have fewer than 100,000 police officers.

'More serious and violent crimes including child abuse, rape and domestic violence are being reported, the terror threat has grown, and there has been a massive increase in online crime.'

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said his force had lost about 15 per cent of its grant, £600 million, in 12 months.

It had managed to maintain police numbers by making savings in the back office - they had lost 3,500 staff and buildings had been sold.

He told LBC: 'We have maintained the front line, so we are proud of that. Over the next few years, it is going to get very hard.'

He said he feared that after the next government gets in, the force will lose another 15 per cent, a total of a third, or £1.4 billion.

'When we have to find that amount, numbers will drop,' he said. 'We will have less police, we will have to manage it.

'We have still got to invest in counter terrorism, if people out there are trying to kill us, we'd better do something about it, and that means a lot of hard work.'

A Home Office spokesman said:  'Police reform is working and crime has fallen by more than a fifth under this Government, according to the Independent Crime Survey for England and Wales.

'While we acknowledge that the police funding settlement is challenging, there is no question that the police will still have the resources to do their important work. 

'What matters is how officers are deployed, not how many of them there are in total.

'The reduction in crime nationwide demonstrates there is no simple link between officer numbers and crime levels, the visibility of the police in the community and the quality of service provided.'

The spokesman added: 'Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary has found that the police are successfully meeting the challenge of balancing their books while protecting the frontline and delivering reductions in crime.'
