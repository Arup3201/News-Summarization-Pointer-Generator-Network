Famed for his controversial shark preserved in formaldehyde, rotting cow and his skin crawling Let's Eat Outdoors exhibition featuring thousands of flies snacking on an abandoned barbecue, Damien Hirst's name has become synonymous with modern art.

Over the years his works have netted him an estimated £350million fortune, with his most lucrative period coming between 2005 and the £111million sale of some of his work in 2008.

But it appears that the market value of some of his art may have plummeted, according to figures from art company Artnet, with works from those most profitable years reselling for almost 30 per cent less than their original purchase price.

A third of his 1,700 pieces that have gone under the hammer since 2009 have failed to sell at all, with a number of works not selling at London's Frieze art show this year and Sanctimony, a 2007 work featuring butterflies and household gloss failing to reach lowest pre-sale estimates by the end of an auction at New York's Sotherby's.

The fall in value has been attributed to an over-supply of his work - a huge collection of work was created around the turn of the millennium with 218 items marketed at a 2008 sale, and critics questioning the shelf life of the work of some of the Young British Artists, including Hirst.

Georgina Adam, editor at large of The Art newspaper, told The Independent: 'I think Hirst was a very good artist at the beginning but he has been a fabricator of luxury goods for a long time now.

'If you have a very early work that will remain valuable, but if you bought a print for £10,000 I don't think you are going to get your money back.'

Art market rumours suggest that his own dealers have stepped in to bid up the value of his work.

His most expensive work For the Love of God, a diamond encrusted skull, shifted for a hefty £50million.

Damien Hirst

Damien Hirst forged his reputation as the enfant terrible of the British art world.

His iconic pieces have garnered plaudits and abuse in equal measure - but they have also made him one of the richest artists alive. The Turner Prize winner is now worth an estimated £215million.

Hirst's most controversial pieces have included a shark entombed in formaldehyde which was funded by Charles Saatchi and eventually sold for £50,000.

This was followed by Away from the Flock, a sheep, once again pickled in formaldehyde, which was vandalised by another artist while on display at the Serpentine Gallery.

Mark Bridger poured black ink into the tank and then announced he was renaming the work Black Sheep. He was given two years' probation for his actions.

There was yet more controversy when Hirst attempted to exhibit Two F*****g and Two Watching in New York.

This was the work that featured a rotting cow and bull - and was banned by public health officials over fears of 'vomiting visitors.'

For the Love of God was the artist's most recent high profile work. A human skull encrusted with 8,601 diamonds, it cost £14million to produce and sold in 2007 for £50million. 

In the last few years, Hirst has begun to concentrate on painting.
