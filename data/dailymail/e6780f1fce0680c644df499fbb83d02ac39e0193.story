The U.S. Bureau of Land Management has withdrawn a permit allowing a pro-hunting group to hold a wolf and coyote shooting derby on public land in Idaho.

The agency canceled the permit last night, after it was issued Nov. 13 to Idaho for Wildlife that provided use of about 3 million acres of federal land for the three-day event in early January.

The agency says the group modified the derby's rules, making it unclear if the permit still applied.

The derby would have seen an unlimited number of wolves and other animals killed by hunters

Derby organizers say the agency caved in to environmental groups but that the event will still be held on U.S. Forest Service land and private ranches in the east-central part of the state near Salmon.

The BLM faced two federal lawsuits from conservation groups contending the agency violated environmental laws in issuing the permit.

Groups claimed the hunt on public lands was 'not in the public interest'.'

'BLM's first-ever approval of a wolf-killing derby on public lands undermines wolf recovery in the Northern Rockies and was not in the public interest', director of litigation at Advocates for the West, Laird Lucas, said.

Hundreds of hunters could have been involved in the derby which would kill wolves, skunks, weasels, starlings, raccoon, coyotes and jackrabbits, The Guardian reported. 

A press release showed more than 100,000 comments from Environmental groups criticizing  the derby.
