Eight areas to receive a fuel duty cut are Lib Dem constituencies but Treasury Secretary Danny Alexander dismissed any claims of favouritism

Drivers living in remote or rural areas are to receive a 5p a litre discount on their petrol.

Three communities in England and seven in Scotland have been judged to meet strict criteria to qualify, the Government will announce today.

They will receive the fuel discount already introduced in the remote Inner and Outer Hebrides, Northern Isles, and Scilly Isles.

The move has still to be approved by the European Commission but Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander told the Daily Mail there was an overwhelming case for a cut in duty in far-flung areas of the country that have high prices at the pumps.

Critics pointed out, however, that eight of the ten areas to benefit are in constituencies with Liberal Democrat MPs – two of them in Mr Alexander’s own seat.

Four are in the constituency of former Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy and one in Tory Foreign Secretary William Hague’s seat.

Labour suggested it showed the Chief Secretary was willing to cut the cost of living only in ‘his own back yard’.

But Mr Alexander dismissed any claims of favouritism, insisting the areas qualify because they are similar to the islands eligible for the existing discount.

‘It’s something that for people in these communities will make a real difference,’ Mr Alexander said.

‘The Daily Mail has rightly highlighted the fact that fuel costs matter to everybody, but particularly to those in rural communities where a car is a necessity not a luxury.’

The fuel discount can be introduced only if the Government can persuade the European Commission that it would not breach EU competition laws. A decision is expected within six months.

Precedents have been set by Corsica and the Portuguese and Greek islands, which already enjoy fuel tax discounts approved by Brussels. If the extension is approved, it will bring the number of people in the UK to benefit from the rural fuel scheme to nearly 120,000.

The new areas to qualify include towns in North Yorkshire, Cumbria and Devon.

They are at least 100 miles from a refinery and have sparse populations and high petrol prices.

Catherine McKinnell, Labour spokesman on the economy, said: ‘Eight out of ten of these areas have Liberal Democrat MPs – including two in Danny Alexander’s own constituency.

‘The public will want to be reassured this is no more than a coincidence because nobody will thank a Lib Dem Treasury Minister who refuses to tackle the cost of living crisis everywhere but his own back yard.’

But Mr Alexander said: ‘This has been a completely objective process. The list has been drawn up with pretty strict criteria.’

He also backed George Osborne’s attempt to hold prices down for motorists across the country by keeping fuel duty frozen until the 2015 election. It means that by then petrol will be 20p a litre cheaper than it would have been under the previous Labour government’s plans.

Average petrol prices in the UK fell 5.49p a litre to 132.16p between mid-September and mid-October, said the AA. But it warned that a further dip in prices soon is unlikely.

Motorists are enjoying the biggest fall in petrol prices since the depths of the credit crunch in 2008 – cutting nearly £4 off the cost of filling a family car.
