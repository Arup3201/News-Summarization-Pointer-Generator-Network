Mayor Michael Bloomberg, the campaign crusader against sugary sodas and fatty fast food, can't be happy now that Burger King is delivering in New York City.

Starting in January, the fast food chain is expanding its delivery program into New York City, and expects as many as 10 participating restaurants by end of year that will serve the Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan boroughs.

'We are thrilled to expand the BK 
Delivers test program and offer its convenience to our New York guests 
in the city that never sleeps,' said Alex Macedo, senior vice president 
and general manager of U.S. franchise business for Burger King 
Worldwide.

'Our goal has always been to provide excellent service and great tasting food to our guests. After seeing the success this program has experienced...we are excited to bring this convenience to New York.'

The service is already available in the Miami and Washington, D.C., areas, as well as Turkey, Mexico, Peru, Colombia and Brazil.

People can order by calling a toll-free number or ordering online. Pricing may vary by location, and the delivery operating hours of 11am until 10pm with a minimum order of $10.

Mr Bloomberg has a long history of various bans including smoking, sodas and fatty fast foods in moves meant to combat obesity and encourage New Yorkers to live healthier lifestyles.

In 2006, the New York City Board of 
Health approved Mr Bloomberg's plan to ban trans fat in cooking oils 
within the city's 24,000 food establishments.

In 2007, Bloomberg introduced an initiative for chain restaurants to display calorie information on menus and menu boards.

Mr Bloomberg unveiled a plan 2010 to 
cut the amount of salt in packaged and restaurant food by 25 percent 
over a five-year period.

That same year, he successfully lobbied New 
York City's Board of Health to ban the sale of sugary drinks in 
containers larger than 16 ounces in restaurants and other venues.

Mr Bloomberg proposed a smoking ban in public spaces. Now, it's illegal and carries a $50 fine.
