A family grieving over the sudden death aboard a cross-country flight of a 16-year-old disabled boy is outraged over an attempt to cash in on their tragedy.

Zachary Bisiar, who suffered from Cerebral Palsy, died last weekend after a heart attack caused him to go into cardiac arrest 30 minutes into a flight from Seattle to Atlanta.

Family members watching a news report about the boy’s death noticed a ‘donate’ button embedded in the report, but they have no idea who is taking the money donated.

‘We saw a YouTube video showing a CNN report and it had a donation button at the bottom that looked like someone was using the tragedy to get money,’ uncle Steven Leahy told ABC News.

The thought that someone would try to get some financial gain off this really upset me,’ he added.

Mr Bisiar was flying to Atlanta with his mother, grandmother and a sibling because his step-father, an Iraq veteran, was relocated from Fort Lewis, in Washington, to Fort Hood, in Georgia.

The devastated family is struggling to keep up with the costs of both the move and the funeral, so Mr Leahy set up a his own separate fundraising page where people can donate money and be sure it will reach the family.

‘I used to be in the military and I know what limited pay you get,’ said Mr Leahy. ‘There is the cost for the move.’

My brother-in-law was driving the car and bringing all their household necessities, and there was gas and lodging across country, then the tragedy hit,’ he continued.

The medical examiner's office in Washington's Spokane County believe Zachary's death was due to 'a rare complication of a rare disease process. The manner of death is natural'

‘Please help my sister and her husband who lost their son, Zachary Bisiar, on flight 128 from Seattle to Atlanta,’ he writes on the GoFundMe page he has launched.

‘All proceeds will go towards laying him to rest and aiding the family with the difficult time they are having now with the loss of their child.’

The incident happened aboard Delta Flight 128, which departed Seattle around 9 a.m. local time on Saturday.

The medical examiner's office in 
Washington's Spokane County said on Monday that the autopsy results for 
Zachary were still pending further tests.

Forensic
pathologist Sally S. Aiken, with Spokane's Medical Examiner office, 
noted that the cause of the boy's death is currently 'pending' further 
microscopic and other studies.

In
a statement, Dr. Aiken said that it was 'thought to be a rare 
complication of a rare disease process. The manner of death is natural.'

The plane was diverted to an airport in Spokane, Washington, after the boy suffered a medical emergency and died on board.

'It was a complete surprise - they were completely devastated,' said Spokane Fire Department spokesperson Brian Schaeffer.

The family had decided to fly to Georgia rather than drive after learning of a similarly afflicted child developing complications from blood clots during a cross-country drive, Mr Leahy told ABC.

The teen was cleared by doctors to fly.

Washington State patient-confidentiality rules prohibit local officials from divulging such information outside of a coroner’s report, but Schaeffer did say there was nothing in his medical history to suggest such an incident was to be expected.

The boy and his family were sitting at the back of the plane when they began calling for help, passenger Joe Ryan, of Atlanta, told MailOnline.

Zachary's uncle Steven Leahy has launched a fundraising page to help his sister and her husband cover the expenses involved in funeral which is scheduled for December 22

The flight crew immediately sprung into action. Despite the dire circumstances, everyone – including passengers – remained calm and collected throughout.

‘It was calm and the male flight attendants rushed to his aid at the back of the plane,’ said Ryan.

‘They started performing CPR on him… the pilot got on the air and said we are going to have an emergency landing.’

‘We were on the ground in five minutes... I think that they did everything they could to save that boy’s life,' Ryan added.

A registered nurse aboard a flight, Dan Goslin, told WSBTV that he and two other passengers, a doctor and a midwife, did everything they could to revive the boy.

'He was having trouble breathing. We tried oxygen. That didn't work. We tried to move him out of the chair and get him to another position. That didn't work and everything we tried just really didn't work,' Goslin said.

Emergency personnel were already on their way when the plane touched down.

‘We met them on the ground with our fire fighter paramedics and attempted resuscitate him for well over 30 minutes,’ Schaeffer said.

‘Paramedics rushed on to the plane, you could tell there was a lot of urgency… then everything calmed down and you could put two and two together,’ Ryan lamented.

The boy was pronounced dead on the plane.
