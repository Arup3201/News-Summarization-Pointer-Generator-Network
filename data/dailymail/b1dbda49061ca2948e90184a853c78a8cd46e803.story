When it comes to dinner time, meals in Wendy Jordan's house are a very chaotic affair with sixteen hungry mouths to feed.

Every evening, the mother-of-two has a small army of dogs queuing up in her kitchen waiting for their food.

The kind-hearted 67-year-old shares her small three-bedroom property with 16 pets she saved from animal rescue centres.

All of the animals faced being put down until the former college manager stepped in to save them.

Full time job: Wendy, who is retired, spends her days walking, grooming and feeding her pets

Wendy's home is now so crowded she can’t even find a seat in her own front room to watch TV as they have all been taken over by her pack of pampered pets.

'My problem is that I just can’t say no. I’m friendly with the local dog warden and every time I hear about a homeless hound I have to take it in,' she said.

'My house is a flurry of dog beds, balls, leads and poo bags.

'But they are very loving, they are my life. I particularly love older dogs. I hate it when people abandon them.'

Feeding her 16 best friends costs so much that Wendy had to sell her last house and move somewhere cheaper.

And when she goes on holiday every year Wendy takes the dogs with her.

Wendy said: 'The dogs get really excited as they can sense when we are going on holiday.

'We all go to a farm in West Wales - it’s so lovely seeing them run happily down on the beach.'

Wendy, of Splott, Cardiff, has now registered as a an official charity called Kim’s Home, named after the first dog she rescued.

She said: 'I love having my home full of dogs - they are such loving, beautiful creatures.'

Overrun: The dogs get some sleep wherever they can lay down in the three-bedroom home in Cardiff
