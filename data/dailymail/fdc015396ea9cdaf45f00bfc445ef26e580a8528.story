A 9-year-old survivor of last year's tragic shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut has found comfort in a place many people wouldn't expect: a stocky, 73-pound pit bull named Jeffrey.

While many would see Jeffrey and run for the hills, Sandy Hook fourth-grader Emma Wishneski considers him one of her closest friends - she even plans to bring a miniature, stuffed version of the dog with her on her upcoming first day of school.

Despite his hulking size - and unwarranted bad reputation - Jeffrey is a registered therapy dog whose job it is to put a smile on the face of a human who may be having a tough time, or suffering from a serious injury or disease.

And Jeffrey is very good at his job.

'It all starts with a belly rub,' Jeffrey's owner, Michele Houston, told NBC's Today. 'He meets you, he flops on his back. Then his magic starts.'

Jeffrey's healing powers almost were never realized - two years ago, he was one of hundreds of pit bulls in the New York City shelter system that was likely to be euthanized. Then a pit bull rescue group called Bruised Not Broken took an interest and attempted to find him a home by placing him on its advocacy website.

Ms. Houston, a hospice worker in Milford, Connecticut, found Jeffrey on the website and offered to adopt him just hours before he was scheduled to be euthanized. 

Ms. Houston was never worried about Jeffrey being a pit bull - a breed of dog that has a stereotype of being aggressive and dangerous, a stigma Ms. Houston hopes to change.

'Both ends of the leash are responsible for the future of these dogs,' 
said Houston, who also brings Jeffrey to assisted living facilities, 
hospitals and school libraries to connect with elderly people, the sick,
and struggling young readers.

Popular pooch: Jeffrey has more than 700 Facebook followers and a full schedule of therapy sessions

At 73 pounds, Jeffrey will curl into a ball and roll onto his back on command. He'll then paw the air with his signature painted toe nails, inviting people in for a belly rub.

After adopting Jeffrey, Ms. Houston enrolled him in obedience training and ultimately took him to the American Kennal Club to have him tested to become certified for therapy.

'He 
passed with flying colors,' she recalled. 'The examiner, he said if you 
don't make this dog a therapy dog it would be a shame.'

Now, 
Jeffrey is known as the 'Positively Peaceful Pit Bull,' and has more 
than 700 Facebook fans, as well as a full schedule of therapy visits in the 
tri-state area.

But Emma remains one of his favorite clients.

'"Emma" is a special word in our house,” Houston said.

Emma and Jeffrey first met in December - just weeks after the senseless shooting spree that left 28 people dead, including 20 first-grade students - at a Christmas party for her classmates.

Emma was thankfully tardy the day of the shooting and missed horrific event thanks to a doctor appointment that morning. But she lost several friends and teachers.

'It was still a really vulnerable time for her, and she 
just was comfortable sitting next to Jeffrey,' Emma's mother, 
Marykay Wishneski, told Today. 'He's strong and I think she just feels safe.'

The day after their initial meeting, Emma asked her mother if she could see the friendly pooch again, so Ms. Wishneski got in touch with Ms. Houston to arrange another play date for the two - the first of many.

'I think for her, there's a security in 
that it's a dog and not another person,' Ms. Wishneski said. 'Emma becomes 
free and runs and plays and smiles. It's a very tender thing between the
two of them.'

Jeffrey even attended Emma's 9th birthday party in April. He was wearing a hat in the shape of a birthday cake and let Emma and her friends climb all over him.

After getting to know her new friend, Emma wants to be a veterinarian, and has helped her family train a Wheaton-Doodle they adopted.

'I think that she loves that Jeffrey is a therapy dog — that he has a 
job and that there's something special about him,' Ms. Wishneski said.

Emma starts fourth grade on Tuesday, and while the wounds of the Sandy Hook shooting are still there, Jeffery has helped them heal for Emma.

'Emma has a smile that could light the world, and I feel like we used to see that smile a lot more, but it's definitely still there,' Ms. Wishneski said. 'And when she's with Jeffrey she doesn't stop smiling.'
