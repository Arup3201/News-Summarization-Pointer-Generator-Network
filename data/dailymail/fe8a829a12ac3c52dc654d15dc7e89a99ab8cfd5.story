Singer FKA twigs has proven just what a lucky man her boyfriend Robert Pattinson is, posing topless in a tasteful, yet risque, cover shoot for fashion favorite V Magazine.

The British-born musician, real name Tahliah Barnett, showcases her enviable figure in the striking images, while wearing nothing other than a pair of nude panties and a selection of chunky silver necklaces.

And while the 26-year-old does not discuss her relationship with Pattinson, 28, who she has been dating for four months, in the accompanying interview with The New Yorker's Sasha-Frere Jones, she does touch on the way in which she feels she has grown as a woman in recent months. 

Bold and beautiful: Singer FKA twigs appears on the cover of V Magazine's New Music Issue this month

'I feel more like a woman': The 26-year-old revealed in the interview that she has felt more able to embrace her own femininity after seeing men who are comfortable with their own

Speaking about her background as a ballet dancer, FKA explains that she feels she has only really been able to grow as a woman after seeing male dancers embrace their own femininity. 

'I wrote a song, a month ago,' she says. 

'I can't remember the lyrics. It was something like "boys growing boys growing girls into women". 

'I've felt more like a woman since I've met these men so in touch with their femininity. They teach me how to be a woman, how to feel, how to have class and poise, and how to feel good about myself. 

'I'll dance for them and I'll dance for myself, as thanks.'

But while she doesn't mention 28-year-old Pattinson in the piece, it is clear that the couple's relationship is growing more serious. 

So in love: FKA has been dating Twilight star Robert Pattinson for four months

According to a recent report in the Mail on Sunday, the pair spent Christmas at the home of Pattinson's parents in Barnes, West London, with a source close to the actor claiming Mr and Mrs Pattinson made it very clear that they prefer FKA to their son's ex-girlfriend and former Twilight co-star Kristen Stewart.

'FKA is not as clean-cut,' said a family friend. 'But that makes her more fun, and Robert can get very serious.' 

While her relationship with her actor beau has seen her launched into the public spotlight in recent months, the former ballerina has been careful to distance herself from Pattinson in a professional sense - and has done everything she can to make a name for herself within the music industry in her own right.

Indeed, when it comes to her own unique style of music and performance, FKA is very clear about the way in which she wants her music to be seen and even hit out at the people who insist on labeling her music 'alternative' during her V Magazine interview. 

'If I say "alternative red" to you, it's not red, is it?' she explains. '"Alternative R&B is patronizing to R&B. 

Baring all: American musician Tinashe also posed topless for her own V Magazine cover 

In good company: FKA's fellow Brits Sam Smith (L) and Jessie Ware (R) were also chosen to appear on the cover of this month's New Music Issue

'R&B is R&B - it doesn't need an alternative. There are plenty of artists now experimenting with electronic music, manipulating sounds.'

Despite her confident cover shoot the musician, whose critically-acclaimed debut album LP1 reached number one in both the US and UK, revealed to Vogue last month that she doesn't enjoy having her photo taken. 

'Sometimes I really struggle having my picture taken,' she told the publication, after being named their next Style Breakout Star.

Luckily, her shoot in V Magazine's New Music Issue saw her joined by three other successful chart-toppers: Sam Smith, Tinashe, and Jessie Ware, all of whom shot their own covers for the publication, with American musician Tinashe also opting to pose topless.
