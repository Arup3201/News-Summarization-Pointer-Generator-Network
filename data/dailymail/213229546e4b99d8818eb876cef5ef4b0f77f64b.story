Hull KR have signed Parramatta winger Ken Sio on a three-year contract from next season.

The 23-year-old Sio, who has scored 35 tries in 55 appearances for the Eels since making his debut in the last match of the 2011 NRL season, is the Robins' second capture for 2015 following the signing of Wigan centre Darrell Goulding.

Hull KR caretaker coach Chris Chester said: 'We've been looking to add some strike to the side and he is a proven try scorer who we are confident will suit both the club and the Super League competition.

Forward thinking: Ken Sio scored 35 tries in 55 games for the Eels before heading to Hull KR

'We're lacking a bit of speed on the edges at the moment and Ken will bring that. We're looking forward to having him on board.'

Sydney-born Sio, who can also play centre and full-back, has scored 11 tries in 10 matches for Parramatta so far this season.

'It's always been a dream of mine to play in Super League," he said. 'I didn't think it would happen until later in my career but the opportunity has come up early and I'm excited to have a crack at it.

'It's going to be a different style of footy but I think it will be a more open competition and hopefully I can bring my ability to score tries over to Hull KR and add something to the team.

'Coming over there is a massive move for me and it will be great to experience living and playing overseas so I'm really excited about it and I can't wait to get started.'
