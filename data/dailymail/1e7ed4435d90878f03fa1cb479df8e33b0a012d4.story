Maxine Carr, now 34, enjoyed a relaxing honeymoon at a family-friendly resort days after marrying her 'besotted' boyfriend

Maxine Carr enjoyed a relaxing honeymoon at a bustling ‘family-friendly’ resort just days after marrying her ‘besotted’ boyfriend, it has emerged.

Carr, 37, who now lives under a new identity thanks to a lifelong anonymity order, is said to have spent time talking and joking with other parents and children during her holiday.

It comes following a private wedding ceremony attended by both families of the pair during which guests toasted the marriage with a three-course banquet and sparkling wine.

The former girlfriend of Soham murderer Ian Huntley married her current boyfriend in front of a registrar before celebrating the wedding with friends and family at a hotel.

Carr, who served 21 months in jail for providing killer Ian Huntley with a false alibi after he murdered Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman, both ten, in 2002, wore a £2,000 ivory dress for her big day.

The former teaching assistant was given away at the ceremony by her 71-year-old mother.

Her new husband is said to be ‘absolutely besotted’ with her despite knowing about her shameful past and the pair relished in posing for photographs on the hotel’s patio at their wedding reception.

Following the ceremony, the newlyweds departed for their honeymoon at a family-friendly resort, although it is not known whether they travelled abroad or remained in the UK for the romantic break.

Due to her lifelong anonymity order, Carr assumes a completely new identity and is said to have changed her appearance so she is not easily recognisable.

However, one source said families would be ‘horrified’ to know it was her they were joking around with during her honeymoon.

A source told The Sun: ‘They’d be horrified to know they could have been within yards of one of the most hated women in Britain.’

Carr was the girlfriend of school caretaker Huntley when he was arrested soon after the bodies of schoolgirls Holly and Jessica were found in August 2002. They had been missing from their homes in Soham, Cambridgeshire, for 13 days.

Huntley eventually admitted that the girls had died in his house after he had invited them in, but said their deaths were accidental.

He had told them that Carr was in the house, but she had actually gone to Grimsby to visit relatives.

Although Carr was not implicated in the murder, she gave Huntley a false alibi, claiming that she had been with him at the time of the killings, which delayed the police investigation.

In fact she was at a nightclub in Grimsby with another man.

She was originally jailed for three-and-a-half years for perverting the course of justice by covering for Huntley but only served half of her sentence. She was given anonymity for life on her release in 2004.

It means details of her honeymoon, wedding or new partner cannot be published because it could lead to her identification.

She is just one of four former UK prisoners to be given secret identities, along with child killer Mary Bell and James Bulger’s murderers Robert Thompson and Jon Venables.

Police protection and a new identity for Carr are thought to have cost the taxpayer millions.

Huntley, now 40, was found guilty of murdering the girls following a seven-week trial at the Old Bailey, and is now serving a double life sentence in prison.
