They've battled it out over meat pies here in Australia, so it seems only natural that Karl Stefanovic and Ben Fordham would go head to head over hot dogs in New York.

The Today show co-host and sports presenter wrapped up their week-long broadcast from Times Square on Friday by challenging each other to a hot dog eating challenge.

The pair were wide-eyed when two humongous trays of New York-style hot dogs were wheeled out in the studios as fellow co-hosts Lisa Wilkinson and Sylvia Jeffreys watched on in encouragement.

Karl, who had been in training all week according to co-host Lisa Wilkinson, eventually came out on top by half a hot dog

'You've been in serious training all week and it's been seriously impressive,' Wilkinson quipped as Stefanovic drizzled tomato sauce over his share of hot dogs.

Stefanovic and Fordham were given one minute on the clock to eat as many as possible.

The duo stared each other down as they chowed down on the first hot dog, before sports presenter Fordham started to gag when he literally tried to bite off more than he could chew.

When the buzzer timed, Stefanovic was up by half a hot dog.

Fordham ended up congratulating Stefanovic on his victory with a hot dog infused kiss right on his cheek.

It follows the duo's pie challenge in 2013, which left Stefanovic red-faced and 'seriously crook' after eating the hottest chilli pie in the world.
