Cristiano Ronaldo returned to training with Real Madrid after missing Portugal's defeat to Albania through injury.

The 29-year-old looked in rude health as he prepared for Real's league match against local rivals and defending champions Atletico Madrid.

But Sami Khedira's troubles appear to have deepened after the German midfielder underwent arthroscopic surgery on his knee.

Khedira was already sidelined as he was recovering from a left hamstring injury sustained last month.

The European champions did not say how long they expect Khedira to be out for. The 27-year-old tore a right knee ligament last November and didn't play until May, returning just in time to feature in the World Cup.

A proposed summer move to Arsenal had looked likely for the former Stuttgart man but his wage demands ultimately killed the deal.
