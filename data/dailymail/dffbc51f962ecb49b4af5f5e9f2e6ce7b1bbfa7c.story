They're highly-trained search and rescue pilots who risk life and limb to rescue people trapped in dangerous and life-threatening situations.

So it was perhaps a bit of a surprise for RAF Chivenor’s 22 Squadron when they were called to free a man trapped bottom up in a bramble bush.

Marcus Wilde got himself into the prickly situation when a model aircraft he was flying, near 
the Morte Point beauty spot at Woolacombe, Devon, 
crash-landed.

The 42-year-old waded into the thick, thorny 
undergrowth to retrieve the plane, but he got so tangled in the brambles 
that he couldn’t get out again.

The local coastguard and a search and 
rescue helicopter from RAF Chivenor’s 22 Squadron were scrambled to the 
scene.

The chopper hovered over the bushes and crews managed to cut down the brambles and winch him to safety.

However, some members of the public have criticised the rescue saying it was a waste of public money to send out a helicopter for someone stuck in a bush.

A coastguard spokesman said: 'He 
wasn’t badly injured but he’d been stuck fast in the brambles and it 
seemed the simplest way to get him out. It was certainly one of our more
unusual rescues.'

Construction worker Mr Wilde, of 
Braunton, Devon, said he was stuck in the bush for an hour, unable to crawl out.

Marcus Wilde struggled for an hour after falling 15ft into chest deep in brambles. He said he was covered in cuts and it was a distressing, horrible experience

He said: 'A group of six of us were 
flying model aircraft on Morte Point and unfortunately mine lost signal 
with the remote control and got stuck in a bush.

'The plane is worth £200 and contains a battery which can catch fire so I decided to try and retrieve it.'

He started his hunt in a patch of soft bracken while being guided by a friend looking down from a slope above him.

However, Mr Wilde could not see a 15ft drop in front of him and tumbled down the bank into the two-metre deep bramble patch.

He said: 'I was completely stuck 
upside down and covered in cuts. My clothes were ripped to pieces. The 
more I struggled, the worse it got.

'I felt helpless, distressed, disorientated and dehydrated. It was a horrible experience.'

Mr Wilde has hit back at critics who said it was a waste of public money to mount such a large rescue operation for someone who'd toppled into a thorn bush. He said the experience was 'extremely frightening'

He added: 'They couldn’t see me at 
first because I was so deeply buried. When they did find me they 
attached a harness, told me to curl up into a ball and literally ripped 
me out of the brambles.

'What made the whole thing even more 
embarrassing was that I knew almost all of the rescue crew as I fly 
model airplanes at Chivenor most weeks.'

Mr Wilde has been in for stick through online 
forums from people who claimed it had been 'stupid and a waste of public
money' to mount such a large rescue operation for someone who’d toppled
into a thorn bush.

But Mr Wilde has hit back, saying: 'The experience was extremely frightening and I found people’s comments afterwards very offensive.

'This is exactly what the emergency 
services are here to do - deal with emergencies. Unless you were there 
you really can’t appreciate it,' he said.

'The helicopter crew were so 
concerned about the potentially flammable battery that they went back to
recover it after they had rescued me. This was not a trivial situation and I have found some of the comments against me very offensive.'
