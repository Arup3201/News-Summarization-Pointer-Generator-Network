However, he was too far down the drain and one man actually had to climb into the hole to locate him.

An SPCA animal rescue worker on the scene said she was impressed with the dedication of the animal-lovers.

'This is amazing. If every neighborhood cared this much . . . Houston would not have the problem of over [dog] population that we have.'

A resident reportedly heard a cry Wednesday night, and discovered the pup was trapped. 

After he was saved from peril, Merrill headed to the vets for a check-up.

He is expected to be fine with no visible injuries. It is not clear if he had an owner.
