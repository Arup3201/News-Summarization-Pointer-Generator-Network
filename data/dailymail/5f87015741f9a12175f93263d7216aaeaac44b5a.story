Witnesses to a horrific crash claim a baby was catapulted to safety from its mother's womb when she was hit by a truck and killed.

Heavily-pregnant Wang Zhau, 40, was travelling to hospital with her husband Mao, 42, when they were hit by a truck and both flung from the vehicle.

Eye-witnesses claim the wheels of the truck then went over the woman and the baby was forced from her womb by the impact and catapulted to safety three metres away.

Others reported that the woman gave birth immediately after being hit by the truck and then died. Her husband was also killed in the crash but the baby was taken to hospital in Xiamen, Fujian Province, China, and is expected to survive.
