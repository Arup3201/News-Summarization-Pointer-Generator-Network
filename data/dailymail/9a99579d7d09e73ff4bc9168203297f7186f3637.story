Seven teenagers wandered into the home of former Miami Heat star Ray Allen early on Thursday simply because they wanted to see where he lived, police have said.

The friends, aged 18 and 19, were at a party next door to the basketball player's home in Coral Gables, Florida on Wednesday night and decided to look around the house at 2.30am on Thursday.

They walked through an unlocked door and into the $11 million home - later insisting that they did not think anyone was living at the home because Allen no longer plays for the Florida team.

Break in: Seven teenagers walked into this Coral Gables, Florida home owned by Ray Allen on Thursday morning because they thought it would be 'cool' to see where he lived, police said

But Allen's wife, Shannon Walker Allen, and their children were asleep upstairs. Mrs Allen heard the teens enter the home, police spokeswoman Kelly Denham told the Miami Herald.

'She heard people walking up the stairs 
and that's when she yelled out to them, "What are you doing in my 
house?"' Denham said. 'As soon as they heard that, they fled the house.'

The teenagers told some parents what had happened, and the adults drove them to the police station to report the incident.

Denham said that the teenagers admitted they had been inside the home.

'They were there to see where Ray Allen had lived,' she said. 'They honestly thought that he had moved from the house.'

Concerns: Allen, who is a free agent who has played with the Miami Heat for the past two years (left), was not at home but his wife Shannon, pictured together right, heard the intruders and yelled out to them

She explained that the teenagers saw boxes inside the home and thought that Allen had moved out because he no longer plays for the Heat.

The sportsman has played for the team for two years but is a free agent and has not yet revealed whether or not he will play for another year.

Dunham said that officers questioned the teens but released them because there was no forced entry, no intent and nothing was taken.

But she added that Allen's wife intends to file trespassing charges - and that the youngsters were well aware of what they had done.

'They were crying,' she told NBC. 'They were terrified.'

Earlier this year, the South Florida Business Journal reported that the athlete had bought the 11,533-square-foot mansion for $11 million.

The 10-bedroom home also has a private beach, a library, marble and wood flooring, an elevator, an exercise room, a sauna and a spa bath, the paper reported.
