A group of teenagers have been filmed brawling in front of shocked train commuters.

The fight on an Adelaide train started when two boys began to throw punches at each other in the middle of the carriage.

Footage shows onlookers yelling out for them to stop before a teenage girl jumps in and uses her foot to stop down on one of the boy's heads.

'Should we break it up? Break it up,' a commuter can be heard yelling. 

About three adult men try to separate the brawling teens, but a young man then turns on them as he tries to start another fight.

The girl who was filmed stomping on a boy's head can be seen standing protectively over her friend as he sits in the corner despite others still trying to hit him. 

Footage of the incident ended when friends of one of the boys started pushing him through the doors when the train pulled onto the platform. 

The video was uploaded to Facebook but it is not known where it took place.
