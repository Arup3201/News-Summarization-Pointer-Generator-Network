The first photographs of Helena Skelly, 19, and Phil Culling, 41, together

The deputy headmaster and the teenage former pupil whose  affair brought scandal to a leading public school have been seen together for the first time since news of their relationship broke.

Phil Culling, 41, went to an acoustic gig where aspiring musician Helena Skelly, 19, was performing.

He watched adoringly as she sang about forbidden love.

Before Friday night’s show, attended by around 30 fans, the pair shared an intimate kiss.

And 
throughout her 40-minute set, Mr Culling smiled encouragingly as Miss 
Skelly, wearing a short lacy dress and high heels, played guitar and 
sang about heartbreak.

He passed her drinks and chatted with her 
friends

She
 told the audience at The Troubadour, in Earls Court, west London that 
since the scandal broke, ‘I’ve had to delete all my social media, which 
is the worst time to play a gig.’

She
 said one song was ‘about wanting relationships to work out but not 
knowing how they’re going to go,’ while another  mentioned ‘the love of 
my life, but only to borrow.’

After
 the performance, she sat on his lap at the venue, which has previously 
played host to Bob Dylan, Adele and The Rolling Stones’ Ronnie Wood.

Later she smoked cigarettes and chatted to friends while he sat quietly.

The pair left at 10.45pm with him carrying her guitar.

An onlooker said: ‘At first I thought he was her father but then they kissed.

The way he looked at her while she performed looked like a man besotted.

She gave him coquettish looks while she sang and it all seemed a bit odd.’

Parents at the £17,000-a-year Godolphin and Latymer School  in Hammersmith last month received an email from headmistress Ruth Mercer, saying that Mr Culling had ‘resigned his position as deputy head with immediate effect’.

She added: ‘His position had become untenable. The right thing for him to do was to leave.’

Following 
the scandal, Miss Skelly’s mother Georgina Clark denied her daughter had
 been in a ‘sexual or physical’ relationship with the teacher, saying: 
‘I utterly believe my daughter when she says that there is nothing going
 on between her and Mr Culling. She’s devastated by all this.’

The
 school confirmed ‘a teacher has resigned/left the school  having failed
 to maintain the high standards of behaviour we expect’ but had nothing 
further to add.

Miss Skelly declined to comment.

Helena Skelly was a former pupil at The Godolphin and Latymer School where Phil Culling was the deputy headmaster. The school motto is an ancient Cornish phrase, Francha Leale Toge, which translates as 'free and loyal art thou'
