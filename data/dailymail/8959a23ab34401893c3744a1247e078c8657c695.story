David Bentley readily admits that he fell out with every manager he played for — often because they felt he had an unsuitable attitude for a modern footballer.

But as he recalls playing for the likes of Arsene Wenger, Mark Hughes and Harry Redknapp and explains why he decided to retire from football aged just 29, Bentley hardly appears to be someone with a problem.

It was bold, maybe foolhardy, to give up potentially millions in earnings and a dream profession, but Bentley spent his entire career struggling with the restraints of the game.

‘Football was a sport I loved to play,’ Bentley recounts, his partner and three young children waiting nearby.

‘I did it for enjoyment. You express yourself. When you get to the top level it becomes a job.

‘There were a lot of reasons why at certain times I didn’t play. My point of view clashed with others. I fell out with pretty much every manager. They have five games now to save their job (so) if they see someone laughing and joking and having fun all the time, it might look like you’re not serious about saving their job.’

Growing up, Bentley viewed football differently. He looked up to players who, in his view, broke free from the commercial, PR-driven agenda which, he believes, shackles English players.

His idols were Paul Scholes and Eric Cantona. His favourite player was Paul Gascoigne. Bentley was fascinated by their charisma and stage presence.

‘I always looked at how players were as people, as a sort of performer,’ he says, ‘Their stage presence was unbelievable. They could touch the ball four times but I loved watching them.

‘Nowadays you don’t see character and charisma. Every team plays the same, every player does the same thing. You aren’t going to remember any of them. Even the best players in the world — they just do their job and they’re a brand, controlled by an army behind them.

‘I was never really good at that. My flaw was I’d never touch my toes and take it like a good boy.’

It was April 1, 2013 when Bentley knew it was all over. He had gone back on loan to Blackburn  Rovers and was starting a Championship match against Cardiff City. But it just did not feel right any more. He knew it was not what he wanted. It was his last game of professional football.

‘I’d gone back to Blackburn to try to get ignited again, to love the game again,’ he remembers. ‘And I just thought, it’s not for me. I’d stopped enjoying it. I knew I wasn’t going to do it again.’

Bentley spoke to his agent, Rob Segal — who he had been with since he was 15 — and friends and family about the decision.

It is now all about family for Bentley. He has a stake in La Sala, a restaurant chain in Marbella which is soon to expand to England, but his partner Kim, daughter Devon and his newborn twins are his life now.

The family have moved to Marbella, although they came back for a spell so the twins would be born in England.

He arrives for this interview at a Buckinghamshire hotel pushing the twins in a double pram, his wife and daughter in tow and with a big smile on his face.

Devon interrupts early in our discussion to try to get daddy to come and play.

‘I’ve got work to do,’ he says. Then asks: ‘How much do you love me out of 10?’

Devon holds up 10 fingers. ‘Is that all?’ he asks again. She gives him a big hug.

As a young player, Bentley had it all. He trained with Arsenal’s Invincibles aged just 16 — having joined the north London club at 13 — playing alongside footballing greats Dennis Bergkamp, Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira and Robert Pires. Under Wenger’s tutelage he was tipped to become the best player of his generation.

His ability had him labelled the new David Beckham by then-England manager Steve McClaren.

And Beckham seconded that view.

Bentley played with flair and without fear, never afraid to try a trick and able to land a ball on a sixpence from 60 yards.

Promise: Bentley showed signs of brilliance as a teenager for Arsenal and during a loan spell at Norwich

With that mixture of attitude and talent, he scored terrific goals — such as the 40-yard volley against Arsenal shortly after moving to Tottenham, one of the moments for which he will be most remembered.

But Bentley could not force his way through at Arsenal and, as an ambitious 19-year-old, he wanted to play. After a loan spell at Norwich City, he found his calling at Blackburn. That was where he was happiest in football, in his first spell there. He initially signed on loan before making the move permanent on the final day of the transfer window in January 2006.

The next day, he struck the first Premier League hat-trick conceded by Manchester United to stun them in a 4-3 victory.

At Blackburn he became a star and amid interest from United, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea, he signed a long-term deal.

‘It was a good environment,’ recalls Bentley. ‘There was an old-school mentality. There was a family feel to it, I enjoyed going in. There were a lot of characters there: Robbie Savage, Dominic Matteo, David Thompson, Garry Flitcroft.

‘Every day it didn’t matter what the score was, who was better at this or that, everyone enjoyed being there, enjoyed each other’s company.’

But that all evaporated when he became the £15million man at Tottenham in July 2008, a figure which had the potential to rise to £17m with add-ons. It was a hefty price-tag for a 23-year-old.

He signed a mammoth, five-year deal with wages in the region of £50,000 per week. Within a week he realised it was the complete opposite of what he had left behind at Ewood Park.

‘It was a difficult environment,’ he explains. ‘I had my opinion of football and I walked into the complete opposite of that. I didn’t see it coming.’

It failed to work there and four loan spells followed — including becoming the first English player to grace the Russian Premier League at FC Rostov — before he was substituted in the 62nd minute of that game against Cardiff and it was all over.

From the very start, seeds of disillusion were already germinating. However much he loved playing, Bentley hated the element of control which plagues the modern game. Being told what to say, what to wear, where to go, when to do it — do this, be here, say that.

Bentley believes this cripples ability and expression on the field.

‘It’s why England fail,’ he explains. ‘That’s why we’ll never produce players. It’s about the mindset of the English game.

‘You look at Ross Barkley or Raheem Sterling; do you think Neymar or James Rodriguez are much better? Are they genetically built better? Or is it just in their mind?

‘When Neymar or Rodriguez go out on the field they’re relaxed. They love to play, with their heart. Young English players are mentally polluted so they can’t express themselves.

‘England will always struggle at major tournaments until somebody comes in to change the whole  system. I played at every England youth level going and it was exactly the same.’

Bentley captained England U18s, was called up to play an England B match after a scintillating season in 2006-07 at Blackburn and was soon in the senior side. But his England period, when he won seven caps, was mired in controversy.

Pedigree: Bentley appeared for the England senior team seven times during his career

In 2007, he was called up by Stuart Pearce for the U21 squad to play in the European Championship but pulled out, citing the need to rest.

It went down dreadfully in England’s upper echelons and McClaren punished him by exclusion from a friendly against Germany. When he eventually made his senior debut against Israel, some England fans booed him.

He laughs it off and adds: ‘It’s the control element in football that’s difficult to handle every day. These days it’s a business. It’s your job. I never saw it that way.

‘I’m so grateful for the game and what it gave me, especially financially, but I never wanted to play like that.

‘I’d coach my kids’ teams but I’d never go back to professional football. I don’t think it can be changed. It’s like politics now.’

People stop Bentley in the street and ask him why he’s packed it all in, given up the flow of riches, the dream.

But, with a shrug, he responds: ‘I just tell them I’m happy.’
