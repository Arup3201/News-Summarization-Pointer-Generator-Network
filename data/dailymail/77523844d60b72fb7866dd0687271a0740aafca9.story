Twelve puppies found living in their own filth while locked inside an underground bunker have been rescued from a cruel puppy farm.

Sought after breeds, including King Charles spaniels, labradors and German shepherds were kept three metres below ground in darkness with no fresh air, by a 43-year-old woman in Western Australia.

'The smell emanating from this is quite overpowering,' said an RSPCA rescuer as he lifted the lid of the bunker.

Saved: 12 puppies were found locked up inside an underground bunker in countryside WA in January

Locked up: The dogs were kept in squalid conditions three metres below ground

Frantic: The puppies can be seen climbing up the walls in an RSPCA video. They look desperate to escape   

Fifty dogs in total were saved from a hidden country side farm in South Doodlakine, on January 24, 2012.

Katherine Lisa King had already been banned from owning an animal for a decade in 2004, so she moved her sick money making puppy farm underground in what is believed to be an attempt to avoid detection.

The horrific animal cruelty was filmed in an RSPCA rescue video.

The puppies can be seen yelping for help, as the small circular lid to their underground kennel is lifted.

A frantic brown and white King Charles spaniel can be seen desperately trying to jump up towards the bunker's exit.

They were found living on a floor littered with dirty old newspaper.

A yellow bucket of brown food was placed against the wall.

Many of the 50 dogs were sick with infections including ear mite and secondary infections resulting from failure to treat the conditions by taking the animals to a vet.

Cruel: The dogs had no daylight and dirty old newspaper surrounded them

Shocking: The circular entrance to the puppy bunker was well hidden on the farmland

The popular breeds, which also included west highland terriers and Tibetan terriers, were roughly segregated in different areas of the property.

Amanda Swift of the RSPCA told Seven News: 'It was difficult for us to find, it was well hidden. The dogs were down there... we don't know for how long.'

The puppies were to be sold at high prices in pet shops and online.

Ms King was found guilty on three counts of animal cruelty in Perth Magistrates Court on Thursday and fined $11,000.

She has also been banned from going within 10 metres of any animal for five years and was ordered to pay $20,000 in costs.

'The dogs had been placed in an alien and terrible environment and should never have been placed in the underground bunker,' Magistrate Stephen Wilson said, WA Today reported.

'There was no sunlight, no fresh air or flow of air and there was a stench emanating from the when her current banning order expires from bunker,' he said.
