The stepson of notorious former gangster Dave Courtney has been shot dead in a suspected gangland assassination over a drugs debt.

Genson Courtney, 23, was ambushed as he got into his VW Golf outside his girlfriend's home in Greenwich, south-east London.

The victim, whose stepfather has written books about gangland violence, was blasted by a lone gunman in the head and shoulder before his assailant fled on foot.

Dave Courtney was born in Bermondsey, London, in 1959.

The 52-year-old has made a name for himself through his supposed affiliation with famous hardmen such as Reggie Kray.

He was only nine when the Krays were jailed, but claims to have arranged security for Ronnie Kray's funeral in 1995.

Courtney became infamous as a knuckle-duster wielding debt collector, and claims to have been shot, stabbed and had his nose almost bitten off.

He claims to have been found not guilty in 19 separate trials but in January 2009 he was given an 18-month conditional discharge at Bristol Crown Court, on a charge of possessing live ammunition without a firearms certificate.

In 2004 he was cleared of attacking his wife Jennifer Pinto over an alleged lesbian affair.

Four years earlier, he walked free from the Old Bailey after he was cleared of being part of a plot to plant cocaine on an innocent woman.

During the trial he was named as a registered police informant using the alias 'Tommy Mack'.

But Courtney insisted he simply took advantage of the system to disguise a relationship with a corrupt detective.

'I have never been a grass,' he said.

He is also known to have spent time in Belmarsh prison.

In recent times he has become something of a celebrity figure, making a living from appearances in numerous television documentaries and a number of low-budget British gangster films. He also starred in, directed and produced his own film, Hell To Pay.

Courtney has published six books - including titles such as Dodgy Dave's Little Black Book - and recorded a version of 'I Fought The Law' with Scottish pop-punks Mute.

He refers to himself as Dave Courtney OBE – 'One Big Ego' - and has a painted depiction of himself as a knight in his south London house (pictured above).

He was taken to hospital but was pronounced dead at 3.43am.

The
street where Genson, a cagefighter, was killed is a five-minute walk from the terraced 
house used in a 1990 film based on the lives and crimes of the Kray 
twins, in which his stepfather starred.

It is also only a short distance from London's O2 Arena.

Police suspect a major drugs baron owed thousands of pounds by Genson ordered his execution just before 11pm on Sunday.

There is also a theory he could have been lured to the area after being caught up in an ongoing feud between gangs.

Yesterday his 52-year-old stepfather said he was ‘shell-shocked’ by the murder.

The self-styled gangster spoke 
outside the family home in Plumstead, South London, which is named 
‘Camelot Castle’ and decorated with Union Jack flags and a large painted
depiction of himself as a knight with a large knuckle-duster.

Courtney said: ‘I’m shell-shocked. 
Police have been here all day and they are inside now so I don’t want to
say anything other than I’m devastated.’

He then told The Sun: 'He (Genson) was a proper little solja and I was proud of him.

'If anyone needed an advert to say crime doesn't pay then let Genson be that advert.

'We were close - and even shared a cell when we were both in jail earlier this year.'

He pleaded for calm as police feared a gang war could erupt over the killing.

A family friend said the victim’s mother Jenny, a singer, was inconsolable.

She said: ‘The family are in bits. Jenny is talking to the police now and there have been a lot of tears.

'I don’t know what could have brought this on.

‘Genson was such a nice boy, always going to the gym.’ 

Police were investigating last night whether the victim knew his killer.

Officers were quizzing his family and friends about his last movements.

Neighbours told yesterday how they 
saw two black men speeding in a black VW Golf in the area 
moments before the victim was shot dead in the same vehicle, believed to
be a hire car.

Detectives fear that the killing may unleash a wave of ‘tit-for-tat’ retribution attacks.

Genson's stepfather, known as ‘Dodgy 
Dave’, revels in his image as a violent hardman and claims to be the 
inspiration behind Vinnie Jones’s role as the debt collector in the 
movie, Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels.

The former debt collector has written
a number of books about his underworld exploits in which he claims to 
have been shot, stabbed and had his nose bitten off.

Courtney, who was jailed in the 
Eighties for attacking five men with a meat cleaver, also boasts that he
has been involved in assault and murder.

He often focuses on his links with 
Reggie Kray and the infamous criminal Lenny McLean and is said to be a 
central figure in a loose collection of villains who refer to themselves
as The Firm.

Celebrity-gangster figure Courtney claims to have been involved in assault, murder and debt-collecting, for which he gained a reputation for using a knuckle-duster

This year it was reported that the 
author, who refers to himself as Courtney OBE which stands for ‘One Big 
Ego', had landed a £15million deal to star in three Hollywood movies.

Like his father, Genson was no stranger to police.

His father’s website reveals how at 
the age of 15, Genson was forced to live rough on the streets when his 
parents briefly split up around 2004.

The troubled teenager, who attended 
Eaglesfield School in Woolwich, committed a number of offences before 
moving back in with his stepfather a year later.

Yesterday friends and 
family left flowers at the scene.

One friend said: ‘He was a gentle giant - the nicest bloke you could ever meet’.

Detective Chief Inspector Mark Gower 
from the Met’s gun crime unit, Trident said: ‘At this early stage it is
believed a male suspect may have run from the scene in the direction of
Christchurch Way, SE10, shortly after the shooting.

‘I am appealing to anyone who may have seen or heard anything suspicious to contact the police.

‘I would like to reassure anyone 
concerned about contacting the police that Trident has great expertise 
in protecting witnesses and there are a huge variety of measures that 
can be put in place to protect you.’

The street where Genson was killed is a five-minute walk from the terraced house used in a 1990 film based on the lives and crimes of the Kray twins, which his step-father starred in
