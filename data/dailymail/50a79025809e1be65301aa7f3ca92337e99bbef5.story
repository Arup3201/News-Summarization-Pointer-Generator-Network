Generally speaking, rugby is a young man's game. Unfortunately, no one seems to have told Vince Cable.

The 71-year-old took a tumble as he joined in a training session with school children at Twickenham Academy yesterday. 

His visit, with party leader Nick Clegg, comes ahead of perhaps the biggest year yet for British rugby with the arrival of the World Cup.

Mr Cable, Lib Dem Business Secretary and MP for Twickenham, was unhurt in the fall and laughed it off with the young players.

The MP for Twickenham later tweeted: 'Great fun seeing @EnglandRugby outreach work in Twickenham getting young people involved in rugby ahead of World Cup'. 

The visit came as the England rugby team are due to face Wales in the Six Nations on Friday.

The Lib Dems are also celebrating the 2015 Rugby World Cup which will start in September and be hosted across 11 cities and 13 venues - from Brighton to Newcastle.

The party says the global event will support 12,000 jobs, add £2.2 billion to the UK economy, and create a lasting legacy.

Mr Clegg - who left the pitch unscathed - said: 'We all remember the incredible success of the 2012 Olympics and the 2014 Grand Départ of the Tour de France in Yorkshire. They both left a legacy that the whole country can be proud of.

'This year, we have the privilege of hosting the Rugby World Cup and it promises to the biggest ever for English rugby.

'Not only will it bring billions of pounds to our economy and create thousands of jobs but it will leave a lasting legacy, building on the work here at the Twickenham Academy, inspiring youngsters from every background to pick up a ball.

'I want to wish the England team the best of luck in the year ahead. Lets make 2015 another great sporting year for this country.'
