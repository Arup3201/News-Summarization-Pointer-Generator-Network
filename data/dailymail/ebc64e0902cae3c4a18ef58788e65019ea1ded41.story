A high-flying Morgan Stanley wealth manager has been accused of secretly filing sexual encounters with multiple women in his tony Upper East Side bachelor pad.

John Kelly shot videos of his sexcapades with three different women between September 2011 and December 2012, officials said. Revelations of the conduct drove one woman to trash his apartment.

The women were in his apartment at separate times, the New York Daily News noted.

‘In this case, the defendant videotaped three unrelated women while they were performing sexual acts on him in his home,’ said prosecutor Siobhan Carthy during the financier’s arraignment, the paper reported.

He faces three charges of second-degree unlawful surveillance, each of which carries a maximum four-year prison sentence.

‘Defendant did surreptitiously video record informant engaged in sexual contact with defendant and such images show informant’s breasts,’ said a criminal complaint cited by the Daily News.

Victims ‘did not consent to such images being recorded and defendant did not have permission or authority to record or possess such images,’ the complaint continued.

The breasts, buttocks and vagina of one of the victims could be clearly seen in the video, officials said.

One of the women who found out about the secret recordings broke into Mr Kelly’s apartment, according to the Daily News. She trashed the place, poured soda onto his computer and was charged with burglary, but that case should be dismissed, the paper noted.

Mr Kelly has ‘no arrests, no problems with the law, and an exemplary background,’ his attorney Robert Gotleib told the Daily News.

He is free on $5,000 bail and had to surrender his passport. His next scheduled court date is March 11, court records showed.
