At around 100 calories a glass, champagne can be a fattening, as well as a rather expensive, habit.

The issue wasn’t lost on BBC broadcaster Amanda Thomson. And she became so obsessed with creating a low sugar fizz that she gave up her job to pursue the dream.

Four years on, she has launched Skinny Champagne – at 60 calories a glass.

It was 2010 when Miss Thomson left her £50,000 a year job to move with her husband and two children to Paris to study wine making.

She has spent the past 18 months developing her product and worked with champagne maker Alexandre Penet to create the Brut Nature Cuvée Grand Cru.

Sugar is usually added to champagne at the end of the fermentation process to balance the taste. 

There is no added sugar in Skinny Champagne and the only sweetness comes from the residual fruit sugars of the grape.

Low sugar champagne is not a new idea – but those that do exist often come with a sky-high price tag. 

Miss Thomson said: ‘No one was focusing on it, it needed some love. I made it my mission to find a perfect low sugar champagne.’

Skinny Champagne is now stocked at the exclusive Nobu restaurants in London and on her website Thomson and Scott for £249 for a case of six.
