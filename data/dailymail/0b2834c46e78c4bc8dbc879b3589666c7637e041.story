At nearly a stone, she is twice the weight of the average newborn girl.

But even more remarkable is that Jasleen’s mother managed to deliver her naturally, without the need for a Caesarean section.

She was born on Friday in Leipzig, Germany, weighing 13lb 8oz (6.11kg) and measuring 23in (57.5 cm) long.

Germany's heaviest newborn: Jasleen weighed in at 13lb 8oz when she was born in Leipzig last month

The mother, who gave birth at University Hospital in Leipzig, discovered she had a previously undiagnosed case of gestational diabetes which can lead to a larger than usual birth weight

Her mother Maria, 31, who turned up at the hospital on the day of the birth, said: ‘I was somewhat shocked at her size.

‘My 11-year-old daughter was a third of her weight, my two-year-old son a little under that.

'My stomach was a lot bigger this time around but I had no idea there was such a giant inside.’

Doctors discovered that the mother was suffering from undiagnosed gestational diabetes which can cause abnormally big babies.

Jasleen is Germany’s heaviest, 
beating a 13lb boy called Jihad born in November 2011, but is 10lb 
lighter than the world record.

She is doing well but remains in neonatal intensive care at Leipzig University Hospital while doctors monitor her.

1. The biggest baby ever recorded was born in Canada to mother Anna Bates in 1879. Mrs Bates and her husband martin were 7’5” and 7’11” respectively.

They had a baby boy that weighed 23lb. 12 oz, but sadly he died 11 hours later.

2. In 2005 a Brazilian woman gave birth to a 17lb baby boy named Admilton does Santos.

He was mother Francisca’s fifth child and it is thought that his size was also caused by diabetes.

Admilton was given glucose at birth due to his mother’s condition.Her four other children were all born at normal weights.

3. In March of this year a British couple welcomed the second largest baby ever to be born in the UK.

Little George King weighed 12lb and 7oz, more than double the average for a newborn, at Gloucester Royal Infirmary.

He arrived two weeks late and was born naturally, but no-one had expected Jade to have a baby so large.

She said: ‘He was a surprise — a big surprise, as it turned out.’

4. A Texan family welcomed 16lb 1oz  JaMichael Brown in 2011, who is believed to have been the largest born in the state.

He was 24 inches long, his head measured 15 inches and his chest, 17 inches.

Mother Janet said: ‘I can’t believe he’s that big. A lot of the baby clothes we bought for him will have to be returned. They’re already too small for him to wear.'

Not-so-little JaMichael also came out with a full head of hair and the hospital did not have diapers big enough to fit him.

Father, Michael Brown said he had high hopes his son would become a footballer.

Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that affects women during pregnancy.

Up to five per cent of women giving birth in England and Wales has diabetes. Most of these women have gestational diabetes, but some have type 1 or type 2 diabetes. 

In most cases, gestational diabetes develops in the third trimester - after 28 weeks - and usually disappears after the baby is born.

Diabetes is a condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood.

Normally, the amount of glucose in the blood is controlled by a hormone called insulin. But during pregnancy, some women have higher than normal levels of glucose in their blood and their body cannot produce enough insulin to transport it all into the cells.

This means that the level of glucose in the blood rises. 

Gestational diabetes can be controlled with diet and exercise but some women will need medication to control blood glucose levels.

If gestational diabetes is not detected and controlled, it can increase the risk of birth complications, such as babies being large for their gestational age known as macrosomia.

Macrosomia is a term used to describe babies when they are born weighting more than 8.8lb.It occurs because the excess glucose in the mother’s blood is passed to the unborn baby.

This causes the foetus to produce the growth hormone insulin that allows glucose to enter the cells, which results in growth. 

Macrosomia can lead to a condition called shoulder dystocia. This is when the baby’s head passes through the vagina, but your baby’s shoulder gets stuck in the mother's pelvis  during birth.

This can be dangerous as a baby may not be able to breathe while they are stuck. It is estimated to affect 1 in 200 births.

Other complications relating to gestation diabetes include risk of premature birth, neonatal hypoglycaemia – when a newborn has low blood glucose, which can cause poor feeding, blue-tinged skin and irritability - and perinatal death, the death of the baby shortly after birth.
