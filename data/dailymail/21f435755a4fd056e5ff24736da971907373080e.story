Free: David Bolam (pictured in an undated YouTube video) has been released after being captured by Islamic militants in Libya five months ago

The British teacher held hostage for five months in Libya was released after a ransom was paid to militants, a report claims today.

David Bolam, 53, who was principal at the International School in the coastal city of Benghazi, was abducted in May, but it was not reported at the request of the government and his family.

A source said his release came after 'negotiations involving local political factions', but BBC News reports that money was handed over to his captors.

A ransom demand had been made to the school, according to the report, but it was unclear how much was paid and who raised the cash.

Mr Bolam flew back to the UK on Thursday night. His freedom came as Islamic State militants in Syria killed a second British hostage after the UK government refused to pay for their release.

A video purporting to show the beheading of taxi driver Alan Henning, from Salford, Greater Manchester, was circulated on the Internet on Friday. Mr Henning was snatched by militants while delivering aid in the IS-occupied city of Al-Dana. 

His killing came three weeks after a video was published purporting to show the beheading of another British aid worker, David Haines, who was abducted while accessing refugee camps in the north of Syria.

Since Mr Henning's murder, his family have accused the government of not doing enough to try to rescue him or otherwise secure his release.  

In August, a group of rebel militants called Jaysh al-Islam – Army of Islam – issued a video of Mr Bolam, from Craven Arms, Shropshire, appealing to David Cameron to help with his release.

Looking haggard and having grown a long beard, he said he had been held for a ‘very long time’ but that his health was ‘good’.

He also mentioned a prisoner swap by the United States – most likely referring to the exchange of five Afghan Taliban officials for US soldier Bowe Bergdahl.

He stated: ‘I ask the British Government and Prime Minister David Cameron: Please, please, please do the same to allow me to go home, back to my family.

‘And I ask my family and friends and anyone else who hears this: Please can you do something to let the Government understand I need to go home soon.

'Please, please do something to help me.’

Since the fall of former Libyan dictator Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, Benghazi, where the uprising began, has been left a lawless place where Islamist militias do battle with criminal gangs.

In 2012, the U.S. envoy to the city was killed when militants stormed the consulate, setting fire to the building, in protest over a film they believed insulted their religion.

A former teacher at the International School in Benghazi said most other teachers had left after a 'massive gunfight' near the grounds and the fatal shooting of a colleague.

Ged O'Connor Challis told BBC News said Mr Bolam had stayed on when others left because he 'believed in what he was doing.'

He called Mr Bolam 'single-minded and stubborn' but added: 'He is a very bright person. He is an English teacher - one of the best I have ever met.'

The Foreign Office said in a statement: ‘We are glad that David Bolam is safe and well after his ordeal, and that he has been reunited with his family.

'We have been supporting his family since he was taken. We do not comment on the detail of hostage cases.’

A source told the Telegraph that if a ransom had been paid it could encourage future kidnappings.

They added: 'This is not an easy policy to follow - sometimes it is agonising - but it is right.' 

The Foreign Office was reportedly not involved in the ransom negotiations that secured his release.
