A super-fit mum has come under fire for 'fat-shaming' women - after she posted a picture of her six-pack on Instagram.

Fitness fanatic, Abby Pell, 33, from East Grinstead, East Sussex, thought she was helping encourage others to lose post-pregnancy weight when she shared the picture of her posing with her daughter.

She included the message 'I have a kid, a six pack and no excuse.'

Abby Pell posted this picture of her and her six-year-old daughter Bella on Instagram and was met by a barrage of abuse accusing the mother-of-one of fat shaming 

But instead of support, the mum-of-one was branded 'shameless' by scores of people and met with abuse from her followers. 

One web user wrote: 'This is so demeaning - I bet she doesn't have to work for a living.' 

Another added: 'This is fat shaming, pure and simple. Exploiting your motherhood to show off is despicable and shameless.' 

Dedicated mum Abby manages to juggle motherhood and running her own nutrition business while still hitting the gym up to six days a week.

'I was on the heavier side so I tried a range of weight loss plans like The Atkins Diet and the South Beach Diet and just generally restricting my daily calorie allowance.

'But I would always end up so hungry I'd get to the point where I couldn't bear to starve myself any longer.

Abby piled on the pounds while she was pregnant reaching 13st when she was pregnant with her daughter and has now slimmed down to 9st after she took up weight training 

The personal trainer from East Sussex was shocked to be accused of 'fat-shaming' and says that she never meant to offend anyone with her photo

'And as soon as I gave in the weight would go straight back on.'

Abby turned to intense weight training taking just a year to sculpt her impressive abs, after she ballooned to 13 stone when she was pregnant with daughter Bella, now six, and struggled to lose shed the extra 50lb.  

'I decided to have just one last push, so I started lifting weights, and I was astonished at the results that came so quickly.

'My bum was firmer, arms more defined and my abs were showing.

'Now going to the gym is where I have my 'me-time,' which all mums know they need.'

Abby, who now weighs 9st and is a size eight, says she feels better now than before she was pregnant.

The personal trainer was immensely proud of her achievements and naturally wanted to share success with her friends and family. 

Abby was aiming to inspire other mothers to shape up after pregnancy rather than anger them as she believes that having a child is no excuse for being inactive and overweight

Abby only put the picture of her flat stomach, complete with the offending caption, after her proud daughter told her that she looked like Wonder Woman.

'One day Bella said to me, 'You look like Wonder Woman, Mummy.' That's what gave me the idea for the Instagram picture.'

Abby was expecting the picture to cause a stir but was stunned with the amount of negativity she received.

'I never meant to offend anyone - my life is better now that I'm in shape, so I hoped I could encourage others to do the same.

'It's a sorry state of affairs when someone's healthy passion is labelled abusive, whilst obesity, junk food marketing and laziness are all on the rise. You keep going.'

Abby, who posts pictures on Twitter and Instagram under the name @SuperAbs, reckons that if just one person takes up her advice, it will be worth it.

'There were some positive messages congratulating me on working hard but they were mostly negative, criticising me for fat-shaming and adding pressure on mums to look fantastic.

'I'm not saying the nasty comments are jealousy, but it might be that these people are insecure in the way that they look.'

The 33-year-old added that when it comes to shaping up too many people rely on dubious reasons not to.  

Abby believes that just because you're a mother that doesn't mean you should give up on fitness 

'Some people want to be able to make excuses and don't like it when an alternative body type is put in their face. 

'Having a child is not a valid reason for being out of shape. Everybody can make excuses. I want to show that this figure is achievable.

'It doesn't matter if you're overweight, if you have a busy lifestyle and kids to look after - if you want to do it then there's always a way.

'Being a mum doesn't mean you have to give up.'

Abby added that even people who are extremely fit don't have the perfect body. 

'You can have stretch marks and a great figure - I'm so proud of my body and I want other people to be proud of their bodies too.'
