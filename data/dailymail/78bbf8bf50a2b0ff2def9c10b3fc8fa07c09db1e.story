Sir Alex Ferguson, who has brought out two best-selling autobiographies, is being approached to write a management book based on his Harvard University lectures.

The demand for yet another book from the former Manchester United manager is not surprising when sports psychologist Damian Hughes can trade on his name so blatantly with his publication How to Think Like Sir Alex Ferguson.

Hughes, whose Ferguson study was the subject of an interview on Radio 4’s Today programme on Wednesday, has certainly stretched any tenuous association with either Sir Alex or Manchester United to the limit.

The promotional literature originally claimed that the author had worked closely with Ferguson when it transpires that Hughes had never talked to him about the book and now ‘can’t remember’ the dates of any of the many conversations he says he’s had with Fergie.

Hughes, a visiting Professor of Organisational Psychology at Manchester Metropolitan University, blames publishers Aurum for publicising his supposed working relationship with Ferguson and said he had that line withdrawn as soon as possible.

However, Hughes has also claimed in newspaper interviews to have been employed as a junior coach at Old Trafford working with academy players alongside Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and ‘totally immersed in a winning environment’. But United have no record of Damian Hughes whatsoever on their academy files. Hughes later confirmed his role was with Man Utd Soccer Schools.

The Fortress GB ticket scanner system installed at Twickenham is going to be a significant help with England Rugby 2015’s battle with the World Cup ticket black market — provided it works properly as it does at Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City. Glitches in the system led to huge queues to get into the stadium before Saturday’s England-All Blacks game. However, reading ticket barcodes will allow ER2015 to identify those supplied from unofficial sources and stop the holder from entering the ground.

Campbell Ogilvie poses with the William Hill Scottish Cup

Scottish FA president Campbell Ogilvie  might still mount a home nations challenge for the British vice-president’s seat on the FIFA executive committee which is destined to be won by England candidate David Gill in the UEFA election next March. But even in almost certain defeat, Ogilvie is sure to be a lot more media friendly than Gill, who frequently treats the press with disdain.

Meanwhile, it has emerged that Manchester United’s Gill was the main supporter of FA chairman Greg Dyke’s desire not to use headhunters to find the successor to general secretary Alex Horne until persuaded otherwise.

The ultra-commercialisation of England rugby internationals at Twickenham included former England captain Roger Uttley being photographed with fans next to the Rugby World Cup to help promote packages being sold for the tournament by the RFU-owned England Rugby Travel Club.

Dowd is alleged to have had favourable treatment

Dowd in the spotlight

Top referee Phil Dowd  is the latest official to face allegations from within the referees’ fraternity that he has received favourable treatment from the beleaguered Professional Game Match Officials Ltd.

This follows calls for PGMO boss Mike Riley to be replaced in the continued fall-out from the Mark Clattenburg affair. Clattenburg was suspended for a game after leaving a match in his own car rather than the official vehicle and taking a call from Crystal Palace manager Neil Warnock, but others have allegedly escaped punishment for similar breaches of regulations.

It has been claimed that Dowd, who failed a fitness test at the end of the 2011-12 season before losing a noticeable amount of weight, didn’t pass a test at the start of this season. But he was allowed to carry on officiating after passing another test, which was quickly arranged with PGMO sports scientist Simon Brevik away from the usual venues.

The PGMO insist Dowd did not fail a ‘test’, but they would not comment about him starting the test exercise but not being able to complete it because of injury. The PGMO added there is no designated location for fitness tests.
