Natasha Smyth, 43, from Fawley, Hampshire, fell over while carrying a young child after drinking a bottle and a half of wine

A child suffered a 'horrible' head injury after being dropped by an adult who had drunk five glasses of wine.

Natasha Smyth, 43, from Fawley, Hampshire, tumbled in wet weather while holding the child, leaving it with a serious cut to the back of the head. 

The infant - who cannot be named for legal reasons - was also found to have bruising under the chin. 

Smyth initially denied being drunk when she fell.

But after several police interviews, Smyth admitted drinking about one and a half bottles of wine - the equivalent of five glasses - in a pub before going to collect the child.

The woman, who was said to have a 'drink problem', pleaded guilty at Southampton Magistrates' Court to being drunk in a public place with a child under the age of seven.

The court heard how paramedics were called to treat the child who was left with a cut head after the fall.

The infant was also found to have bruising under its chin.

When police arrived, they described the woman as being ‘in drink’.

Defence solicitor David Adams said Smyth had been going to counselling for her drinking since the incident.

He said she felt 'huge remorse' for what had happened.

Mr Adams said: 'It was a horrible injury and something Miss Smyth feels huge remorse about.

Smyth pleaded guilty at Southampton Magistrates' Court, pictured above, to being drunk in a public place with a child aged under seven. She was given a conditional discharge

'This is a lady with a drink problem who has accidentally fallen by trying to do too much in difficult weather conditions.

'She accepts responsibility for what she has done and knows to a point she has a problem.'

The child received no long-standing effects following the head injury.

Magistrates gave Smyth a conditional discharge.
