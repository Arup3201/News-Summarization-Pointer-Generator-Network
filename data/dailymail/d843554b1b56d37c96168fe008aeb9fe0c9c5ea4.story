It was a meeting of the minds, rather than fists, as David Haye sat for breakfast with former heavyweight rival Vital Klitschko on Thursday.

Haye uploaded a photo via his Instagram account later that afternoon with the pair all smiles at a table as they dined at one of London's Park Plaza Hotels.

The 34-year-old accompanied the picture with the caption: 'Great tasty @KX_Life breakfast at the beautiful @ParkPlazaHotels with Vitali klitschko, talking all things family, politics & BIG FIGHTS 2015/16,' as the British boxer hinted that he is closer to making a comeback in the sport.

The 'Hayemaker' has not fought since his fifth-round knockout of Dereck Chisora at Upton Park in 2012.

But the popular Londoner, who faced the threat of retirement, is understood to be keen to return to the ring after a positive recuperation from reconstrcutive shoulder surgery.

Haye's dalliance with Klitschko though will raise eyebrows after their very-much public war of words in the past.

In 2009, Haye incensed the then-WBA heavyweight champion and his younger brother Wladimir by sporting a T-shirt of him holding aloft the severed heads of the Ukrainian duo as he sought a fight with either sibling.

Two years later, Haye finally got his wish as he fought Wladimir in a unification bout for for the WBA, WBO, IBF, IBO and the Ring heavyweight titles.

In the build-up to that fight, which Haye lost comfortably on points, the Londoner insisted he had no regrets about that shirt hailing it one his best ever moves.

'Do I regret that T-shirt? Hell no! No way! It was one of the best things I've ever done,' he said.

'That decapitation T-shirt was one of the smartest business moves I've ever made.'

Even last year, Haye insisted his comeback to boxing would only happen if he fought either Klitschko - something Vitali was adamant would only ever happen on his terms.

'Last September [2012] I gave a proposal to David Haye to fight me in Moscow. David Haye had a contract and didn't want to do that and instead of fighting me he fought Chisora,' he said.

'How long [should] I have to wait for David Haye? I gave him a proposal and he didn't take it.

'David Haye had the chance to fight my brother. Many times he ran away but Wladimir beat him.

'David did not agree with the decision, tried to make excuses and just talked about his leg not giving him the chance to beat my brother.' 

But any hopes of Haye fighting the older Klitschko appear over for now at present, with the 43-year-old has vacating his title in December 2013 in order to focus on political matters in his homeland - where he is the current Mayor of Kiev.
