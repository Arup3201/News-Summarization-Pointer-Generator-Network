These extraordinary documents show how a real-life Dad’s Army hoped to defend their small village from any invading troops during the Second World War.

In September 1943, Lt Col Sir Morgan Crofton compiled the scrapbook of hand-drawn maps and orders to defend the picturesque village of Beaulieu, New Forest, Hampshire.

He was leading an unlikely army of farmers, doctors and drivers who clearly took their role in protecting the village, with a population of around 500, very seriously.

One map created by Lt Col Sir Morgan Crofton which details how Beaulieu, New Forest, would have been defended by the Home Guard during the war. Marked on the maps are dots where men would be stationed

Another map shows how the Dad's Army would be stationed throughout the village and where they would be able to fire snipers or machine guns in event of attack. It also shows road blocks - marked with dotted lines

The Home Guard were also responsible for defending Fawley oil 
refinery, road and rail links, and fuel supply lines through the New 
Forest National Park.

The detailed plans show how the men planned to 'harass' and 
'hinder' the approaching enemy while obeying their orders to 'hold their position to
 the last man and last round.'

Their
 sacrificial efforts were meant to give the regular British forces time 
to manouevre into a position- where they were better placed to thwart the
 attack.

However, much like the characters from the hit BBC comedy, the group would have been rather ill-equipped to cope with a potential Nazi invasion.

Historians today said the Home Guard would have had a 'cat in hells chance' of repelling an invading force.

Lt
 Col Crofton, who died in the 1950s, was originally second in command of the 9th 
(Forest) Battalion.

A typed document - with 'secret' stamped on the top - details the troops' responsibilities. It says they are to prevent airborne or seaborne raiders from damaging installations

In perhaps a comparable role to Home 
Guard company commander Captain George Mainwaring in television show Dad's Army, he later became the 
commander of the nearby 28th 
(Bay) Battalion.

His 
scrapbook contains dozens of previously unseen official documents - many
 stamped 'secret' - that he produced for his troops.

It
 contains defence plans, letters, and orders showing a series of machine
 gun posts, tank traps, road blocks, snipers and a mine field.

One of the book’s most detailed plans is a hand-drawn map showing how the pretty village of Beaulieu was turned into a defensive garrison.

In the event of an invasion, a group of 44 men were to be stationed at five pillboxes, roadblocks and numerous firing positions from local buildings.

The firing positions included the Montagu Arms - now a Michelin Star restaurant and hotel - and a wall with firing holes at Beaulieu Abbey.

Some remains can still be seen today, including four of five bunkers which can be seen in the village’s former dairy, mill, and garage.

One typed document - headed New Forest District Defence Scheme and with a red 'secret' stamp - outlines the troops’ responsibilities.

It says: 'The task of all tps (troops) under Comd (command) is to prevent enemy seaborne and or airborne raiders damaging vital Installns (installations) or equipment, and to destroy, harass, and delay any enemy who set foot in HAMPSHIRE.

'All tps will be allotted a definite role and will hold their positions to the last man and last round.

'THERE WILL BE NO WITHDRAWAL.'

Lt Col Crofton’s son, Major Edward Crofton, has now loaned the scrapbook to the New Forest Remembers World War II Project run by the New Forest National Park Authority.

Gareth Owen, from the project, said: 'We’re very grateful to the Crofton family for this unique collection full of top secret orders and maps that probably should have been destroyed once it was read.

'Yet they were kept and they offer a real insight into how the Home Guard operated in the New Forest.

'The image we have of the Home Guard, due largely to Dad’s Army, is of a shambolic if well-intentioned group playing at being soldiers.

According to the maps, men would be stationed at these gun holes in a stone wall in the village of 500

'However the documents in the Crofton book show how well-organised and dedicated the Home Guard were and how they were willing to give their lives to delay the advance of any invading German force.'

'They were of a mature age and not suited to jumping in an out of trenches but they were highly skilled individuals.

'It is unlikely they would have been much resistance to an invading force, but they would have harassed them enough to have delayed their progress, and could have given them a black eye.

'That would have been crucial in giving the full time British forces enough time to get into position further back.

'Some of the Home Guard would have known they did not have a cat in hell’s chance of beating the Germans, while others believed they could have sent them packing.

'To say they were like lambs to the slaughter is unfair, but it is likely they would have suffered casualties and were clearly prepared to sacrifice their lives if needed.'

Major Crofton, from Petersfield, Hampshire, said: 'A lot of the documents in the book were marked top secret so they probably shouldn’t have been kept.

'But knowing my father I don’t think many would have questioned him hoarding them.

'I’m very glad they were not binned. We’re very lucky.'

In the past two years, the New Forest Remembers World War II Project has unearthed more than 1,300 previously-unseen documents, maps and photos as well as record more than 72 hours of oral histories.

The entire project, including the contents of the Crofton book, has now been digitised into an online archive.

Julian Johnson, Chairman of the New Forest National Park Authority, said: 'The project has been a great success. Fascinating tales of royal visits, prisoners of war and secret bombing tests have come to light to give us a fuller picture of that time.

'The digital portal will provide a lasting legacy for future generations to discover more about this fascinating period.'
