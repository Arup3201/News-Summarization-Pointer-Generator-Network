MI5 were tracking Jihadi John before he left for the Middle East while he worked as a collector for Arab charities, it has today been reported.

Counter-terror officers had the masked executioner under surveillance while he worked as a low-level collector for the genuine charities based in London.

It comes as security sources say they are just 'days away' from revealing the identity of the British killer shown in gruesome videos beheading two U.S. hostages, released by terrorist cell ISIS.

MI5 were tracking Jihadi John before he left for the Middle East while he worked as a collector for Arab charities, it has today been reported

The Mirror reports that the executioner - one of four British jihadis known as the Beatles who are holding hostages in Syria - gathered funds for the Islamic state after he finished his work with the genuine charities.

A
 source told the paper: 'MI5 has identified this man and they have known exactly 
who he is for some time. He was even being looked at before he travelled
 abroad.

'Like
 so many jihadists before him, he then seems to have become radicalised 
almost overnight and disappeared to travel to the Middle East.'

The executioner is said to have arrived in Syria more than a year ago. 

American journalist James Foley was the first to be beheaded by the masked executioner. He is one of four British jihadis holding hostages in Syria known as the 'Beatles'

Gruesome footage of the execution of fellow American hostage Steven Sotloff was released last week

Gruesome footage showing the beheading of American journalist James Foley was released last month by the Islamic State, followed by a video of the execution of fellow American hostage Steven Sotloff last week.

Authorities are now in a race against time to save the life of British hostage, aid worker David Haines, who the masked jihadi has revealed is next for execution.

It comes after it was reported that father-of-two Mr Haines has been struggling to hold down food and suffering from acute gastric and other health problems in his cramped captivity.

Meanwhile, David Cameron has revealed that Britain has begun arming the Kurds to fight back against ISIS.

The Prime Minister told MPs, in a statement following last week’s Nato summit in Newport, that Britain ‘will continue to support the Kurds, including by providing them with arms and training their troops’.

Until now the Government has limited itself to transporting weapons from former Soviet countries to the Kurds, for example from Albania.

But Mr Cameron was asked if Britain will now be providing the Kurdish peshmerga militia directly with arms. The Prime Minister responded: ‘The short answer to that is yes.’ Britain has also offered to train the Kurdish fighters.
