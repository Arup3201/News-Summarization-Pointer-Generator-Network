Goodbye: Jill Abramson was the paper's first female editor and has been in her position since 2011

New York Times staffers received a shocker Wednesday when it was announced that editor Jill Abramson would be leaving the paper after just two and a half years in the position.

Publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr announced Abramson's replacement by managing editor Dean Baquet at a paper-wide meeting, but would not given an explanation for Abramson's dismissal or answer any questions.

A Times spokesman told AdAge that Abramson was being replaced to 'improve some aspects of management in the newsroom'. 

Abramson, 60, became the paper's first female editor its 160-year history when she was promoted from managing editor in June 2011. She was absent at Wednesday's meeting and did not pretend that she voluntarily resigned in a prepared statement.

'I've loved my run at The Times,' Abramson said in a statement provided by the company. 'I got to work with the best journalists in the world doing so much stand-up journalism.'

New Yorker reporter Ken Auletta, who profiled Abramson in 2011, wrote today that a pay gap may have been what led to the female editor's firing.

A source told the magazine that Abramson discovered a few weeks ago that her salary and pension benefits were 'considerably less' than her male predecessor, Bill Keller. 

'She confronted the top brass,' a close associate said, which may have factored into her dismissal.

Abramson will be replaced by current managing editor Dean Baquet, 57, who will be the paper's first African-American editor.

'It is an honor to be asked to lead the only newsroom in the country that is actually better than it was a generation ago, one that approaches the world with wonder and ambition every day,' Baquet said in a statement.

While some Times reporters said they were 'surprised' by the management change, trouble has been brewing at the top of the paper for some time and was chronicled in a Politico story last year.

The story starts off with an anecdote about Abramson calling Baquet into her office and blaming him for stories not being 'buzzy' enough.

Baquet storms out, punches a wall, and skips the paper's daily 4pm meeting.

Politico interviewed several staffers at the paper who described Abramson as an unpopular leader, calling her 'stubborn, condescending, and difficult to work with'.

'Every editor has a story about how she’s blown up in a meeting,' one reporter told politico.

'Jill can be impossible,' another staffer added.

'I think there’s a really easy caricature that some people have bought into, of the bitchy woman character and the guy who is sort of calmer,' Baquet said himself of Abramson in the article, adding that he thinks it 'a little bit of an unfair caricature'. 

Abramson refused to talk to Politico for the article.

Abramson joined the newspaper in 1997 after working for nearly a decade at The Wall Street Journal. She was the Times' Washington editor and bureau chief before being named managing editor in 2003.

Baquet succeeded her as managing editor after she was named to the top editing spot.

Unpopular: Staffers at the Times had described Abramson as 'stubborn, condescending, and difficult to work with' in a Politico article published last year.

Abramson was so dedicated to the Times
 that she even got the Paper's signature 'T' tattooed on her body. She 
told Out magazine that she has three other tattoos as well.

'I
 think eventually, when I finish doing them, [the tattoos] will tell the
 story of me, of where I lived, and what things have been important to 
me,' Abramson said.

Baquet 
originally joined the Times in 1990 as a reporter and held positions 
including deputy metropolitan editor and national editor. He left the 
paper for the Los Angeles Times in 2000, where he served as managing 
editor and then editor. Baquet rejoined the Times in 2007 and was 
Washington bureau chief before becoming the managing editor for news in 
September 2011.

Prior to his
 first stint at the Times, Baquet worked at The Chicago Tribune and The 
Times Picayune in New Orleans. While at the Tribune in 1988, he and two 
other journalists won the Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting, 
for looking into corruption in the Chicago City Council. He was a 
finalist in the same category in 1994.

The
 move comes amid a continued shift in the Times' focus, and that of the 
newspaper industry overall, toward digital products and away from 
traditional print papers as print circulation and advertising revenue 
declines.

In its most recent
 quarter, the Times Co. saw overall advertising revenue rise for the 
first time in three years, jumping 3 per cent to $158.7 million. The 
company's print and digital advertising rose compared with the same 
period a year ago.

The 
company also added digital subscribers and increased home-delivery 
prices. At the same time, the company posted a small profit that fell 
slightly short of Wall Street analysts' expectations.

New York Times Co. shares fell 71 cents, or 4.5 per cent, to end the afternoon at $15.06.
