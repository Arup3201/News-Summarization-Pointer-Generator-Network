The two young girls who stabbed one of their classmates and left her for dead are now facing 65 years in prison.

A judge has ruled that Anissa Weier, 13, and her friend Morgan Geyser, 12, of Waukesha, Wisconsin, will be tried as adults as they stand trial for their attack on Peyton Leutner, 12, who nearly died.

Both girls have been charged with attempted first-degree intentional homicide. 

Now, defense attorneys for the girls have scheduled hearings in hopes of moving their cases back to juvenile court.

This as recent interrogation video of Anissa, then 12, and Morgan 12, released last month showed the two calm and collected as they spoke with authorities.

Morgan describes seeing the fantasy character in her dreams, while Anissa claims she saw him in real life after they stabbed their classmate, Peyton 19 times before leaving her in the woods on May 31, 2014.

Peyton was saved when she was able to crawl out and get help from a passing bicyclist.

In a video, obtained by WISN, the girls both say they told Peyton they wanted to go bird watching, this after planning their attack on the school bus.

'People who trust you become very gullible,' Morgan told police. 

'And it was sort of sad.'

Anissa is more emotional during her interview, wiping away tears at one point.

'We told her we were going to get help,' she told police about the moments after the two stabbed Peyton. "

'But we weren't. We were going to run and let her pass away. So we ran.'

The girls were running off to find Slender Man, and were later picked up walking along a highway off-ramp, and Morgan had a knife in her backpack.

In the interrogation video, Morgan can also been seen with blood on her shirt, which she has photographed at one point.

She also begins singing to herself at one point during the six-hour interview, and told police of her plan; 'You have no idea how difficult it was not to tell anyone. I knew we'd get in trouble.'

When she described the actually stabbing, she said; 'It just sort of happened. It didn't feel like anything. It was like air.'

Anissa said at one point Slender Man would kill their families if they did not kill Peyton

Morgan and Anissa said they stabbed their friend to appease the Slender Man

As for Slender Man, Morgan described him as a man with 'tendrils that are very sharp.'

'I see him in my dreams,' she told police,

Anissa said in her interview that she did not have the same visions as Morgan, but knew she had to kill her friend for the Slender Man.

'I decided to go along, tag along, to prove the skeptics wrong,' she said.

Then, when asked if she saw the Slender Man, she told police; 'Uh huh, after Morgan stabbed [Peyton].'

She also revealed that Morgan said to her; 'I kinda sorta made a deal with Slender saying that if I didn't, if we didn't kill Peyton that he would, would either or could kill our families and everything we love.'
