An investigation has been launched after a seven-year-old girl found at the bottom of a swimming pool died while a bungling 911 dispatcher lost precious minutes because he could not find the correct number for an ambulance.

Kaitlynn Breann Garcia was pulled from Eucha State Park pool in Missouri while on a family day out on June 15 and was given CPR as a bystander frantically dialed emergency services.

However, the 911 dispatcher did not know where the pool was located and then wasted four minutes as he dialed a wrong number for emergency response.

Tragic blunders: Kaitlynn Garcia, 7, of Seneca, Missouri, drowned at a public pool. A 911 dispatcher lost valuable minutes in getting an ambulance to her as he had the wrong police phone number

The dispatcher asks directions to the swimming pool from the female caller, saying: 'Lake Eucha Pool? You know where that is?'

According to a recording of the tape on news9.com, the dispatcher then calls the wrong number.

He can be heard saying: 'Yes. Is this Jay? Yeah, I'm sorry. I've got the wrong number.'

The woman who made the 911 call becomes increasingly frantic, saying: 'Hurry. We donâ€™t know if she is breathing or not...'

The dispatcher continues: 'I, I, I'm trying to get a hold of an ambulance as best--trying to do the best, trying to do the best I can.'

It takes almost four minutes before the call is connected to the Jay Police Department - who are actually the ones who call an ambulance.

In total, it takes almost another 15 minutes for an ambulance to reach the scene from when the call is made.

Kaitlynn, from Seneca, was found in nine feet of water and died following the tragic incident.

The local sheriff has ordered an investigation into the 911 call that was made from the pool in Delaware County.

Sheriff Harlan Moore told grandlakenews.com: 'I am very upset. This is tragic.'

The dispatcher, who has worked the job for several years, only joined the Jay police department a month ago. The male employee, who has not been identified, has now resigned from his position.

The pool is operated by the city of Jay and can be rented for events with a lifeguard provided.

The funeral of Kaitlynn, whose parents are Mindy Hinman and Billy Garcia, will take place on Friday before she is buried at Petty Cemetery, Noel.
