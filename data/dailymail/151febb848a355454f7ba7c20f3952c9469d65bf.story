In a game lacking goals it proved to be an eventful 90 minutes for Daniel Sturridge - on and off the ball - in England's 0-0 draw with Honduras.

As the game was petering out in second half stoppage time, the Liverpool striker was struck by a beer can thrown from the crowd prompting the Liverpool striker to immediately turn his attention to the spectators.

Sturridge engaged in dialogue with those in attendance, with the area containing England and Honduras supporters.

It wasn't the first time the England hitman was targeted in the game, as he was also the victim of cynical play from Honduras' Emilio Izaguirre, who following a foul, directly kicked the ball into Sturridge's body while he lay on the ground following a trip.

The incident led to Sturridge verbally confronting the Celtic star, who was lucky to only be booked for the unsportsmanlike play.

By this point the game had already been stopped due to an electrical storm, but Sturridge was also guilty of missing three excellent chances to score.

Taking one for the team: Emilio Izaguirre kicks the ball straight at Sturridge's body following a stoppage in play

Below the belt: Sturridge was tripped for a foul seconds before Izaguirre stuck the ball in retaliation

Angry reaction: Sturridge squared up to Izaguirre following the incident

The first resulted in him firing wide with just the keeper to beat, seconds before play was brought to a halt in the 23rd minute.

The 24-year-old missed two decent opportunities in the second half too, the first an ambitious chip from inside the box drifting wide, while the second saw the former Chelsea forward header over unmarked from a Glen Johnson cross.

Given the beer cans and nasty tactics thrown at Sturridge, boss Roy Hodgson will be glad the striker he is likely to start against Italy in England's World Cup opener didn't manage to get himself sent off.

However he will hope that by the time the rumble in the jungle on June 14 comes round, Sturridge may have found his shooting boots.
