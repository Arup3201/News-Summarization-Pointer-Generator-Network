Dressed in supermarket-branded loungewear, unemployed Ronnie Moore would look out at his freshly-trimmed lawn with a washing-line full of cottons blowing above it and wonder if his future lay in the kitchen rather than the dugout.

Sacked by Tranmere Rovers last April having admitted an FA charge of breaching rules regarding betting on matches – a ‘joke’ he calls the whole affair - the Scouser was at rock bottom.

Meanwhile, 150 miles north of Liverpool in Hartlepool, the town’s football team had themselves plunged new depths. Bottom of League Two having lost seven of the previous eight, their proud status as residents of the Football League since 1920 was under threat.

In December, they turned to Moore, a month shy of his 62nd birthday. It was a long-shot for both parties.

‘People must have thought I was crackers coming in here,’ he says on the eve of a home match with Cambridge which could see Pools emerge from the relegation zone for the first time since October.

‘But I had been out of work for eight months. I knew how to wash up, hang washing out, what heat your cottons should be on. My back garden was like bloody Wembley. I was even going shopping and looking for the cheapest thing – the own brands.

‘Others might not have given me the chance considering all the crap that was written.

‘I was not going behind people's backs betting thousands of pounds on things. It was nothing but a family syndicate. The whole thing was a joke.

‘So just to be given the opportunity when no-one wants you, just to get back in, that drives you on.’ Within a few weeks, however, Hartlepool had fallen 10 points adrift of safety. They had still not won under Moore’s care. He had been horrified when it took 15 minutes during his first training session for the team to string five passes together and commented, ‘We’ve got some f****** bad players.'

He had some harsh words for them in public, too.

‘I have sent out a circular to say we have players available but I don’t expect my phone to be red hot to be honest,’ he said in January.

‘Where do they think they are going to go at the end of the season? They are not going to Real Madrid.

‘One of them might go to League One, but one or two of them might be working in Asda.

‘These lads don’t have a clue what life is about. They go home at 1pm, get their feet up and watch Home & Away. All we can try to do is wise them up.’ Wise up and shape up they have. Indeed, three wins in a week without conceding has moved them to within one point of safety. ‘From where we were, to keep us up would have to be the best thing I have ever done as a manager,’ says Moore.

‘It would be better than my two promotions at Rotherham. Everyone thought we were dead and buried.’ There have been dressing-room dressing-downs for several players, including former Newcastle and West Ham striker Marlon Harewood.

He even accused some of having ‘a heart the size of a peanut’ and told them there would be no days off until they won – he had to renege on that threat after four games.

Neil Austin has seen seven managers during six years at Victoria Park. The 31-year-old defender admits Moore was exactly what was needed.

‘As soon as he walked through the door he got respect straight away,’ he says.

‘He knows how to treat players. People might have thought some of his comments were harsh, but given the league position you couldn’t argue.

‘We had a harder job trying to work out who the League One player was - because everyone else was heading for Asda!’ Hartlepool are expecting their biggest crowd of the season on Saturday after cutting ticket prices to as low as £10.

Hartlepool have taken Preston striker Jordan Hugill for the rest of the season on loan 

Austin adds: ‘Survival is massive for the town. The club is part of the town and its identity.

‘This is a proper Football League club with a proper, old-school ground. Too many grounds now feel a bit fake, a bit like a Subbuteo set.

‘Here, you can smell the Bovril coming from the terraces when you’re playing and we want it bouncing again tomorrow. We’re all in it together now and we will stay up, I’m sure of it.’ Should Austin prove right, Moore will no longer feel the need to air their dirty linen in public.
