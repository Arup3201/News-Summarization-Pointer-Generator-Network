Electric shock: Hummer's revolutionary new electric car has gone on sale in the UK on fullycharged.com

And far from being a pollution menace, the vehicle qualifies for free parking, no road tax and is exempt from the London congestion charge, all because it is so green.

Ben Jaconelli, of fullycharged.com which is selling the cars in the UK, said: 'They are really cool versions of the Hummer. They look almost identical but are environmentally friendly and ideal for driving round a city.'

Unlike it's US military counterpart which can get up to 70 mph, the electric Humvee has a top speed of 35 miles per hour.

It also comes equipped with a special dual golf bag holder, carbon fibre dashboard and Pioneer sound system.

Going green: The Hummer has a range of 40 miles, which can be doubled to 80 miles if upgraded to a Lithium battery

It has a range of 40 miles, which can be doubled to 80 miles if upgraded to a Lithium battery.

But unlike its bigger relative, the e-Humvee only seats two people.

However it does come with the Hummer grille, and custom wheels, seats and floor mats and leather interiors.

The vehicles are on show at fullycharged's pop up show in Globe House, Bermondsey Street, London.

Hummer's trucks, 4X4 vehicles and luxury SUVs 'combine off-road capabilities and interior comfort, creating the ultimate in rugged sophistication'

Until its demise in 2009 the Hummer vehicle by General Motors was an iconic gas guzzler in the United States

Following the purchase of the rights to the design by UK manufacturing and design firm Prindiville, it has now been reinvented as a two-seater electric vehicle
