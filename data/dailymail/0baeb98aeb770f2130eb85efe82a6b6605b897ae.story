A cat stuck on a 90ft ledge sparked a three day rescue attempt by the RSPCA and firefighters who had to use a cherry picker to grab the stranded moggy.

The feline was spotted on the viaduct above Stockport, Manchester, on Wednesday afternoon.

After a three-day rescue attempt, which saw the RSPCA and firefighters worked aloft a cherry picker for several hours to try to coax the cat to safety, it was finally brought down today.

Perilous: The grey and white cat was spotted on the viaduct ledge 90ft above Stockport by an eagle-eyed worker sparking a three-day rescue attempt by RSPCA and firefighters who used a cherry picker to get him

Kishore Kapoor, 55, who works at a cabinet making firm under the viaduct, alerted the RSPCA and Greater Manchester Fire Service, who were sent to the scene on Thursday morning.

Speaking earlier this week, he said: 'There is no way it can get down, if it jumps it will be splattered.'

On Thursday night, with the light fading, crews retired for the night but placed a humane trap on the ledge, in the hope it would capture the animal.

By that time, the grey and white cat, wearing a light blue collar, had spent at least 24 hours on the viaduct above Chestergate.

A spokesman for the RSPCA, speaking on Thursday night, said: 'Officers from RSPCA and Greater Manchester Fire Service have spent the day doing all they can to try to rescue a cat stuck on a ledge on a viaduct on Chestergate Street, Stockport.

'The ledge is 90ft off the ground and 5ft from the top of the viaduct.

'An
 RSPCA officer went up on a hydraulic platform on Thursday but the cat 
wouldn't come to him so we secured a cat trap on the ledge which we 
hope the cat will get into so that we can get it down.'Â 

How did you get up there? The cat's tiny figure can be seen in the middle of the viaduct 90ft from the ground and five foot from the top of the viaduct. RSPCA and firefighters used a hydraulic lift to get up to the cat

When RSPCA officers went back to the site this morning, they discovered the curious feline had taken the bait and was safely inside their cat trap.

One RSPCA officer went up on the hydraulic platform to lift the tired and hungry cat down at about 12.15pm.

A spokeswoman for the RSPCA said: 'It was a very precarious position the cat managed to get itself into.'

The organisation is now looking after the cat at its centre in Salford and is appealing for the owner to come forward.

'We were hoping the cat was microchipped but it isn't so we don't know a name or who the owner is at the moment.

'It is certainly someone's pet because the cat is in good condition. It has been fed and watered and is at RSPCA Greater Manchester'

Huge: The viaduct is a landmark in Stockport but posed a challenge for RSPCA officers and firefighters who had to try to reach the cat safely. They stopped as darkeness fell on Thursday but returned today to catch it
