Nicklas Bendtner has finally found himself a new club after agreeing a move to Wolfsburg. 

The former Arsenal striker was released by the Gunners at the end of last season following several unfulfilled campaigns at the Emirates. 

Hull City and Crystal Palace both registered interest in Bendtner, but the Dane has opted for a move to Germany.

Done: Nicklas Bendtner has finally found himself a new club after agreeing a move to Wolfsburg

The 26-year-old has signed a three-year deal at the Volkswagen Arena and will immediately link up with Dieter Hecking's squad ahead of the new Bundesliga season.

He also had an offer from Olympiacos but wasn't keen on a move to Greece where the competition is less fierce. 

Bendtner played 14 times for Arsene Wenger's side last season - such were their injury problems - but only managed to find the net twice.  

Working hard: Bendtner has been training with his friends in a bid to keep up his fitness this summer
