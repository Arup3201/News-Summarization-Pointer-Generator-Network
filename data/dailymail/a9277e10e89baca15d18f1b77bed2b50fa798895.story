Arsene Wenger admitted before the Champions League draw that he was dreaming of a tie against former club Monaco, it's a dream he'll be living come February. 

The Arsenal manager spent seven years at Monaco between 1987 and 1994, winning both the Ligue 1 title and the Coupe de France.

Just as he would in both Japan and north London, Wenger re-shaped Monaco upon arrival. He persuaded Glenn Hoddle to join on a free transfer from Tottenham while defender Patrick Battiston also moved to the principality after his Bordeaux contract expired. Forward Mark Hateley joined too after a successful three years in Italy with AC Milan.

1987-88: Wins Ligue 1 in his first season

1988-89: Finishes third in the league, loses in Coupe de France final to Marseille 

1989-90: Finishes third in the league

1990-91: Wins Coupe de France

1991-92: Finishes second in the league, loses in Cup Winners Cup final 

1992-93: Finishes second in the league

1993-94: Finishes ninth in the league

1994-95: Sacked in September with Monaco 17th in the table 

Wenger's success was instantaneous, he won the league in his first season and managed to sign a young George Weah the following summer. 

But the second season was one of frustration for Wenger after he lost in the final of the Coupe de France to bitter rivals Marseille and finished third in the league behind Marseille and Paris Saint-Germain. 

Wenger tasted success again in 1991 when his side got revenge on Marseille by beating them in the final of the Coupe de France.

But the years that followed saw a steady decline both in terms of trophies won and also final league positions. 

He did, however, reach the final of the European Cup Winners Cup in 1992 and helped to develop a number of talented players at the club, including Arsenal's future record goal scorer Thierry Henry.

In his penultimate season at the club Bayern Munich made an approach for Wenger. 

Monaco refused to let him join the Bundesliga giants but then sacked him early in the 1994-95 season after a string of poor results that left them 17th in the table.

The Frenchman could have stayed in his native country but problems with domestic match-fixing and bribery, which Marseille were found guilty of in 1994, had tainted his view of the league and he instead opted for a move to Japan.

Wenger is lifted onto the shoulders of a Monaco player by Weah and Dib in Paris after his domestic cup success - it was the last trophy that Wenger won while in charge of the club, although he came close to winning others in the seasons that followed

Wenger talks to Ajax, Barcelona and Holland legend Johan Cruyff; the two men shared a philosophy of attacking football in their managerial careers - at Monaco this was represented by players such as Glenn Hoddle, Jurgen Klinsmann and George Weah

Wenger smoking on the bench while in charge at Monaco; he said of the habit: 'I never smoked a lot and never when I played but when I became a young coach I had an assistant who smoked and, at 3am in the morning when you have lost a big game, I might have one'

Wenger hugs coach Petit in 1994 it what what turned out to be his final year at the club, and his final year in Ligue 1 - he headed to Japan to join Nagoya Grampus Eight for the 1995-96 season before being brought to London to take charge of Arsenal

Wenger and Roger Lemerre in August 1994, just one month before he was sacked as manager of Monaco - Lemerre was, at the time, manager of the French army team but had previously had spells in charge of Red Star, Lens, Strasbourg and Paris

Wenger and Petit in the dugout in 1990 - Petit had three separate spells as assistant manager at Monaco that were punctuated by two brief periods as caretaker manager, including after Wenger was sacked by the Ligue 1 club in 1994

Wenger's time at the club may have ended on a sour note with the his arguments over corruption in the league and his eventual sacking by the club, but Monaco fans will look back fondly on his tenure after he brought them a league title, the French cup and two European finals

Between his appointment on July 1 1987 and his sacking in on September 17 1994, Wenger took charge of 266 games at Monaco - he won 130, drew 53 and lost 83, giving him a win ratio of 48.87 per cent during his time there, which was 20 per cent better than his time at Nancy
