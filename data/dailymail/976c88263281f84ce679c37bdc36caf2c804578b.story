The wait is over. On Thursday, it was officially announced at Buckinghamshire's Pinewood Studios that Daniel Craig would be reprising his role as super-spy 007 in Spectre, the latest film in the saga, which will be directed by Sam Mendes.

As well as the veteran bond hero, the latest installment of the action film franchise will see other cast members making a return to the film, including Ralph Fiennes as M, Naomie Harris as Miss Moneypenny, Ben Whishaw as Q and Rory Kinnear as Bill Tanner.

However, a new film means a new Bond Girl and this one is perhaps the most illusive we are yet to see.

French actress Lea Seydoux will be taking on the role of femme fatale, she'll play the part of Madeline Swann alongside Monica Belluci who at 50, is the oldest Bond girl to ever grace our screens.

Femme fatale: Lea Seydoux was announced as the latest Bond girl in October this year playing the part of Madeline Swann

At 29, some might imagine that Lea lacks the experience of her co-star Monica however the French actress is in no need of practice when it comes to playing the role of an on-screen siren.

Lea is perhaps best known for her part in the sexually explicit lesbian drama, Blue is the Warmest Colour. 

The role saw the actress take part in a seven-minute long sex scene with co-star Adele Exarchopoulos that left very little to the imagination. So when it comes to the sexpectations of a Bond girl,  Lea is unlikely to be camera shy.

In fact, some of her required scenes in the Bond film will seem like light relief for Lea - she and Adele openly criticised the director behind the cult gay film, Abdellatif Kechiche, for his over-demanding sex scenes.

Both girls said that despite the film's success - it won top prize at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival - they will never work with Abdellatif Kechiche again, with the Adele adding that most directors would have 'more respect' than to ask what he asked of them. 

Despite her convincing performance in the film, Lea disappointed many of her legions of fans when she revealed that she was actually in a serious relationship with a man.

Although she did admit that months of preparing for the part had left her questioning her sexuality at times. 

She told the Evening Standard earlier this year: 'Of course I did. Me as a person, as a human being…’ 

‘It’s not nothing, making those scenes. Of course I question myself. But…I did not have any revelations.’

Lea guards her love life furiously though and has so far refused to mention her boyfriend's name in any interviews.

Controversial: Although her most famous role, Lea revealed that she would never work with the director of the film again because of his demanding attitudes towards the infamous sex scenes

Award winning: Despite the conflict that came with Blue is the Warmest Colour, the film won top prize at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival

While Lea doesn't have the same fame status as some of the previous bond girl alumni, she has been rubbing shoulders with the stars in Hollywood blockbusters for years.

In 2009, she made an appearance as Charlotte LaPadite in Quentin Tarantino's Inglorious Basterds and in 201, she offered Owen Wilson a shoulder to cry on in Woody Allen's 'Midnight in Paris' as Gabrielle, the French girl who shares his love of the songwriter Cole Porter.

She has also earned her stripes in the fighting department - it is common knowledge that every Bond girl can kick as well as they can kiss and Lea's triumphs in the film industry have already seen her get in a fair bit of practice.

She first tried her hand at spy films when she starred in 2011's 'Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol' as a knife-carrying assassin, sure to come in handy in the 007 flick which is due to be released in November 2015.

She gets about! Lea also made a cameo appearance in Wes Anderson's Grand Budapest Hotel where she played a maid (in background)

And this role of Madeline Swann should come as quite a triumph for Lea who has been pining after a strong female lead since auditioning for the role of Lisbeth Salander in The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo.

She has previously spoken of her disappointment at learning the part had been given to actress Rooney Mara. 

In an interview with Esquire magazine, she said: 'I got upset, but I don't think I'd be able to do anything to get that part. 

It was totally against my nature. I worked hard, but Lisbeth was almost anorexic. I wasn't like that.'

And the 29-year-old has remained true to her ethics on whether women should change themselves too much for a role.  

Speaking about the weight of expectation for a Bond girl, she insisted: 'You have to get rid of the pressure, you just have to invent something new.' 

Fashionable friends: Lea's father is best friends with Christian Louboutin who designed Lea her first pair of designer shoes at the age of 12

So stylish: Lea has been noted for her good taste in clothing and has landed several fashion campaigns

One aspect of the Bond girl image that Lea unquestionably fits the bill for, is her penchant for style. 

The Parisian actress has been turning heads on the red carpet with her bold style choices for the last few years, something that has been influenced by her childhood.

Ahead of the release of Blue is the Warmest Colour last summer, Lea revealed told the Evening Standard that her childhood had involved one very stylish perk.

In the interview she revealed that her summers as a child were spent with her father's best friend, Christian Louboutin.

Sje said: 'He used to come to our holiday house in Brittany, on an island called Bréhat, and draw shoes, shoes, shoes.' 

His influence saw Lea acquiring expensive taste from a young age when the shoe designer, famous for his red soles, made her sister her first Louboutins when she was 14 and Lea received her first pair at the age of 12.

As well as fashionable friends, Lea has grown up surrounded by a family who were blessed with success and style which are no doubt an influence on the young actress' good eye for clothing.  

Her mother, Valérie Schlumberger, is an actress turned philanthropist and her father is a businessman who runs the French wireless company Parrot. 

But the family have a long history in film and television - her grandfather Jerome Seydoux is the chairman of the film company Pathé and her granduncle Nicholas is the chairman of Gaumont Film Company.  

Meanwhile, her older sister Camille is now a stylist who dresses Lea and Bérénice Bejo, star of The Artist. 

Lea has also dabbled in fashion herself, appearing in a campaign for clothing brand Rag and Bone along side American actor Michael Pitt for their AW13 collection.

She also appeared in Miu Miu's 2014 resort campaign with Blue is the Warmest Colour co-star Adele Exarchopoulos and is currently the face of Prada's fragrance, Candy.

Lea continued her stylish successes yesterday as she arrived at the announcement of the film's much anticipated title in a fitted black Miu Miu dress, with matching belt and shoes.

Filming for the new flick begins on Monday and so far Lea has given little away as to what we can expect from her character. 

She said: 'I've read the script but it only becomes real when you start. For now it's kind of abstract.'

Meanwhile, leading man Daniel was slightly more telling, describing the script for Spectre as 'better than we had last time'.

Optimistic: Daniel Craig (centre) said of the latest Bond film 'We've got an amazing cast and, I think, a better script than we had last time'

The 46-year-old actor expects the movie to be superior to the 2012 hit Skyfall, which made more than $1.1 billion (£701million) at the worldwide box office.

Although the actor did not speak specifically about Lea, the 46-year-old said that he though his co-stars were 'amazing.'

'We've got an amazing cast and, I think, a better script than we had last time.'

The title of the new Sam Mendes-directed film relates to the Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion (SPECTRE), which is led by iconic evil genius Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the scarred super-villain whose organisation played a prominent part in the Dr. No and Thunderball movies. 

Plot details of the new movie - which sees Ralph Fiennes replace Dame Judi Dench as M, the head of the MI6 intelligence service - read: 'A cryptic message from Bond's past sends him on a trail to uncover a sinister organisation.

'While M battles political forces to keep the secret service alive, Bond peels back the layers of deceit to reveal the terrible truth behind Spectre. 

We may not know her name yet but if the phenomenal success of Skyfall, the last James Bond picture, is anything to go by, Seydoux will soon be a global star.
