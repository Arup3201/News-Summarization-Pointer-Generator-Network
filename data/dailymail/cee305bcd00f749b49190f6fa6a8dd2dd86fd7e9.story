Safe: Alexandra Spirinka had been missing for two days when Game of Thrones fan Cairo Nurmagambetov, 47, found her. She vanished while playing outside her home in the Russian city of Omsk

The flock of birds led him to Alexandra Spirkina, who went missing two days earlier.

Despite the fact that 400 police officers, including 15 dog handlers, and 200 volunteers participated in the hunt none of them got close to finding her.

A police officer said: 'We had state of the art thermal imaging equipment but it was the crows that won the day. 

'The person that found her said that 
in the show Game Of Thrones there was always something significant 
happening when the crows gathered. Thank goodness he decided to check it
 out.'

The girl had vanished
 on May Day after playing outside her home in the early evening.

Her 
father, Emelyan, 35, was outside tinkering with his car and called the 
police when he could not see her.

Cairo
 Nurmagambetov, 47, said: 'I knew that the crows meant there was 
something happening. I drove towards them and when I got there I saw the
 girl who was walking across the field.

'She was crying and calling for 
her dad.

Curiosity: The fan of the show went to investigate after seeing a group of crows circling above a field

Care: After she was safely located, the toddler was bundled into a car and taken for treatment

Investigation: The youngster, who is out of sight being cradled by her mother, is said to be in a stable condition and has not yet been interviewed about her disappearance

'I gave her some crisps and a drink, and put my jacket round her to warm her up before taking her back to the other rescuers.'

She is in a stable condition but has not yet been interviewed about her disappearance.

Curiosity: Police thanked the 47-year-old (pictured in the car) for investigating the circling birds, as a huge search party struggled to find the missing girl

In the first series, it presents itself as Bran is about to fire an arrow and causes him to stop.

The raven then lands on the head of a direwolf statue and cries once, before flying towards the Stark family crypt.

The young character then tries to kill the raven with a bow and arrow during the third series.
