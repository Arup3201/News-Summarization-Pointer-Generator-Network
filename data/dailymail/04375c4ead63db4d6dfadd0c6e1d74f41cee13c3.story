Three nine-year-old girls allegedly plotted to kill their teacher with hand-sanitizer because they thought she was mean and they knew she was highly allergic to the antibacterial substance.

The group of 4th-graders from Elba Central School near the city of Batavia in New York are believed to have spoken to classmates about their plans just before they went on winter break.

However their plan was foiled when a concerned school board member called the police. 

They were told earlier in the year they were not allowed to bring sanitizer into the classroom because of their teacher's severe allergies, suggesting they knew it would cause her health significant health problems. 

Plot: The group of 4th-graders from Elba Central School in upstate New York are believed to have spoken to classmates about their plans to kill their teacher with hand-sanitizer just before they went on winter break

So they discussed spreading the liquid on items the teacher frequently touched - which is when someone overheard them and told their parents. 

Joyce Veraccini, whose son was in the same class as the girls, told WHAM: 'He told me that a bunch of girls in this class was threatening with hand sanitizer on the teacher and it's just shocking.'

Those suspected of the potentially deadly plan were then interviewed by Genessee County Sheriff's Office who reportedly concluded that the motive behind the plot was that the group thought their teacher was 'mean'.

According to WGRZ, one of the students stated that her teacher 'yells at us and that the class has problems with her.' 

Another tried to imply that the plan to poison the teacher, who has not been named, started with another pupil.

The Genessee Sheriff's Department, who filed an incident report on the matter, suggested that there was bullying in the class and certain members had struggled to work together.

After the pupils allegedly contradicted themselves during the interviews, the school decided to take over the matter from law enforcement and deal with it themselves.

However it is not known whether the children have been punished.

Deputy Sheriff Jerome Brewster said: 'It's not a crime to think about hurting someone. It only becomes a crime when you take action on that thought.' 

He added that their case could not go to family court unless it was a misdemeanor or felony.  

Elba Superintendent Jerome Piwko responded to the incident in a statement released on Thursday.

He said: 'It has been widely reported that certain fourth grade students had been discussing a way to harm a teacher in the Elba Central School District. This event has been a shock to our community and school. 

'The District cannot comment on the specifics of this event, including disicipline, as the information is protected from disclosure under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. The reports in the media and on social media do not accurately reflect the entire event.'

'He added: As soon as the District was made aware of the students' discussion it called in students that were thought to have knowledge of the discussions. After the students were interviewed, the District contacted the Sheriff's Department and cooperated with the Sheriff's Deputies in their investigation of the matter. 

'The Sheriff's Department concluded that no crime had been committed and the matter was turned back over to the District. The District in turn has worked with the parents and students involved to address this issue. 

'It is important to note that no one was injured or actually placed in harm's way.

'The District does not condone any of the behaviors that have been reported and is in the process of working alongside the Sheriff's Department to use this incident as a vehicle for educating the District's students regarding appropriate behaviors.'
