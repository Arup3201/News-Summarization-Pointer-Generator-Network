Minneapolis police have charged two parents in the suffocation death of their 6-week-old daughter found dead inside a laundry basket back in March.

Cardie Jackson, 39, and her 40-year-old husband, Shonwta Jackson, were charged with second-degree murder Monday.

Police say the baby suffocated in a laundry basket filled with a pillow and blankets where the newborn regularly slept.

Preventable tragedy: Cardie and Shonwta Jackson's six-week-old baby girl was found dead inside a laundry basket pied with bedding, where she regularly slept  

According to investigators, a nurse had given the couple information warning against including pillows or loose bedding in a baby’s sleep environment.

The deceased little girl was the Jacksons’ 11th child. They had lost custody of nine children and a 2-year-old is in foster care.

The state had required Cardie Jackson to show she could care for the 2-year-old when the child was born.

The couple have a warrant out for their arrest, but as of Monday night they had not been taken into police custody.

According to the criminal complaint obtained by The Minneapolis Star Tribune, Cardie Jackson called 911 on March 2 to report that her baby was not breathing.

The mother of 11 children, ranging in age between six weeks and 16 years, told police that her husband woke up to use the restroom and found their youngest daughter unresponsive in a laundry basket next to their bed.

Cardie Jackson admitted that the night before, she had been drinking and smoking marijuana during a house party.

Mrs Jackson woke up at 3am to give her newborn formula, but she said the child was not very hungry, so she placed her back in her makeshift bed inside the laundry basket filled with adult-size bedding.

A visiting nurse, who had been assigned to the family because the little girl was born four weeks premature, had provided the family with literature that described how they must use a firm mattress in a crib covered with a fitted sheet and emptied of stuffed toys, loose bedding and pillows.

According to officials, the Jacksons had 11 children between 1992 and 2014, but by 2004 they had given up their parental rights to six of the kids.
