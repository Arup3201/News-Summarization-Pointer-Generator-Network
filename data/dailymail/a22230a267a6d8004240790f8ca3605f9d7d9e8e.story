Documents obtained under a federal Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by Judicial Watch detail costs incurred during the First Lady's trip to South Africa and Botswana in June - with the cost of firing up 'Air Force 2' alone amounting to $424,142.

The White House earlier professed the purpose of the trip was to help 'youth
leadership, education, health and wellness' in south Africa.

'Air Force 2': Michelle Obama waves as she boards her private plane after a week-long trip to Africa in June. Costs of the flight are estimated to tally more than $424,000

Greetings: Mrs Obama was met by excited children when she arrived to Botswana on June 24

Warm welcome: Mrs Obama with daughters Sasha, far right, and Malia, right, were greeted by traditional dancers as they arrive in Gaborone, Botswana

Judicial Watch said it based the jet 
costs on the U.S. Department of Defense's published hourly rates for the C-32A aircraft - a 
specifically configured military version of the Boeing 757.

During the June 21-27 trip, the group accounted for 34.8 flight hours at $12,188 per hour.

That does not include a tally of local
transportation, Secret Service protection, food for the 21 family and 
staff members - and the cost of pre-trip preparations contributing to 
the final amount. Those figures have yet to be disclosed.

According to the release, the 
passenger manifests confirm the presence of Obama's daughter's, Malia 
and Sasha on the trip. The two girls are listed as 'Senior Staff.'

Family safari: Mrs Obama, joined by her daughters Sasha and Malia and her mother Marian Robinson enjoyed a ride through Madikwe Game Reserve during the trip

Encouraging: Mrs Obama stands with Mamphela Ramphele, fifth from right, and high school students after she answered students' questions at the University of Cape Town in Cape Town, South Africa on June 23

Playful: Mrs obama (R) and daughters Sasha (C) and Malia take turns read to students during a visit to the Emthonjeni Community Center in Zandspruit Township, Johannesburg, South Africa on June 21

Goals: Mrs Obama said the trip would help 'youth
leadership, education, health and wellness' in southern Africa, 
according to the White House

The manifests also list Mrs Obama's 
mother, Marian Robinson, and niece and nephew, Leslie and Avery 
Robinson, as well Mrs. Obama's make-up and hairstylist (Carl Ray and 
Johnny Wright).

The expense records also show $928.44 
was spent for 'bulk food' purchases on flight. Overall, during the trip,
192 meals were served for the 21 passengers on board.

The 'professed purpose' of the trip 'was 
to encourage young people living in the two growing democracies to 
become involved in national affairs; and during her scheduled stops in 
Pretoria and Cape Town, South Africa and in Gaborone, the capital of 
Botswana, the First Lady used the opportunity to speak on education, 
health and wellness issues,' the report states.

Memorable: Mrs Obama also took her daughters to visit Nelson Mandela, a visit which she called 'surreal'

Family: From left, Mrs Obama's niece Leslie Robinson, Malia Obama, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Mrs Obama, Sasha Obama and nephew Avery Robinsona at Cape Town Stadium in South Africa on June 23

Mission expense records and passenger manifests from the United States Air Force related to the June 21-27, 2011 trip taken by First Lady Michelle Obama, her family and her staff to South Africa and Botswana, according to watchdog group Judicial Watch include:

The Obamas also enjoyed a 
meet up with Nelson Mandela. However, the trip also included visits to historical landmarks, and ended with a private family safari at a South African game reserve 
before the group returned to Washington on June 27.

Judicial Watch, which investigates and
fights government corruption, said in a press release issued today it 
is investigating the purpose and itinerary of the trip.

On June 28, 2011, the group filed a 
Freedom of Information Act request seeking the mission taskings, 
transportation records, and passenger manifests for Michelle Obama's 
Africa trip. Documents were only provided after Judicial Watch sued to 
obtain the documents, according to the release.

'This trip was as much an opportunity for the Obama family to go on a safari as it was a trip to conduct government business,' said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. 'This junket wasted tax dollars and the resources of our overextended military. No wonder we had to sue to pry loose this information.'
