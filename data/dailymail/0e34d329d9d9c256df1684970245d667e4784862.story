With his fist in the air, red cape flapping behind him and an ear-to-ear grin, little Luke seems like the luckiest three-year-old alive.

Rigged up on ropes swishing through the air, Luke is fulfilling his fantasy to fly like Superman.

Sadly though, the little superhero is anything but lucky. Born with a terminal heart condition, Luke does not have long to live.

Unaware that his condition is terminal, the reaction of 'Super Luke' as he glides through the air is heartwarming -- and so far the You Tube clip has attracted nearly 30,000 hits.

All smiles: Terminally ill Luke Campbell flies through the air like Superman

The three-year-old, who lives in Heswall, Wirral, with his parents, Sarah and Graham, and two sisters, Olivia, 7, and baby Hope, was born with the congenital heart condition Tetralogy of Fallot. Sadly his heart has now gone into failure and doctors aren't confident he has long to live.

Luke had his first surgery at just six 
weeks old and has very limited blood flow to his heart. Although he 
is on medication, there is nothing else the doctors can do to help.

'Every day Luke wakes up we are 
grateful,' says Sarah, who arranged the day through Make A Wish
 Foundation (www.make-a-wish.org.uk), a charity which helps fulfill the 
dreams of terminally ill children.

'The wish was a fantastic day and has also really helped his 
sister Olivia. She knows he is very sick but we still have him for a bit
 longer and he still has life and fun left in him.'

'We had a brilliant 
time and have created some very special memories to remember when he is 
no longer with us,' she says.

Due to his heart problems Luke's left lung is no longer functioning. 'Once he loses the right lung, we’ll have to say goodbye,' Sarah says. 'But he’s got no idea at all.'

'Luke isn't going to be around forever so the feeling of him actually being Superman is fantastic.'

The little trooper has always been called mummy's 
little superhero, or 'Super Luke'.

Luke travelled with his family to Liverpool in a limousine. When he was harnessed up he was told all he had to do was put his hand in the air and he would fly, which he did - again, again and again!

His sister Olivia even enjoyed taking flight with him too. To make it even more special, the room was decorated with a New York theme and Luke received several Superman-themed presents.

'The wish allowed Luke to be a child for the day, away from hospitals and doctors. There was no one there worrying about him - he could do whatever he wanted. It was fantastic to see him so happy and enjoying himself,' adds Sarah.
