The ugly family feud surrounding radio legend Casey Kasem who died last Sunday was put on a temporary hold as his daughter Kerri agreed that widow Jean could claim his body.

But behind the scenes, the battle wages on with Kerri's team accusing her stepmom, Jean, of cheating on her father with a much younger man as he lay on his deathbed.

'Jean has a boyfriend and Kerri believes their affair has been going on for at least two years,' Kerri’s private investigator, Logan Clarke, told the MailOnline in an exclusive interview. 

'Jean has even moved him into the oceanfront condo she owns in Malibu.'

Battle of wills: Casey Kasem's widow Jean and his daughter Kerri have been engaged in a tug of war over Casey - his care and his money - for years. Kerry's PI is claiming that Jean was having an affair behind his back

Top 40 king: Radio personality Casey Kasem died on Father's Day, finally succumbing to Lewy body disease, the most common type of progressive dementia after Alzheimer's

A neighbor at the luxury, 10-unit building overlooking the Pacific confirmed that a man named John Paul (JP) Gressy is now living in the 450 square-foot condo that the Kasems have owned for many years.

A maid who answered the door to the Kasems' condo also confirmed that Gressy lives there.

It's not clear if Gressy is the man Kerri Kasem has accused of being involved with Jean.

Neither Jean Kasem's representative nor Paul Gressy returned calls to MailOnline.

Clarke described the alleged boyfriiend as tall, handsome, dark-haired man about 40 years junior to Casey, who was 82 when he died after battling  Lewy body disease, the most common type of progressive dementia after Alzheimer's.

One of Kerri’s Los Angeles lawyers, Troy L. Martin, also made reference to Jean’s alleged extra-marital activities, writing in court papers dated March 19 this year: 'Mrs. Kasem has been lying to Mr. Kasem for at least two years, telling him that they are divorced.  What possible motive could Mrs. Kasem have for such cruelty. 

'Perhaps the younger gentleman that is staying at the Malibu house and driving Mr. Kasem’s car could answer that question for us.'

Love nest? Kerri Kasem's lawyer claims that Jean lied to Casey by telling him they were divorced. Why would she be so cruel, the lawyer asked in court papers. 'Perhaps the younger gentleman that is staying at the Malibu house...could answer that question for us,' he wrote

The cheating accusation is the latest in a seven-year battle between Jean Kasem, 60, Casey’s second wife, and Kerri and Julie Kasem - his daughters from his first marriage - over how to manage his deteriorating health.  The daughters claimed Jean was treating their father cruelly and tried to prevent them from seeing him during the last month before his death from sepsis and dementia.  Jean’s reps countered that the older children were trying to lay claim to Casey’s estimated $80 million estate.

On June 13, just two days before her father died, Kerri Kasem, 41, raged at her stepmother, Jean, telling the Hollywood Reporter: 'I want this evil woman in jail for what she has done to this family.'

And Kerri’s PI, Clarke told the MailOnline:  'I have been hired to gather the facts to prove that Jean Kasem committed a crime. Casey would be alive today - he probably would have lived for another year or more - if it had not been for Jean’s cruelty and abuse. '

Clarke said that the information he is collecting   will be used by Kerri and Julie in 'possible legal actions - both criminal and civil' - against Jean.  'Wrongful death, elder abuse, defamation of character, any or all of these cases could be brought to court,' he added.  'Jean has caused and incredible amount of pain and damage to the Kasem family.'

The 'crime' that Clarke says he’s trying to persuade Santa Monica police to investigate is Jean’s decision in early May to take Casey from a Santa Monica hospital to a house in Washington state, without informing other family members.

Vows: Kasem married Jean, a statuesque actress in 1980, a year after his divorce from first wife. They went on to have a daughter together, Liberty, now 23, who firmly sides with her mother

'The doctor at the hospital in Santa Monica told Jean that it could kill him if she removed his feeding tube,' added Carke.  'But she did it anyway.  She put Casey in an SUV with a Mexican caretaker , no doctor or nurse.  Then she got in another SUV with Liberty (Jean’s 24 year-old daughter with Casey) and took off out of California, first to Nevada, then to Washington.  

'This whole trip was deliberately to prevent Kerri and Julie from seeing their father - and seeing what a sorry state he was in.  Jean didn’t even get a proper hospital bed for him.  That’s why he ended up with bedsores.

'Kerri and Julie were concerned about their father and wanted to see him because they knew about Jean’s terrible record of caring for him - they knew their dad was being horribly neglected.'

But Jean said in a June 9 court declaration:  'I have spared no expense to ensure that Casey receives state-of-the-art medical treatment and 24-hour-a-day care.'

But, said Clarke:  'The reality is nothing close to that.  She would abandon him for 9,10, 11 days at a time.  I have notes from doctors saying, "Mr. Kasem’s wife says she’s coming to visit him but she never shows up."

'One hospital he was in discharged him and Jean didn’t come to pick him up for seven days.  He had to stay in the hospital for that extra week till she showed up.'

The family feud over Casey’s health began in 2007 when he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease.  He signed a document giving his older children by his first marriage the authority to make decisions concerning his medical care if he was no longer able to himself.  The document declared that he did not want to be kept alive if he had 'no reasonable hope of normal functioning.'

Happier times: Court papers reveal how Kasem's three children from his previous marriage, Kerri, Michael and Julie were on good terms with Jean until his health deteriorated. But for seven years they have been fighting over who cares for him with Jean claiming they showed 'disturbing' behavior and want to secure his $80m

This snub to Jean came back to haunt the Kasem family six years later with nasty court battles and accusations from Casey’s older kids that as his health went steadily downhill, Jean was shutting them out of his life.

On June 11, a Los Angeles judge, upheld Casey Kasem’s 2007 wishes, giving Kerri the authority to have doctors end his infusions of water, food and medicine after hearing from doctors that continuing nutrition would 'at best prolong the dying process for him and will certainly add suffering to an already uncomfortable dying process.'

The court’s decision was condemned by Jean’s Los Angeles attorney,  Steve Haney, who called it 'the functional equivalent of a death sentence.'

Haney claimed that Kerri’s real concern over her father is that she wants to profit from her father’s death.  'Kerri was cut off in 2007 after she accumulated hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans,' he said in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter the week before Casey’s death.  “Casey and Jean’s fear is that any money going to the Scientologist  kids would end up in the Church.  Instead he gave Kerri and her two siblings and Liberty a $2 million insurance policy.

'The kids did not come around from 2007 when they were cut off.  They showed up in 2013 when they heard Casey was dying - a final, desperate effort to hook into his $80 million estate.  Kerri, along with her Scientologist friends, picketed in front of Jean’s house, Jean received death threats, someone went though their trash.'

Kerri, not surprisingly, completely denied these claims in the same Hollywood Reporter article.  'Absolute lies,' she ranted.  'This will be part of my defamation suit.  I never took loans from my dad and he never cut me off.  We have an irrevocable trust that was set up 30 years ago.'I have never gone a week without either seeing my dad or talking to him on the phone until Jean blocked me, my brother (Mike) and my sister Julie.'
