For those situations where there aren't enough public toilets nearby for the amount of people, new app Airpnp is here to save the day.

Through this revolutionary new mobile app, inspired by Airbnb, residents and businesses can rent out their loos to people in their immediate location who simply need to go.

Users are even able to rate their experiences afterward so others can see how each toilet stacks up.

In instances where you really need to use the loo - but aren't near your home - simply log-on to Airpnp

First conceived of in New Orleans during Mardi Gras, co-founders Travis Laurendine and Max Gaudin routinely experienced the pain of having to pee - without having a place to do it.

Often, visitors and locals alike would opt for a 'rogue pee,' as they describe it, which demonstrated to them the need for a legal alternative.

Currently, the app's most popular areas are New Orleans and - surprisingly - Antwerp, Belgium, but after a quick search, it's clear that some of Central London is hopping on board, as well.

Many of the options we came across were posted by students, advertising their university's washroom facilities. 

From the MailOnline's location, we were able to locate four toilets-for-rent, relatively nearby, in Marylebone

For those who need a shower and toilet in Central London - and have cash to spare - look no further!

That said, we also saw a 'spacious with a shower and very private' advert in Marylebone for £4 per use.

The NY Post likewise investigated Airpnp's prevalence, but in New York City, and found a handful of private addresses, as well as a 'cozy loft-style bathroom' on Smith Street, Brooklyn, at the OrangeYouGlad graphic design studio.

While the bathroom at the back of the office space wasn't sparkling clean, it did boast a large stack of old Esquire magazines, fancy hand soap and 'Poo Pourri' fragrance spray.

'If you're on a busy street in New York, you're literally surrounded by hundreds of toilets but you can't use them because they are in people's apartments,' app founder Travel Laurendine explained to the Post.

Now, with the click of a button, you can check if the toilet is available. The owner then gets a call and can decide if they want to lend out their facilities.
