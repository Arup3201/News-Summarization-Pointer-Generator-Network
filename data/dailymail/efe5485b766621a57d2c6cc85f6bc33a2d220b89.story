Manuel Pellegrini has labelled Monday's clash with Liverpool  a 'six-pointer'.

The Premier League champions welcome Brendan Rodgers' side to the Etihad after pipping them to the title last season.

And Pellegrini was in no doubt as to the importance of the fixture.

Big game: Manuel Pellegrini appreciates the importance of the clash with Liverpool

He said: 'I always say to the players these games are games of six points – especially when you play at home.'

'I think that in the Premier League, there are also four or five strong teams. We hope to win three points at home, it is important to win points at home.'

City pipped Liverpool to the title on the final day of last season, winning by just two points. The Anfield club have since sold talisman Luis Suarez to Barcelona for £75million.

And Pellegrini believes that could affect Liverpool's performance.

'Maybe they will miss Luis Suarez because he is important player,' he added, 'They have also signed important players.' 

Training days: Manchester City prepare for Monday night's match with Liverpool at the Etihad

Raring to go: Frank Lampard has been declared fit to play his part against Liverpool 

Liverpool have had a £16million offer for AC Milan striker Mario Balotelli, who previously played for City. But the Italian will not be eligible to play on Monday, even if the deal goes through this weekend. 

Pellegrini added: 'I was not here with Balotelli. It is not my duty to analyse what happened with him here. Everybody knows the character of Mario Balotelli. Liverpool decide that he is perfect for them and perfect for Mario.'

City will still be without French defender Eliaquim Mangala as he works on his fitness while Alvaro Negredo is a long-term absentee. Frank Lampard and Sergio Aguero, however, will be in the match day squad.  

Pellegrini was coy on the club's plans for the rest of the transfer window, having already signed Mangala, Lampard, Willy Caballero, Fernando and Bacary Sagna.

'For the moment, no news. We will see in the last few days of the window,' the Chilean said. 

Pellegrini also admitted that Negredo may not be named in the club's Champions League squad. The striker could be out for up to two months with a foot injury.

And that's a wrap from the Chilean, we'll have a full report in a few moments.

Pellegrini also praises Edin Dzeko after the striker signed a new deal.

He said: 'I am very pleased because Edin is a very important player for our squad. He is playing well and deserves his contract.'

You've heard of relegation six-pointers, now Pellegrini claims the clash with Liverpool is one at the other end of the table.

'I always say to the players these games are games of six points – especially when you play at home,' he said.

I'll say something, you can't accuse Pellegrini of being anything other than a straight talker.

Asked if last season's failure to win the league will affect Liverpool, he says simply: 'I don't know whether they will be affected. Last season is finished. For Liverpool also.'

Looking towards Monday's game, Pellegrini confirms that Eliaquim Mangala (below) will not be involved against Liverpool.

He does however reveal that Sergio Aguero and Frank Lampard will be available, though they will not be 100 per cent.

Pellegrini is being coy on City's transfer situation.

He says: 'For the moment, no news. We will see in the last few days of the window. ' 

He also refuses to be drawn on speculation regarding Alvaro Negredo and Matija Nastasic.

The boss is in the building!

He is, of course, asked about Balotelli.

Pellegrini says: 'I'm not surprised [he's back]. He is a very good player. He can play anywhere.

'I was not here with Balotelli. It is not my duty to analyse what happened with him here.

'Everybody knows the character of Mario Balotelli. Liverpool decide that he is perfect for them and perfect for Mario.'

Pellegrini has yet to appear at Carrington so why we wait, why not catch up on the latest development in the story that rocked football this week...

The LMA have apologised for the wording of their, em, apology after Malky Mackay was revealed to have sent vile text messages.

Adam Crafton is our man at City today.

He reports: 'Awaiting the arrival of Manuel Pellegrini. The Chilean, of course, did not have the pleasure (?) of managing Mario Balotelli at this club. The Italian left six months before Pellegrini arrived here. Two more opposite characters you could not wish to meet.'

Surely Pellegrini will be asked about the possible Premier League return of former City striker Mario Balotelli?

Liverpool have made a £16million offer for the Milan man but it's unlikely he'll arrive in time to play on Monday.

Sadly for football fans, you'll have to wait until Monday for the biggest game of the Premier League weekend as Manchester City host Liverpool at the Etihad Stadium.

But for now, you can make do with City boss Manuel Pellegrini's pre-match press conference.

I'll bring you live updates from Carrington.
