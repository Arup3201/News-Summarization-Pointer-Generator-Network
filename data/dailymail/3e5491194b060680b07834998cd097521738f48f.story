A Dorset family has claimed they were refused a refund on tickets they did not use because of a bereavement.

Tony Broom, 39, said he was left almost £400 out of pocket for not using flights he had purchased to see his wife Justinya's father in Poland, after he passed away before their scheduled trip.

The family of three had been due to visit the grandfather during the October half-term holidays, but he lost his battle with cancer in August.

According to Ryanair policy, flights can be refunded if a bereavement happens within 28 days of the intended travel date. However, because this was not the case, the family were refused the refund for two months, until they made their quarrel public.

Uncompassionate: Ryanair have angered a family for refusing to refund tickets following a family death

Engineer Tony, 39, told MailOnline Travel that the family had been due to visit his father-in-law in October and paid £398 for five tickets, which included parking at Stansted airport.

Upon learning of his father-in-law's death on August 30, Tony, who did not have travel insurance, attempted to change the  flights to travel to Poland for the September 2 funeral.

He claims he was advised to apply for a refund separately and  buy new tickets for the flights to Poland for the funeral. 'I explained that the [October] tickets were of little use to us now,' Broom said.

'I called and spoke to a Ryanair rep, and he told me the lowest quote for five seats for myself, my wife and our three children would be £1,280,' he said. The family opted to drive instead.

Ryanair refute Mr Broom's claims, stating that the airline has no record of such a phone call. 

The airline tells MailOnline Travel that the cost of changing the flight would amount to £70 per person each way - £700 overall for a family of five. 

Tony Broom was unhappy with the airline's service following the death of his wife Justinya's father

Within days of returning from the funeral, Tony contacted the airline to apply for a refund, providing his father-in-law's death certificate as evidence of the bereavement, but in their response Ryanair directed him to their terms and conditions, which state that only deaths occurring within 28 days allow passengers a refund on tickets.

After three attempts to argue the case with the airline over the past two months, Mr Broom eventually got in touch with Bournemouth Echo, after which Ryanair offered £340 of travel credit - covering their original fares but not the airport parking, which is handled by a different company.

'I don't really want to fly with them again personally, after all the agro I've had to go through to get the credit' Broome said.

'I'm pleased they've offered something, but only after the intervention of the press.'

The airline's terms and conditions state that they will provide a full refund if a passenger has lost an immediate family member within 28 days of intended travel. The policy covers spouses, civil partners, children, siblings, parents, grandparents, grandchildren, parents-in-law and children-in-law.

Airline website states: 

'Should you be affected by a bereavement of an immediate member of your family within 28 days of your intended date of travel and you do not wish to travel, Ryanair will provide a full refund upon application.' 

The website states: 'Should you be affected by a bereavement of an immediate member of your family within 28 days of your intended date of travel and you do not wish to travel, Ryanair will provide a full refund upon application.' 

'They would have had six weeks to refill those seats but they chose not to,' Mr Broom said. 'It doesn't seem very compassionate - it doesn't seem right to me.' 

A spokesperson for Ryanair told MailOnline Travel: 'As stated in our terms and conditions of travel, customers who are affected by a bereavement of an immediate family member within 28 days of their intended date of travel will be provided with a full refund upon application. 

'We convey our sincere condolences to Mr Broom and his family and as a gesture of goodwill, have resolved this matter directly with the customer.'
