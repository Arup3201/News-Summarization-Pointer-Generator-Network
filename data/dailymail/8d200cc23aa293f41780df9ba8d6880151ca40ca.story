Once one of the richest and most powerful figures in Hollywood, Merv Adelson has been taken to court by his third wife over unpaid child support.

Adelson, 83, was once worth $300 million after his TV production company Lorimar has a run of massive hits in the 1980s including The Waltons, Dallas and Knots Landing.

At the height of his success he married Barbara Walters in 1986, but the marriage suffered from their careers being based on different coasts and they divorced in 1992.

Former TV hotshot Merv Adelson, 83, is being sued for unpaid child maintenance by his third wife Thea who is more than 30 years his junior

Adelson had already started a relationship with his third wife Thea, more than 30 years his junior, while still married to Walters. They have two daughters together.

By the late 90s he had moved from film and TV to investing in internet start-ups but lost most of his fortune when the internet bubble famously burst in 2000.

Thea, a lawyer, asked for a divorce in 2003. She got the beach house in Malibu while Adelson now lives in a tiny 500 sq ft studio apartment in Santa Monica.

Adelson, whose properties had once included a ranch in Aspen, recently told Vanity Fair that the thing he misses most about his former opulent lifestyle is his jet.

Adelson appeared before an LA court on Monday over unpaid child support. He is asking for the court to reduce his monthly child support payments from $20,000 to $2,137.

‘Thea’s asking for bigger payments on
arrears,’ Adelson’s lawyer Robert L. Schibel told the New York Post. 
‘She’s asking for 100 percent of what he has coming in.’

Adelson's TV production company Lorimar had a string of hits in the 1980s including the era-defining show Dallas

He claims to have a small income from consulting for Time Warner, which purchased his production company.

Adelson, who has admitted to ties with the Mafia early in his career, was also married to his high-school sweetheart Lori Kaufman back in the 1950s.

He meet Walters in 1985 after a friend’s wife arranged a blind date.

'He was a kind, funny, thoughtful man,' Walters told Vanity Fair last month. 'Would things have worked out differently for Merv if we had stayed together? I don’t know. Probably not I have no regrets.'

His next court date is scheduled for May 16.

Another of Merv Adelson's 1980s TV successes was the Dallas spin-off Knots Landing
