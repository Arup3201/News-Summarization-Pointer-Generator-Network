A 20-year-old woman who had a rare genetic disorder that kept her looking like a toddler has died.

Brooke Greenberg remained physically and cognitively similar to a toddler, with an estimated mental age of nine months to one year.

She died last week and her cause of death remains unknown.

'While the outside world may have noticed Brooke’s physical stature and been puzzled by her unique development state, she brought joy and love to her family,' Rabbi Andrew Busch said during his eulogy, according to The New York Daily News.

'Her parents, three sisters and extended family showered her with love and respected her dignity throughout her entire life.'

In January of this year, Brooke and her family- including her 17-year-old sister- made an appearance on Katie Couric's talk show.

They told how she is unable to talk, still has her baby teeth and like any infant, travels in a push chair - but doctors have never been able to explain why.

Her father, Howard Greenberg, explained: 'From age one to four, Brooke changed. She got a little bit bigger. But age four, four to five, she stopped.'

She has been examined by some of the most prestigious medical institutions in the U.S., however no formal diagnosis for Brooke’s condition has been given, leading doctors to term her condition Syndrome X.

Dr Eric Schadt, director of the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology at The Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, explained that she has 'no apparent abnormalities in her endocrine system, no gross chromosomal abnormalities, or any of the other disruptions known to occur in humans that can cause developmental issues.'

Brooke stayed the same size for 15 years and required 24-hour care from her parents.

She is fed through a tube inserted into her stomach, because her oesophagus is so small that swallowed food could back up into her lungs and cause pneumonia.

Her mother, Melanie Greenberg, said: 'It's been 16 years of on the job training, giving her medicine, knowing when she's sick, knowing the right amount.'

Sisterly love: Tests have shown that Brooke, who is three years older than her sister, may suffer from a gene mutation that switches off her ability to mature

Happy: The family said that they knew it was difficult for outsiders to understand Brooke- since even some of the world's best doctors didn't have a clue

Mr Greenberg added: 'The key with Brooke is we don't know what tomorrow brings.'

Scientists believe her unique genetic code could provide a fresh insight into the process of aging, leading to the development of new treatments for diseases related to old age, such as Parkinson's.

Tests have shown that Brooke, who was born in 1993, may have suffered from a gene mutation that switches off her ability to mature.

One of the factors that was the most difficult for doctors to diagnose was the fact that she had no obvious causes from a genetic standpoint.

A leading genetics expert reported that there were 'no apparent abnormalities in her 
endocrine system, no gross chromosomal abnormalities, or any of the 
other disruptions known to occur in humans that can cause developmental 
issues.'

In spite of that, Brooke stayed the same size for 15 years.

Much of the problem stemmed from the fact that different parts of her body were running out of sync from one another.

'Various
 parts of her body, rather than all being at the same stage, seem to be 
disconnected,' Dr. Richard Walker of the University of South Florida 
College of Medicine said in 2009.

When her condition was profiled by 
Dateline when she was 8-years-old in 2001, she weighed about 13 pounds 
which is standard for children at about six months old.

She
 stayed about the same weight for many years after that, but in 2009 Dr 
Walker reported that she had the mental capacity of a 9-month-old child.

Dr Schadt is in the process of sequencing Brooke’s genome, which is comprised of two long strings of letters, one from the mother and one from the father.

Each string is three billion letters long, and changes in just one of these letters can lead to profound effects on development, physical appearance, and risk of disease.

According to ABC News, in the first six years of her life, Brooke suffered series of medical emergencies from which she recovered, often without explanation.

She survived surgery for seven 
perforated stomach ulcers, and suffered a brain seizure followed by a 
stroke that weeks later left no apparent damage.

Then
 at age four, she fell into a coma that caused her to sleep for 14 days.
 Doctors diagnosed a brain tumor, which disappeared by the time she 
awoke.

Dr Schadt hopes to 
find out whether any abnormal genes identified in Brooke 'are involved 
in aging related processes, whether manipulating these genes could 
increase longevity and/or reduce aging related disorders such as 
Alzheimer’s, heart disease and many forms of cancer,' he said.

Mrs
 Greenberg, who said during the Katie appearance that she loves Brooke 
the way she is, explained that if another mother with a toddler asks her
 how old Brooke is, she usually doesn't answer truthfully.

'My system always has been to turn years into months. So, if someone asked today, I might say, she's [20] months old,' she said.

Many
 doctors examined Brooke during her life, and one of the most shocking 
discoveries was that none of her genomes were distinctly abnormal.

Instead, much of the problem stemmed from the fact that different parts of her body were running out of sync from one another.

'Various parts of her body, rather than all being at the same stage, seem to be disconnected,' Dr. Richard Walker of the University of South Florida College of Medicine said in 2009.

One of the clearest examples of this is based on the fact that her brain was believed to have developed past different parts of her body.

When her condition was profiled by Dateline when she was 8-years-old in 2001, she weighed about 13 pounds which is standard for children at about six months old.

She stayed about the same weight for many years after that, but in 2009 Dr Walker reported that she had the mental capacity of a 9-month-old child.

Brooke's case, while extremely rare, is not believed to be the only one of it's kind.

There are two other clear examples of individuals with very similar situations, though none of them have been categorically solved.
