This is the story of two players.

The first is a young striker who does well at a club which is established in the Premier League, but which doesn’t have a recent history of challenging for cups or the top four.

His talents catch the eye of certain clubs who are challenging for such honours.

Naturally the player wants to go and test himself at that higher level.

He is open and honest about it, he pledges to do all he can to score goals and help his current team stay up, before making it clear he wants to move on when the season is over.

This player is Saido Berahino; he is vilified, dropped and labelled a troublemaker and a problem player, who has ‘baggage’.

Berahino was dropped by West Brom boss Tony Pulis for the weekend's 2-2 draw against Burnley

Berahino has been a success at Under 21 level and has been courted by several Premier League clubs

The second player is also a young striker, he says absolutely nothing publicly, keeps on doing well and scoring goals for his club in a relegation battle, but knows he will be allowed to leave his club for nothing, earn a bumper wage and a big signing on fee when the season is over, whether they stay up or not.

This player is Danny Ings; he is loved and admired by pretty much everybody, and he’s never criticised.

I really like Ings, and admire his career path, as well as the way he plays. But is he worthy of more praise and respect just because he is not telling the fans anything about his future? There is a strong possibility that having given the player a great opportunity in the game, Burnley Football Club could be left with nothing this summer.

Some might say that he will be allowed to leave on a free transfer with the blessing of the Burnley fans if he scores the goals to keep them up. Will the same warmth be offered to Berahino at West Bromwich Albion? It doesn’t look likely, so what’s the difference?

Is it down to a couple of incidents off the field? There are plenty of Premier League players who have similar – worse - difficulties but those are virtually forgotten in an instant (West Ham’s James Tomkins is a recent example), so surely it can’t be that.

Danny Ings' situation mirrors that of Berahino, yet the Burnley striker is not viewed as being difficult

Ings has netted eight times this season, compared to Berahino's nine, and both men are highly courted

Ings put Burnley 2-0 up at Turf Moor, only to see his side pegged back by a sterling West Brom fightback

Some have suggested Berahino has been badly advised. Really? Let’s get this straight – he’s gone on record and said he wants to do well for West Brom, keep them up, and then go on to bigger things. He’s been honest with the fans and everyone about his plans for the future. What’s wrong with being honest? Should he be advised to lie, or not be up front with the fans who pay his wages?

And he’s been criticised for doing an interview without the club’s permission. One of the worst features of the modern game in this country is how far removed players are from fans in the Premier League. But worse than that, it seems players are gagged while it’s fine for a club to say what it wants about a player - Berahino has been in the naughty chair? Seriously, Tony Pulis, with comments like that is the player likely to change his mind and stay?

Pulis also said Berahino lacks ‘mentors’, highlighting that he lost his father at an early age, and blaming this for his desire to play at a higher level and earn more money. I know from personal experience how growing up without a father stacks the odds against you. Rather than stare down from some sort of mythical moral high ground, maybe Pulis should applaud Berahino for coming so far with so little in his favour.

We have recently heard stories about Berhaino allegedly being late for training. Why would a club with class like West Bromwich Albion leak information like that? It only serves to damage the player’s reputation. Spend any time at any club and you’ll know players are regularly late for training and meetings, they pay an internal fine and it never gets out. Why is Berahino being singled out here?

Berahino appears to have been singled out by his club for a minor breach of discipline

Both Ings and Berahino are said to have caught the eye of the likes of rivals Liverpool and Spurs

This is a kid who has come through a difficult early life, he’s been given a great chance at West Brom, and he’s taken it. That football club are set to make a fortune from his sale, and assuming they stay up they will be grateful for the goals he scored to contribute to that survival bid.

Meanwhile Danny Ings, also scoring goals to help Burnley stay up, says nothing to the fans, and will make his club no money if he leaves this summer.

So who’s the bad guy? Neither player deserves criticism yet Berahino is being hounded.

Sources close to Berahino have wondered if there could be racist undertones to the vilification of this young talent: he’s black and he wasn’t born in England. I refuse to believe that, and I sincerely hope it isn’t true.

But what is true is that the Saido Berahino witch-hunt is getting ridiculous.
