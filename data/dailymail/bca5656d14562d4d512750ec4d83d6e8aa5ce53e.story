Dying novelist Iain Banks has said he will send letters to the authors who inspired him to write.

Speaking for the first time since being diagnosed with terminal cancer, he also told fans he felt 'treasured and loved' after announcing he had only months to live.

Those who would receive a letter of thanks include fellow author Alasdair Gray.

The author said he would continue to post 'the occasional update' on his blog for as long as he was able

The sci-fi writer said: 'I need to tell other writers how much their work has meant to me while they are (and I am) still alive.

'Means writing yet more letters, but I feel it'd be hypocritical of me not to, now.

'I think I'll start with the amazing Mr Alasdair Gray.'

Banks also revealed that he honeymooned in Venice and Paris with his new wife Adele.

The author asked her to become his 'widow' after learning of the fatal illness.

In a new blog post he also praised the
care he received at Edinburgh Royal Infirmary after he developed a 
medical complication while travelling back from France.

The 59-year-old shocked fans around 
the world earlier this month by revealing he had a terminal cancer which
was spreading from his gall bladder.

In a blog post on a fan website at 
the weekend, his first public statement since his initial revelation, he
said he was astounded at the level of support he received.

The Wasp Factory author wrote: 
'Discovering the sheer extent and depth of the feelings people have 
expressed on the message board over the past two weeks has been truly 
astounding.

'I feel treasured, I feel loved, I 
feel I've done more than just pursue the craft I adore and make a living
from it, and more than just fulfil the only real ambition I've ever had
- of becoming a professional writer.

'I am deeply flattered and touched, and I can't deny I've been made to feel very special indeed.'

He also said some messages had been 
'rationality challenged': 'And I am, of course, deeply happy that I have
attracted the attentions of a few of our - how can I put this politely?
- more rationality-challenged friends. To have stirred up none at all 
would have been almost suspicious.

'Mostly, though - good grief! - what an outpouring of love, affection and respect. I honestly had no idea.'

After he and long-term partner Adele 
Hartley married over the Easter weekend at Inverlochy Castle Hotel in 
the Highlands they travelled to Venice followed by Paris.

He said his statement was 'cunningly 
timed to hit the outerweb just as we were heading away on honeymoon to 
mostly-sunny-with-a-touch-of-rain Venice and then 
mostly-rainy-with-a-touch-of-sun Paris.'

The blog post continued: 'Even after 
we had, technically, arrived back home it was still a few more days 
before I could lay my tousled locks on our own pillows; I had to get off
the train at Waverley station on Thursday and head straight to the 
Edinburgh Royal Infirmary after feeling distinctly dodgy in Paris that 
morning.

'I was kept in until Tuesday (though I
did have a day pass that let me come home for a while over Sunday/early
Monday... nothing about any of this is simple)

'The upshot is that a partial blockage
of the stent that was emplaced earlier appears to have been dealt with 
in a procedure that took place on Monday afternoon and my bilirubin 
levels have started to come down again.

'Anyway, I'm back home now, after a 
basically brilliant honeymoon/holiday and a good-as-it-could-be stay at 
the very shiny and expertise-stuffed ERI.'

He added he had worked on his new 
novel The Quarry while on holiday, while Adele monitored posts on the 
Banksophilia fan website.

Fans' suggestions of medical treatment and research would 'be looked at seriously', he said.

He also heaped praise on his fans: 'Of
course I've always known I have a fair few fans, and I've always been a
fan of my fans - certainly of those who turned up at signing sessions, 
bookshop events, literary festivals, library gigs and so on.

'The people I spoke to on these 
occasions always seemed bright, clever, highly informed and sometimes 
worryingly more intelligent than me (see - somebody really intelligent 
would have written 'I' there).

'As well as displaying immense good taste in literature, obviously.'

He said he would continue to post 'the occasional update' for as long as he was able.

The Quarry is due to be published on 20 June.
