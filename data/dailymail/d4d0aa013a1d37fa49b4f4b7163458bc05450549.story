Former Juventus manager Antonio Conte is the new coach of Italy after signing a two-year contract worth £2.8million per year.

The Italian football federation announced the appointment on Thursday, three days after new president Carlo Tavecchio was elected.

The 45-year-old Conte replaces Cesare Prandelli, who resigned - along with former FIGC president Giancarlo Abete - immediately after Italy's early elimination from the World Cup in Brazil.

Conte quit Juventus during the summer after easing to three consecutive title wins, leading to rumours linking him with the vacant role in the national side.

His salary will increase from the £2.8million a year he made at Juve and the Italian FA have reportedly sought help from sponsors Puma in order to help pay Conte's wages.

It will leave the former midfielder, who was a part of Italy's 1994 World Cup squad, behind Russia manager Fabio Capello.
