A man who fathered 26 children by 15 different women is to win £1,000 compensation from public money because his local council can't find him a big enough house.

Peter Rolfe, 64, who appeared on Channel 5's Benefits Britain, has been living in a three-bedroom house in Newport, Isle of Wight, with seven of his children for the past three years.

Mr Rolfe, who has 14 daughters and 12 sons, was branded 'Britain's most feckless father' by former Tory MP Anne Widdecombe after he appeared on the reality TV show.

Father of 26 Peter Rolfe, with some of his family, may get compensation for not getting a bigger council home

Mr Rolfe, 64, who suffers arthritis and diabetes, walks with a stick and has one eye, says he needs more space

The father of 14 girls and 12 boys aged three to 40 says his current three bed home, above, is too small for him

He claims £32,678 a year in benefits in the form of child tax credits, family allowance, disability benefits, housing benefits and a state pension, but now he is set to claim even more after the Local Government Ombudsman ruled that his local council had failed him.

It declared that Isle of Wight Council had failed in its duty to find one-eyed Mr Rolfe, who walks with a stick, a bigger house for his family to live in.

Now councillors must meet to decide whether to pay him £1,000 compensation, having previously agreed on a figure of £250. 

Mr Rolfe, who suffers from arthritis and diabetes, said: 'My kids are suffering because they've got no space. 

'The council is not doing enough to find us another house, even though the ombudsman said it was in the wrong.

'We have been waiting years for a bigger house - I'll be dead before they even think about giving me one.

'£1,000 would help immensely: any money is a help.'

Angry: Mr Rolfe, who is unmarried, said: 'My kids are suffering because they've got no space'

When Benefits Britain was screened earlier this year, none of Mr Rolfe's children, who range in age from three to 40, was in employment. 

But their father, who is unmarried, and claims he is stopped in the street to give autographs, is unrepentant.

He said: 'Some people slag me off for claiming benefits but I am not on the dole.  I am a pensioner.

'Most of the country are on benefits.'  

A spokesman for Isle of Wight Council said a decision on whether the council would pay the £1,000 would be taken at a meeting of the council executive 'in the near future'.

They said that the council was 'working within its own policies' and added: 'We are continuing efforts to identify accommodation large enough for the family.

'The council has been exploring a number of options, including identifying two properties next to each other which could be reconfigured. To date no suitable accommodation has been found.'
