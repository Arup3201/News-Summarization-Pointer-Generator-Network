Rihanna and Miley Cyrus were responsible for putting intricate hand chains on the fashion map last season. But now the quirky jewellery design is going further south.

The latest accessory trend to sweep the fashion world is leg chains: an intricate piece of jewellery you drape across your thigh or even the entire length of your leg.

Spotted on the style set over London Fashion Week, written about by fashion bloggers and posted in photos all over Instagram, the off-beat jewellery trend looks set to take the new season by storm.

Leg chain trend: The latest trend to be spotted over London Fashion Week was leg chains, but would you wear the blingy accessory?

'The novelty of leg chains is that they can be worn with just about anything,' says LegChain.com, a site that champions the trend.

'You can wear them over jeans and leggings for a punk rock edge, or merely go bare and let the metal brush across smooth skin,' they add.

The chains come in silver and gold hued metallics as well as black and more vibrant colours like red.

The designs, which are pulled on around the leg like a garter or attach to underwear, can be simple and understated design or more eye-catching, adorned with beads and charms.

The chains, which are being sold on eBay for as little as £1.59, can even be worn over jeans to brighten them up for winter.
