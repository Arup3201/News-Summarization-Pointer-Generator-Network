Jose Mourinho admits Diego Costa can do 'almost nothing' between matches as Chelsea’s medical department patch up their £32million striker in an attempt to keep him on the pitch.

Costa scored his eighth of the season as Mourinho’s team beat Aston Villa 3-0 at Stamford Bridge yesterday to stay top of the Barclays Premier League and extend their unbeaten start.

The Chelsea boss wants the Brazil-born Spain international striker to start again at Sporting Lisbon on Tuesday and at home to Arsenal next Sunday, but knows he must be handled with extreme care.

Chelsea face a dilemma over how best to use injury-hit in-form striker Diego Costa

Jose Mourinho admits that Chelsea are powerless to help Costa unless he gets extended rest

'He is doing almost nothing,' said Mourinho. 'He’s just resting and recovering from the tight muscle he has every time he accumulates fatigue. I hope he goes home after this game and sleeps until tomorrow morning.

'He cannot be at the top of his game but even so, scoring a goal is good for his confidence, especially for a player who isn’t training as he should because we are protecting him.'

Chelsea would like Spain to give Costa time to rest the injury during next month’s international break but will not make a formal request to their manager Vicente del Bosque.

Spain manager Vincente del Bosque will have the final say over whether to call up Costa for the national team

Mourinho added: 'If he doesn’t go to the national team, and stays here 15 days on treatment, recovering and making the muscle and the areas around muscle stronger, he has the perfect chance to be top for Chelsea and top for national team.

'If he doesn’t have this period, he will be always play one game and then be in trouble for the next one. The muscle is tight and the muscle is in danger to have a rupture.

'We can’t do anything. I can’t speak to Spain manager. It’s not something I should do. From moment they are selected for national team the players belong to them. Everything is in their hands and you have to respect the decisions.”

Oscar opened the scoring for Chelsea in the seventh minute before Costa headed in the second and made the third for Willian.

'We are happy with what we are doing,' said Mourinho. 'We are not perfect and we have a lot to improve in every area of our game but we are playing well. We have a lead of three points over Southampton, and this is very important. It is not crucial because it’s too early but it is a little bit of space and it gives you a good feeling to be top of the league.'
