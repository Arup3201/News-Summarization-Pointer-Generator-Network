Fears of a massive volcanic eruption in Iceland have been fuelled by yet another earthquake which has shifted 50million cubic metres of molten rock towards another volcano.

It has been reported that a magnitude 4.5 quake hit a volcanic system close to the Bardarbunga volcano in the early hours of this morning with experts warning it could link up with the Askja volcanic system and cause a huge eruption.

It comes after an earthquake reached a magnitude of 5.7 yesterday, potentially leading Iceland to yet again bring the warning code to red level.

Shaken: Another earthquake has hit Iceland's Bardarbunga volcano, shifting 50million cubic metres of molten rock

The intense seismic activity at Iceland's largest volcano system has raised worries that an eruption could cause another ash cloud like that from the Eyjafjallajokull volcano in 2010 that shut down much of Europe's airspace for six days.

Experts say it is difficult to predict if volcanoes will erupt, however they say 50million cubic metres of molten rock has moved over the last 24 hours.

Professor Bob White, from the University of Cambridge told BBC News: 'We know there is a lot of molten rock sitting under the ground beneath Askja, which is a major volcanic system. If this molten rock hits that, we know it is likely to trigger it to erupt.

'But who knows, it may just stop. It is still at five kilometres depth, and it is possible it could freeze there and not a lot more will happen. That is perfectly plausible.

'If it keeps going north, it keeps feeding molten rock and it hits the Askja system and triggers that - then goodness knows what will happen. It could make a lot of disruptive ash all over Iceland.'

On Sunday, Iceland lowered its warning code for possible volcanic disruption to the aviation industry to orange from red, the highest level on the country's five-point alert system, after concluding that seismic activity had not led to a volcanic eruption under the glacier.

Trembling times: Although the earthquake has not caused an eruption, there are fears of a repeat scenario of the Eyjafjallajokull ash cloud in 2010

Red alert indicates an eruption is imminent or underway with a significant emission of ash likely.

Met Office scientists believe the earthquakes are a result of magma flowing out from under the crater of the volcano, causing a change in pressure.

‘We still can't say whether it will cease, continue like this for a while or erupt. It's impossible to say,’ Palni Erlendsson, a geologist at the Icelandic Meteorological Office said.

There have been thousands of smaller quakes over the past week at Bardarbunga, and areas around the volcano, in the centre of the North Atlantic island nation, have been evacuated.

However, before an eruption air travel will not be affected, a spokesman for the UK Civil Aviation Authority said last week.

'The (UK) Met Office will be monitoring what's occurring. They will be sending out forecasts about the atmosphere and any ash in the air,' he said.

'If the eruption does occur we will issue what's called a notice to airmen informing them of the conditions. It's then up to the airlines with their safety teams and experts whether to fly.'
