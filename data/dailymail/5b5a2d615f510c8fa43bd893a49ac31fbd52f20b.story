This is the moment a hapless sailor was rescued five miles off the coast of Dorset last night - after attempting to sail 3,000 miles to America in a 14ft dinghy.

The 30-year-old Bulgarian national purchased the £300 boat from Christchurch harbour yesterday before setting off on his voyage.

He was spotted looking seasick in choppy seas at around 5pm by a passing yachtsman, who called the coastguard.

An RNLI lifeboat crew from Mudeford was called to help the man, who had a U.S. visa on board, but he refused their assistance for 45 minutes.

The sailor, a 30-year-old from Bulgaria, was seen in his 14ft dinghy by another boat, five miles off the coast of Dorset

The man was spotted looking seasick in chopping seas by a passing yachtsman, who called the coastguard to come and help

Despite his reluctance, the sailor was dragged onto the RNLI lifeboat. Crew said he was suffering the first signs of hypothermia

He was eventually dragged onto the RNLI lifeboat and taken to shore, where police and an ambulance crew were waiting.

He has since been released from hospital and is staying with a well-wisher. He also returned to the station to meet staff, where he was told not to attempt his journey again.

When he was found, yhe man was not wearing a life jacket, his boat did not have any lights and the only navigational aid in his possession was a street map of Southampton.

He had packed himself a bag of food, consisting of baked beans, hotdogs and biscuits, as well as a bag of clothes.

Pete Dadds, 41, a lifeboat crewman who attended the incident, said the man would have died if he had not been rescued.

'When we reached the gentleman he didn't want us there, he wanted to carry on his way,' the commercial fisherman said.

'We were not happy leaving him out there. He kept saying 'I am going west'.

'His boat was not properly rigged so he was just getting battered, he was at the mercy of the elements.

The man had been violently sick when he boarded the RNLI lifeboat. He has seen been given accommodation by a 'well-wisher'

'We said "if we leave you you will die". 
He didn't have a life-jacket, just a buoyancy aid and the vessel didn't 
have any lights.'

He added: 'All he had on was a bag of personal belongings which were a few odds and ends, a bag of biscuits, beans and hot dogs and a bag with his passport in.

'He was 
obviously suffering from the first signs of hypothermia. He was only 
wearing a pack-a-mac jacket and leggings. He was absolutely sodden.'

The man boarded the RNLI lifeboat, where he was violently sea sick and 'very, very cold', Mr Dadds added.

'I ended up cuddling him at the back of the boat to keep him warm,' he said.

'He would have died, he was severely sea sick, he had the first signs of hypothermia and his boat was filling up with water.

The man was trying to sail to America in a £300 14ft 
dinghy with no lights, no life jacket and rudimentary supplies (file picture)

'There's no chance it would have kept going for much longer.'

Mr Dadds said the sailor was 'incredibly lucky' the yacht had been passing him and had contacted the coastguard.

The RNLI crew arrived back at Mudeford at around 6.30pm and the man was immediately taken to hospital by the waiting ambulance.

His boat was then towed back to shore by the crew.

Richard Stride, lifeboat operations manager at Mudeford, told MailOnline that the sailor had been discharged from hospital and had since been given accommodation by a well-wisher.

He said the man had been back to the station where he had a long chat with one of the staff.

He said: 'He was telling the man how inadvisable it would be for him to attempt to do it again. So hopefully he won't try it.

'I know from those that have spoken to him that he did not just set off for America. I think what he was trying to do is go westwards and then find someone who could take him the whole way.'
