Switch: Pochettino moved to Spurs after a successful 17 months spell at Premier League rivals Southampton

Despite having spent 17 months in England after taking over from Nigel Atkins as Saints manager and having a decent grasp on the language, the Argentine insisted upon having his words translated on video to avoid misinterpretation.

But in this new interview with Spurs TV – which will have fans desperate for the season to start – the 42-year-old spoke clearly in English about the demands of his coaching staff on the team.

‘The players don’t have to be afraid,’ Pochettino said.

‘Our style is demanding - sometimes too much but we use common sense. We demand a lot from them because that is our style.

‘Our philosophy is “suffer in training so you don't suffer in the game”. But the players don’t have to be afraid because we work with common sense all the time.

‘We can only expect full commitment and a positive attitude [from the players].’

Pochettino’s words will delight Spurs fans who accused some members of the squad for shirking their responsibilities in a disappointing season under Andre Villas Boas and Tim Sherwood.

The 20-cap former Argentina international also confirmed that he will keep Steffen Freund as part of his coaching staff.

The German will be joined by assistant head coach Jesus Perez, first team coach Miguel D’Agostino and goalkeeping coach Toni Jiminez, who all follow Pochettino from Southamption.

And native Spanish speaker Pochettino, who is Spurs’ 10th manager in just 13 years praised his new employer – admitting they were a step up from Southampton despite just two places separating them in the Premier League last season.

‘It is an absolute honour to be a coach at such a big club,’ he added. ‘I am very happy to be here.

‘We will try to give everything to make you proud of this football club.’
