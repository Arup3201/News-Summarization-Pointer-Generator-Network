Jean Ahmed, who claimed that her partner, with whom she had four children was her landlord to claim over £120,000 in benefits 

A mother-of-four has been jailed after claiming her partner was her landlord as part of a £120,000 benefits scam.

Jean Ahmed, of South Shields admitted falsely pretending to be a single parent in order to claim benefits she was not entitled to.

Newcastle Crown Court heard that the 43-year-old's partner owned the house where she lived and secret surveillance proved they were living together as a couple.

For 12 years between 2001 and 2013 she was paid income support, job seekers allowance as well as housing and council tax benefits amounting to a total of £123,201, which she was not entitled to.

The court was told that when she was confronted by investigators she said: 'I knew this day would come.'

Today Ahmed, a student at Sunderland University admitted four charges of benefit fraud and Mr Recorder Euan Duff then sentenced her to 15 months in prison.

He told her: 'The benefits system benefits those in need, who deserve money and who depend upon it.

'It is harmed by people of your sort who dishonestly take huge amounts from the public purse.'

But the judge said he accepted Ahmed was sorry for what she had done and that she has 'many positive sides' to her character.

Prosecutor Tony Cornberg told the court investigations based on banking documents and finance forms showed Ahmed's partner was living with her at the house, as well as being the owner of it.

Mr Cornberg said: 'He owned the house and she was the tenant.

'Surveillance was conducted between August 2012 and April 2013 at the address.

'Her partner was leaving and returning regularly.

'When interviewed she confirmed the two were in a relationship and had four children together.

'She summed up in a statement saying she knew this day would come.'

Vic Laffey, defending, said Ahmed had 'glowing' references from people who knew her and has done a huge amount of work for her community, including

involvement in an arts project for people with learning difficulties and a play group for disabled children.

Mr Laffey said: 'She has accepted this day was coming and she has lived with

the dread of it for a long time.

'She is concerned for her children above all else. It takes precedence over

concern for her own welfare, without a shadow of a doubt.'
