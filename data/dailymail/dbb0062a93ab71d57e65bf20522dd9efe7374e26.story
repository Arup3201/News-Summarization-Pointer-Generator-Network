To many it is as much a part of Christmas as turkey or carolling, but families will have to dig deeper in their pockets to afford this year’s festive edition of Radio Times.

The two-week special edition of the listings magazine, which goes on sale next Wednesday, will cost £3.20 – a rise of 14 per cent on last year’s issue, which cost £2.80.

The increase is also a 45 per cent jump in price in just four years.

However, at least readers will be able to welcome back Santa Claus to the magazine’s cover for the first time since 2009, after he was removed so as not to upset cash-strapped families who couldn’t afford presents following the onset of the financial crisis.

The 294-page Christmas issue will have a print run of almost 2.5 million copies, up from the normal weekly run of 900,000. Last year’s issue, which had The Snowman and the Snowdog on the front cover, sold 2.17 million copies.

A total of 48 pages of advertising have been booked, up on 40 last year, which will bring in more than £2million. When sales are included, the Christmas edition is expected to make around £7.5million for the publishers, Immediate Media.

Father Christmas was banished from the festive edition’s front cover in 2010, with the publisher claiming that a ‘symbol of the boom years’ wasn’t reflective of the nation’s mood during an economic crisis.

A picture of Wallace and Gromit was used in 2010, and a ‘festive flowing illustration’ of a Christmas tree in 2011, which it felt better reflected the tough economic climate by ‘harking back to simpler times’.

Radio Times was sold by the BBC in 2011 to private equity company Exponent. The deal was part of a £121million sell-off involving 11 titles owned by the corporation, including Gardens Illustrated.
