Whether you are a Christmas Grinch or already irritating your co-workers with your festive cheer, there can be no avoiding the advent of the holiday season.

The tree at Claridge’s hotel in London has brought joy and wonderment to hundreds for decades, with its grand unveiling each year epitomising the start of the Christmas season for many.

For the past four years the tree has been decorated by a top designer and this year Claridge’s has announced that fashion duo Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana will be overseeing the design.

The tree in the Claridge's lobby has become synonymous with Christmas for both Londoners and visitors

The tree always tells a stunning visual story, and this year, under Dolce and Gabbana it will depict elements from a traditional Christmas combined with influences from the designers’ Italian heritage.

Hand crafted Sicilian puppets, known as ‘pupi’ will adorn the tree alongside hand-painted Italian festive glass baubles and a bespoke multi-coloured ‘luminarie’ framework created in Southern Italy.

The entire structure will stand at 6.8 metres and will be painstakingly transported over from Italy and erected over night by Claridge's staff to greet guests as they descend for breakfast on the morning of 26 November.

Dolce and Gabbana commented on swapping clothes for conifers and foliage.

‘When we think of London we always think of Claridge’s and of its typically English atmosphere that fascinates us and makes us fall in love with the city every time as if it were the first,' they said.

‘Our Christmas tree isn’t only a celebration of Christmas as we celebrate it in Italy, but it’s at the same time a tribute to the artisanal Italian tradition, the same that we love to export worldwide with everything we do.’

Speaking about the collaboration Claridge’s General Manager Thomas Kochs says: ‘We are delighted to welcome Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana to spread their special Christmas magic in our lobby this year.

‘Both Claridge’s and Dolce and Gabbana are synonymous with timeless glamour, innovative spirit and traditional family values that are so important at this time of year.’

Last year the tree was created by Kally Ellis, founder of renowned British floral designers McQueens

In 2011 the tree was decorated by Lanvin and featured a family of puppets in a Christmas scenee

Over the past four years the tree, designed by John Galliano for Dior and Alber Elbaz for Lanvin, has become a festive landmark, drawing visitors and Londoners alike to the ancient Mayfair hotel. 

Last year the tree was created by Kally Ellis, founder of renowned British floral designers McQueens, who created a breath-taking natural forest tree featuring magnolia branches and lichen moss, studded with crystal and emerald jewel eggs in white, gold and silver. 

The new tree will be unveiled in Claridge’s iconic lobby on November 26.
