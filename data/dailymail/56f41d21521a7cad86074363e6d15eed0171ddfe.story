Victor: Elanor Laing won the Deputy Speaker position by 257 votes to 240

Tory MP Eleanor Laing has been elected Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons, beating six other candidates.

The Conservative MP for Epping Forest, the favourite for the role, saw off Conservative Brian Binley by 257 votes to 240.

She will join John Bercow’s team after Nigel Evans stood down to fight sex offence charges last month, and will be one of three deputies to stand in for Mr Bercow.

The position carries a salary premium of £36,360 on top of an MP’s salary, so she will receive a total of £102,098 a year.

Miss Laing, who was a shadow justice minister in 2009, was forced to pay back £25,000 in the MPs’ expenses scandal and saw off an attempt to have her deselected as MP for Epping Forest.

She won a vote of confidence from her local party after anger that she sold her state-funded second home for a £1million profit without paying capital gains tax by calling it her ‘primary residence’.

After an outcry, she offered to pay back the money as a ‘moral gesture’.

Miss Laing said yesterday: ‘May I also 
on behalf of all the candidates who took part thank each of the other 
candidates for the demure and pleasant way in which this election has 
been conducted, and may I thank the House for placing their confidence 
in me to let me become part of your team.’

Mr Bercow said yesterday:
‘I congratulate the honourable lady warmly, and I may say on behalf of 
my colleagues and myself that we all greatly look forward to working 
with her.’ As a Conservative, Mr Evans could only be replaced by another
governing-party MP under Commons rules - although no Lib Dems applied.

Ahead of the election, Miss Laing spoke of the Commons’ ‘vital, essential role as a forum for national debate’, adding: ‘I would like to be part of the Speaker’s team, not just to keep order in the chamber but to stand up for the rights of the backbenches... against overbearing governments.’

Excited: Speaker John Bercow said he was looking forward to working with Miss Laing

This week she expressed sympathy for more family-friendly hours in parliament, which can sit past 10pm, but did not make a firm pledge to change them.

There were six rounds of voting as no MP managed to get over 50 per cent.

Henry 
Bellingham came third with a final tally of 156 votes, Gary Streeter 
fourth with 95, and former transport minister Simon Burns fifth with 70 
votes. David Amess was sixth with 28 and former I’m a Celebrity 
contestant Nadine Dorries came last, gaining 13 votes in the first 
round.
