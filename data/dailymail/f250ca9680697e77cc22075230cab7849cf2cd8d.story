Ahead of Germany's huge World Cup semi-final showdown with hosts Brazil in Belo Horizonte, Sportsmail takes a closer look at Joachim's Low's side.

Player of the tournament: Manuel Neuer (5 games, 3 clean sheets)

The Bayern Munich stopper was already widely regarded as one of the finest keepers in the world, but this World Cup has seen his stock rise even more. Strings of fine saves combined with his adventurous sweeper keeper role have played a big role in helping Germany progress.

Tournament highlight: Comfortably beating the Portuguese

The gauntlet was thrown down when Germany blew Cristiano Ronaldo and Portugal to pieces in the opening game with a stunning 4-0 win.

Billed as one of the biggest matches of the group stage, Joachim Low’s team had the game won at half-time after going 3-0 up before Thomas Muller completed a hat-trick in the second half. The demolition of a fierce group rival inside 45 minutes was enough to convince many that Germany were only heading for the latter stages (again).

Tournament lowlight: Struggling past Algeria

But just when you thought Low’s team were shoe-ins for the quarter-finals they so nearly blew it in the last 16 against Algeria.

Expected to cruise past the African side, Die Mannschaft’s high defensive line was constantly exploited by the minnows who time and time again were fumbled by Neuer – who was playing as a keeper, a centre-back and a right-back as he ridiculously charged out his goal at all costs to soak up one defensive error after another. Germany would eventually squeeze through 2-1 after extra time.

Best goal: Andre Schurrle v Algeria, 2-1 last 16, Estadio Beira-Rio (Porto Alegre)

There won’t be many German strikes in contender for winning goal of the tournament, but Andre Schurrle’s clever and instinctive back flick to turn home a low Thomas Muller’s cross proved crucial in helping Germany break the deadlock against Algeria in extra-time.

How has the boss performed?

Low’s
 starting to become part of the furniture in the Germany set-up having 
taken over from Jurgen Klinsmann in 2006, and he has delivered a fourth 
straight major semi-final.

Only
 trophies will satisfy a side who have been potless since 1996 though, 
and while Germany are making progress, questions have been raised on his
 faith in deploying a sweeper keeper – a tactic which was dangerously 
close to back firing against Algeria.

Killer stat: Germany are unbeaten against tournament hosts in their last eight matches in a World Cup or European Championship, since losing to England in the 1966 World Cup final.
