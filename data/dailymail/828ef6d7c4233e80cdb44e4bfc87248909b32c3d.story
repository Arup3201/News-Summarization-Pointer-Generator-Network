New planning minister Nick Boles is facing accusations of hypocrisy after details of his 'Green Belt' upbringing emerged yesterday

New planning minister Nick Boles is facing accusations of hypocrisy after details of his ‘Green Belt’ upbringing emerged yesterday.

Mr Boles has launched a scathing attack on countryside campaigners accusing them of being ‘hysterical scaremongering latter-day Luddites’.

But the 46-year-old, whose father is a former director general of the National Trust, grew up in a string of idyllic countryside locations.

A close ally of Chancellor George Osborne, Mr Boles has been charged with overhauling planning laws to boost the economy – a move which campaigners fear is a massive threat to the Green Belt.

He has a track record as a radical thinker who wants to slash red tape to boost the economy and refuses to say that the Green Belt is ‘sacrosanct’.

In a speech to the influential Tory Reform Group this year, he attacked a campaign led by the National Trust against the Government’s planning revamp.

Last weekend Mr Osborne raised the prospect that developers could build on Green Belt land, provided other areas of land were designated for protection.

Opponents say Mr Boles has ‘a mission to pave the entire country in concrete from Newcastle to Newquay’.

But his stance on planning is a far cry from his own upbringing where he enjoyed living in some of our most beautiful countryside locations.

The MP’s home in the rural constituency of Grantham and Stamford is a beautiful 19th century cottage which looks out over acres of Lincolnshire fields and woods.

For the past 30 years, his father Sir Jack Boles – head of the National Trust between 1975 and 1983 – and his stepmother Anne have lived in a Grade II listed home in a West Country hamlet.

The imposing two-storey house, which dates back to 1822, looks over fields and lanes of East Devon.

Mr Boles would have enjoyed the 
home’s idyllic setting during his teenage years at fee-paying Winchester
 College and while studying at Magdalen College, Oxford.

As a younger boy, Mr Boles’ family home was in picturesque Englefield, near Reading.

Sir Jack himself enjoys rural life to the full acting as a church warden and beekeeping.

The former National Trust director has refused to comment on his son’s outburst against countryside campaigners.

In a speech to the Tory Reform Group this year, Mr Boles said: ‘Business investment is deterred by the bureaucratic rigidity of our outdated planning regime.

‘So it is essential that we press on with our planning reforms and do not allow the hysterical scaremongering of latter-day Luddites to strangle developments that will boost living standards.’

Mr Boles told BBC2's Newsnight programme that ministers would protect the Green Belt - but warned that large areas of 'open land' may have to be given over for housing

Residents are to lose the right to object to broadband ‘street cabinets’ that have caused dozens of planning rows.

New
 Culture Secretary Maria Miller argued that speeding up the availability
 of ‘superfast’ broadband to all was essential to Britain’s economic 
future.

Under
 her plans, broadband cabinets – typically 5ft high – and other 
infrastructure can be installed without the need for prior approval from
 the local council, except in sites of special scientific interest.

On BBC2’s Newsnight on Thursday, Mr Boles twice refused to say whether he felt the Green Belt was ‘sacrosanct’.

Pressed on the subject by presenter Kirsty Wark, he added: ‘There are currently flexibilities in the regime that many local authorities don’t understand…

'What we are trying to remind them is that in exceptional circumstances they can slightly change the boundaries of their Green Belt.’

Ministers have launched a string of initiatives this week ranging from state guarantees for housebuilding to relaxation on planning requirements for home extensions in an effort to stimulate a flagging economy.

But John Hoad, head of planning for the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: ‘The idea that constant change to the system, more centralist control through Government planning inspectors, or planning holidays on domestic and commercial extensions will help growth is misguided.

‘These are invitations to development with no affordable housing or infrastructure and deeply damaging Green Belt land swaps.’

Nick Boles has paid more than £2,000 to charity following criticism of his decision to take taxpayer-funded lessons in Hebrew

The Hebrew lesson fees he's paying back...

Nick Boles has paid more than £2,000 to charity following criticism of his decision to take taxpayer-funded lessons in Hebrew.

Last month it was revealed that the MP had spent £678.80 on the classes after entering into a civil partnership with Israeli partner Shay Meshulam.

Mr Boles maintained he was ‘entitled’ to learn the language, saying it was a service available to MPs.

He then added with a tone of closure: ‘I’ve done it… and that’s that.’

But the disclosure caused fury in his Lincolnshire constituency and in the pages of his local newspaper, the Grantham Journal.

In a surprise move, Mr Boles has now said he will not claim for any future  classes – and will make a donation to charity to cover the cost of those already taken.

In a column for the paper, he wrote that he had checked with the authorities who regulate the use of the language service and they confirmed his decision to take the lessons was ‘entirely proper’.

He said he worked closely with the British Israel Communications and Research Centre and meets regularly with senior members of the Israeli government when they visit London.

However, he said that he wanted to be ‘frugal with taxpayers’ money’ and ‘recognised’ that some people felt it was wrong for him to use taxpayers’ money to learn a language which would also benefit him personally – even though his partner speaks fluent English.

He said he had decided to make donations totalling £2,115 – ‘the total cost of my Hebrew lessons last year and this to three local charities’. He added he would pay for any future lessons.

Mr Boles met Mr Meshulam on a Conservative Friends of Israel trip.

He is not the first MP to put language lessons on expenses. Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt charged taxpayers over £3,000 to learn Mandarin after marrying a Chinese woman.
