After years of refusing to be drawn on whether he supports Scottish independence or not, Wimbledon champion and Olympic gold medallist Andy Murray appears to have finally taken a side.

The 27-year-old, tweeted in the early hours of Thursday morning: 'Huge day for Scotland today! no campaign negativity last few days totally swayed my view on it. excited to see the outcome. lets do this!'

With the bold statement to his 2.7million followers on the day voting starts, Murray appears to have dropped his carefully guarded neutrality when he's been asked his views on the referendum in the past.

Gold: Murray represented Team GB at the London 2012 Olympics, winning a Gold and Silver medal. He now appears to be in favour of an independent Scotland

'Yes' supporters in Twitter were delighted with the reigning Sports Personality Of The Year's tweet.

One said: 'Bless you Andy. Fellow Scots going for the ace!' while another said: 'All power to @andy_murray - finally out for YES! It's true!' 

No campaigners also weighed in, with one tweeting: 'Disappointed in you andy , you may have just swayed the undecided.'

Murray had reason to be particularly cautious about taking a stance, given the  reaction to his comment about football - 'I’ll support anyone that’s playing England' - eight years ago that is still held against him by some to this day.

Team GB: Murray has an impressive Davis Cup record for Great Britain, winning 19 of his 21 singles matches. His future as a member of Team GB will now be in question

The day after his triumph at SW19 last year Murray declared that he would have to say something on independence but the nearest he has come to publicly expressing a view was in March last year, when he said in an interview with the Times magazine: 'I don't think you should judge the thing on emotion, but on what is best economically for Scotland. 

'You don't want to come to a snap decision and then see the country go tits up.

'I am proud to be Scottish, but I am also proud to be British. I don't think there is any contradiction in that.'

More recently he has pointed out that his view has little relevance because, as a longstanding resident of Surrey, he does not have a vote.

But there have been hints of his thinking, such as criticising Alex Salmond for unfurling a Saltire in Wimbledon's Royal Box last year.

In the past expressed his admiration for staunch 'No' supporter Gordon Brown, and did not give the impression of being a great enthusiast for independence.

His private and professional connections make a nonsense of any suggestions that he is in some way anti-English, and he has never shied from wrapping himself in the Union Jack or made a secret of his pride in representing Great Britain.

It was notable that after London 2012 he declined to appear at the parade of Scottish Olympians in Glasgow but made his own personal visit to his hometown of Dunblane.
