Australian supermodel Robyn Lawley has accused the modelling industry of setting impossible standards for women, and is refusing to be called 'plus size'. 

The 25-year-old beauty said that she has seen too many of her fellow models starving themselves to meet the industry's standards.

‘I’ve seen so many models starve themselves. It’s not up to them, they get told they have to, otherwise they’re fired.’

In an interview with Marie Claire, the 25-year-old beauty revealed the struggle to maintain her weight and the high expectations of the culture of fashion. 

‘When I started modelling, I knew that half the models were about half the size I was’.

‘At first I was totally fine to be labelled as plus size, because I was getting work. But then I realised it was a tool for manipulation’.

‘My body is the national average.’

In an interview with Marie Claire, the 25-year-old beauty revealed the struggle to maintain her weight and the high expectations of the culture of fashion.

Australian supermodel Robyn Lawley has accused the modelling industry of promoting starvation, calling the pressure to be thin 'messed up'.

At 188cm, Lawley was introduced to the modelling world early on, pushed into auditioning for an agency by one of her three sisters.

'When I became a teenager... everyone started suggesting it because I was tall and that's what tall girls do, I suppose,' Lawley said 

Lawley says that the pressure to be thin is 'messed up', revealing that it was hard for her to maintain the expected weight as she was playing sport competitively and enjoyed eating. 

‘I’m a person that loves food,' said Lawley.

'It’s my favourite part of the day.’

'I just see no reason in any labels really, I just want women [to be] happy with their bodies.' 

The Aussie beauty has recently launched a book called Robyn Lawley Eats, as a spin off of her blog of the same name, which features recipes and Lawley's food adventures. 

Lawley was signed last year to brand Mango to front their plus-size range Violetta, but is irritated that the modelling industry labels her and other 'plus sizers' as niche.  

'People say, "How is she a plus-size model?" and I'm like, "Exactly, this is the point, how am I a plus-size model?', Lawley told Clique Magazine.

'There's no size diversity - just none. So there's a whole no-man's land of models who are in between the 'straight size' and the 'plus-size' and they are not working, yet they've got these amazing bodies that are completely in proportion.' 

'I don't think anyone should be called plus-size,' she adds. 'I think it's derogatory to anyone - it's a label.

'I just see no reason in any labels really, I just want women [to be] happy with their bodies,' Lawley said

Unwilling to compromise her health, Lawley quit the industry. It took her many years to realise she could model without harming her physical or emotional health.

'I'm a model; I don't think I need 'plus-size' in front of it.' 

At 188cm, Lawley was introduced to the modelling world early on, pushed into auditioning for an agency by one of her three sisters. 

'When I became a teenager... everyone started suggesting it because I was tall and that's what tall girls do, I suppose,' she said.

'When you first consider the idea of modeling, you automatically think you have to be really skinny,' she said. 

'I was really into fashion, so I knew models were about half the size I was. When I went to see the agencies, my weight was always an issue so I took it upon myself to start losing it.'

After a few years, the size 12 model began to realise the detrimental effect the industry standards were having on not only her, but her friends. 

'I had a moment when I was about 16, one of my Russian model friends was painfully thin and we went to a cafe after a casting. I was trying not to eat at the time, but I was really struggling,' Lawley said.

'I just got a salad [but] she didn't eat anything. I thought it was just so messed up. I was worried about her health.'

Unwilling to compromise her health, Lawley quit the industry. It took her many years to realise she could model without harming her physical or emotional health. 

'It was really hard to have that extra pressure to lose, not just a little amount of weight, but a lot. I had a lot of issues with it,' she said.

'[Many models] get measured when they go into an agency, and if they gain weight, they are out. People don't understand what starvation can do to you, it wreaks havoc with your brain.'

Lawley was the first 'plus size' model for Ralph Lauren, but isn't comfortable with the term, and is passionate about promoting healthy body image among young women. 

'I can see the ramifications on young women if their body is similar or larger than mine and they see a 'plus size' label,’ she recently told Daily Mail Australia.
