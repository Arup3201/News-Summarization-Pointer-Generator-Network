Two parents have been arrested after their five-year-old daughter was pulled from their locked pick-up truck 'sweaty and screaming' as they shopped.

The distraught girl told Albuquerque, New Mexico police that she was locked in the car in the parking lot of a Home Depot on Tuesday as punishment for not eating her food earlier that day.

But her parents, Angelica Lerma-Montoya and Dulces Monge-Perez, insisted they were not aware she had joined them on the shopping trip and were inside the store for more than an hour.

As temperatures soared passed 90 degrees, the little girl tried to escape through the truck's rear-sliding window and her screams alerted passersby who pulled her free and called the police.

She was 'screaming, sweating, unsure and very scared,' one of the passersby, Sheena Mayorga, told KOB-TV.

After the witnesses called cops, the parents didn't come outside of the store for another 45 minutes, they told KOB.

'I hope they don't get the child back, 
they don't deserve the child if they're going to be doing that,' 
another passerby, John Bodenheimer said. 'I mean, they were in the store for over an hour. 
That child could have easily died.'

He added that the windows had not even been cracked open.

Overwhelmed: The girl's father can be seen sobbing inside the truck after the girl was found on Tuesday

Home Depot workers took the panicked child inside the store and gave her water.

When her parents came outside, they were filmed sitting inside the truck and sobbing before they were hailed away by police officers.

The girl, who has not been identified, was taken to hospital to be treated for heat exhaustion and was released to the Children, Youth and Families Department on Tuesday night.

'A tragedy was prevented today,' Albuquerque Police Lt. Eric Jordan said at the scene.

Both parents appeared in court Wednesday, facing felony charges of child abuse with great bodily harm. They remain in jail on $40,000 bond.

One of their daughters, 19-year-old Anna Monge, told KOAT that her parents didn't know the girl was in the truck, explaining that the girl often follows them around without noticing.

The parents also told police that they did not know their daughter had come on the shopping trip.

Monge added that her parents have always taken good care of their six children, who range in age from three months to 19 years.

Four of the children, including the 5-year-old, are in the custody of the Children, Youth and Families Department.
