Cardiff City are unlikely to face any action from the Premier League despite owner Vincent Tan offering his players an illegal £3.7million bonus before Sunday’s defeat by Tottenham.

The Premier League contacted the Welsh club on Tuesday after Sportsmail revealed Tan broke top-flight rules, which state every team must lodge their bonus schedule before the start of the season.

The Malaysian billionaire addressed the players at their Hilton Hotel on London’s Park Lane on Saturday evening and offered the group the bonus to share in the event that they avoid relegation.

However, Sportsmail understands the club are likely avoid a sanction because Tan retracted the offer once he was made aware that it went against the rules.

Under the rules, every club has until the start of the season to register any bonuses not mentioned in players’ contracts with the Premier League to protect the integrity of the game at the highest level.

The regulation is designed to stop clubs using money to motivate players and other staff outside of their existing agreements. Clubs were given a month’s grace this year because of the new TV deals.

Cardiff chairman Mehmet Dalman said: ‘This has all been taken out of context and is a misunderstanding.

‘Yes, Vincent did make the offer on Saturday but he has no executive powers. He's just the owner. He's not running the club and it wasn't up to him to make this offer.

‘I've told him there are strict rules about bonuses and we'd talk further about implementing with the payment structure for next season. Please bear in mind, Vincent Tan meant well on this occasion.’

In the unlikely event that the Premier League do choose to take action, they have a number of options available to them if they  find Tan guilty of an offence, including a fine.

If the matter is deemed serious enough, it can be taken to an independent regulatory commission, where the sanctions - including fines and points deductions - are almost unlimited.

Cardiff's 1-0 defeat at Tottenham on Sunday left 19th in the table.
