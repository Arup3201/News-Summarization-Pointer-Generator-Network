The referee accused of favouring Lionel Messi earlier this tournament will be in charge of Sunday’s World Cup Final.

Italy’s Nicola Rizzoli was slammed by Belgium manager Marc Wilmots after the 1-0 quarter-final defeat by Argentina last weekend.

Wilmots said: ‘I don’t want to be a cry baby, but I noticed the referee never gives fouls against Argentina. Every time something happens with Messi the referee gives him a free-kick.

‘I notice he (Messi) made three fouls and no yellow card, we made one foul and one yellow card.’

It will be the third time this World Cup that Rizzoli has refereed a match involving Argentina — he was also in charge of the South Americans’ 3-2 victory over Nigeria in a Group F clash.

The fact that Argentina has a long history of immigration from Italy only increases the chances of Rizzoli being accused of bias.

Perhaps no one understands the pressure that Rizzoli will be under when he referees football’s biggest match than Howard Webb.

Webb refereed the 2010 final between Spain and Holland in South Africa and was shortlisted for this evening’s clash before Fifa opted for 42-year-old Rizzoli.

And the Yorkshireman said: ‘There is nothing quite like it. The World Cup Final is a match unlike any others. A referee, even a very good one, an experienced once, can do something crazy.’

Prediction: Webb says even the most experienced of referees 'can do something crazy' in a final
