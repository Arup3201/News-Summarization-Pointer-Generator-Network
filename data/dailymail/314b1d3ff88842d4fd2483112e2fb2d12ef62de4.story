A Welsh model is preparing to try and win the same international beauty pageant that her mother competed for 32 years ago. 

Victoria Tooby, 20, beat 71 other competitors to win a heat in the UK for Miss International 2014, while her mother Caroline, 52, looked on with pride.

The former Miss Wales, who now works as an accountant, took part in the same event in 1982 when she was 21 year -old.

The ladies even share the same dress size at the pageants - with Victoria boasting an almost identical size six figure to that her mum had 32 years ago.

After her win at the Palace Hotel in Manchester, Victoria, from Colwyn Bay, North Wales, will be heading to Japan to compete for  Miss International 2014 in November.

When she returns to the UK, she will be heading to university to study law with the aim of eventually becoming a barrister, 

Victoria said: 'It sounds really cheesy but I'm so proud to be able to follow in the footsteps of my mum.

'She competed at the Miss International event when she was younger and to say that I'm about to do the same thing is phenomenal.

'I never in my wildest dreams expected to win the Miss International UK event.

Victoria Tooby won the UK heat of Miss International during an event in July at the Palace Hotel in Manchester 

'I was competing against the best people in the country - I never believed I had a genuine chance of winning.

'During an interval, my mum and dad told me how proud they were of my performance but I didn't think I'd done all that well.

'The next thing I was announced as the winner of the whole thing and I dropped to the floor.

'I started to cry because I was so shocked and overwhelmed - my stomach was doing back flips.

'But when it started to sink in that I'd won I felt absolutely incredible.

'I just hope I can make my parents proud in Japan and it would be amazing if I could win it after my mum came so close all those years ago.'

Although she enjoys competing in pageants, Victoria is keen to show she has brains as well as beauty.

After studying English language, drama, theatre studies and history at Eirias High School in Colwyn Bay, she was granted a place at Oxford Brookes University to study law.

Victoria said: 'I'm about to start a three year course in law at university because I'd love to become a barrister.

'It's completely different to the pageant side of things but it's great to keep my options open for my career.

'Competing at pageants has improved my confidence so much and I'll always enjoy the thrill of being up on stage at events.

'But I've wanted to be a barrister for some time now, so I'll be getting stuck into the books before travelling out to Japan.

'I'm just getting ready for a hectic few months but it's amazing to have two completely different things in my life that I enjoy.

'A lot of preparation went into Miss International UK, I stepped up my workout regime and started eating healthier.

'I practiced walking and also interview techniques and I'm having to do the same now for the Miss International competition.

'I'm definitely making sure I up my game and make the most out of the opportunity I've been given.'

Caroline went on a tour of Japan with her fellow Miss International contestants when they visited the country in  1982 

Mother-of-three Caroline qualified for the Miss International competition in 1982 after being named Miss Wales in Cardiff in the same year.

At the same time, she finished as a runner up at the Miss Europe event in Turkey and the Miss Intercontinental competitions in Colombia. 

Caroline said it would be a dream come true if her daughter claimed the top prize that she narrowly missed out on 32 years ago.

She said: 'Victoria is such a confident person and I was ecstatic when she won Miss International UK this year.

'I actually started to cry - I was that proud of her.

'It's extraordinary to see her getting ready to compete at the same event as I did just over 30 years ago.

'It really would be a dream come true to see her bring the crown back home.

'In some ways the events are exactly the same as they were when I did them.

'I won Miss Wales and was entered straight into Miss International but Victoria had to beat off competition from the whole of the UK before qualifying for the same event.'

'I'd love her to win the competition that I came so close to winning - it really would be a special feeling.

'Whatever happens I'll be incredibly proud of her.'
