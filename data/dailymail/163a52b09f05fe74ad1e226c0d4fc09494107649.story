FIFA's executive committee members have had their annual pay doubled to compensate for bonuses being scrapped, it has emerged.

The 25 ExCo members now receive 200,000 US dollars (£117,000) annually plus generous per diem expenses while they are on FIFA business such as at the World Cup in Brazil.

However FIFA denied a report in the Sunday Times that members can ask to be paid in cash.

FIFA's head of media Delia Fischer told a news conference: 'We have standards in place which are clearly audited and monitored. Everyone working here receives money via bank transfers and it is all audited.'

Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA's new audit and compliance committee, revealed in February that members had agreed to scrap the system where they received bonuses - reportedly 200,000 US dollars (£117,000) each after the 2010 World Cup.

Scala told Bloomberg then: 'FIFA's executive committee is an oversight and decision-making body, they are not responsible for sales. From a governance perspective we don't want to provide a bonus to people overseeing the operations.'

It has now emerged however that to compensate for no longer being paid bonuses, FIFA's remuneration committee has increased the annual pay of ExCo members.

Britain's FIFA vice-president Jim Boyce, who took over the post in 2011, told Press Association Sport: 'My FIFA salary is paid directly from a FIFA account into a UK account bank account and I pay full tax on it.'
