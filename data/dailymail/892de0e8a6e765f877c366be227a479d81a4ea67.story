Shawn Bair, the 22-year-old gunman who shot two women at an Indiana grocery store on Wednesday night, was a serial killer-obsessed loner who had suffered drug problems according to a friend of one of his victims.

The killer's two victims have been named as 20-year-old Krystie Dikes, a supermarket employee who knew Bair, and a 44-year-old shopper called Rachelle Godfread.

Natasha Sellers, 22, a friend of Dikes, told The Elkhart Truth that she believed her friend had known Bair and that he had suffered from problems with drugs.

Shawn Bair, 22, walked into Martin's Super Market in the city of Elkhart, Indiana, on Wednesday night and shot two women before cops killed him

‘I
 did know him. He dated one of my friends in high school. He always 
seemed like a really nice guy,’ she said. ‘I had heard he had a few 
drug problems, but I never would have thought of this.’

According
 to Sellers, Dike had only moved back to Elkhart in November after spending 
the past year living in Muncie. Both were Elkhart Central High School 
graduates.

The son of Bair's second victim, Joe Godfread, posted on 
Facebook on Thursday: 'For those who don’t know, my mom 
was shot and killed last night at a grocery store. R.I.P. Rachelle 
Godfread we love you.'

According to local county court records, Bair had a criminal record and had been convicted of several petty criminal offenses.

The killer's first victim has been named as 20-year-old Krystie Dikes, a supermarket employee who knew Bair

In 2009, he was convicted of possession of a controlled substance, a Class D felony, and misdemeanor marijuana possession, receiving 12 days of jail time altogether and additional suspended jail sentences.

In 2010, he was sentenced for theft, also a Class D felony, receiving an 18-month jail term with 12 of those months suspended. He was also ordered to pay $5.89 in restitution to Martin’s Super Market, although the incident occurred at a different store from where the shootings occurred.

According to court records, Bair was ordered to obtain 'addictions assessment... and follow-up' as part of his sentence in that matter.

He also received an 'order of commitment' and, after a probation violation, another commitment order.

'If the (defendant) becomes involved in the outreach program as directed by Oaklawn as well as attends individual therapy and obtains a primary doctor or nurse practitioner,' the court records said, 90 days jail time in the probation violation would be suspended.

Oaklawn Psychiatric Center is a psychiatric treatment facility based in Goshen, Indiana.

Bair's second victim was a 44-year-old shopper called Rachelle Godfread

Bair's Facebook page gives a clear indication that had an interest in serial killers and scenes of violence. His profile photo is a man holding an axe under another man’s throat as two young girls look on in shock.

His Facebook listings contain quotes about violence and death attributed to notorious serial killers such as Ted Bundy, Richard Ramirez, H.H. Holmes and Gary Ridgeway, as well as several serial killers’ mugshots.

He had also 'liked' pages  
included the National Rifle Association, National Association for Gun 
Rights, Serial Killer Central and God.

Since August 2011, Blair had been relatively quiet on the social media forum, but one of his final comments from just before he stopped posting was: 'I may be going to hell but at least I'm going honest and you know what that's all I've even been you look at me and see this freak I see a God because I embrace my fucked up side.'

Officials visited Elkhart's home on Thursday morning to collect evidence and are looking into his criminal background for clues.  

'He was going to the store with a mission,' said Indiana State Police spokesman Trent Smith.

Martin's supermarket in Elkhart, which was flanked by police and fire officials after a shooting last night claimed three lives, including that of the gunman

Smith said it was a 'huge crime scene' 
and that shots had been fired from one end of the store to the next. The
 victims were found 10 to 12 aisles apart.

Bair is believed to have walked to the store from his home and entered at about 9:30 p.m. on Wednesday.

He then walked around for 30 or so minutes before the first shooting occurred, that of Dikes, at around 10:05 p.m.

Then Bair headed toward another employee and confronted her. She ran and Bair shot in her direction, but the bullet missed.

Meanwhile, the initial call about the incident went into authorities at around 10:07 p.m.

After
 shooting at and missing the Martin's employee, Bair shot a 44-year-old 
woman, a customer in the store and the second fatal victim, Smith said.

Subsequently, Bair located the store manager and held him hostage, apparently, pointing a gun at him and taunting him.

A large knife was also found near Bair's body inside the supermarket

Elkhart police, by that time, arrived on the scene. When Bair saw them, he ran. The manager ran as well, exiting the store.

Shortly thereafter, Elkhart police shot and killed Bair, according to authorities.

No motive has been established so far,
 but officials are looking into a possible connection between Bair and 
one of the victims.

Two police officers, who were on a routine call nearby, were able to quickly respond to the scene, Smith said.

No other people were injured, 
which Sgt. Smith credited to the 
prompt response by the police officers.

He said: 'The
 quick action of the Elkhart City Police Department responding to this 
active shooter undoubtedly saved several lives tonight.'

The Indiana State Police will investigate because the Elkhart Police Department was involved in the shooting, Smith said.

The shooter was pointing his gun at a third person when the officers found him in a store aisle

'We do have a lot of things to look at as far as video surveillance,' Smith said, noting that state and city police were also interviewing witnesses.

Martin's Super Market posted a statement on its Facebook page, saying: 'Thank you to our community for your thoughts and prayers tonight. We will comment further when we can do so responsibly and appropriately.'

Elkhart is in far northern Indiana, just south of the Indiana-Michigan border, and about 15 miles east of South Bend.
