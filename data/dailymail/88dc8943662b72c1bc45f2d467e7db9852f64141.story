For the second time in months, Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu found herself under fire for a campaign ad containing suspect footage.

As The Weekly Standard first reported on Wednesday, Landrieu's latest TV ad contains fake footage of the three-term Senator speaking at a hearing.Â 

'It is against Senate ethics rules to use
 footage that was shot using Senate cameras in campaign ads, so we 
reenacted it,' Landrieu's campaign manager Adam Sullivan told 
FoxNews.com.

One of these things is not like the other: Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu has come under fire this week for taping a reenactment (left) of herself speaking at a U.S. Senate hearing for a TV ad. Senate ethics rules prohibit members from using real footage (right) in campaign ads

In the 60-second TV ad released Tuesday Landrieu's campaign also doctored a quote to make the Louisiana Senator sound more articulate.

'Do you think there are a bunch of fairy godmothers out there that just wish a magic wand. . .' Landrieu said at the real hearing.

In the fake hearing, Landrieu replaces the word 'wish' with the word 'wave.'

The ad also lists a fake news network named Eye on Washington as the source of the video. The original hearing would have aired on American public broadcasting network C-SPAN.

Landrieu's campaign did not respond to Mail Online's request for further comment.

'We're not sure that a United States 
Senator has ever done such a bizarre reenactment of a floor speech or 
committee hearing for a television ad,' National Republican Senatorial 
Committee Communications Director Brad Dayspring said in a statement.

Dayspring went on to say that Mary 
Landrieu should 'appropriately label the footage as a dramatization or a
 reenactment.'

Landrieu has released two campaign ads
 this year, including the spot running on television currently. Both ads
 have drawn the ire of Republicans.

In
 the first ad, Landrieu used real footage taken by Senate staff - a 
violation of Senate ethics rules that Republicans jumped on immediately.
 Landrieu's campaign manager told Nola.com at the time that the error was made by a third party.

'Sen. Landrieu's official office was not involved in the production of this ad,' Sullivan said.

As
 a result of the first incident, Landrieu faked footage of a Senate 
hearing in the ad that dropped Tuesday in order to avoid further ethics 
complaints.

U.S. Sen. Mary Landrieu walks with other female legislators towards a press conference on Capitol Hill April 1, 2014 in Washington, DC. Landrieu's Senate seat is up for reelection in November

Landrieu's seat is a top target for 
Republicans this election cycle. It is currently listed as a 'toss up 
by polling site Real Clear Politics, meaning either Landrieu or a 
Republican could win the seat.

Because of Louisiana's complicated 'jungle primary' electoral rules, all candidates 
vying for the state's Senate seat will be listed on the ballot on November, 4, 2014, Election Day in America. If no candidate wins 
more than 50 percent of the vote, a run-off election will be held on 
December, 6.

Republican Rep. Bill Cassidy is Landrieu's most formidable 
opponent. Recent polling has neither Landrieu nor Cassidy winning 
the election out right. In a head-to-head match-up, Cassidy leads Landrieu by an average of 2.4 points.

This is the second time this year that Mary Landrieu has found herself in the news over campaign ad footage

@highlight

Now, Republicans are calling out Landrieu for using fake footage of her speaking at a Senate hearing

@highlight

The campaign was unable to use real footage of the hearing because it is banned by Senate ethics, so it filmed a reenactment

@highlight

In the reenactment Landrieu doctors a quote used in the original hearing to make herself sound more articulate

@highlight

Earlier
 this year the Republican Party of Louisiana filed a formal ethics 
complaint against Landrieu for using footage from a press conference 
taken by a Senate staffer

@highlight

The GOP argued this was a misuse of government funds for campaign activity
