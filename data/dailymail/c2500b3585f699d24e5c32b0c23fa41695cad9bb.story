The White House has released a report on the youth of today - and named them the Homeland Generation.

The title is eerily reminiscent of the Showtime political thriller series Homeland which documents an unstable world of surveillance and terrorism in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.

No explanation was given for the name, which is said to describe Americans born from 2005 onwards.

And although it was selected by a focus group, White House communications staff have come under fire for adopting the 'creepy' moniker.

'It's really creepy to call people born after 2004 the Homeland Generation and it needs to stop,' wrote one Twitter user, who shared a link to the White House graph.

Another tweeted: 'I just heard the term "Homeland Generation" for the first time in reference to my kids and I found it chilling'.

Others mocked the apparent reference to the TV series.

One said: 'the "homeland gemeration" doesn't make any ense at all, the show didn't start until 2011'.

And another wrote: 'Homeland generation? I'd go Lost or Breaking Bad generation.'

The name was pioneered by the same research company that first decided the Millennial generation ended in 2004, New Strategist Publications.

After holding a competition, the company received overwhelming support from a focus group for Homelanders over iGenerationers and Generation Wii-ers.   

Fear: The characters are dogged by fear surrounding extremism and struggle to fight Middle Eastern powers

Dosed up: Claire Danes's character Carrie is permanently medicated and psychotic in the show

In the hit series, which premiered its fourth series last week, features a character called Carrie who is psychotic and dosed up on medication.

The world is in turmoil following the 9/11 attacks, and the CIA is in a constant struggle against Islamic extremism.

The release of the report, and the phrase 'Homeland generation', comes amid fraught tensions with the Middle East as ISIS continues to sweep through Iraq and beheads its western hostages. 

According to generational theorists William Strauss and Neil Howe - who created the name Millennials - Homelanders 'will be tracked by mobile digital technology, screened by psychological software, and surveilled by entertainment controls that limit their access to anything inappropriate.

'Older Americans will regard them as well-behaved and diligent - yet also as innocent, risk-averse, and emotionally fragile.'

It is a lifestyle, they say, constructed by their parents who want to shield their children from the drug-fueled 'Dazed and Confused' childhood they experienced.
