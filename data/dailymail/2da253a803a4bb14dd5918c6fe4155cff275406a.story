A former UCLA water polo player accused of attacking three women, including a fellow student, has pleaded no contest to single counts of assault and making criminal threats.

City News Service says Hakop Kaplanyan of Glendale was immediately sentenced Thursday to 180 days in jail and five years of probation. He was also ordered to undergo one year of counseling.

As part of a plea agreement, prosecutors dismissed all of the other counts against him, including charges of forcible rape and false imprisonment.

Hakop Kaplanyan pleaded no contest to single counts of assault and making criminal threats after prosecutors in the case against the 20-year-old former UCLA polo player admitted they did not have enough evidence to pursue rape charges

As part of a plea agreement, prosecutors dismissed all of the other counts against him, including charges of forcible rape and false imprisonment

Prosecutors admitted and the judge agreed there was not enough evidence to try the case--no DNA, no corroborating testimony, no witnesses and no physical evidence, reports KABC.

Prosecutors contend that Kaplanyan attacked three women between 2012 and 2013, when he was arrested after a student filed a report with campus police alleging he'd raped her in a campus residence hall.

According to Kaplanyan's attorney George Mgdesyan, the damage has been done.

The star water polo was arrested after a woman reported Kaplanyan to campus police that he had raped her in his dorm room in April 2013

Kaplanyan had been a rising star polo player as a freshman, but as his lawyer said Thursday 'his dreams are quashed'

'This man’s lost a lot,' Mgdesyan told KTLA. 'This is a kid who went to college, it’s a dream to go to UCLA, be a water polo player, and before you know it, his dreams are quashed and he’s kicked out of school and can’t play water polo.'

Kaplanyan is now a student at L.A. Valley College, where he's on the water polo team. 

Mgdesyan called the allegations 'not true' and 'suspect, at best.'

Glory days are over: Kaplanyan now attends L.A. Valley College, where he plays water polo
