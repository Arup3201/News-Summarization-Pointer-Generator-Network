Paul Pogba scored a sensational volley as Juventus beat Napoli 3-1 at the Stadio San Paolo and earned revenge for their Super Cup defeat.

Pogba's goal gave Juventus a first half lead before Miguel Britos equalised shortly after the hour mark. But Napoli's delight didn't last long as Martin Caceres reestablished the visitors' lead just five minutes later and Arturo Vidal added a third late on to seal the victory.

The result takes Juventus three points clear of Roma at the top of the Serie A table while Napoli remain fourth, a point outside of the Champions League places.

Rafa Benitez's side should have taken the lead early in the first half but former Swansea midfielder Jonathan de Guzman somehow managed to miss the target despite being one-on-one with Gianluigi Buffon. 

Juventus struggled to create anything meaningful but in the 29th minute when a moment of brilliance from Pogba swung the tie in their favour. Carlos Tevez and strike partner Fernando Llorente combined well on the edge of the box and when the Argentine's shot ricocheted high into the air Pogba was waiting underneath to volley the ball past Rafael Cabral.

Caceres could have doubled the Old Lady's lead late in the first half after a clever pass from Tevez found him in the box but he squandered the chance, hitting it straight at the Brazilian keeper.

Napoli emerged after the break with a sense of energy and urgency previously absent in the encounter, and dominated play while the champions sat back. 

The equaliser came shortly after the hour mark when Britos volleyed in substitute Dries Mertens' corner.

But it took less than five minutes for Juventus to re-take the lead. An Adrea Pirlo free-kick was met by defender Caceres who guided the ball past Cabral from eight yards out.

Duvan Zapata and Gonzalo Higuain both had chances to equalise late on but it was the visitors who eventually found the net once more.

Arturo Vidal found himself on the end of a ruthless counter attack and the Chilean rifled in a shot from outside the box to seal the victory.
