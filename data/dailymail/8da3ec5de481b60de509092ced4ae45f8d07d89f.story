A donkey is missing her annual nativity show for the first time after being stabbed 12 times by a manic in a night time attack.

Cheeky the donkey, who is 22 years old, was due to star in the Christmas show at Greenmeadow Farm in Cwmbran, South Wales, until she was knifed in the night at her farm by a mystery intruder.

Police are today hunting the cruel attacker who attacked the 22-year-old just days before the nativity show where she would be cheered by children.

Mare Cheeky has been stitched up and will watch the nativity from the wings as she receives treatment for her deep stab wounds.

Workers at the community farm in Cwmbran, South Wales, where Cheeky lives are in shock at the senseless violence.

Manager Elizabeth Burns said: 'It is abhorrent that someone could do this to an innocent animal - especially before the nativity.

'As well as being upset that Cheeky has suffered we are really disturbed.

'Now our focus is on monitoring Cheeky and nursing her back to health.

'It is a shame that we are having to hide Cheeky away while she gets better because her appearance could upset the children who visit the farm at this time of year.

'But the show must go on and all the other animals are performing well without their friend Cheeky.'

Despite sharing a paddock with two other donkeys Cheeky was the only animal injured at Greenmeadow Community Farm.

The farm are working closely with Gwent Police who believe the wounds were deliberately inflicted.

It has now incorporated regular night patrols and the farm has increased their security.

A spokesperson for Gwent Police said: 'We are appealing for information after a donkey was injured.

'The 22 year old donkey, called Cheeky, received 12 puncture wounds to both hind legs, the abdomen and it's neck.

'She has received treatment from the vet, is back at the farm and her condition is being monitored.'

Cheeky has always been the star at the annual nativity show - but this year has been forced to give it a miss
