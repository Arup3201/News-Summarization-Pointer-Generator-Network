David Cameron today claimed Britain had already take tough action on bankers’ bonuses as he faced heavy criticism for his opposition to capping big City payouts.

The Prime Minister was challenged by Ed Miliband over why he was ‘pulling out all the stops to defend the bankers and their bonuses’ from European Commission’s plans for a cap.

But Mr Cameron said he would take no lectures from the Labour leader, who as a key aide to Gordon Brown ‘croupier in the casino when it all went bust’ in the 2008 financial crash.

Brussels wants to prevent bankers being paid more than a year’s salary in bonuses in most cases.

But the UK government fears the rules will drive away talent and restrict growth.

The Bank of England also hit out at the plans today, warning they will fail to rein in excessive pay and will only force up fixed salaries that cannot be clawed back.

George Osborne suffered a humiliating defeat yesterday in his bid to block a Europe-wide cap bonuses yesterday after finding himself outvoted by 26 to one.

Britain has no veto and Mr Osborne was forced to accept a face-saving concession from Germany, Spain and Italy to undertake ‘technical negotiations’ over how the cap will work, in the hope of reaching ‘consensus’.

The defeat is a significant blow to the UK, which had argued a bonus cap would have a disproportionate impact on the City of London.

Clash: The row over banker's bonuses and welfare reforms dominated the session of Prime Minister's Questions

In the Commons today Mr Cameron was challenged by Mr Miliband over his decision to oppose limits on the vast payouts made to City high fliers.

Mr Miliband claimed to have a letter from ‘John the banker’ who was ‘worried’ about his bonus being capped at £2 million.

The Labour leader said negotiations on the EU proposals were led by a Conservative MEP and asked: ‘Why are the Prime Minister and Chancellor the only people who think it's a priority to fight for bigger bonuses for bankers?’

However the Prime Minister said Mr Miliband was ‘completely wrong’ and added: ‘We have some of the toughest rules on bonuses and the toughest rules on transparency of any major financial centre anywhere in the world.’

And he attacked Mr Miliband’s record as a key aide in the Treasury when Gordon Brown was Chancellor, and promised an end to boom and bust.

‘Under this Government bonuses are one quarter of what they were when you were in the Treasury,’ Mr Cameron said.

‘I will take lots of lectures from lots of people, but I don't have to listen to the croupier in a casino when it all went bust.’

London Mayor Boris Johnson today insisted the 26-1 EU vote was not the 'end of the story'.

He told BBC 2's Daily Politics: 'We will go on, we will make 
sure that the negotiations continue, we will try to ameliorate the 
proposals, we will try and make sure that it’s not damaging to the 
interests of London.

'All I would say is if it were to have the effect that they propose, 
then the most it could achieve is not so much to damage the interests of
the greatest financial centre in Europe i.e. London, but to damage the 
interests of all of Europe.'

Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King today also warned the cap will act as a ‘distraction’ to efforts to change the culture of pay within the banking industry, according to Sir Mervyn.

Andrew Bailey, incoming deputy governor at the Bank and chief executive designate of the new Prudential Regulation Authority, added it could set back recent progress made to reduce overall bonus pools, defer awards and introduce clawbacks of past bonuses.

‘My concern is that in setting this limit, it runs the risk of pushing up fixed remuneration - that's cash out of the door and it's much harder to get that back if needed,’ said Mr Bailey.

The row comes days after the annual round of bankers' bonuses showed the culture of big money payouts is alive and well in the City.

HSBC handed million-pound pay packages to more than 200 staff in a year that saw it fined £1.2billion for money laundering.

Stuart Gulliver, who is the UK bank’s chief executive, picked up £7.4million in pay and perks as a reward for bumper profits.  Similar seven-figure payouts went to 78 of his British-based staff.

HSBC’s profits for 2012 hit £13.7billion –  more than ten times the amount it was fined for its US and Mexican operations channelling money for drugs cartels.

State-backed bank Royal Bank of Scotland paid £600million in bonuses, despite slumping to a £5.2billion loss.
