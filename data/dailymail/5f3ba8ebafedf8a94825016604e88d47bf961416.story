The violence in Kiev has taken a new turn as protesters are turning on each other following government plans on amnesty for the demonstrators.

The Ukranian parliament have been discussing a 'Get Out of Jail'-free card, on the premise that demonstrators vacate the government buildings they have occupied during the violent protests in the past weeks.

This saw Svoboda party, which represents more moderate protesters, clashing with members of the more militant Spilna Spravam, as the former tried to get them to vacate the Agriculture Ministry in Kiev today.

The scenes followed an announcement by President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday that Russia would wait until a new government is formed before it considers releasing a crucial £9billion bailout package for Ukraine.

The Russian president's comments indicated that Moscow may renege on its promise to bail out the crisis-hit country if the new government turns out to be staunchly anti-Russian.

‘Let's wait until a new government is formed in Ukraine,’ Putin said in televised remarks to his cabinet. ‘But I ask you not to lose contact with your colleagues even in the current situation.’

Violent demonstrations have raged in the capital of Kiev and across the country since President Viktor Yanukovych pulled out of a key EU deal in favour of closer ties with Moscow and have escalated in response to anti-protesting laws.

Earlier, a Ukranian MP was pictured in a bullet-proof vest during a parliamentary session yesterday as the country’s Prime Minister and cabinet resigned in the wake of recent turbulence.

Opposition deputy Lesya Orobyets wore the flak vest on Tuesday, which saw the resignation of Prime Minister Mykola Azarov and a repelling of the anti-demonstration laws, as a sign of protest against police firing at demonstrators.

Yesterday president Viktor Yanukovych wrote on the parliament’s website that he ‘accepts the resignation of Mykola Azarov and as a consequence the resignation of the entire Ukrainian government.’

Lesya Orobyets is the deputy leader of opposition party Batkivshchya, headed by Yulia Tymoshenko, which is demanding early elections despite Azarov's resignation and the end of the repressive anti-protesting laws.

Today, Ukraine's parliament will vote on a measure offering amnesty to people arrested during the protests that have gripped the country.

However, it has been indicated that the amnesty will with a condition, and will only be offered if demonstrators clear the streets and leave the buildings they have seized.

The condition is likely to get the cold shoulder from protesters, who want to push demands for the president's resignation and early elections.

The wide-spread protests began in late November after President Yanukovych shelved a long-awaited agreement to deepen ties with the European Union, but they have been increasingly gripped by people seeking more radical action, even as moderate opposition leaders have pleaded for the violence to end.

About half of Ukraine's people favoured deeper integration with the EU, according to polls, and many Ukrainians widely resent Russia's long influence over the country.

 In the past week, demonstrators have seized government administration buildings in a score of cities in western Ukraine, where Yanukovych's support is weak and desire for European ties is strong.

A crowd late Saturday besieged a building, throwing fireworks, firebombs and rocks, near the protest tent camp where about 200 police were sheltering.

By early Sunday morning, a corridor was created, allowing police to leave.

It is not known if the amnesty has led to an end of the occupation.

Violent demonstrations have spread across Ukraine since the anti-protesting laws and anti EU moves came into force in November last year
