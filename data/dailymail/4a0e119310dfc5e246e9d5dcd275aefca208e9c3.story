Coffees made with camel milk have gone on sale at a UK coffee shop for the first time today.

Leading coffee house Taylor Street Baristas is selling the camel milk coffees at its store in Bank, central London and they will also be served at its Brighton store on Saturday.

Customers were asked to make a suggested donation of £1 above the standard price of the coffee and all the money raised will go towards the agricultural development charity Farm Africa.

Camel milk, which has a 'clean and palatable' taste similar to semi-skimmed cow's milk, is rich in fatty acids and has around half the fat of cow's milk as well as up to three times the amount of vitamin C. It is also rich in unsaturated fatty acids.

Camelattes, anyone? The Taylor Street Barista coffee shop chain is to start stocking camel milk drinks in support of developmental charity Farm Africa

The idea was dreamed up by Richard Ford, deputy fresh foods editor at trade magazine The Grocer who is raising funds for Farm Africa by running the Brighton Half Marathon on 16 February.

Camel milk It is used in coffees sold throughout the UAE and has been imported into the EU by Emirates Industry for Camel Milk & Products since July last year under the brand name Camelicious.

A number of stalls at farmers markets have sold coffees using camel milk, but this is thought to be the first time a major supplier has sold camel milk drinks.

UK first? Farmers markets have been known to sell camel milk drinks, but it is thought to be the first time  mainstream coffee shop has supplied coffees using camel milk

Pioneers: The coffee shop is the first chain in the UK to start selling camel milk, which is a popular choice in the Middle East and parts of Africa

Richard Ford said: 'When I first approached Camelicious about my fundraising project for Farm Africa, ordering a 'camelatte' in my favourite coffee shop seemed like a dream.  

'Cow, goat and even buffalo milk are all widely available in the UK now and there is no reason why camel milk cannot make it into the mainstream here too.'

EICMP deputy general manager and business development manager Mutasher Al Badry said his organisation hoped to build a strong camel milk industry in the UAE and encourage other camel farming areas to do the same.

'Camel milk has always been known in the Middle East, as well as Eastern Africa, but the accessibility for the wider public has always been limited.'

Healthy: Camel milk is a nutritious alternative to cow's milk

Camel milk, which is said to be closer to human milk than any other milk, has a number of health benefits for those who choose to drink it.

It is rich is vitamins and minerals, especially vitamins B and C, and iron.

The drink also has antibacterial and antiviral properties.

Further, the milk is a rich source of insulin, making it a great treatment option for Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes sufferers.

According to the Camel Milk Association, a month-long study showed that people with Type 1 diabetes who drank almost a pint daily improved their blood glucose levels.Camel milk is also a good source of protein, and can often even be drunk by people with lactose intolerance.Currently, it may not be the most popular milk in the world, but it does offer benefits that cow and goat milks do not - including lower cholesterol levels.Traditionally popular in the Middle East, the milk has become popular in the Netherlands and Belgium in recent years where it is generally sold in organic shops.
