A woman made off with $400 worth of stolen clothing after pepper-spraying a Macy's security guard in the face in a Santa Ana mall.

The suspect was confronted by the Macy's security guard in the Santa Ana Main Place Mall as she tried to leave with her loot at about 9 p.m. on Tuesday, police said.

She turned around and sprayed the officer in the face with pepper spray, and when the officer lowered his hand, she used pepper spray again.Â
