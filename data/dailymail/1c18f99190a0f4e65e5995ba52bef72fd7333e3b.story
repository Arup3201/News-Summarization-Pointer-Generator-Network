Doctors are warning of the dangers Viagra abuse, where the drug is mixed with narcotics such as ecstacy to enhance a feeling of euphoria.

With sales of the drug rising by 25 per cent in the run up to Valentine's day, there are fears that abusing the drug could lead to potentially fatal consequences.

Scientists at the University of New South Wales in Sydney 
have identified a 'sextasy' craze that's gaining popularity on the 
club scene.

Popular: Sales of the drug increase by 25 per cent in the run up to Valentine's day. But there are fears that abusing the drug could lead to potentially fatal consequences

They say that users of ecstasy
 are combining the drug with Viagra in an attempt to amplify its 
'euphoric effects'.

The problem with this is that mixing the two drugs can trigger what's known as 'serotonin syndrome'.

This is a potentially serious drug interaction that occurs 
when too much serotonin builds up in the body, say scientists from the National Drug and Alcohol Research 
Centre in Australia.

Although serotonin is 
often referred to as the 'happy hormone', too much of it can cause 
confusion, disorientation, hallucinations, tremors.

In severe cases 
it can result in seizures, an irregular heart beat or even a coma.

Viagra sales have risen year on year ever since it was first approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for prescription-only sale back in 1998.

But its users are no longer only elderly gentleman wanting to pharmaceutically enhance their performance between the sheets.

Problems: Psychosexual counsellors are reporting treating more young men who have become dependent on Viagra for improve their sexual performance

Used correctly, it's a welcome and safe form of pharmaceutical help

But it's the worrying trend of young men abusing the drug, and in some 
cases combining it with other lethal drugs and narcotics, that has 
health officials concerned about the long term mental health consequences as 
well as the more immediate physical dangers.

Instead, Viagra is now considered a 'party drug' among young men and is often mixed with a 'cocktail' of other drugs such as cocaine and ecstasy which health professionals warn could have long term or even immediately fatal consequences. 

While each combination poses a different health risk, researchers from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles are specifically concerned about the growing trend of combining Viagra with 'poppers' or amyl nitrate.

Both drugs serve to dilate blood vessels and increase blood flow - but combining them results in a sudden drop in blood pressure which can cause a stroke or heart attack.

Talking about this deadly combination Dr. Marilyn K. Volker, Sexologist an Associate Fellow of The American Academy of Clinical Sexologists says:  'Viagra and nitrates are never to be used together,' adding, 'people have died from doing that'.

But as well as the physical health risks, experts are also keen to warn the public of the mental effects too.

Raymond Francis, a psychosexual counsellor on Harley Street, 
 says every month he treats about 15 young men - with an average age of 
32 - who have become dependent on Viagra for improve their sexual 
performance.

This week, prescription requests for erectile dysfunction
treatments have risen by 20 per cent.

As a result, Superdrug is currently dispensing one such
treatment every three minutes.

The pharmacy's Online Doctor saw demand peak at 9.31pm on
Wednesday as Britons took advantage of home delivery of their medication before
Valentine's Day.

Simon Lea, business development manager at Superdrug,
said:  ‘It seems as though this Valentine’s Day weekend is likely to be
our busiest period in the history of the Superdrug Online Doctor service.

‘We anticipate dispensing around one erectile dysfunction
aid every three minutes during our busiest delivery and collection times.

‘We don’t want to just raise awareness of the service, we
also want to encourage more men to get the treatment they might have been too
embarrassed to ask for before.

'This is a problem that matters not just on
Valentine’s Day, but also throughout the other 364 days of the year.’

He said: 
'I think this is just a small sample of the problem. These men don’t 
have any physical problems that would cause erectile difficulties.

'Instead they feel they need it because they are putting too many expectations on themselves.'

Francis,
 like many experts, believes some of his male patients are negatively 
influenced by their exposure to Internet pornography.

Theorising
 that like men who are exposed to pornography early in life who then 
acquire a dependence on pornographic imagery for sexual stimulation, 
young Viagra users may also develop a kind of dependence on this little 
blue pill. 

A theory supported by scientists at the University of Texas at Austin.

They
 took 1,207 sexually active males and examined the erectile function 
characteristics and 'sexual confidence' among recreational users of 
Viagra, prescribed users of Viagra and nonusers of Viagra.

After completing the survey they discovered users of Viagra 'reported lower erectile confidence and lower overall satisfaction compared with nonusers.'

Concluding their results support the 'possibility that recreational erectile dysfunction medication use among healthy young men may lead to psychogenic erectile dysfunction.'
