The reckless owners of a white water rafting firm have been jailed following a campaign by the parents of a  British schoolgirl who drowned after being thrown out of an overcrowded boat.

Tragic Cerys Potter, nine, was on holiday with her family in south-west Turkey when the raft capsized as it was going down rapids.

A court heard Cerys was the ninth holidaymaker to drown in rafting accidents on the Dalaman river.Marmaris Rafting described their river trips as a 'family experience' suitable for children.

Justice: Cerys Potter, who died in a rafting accident, with her mother Julie and brother James September 2008.  The Turkish owners of the rafting company were today jailed for recklessness leading to her death

The firm even sold souvenir £40 DVDs showing dramatic footage of rafters being thrown out of boats as they capsized on rocks.

On July 28, 2010, Cerys, of Llancarfan, near Cardiff, 
was riding in one of their inflatable boats with her brother, aunt, 
uncle and cousins when she tragically died.

The boat should have carried a maximum of eight passengers but had 12 holidaymakers on board.
Cerys and her 12-year-old cousin became trapped between the raft and a rock.

Her cousin was rescued from the river unconscious and spent three days in intensive care.
Cerys's body was found washed-up on rocks more than an hour later.

The schoolgirl's parents Terry and 
Julie Potter campaigned for justice for their daughter and for 
safeguards to prevent further tragedies.

They were dismayed to discover that the day after Cerys's death Maramis rafting appeared to bve operating as normal.

And when Mr Potter  returned to the Dalaman river to gather evidence more than a week 
after Marmaris Rafting had lost its licence, he found it operating 
illegally.

He and his wife were in court as the 
panel of four judges found two owners and two employees of Marmaris 
Rafting guilty of causing death by recklessness.

They were each sentenced to five and half years in prison by the court in Mugla, South West, Turkey.

Terry and Julie Potter fought a tireless campaign to bring those responsible for their daughter's death to justice

Mr Potter
said afterwards: 'We couldn't sit back and know that there were still 
children going on these death traps - and more children were going to 
get killed.

'Nothing can bring back Cerys, but I 
want people to realise the risks that are being taken on that river, and
do all I can to prevent another death.'

'This should put a clear message that
they can't carry on killing British holidaymakers including children 
and just get away with it.

'It is sad that it has taken the 
deaths of nine holidaymakers on this rafting trip to get to this stage 
but we do hope that they get the message now.'

The men, all from Turkey, have 10 days to appeal against their convictions.

For the official investigation at the High Court in Mugla, Terence and 
Julie have orchestrated witness statements and even paid for one witness
to fly to Turkey to present her statement.

In an interview before the beginning of the trial Mr Potter told how his daughter had been thrown from the raft.

Four adults, four children and a 
guide were thrown out of the front of the raft and carried downstream, 
but the four children at the back – Cerys, James, Marcus and a friend 
called James – were washed to a small gap between the rock and the steep
bank.

'The water was extremely deep. Cerys was dragged down by the swell of the water and drowned,' says Terence.

Tourists and guides pulled out the 
three boys. When Marcus was found unconscious, an ambulance was called 
and in the pandemonium that followed, few noticed that Cerys was 
missing.

Terence says: 'James shouted to everyone, 'Where's Cerys?' But one of 
the guides said she had been taken to safety in another raft.'

Julie adds: 'I've only seen James cry once. The night after the accident, he sobbed all night, saying, “I couldn't save her.” '

Only when the party, plus 53 other tourists who had been on other rafts 
along the Dalaman, were taken to base camp, was it clear that Cerys was 
missing.

'The alarm was raised loudest by  a holidaymaker in another of the 
rafts,' Julie says. It was only then – an hour after the raft capsized –
that the guides returned. With the river  levels lowered, they found 
Cerys.

Vale of Glamorgan MP Alun Cairns said the Potter family had been instrumental in ensuring justice for their daughter.

He said: 'I pay tribute to Terry and 
July Potter who have been relentless in their pursuit of this process in
the interests of other holidaymakers.

'The family have channelled their 
energy from such a terrible tragedy to ensure no-one else experiences 
the same kind of incident.

'The scale of the sentence sends a 
strong message that tourist operators cannot get away with their blatant
disregard of health and safety standards.'
