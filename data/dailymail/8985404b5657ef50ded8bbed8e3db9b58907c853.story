Sending people to Mars may be impossible due to an increased radiation risk from cosmic rays, claims a study.

It's thought that a predicted decrease in solar activity will raise the levels of radiation astronauts are subjected to from cosmic rays on a deep space mission.

This will increase the risk of suffering sickness, cancer and more on lengthy trips to the red planet lasting about a year to levels beyond what is considered safe.

A study from the University of New Hampshire suggests missions to Mars (illustrated) might be impossible due to an increased risk of radiation. Research suggests when sun is less active cosmic rays increase. This lowers the amount of time an astronaut can safely stay in space

The research, published in the journal Space Weather, was led by Dr Nathan Schwadron of the University of New Hampshire.

In the research it was found that a 30-year-old astronaut can spend about one year in space before cosmic rays raises the radiation-risk beyond safe exposure limits.

A long-standing puzzle in astrophysics is the source of ultra-high-energy particles from space that hit Earth.

Called cosmic rays, they're up to a billion times more energetic than particles at Cern's Large Hadron Collider.

They strike the atmosphere and cause an enormous shower of other particles, mostly muons, electrons and photons, over a wide area.

Though they were discovered decades ago, cosmic rays at these high energies are very rare, making it difficult to pinpoint where in the universe they originated.

It's thought that some come from supernovas, but it's likely there are other sources of cosmic rays in the universe as well. 

That's just enough time to get to Mars and back.

However, many scientists predict that the sun's activity is weakening, which would mean the number of days a human could spend in space before reaching the limit is less than thought.

In fact, the next solar minimum could decrease the time by 20 per cent – making a mission to Mars much more difficult and possibly life-threatening.

Nasa sets limits on how much radiation it is safe for an astronaut to be exposed to.

In the research it was found that it would take 400 days for a 30-year-old male astronaut to reach the maximum radiation does in the last solar minimum.

For a female, this drops to just 300 days.

More worryingly, if solar activity continues to decrease, then men could be allowed just 320 days in space, and women just 240 days.

This would make a mission to Mars for a man difficult, but for women it would be all but impossible without them succumbing to serious effects of radiation. 

'While these conditions are not necessarily a showstopper for long-duration missions to the moon, an asteroid, or even Mars, galactic cosmic ray radiation in particular remains a significant and worsening factor that limits mission durations,' says Dr Schwadron.

'These data are a fundamental reference for the radiation hazards in near Earth 'geospace' out to Mars and other regions of our sun's vast heliosphere.' 

Cosmic rays originate outside the solar system - possibly in supernovas - and travel through the universe. The solar wind, however, can push back this radiation (shown) and prevent it causing too many harmful effects. It is predicted solar activity will continue to decrease in future, increasing levels of cosmic rays

The sun's activity is known to have a clockwork 11-year cycle, with approximately six to eight-year lulls in activity (solar minimum) followed by two to three-year periods when the sun is more active (solar maximum)

Cosmic rays originate outside the solar system - possibly in supernovas - and travel through the universe. The solar wind, however, can push back this radiation and prevent it causing too many harmful effects.

Yesterday science writer Kate Greene, who took part in a simulated mission to the red planet, argued that the first mission to the red planet should be crewed by only women. 

Last year she took part in a Nasa project called Hi-Seas (Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation), which simulated a long-duration mission to Mars on Earth.

Ms Greene and five other crewmembers - three men and three women in total - spent four months in a dome on Hawaii, only leaving the habitat in mock spacesuits.

She says it was rare for a woman to burn more than 2,000 calories a day, whereas men regularly exceeded 3,000.

Her conclusion is that sending women to Mars would be cheaper and more feasible than one with men.

However, this latest research suggests that such a mission by be limited by the amount of time the crew could stay in deep space before succumbing to harmful effects of radiation exposure. 

But during periods of decreased solar activity, the cosmic radiation levels increase to a point that would be harmful to future space explorers, according to the study.

The sun's activity is known to have a clockwork 11-year cycle, with approximately six to eight-year lulls in activity (solar minimum) followed by two to three-year periods when the sun is more active (solar maximum).

In 2006 the longest solar minimum ever recorded was observed, which brought about the highest intensity of galactic cosmic rays, according to the study.

This created worsening radiation hazards that would potentially threaten deep space astronaut missions.

The high radiation levels seen during the sun's last minimum cycle limits the days astronauts could remain safely in space, even behind special shielding against radiation.

This means that the number of days an astronaut can safely stay in space decreases during a solar minimum.

The data was gathered by the Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (Crater) on Nasa's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO).

At the heart of Crater is material called 'tissue equivalent plastic' - a stand-in for human muscle capable of gauging radiation dosage.

This will mean male astronauts can only stay in space for 320 days

@highlight

And for females this is reduced to just 240 days

@highlight

These would be too short for a mission to Mars, particularly for women

Both would be susceptible to radiation sickness, cancer and more
