Crack-smoking Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has now become a pop culture icon after having a series of action figures made in his image.

A company based in the U.S. called Hero Builders has built dolls in three different styles. The controversial politician comes as 'The Mayor', 'The Talking Mayor' and 'The Thug.'

The Talking Mayor is programmed to say, among other things, 'Yes I have smoked crack cocaine.'

Mr Ford recently declared himself 'the best mayor this city has ever had', as he signed up to run for re-election.

Despite
 all 2013's controversy, Mr Ford defended his record in the Canadian city's
 top job and his spokesman said the overweight politician's chances of 
winning another term were 'excellent.'

Announcing his new campaign slogan: 
'Ford More Years,' he said he was 'itching' to start the grueling 
campaign, which will end at the ballot box on October 27.

Last year, Ford's reputation was left in tatters after he admitted that he smoked crack cocaine.

Following the confession, Mr Ford has 
barely been out of the headlines with a stream of allegations about his 
excessive behavior typically followed by gaffe-prone press conferences 
in which he steadfastly refused to consider stepping down. He even had 
his special privileges removed by the city council.

And he stoically 
stood his ground once again, The National Post reported.

Responding to questions about how the crack scandal may affect his run, Ford told reporters at city hall: 'Let them talk about whatever they want. I'm going to stick to my record. I want to see someone get a union deal like I did, get rid of the taxes like I have.'

He also boasted of his attendance record at council meetings, how he's fulfilled campaign promises and touted his leadership during crises such as the recent ice storm, before promising to debate 'anyone anytime, anywhere,' including someone's backyard.

Councillor Karen Stintz and former councillor David Soknacki have also declared their intentions to run for mayor, while John Tory, Olivia Chow and Councillor Denzil Minnan-Wong are considering it, according to The Post.

The news of Ford's intentions was tweeted by CNN producer Vaughn Sterling.

Ford's spokesman, lawyer Dennis Morris, said in an interview with The Globe And Mail that there was nothing stopping Ford re-running.

Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has admitted to substance abuse but remains determined to hold office

'What reason is there for him to step aside?,' he asked. 'I'm not really sure 
because I don't think there's any precedent that anybody must step 
aside. What if he said, "I overindulged in alcohol?" Is it because 
alcohol's legal, crack cocaine isn't? I don't really know.

'And I think 
he made an excellent decision not to step aside because, as you see, 
he's rehabilitating himself as of the past (several) weeks.'

When
 asked what his chances were he added: 'I think they're excellent. I 
think if you asked me that a few months ago, I'd think otherwise because
 people aren't happy when an individual with substance abuse 
difficulties doesn't acknowledge and do something about them.'

Last month, Ford revealed that he was going to give his wife cold-hard cash for Christmas because 'women love money.'

Ford
 was participating in a regular call-in on a Washington, DC, sports 
radio show when one of the hosts asked him what he plans to get 
Renata for Christmas.

'Just
 money. Women love money. Give them a couple of thousand bucks and 
they're happy. Get some treats on the side obviously for her,' the 
44-year-old conservative said, according to the National Post.Â
