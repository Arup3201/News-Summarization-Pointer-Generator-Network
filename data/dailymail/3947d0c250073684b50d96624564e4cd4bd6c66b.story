Carla and Damian Tapping went through five years of heartache, trying to start a family.

They even went through a round of NHS fertility treatment, but it was unsucessful.

Now, they can finally introduce their new son to the world, and it's all thanks to Asda.

They have had the first 'Asda Baby', Louie, thanks to the supermarket's budget IVF treatment, which is £800 cheaper than similar drugs offered by an independent pharmacy.

The Asda family: Carla and Damian Tapping have had the first 'Asda Baby', Louie, after five years of infertility heartache, including a failed round of NHS fertility treatment

Happy: Carla, 34, and Damian, 41, are among thousands of desperate couples who have bought discount drugs from the chain

Carla, 34, and Damian, 41, are among thousands 
of desperate couples who have bought discount drugs from the chain - in 
an attempt to cut the huge cost of private fertility treatment.

New mother Mrs Tapping, from Bicester, Oxfordshire, said: 'Louie is here thanks to Asda, and a lot of fundraising from our families.'

Infertile
 couples face a postcode lottery for NHS treatment, with most trusts 
allowing only one cycle, while success for 
women under 35 only reach 32.2 per cent.

Mrs Tapping added: 'We started trying for a baby and never thought it would be an issue. We were healthy and had good lifestyles.'

They were given a cycle of IVF on the NHS which required her to take daily injections.

Her eggs were harvested, fertilised and put back, but the 
agonising treatment failed.

They 
could not afford the £6,000 needed for private treatment, so faced a future without children, but their fortunes were turned around after they invested in the cut-price treatment.

Proud Damian said: 'Thanks for Asda's assistance in completing our family.'

Budget: At Asda, one cycle of treatment will cost £1,346.34, compared to £2,151.86 at an independent pharmacy, a saving of £805.52 (file picture)

An Asda spokesman said: 'Infertility continues to be the most common reason for women ages 20-45 to see their GP, after pregnancy itself, and affects 3.5 million people in the UK - the equivalent of one in six couples.

'Yet despite the acknowledgement of infertility as a serious medical condition, other retailers have failed to follow in Asda’s pioneering footsteps - an initiative that can help customers save up to 60 per cent per cycle of IVF treatment by purchasing their drugs from Asda Pharmacy. '

At Asda, one cycle of treatment will cost £1,346.34, compared to £2,151.86 at an independent pharmacy, a saving of £805.52. 

Superdrug will charge £1,686.71 per cycle and Boots, £2,131.89, a whopping 58 per cent more than Asda.
