Dash-camera footage has revealed cops' dramatic high speed chase to catch the killer of 'American Sniper' Chris Kyle - before he surrendered and officers swooped on him.

Prosecutors showed the never-before-seen video to the jury on Thursday in the murder trial of ex-Marine Eddie Ray Routh, who is accused of killing Kyle and his friend, Chad Littlefield, in 2013.

The video shows Routh driving Kyle's truck, which he stole after shooting the men in their backs at a Texas driving range, before speeding away from police officers, who trail him for nine minutes.

Even when a police car slams into the side of the truck in a bid to stop it, Routh continues driving.

Dramatic: Dash-camera video shown in court on Thursday shows Eddie Routh fleeing from cops in a truck he stole from Chris Kyle after shooting him and his friend dead in Texas in 2013

Surrender: Routh eventually stops and surrenders and climbs out of the car with his hands raised

But as he nears Interstate 35E and Interstate 20, he is forced to stop due to a technical difficulty with the truck - and he can be seen emerging from the vehicle with his hands raised.

Six cops immediately swoop on him - with more in pursuit - and he gets on to the ground, where he is handcuffed.

The dramatic footage was shown in the court on Thursday, along with audio from police officers' body cameras. 

His attorney has suggested Routh, who was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, was in a psychotic state and thought Kyle and Littlefield were going to kill him.

Body camera footage also shows police officers pleading with Routh to get out of the truck for 30 minutes before the chase. One officer records Routh sitting in his car, as he speaks to him through the window.

'Is the apocalypse upon us right now?' Routh can be heard saying on the body-cam recording.

The 27-year-old also talked about voodoo, hell, and the apocalypse, and wondered aloud to the cops: 'I don't know if I'm going insane.' 

At different points in the video, Routh made comments including, 'I didn't sleep a wink last night at all,' 'I don't know if I'm going insane,' and, 'Is this about hell walking on earth right now?'

In court, Lt Michael Smith testified that Routh said something to the nature of: 'He had taken a couple souls and he had some more souls to take.'

'Everything's just happening so fast...I don't know if I'm going insane,' he told the police officer.

'That's what we need to figure out,' the officer responded. 'We need to figure out what you're thinking and then see if it's right or wrong.' 

He eventually sped away from officers.

Routh's defense attorney R. Shay Isham argued that his client's ravings served as proof that he was out of touch with reality that night - but prosecutors have argued that the fact he drove away, and had earlier stopped at a Taco Bell drive-thru for two burritos, showed he was of right mind.

As the videos played in court on Thursday, Littlefield's relatives sobbed, while Kyle's widow Taya shook her head, ABC reported.

Routh has pleaded not guilty to the capital murder charges on the basis that he is mentally ill, suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder.

There is not a question over whether or not he shot the men dead - rather, the trial is focused on whether or not he was of fit mind at the time of the murders.

Routh was a small arms technician who served in Iraq and was deployed to earthquake-ravaged Haiti before leaving the Marines in 2010. 

If convicted of capital murder, he faces life in prison without parole.

The case has gained national attention due to 'American Sniper', the movie starring Bradley Cooper and based on Kyle's memoir, was released to critical acclaim.
