Chelsea are currently in cruise control, unbeaten in all competitions so far this season and are six points clear at the top of the Premier League.

Jose Mourinho's side thrashed Schalke 5-0 in the Champions League on Tuesday evening, with a devastating performance which encapsulates everything great about the Blues so far this campaign.

Mourinho was delighted with the sublime, one-touch football displayed at Schalke: 'In this moment, we are very confident. We go step by step with this mentality. The players are very serious. Everything they do with big focus and ambition, but at the same time with this component, which is quite something new in Chelsea football: this happiness, this flair, this beauty.'

Here are the stats that make Chelsea so impressive so far this season...

30 - Goals so far in the Premier League (rank No 1) 

Thanks largely to summer signing Diego Costa, the Blues are not only winning the majority of their games in the Premier League this season, they are free scoring too at an average of 2.5 goals per game. Twelve of the Chelsea squad have shared the goals as Mourinho's side are attacking with ease.

78 - Pass completion percentage in the final third (rank No 1) 

With the flamboyant attacking prowess of the likes of Eden Hazard, Oscar and Cesc Fabregas, Chelsea are able to set up numerous chances in front of goal thanks to their accuracy in the final third of the pitch. No wonder Costa is banging in the goals. 

83 - Tackles won percentage in the league (rank No 1) 

Chelsea are not just an attacking threat, Mourinho as ever has built his side on a solid foundation with outstanding work rate. As a result the Blues are brutal but effective in defence, winning a high percentage of their challenges to then immediately head back out on another attack.

11 - Goals conceded in the league (rank No 2) 

With Chelsea dominating their matches, they've managed to keep goals conceded down on average to just under one a game, second to Southampton. Thibaut Courtois has excelled between the posts for Chelsea so far this season, keeping stalwart Petr Cech on the bench and rejuvenated captain John Terry is organising the almost watertight defence.

53 - Percentage of Premier League shots on target (rank No 1)

Mourinho and his coaching staff have evidently got the squad working on their efficiency in front of goal as the Chelsea squad lead the way with every other shot hitting the target.

22 - Percentage of goals to shots in the league (rank No 1)

Following on from their sharp shooting, Chelsea are reaping the rewards from their accuracy as they are top of the table for their goal conversion rate with a goal coming after every five shots on target.

11 - Top scorer in the Premier League (Diego Costa)

Spain striker Diego Costa signed for £32million in the summer from Atletico Madrid and on current form appears to be fine business by Chelsea. In just 11 league appearances, the brutal forward has been in clinical form by scoring 11 times, which has made up for his lack of goals in the Champions League (0 so far). In all competitions last season, Hazard was top of the charts for the Blues last campaign with 17, and that could be quickly surpassed by Costa.

14 - Goals so far in Champions League group stages (rank No 2)

Only Mourinho's former club Porto have scored more in the Champions League this season than Chelsea and like in domestic matters, the squad are sharing the duties. 

Eight players have found the back of the net for the Blues in the group stages so far, with an average of just under three goals a game in their five group matches as they have cruised to qualification into the last 16.

4 - Fabregas assists so far in the tournament (rank No 1)

Cesc Fabregas has thrived back in London, since joining Chelsea from Barcelona this summer. The Spaniard has provided four assists in the Champions League and a total of 13 across all competitions as he continues to orchestrate the Chelsea attacks. Hazard has three assists so far in the Champions League and was top for the Blues in all competitions with eight last campaign. So it appears Fabregas has been the signing Chelsea have craved, to piece together their wealth of attacking talent.

3 - Goals conceded in the Champions League (rank No 3)

Very much like their domestic form, Chelsea are making sure they keep their opponents quiet and prevent the goals conceded. Having just let in just two goals so far in their five fixtures, the Blues are building a solid platform to feel confident they can attack without any vulnerability if they lose possession. 

0 - Red cards in Europe (rank No 1)

Chelsea aren't the only side to manage no red cards in the group stages so far but it's worth pointing out their success in the Champions League so far has been dealt with composure and stability, which is a facet in their game Mourinho is keen to maintain when the pressure increases in the knockout stages.

106 - Total crosses in the Champions League (rank No 3)

Mourinho's current side are playing with an incredible versatility and once aspect of their play is utilising the wide areas. Chelsea are firing in over 20 crosses a game to pepper the oppositions box, which inevitably has led to chances for their attack.

63 - Percentage of shots on target in the group stages (rank No 1)

Again, Chelsea's shooting efficiency is shining through on the European stage as the west Londoners are making sure their numerous attacks aren't wasted by at least hitting the target more often than not.

58 - Captain leading the way

Chelsea club captain John Terry is known to the fans as 'captain, leader, legend'. Having scored in the Champions League again at Schalke, the former England captain has now accumulated 58 goals for Chelsea which is a staggering statistic for a centre back, who has represented his beloved club over 600 times.
