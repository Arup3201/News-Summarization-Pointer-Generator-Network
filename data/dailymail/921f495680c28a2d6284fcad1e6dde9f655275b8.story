CCTV footage has revealed the shocking moment a father-of-one was left with horrific injuries after a car slammed into his motorbike.

The video shows David Lodge, 50, being hit by an oncoming motorist who veered into his path while driving along a main road in Kirkwhelpington, Northumberland.

As the white car slams into his bike, debris is scattered onto the road while his wife Tracey, who was riding pillion at the time, was flown more than 30m into the air.

David Lodge, 50, was on his motorbike near Kirkwhelpington, Northumberland when a motorist smashed into him.. On the right you can see his wife, Tracey, being propelled into the air after the impact

His bike lay shattered in pieces while he was being treated by paramedics

After the collision last August, Mr Lodge was left with a catalogue of horrific injuries including a broken spine, three fractured ribs, a 
shattered foot, two cracked forearms, a punctured lung, multiple face 
injuries and swelling to the brain.

He was airlifted to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary and placed in an induced coma for more than 17 days, while his family were warned he may not survive.

While he lay fighting for life, his wife received treatment in the same hospital.

Mr Lodge, a taxi driver from Darlington, County Durham, has revealed he watches the terrifying footage captured by a nearby petrol station because he suffered a four-week window of amnesia after the crash.

He said: 'There's nothing in my mind from the village before to four weeks after the accident.

'I watch it so I'm clear in my mind that there's nothing I could have done to stop.

'It's a reminder of what happened - because I have no memory I don't remember the pain or the hurt.

Among the horrific catalogue of injuries suffered by the father-of-one was a broken spine

Pins were also placed in his foot, which was badly fractured as a result of the impact

'They told my family it was an hour-by-hour situation, whether I was going to live and, if I did, whether I was going to be brain damaged or paralysed.'

He added: 'Now I don't really feel any pain - it's like it never happened.'

After receiving extensive treatment, Mr Lodges said he no longer feels any pain

The couple were making their way back from Aberdeen after a weekend visiting their daughter, Angela, 30, a sales manager at Lush, and her husband, Dieter, 29, a teacher.

As they made their way along the A696 in Northumberland, on August 18 last year, Brazilian tourist Rodrigo Arozo Benicio Dos Santos pulled his car in front of their motorbike.

Tracey, 50, was thrown nearly 30m (100ft) through the air and suffered a fractured wrist, a broken leg and foot.

She had to make countless visits to the James Cook Hospital in Middlesbrough after David was transferred nearer to their County Durham home to continue his recovery.

She said: 'After the accident I was in shock. I think my brain just shut off - I don't remember lying on the road. I thought, 'We've been in an accident, we've come out OK'.

'I heard my husband shout, "Get my helmet off", and I thought he must be OK.

'But then we got to hospital and they said he was critical. I'm just so lucky he's alive.'

Just days after the accident, Santos, 35, was fast-tracked through the courts. He was convicted of driving without due care and attention at Newcastle Crown Court in September, where he was given six penalty points and told to pay £1,400 in fines and costs.

The court was told he had been holidaying in the UK and was travelling to Scotland during a tour of the country. He has since been deported.

Mr Lodges added: 'The whole experience has been a nightmare.

'We've been biking for years and it's a major part of our lives but it's like someone has pressed the stop button and we are waiting for it to go again.

'We are both suffering the effects of the crash and have spent the past year coming to terms with what happened.

'As well as the physical pain from our injuries it also makes me sad to think of the rallies and events that we had previously planned to attend with friends on our bikes.'
