Mother of three Michele Wright was soaking up the sun in Crete when police called to break the news. The home she left behind before flying off on her two-week holiday was no more.

All that was left was a large pile of rubble after a gas blast tore apart the £250,000 dormer bungalow.

Firemen believe the explosion could have been caused by a cooker, possibly left on when the family set off ten days ago.

'Sorry, but your house has exploded': Michele Wright was telephoned by police while on holiday in Crete to be told her £250,000 dormer bungalow in Beulah, Cardiganshire, south Wales, had been completely destroyed

Wreckage: Local residents said they heard a loud 'boom like a bomb going off' as the modern detached bungalow was reduced to rubble. Walls were blown out, the roof blown off and solar panels sent flying into the garden

Explosion: A gas tap is thought to have been left on in the property while mother-of-three Mrs Wright was away on holiday. Debris was scattered 100ft down the road

Pile of rubble: Neighbours heard a huge explosion last Saturday evening. Solar panels from the roof can be seen amongst the wreckage

Destruction: The crumpled property lies abandoned after the explosion. Insurers will have to assess the damage before Mrs Wright can recover her possessions

Shock: College lecturer Michele Wright, 49, who was telephoned by police to be told her house had been destroyed in the blast

Last
night Mrs Wright, 49, a photography lecturer, was understood to be 
flying home to confront her appalling fate.

But she will not be able to 
begin the grim task of sifting through the ruins until her insurance 
company has finished assessing the damage.

Residents
in the village of Beulah, Cardiganshire, described the drama of the 
explosion which they said was ‘like a bomb going off’.

Neighbour Geraint Davies said: ‘I was watching television and there was one horrendous bang.

‘I
went outside and it looked like it was snowing – it was the insulation 
coming down from the sky. Then I looked up the road and I could see that
the house next door had disappeared.’

Heating
engineer Mr Davies said the blast sent the front door flying into the 
middle of the road and blew solar panels and shards of glass into a 
nearby field.

Just a few hours after the explosion Mrs Wright, who works
at Trinity St David University, posted a message on Facebook saying: 
‘Apparently my house has just exploded and I am now homeless. 
Seriously.’

But locals said they were grateful that the family were away as anyone who had stayed in the house would have been killed.

Councillor Lyndon Lloyd said: ‘The fortunate thing is that there was no one left in that building when the explosion happened.

‘The bungalow has literally been smashed to smithereens. The force of that explosion must have been quite incredible.’

She added: ‘Everyone is glad to hear there were no injuries. This will be a tragedy for the family.’

And villager Cerys Thomas said her neighbours were stunned by the damage done to the property.

‘The building has been smashed into pieces,’ she said.

‘The house can be rebuilt but it is all their personal items that have been destroyed that will probably hurt the most.’

Destruction: A shirt can be see hanging among the wreckage from the destroyed property in the village of Beulah

Before: The smart detached £250,000 property in the village of Beulah, Ceredigion, Wales, before the huge explosion

Damage: A picture can be seen lying among the debris from the home which will have to be rebuilt

Wreckage: Wood, roof tiles, and insulation from the property have been scattered over a 100ft radius around the property in south Wales

Damage: The garage next to the property and the car outside were not damaged at all - although the £250,000 dormer bungalow was completely destroyed
