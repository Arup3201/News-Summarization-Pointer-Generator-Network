So much for the clash of the No 10s. The widely anticipated duel between Danny Cipriani and Stephen Myler was turned into a no-contest, as Sale’s pack pounded the champions into submission in Salford on Saturday.

England head coach Stuart Lancaster was at the AJ Bell Stadium and he was given plenty of food for thought - but not the main dish that he would have been expecting. 

In the tussle for fly-half places in the national squad, Cipriani played with precision and authority, while Myler was undermined by Northampton’s troubles up front.

This match came down to collective power and the Saints were emphatically out-gunned; bringing their seven-game winning run to a shuddering halt. 

The Sale forwards were dominant in the scrum and caused havoc with their driving mauls, as the visitors were undermined by an absence of specialist locks.

The show of force from the hosts did not begin and end up front. Outstanding winger Will Addison turned the tide back in his side’s favour in the second half with a monster tackle on George Pisi, while Sam Tuitupou repeatedly left wreckage in his wake. 

Calum Clark and his fellow emergency second row Sam Dickinson both served stints in the sin bin as Jim Mallinder’s side strove in vain to repel the onslaught. The Saints could not get into the game until Teimana Harrison’s consolation try.

As the home pack took a firm grip on proceedings, Cipriani was able to unleash his outside runners with clever variety while showcasing his passing and kicking repertoire. As Myler waited in vain for opportunities to make his mark, Sale’s No 10 ran the show expertly —landing two penalties and two conversions despite a strong wind, before going off nine minutes from time with his job done.

Asked about the fly-half sub-plot, ahead of the announcement of a revised England squad next Wednesday, Sale director of rugby Steve Diamond said: ‘Stephen Myler is a top player and Danny Cipriani is a top player. 

'It’s unfair, certainly for Danny, that his selection for England comes down to the performance of the team all the time. They [Northampton] have a better team than us generally but today we got the upper hand and Danny played well.

‘Danny has been playing well all year and if he doesn’t get an opportunity, that is up to the selectors. Based on his performances in the last few months he deserves a shot.’

If he does not earn that shot, Sale are less likely to keep hold of Cipriani, who is out of contract at the end of the season, but Diamond added: ‘If he doesn’t get picked and he goes, we’ll find someone else. That’s the way it happens at Sale.’

The Cheshire club rose to seventh as the pack rumbled over from lineouts to produce tries for Eifion Lewis-Roberts and Dan Braid. Josh Beaumont demonstrated his ball-carrying at No 8, scrum half Chris Cusiter was a constant threat and Addison and Mike Haley troubled the champions with their pace and astute running lines.

Northampton stay top but on this evidence, Dylan Hartley, Courtney Lawes, Christian Day and Samu Manoa cannot come back soon enough. ‘We look at our game and it wasn’t good enough,’ said Mallinder. ‘In the first half, we were pretty poor. There are parts of our game we need to work on. It’s a blip and we’re not happy with it but we’ll live to fight another day.’
