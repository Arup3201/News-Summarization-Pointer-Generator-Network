A woman has revealed how an old flame secretly camped in a tent at the back of her garden until they were able to be together.

When Sue MacLean accepted a Facebook friend request from Alex MacDonald, her former boyfriend of 25 years before, she was intrigued to see if he had changed at all.

Gone was the thick mop of black hair and teenage looks, but she realised her feelings were as strong as ever.

Romance rekindled: Sue MacLean and Alex MacDonald got back in touch last year - 25 years after splitting up in 1986

After he revealed he felt the same way, things then moved so fast he walked out on his wife and ended up living in a tent near her back garden - without her other man knowing.

Now, after their whirlwind reunion last year, the couple have moved into a rented house in Inverness-shire and are planning to get married in Gretna Green once his divorce comes through.

They originally met at an Inverness disco in 1985 when Ms MacLean was 19 and Mr MacDonald was 16, but split after a year because he thought he was too young to settle.

Both got married but Mr MacDonald could not forget his first true love, so he searched for her on Facebook.

Ms MacLean, 47, told the Daily Mirror that Alex's first words to her were 'I've missed you. I've been looking for you for 26 years'.

And even though he was married and Ms MacLean was in a new relationship after getting a divorce, they arranged to meet last year.

Mr MacDonald, 44, drove 160 miles to her home in Banchory, Aberdeenshire, last August and they planned their future together.

They decided that shop manager Ms MacLean would work out her month's notice and then they would run away together.

But Mr MacDonald, unemployed at the time but now a supermarket worker, turned up at her workplace a few days later saying he had walked out of his marital home in Inverness and could not bear to be apart from her any longer.

He brought his tent so he could be near her until they could be properly together and pitched in a wood near her back garden - unbeknown to her partner Stan Bain, 50.

Ms MacLean said: 'Living in a small tent - especially during the cold autumn nights - just to be near me was the most romantic thing anyone has ever done.'

She walked out on Mr Bain three weeks later, leaving a note on the kitchen table saying she was getting back together with her ex.

And the mother-of-two daughters aged 21 and 24 had a bombshell piece of news for Mr MacDonald related to their past.

Ms MacLean revealed that she had discovered she was pregnant six weeks after he left her in 1986 - but had an abortion.

He said: 'I was stunned. Maybe I would have stayed and we could have had a life and a child together.'

Ms McLean's former partner, Mr Bain, has forgiven her for dumping him, although he said it would have been nicer to have been told in person that she was leaving rather than through a note.

However, Mr MacDonald's jilted wife Val, 50, is less upbeat.

She said: '[Ms McLean] stole my husband.

'She may have known him when they were younger, but I was his wife.'
