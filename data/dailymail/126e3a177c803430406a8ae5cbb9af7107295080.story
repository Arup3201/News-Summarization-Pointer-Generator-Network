Twenty-five conservative and Tea Party groups are suing the Internal Revenue Service over claims  the Obama administration unlawfully obstructed 
applications for tax-exempt status because of their political beliefs.

Court papers have also been filed against Attorney General Eric Holder and top IRS officials as part of the action by the American Center for Law and Justice, a
conservative public interest law firm that filed the federal lawsuit on
behalf of the groups.

The center's chief counsel Jay Sekulow said: 'The IRS and the federal government are not going to get away with this unlawful targeting of conservative groups.

'The lawsuit sends a very powerful message to the IRS and the Obama Administration â€“ including the White House: Americans are not going to be bullied and intimidated by our government.'

Jay Sekulow, chief counsel of the 
American Center for Law and Justice, told Fox News host Sean Hannity on 
Tuesday night that he would soon be 'taking a lot of depositions in a 
very big lawsuit' against the IRS on behalf of 25 right-wing groups.

He
revealed on the Hannity show that despite assurances from the Treasury 
Department and the White House that the IRS had stopped subjecting tea 
party groups to special scrutiny in 2012, his office received a letter 
addressed to one of his clients 'on May 6 of this year from the IRS, 
asking for responses to intrusive questions.'

Sekulow added that the inch-thick 
lawsuit, set to be filed Wednesday morning in federal court, will 
include 'a series of letters from Lois Lerner herself' - the embattled 
chief of the IRS's tax-exempt organizations division who was placed on 
administrative leave last week after she refused to testify before 
Congress.

Those letters, he
suggested, would contradict the claim of former Acting IRS Commissioner
Steven Miller that two 'rogue agents' in the agency's Cincinnati, Ohio 
office were behind the politically partisan attacks on conservative 
groups which crested during the 2012 presidential election year.

Jay Sekulow told conservative TV host Sean Hannity that his group would sue the IRS Wednesday morning on behalf of more than two dozen conservative groups that have tax horror stories to tell

CRUELLA DE (TAX) BILL? Lois Lerner refused to resign after she 'took the fifth' before Congress and is now on administrative leave. The extra scrutiny her IRS department gave to conservative groups included at least one letter she personally signed

White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said on May 20 that the IRS 'misconduct had stopped in May of 2012,' but lat least one organization received a lsit of demands from the agency in May 2013

Hannity said he finds the timeline suspicious.

'Lois
Lerner knew about this in June of 2011,'the conservative host said. 
'The audit that was done internally by the IRS was finished in May of 
2012.

Recalling a former 
IRS commissioner's claim during congressional testimony that the IRS was
not playing political favorites, Hannity added that 'we were told by 
Doug Shulman in March of 2012, "No, we aren't doing this."'

Tea party groups held protests in more than a dozen cities on May 21 to draw attention to their unequal treatment by the Internal Revenue Service

Questions still remain about why U.S. Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration J. Russell George conducted only a preliminary 'audit' of the IRS's behavior instead of a full-fledged investigation. Some conservatives see a political motive, even though George has previously served in Republican administrations and under Republican members of Congress

Sekulow insisted that the IRS's approach to dealing with his clients was coordinated 'right out of Washington D.C.'

'That's where it was coming out of. This wasn't some "rogue agents" in Cincinnati.'

He
added that some of the IRS agents his office dealt with in recent years
'were telling people [about] Washington. They were getting supervisory 
approval.'

On Tuesday, Sekulow showed NBC News
a letter to the Ohio Liberty Council, a conservative organization his 
group represents. Dated March 16, 2012, it bears a stamped signature of 
Lois Lerner and included a copy of a previous letter signed by Joseph 
Herr, a lower-level agent.

Both
letters named Herr as the appropriate contact person for responding, 
but Lerner - or at least someone in her office - appears to have handled
the follow-up personally.

Lerner's letter, Sekulow wrote on his organization's blog, was not an isolated missive.

It 'is representative of the other letters that Lerner sent to our clients,' he wrote.

He also showed NBC News the May 6, 2013 letter,
sent to the Tennessee-based Linchpins of Liberty organization. It 
contains 22 questions in 10 parts, including a demand for 'copies of 
course material' for the group's one-on-one mentoring with high school 
and college students.

MailOnline first reported on
that organization's saga with the federal government, including the 
IRS's requirement that Linchpins of Liberty turn over a list of names of
all the students who received mentoring through its programs.
