Flipped vertically on its nose between a house and a stone wall, the driver of this vehicle had to be cut free by firefighters after finding himself in a tight spot when his car left the road.

The miraculous escape in Buckfastleigh, Devon, occurred when the driver lost control and skidded into the narrow gap, requiring firefighters to cut him carefully out of the vehicle.

Pictures of the rescue show firefighters from the local fire station grappling inside the up-ended car in a bid to free him from the front seat.

The driver of the vehicle was freed and then taken to hospital via ambulance. Firefighters later said his seat belt saved him from serious injury

A spokesman for Buckfastleigh fire station said: 'On arrival the crews confirmed that a private vehicle had left the highway, a male casualty was still inside the vehicle and being tended to by paramedics and members of the HART Team.

'Our first priority was to secure the vehicle and eliminate the danger of the vehicle falling onto its side.

'Due to the location of the incident and position of the vehicle, access was hampered and as a result crews cut the check strap and the top of the door with the hydraulic cutters to create some space.

'The door, along with the use of a short extension ladder, T-bar and line was used to make a platform to allow better access.

The driver of the vehicle was later taken to hospital. The spokesman added that it was only because the driver was wearing a seat belt that he was not seriously injured.
