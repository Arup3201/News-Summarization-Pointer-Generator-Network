Nearly 2.5 million people - one in 20 adults - would like to quit Britain this year, according to new research.

Lifestyle benefits are the biggest reason cited for leaving, while others are looking for a lower cost of living, better wages or to take advantage of exchange rates.

And one in six of those set to quit the country  cite the current political climate in Britain.

Nearly 2.5 million Britons would entertain the idea of moving to pastures new this year, research has revealed

America (18 per cent), Australia (17 per cent), France (10 per cent) and Spain (nine per cent) are the most popular destinations. 

A survey of 2,000 people by foreign exchange experts Currencies Direct reveals that one in 20 adults claim to be definitely leaving the country this year, be it temporarily or permanently, with a similar number  actively planning a move if not committed to one.

Phil McHugh, Currencies Direct trading floor manager, said: 'This looks to be the year when a significant minority of Brits take flight abroad in search of a better life. 

'Working overseas is a dream for many, but to make it a reality there are a whole host of costs and headaches that need to first be negotiated.' 

The US is the most popular destination for Britons wanting to emigrate, with 18 per cent choosing there

Work is the most common reason to head overseas (38 per cent), with others looking to study (30 per cent), volunteer (15 per cent) or retire (15 per cent).

A third are heading off in pursuit of a better quality of life, with a quarter looking for the experience of living abroad.

The economic benefits of life overseas also have a strong pull with 29 per cent believing the cost of living will be lower in another country - a factor that is even higher among young people (43 per cent) than retirees (33 per cent).

One in 20 people stated currency as a reason to move abroad, with favourable exchange rates for Brits in some of the key destinations, thanks to a strong performance from the pound over the last six months.

One in seven are expecting a higher wage, while 12 per cent are looking to save whilst overseas and eventually buy a property back in Britain.

Australia is the second most popular destination to emigrate to, with Down Under being a very popular choice with the younger generation

Men are 50 per cent more likely than women to head abroad, while Brits aged 25 to 34 have the greatest wanderlust: the younger generation (15 per cent) being three times more likely than the national average to be moving abroad.

One in five younger Brits heading abroad are looking to move Down Under, while those aged 55 or older are the group least likely to move to Oz. By contrast, retirement hotspot Spain is almost three times more popular with people in their 50s than their younger counterparts.

Young Brits are also twice as likely as the average to want to move to the Middle East - a probable reflection of higher earning potential combined with lifestyle considerations making it a short-term move. 

Lifestyle benefits, a lower cost of living and better wages make Britons consider emigrating

Mr McHugh added: 'Those considering a move overseas should also make sure they do their financial homework properly, particularly with regard to a potential new home's cost of living, exchange rate and tax laws.

'There have been many positive and negative shifts of late, and it's important to be aware of these. For example in January 2014 the pound started the year at 1.65 to the US dollar, compared to the current rate of 1.51. Alternatively, in January 2014 the pound was trading at 1.20 against the euro, compared to 1.28 now.

'The exchange rate of a destination can make a real difference to a move overseas. Someone transferring their life's savings of £50,000 into a Spanish bank account would be €4,000 better off than this time last year, while the same person moving to the US would be nearly $7,000 down.'
