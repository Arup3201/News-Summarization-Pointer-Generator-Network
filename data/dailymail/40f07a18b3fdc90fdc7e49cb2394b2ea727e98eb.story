The full chaotic state of Nick Clegg's flagship free school meals project was exposed last night.

Freedom of Information requests by the Mail and a survey by Labour reveal that schools in a third of areas are still failing to give all their pupils a 'hot and nutritious' meal.

Three months after the £1billion policy was supposed to have been implemented up to 30 per cent of pupils in some parts of the country are refusing the free meals and eating their own packed lunches.

Nearly 300,000 four to seven-year-olds are failing to claim their free meal, with many parents concerned over the quality of lunches at some schools.

Hot issue: Nick Clegg, pictured eating lunch at a primary school, as his flagship free school meal project was branded 'chaotic' 

Figures also show that councils have been forced to raid their budgets for millions of pounds to meet the cost of the project, despite the Lib Dems claiming it was 'fully funded'. Some schools have given up entirely on the idea of providing hot and healthy food at lunchtime.

Labour education spokesman Tristram Hunt said: 'Nick Clegg's 'free' school meals policy is clearly collapsing in chaos amid a litany of his failures to heed warnings and his broken promises to pupils and their parents.

'He announced the policy without doing the maths first and it is families who are paying the price. Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats cannot be trusted.

'It is not acceptable that schools are forced to raid their budgets to pay for a policy that was introduced on a political timetable.'

Mr Clegg secured funding for the free school meals project in exchange for allowing the Tories to fulfil their manifesto commitment to a tax break for married couples.

The Government set itself the target for take-up of 87 per cent but even that level has been achieved only in about 40 per cent of local authorities.

In total 285,490 pupils preferred to take in their own packed lunch, compared to 1.64million who accepted their free meal

In total 285,490 pupils preferred to take in their own packed lunch, compared to 1.64million who accepted their free meal.

Southend in Essex said take-up on school census day in October was 70 per cent while Thurrock said it was 73 per cent.

Doncaster in South Yorkshire, said its best estimate of take-up was 76 per cent.

In Southampton, 78 per cent of eligible pupils took a free meal while in Hampshire take-up was 79.8 per cent. In Lincolnshire it was 79.35 per cent. Take-up in south-eastern England stands at 81.5 per cent and 83 per cent in the east of England and East Midlands.

The Labour survey asked councils whether any schools in their area are failing to deliver a 'hot and nutritious meal' for all pupils at the start of the academic year.

From the 146 local authorities which replied, 46 schools said they could not offer free meals.

Of those, 40 per cent said they expected to be able to do so by the end of this year, 20 per cent said it would be achieved between January and April next year. But 15 per cent said they had no plans to achieve the aim, while 20 per cent said they did not know when they would. One third of councils said they have been forced to use existing funds to pay for the policy because the money from Whitehall did not cover costs.

About £2.5million was spent by 15 councils on kitchens to make up the shortfall in funding.

That includes £137,000 spent by Sheffield council in Mr Clegg's constituency of Hallam.

Some schools have had to have kitchen 'pods' dropped in by crane while others are supplying cold, packed lunches which can be eaten at desks. At one unnamed school in Birmingham children aged four were served just one chicken nugget each.

Pupils were rationed according to their age, city council member Valerie Seabright found, with Year One pupils receiving two nuggets and Year Two pupils only three.

A Government spokesman said: 'We have made £150million available to fund new kitchen and dining facilities where needed.

'The fact is that more than eight out of ten infants are now enjoying a free school meal at lunchtime, giving them a better start to afternoon lessons and a healthy boost for their first years in school.'
