A soldier killed in Afghanistan paid tribute to his pregnant wife, family and friends in a letter he wrote to be read out at his funeral.

Sgt Lee Davidson, 32, of the Light Dragoons, died on September 9 when his armoured vehicle struck a roadside bomb.

But he brought a smile to the faces of his loved ones when his letter was read out, beginning: 'If a vicar is reading this, all I can say is "Whoops, that wasn't supposed to happen".'

'One day we will meet again': The words used by a heavily pregnant Samantha Davidson follows the coffin of her soldier husband

The best father: Samantha, who is due to give birth to their first daughter in November, said her husband was so excited about having their first girl

Hundreds
 of mourners, including Sgt Davidson's heavily pregnant wife Samantha, attended the service at St Nicholas Church in Thorne, near 
Doncaster, South Yorkshire - the same church where the couple wed on August 20 last year.

In his letter, Sgt Davidson paid tribute to his wife, saying: 'Thanks for being my best friend, therapist, mother, wife and lover. I will miss you the most.'

He also made a joke of his entrance music of 'Hallelujah' by Alexandra Burke and asked that his friends 'never forget me and from time-to-time have a pint for me'.

He left messages for his mother, three sisters, nana, his wife and to his sons he said: 'I love you so, so much.'

Samantha, who is due to give birth to

Touching
 tributes from Sgt Davidson's children, including a poignant message 
from his unborn daughter, were laid at the side of his coffin.

The
 couple's deep love was evident throughout the service yesterday as Samantha's message was played out to the ceremony.

She told how he was the best father to their two boys and how he was so excited at the news they were to have a little girl.

She said she had worn the 'biggest smile' when he had proposed to her.

And when they married last year he had told her: 'You are mine now, for life' and she said: 'I loved that.'

She said: 'I met the man of my dreams,
 I knew I would marry this man. I have five-and-a-half years of fun, 
love and memories and I will tell our children all of them.

'One day we will meet again, until then I am not going to let you go. Love you always and forever.'

Reverend David Green, who led the service and also married the couple last year, said: 'There's a mixture of emotions, there is the sadness of saying goodbye but also the good memories his wife and family have of Lee.'

Major John Godfrey, of the Light Dragoons, said: 'He truly was one of the highest-regarded soldiers in the regiment.

'He was an optimist, he always gave his best and was an inspiration to many.Â  It's a terribly sad day.'

More than 500 people lined the streets to watch as Sgt Davidson's coffin, covered in a Union flag topped with his cap and belt, arrive at the church.

Flowers saying 'DADDY' were laid at the side of the coffin with three little cards from each of his children, including his unborn child, attached.

Samantha's flowers said 'I(heart)U' with a card attached that read: 'It's so sad what has happened. I wish you was still here, I love you lots and lots. 'I will never forget you babe, love and kisses, your wife, Sam.'

Locals from Thorne clapped as his body was led away from the church to be taken to nearby Stonegate cemetery where a firing party fired a volley over the grave and a bugler sounded the Last Post.
