A blustering winter storm that dropped nearly 2 feet of snow just north of Boston, shut down major highways in New York and Pennsylvania and forced U.S. airlines to cancel thousands of flights nationwide menaced the Northeast on Friday with howling winds and frigid temperatures.

The brutal weather - which brought plummeting temperatures to some areas that forecasters predicted could see highs just above zero and wind chill readings of minus 10 degrees and colder by early on Friday - dumped 21 inches of snow in Boxford, Massachusetts, by late Thursday and 18 inches in parts of western New York near Rochester. Up to 7 inches fell in New York City by Friday morning.

The snowfall, frigid cold and stiff winds extended the holiday break for some students for a second day while posing the first test for New York City’s new mayor and perhaps the last challenge for Boston’s outgoing one.

U.S. airlines canceled around 4,000 flights because of the snowfall and low visibility. However air travel was gradually resuming with JFK airport reporting that the first flights had now landed and departed on Friday afternoon.

 there will be some shoveling that I will have to do and some sanding,’

because we have three older children at home.'

 snowstorm worked its way east from the Midwest, where it dropped up to a
 foot of snow on Michigan and more than a foot in parts of Illinois,

Chicago airports.
