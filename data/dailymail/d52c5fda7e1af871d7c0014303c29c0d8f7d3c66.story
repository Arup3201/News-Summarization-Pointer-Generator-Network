As 90-year-old Louise Bain took her last breath, Robert, her devoted husband of 72 years, grasped his chest.

Six hours after his beloved wife, he also passed away.

The pair from Louisiana, who died the knot in 1942, both died on December 26 following what their family described as an inseparable relationship.

They moved into assisted living in Alpharetta, Georgia, in 2011 for the final years of their life and would constantly walk around holding hands, according to staff.  

Inseparable: Robert, 92, and Louise Bain, 90, died within hours of each other following a 72-year marriage 

They are survived by one son, two daughters, six grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. 

One of their daughters Charlotte Tallent of McCormick, South Carolina, told the Atlanta Constitution Journal: 'The moment Mom passed, daddy grasped his chest. He knew she was gone.'

They key to their marriage, she added, was that 'Mom stayed true to who she was and never wavered from that. They knew who they were and enjoyed who they were.'  

They met at a Texas church camp in 1940. Robert had taken another girl but ended up going home with Louise. 

Robert worked for the International Paper Company in Bastrop, Louisiana, before enlisting in the Army Air Corps during the Second World War.

Louise worked on the Mississippi base with him as a civilian driving an Army truck.

In 1954 they moved to Rome, Goergia where Robert worked for Georgia Kraft Company, for 31 years, until his retirement in 1985.

Their family described how they would do everything together, including fishing and hunting. 

Grandson Bob Williams said they were a 'perfect match'.

Louise's relatives often described how she would say Robert was the 'best-looking man' and she 'stole his heart'. 

Family friend Ann Spell, who named their daughter after Louise, told the paper: 'They put the other person’s needs in front of their own; they were inspirational.

'He was always a gentleman, he let her go first.'
