Australian police have ‘made contact’ with a young motorist who appeared to be driving along a Melbourne motorway with his legs hanging out of the window.

Police had pleaded with him to come forward after pictures emerged on the internet.

It appeared to show the driver speeding down the Eastern Freeway with his legs protruding from the side window while the vehicle hurtles along in cruise control.

The picture was taken by another motorist.

A rogue P-plater has been photographed hurtling down a Melbourne freeway with both legs outside the driver's window. He has now come forward to police

‘I couldn’t believe what I was seeing,’ said the motorist who took the picture, identifying himself only as Stewart.

‘I thought “If his right foot’s outside the window, how is he accelerating?” Then I saw both feet out of the window and I thought “Bloody hell”.’

The driver, he said, was travelling over the speed limit with a number of other people in the car.

'He looked very young,’ said Stewart. ‘This guy’s a risk to my safety. I don’t want to share the road with people like that.’

However, the photograph has now provoked a debate about if they are really the driver’s legs.

One man has even put the controversy to the test by getting into his own car in his garage and trying to emulate the driver’s position. His verdict: impossible, unless the driver is a contortionist.

The driver appeared to be 'travelling over the speed limit with a number of other people in the car'. But there has been some question over whether it is physically possible for the driver to be in that position

Others joining in the online controversy have turned on the motorist who snapped the picture, saying he appears to have broken the law himself.

First, they said, he would have had to have been speeding to keep up with the other car.

Then he should not have been using his phone to snap the picture while driving.

Police Inspector Bernie Rankin from the Major Collision Investigation Unit said that if they were the man’s legs protruding from the vehicle the incident was no joke.

‘This young man…his behaviour without any further examination is conduct endangering life. That’s a very serious criminal charge,’ he said.
