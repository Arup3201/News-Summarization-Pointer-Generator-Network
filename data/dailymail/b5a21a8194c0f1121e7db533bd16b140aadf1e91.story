Vanna White feared she was fighting to save her teenage son from being brainwashed by a Hare Krishna monk who was after her money, but now it transpires that the pair are exploring a gay relationship together.

The Wheel of Fortune star's son Nicholas, who likes to be called Nikko, has been living with Krishna devotee Jaycee Akinsanya, 34, while both attend the University of Arizona.

Now 19-year-old Nikko has revealed that he's in a serious relationship with the monk from Liberia who is twice his age.

Friends and lovers: Vanna White's son Nikko, left, with Hare Krishna monk Jaycee Akinsanya, whom he has revealed he is in a relationship with

‘Jaycee and I have a special 
relationship,’ Nikko told the National Enquirer. ‘It’s the closest I’ve ever been
with anyone. It’s just spiritual and wonderful and there is chemistry -
and if there’s sex also, so be it. It doesn’t matter!’

He also revealed that Jaycee has already met with both his mom Vanna and his father, the restaurant mogul George Santo Pietro.

Both
Nikko and Jaycee described the meeting as a success, although they 
slept in separate rooms while staying with them in Los Angeles.

Jaycee,
who shares a small house with Nikko in Tucson, described his 
boyfriend's parent as 'wonderful people.' He told the National Enquirer that if 
they asked him to stop seeing their son, he would 'listen to their 
request and leave it to Nikko to decide.’

With their distinctive saffron-colored robes, the International Society for Krishna Consciousness - or Hare Krishnas as they are commonly known - have seen a rapid growth in the movement since it started in the mid-Sixties in New York City.

The belief system is based on Indian scripture and aims to spread the practice of bhakti yoga as devotees dedicate themselves to pleasing the Supreme Lord Krishna.

The community has 400 centers worldwide, 50 schools and 90 restaurants.

The popular nickname comes from the mantra they often chant in groups, which repeats:      'Hare Krishna Hare Krishna' over and over.

The four central principles of the movement are no eating of meat, no illicit sex, no gambling and no intoxication of alcohol, caffeine, tobacco or other recreational drugs.

Nikko is optimistic his parents will be cool with the usual setup.

‘My mom and dad like Jaycee,’ he said. ‘They don’t think he is a demon.'

Nikko described his relationship with Jaycee as 'close' but not 'sexual in the full sense.' He said he remains 'undecided' about this sexual orientation.

'I
have had one girlfriend and never had a real boyfriend. We are just 
happy to be together, loving each other in whatever way possible,’ he said. ‘Gay? It’s possible.’

According to the National Enquirer,
Ms White, who is worth an estimated $40million, has refused to give her
son $1million he has demanded to build a new ashram for Hare 
Krishna followers.

The TV star is said to be terrified about losing her son to the organization. The Hare Krishna movement previously has been accused of brainwashing in a lawsuit for false imprisonment, among other claims.

Sophomore student Nikko reportedly met Mr Akinsanya, who is a freshman at the same university, last year.

After Wheel Of Fortune star Vanna and her ex-husband and Nikko's father George Santo Pietro, refused to give the money, the Enquirer claims that the monk has been trying to cut his teenage housemate off from his family, advising that Nikko 'follow his own path'.

Mr Pietro is a former restaurateur who 
is believed to be worth in excess of $20million. The couple married
in December 1990 and divorced in November 2002.

A showbiz friend of Ms White told the Enquirer: 'This man is clearly targeting Nikko for his family's money.'

Akinsanya, who is originally from the war-torn West African nation of Liberia, often appears on the college campus in his tradition yellow Hare Krishna robe to encourage students to visit his meditation center. 

Akinsanya first lived in New Jersey when
he arrived in the U.S. before moving to Seattle, where the Enquirer 
claims he faced money problems in 2001.

Assuming control: Vanna White is said to be deeply concerned that her son is living with a 34-year-old Hare Krishna monk named Jaycee Akinsanya

He was allegedly evicted in King County, Washington after failing to pay rent and legal fees of around $1,500.

Nikko told the Enquirer that he did not ask his parents for $1million to build an ashram. He added: 'The money I asked for was for my living expenses - food, gas and for living my spiritual life with Jaycee.' 

Nikko's Facebook page is filled with pictures of the pair visiting a Hare Krishna temple and taking a road trip to Canada.

It is also claimed by the Enquirer that Jaycee is taking a break from his monk duties and converted his ashram - traditionally a group spiritual hermitage - into a private home for himself and Nikko.
