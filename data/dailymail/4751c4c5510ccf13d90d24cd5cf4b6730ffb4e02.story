A dead baby has been found entombed in a concrete-filled tub in a family's garage in Missouri.

Prosecutors are now deliberating over whether to bring charges against the family in Pleasant Hill as questions remain over whether the baby was stillborn or died after birth.

The grisly discovery was made when police went to the house at 6pm on Monday following a report of a stolen car. They allegedly found the vehicle parked behind the home.

They then received the father's permission to search the house and found a plastic tub filled with concrete, raising suspicions, Chief Robert Driscoll said. They found the baby's body inside, he said.

'During the course of that investigation,
it led us not only to the stolen auto and to some minor drug 
paraphernalia and drugs, but it also led us to a capsule that we 
believed contained a body of an infant that had possibly been born 
sometime in the first part of October,' Driscoll told Fox4.

An autopsy is being carried out to determine if the baby was alive when he or she was born and authorities said a decision on charges would be made following the autopsy report.

As investigators tried to determine whether a crime had been committed, neighbors said one most certainly had been.

'There's no reason that a baby should be put in placement of concrete in a tub. That's not a proper burial, and that's not what we all stand for,' neighbor Kurt Brent told Fox 4 Kansas City.

Authorities would not say whether the baby was a boy or a girl, and neighbors said the mother had not looked pregnant.

The father, who has not been identified, was briefly detained for questioning but was released. Authorities added that the family is co-operating with the investigation.

In further developments, it emerged that the mother has been in the hospital for several weeks, and that her four other children have been staying with grandparents, authorities said.

Neighbor Rick Gleim told KSHB that the discovery had stunned the quiet neighborhood, but that they had had suspicions that not all was right at the home.

Gleim said there had been many visitors at the house recently but that the the mother hadn't been seen for weeks.

'I'm even scared now to live here, because I'm not going to know what's going on next door,' he said. 'All of a sudden, it's like "wow", and you find all of this stuff going on.'
