Last week the newly refurbished hotel opened its doors for the first time in over five years, after undergoing a multi-million dollar renovation and rebranding from the Ritz Carlton.

Now it has been revealed that the InterContinental Sydney Double Bay is certainly keen to keep the exclusivity previously afforded to the hotel.

And if Sydneysiders are hoping to grab a drink on it's stunning rooftop bar, there's a high price to pay.

The rooftop bar at the newly refurbished InterContinental Double Bay in Sydney will charge patrons $250 just to enter the establishment

It features an infinity pool and cabana setting on the roof of the establishment (pictured is another of the hotel's pools) 

After midday on any given day each patron will have to pay $250 just to step through the doors of the exclusive watering hole, if they are not already a paying guest staying at the hotel.

They are asked to swipe their credit card at reception, where they are given an access card to the rooftop bar. The bill is settled after the meal and the $250 price tag is in place as a minimum spend, rather than a fee on top of the price of any food or drinks consumed.

InterContinental Double Bay confirmed the fee to Daily Mail Australia, and General Manager of the hotel Frederic Brohez told The Daily Telegraph that the space is designed to be luxurious.

'From noon to close, visitors can experience a variety of dining packages such as champagne and caviar or ­select their choice of dishes and beverages from the menu, with personalised service and a minimum spend on dining options,' he said.

Although the fee is implemented as a minimum spend per person, the idea is to keep the bar exclusive

Drinks are available in the rooms for guests at the hotel, but on the roof start at around $14 

Drinks and food at the rooftop abode - which features a cabana setting and a spectacular infinity pool - start around the $14 mark.

The menu ranges from simpler dishes such as salted caramel popcorn and an antipasto board to the signature dish of Osetra caviar - one of the most prized and expensive of its kind. 

In its previous life, the likes of Princess Diana, Madonna, Bill Clinton and Sir Elton John all graced the coveted rooms of what was the Ritz Carlton in Sydney's Double Bay.

The hotel's Stillery gin bar is anticipated to be one of the city's hottest new haunts among celebrities

It was the hotel of choice for the stars in the nineties and the infamous final resting place of INXS frontman Michael Hutchence.

The hotel still boasts 140 rooms, including 15 suites, with most opening out onto private balconies that offer sweeping views of Double Bay.

The pinnacle of the hotel's dining options is Stockroom, headed by executive chef Julien Pouteau and the exclusive Stillery gin bar has also been restored. 

Special opening prices ranged from $390 per night for a classic room to a cool $5,000 for the upmarket Royal Suite.
