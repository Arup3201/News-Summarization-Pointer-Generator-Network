This image of Keith Richards looks so real, it's hard to believe it's not the man himself starring out from that well-weathered face.

But in fact, underneath those bushy eyebrows and wrinkles is the pretty face of Italian portrait painter and makeup artist Lucia Pittalis.

This incredible transformation and others like it were created by 43-year-old Lucia using makeup alone - no prosthetics, no camera tricks, just intricate makeup application.

Behind these faces of Breaking Bad's Walter White lies Italian makeup artist Lucia Pittalis,

The first time Lucia decided to mix her talents as a portrait painter and makeup artist was on Halloween when she transformed herself into Lemmy from Motorhead. 

'My friends went mad for it in my pictures and outside on Halloween night. It was just a bit of fun with friends,' the Italian tells the MailOnline. 

Since then, Lucia has  transformed herself into stars including Iggy Pop, Marlon Brando and Keith Richards - each one as realistic as the next.

Why has she chosen these particular famous faces? 'Because I love them,' she says. 'And I follow their movies and their music.'

Now an avid Instagramer, Lucia studied art for two years before training to become a makeup artist, so this facial art is the magnificent mash-up of those two talents.

Each creation takes around three hours to complete - although some more tricky characters, like Sylvester Stallone, have taken up to five.

'I watch and study the character's photos and videos and try to catch their expression as much as I can while watching myself in the mirror. Then I start with make up,' explains the artist.

Her magic ingredient? An Italian product called IndioColor sticks.

The 43-year-old says when she's been out on the street wearing her makeup disguises the reaction of passers by has been 'extremely funny'.

'Sometimes people are in total amazement,' she adds. 

Feast your eyes on these for some Halloween inspiration.
