AC Milan will re-launch their bid to sign Adel Taarabt from QPR this week as his representatives head for talks over a proposed £3million transfer.

Milan have scheduled talks for Tuesday and are willing to offer £3m plus a percentage sell on clause for any future sale.

The Morocco forward still has a year on his contract but manager Harry Redknapp says Taarabt has not trained ahead of the new season, that the 25-year-old is determined to move and would not be fit enough to play Premier League football were he to stay.

Deal: AC Milan will re-launch their bid to sign the £3m-rated Adel Taarabt from QPR this week

Redknapp said: 'I don't know what's happening with Adel. He hasn't done a day's training since we've been back. He's miles away from being fit to play at the moment.

'I think he's fit to train this week, but I think wants to move. But if he doesn't want to be here then someone's got to pay the money. He's not going to go cheap.'

Milan are also talking to free agent Stephane Mbia, who impressed on loan at Sevilla last season.

Meanwhile, QPR want to bring in four new players and have an interest in Villarreal midfielder Jonathan de Guzman and Marseille winger Morgan Amalfitano although the latter is closer to joining West Ham on a free transfer.

QPR have also made enquiries about Lassana Diarra at Lokomotiv Moscow although his wages could be an issue. The 29-year-old worked well with Redknapp while at Portsmouth, prompting a £19m move to Real Madrid.

Almost a red: Sevilla left back Alberto Moreno is poised to join Liverpool ahead of the new season 

Alberto Moreno may be happy to stay on British soil once Sevilla's UEFA Super Cup final with Real Madrid is over. The Spain left back, who is poised to join Liverpool, was among a worried bunch of Sevilla staff left stranded on the runway as their plane for Cardiff broke down. The plane was ready to take flight before it turned back on the runway citing technical problems. The team eventually took off two hours later than planned.

Moreno is ready to join Liverpool at the end of this week with midfielder Suso expected to go in the opposite direction on loan as part of the deal.

Brighton are interested in signing Liverpool full-back Jack Robinson on loan. The 23-year-old left-back had an eventful spell at Blackpool last season.

Radamel Garcia, the father of Monaco striker Radamel Falcao, says his son has not ruled out leaving the French Ligue 1 side.

Garcia said: 'I don't rule out that my son may leave. All I'm saying is that he currently has a contract with Monaco.'

Monaco, who signed Fulham goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg on a season loan at the weekend, began the season with a defeat.

Falcao scored a penalty against Lorient on Sunday but Monaco still lost at home 2-1 after Ricardo Carvalho was sent off.

Liverpool have enquired about a loan for Falcao but expect the 28-year-old to join Real Madrid.

Liverpool have looked at Lazio striker Keita Balde Diao, the former Barcelona prospect who is valued at £25m, and retain an interest in Wilfried Bony at Swansea and Jay Rodriguez at Southampton, who remains very much on Tottenham's radar.

West Brom, Brighton and Celtic are among the clubs monitoring South Africa midfielder May Mahlangu.

Reports out of Sweden say the Gothenburg player is poised for a move to the UK for a knockdown price of around £500,000.

The 25-year-old is a box to box style midfielder who is considered one of the best in the Swedish league and won the country's Player of the Year in 2012 while playing for Helsingborgs.

Similar in stature to compatriot Steven Pienaar at Everton, Mahlangu has scored four goals in his last eight games including two in the Europa League.

Wigan are in talks over players at Real Murcia after the Spanish club was relegated for failing to address their finances.

Spain's professional league (LFP) has demoted Murcia from the second division to the third tier Segunda B and fined them £144,000 after they failed to meet the competition's financial criteria.

A Murcia delegation led by coach Jose Manuel Aira and accompanied to the LFP headquarters in Madrid by several hundred protesting fans failed to prevent the league from ratifying the sanctions on Thursday.

Miranda de Ebro-based Mirandes, who finished 19th among the 22 second-division sides last season and were relegated, will take Murcia's place, the LFP said in a statement.

Murcia now need to sell and Wigan are among the clubs to have enquired about who is available.

West Ham have made their move for Sunderland striker Connor Wickham.

The 21-year-old had a strong finish to last season and played his part in keeping Sunderland up but there have not been an abundance of clubs moving for him.

Gus Poyet is keen to move the player on as he has shown little inclination to sign a new contract with his current deal running out next summer.

Poyet is keen to convince Fabio Borini of Liverpool to move to the Stadium of Light as he is not blessed with prolific or confident strikers.

Wickham has shown glimpses of what he can do in loan spells at Sheffield Wednesday and Leeds but is still a work in progress. West Ham are offering around £5m and are waiting on Metz striker Diafra Sakho also.

Southampton are keen on Serge Gnabry at Arsenal and retain interest in Nathan Redmond at Norwich. Manager Ronald Koeman is keen to strengthen down the left hand side with a centre back, left back, left winger and a forward still on his wishlist.

They are ready to make an improved offer for Sam Byram at Leeds also to replace Calum Chambers and cover Nathaniel Clyne.

Marcos Rojo of Sporting Lisbon is still a target but his third party ownership is pushing the price up so Sporting make a clearer profit.

Manchester United have not made a move for Juan Cuadrado of Fiorentina. Despite reports out of Spain that they have agreed personal terms, United are still taking stock of what players they need to prioritise. The Colombia star at this stage is not one of them. Barcelona remain favourites while Chelsea, who allowed Marko Marin to join Fiorentina on loan today, have an interest.

United have an admiration for Mats Hummels at Borussia Dortmund but don't expect the Germans to be willing to sell their new captain.

Juventus midfielder Arturo Vidal is a player United know they could sign if they want to but again club sources say they have not made a move for the Chile international.

Ajax defender Daley Blind and Roma's Kevin Strootman are players that Louis van Gaal likes.
