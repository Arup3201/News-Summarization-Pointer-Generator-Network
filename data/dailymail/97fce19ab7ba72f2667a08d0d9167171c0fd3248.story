Michael Caine's son-in-law avoided bankruptcy today after agreeing a settlement with a man he allegedly owed £120,000.

Michael Hall was being sued over a £117,000 loan Russell Teasdale claimed he was owed by the businessman.

Mr Hall, who married the actor's daughter Natasha in 2007, was said to have borrowed the money from Mr Teasdale that same year to help bankroll office building projects in central London.

Six years later Mr Teasdale claimed he was still owed most of the money, with Mr Hall only having repaid £3,200.

Today at Kingston County Court Anna Medvinskaia, for Mr Hall, handed in an agreement - known as a consent order - to Deputy District Judge Parker.

A source said: 'A consent order has been agreed because there's a settlement. The order is an agreement between the two parties involved in the case.

'Settlement agreements need to be followed through - if they are not further action can be taken.

The terms of the settlement itself have not been disclosed and the consent order has not yet been published.

The 30 second hearing was not attended by Mr Hall.

The agreement was reached after lawyers acting for Mr Teasdale had earlier issued a statutory demand, which would have forced Mr Hall to pay up.

This was countered by a set aside application by Mr Hall, in a bid to have proceedings against him halted.

However in the wake of today's consent order both processes have now been stopped.

Ms Medvinskaia and Suhail Nigar, for Mr Teasdale, both refused to comment on the agreement afterwards.

At an earlier hearing Watson Pringle, representing Mr Hall, claimed his client agreed an oral deal with Mr Teasdale which effectively saw the debt waivered.

Mr Pringle said: 'To my mind the only issue that is raised that is new was that he alleges there was an oral discussion about the debt having been assigned.

'He [Mr Hall] says that at some stage in 2012 they decided to stop the insolvent payments and work out the set-off between them.'

However, Mr Nigar countered the claims, saying Mr Teasdale denied the existence of any such agreement and added that his client was 'very upset' by the suggestion that there was.
