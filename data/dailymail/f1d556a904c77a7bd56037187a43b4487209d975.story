The Vatican has said that Pope Francis has not 'abolished sin' despite a left-wing newspaper claiming he had done so through his words and gestures.

In an article in La Repubblica newspaper, Eugenio Scalfari, an atheist columnist, argued that the Pope believed he had eradicated sin because God's love was eternal.

However the Vatican has rubbished the claim, with spokesman Father Federico Lombardi saying: 'Those who really follow the pope daily know how many times he has spoken about sin and our (human) condition as sinners.'

The article was based on a long interview Scalfari had with the Pope earlier in the year, though Scalfari admits that he did not take notes or use a recording device during the conversation.

Instead he said he had reconstructed it from memory, adding a few passages to make the article flow better.

It is not the first time Scalfari, who founded the newspaper in 1976, has fallen foul of senior Catholics.

The Vatican had hosted a script of the conversation on its website, but has now removed sections of it claiming they were 'inaccurate'.

In his first year as pontiff following the resignation of Emeritus Pope Benedict earlier in 2013, Pope Francis has become a much-loved figure throughout the world.

Francis has become one of 2013's most loved personalities after acts of humility - inculcating kissing this sufferer of neurofibramatosis - saw him win Time magazine's Man Of The Year

He won applause after he was photographed kissing the face and head of a man suffering from neurofibromatosis, a disease similar to that suffered by the 'elephant man' which causes growth to form all over his body.

He also washed the feet of convicts in Rome, ate a meal with the city's homeless just before Christmas, and sent handwritten notes to Catholics all over the world asking for his help.

He famously appeared in the first Papal 'selfie' photograph, won Esquire's Best Dressed award for 2013 and was named Time magazine's Man Of The Year.
