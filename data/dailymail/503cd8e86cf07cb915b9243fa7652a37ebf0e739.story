From diseased horses to displaced cattle and family dramas, The Archers has kept listeners captivated for more than six decades with its authentic storylines.

But, while its ‘everyday story of country folk’ in Ambridge is pure fiction, it seems it paints a better picture of rural life than BBC News.

Radio 4’s flagship drama has been singled out as one of the ‘gems’ of the BBC’s rural coverage in an independent review published by the BBC Trust.

A report has found that The Archers paints a better picture of rural life than BBC News. Pictured is the Church of St Mary the Virgin in Hanbury, Worcestershire. It's bells can be heard in the long-running radio serial

The long-running soap is credited with setting ‘a rural pulse twice a day, six days a week on BBC Radio 4’ and playing ‘an important role in reflecting rural events that might be “too slow growing” for mainstream news programmes’.

This is in contrast to wider BBC coverage of rural affairs, which the report labelled ‘squeamish’ and ‘simplistic’, highlighting a lack of reporters with in-depth knowledge of rural issues as a key concern.

The BBC as a whole, while commended for being ‘generally impartial’, was criticised for often painting rural communities as one of two extremes – either a rose tinted-idyll or area of stark deprivation.

Country Life editor Mark Hedges said there is a ‘squeamishness’ about portraying the grittiness of rural life and that this approach did ‘the countryside a real disservice’.

Key problems identified by the report were the lack of coverage of rural issues in national news, the narrow range of voices and opinions heard in reports, a ‘metropolitan bias’ in what stories are covered and an over-simplification of complex rural issues.

BBC News was also accused of having an ‘unintended bias’ when reporting on controversial issues, particularly on the furore surrounding badger culls.

One of the problems identified was the use of images of ‘cute’ and healthy badgers in reports, rather than ones infected with TB, which critics say pushed the audience towards a sympathetic view of the animals.

Julia Marley, a committee member for the Campaign to Protect Rural England, told the review: ‘Badgers – the first thing you see are cute badgers. The argument has already gone. Immediately the impression is formed.’

The Archers was explicitly excluded from the report’s remit because it is not a factual or current affairs programme.

However, Heather Hancock, the review’s author and former senior partner at consulting firm Deloitte, felt the show was so integral to the BBC’s rural offering the she could not complete her work without addressing it.

She said: ‘It proved impossible to ask any audience or stakeholder about the BBC’s rural affairs coverage without discussing the significance of The Archers’.

She identified it, along with BBC One’s Countryfile and Radio Four’s Farming Today, as a key component of the BBC’s efforts to reflect rural issues and found that its audience ‘hold it to be a fair and accurate reflection of farming and rural affairs’.

Stretching back more than 17,000 episodes, it was started by BBC Midlands in 1950 with the aim of entertaining farmers and educating them on how to feed a country still subject to post-war rationing.

It now commands around 5 million listeners a week as it chronicles the bustling farming community.

While it has occasionally courted controversy, dropping 400,000 listeners in 2012, with listeners complaining the show was being ‘sexed up’ and was becoming unrealistic with storylines involving rape, abortion and arson attacks, it has always stayed true to its rural roots.

Alongside the family dramas and human relationships, recent episodes have seen an outbreak of strangles – a respiratory infection that effects horses – at the local stables, a pig farm being threatened with losing its organic status over infringements of feeding guidelines and a herd of cattle being displaced by floods.

It is known for the meticulous research it put into storylines and has archivists to ensure it remains consistent in its approach, both to characters and the land they live on, over the decades.

A spokesman for BBC News said: ‘We take our commitment to the reporting of rural affairs very seriously and welcome the report’s endorsement of our programming and overall impartiality.

'Whilst the report finds overall we do a good job reflecting and reporting rural affairs there are areas where we can do better and we have committed to a range of steps to help improve the coverage further.’
