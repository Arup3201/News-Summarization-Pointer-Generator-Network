Ban: Cllr Stuart Towner, who was sacked from his job at a boarding school for an affair with a 17-year-old pupil, leaves court after being banned for drink driving with his children in the car

A Tory councillor who was sacked from his caretaker job at a top boarding school for an affair with a sixth former has been banned from driving after he was caught twice over the limit with his children in his car.

Magistrates heard how District Councillor Stuart Towner, 38, had been thrown out of the family home by his wife when she found out about the affair.

Days later he was stopped by police with his 10 and 12-year-old children in the passenger seats.

He was handed a 20-month driving ban and 
ordered to pay costs and a £100 fine after he admitted the 
offence at Hastings Magistrates’ Court.

Towner had begun work as a caretaker at St Bede's independent school in Hailsham, East Sussex, in August last year.

The job came with a house and as a 
result the father-of-two moved his family into the school property and 
rented out their own home.

However, his employment at the school 
came to an abrupt end in March this year when his affair with a 
17-year-old sixth form student came to light.

The Conservative was elected to 
Wealden District Council in 2011 and also sits as a member of Hailsham 
Town Council in East Sussex.

But he has only attended two out of the last nine council meetings, and given apologies for his absence on just three occasions.

Council records show the last Wealden District Council meeting Towner attended in his role as councillor was in early March.

Today the school 
confirmed Towner had worked for them and was dismissed for an 'inappropriate relationship'.

As a result of his affair with the 
teenager, the family lost the caretaker's house which came with his job and Towner was made homeless when his wife Shelly threw him out.

Sources said in the days after he went to council officers demanding to be re-homed and went drinking the day after.

Fired: Towner was a caretaker at St Bede's School in Hailsham before he lost his job over an 'inappropriate relationship' with a sixth former

Prosecutor Jeremy King told 
magistrates: 'On May 23 this year at around 8.30pm, police received 
reports of a possible drink-driver in the Eastbourne area, the car being
 a green Volkswagen Polo.

'Officers saw the green Volkswagen 
travelling eastbound on Eastbourne Road, Pevensey Bay. Police followed 
that vehicle which proceeded to turn into Collier Road, where it was 
stopped.

'Officers noted at the time the 
defendant had two children in the car - one in the front and one in the 
back. One was a 10-year-old, and the other a daughter who was 12 years 
old.

'When officers spoke to Mr Towner, they 
noticed his breath smelled of alcohol. The officers then conducted a 
roadside breath test which was failed.

'He was arrested and taken to a police 
station were another breath test gave the reading of 73 micrograms of 
alcohol per 100 millilitres, which of course is more than twice the 
legal limit of 35 micrograms.'

Maxine Buck, defending,
 said her client, who had no previous convictions, had fallen on hard 
times and began drinking heavily after his wife kicked him out.

She added: 'Before 
today, Mr Towner was a man of good character. He appears before you 
having suffered a great deal of bad fortune, which led up to this 
offence occurring.

'He is deeply ashamed. He recognised instantly what he’d done was wrong at the time.'

'He has recently lost his job and his 
wife left him, taking the children. At the time this offence was 
committed, he was about to be evicted from his property.

'As a result of losing his job and the 
deterioration of his relationship, he began to rely on drinking alcohol.
 Unfortunately, it turned in to an addiction and therefore he was 
drinking every day.

'He is deeply ashamed. He recognised instantly what he’d done was wrong at the time.

'He made a woeful decision to take his children in the car when he had been drinking.

'Bearing in mind he was suffering from 
depression and his reliance on alcohol, he just was not able to realise 
how woeful that decision was.'

Ms Buck said a friend was helping Towner
 to 'get back on his feet' and was willing to give him a job with a 
roofing company 'if he gets his act together'.

She added: 'Mr Towner is not in receipt of any benefits, although I’ve advised him he should do that.

'He has been relying on savings. He is 
currently homeless. All he has is some loose change in his pocket and 
that is literally it. He has exhausted all of his savings.

'He is seeing his GP every Monday, dealing with his alcohol problem.

Tragic: The inquest, at Hastings Magistrates' Court, heard she had joined an informal gathering of people for a paddle on Christmas Day morning after reading about it on Facebook

'Prior to this sad turn of events, this was a man who was in employment, was paying taxes and was not a heavy drinker.

'He wants to be given the opportunity to
 demonstrate to his daughter that he can be a responsible father. He is 
fighting to get himself back on the right track and is sorting himself 
out.'

Towner remained expressionless in the dock, wearing a black quilted jacket, red checked shirt and grey jeans, as his sentence was read out.

Magistrate Francesca Nowne said: 'We are going to disqualify you from driving for 20 months. That means 
you will not get your licence back until February 23, 2015.'

Towner was also ordered to pay £85 costs, a £100 fine and a £20 victim surcharge fee.

A spokesman for Bede’s independent school said: 'I can confirm Stuart Towner was employed by the school from August 2012 until March 2013 when he was dismissed for an inappropriate relationship with a sixth form student who is 17 years old.

'We worked closely with the police and social services who advised us that this was not a criminal matter and that we should conduct an internal investigation which subsequently led to Mr Towner’s dismissal.'
