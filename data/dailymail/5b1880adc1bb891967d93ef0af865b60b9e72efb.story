Tottenham will make a final bid for Morgan Schneiderlin before giving up on signing the wantaway Southampton midfielder.

New Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino is determined to take his former player with him from the south coast but after a summer of big name departures Saints are reluctant to let another of their major assets go.

Schneiderlin has claimed that he has a gentleman's agreement with the club to let him go but until now Southampton have held firm - although their resolve could be tested by Spurs' final bid.

Adam Lallana - Liverpool - £23m

Rickie Lambert - Liverpool - £4m

Dejan Lovren - Liverpool - £20m

Luke Shaw - Manchester United - £31.5m

Dani Osvaldo - Inter Milan - loan 

The French international informed his new boss Ronaldo Koeman that he was 'not mentally or physically able' to play for Southampton due to the speculation surrounding his future.

However he has trained all this week and starts for Southampton for the trip to face Liverpool - and two former team-mates in the form of Dejan Lovren and Rickie Lambert - at Anfield.

The £27million-rated central midfielder will hope he can seal a move to North London before the close of the summer transfer window but that will depend on Southampton's response to what will be Spurs' final attempt to secure his signature.
