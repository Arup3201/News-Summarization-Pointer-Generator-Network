Poignant love letters a young soldier sent to his teenage sweetheart from the trenches have been revealed nearly one hundred years after they were written. 

Will O'Brien from Abersychan, regularly wrote to his girlfriend, Rose Nash, expressing his desire to be with her again, his longing for home and the terrible sights he had seen fighting for his country. 

Will was just 16 when he enlisted in 1915 and fought in the 5th Battalion of the Grenadier Guards.

Letters from the front: Will O'Brien enlisted when he was 16 and constantly wrote to the love of his life, Rose Nash from the trenches

Before he was sent to the front, he had been working as a policeman and dating Rose Nash for a year.

In the letters, he poured out his love for Rose and told of his dreams to be reunited with her after the war.

In a one dated 26 September, 1916, he wrote: 'I
 was dreaming of you last night and I thought that we were walking down 
High Street Newport and seen you as plain as ever, and you can guess how 
disappointed I was when I woke up and heard the guns barking away. But I 
hope some day and before long my dream will come true.'

Brave: Will fought in the Battle of the Somme with the 5th Battalion of the Grenadier Guards

Will and Rose wrote hundreds of letters to one another between 1915 and 1917. Will's letters describe his training, then life at the front, and express how much he misses his true love.

A letter sent in 1915 from Caterham, Surrey, where Will was training, read: 'I
 always wanted you from the first time I seen you, on the first morning 
of this year, can you remember... You are the only girl I ever properly 
cared for. In fact Rose I - you.'

In another letter, Will wrote: 'Dear Rose, you were saying in your last letter that you didn't take the slightest notice of any other chaps and I am glad to hear it.

'I
 have been with some girls before I met you and there is as much 
difference between you and them as there is between chalk and cheese.'

Insight: The soldier kept Rose up to date on his training and deployment

Loss: The couple sent one another hundreds of letters until Will died in battle in 1917

He added: 'I only wish you were here so I could give you on of these XX in real.'

In July, the notorious Battle of the Somme began in which Britain suffered 60,000 casualties on the first day.

Will survived as the battle raged on for months and wrote to Rose of the horrors he had witnessed.

On 14th October, 1916, he wrote from a barn in France: 'Well my dear girl, you said that you seen the pictures of the Battle of the Somme.

Discovery: Rose's daughter-in-law Rose found the letters decades after they were written

Found love again: Rose went on to marry policeman John Nash

'It
 must be an interesting picture but you ought to be actually in an 
advance to know what it is really like. Bullets whizzing past you and 
your mates getting hit and dropping. It is a terrible sight and one 
that you can never forget.'

Eventually Will's luck ran out and he died in battle on 4 August, 1917.

After the war, a heartbroken Rose went 
on to marry another policeman from Abersychan, John Nash.

He had known Will and was the man 
who had come to tell her of his death at the front.

Rose never forgot Will and kept his all his letters wrapped up in the bottom drawer of her wardrobe at her home in Abersychan.

Following her death in 1982, they were discovered by her daughter-in-law, Joan Nash, when she was  clearing out the house.

Joan, 80, a retired librarian from New Inn, Pontypool, has now decided to make the letters public.

She said: 'I got to know Will through these letters. When I got to the part when he died, I was crying my eyes out.'

She added that she decided to share them now, more than 30 years after their discovery, because 'it's the 100 years anniversary of World War One and I thought they might be of interest.'
