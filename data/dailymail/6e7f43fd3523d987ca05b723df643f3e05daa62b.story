Anne Reid said that meeting her idol gave her a new found confidence after the death of her husband

The day that changed my life was 3 July 1986, when I went to see American actress and singer Barbara Cook at London's Donmar Warehouse.

For anyone who doesn't know her work, Barbara is a huge star in America and a Tony Award winner.

Last year President Obama made her a Kennedy Center Honoree, a distinction she shares with the likes of Fred Astaire and Meryl Streep. I'd seen her on TV and thought she was amazing, but going to her show that night changed my life in so many ways.

I became an obsessed fan and followed her around for the next 11 years until I finally got to meet her. Any time she was in England I went to see her, and I was so inspired by her singing that I began taking lessons.

She influenced my lifestyle too. After my husband died I'd been a bit nervous about travelling on my own, but because I wanted to see Barbara perform I started to fly to New York.

Then, in 1997, my lovely friend Thelma Barlow, best known as Mavis Riley on Coronation Street, invited me to Anthony Hopkins' New Year's Eve birthday party at the Bombay Brasserie in London.

I couldn't refuse when she told me Barbara would be performing her cabaret act! At last I was introduced to Barbara and got to know her.

The following year I saw her again at the Donmar, and she invited me to New York to see her perform at the Caf√© Carlyle and join in the wonderful party afterwards.

What a glorious trip that was, and Barbara and I have been great friends ever since. She sends presents to my grandchildren and I now go to New York most years to see her.

Through Barbara I've met the most amazing people. For example, one New Year's Day I was invited to her apartment in New York for a dinner party, and she said, 'I've placed you next to Stephen, because I thought you'd like that.' I said, 'Oh lovely, Stephen who?' And she replied, 'Stephen Sondheim, of course!' Can you imagine how thrilled I was!

After meeting, Anne Reid and Babara Cook became lifelong friends

Barbara and I also went to Paris together one year - we went to the opera and wandered round the city linking arms while Barbara told me all about working on Broadway with Robert Preston and Richard Rodgers, and honestly I just thought I'd died and gone to heaven.

And another thing - where I live now is a direct result of knowing Barbara. The photographer Mike Martin, who took all her photographs, became a friend too, and when I was looking for a flat in London he said, 'There's one going in the block next to me.'

The singing lessons I took when I was a fan, but not yet a friend, have also changed my life. I now do my own cabaret act, singing and telling stories about my life.

Barbara gave me some good advice when I started, and a high point for me was singing Bosom Buddies with her on stage at the English National Opera when she came over to do a charity event a few years ago.

So seeing Barbara Cook on stage all those years ago really was absolutely life-changing. Happily she loves Last Tango In Halifax and can't wait for the second series to be televised in the States in June.
