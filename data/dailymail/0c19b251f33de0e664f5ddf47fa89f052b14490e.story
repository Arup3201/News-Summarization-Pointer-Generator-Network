Stock markets staged a rally today after US politicians struck an eleventh hour deal to avoid a catastrophic debt default which had threatened the global economy.

The FTSE 100 Index had earlier plunged into the red as the prospect of the world's largest economy defaulting on its debt edged nearer, but by the close of the session updates from Washington had lifted it 22.5 points to 6571.6.

In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average surged 200 points ahead, a rise of more than 1%. Germany's Dax was also up, although France's Cac 40 failed to climb out of the red by the end of the session.

On currency markets, sterling slipped
 against a resurgent greenback, off one cent to 1.59 US dollars, while 
it was flat against the single currency at 1.18 euros.

There
 had been a darker mood earlier in the day as markets fell amid anxiety 
about a whether a deal could be reached, and after ratings agency Fitch 
warned it could strip America of its prized AAA rating.

Democrats
 and Republicans have been at loggerheads on Capitol Hill as tomorrow's 
deadline approaches. Failure to reach agreement on raising the 
administration's £10.5 trillion debt ceiling would risk a catastrophic 
US default.

But hopes were 
raised as senate leaders from the opposing parties agreed to a plan to 
avert the looming disaster - although it must still go before the 
Republican-controlled House of Representatives to be passed.

Miners
 were among the biggest hit by the uncertainty on London's top tier. 
Fresnillo was down 3% during the session but pared losses as hopeful 
reports emerged from the US and it closed 1.6%, or 15.5p off, at 937.5p.

Meanwhile
 luxury goods group Burberry, which yesterday made the shock 
announcement that chief executive Angela Ahrendts was leaving for Apple,
 fell back earlier in the day to add to the previous session's losses, 
but finished flat at 1464p.

Royal
 Mail lost some of its post-flotation froth, down 3% or 14p to 475p - 
although investors are still enjoying a rise of more than 40% on the 
Government's price tag last week.

Russian policy makers had expressed confidence that US lawmakers would resolve the debt impasse, saying they viewed Treasury bonds as the world's safest investment even in the event of a technical default.

Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told reporters that Russia would not be affected if Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling by tomorrow's deadline because it holds no short-term US government securities.

Ksenia Yudayeva, first deputy chairwoman at the central bank, described the risk of a US default as 'very low'.

'U.S. Treasuries will remain the safest asset in the world even in the event of a US technical default,' she said.

To deal with any market volatility that may arise, the Russian central bank would roll out its standard range of liquidity provision measures, Yudayeva told reporters after she and Siluanov testified before a parliamentary committee.

Russia holds more than two-fifths of its foreign reserves in U.S. Treasuries.

The central bank's total gold and forex holdings are just over $500billion.

Some blue chips also remained under pressure after star fund manager Neil Woodford quit Invesco Perpetual.

Shares
 in firms in which he has built up holdings dropped after the 
announcement, with BAE Systems initially down again today before closing
 up 4.1p to 443.3p on rising hope from Washington. The group has said it
 could be hit by the budget wrangling.

Capita, another Woodford pick, was down 7p to 963.5p.

Engineering
 group IMI was one of the biggest top flight risers after striking a 
deal to sell its drinks dispensing and merchandising business to US 
billionaire investor Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway for 1.1 billion
 US dollars (£688 million).

The group will return £620 million to its shareholders following the sale, which saw shares rise 29p to 1528p.

The
 biggest FTSE 100 risers were Hargreaves Lansdown up 50p to 1090p, IMI 
up 29p to 1528p, Standard Chartered up 28p to 1499.5p and Aviva up 7.2p 
to 435.4p.

The biggest FTSE
 100 fallers were Schroders down 74p to 2568p, Fresnillo down 15.5p to 
937.5p, Glencore Xstrata down 4.8p to 331.2p and SSE down 20p to 1423p.

Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange

World stock markets fluctuated between gains and losses today as a deadline for divided U.S. lawmakers to agree on a higher government borrowing limit drew ever closer.

Unless Congress acts by Thursday, the government will lose its ability to borrow and will be required to meet its obligations by relying on cash in hand and incoming tax receipts.

That could mean the U.S. is unable to repay holders of Treasury bills that mature in coming days, or that it could miss interest payments on longer-dated Treasurys, and would be in default on its debt.

In early European trading, the FTSE 100 was down 0.4 per cent at 6,521.86 and Germany's DAX fell 0.1 per cent to 8,792.94.

France's CAC-40 was 0.7 per cent lower at 4,226.88.

But U.S. stock futures made modest gains, auguring well for trading on Wall Street. Dow futures were up 0.4 per cent at 15,155 and S&P 500 futures also gained 0.4 per cent, to 1,699.30

In Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 rose 0.2 per cent to close at 14,467.14 while Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 0.5 per cent to 23,228.33. China's Shanghai Composite fell 1.8 per cent to 2,193.07. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.1 per cent to 5,262.91.

Stock indexes in Singapore, Malaysia, New Zealand and the Philippines eked out modest gains.

'The market is still relatively calm waiting for the storm to hit tomorrow, when the U.S. will reach its debt ceiling and then default will follow and all hell will break loose,' said Francis Lun, chief economist at GE Oriental Finance Group in Hong Kong.

'Everybody is thinking the inevitable now. It is inevitable that the U.S. will miss an agreement before the deadline,' he said.

On Wall Street yesterday, stocks were flat or down all day but the size of the losses waxed and waned depending on which politician was giving a press conference about the budget impasse.

The market closed with its first loss in a week. Yields on short-term government debt rose sharply as investors worried about the possibility of a default.

In the energy markets, benchmark crude for November delivery was steady at $101.21 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

Oil steady above $101 as US debt deadline nears

The price of oil held above $101 a barrel today as the deadline for U.S. politicians to raise the government debt ceiling - and avoid a potentially catastrophic default - is only hours away.

By early afternoon in Europe, benchmark crude for November delivery was up 3 cents at $101.24 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract fell $1.20 to close at $101.21 on Tuesday.

The price of oil has swung back and forth for two weeks as lawmakers attempt to resolve the impasse.

'The uncertain economic conditions in the U.S. have caused further volatility and nervous trading in the oil market, with investors worrying about a slowdown in the US oil demand,' said a report from Sucden Financial Research in London.

Government agencies including the Energy Information Administration, which keeps track of US crude and fuel supplies, have stopped many services.

The EIA's weekly report on supplies gives an indication about the strength of demand and often pushes the oil price up or down.

Also setting a ceiling over prices were talks on Iran's nuclear programme in Geneva between the Islamic Republic and six major world powers.

A deal would likely end US-led economic sanctions, which have greatly reduced Iran's oil exports over the past couple of years.

'Progress continues to be made and it seems that Iran is proposing a detailed framework rather than philosophical ideas,' said Olivier Jakob of Petromatrix in Switzerland.

Brent crude's December contract, the benchmark used to set prices for international crudes used by many U.S. refineries, was up 10 cents at $109.52 on the ICE Futures exchange in London.
