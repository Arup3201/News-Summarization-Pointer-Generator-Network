Apple has finally been accepted to join America’s oldest and most prestigious stock index, the Dow Jones industrial average.

The company - worth more than $700 billion - will replace telecom giant AT&T on the list with the switch taking effect after trading closes on Wednesday, March 18.

There are only 30 companies listed on the Dow Jones - a price-weighted average of the biggest stocks  - but for a long time Apple was excluded from the pile because its stock price was too high and there was worry it would distort the balance.

However, following Apple's big stock split last summer, this is no longer a problem.

The company increased the number of shares it had to reduce the unit price from around $645  to $91.

Currently the price rests around $130.

With Apple's entry AT&T will leave the Dow Jones.

David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said there was no need to have two big telecom companies in the equation.

Verizon, which has a bigger stock price and larger market value, is in the Dow too. It will step in to lead the sector.

The last big shake-up of the 119-year old Dow came in September, 2013 when Goldman Sachs, Nike and Visa knocked out Alcoa, Bank of America and Hewlett-Packard.

With news of the upcoming changes, Apple's stock rose $2.55, or two per cent, to $128.99 in early trading on Friday. 

AT&T sank 46 cents, or 1.4 per cent, to $33.54. 

Apple holds a market capitalization of about $736 billion, making it the largest publicly traded company in the world. 

AT&T, by contrast, has a market value of $176.5 billion.
