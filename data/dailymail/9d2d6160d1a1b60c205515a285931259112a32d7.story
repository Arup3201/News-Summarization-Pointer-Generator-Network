The family of a 19-year-old woman who was allegedly shot to death by her soldier husband for being bought alcohol by another man has spoken of their anger after the suspect's bail was reduced. 

Skylar Nemetz, 20, reportedly fired at Tarrah 'Danielle' Nemetz in a fit of rage after finding out she had been given liquor by a man while he was training at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington.

The bullet struck the teenager in the back of the head, before passing through her skull and piercing the computer screen she was sitting in front of.

Nemetz, who had no prior criminal record, was arrested and charged with first-degree murder following the shooting at the couple's apartment in Lakewood, Pierce County, on October 16.

He was originally jailed on $1million bail. But this week, his defense attorney, Michael Stewart, filed a motion to reduce the amount to $250,000, according to The News Tribune.

In the motion, Mr Stewart submitted more than 30 letters from the soldier's friends and relatives, in which he was described as a good marine and husband.

Now, Court Commissioner Meagan Foley has agreed to reduce Nemetz’s bail to $350,000, proving the soldier, who denies the murder charge, remains at the military installation until his hearing.

The decision has sparked outrage among the family and friends of Mrs Nemetz, a native of McKinleyville, California, and former cheerleader at McKinleyville High School.

Stash of weapons: Photos posted on Facebook show a number of guns supposedly belonging to both Nemetz and his late wife. Foley ordered the guns be turned over in the event that the suspect posts bail

The victim's second cousin, Brian Shumard, told the newspaper that all of her relatives were 'furious' that Nemetz could be released, saying: 'What’s changed in a week? Forty letters?'  

Mr Shumard's mother, Vera, added: 'Even if it was an accident, she’s not with us anymore, and it’s all due to his actions.'

And one family friend said: 'It just seems crazy that someone who killed somebody like that could be out walking the streets.'

Following the shooting, Nemetz has given multiple accounts of what happened, including telling a neighbor that his wife accidentally shot herself while cleaning the AR15 rifle.

Photos posted on Nemetz's Facebook page show a number of guns supposedly belonging to both him and his late wife. Foley ordered the guns be turned over in the event that Nemetz posts bail.

Nemetz later admitted to investigators  that he had fired at his wife intentionally, but said the magazine was out of the weapon and he believed the chamber was clear, police said.

'Mr Nemetz said he picked up the AR-15, turned the selector switch from safe to fire and possibly shouldered the rifle and pulled the trigger,' deputy prosecutor Jared Ausserer wrote in an affidavit.

'He stated that he did all of this while the rifle was pointed at the back of his wife’s head. He provided no reason why he did this and said that it was a stupid thing to do.'

Together: Following his arrest, Nemetz phoned his aunt from jail and told her: 'I love my wife. I love my wife'

After he allegedly shot Mrs Nemetz, the suspect reportedly put the rifle in the closet and pushed the magazine under the bed, before dumping out a bottle of cinnamon whiskey into the toilet.

He did not call 911. Instead, the authorities were alerted by a neighbor who had heard the gunshot and arrived at the scene, ABC reported.

Following his arrest, Nemetz phoned his aunt from jail and repeatedly told her: 'I love my wife. I love my wife,' according to KOMO.

Base: It is unknown when, or if, Nemetz will post bail. In the event he does, his 'chain of command' at Joint Base Lewis-McChord (pictured) will reportedly take safety measures to ensure he does not leave the base

One of Nemetz's co-workers told police he saw the couple two hours before the shooting, when Nemetz thanked him for bringing over liquor.

The co-worker then said that it was another man who  brought liquor to the home while Nemetz was out, which reportedly made the suspect 'furious and visually upset.' 

It is unknown when, or if, Nemetz will post bail. In the event he does, his 'chain of command' at Joint Base Lewis-McChord will reportedly take safety measures to ensure he does not leave the base.
