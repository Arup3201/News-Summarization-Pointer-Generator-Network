Steven Fletcher says he is all too accustomed to life in the Premier League relegation zone – but Sunderland boss Gus Poyet wants his players to snap from that mindset.

Scotland striker Fletcher suffered the drop with both Burnley and Wolves and has spent much of his two years at the Stadium of Light in the bottom three.

That is again where they reside heading into Monday’s televised trip to Crystal Palace, and Fletcher admits he isn’t fazed by their position.

Gus Poyet, Sunderland manager, wants to rid his team of their relegation mentality

‘The clubs I have been at, I'm used to it,’ said Sunderland’s two-goal top scorer.

‘The ups and downs, I am used to that kind of thing with being at Burnley and being at Wolves, so I kind of just take each day as it comes.

‘But there are only a few players who can say they have been used to winning ways - I'd say that's Sheasy (John O’Shea) and Wes (Brown), maybe Adam Johnson at some stage at Man City.

‘But if we can put a good run together, we should move out. We know we have got the ability to stay in this league, the players we have got, you see it in training every day, some of the performances from the lads.

‘But we just need to do it as a team and do it on a Saturday, or on a Monday. Obviously if we could be safe before we were last year, it would be a bit better, but we know we have got the team to get through a bad situation, like we showed last year.’

Poyet, though, fears there is a lingering mentality of acceptance at the club.

‘It is a problem that we have been there for four years, fighting for that,’ he said.

‘It is my challenge to change that - to not have the feeling at this football club or the city that we are going to be always fighting down there.’

Fletcher, meanwhile, started the season out of the side but won over his manager to emerge as first-choice striker.

And the 27-year-old insists he never lost faith in his own ability.

‘I wasn't really missing loads of chances – if I was starting to miss chances, then I would start questioning myself, but I wasn't,’ he said.

‘Maybe I wasn't getting into the positions that I was before, I don't know, but I wasn't missing chances, so that didn't affect me.

‘But I feel back to the way I did when I signed for Sunderland. I feel sharp again and able to move again, because there were points last season where I just felt I couldn't even get into second gear, so it was hard. But I feel good now.’

Fletcher and Poyet would feel a whole lot better were a win at Selhurst Park to lift them from the bottom three.
