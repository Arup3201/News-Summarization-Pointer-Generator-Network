A DNA test has revealed Scott Disick is the father of Kourtney Kardashian's son Mason, dismissing a male model's claims of paternity.

The 33-year-old reality TV star was asked by model Michael Girgenti to allow Mason, three, to undergo the test, after he claimed they slept together while she and Scott, 30, were on a break in their relationship in March 2009.

But lab results from tests taken on August 12 have proved his allegations are false.

Kourtney, who has always denied Michael's
allegations, told E! News: 'After three-and-a-half years of lies being 
spread by an individual I met briefly at a photo shoot, I am setting the
record straight that Scott is Mason's father. 

'While it saddens me to 
have to address these ridiculous lies - especially when the truth was 
never in doubt - this story must be put to rest.'

However, Mr Girgenti appeared to not have accepted the results of the text as conclusive and plans to press ahead with the paternity lawsuit he filed earlier this month in which he claims he had 'unprotected vaginal sex' with Kourtney in March 2009 at his Glendale, California apartment.

'We don’t trust the results and believe it could have been fixed,' his spokesperson told Radar. 'Still going to court to fight for court ordered results.'

Mr Girgenti had claimed that he fathered Kourtney Kardashian's son Mason amid a steamy love affair.

But
before taking the case to court, he reportedly wrote an impassioned 
letter to the reality star urging her to submit to a DNA test.

According to RadarOnline
the letter, dated April 23, stated that the 26-year-old male model 
wished to avoid dragging Kourtney and her partner Scott to court.

'My attentions [sic] are not to hurt the family you've created with Scott,' Girgenti wrote.

'Please
take this final request for a DNA test seriously,' he wrote before 
taking on a more stern tone: 'Because if you don't, I will be forced to 
take legal action and sue.'

Saddened: Kourtney expressed her frustration that she had to address the ridiculous allegations

He continued: 'I assure you I don't take being a father lightly. I will be a great father to Mason.'

Last week, Girgenti filed paperwork at a Los Angeles County Superior Court in
a bid to get joint custody of the three-year-old child 
alleging he had unprotected sex with the reality TV star nine months 
before Mason's birth.

The lawsuit documents the alleged
relationship between Kourtney and Michael, which he claims heated up in 
August 2008, and continued with months of texting in which she told him 
her relationship with Scott was 'on the 
outs' and 'she wanted to hang'.

According
to gossip website TMZ.com, Michael wanted the judge to order DNA tests 
for Kourtney, Mason and her long-term boyfriend Scott.

Her lawyer recently told TMZ.com on that Gigenti's allegations are 'absurd'.

'This
individual has been selling false and fabricated stories to the 
tabloids for years about Kourtney Kardashian and her son, Mason.  Scott 
Disick is Mason’s father,' Todd Wilson told the website.

'We
have not seen the reported court filing, but we are informed that this 
individual has been seeking to get paid to publish his ridiculous 
pleading.

'His claims
are absurd and this is simply another shameful attempt to gain 
publicity and profit from fictional stories about my client.'

The reality star was seen outside her
lawyer's office on Wednesday, no doubt seeking advice over the 
embarrassing and upsetting lawsuit.

Michael
claims they had full sex and as soon as she had given birth to Mason - 
born on 14 December 2009 - he tried contacting her.

The allegations first came to light 
in March earlier this year when he told In Touch magazine: 'After 
[Mason] was born, and I saw photos of him, I began to wonder.

'I would definitely want to acknowledge Mason if he's my kid - he deserves to know his real father.'

Scott and Kourtney also have a 13-month-old daughter Penelope.

A
legal representative for the Kourtney & Kim Take Miami star 
previously branded the Chicago native's allegations 'preposterous and an
outrageous lie'.

Just last week it was reported that Kourtney was pregnant with her third child.

She
did not comment on the rumours, although was later seen eating sushi 
with her family - a food type pregnant women are advised to steer clear of due to the raw fish ingredients.
