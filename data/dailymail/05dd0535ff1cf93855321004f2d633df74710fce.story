The amount you use the web may not only be affecting your sleep and how you communicate, it could also be influencing who you find attractive.

Researchers have found that women who spend lots of time online prefer more masculine looking men, while men prefer more feminine, thinner women.

The findings suggest that the internet - and most likely media portrayals of certain 'types' - is associated with what people think is attractive.

St Andrews University psychologist Carlota Batres, who led the study, said: ‘One possibility for the difference is the level of media exposure.

For decades, experts believed women flocked to silent types because of their aloof and mysterious nature - but new research suggests its because the trait is actually an ultimate sign of masculinity.

On average, women talk three times as many words each day than men, and their brains are wired to recognise this trait.

When a women meets a man who talks a lot, they consider them to be more feminine and less attractive, yet men who use shorter words and speak more concisely were seen as more attractive because they appeared more masculine.

Silent types who also have deep voices, such as Hollywood actor George Clooney, were considered the most attractive.

'People with internet access are more exposed to the media, adverts or websites, which promotes the beauty ideals of muscly men and thin feminine women.’

As a recent example, the researchers cited the Hollywood blockbuster movie, Noah, in which the male lead is played by the masculine actor Russell Crowe, and the female lead is played by the feminine, thin Jennifer Connelly.

Other masculine men include Hugh Jackman,  while Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is an example of a thin, feminine woman.

The research was carried out in El Salvador, where the majority of people (74 per cent) don’t have access to the internet.

The study asked participants to choose between pictures of people higher or lower in weight, or higher or lower in masculinity and femininity.

Researchers found there was no difference in the preferences of those with access to the internet.

Almost exclusively, they preferred the faces that the internet might suggest are more 'attractive'.

However, non-internet users found masculine, heavier women more attractive, such as Gwendoline Christie who plays Brienne of Tarth in Game of Thrones (pictured). The research was carried out in El Salvador, where the majority of people (74 per cent) don't have access to the internet

However, non-internet users found feminine men and masculine, heavier women more attractive.

The study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, found people with internet access were more likely to have a television in their home, which exposed them even further to the media through commercials, television shows, and movies.

Researchers attributed these findings to several explanations, including economic circumstances influencing perceived attractiveness.

Professor David Perrett, of the Perception Lab at St Andrews University, said: ‘One possibility is that the harshness of the environment may influence face preferences.

‘People without internet in the El 
Salvador study had fewer resources - such as no running water - and such
 harshness may be responsible for what they find attractive.

‘When
 income and access to food is uncertain, heavier women may be better 
equipped to survive and reproduce, and therefore preferences for heavier 
women could be adaptive.

‘Our
 findings are consistent with previous literature that has found that 
heavier figures are considered more attractive in poorer and rural 
areas.’

The study asked participants to choose between pictures of people higher or lower in weight, or higher or lower in masculinity and femininity. Women without web access found feminine men, such as Harry Styles (pictured left) and Zac Efron (pictured right) more attractive

Professor Batres added: ‘Our findings suggest that existing online studies may provide a distorted perspective of the populations in developing countries.

‘Our data provide evidence that, even within a small country, sub-sectors of the population have different preferences.

‘Future research should take this into account when studies are made in countries where a substantial portion of the population does not have internet access.’
