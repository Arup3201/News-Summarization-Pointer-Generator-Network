When Mercedes Talamante mysteriously doubled in weight, she thought it was just a sign she was getting old.

But after weeks of nagging from her daughter, she finally went to see a doctor - who found she actually had a 132lb tumour.

The huge growth, thought to be the largest tumour of its kind, had developed on the Mexican woman's ovaries and was almost half her weight.

The huge 132lb tumour - the largest ovarian growth ever -  was removed from Mercedes Talamante

Surgeons spent four hours operating on Ms Talamante, who almost doubled in weight when the tumour grew

Ms Talamante, 51, had become depressed because of her appearance and thought she had put on the weight because she was aging, but her daughter, Maria, convinced her she was sick.

The ovarian tumour grew for five years until it was almost half of her total body weight, with the Mexican woman barely able to move for the last 24 months.

Before the tumour started growing she weighed 143lbs, but by the time Ms Talamante got to the operating table in late July this year the scales tipped to 275lbs.

Moises Aaron Nunez, the director of Cabo San Lucas hospital, in north-western Mexico, said operating on such massive ovarian tumour was unheard of.

He said: 'We could not find any example of an ovarian tumour this big. There was no precedent anywhere in the world.'

Ms Talamante said at a press conference that she felt like she was 'walking on air' after the surgery

Dr Gilberto Inzulza led the surgical team who successfully removed the tumour, saying the procedure took four hours.

At a joint press conference with the doctor, Ms Talamante thanked the medical team.

She said: 'I feel like a new woman. In fact after the surgery when I took my first steps, I felt like I was walking on air.'

She added that the first thing she planned to do when she got home was to go out with her daughter whose good advice saved her life.
