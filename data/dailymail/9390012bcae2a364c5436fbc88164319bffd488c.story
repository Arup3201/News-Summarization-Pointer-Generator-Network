Queens Park Rangers chairman Tony Fernandes has confirmed that Harry Redknapp will remain in charge of the club.

Redknapp has come under huge pressure after failing to win his previous six matches and reports last week suggested he could be sacked if they lost to Manchester United.

QPR were beaten 2-0 on Saturday, leaving the club 19th in the table with a tough run of fixtures ahead of them.

Tony Fernandes has backed Redknapp despite speculation in recent weeks that he would be sacked

But they are still only one point behind Burnley and Sunderland outside the relegation zone and Fernandes said: 'There’ve been a lot of rumours about Harry’s position being under threat, so I thought it was time to end all the speculation, so everyone can focus on the challenge ahead.

'I firmly believe Harry is the best man to get us out of the position we currently find ourselves in.

'He has great experience and having spoken to him at length over the last week or so, he is determined to turn this around and help us maintain our Premier League status.

'This is Harry’s squad of players, so he is the man to move us forward.'

'The performance against Manchester United showed the players are behind him and that they have the stomach for the fight.

'We know we need to improve our away form and Harry, his coaching staff and the squad will be doing all they can to turn around our fortunes on our travels.' 

Fernandez has urged the QPR players and fans to back their manager until the end of the season

QPR's board will continue to back Redknapp in the transfer market as he looks to bring in more players before the end of the January transfer window he believes can keep the club up.

Fernandes has called on the club's supporters to remain in support of their manager. They have lost all 11 of their games on the road this campaign and face a difficult match away to Stoke next.

That will be followed by a home game against high-flying Southampton and then long journeys to Sunderland and Hull.

Fernandes added: 'The fans have been brilliant all season and all I ask is that they continue to back Harry and the team.

'It’s very tight in the table and we will do our best to strengthen where we can to give us the best possible chance.'
