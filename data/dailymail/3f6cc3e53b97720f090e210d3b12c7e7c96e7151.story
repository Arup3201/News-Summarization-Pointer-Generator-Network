If Republicans should flip six or more Senate seats on Tuesday, they'll control both houses of Congress for the first time in ten years, opening up a host of possibilities that the Democratic-run Senate has blocked under the currently Majority Leader, Nevada Sen. Harry Reid.

Obamacare as we know it? No longer a guaranteed keeper. Immigration reform? Maybe, but on Republicans' terms. The Keystone XL pipeline? Built. Regulations that bring out the Ayn Rand in every conservative? Dead, at least for a time.

Some legislation will still be off the table since President Barack Obama has a veto pen at the ready – and because Republicans themselves aren't unified about how to respond to what Democrats have put in place in recent years. But the legislative game would be changed in some important and earth-shattering ways. 

Every Senate committee will have a Republican chairman or chairwoman in January if the GOP wins control on Tuesday. That will allow them to slow-walk legislation, or entirely refuse to entertain it, in the same way Reid has done since 2007. 

The powerful Judiciary Committee, especially, would become a game-changer, turning on its head the White House's calculations when it chooses to appoint judges – including the next nominees to serve on the Supreme Court. 

In smaller ways, cogs in Obama's governmental machine would find themselves, one at a time, without teeth.

Obama's veto pen will get a workout if the GOP takes control on Tuesday, but he might be forced to face the difficult choice of whether to save unpopular laws or toss out crowd-pleasers 

REPUBLICANS' LEAST FAVORITE REGULATIONS COULD STAND STILL 

The Congressional Review Act of 1996 effectively gives Congress the power to block executive branch regulations at will – the kind issued daily by the EPA, the Food and Drug Administration, the Education Department, and countless other federal agencies and subagencies.

All that's required is for both houses of Congress to pass joint resolutions noting their disapproval. Just like that, the government rule in question is stopped in its tracks and robbed of any effect.

Such resolutions require just a simple majority to pass in the Senate, meaning that with just 51 seats the GOP could team up with an expanding House majority to crush, or at least delay, a wide range of Obama administration initiatives during the president's last term in office.

Obama's signature is still required on a resolution overturning a regulation, just like anything else that emerges from Congress. 

But while the White House wrangles over its PR strategy, the regulatory proposal would sit and collect dust.

Republicans would then announce their intention to override the veto, an unlikely proposition since they lack two-thirds majorities in either house. 

But that process could be dragged out, and the Congressional Review Act would halt the regulation in question until 30 days after they officially give up.

Everything from the administration's EPA rules on coal-fired power plants and water pollution to minimum-wage hikes and unpopular moves that open the borders to Ebola patients could be open for debate, producing consistent howls from Democrats along the way.

WE'LL FINALLY FIND OUT IF IT'S POSSIBLE TO REPEAL OBAMACARE

On a larger stage, changing or repealing the Obamacare law would be the ultimate prize for conservatives in the GOP. Democrats passed it during the president's first term in office, when they controlled both houses of Congress. Not a single Republican voted in favor of the final bill.

Obama at first resisted the GOP's demands for changes to the law, but then put his own in place to delay its phased-in implementation until after the election. 

That has brought howls out of the right-wing's woodwork, and the threat of a lawsuit from House Republicans since precise, hard-and-fast dates were written into the law. Obama, they say, lacked the power to change how the law was implemented without permission from Congress.

Conservatives like Texas Sen. Ted Cruz favor sending a complete repeal bill to the White House now that Obamacare – and Obama himself – are wildly unpopular.

That itself would be tough since it's practically impossible that Republicans will hold 60 seats, the number required to force an end to a debate and call for a vote on legislation.

But current Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has signaled that he's willing to use a special budget maneuver called 'reconciliation' to get around that, setting the bar at just 51 votes. 

Reid invoked something similar in 2013 for the first time in America's history – a play known as the 'nuclear option' – to confirm a group of controversial judicial nominees without Republican support. Now it could be McConnell's turn to move the levers.

Should the president veto an Obamacare repeal bill or let it languish until it expires (a so-called 'pocket veto'), right-wingers would then urge their leadership to pass a rapid-fire series of laws repealing Obamacare one piece at a time, forcing Obama to issue veto after veto and rebranding Democrats as 'the party of "No".'

Will he stick around? If longtime Majority Leader Harry Reid loses his top post, the Nevada Democrat might shirk the role of minority leader in favor of returning to the back bench

Voters in many states have been casting ballots for weeks, but D-Day officially comes Tuesday

CANADA'S KEYSTONE XL PIPELINE MIGHT BE COMPLETED

The White House will certainly hunker down in any event, portraying the Affordable Care Act as a blessing for the previously uninsured. Republicans will follow their lawsuit through the federal courts.

Another game-changer could see an oil pipeline bringing unrefined petroleum from the expansive tar sands of Alberta, Canada to the Texas coastline on the Gulf of Mexico.

The idea was described ten years ago as a job-creation miracle and a way to lower energy costs all across North America. But President Obama's State Department, prodded by environmental groups, has slow-walked the project, crashing into hurdle after hurdle seemingly on purpose.

Canada desperately wants the project to move forward. The alternative is to pipe as many as 830,000 barrels of oil westward every day toward the Pacific Ocean, where it would be refined and shipped to Asia.

If the Keystone XL pipeline were built as planned, much of the finished fuel would go to China and India no matter what, but green groups have struck a 'not in our backyard' pose and urged the White House to delay it as long as possible.

But the State Department's own review board ruled in January, after years of study, that the project would have a negligible impact on the environment.

Whither Obamacare? With Senate and House conservatives both holding Democracy's car keys, it's not clear how much of the president's hard-won medical insurance overhaul would survive by the end of his term

Armed with that document, a Republican-run Congress would likely pass a bill immediately funding the project and forcing Obama's hand. The White House's public position has long been that it's not stalling – merely enduring a lengthy deliberative process to make sure it's doing no harm. 

Republicans will force the issue if they win control of the Senate. And enough Democrats want the project built that Obama may have no choice but to go along.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS COULD GO FROM PROTECTED CLASS TO ENDANGERED SPECIES 

They will also push back hard against what they see as Obama's lawless moves to remake immigration policy in a way that gives unreasonable advantages to people who are in the U.S. illegally. At stake, they say, are the potential bankrupting of the American education system, the availability of jobs for U.S. citizens, the worsening of an already strained criminal justice system, and a host of other controversial shifts in what American life looks like.

The White House has pined for a rewrite of U.S. immigration law since day one of Obama's first term, but used all its political capital to get Obamacare passed – and never thought it would lose control of the House of Representatives in 2010.

As a result, the Obama administration had to rely on a bipartisan 'Gang of Eight' senators last year to craft an immigration proposal that might, just maybe, be palatable to House Republicans. 

The Senate bill passed, containing something for everyone: dramatically fewer deportations of illegal immigrants, increased border security and other political dog-whistles. But conservatives feared the White House couldn't be trusted to hold up its end of the bargain, and the proposal never got a vote in the House.

More walls: Any immigration proposal a new GOP-led Congress might approve would be guaranteed to focus on border security instead of on mainstreaming illegal immigrants – as the Obama administration has sought 

Obama responded by unilaterally putting part of the bill into place with an executive order, guaranteeing that tens of thousands of people brought illegally to the U.S. as children could stay – at least as long as he holds the White House.

He has pledged to go further still after Tuesday's election. 

ANOTHER GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN? IT'S POSSIBLE 

Republicans want to be in a position to stop him, but even in their rosiest scenario they won't take control until the new Congress takes office January 3. At that point they could use the power of the purse to deny Obama the money he needs to put his ideas into practice.

But they have few weapons in the meantime, during the end-of-year 'lame duck' session that's likely to last a few weeks. 

One possibility is another threat of a government shutdown, since the last budget resolution Congress passed expires on December 11.

House GOP leaders could hold that over the president's head and threaten a budget standstill before Christmas in order to force his hand.

A new war of words would surely follow, with Republicans calling the White House lawless and Democrats comparing the GOP to ill-mannered Grinches, jeopardizing the postal service and Americans' benefit checks during the busy holiday season. 

We've seen this movie before. It usually ends with the GOP backing down since it has controlled only the House of Representatives and can't take action without House Democrats. This time could be different.
