Initial DNA tests confirmed that
43 trainee teachers who were abducted by corrupt police ten weeks
ago were incinerated at a garbage dump by drug gang members, Mexican authorities said on Sunday. 

Attorney General Jesus Murillo said that one of
the students had been identified by experts in Austria from a
bone fragment in a bag of ash and bits of burned tire found in a
river where drug gang members said they tossed the students
remains. 

Tests carried out reportedly confirmed the body parts as those of trainee teacher Alexander Mora.

He was thought to be one of the men captured  and murdered on September 26 in Iguala, Mexico, in an apparent bid by the town's mayor to prevent them from interrupting his wife's speech nearby.

Relatives hold pictures of 43 missing students during a protest in Mexico City last week. Mexican authorities on Sunday said that mounting evidence and initial DNA tests confirmed that 43 trainee teachers who were abducted by corrupt police ten weeks ago were incinerated at a garbage dump by drug gang members

Tests: Teeth and bones were sent to a laboratory in Austria which confirmed the identification of one student teacher who was believed to have been murdered by a cartel

'This scientific proof confirms that the remains found at the scene coincide with the evidence of the investigation,'Murillo said. 

'We will continue with the probe until all the
guilty have been arrested.'

The students went missing on September 26 after confrontations with police in Iguala, in southern Guerrero state, that killed three students and three bystanders. 

President Enrique Pena Nieto is facing his deepest crisis
over his government's handling of the probe. 

The case laid bare
Mexico's deep problem of impunity and corruption and it has
overshadowed Pena Nieto's efforts to focus on economic reforms.

One month ago, Murillo said that drug gang members had
confessed to murdering the students and burning their bodies in
a pyre of tires at an isolated dump.

But parents of the missing students have refused to accept
the government's version and at a demonstration in Mexico City
on Saturday night they said they would continue to demand more
answers even after they had heard word of the DNA test results.

The apparent massacre has spurred widespread and sometimes
violent protests throughout Mexico. 

Federal authorities waited
10 days after the students disappearance to intervene in the
case, insisting it was a local matter.

Murillo said that 80 people have been detained in the probe,
including the mayor of Iguala, Jose Luis Abarca, and his wife, Maria de Los Angeles Pineda, who are accused of
ordering the police to get rid of the students from a radical
left-wing college after they staged a demonstration in his town. 

Maria de los Angeles Pineda is said to be the 'key operator' of crime in the town according to the Guerreros Unidos (United Warriors) cartel.

It said that as she was about to deliver a speech on Iguala's plaza in which she would put the case for succeeding her husband forward, she was told that a group of students planned to disrupt proceedings.

To stop this happening, the attorney general said, she ordered the police to deal with them.

Murillo promised more arrests, including 16 fugitive policemen.

During the search for the students in the state of Guerrero,
dozens more bodies were discovered in mass graves. 

More than
100,000 people have been killed in Mexico in gang-related
violence since 2007.

'There is a lot of rage, but it is not just this case,' said
political science student Jimena Rodriguez at the Saturday night
march. 

'There are so many missing, and they do not have the
least interest in really investigating.'
