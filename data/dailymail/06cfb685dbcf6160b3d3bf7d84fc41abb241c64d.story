You can have your cake and eat it too but only if you're willing to fork out an eye-watering $900 (£540) for the bespoke baked good.

Created by Le Dolci bakery in Toronto the extravagant cupcake is thought to be the world's most expensive, beating the current record holder being the $750 Decadence D'Or cupcake at Las Vegas' The Palazzo.

The pricey pud was commissioned by a man who wanted to create a unique and personalised cupcake for his wife's 40th birthday.

Pricey pud: The cake that was created for a 40th birthday contains champagne that costs £500 a bottle and is topped with a sprinkle of diamonds

 Despite its small size, the gourmet dessert is stuffed with high-end luxurious ingredients including an artisan beer and a sprinkling of diamonds.

The expensive treat also contains sea salt from Carmargue in France, Tahitian vanilla beans and Valhrona Cocoa powder. 

The chocolate icing that completes the cake is made using butter from Normandy made by a historic French dairy cooperative, mixed with 70% Amedei Italian chocolate and flavoured with Jamaican Blue Mountain Coffee, which is one of the finest in the world.

The real icing on the cake has to be the pastry cream made with Krug Collection Brut champagne and Rosewood Estate Honey. The champagne alone can cost around £500 in UK shops. 

According to Canada-based bakery Le Dolci, the Amedei chocolate delivers 'undertones of honey, caramel, lavender, vanilla, banana and orange blossom'.

Owner Lisa Sanguedolce wanted to ensure that her customer got his money's worth and as a result no expense was spared.

'The cupcake sits in a hand-made, edible chocolate cup garnished with crunchy edible pearls and dusted with 24-karat gold flakes.

'It is adorned with a edible gold-painted branch with leaves, fondant flowers edged in gold, edible sugar diamonds and delicate hand made champagne caviar bubbles.

'It also features a pipette filled with limited edition Courvoisier that is drizzled atop the cupcake before consumption.' 

While making such expensive desserts is not usually in Lisa's repertoire, she thoroughly enjoyed using all the extravagant ingredients.

Lisa told the National Post: 'The customer was super happy.

'We used all the ingredients that his wife loved and some things that he loved. It turned out to be a really fun project.'
