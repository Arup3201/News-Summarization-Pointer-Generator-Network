A Florida police chief has come to the defense of his officers after a video surfaced on YouTube showing two white Boynton Beach cops dragging a black youth out of a car and threatening his friend with a gun during a traffic stop.

The brief, often shaky cell phone video laced with profanities, which was recorded in February 2013, was uploaded online last month by the user TRAGEDYDAHOTBOY under the title, ‘1 of my encounters with Boynton beach pd…’

The clip begins with a mustachioed and bespectacled police sergeant having a barely audible exchange with the driver of the car and its other occupants, asking them where they live.

Traffic stop: A passenger's cell phone camera was rolling in February 2013 when their car was stopped by police officers in Boynton Beach, Florida

Figure of authority: This unnamed police sergeant asked for the driver's ID because his car entered a 2-mile perimeter set up after an armed home invasion in the area

Bearing witness: An occupant of the car had his cell phone on hand to record their run-in with police 

The officer encounters pushback from the driver, who demands to know why he needs to show his ID card.

'You're driving the car - that's why I need your ID,' replies the sergeant, then adding, 'I need everybody’s ID.'

One of the occupants of the vehicle says that he is going to start recording the traffic stop.

'Turn that phone off right now,' the sergeant orders the young man sitting in the back.

‘No, I have rights. I’m not intimidated, I have right, sir. I'm recording your ass...b****, you're on camera,’ the passenger defiantly declares to the cop.

One of the men then asks the bearded cop to provide his badge number and name, but the officer keeps mum, prompting the occupant of the vehicle to pull out his cell phone to try and take a photo of the officer's name tag.

The situation quickly escalates when the sergeant slaps the phone out of the man’s hand, drags him out of the car and places him face-down on the grass. The passenger’s friends could be heard in the background crying out in disbelief.

A moment later, the sergeant’s partner jumps into action, charging at the vehicle with his gun drawn.

The cop thrusts his weapon inside the cabin, telling one of the men inside: ‘I’ll put a round in your a** so quick.’

Armed and dangerous: A second officer charged at the car with his service weapon drawn  

On Tuesday, Boynton Beach Police Chief Jeffrey Katz posted a detailed comment in reaction to the YouTube video, defending the actions of the officer who was recorded pointing his service weapon inside a car occupied by several young men and threatening to shoot them for refusing to stop filming.

Chief Katz wrote that he first watched the recording a year ago, and lamented that it continues to surface 'despite the fact nobody has made a complaint or provided helpful information from which we could put this incident in context or take corrective action if applicable.'

According to the chief, his staff investigated the incident and determined that the traffic stop took place on February 4, 2013.

Katz explained that the young men in the car were stopped by police because they were within a 2-mile perimeter the officers had set up after a home invasion where the perpetrators were armed with a machete.

‘The persons within the vehicle were – as you can see on the video – less than cooperative and, in some cases antagonistic toward the officers,' Katz wrote in reaction to the video.

He added that the sergeant 'felt threatened' when he saw the driver reach out of the window holding a black object in his hand - which turned out to be his cell phone.

Advocate: Boynton Beach Police Chief Jeffrey Katz has defended his officers, insisting that their actions were justifiable in light of the antagonism displayed by the young men in the car 

Chief Katz proceeded to point a finger of blame at the occupants of the car, who allegedly acted with antagonism towards the officers during the traffic stop, and by doing so provoked the escalation of the cops’ 'stress response.’

‘When I watch this video, I don’t see a car full of young men who are behaving in a manner consistent with fear of the police,’ Katz stated.

‘These young men are escalating this incident, being uncooperative with officers who are investigating a violent crime, and recording their interaction – presumably with the hopes of catching a “gotcha” moment on the part of our personnel.

‘I hate to disappoint them, but no gotcha moment exists here…which is why I suspect nobody ever came forward to make a complaint about this.’

This is not the first time that Boynton Beach police officers were accused of using excessive force and resorting to brutality.

In May of this year, another cell phone video surfaced online showing officers apparently putting a sixth-grader in a choke-hold and kicking him to the ground.

At the time, a police spokesman said that no formal complaint has been filed in connection to the incident, but one officer was placed on administrative leave.

The video of the February 2013 police altercation comes at a time when law enforcement agencies around the nation are facing intense scrutiny, especially in their dealings with black youths, in light of Michael Brown's killing in Ferguson, Missouri.
