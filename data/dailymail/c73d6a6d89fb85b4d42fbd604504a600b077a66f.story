Guilty: Adam Scott admitted to dangling his girlfriend from a bridge

A man has admitted putting his girlfriend through a terrifying ordeal when he dangled her from a motorway bridge by her thighs and threatened to let go.

Adam Scott, 20, was drunk when he dangled her from a motorway bridge as cars drove beneath sounding their horns at the pair.

The attack on the bridge came after a series of assaults by Scott which saw him threatening to kill partner Chelsea Ewart.

Even after he was arrested and in custody, he got friends to pass on messages to try and make her retract her complaint against him, Exeter Crown Court heard.

Scott, 20, of Exmouth, Devon, last year was falsely accused of a rape in Manchester after a DNA mix up - when he had never before travelled north of Bristol.

Now he is back in custody after pleading guilty to harassment and witness intimidation.

Scott admitted putting his ex girlfriend in fear through harassment. The charge states that between November 8 and 30 last year he carried out a series of attacks.

The charge says: ‘He caused Chelsea 
Ewart to fear violence would be used. He hit her and pulled her hair on 
numerous occasions and threatened to kill her using the gas cooker at 
their home.

‘He frightened her with a knife and 
held his forearm around her throat. He punched her and threatened to 
throw her off a footbridge.’

The charge said Scott threatened to 'cut 
[her] up' and then turned on the gas cooker in the house and threatened 
to 'blow [her] up'.

Scott also admitted three offences of 
witness intimidation, including one of sending Chelsea a letter through a
friend. The other two related to a second witness.

Miss Janice Eagles, prosecuting, said Scott's guilty plea to harassment would have to be considered by the officers in the case in consultation with the victim.

Judge Francis Gilbert, QC, adjourned the case and remanded Scott in custody.
