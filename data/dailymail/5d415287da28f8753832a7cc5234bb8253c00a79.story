A week after their big fallout in London, Stan Wawrinka teamed up with Roger Federer to help put him within sight of fulfilling his Davis Cup dream.

The two of them reformed their irregular doubles partnership to defeat France’s Richard Gasquet and Julien Benneteau 6-3, 7-5, 6-4 and give Switzerland what should prove a decisive 2-1 lead in the final.

Federer will  be the first match off against Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the reverse singles on Sunday, and if he can win he would seal a first Davis Cup trophy both for his country and himself, placing his name on the one piece of tennis silverware that lacks it.

Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka put their recent troubles behind them to see of the French pair on Saturday

The world No 2 teamed up with his countryman just days after their very public fall-out at the O2 Arena 

Federer will seal his first Davis Cup trophy if he beats Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the first rubber on Sunday 

Six of the last seven finals that have stood 1-1 at the end of the first day have been won by the side that goes on to claim the pivotal doubles point, so recent history is very much on his side.

The two Swiss, involved in an unseemly spat at the 02 Arena in the Barclays ATP World Finals after Wawrinka rowed with his compatriot’s wife Mirka, have managed to unite in common cause this week.

Federer was named for the doubles an hour before the match, having had no adverse reaction in his back to his heavy beating by Gael Monfils on Friday, his worst ever in this competition.

Having looked somewhat immobile at times in that match, he settled comfortably into the less demanding doubles environment and brought his unique set of skills to bear.

He and Wawrinka had lost their last four Davis Cup doubles rubbers, belying the fact they won the Olympic gold medal together in 2008. However, the Swiss had little choice but to pair them with little strength in depth.

There was a fantastic atmosphere in Lille for the the third match of the Davis Cup tie 

Julien Benneteau and Richard Gasquet were no match for Federer and Wawrinka on Saturday 

The French have more options, but Tsonga was reported to have asked to sit the match out, so they went with experienced doubles specialist  Benneteau and the talented but sometimes brittle Gasquet.

With Mirka again absent the Swiss broke Benneteau in an otherwise tight first set before another feverish crowd in excess of 27,000 inside the Stade Pierre Mauroy. It was hard to believe its usual football audience provides the same noise levels.

In the second set the French forced five break points but Gasquet, returning from the advantage court, could not convert any of them. They paid for it when Federer broke for 6-5 with a glorious backhand return.

With Gasquet, a sporadic doubles player at best, looking increasingly wobbly the superior big match experience of the Swiss was proving a major factor. It was Federer who broke decisively at 2-2 when, with the French crowd now becalmed, he fired a forehand winner right down the middle of the court.

Wawrinka intervened decisively at the net as Federer served out the match with a minimum of drama.

The world No 2 will be desperate to finish the job himself, and providing his back continues to improve, Tsonga did little against Wawrinka to suggest he will be able to stop him.
