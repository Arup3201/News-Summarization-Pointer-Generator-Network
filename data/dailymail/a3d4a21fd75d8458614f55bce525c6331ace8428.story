David Moyes is not a man in any hurry. The next step he takes in football is a pivotal one and must be taken delicately.

He was hurt by those chastening 10 months at Manchester United and by the manner of his dismissal four matches from the end of a dismal season.

He revealed as much in a recent interview with Sportsmail when he said: 'The reason I went to United was because I thought I was joining a club that would give me time. That was the big thing.

'I wanted to take my time working out what I thought was needed.'

He was not afforded that patience but, as he takes time out from the hurly-burly of the game, his stock is slowly rising again.

It's not through anything Moyes has done over the long, empty summer - his first away from football since the age of 16 - but by the unfolding drama at Old Trafford.

The poor start to Louis van Gaal's tenure at United has reflected well on Moyes. Perhaps succeeding Sir Alex Ferguson was and remains the 'impossible job', as Moyes described it in that same interview.

Just one glance at social media following United's shocking 4-0 loss at MK Dons in the Capital One Cup showed how Moyes's reputation has been boosted by Van Gaal's unconvincing start.

His beaming smile was everywhere in memes and Twitter pictures, while one wag created a rather disturbing face morph of the current boss and his predecessor.

Dissent: The infamous plane message flown over Old Trafford calling for Moyes to be sacked

'It wasn't even this bad under Moyes,' was the general consensus, while the anti-United brigade revelled in mocking the latest milestone in United's decline.

It was pointed out that Moyes never lost by more than three goals. Many pictured him having a little chuckle to himself as he watched the League One side fire in the goals.

The Dons' kit suppliers even hired a mobile advertising truck to park outside OId Trafford. Next to a picture of Moyes's face, it read: 'Bring back the Messiah.'  

Of course, it is far too early to judge Van Gaal. He is known as a slow starter in new jobs, is grappling with an injury crisis and has his new signings, including £60m man Angel Di Maria, to come in.

We're only three matches into the season and Van Gaal has a proven track record of winning wherever he has gone. To mock him is a very dangerous strategy.

Big money buy: United this week signed Angel Di Maria for £60m in an attempt to kick-start their season

Reinforcement: Marcos Rojo has also been brought in for £16m from Sporting Lisbon

But the point here is that Moyes is looking better with every United slip-up. Perhaps the man who guided United to seventh in the Premier League wasn't so hopeless after all.

Moyes had more points on the board after two games - he won 4-1 at Swansea and drew with Chelsea - and he managed to get United to the semi-finals of the Capital One Cup.

There were plenty of fans who couldn't wait to see the back of him last season, but attitudes towards Moyes are softening with events currently unfolding.

The blame is focused on him less and less. The sub-par squad bequeathed by Ferguson was the real problem and Moyes didn't have the luxury of expensive summer signings.

Van Gaal has overseen spending of £131m on four players, so an improvement needs to be seen immediately, starting with Saturday's trip to Burnley. There can be no excuses.

It all bodes well for Moyes's future prospects. He appears on the bookmakers' lists for every vacant managerial position and remains highly-regarded despite his bruising experience at United.

He will find employment again sooner or later and he'll most likely do a stellar job given time and resources.

Time heals wounds, histories are revised. It could be that the Moyes era at Old Trafford will come to be viewed in a very different light.
