Moira Wilson is accused of failing to alert authorities when a pregnant teenager arrived at the abortion clinic she ran with a much older man

A nursing manager did not contact social services after a pregnant teenager turned up with a ‘white van man’ asking for an abortion, a hearing was told.

Moira Wilson failed to act after a series of incidents at the clinic in Birmingham where she worked between April 2010 and March 2011, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard.

Wilson is accused of not contacting social services after the 'really weird' scenario unfolded at the Calthorpe family planning clinic in Edgbaston that she managed at the time.

Justine Norman, a disciplinary investigation officer, told the hearing a pregnant 14-year-old had turned up asking for a termination.

She said the girl was accompanied by an adult man who did not appear to be a family relation.

Miss Norman said: ‘This was a really weird scenario - a child turning up with a bloke in his 40s in a white van.

‘This incident was quite memorable and quite shocking.'

She added: ‘It was quite shocking in the disciplinary meeting because I remember that we gave you every opportunity to suggest that you would do things differently if you were presented with the same situation.

‘It was specifically asked if you knew that this child was known to Social Services, would you do the same again, and you replied "Yes".’

While the clinic's policy was to have
 key staff trained in child protection, with one member of staff 
allocated for patients under 16, it was extremely unusual to see a child
 patient, the hearing was told.

Miss
 Norman added: ‘The business as a whole wasn’t set up to deal with 
children - this was an adult service which occasionally had children 
going through it.’

Moira Wilson denied ever seeing the 'white van man' who arrived at the abortion clinic with the 14-year-old girl.

She said: 'I did not meet the girl before she arrived in the theatre suite and at no time did I see the man in the van.

'When I did meet the girl she was in a very upset state and she told me not to ask her questions.

'In
 respect of my not contacting social services, in retrospect, following 
the training that I had, I would have been in a better position to have 
made a different decision'

It is claimed Wilson's colleague Gayle Clark told her to call social services after the pregnant girl turned up with an older man.

Tania Dosoruth, for the NMC, said: ''Mrs Clarke has said that Ms Wilson had knowledge of the patient at a much earlier stage.

'When the concern was raised of that conversation between Mrs Clark and Ms Wilson, then, at that point, the referral should have been made.

'It is not disputed that Mrs Clark was the person at that point who had had spoken to the patient and come to the conclusion that this adult male wasn't a relative.

'It was then that Ms Wilson should have raised that concern.'

Wilson said: 'As I think I think I have already said, I don't know why the girl was known to Social Services, whether it was because of this pregnancy or because of previous family matters.

'I don't know and I have no way of knowing what happened to the girl following her procedure.  That is all I want to say.'

The 
panel also heard that when another patient had kicked aggressively at 
members of staff, Wilson did not complete a critical incident form, 
interview staff members or advise senior management of the incident.

A
 further charge that Wilson allowed a patient to be visible through a 
porthole window in a state of undress while in the operating theatre, 
failing to respect their dignity, was dropped due to insufficient 
evidence.

Wilson, who is expected to hear her fate later today, denies the charges.
