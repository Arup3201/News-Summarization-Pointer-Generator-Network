Wuwei was carrying multiple bags at the time, images captured on surveillance video reveal.

Geng told KCAL-TV via a translator that her son told her on February 13 that he would look at college libraries in town by himself as she shopped.

'Son, where are you? Can you contact me or your daddy as soon as possible and I hope anybody can help me out' Geng told the television station. 

Speaking to KABC through a translator, Geng said Wuwei had approximately $500 in cash, a cell phone, a phone charger, and a credit card.

The translator relayed to the ABC affiliate that Geng's son also refused to show her an item he purchased ahead of the disappearance.

The credit card was not used and the cell phone was shut off, police told KCBS-TV.
