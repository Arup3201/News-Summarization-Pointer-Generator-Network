The surrogate mother at the centre of the controversy surrounding a baby boy who was allegedly abandoned by his Australian parents after they found out he had Down syndrome may face charges in Thailand.

Thai medical authorities are threatening to take action against Pattaramon Janbua, 21, as the Ministry of Public Health and other agencies crack down on medical institutions and clinics linked to the commercial surrogacy the ministry calls 'illegal'.

Thai reports said the ministry was also considering charges against Ms Pattaramon who is a food stall seller from the southern province of Sri Racha.

Thai medical authorities have threatened Pattaramon Janbua with legal action and charges after she allegedly carried the children of an Australian couple

The ministry says the fact that Ms Pattaramon received payment of $16,000 as the surrogate mother of Gammy and his twin sister was in contravention of Thailand's human trafficking laws.

The Bunbury couple, David and Wendy Farnell - from Western Australia - have denied they abandoned the baby boy and returned to Australia with his healthy twin sister.

The couple claims Ms Pattaramon 'misled' the world over the events that led to them leaving the baby behind in Thailand.

But on Tuesday the Thai woman denied this had happened.

Ms Pattaramon was paid a total of $16,000 to be the surrogate mother of Gammy, seven months old, who was then allegedly abandoned by David and Wendy Farnell

'I have never lied or hidden anything. The truth is the truth; it's up to society to make their own judgment,' Ms Pattaramon told Agence France Press (AFP).

It has also been reported Gammy's Australian father was a convicted paedophile.

'Personally, when I heard the news I was shocked but I can't say anything much right now,' Ms Pattaramon said at a press conference in her hometown, adding she would 'leave it to the law' to see if she could get the girl back.

But despite the threat of the Thai law working against Ms Pattaramon in her home country, it could be the exact opposite here in Australia.

Professor Jenni Millbank, a surrogacy law expert at Sydney's University of Technology, said Ms Pattaramon could seek custody of the daughter through the Australian courts.

'She's a legal parent. If she turned up in the Family Court tomorrow, she could seek the return of that child, if that's what she wanted,' Millbank told Nine News.

Meanwhile, seven-month-old baby Gammy is receiving treatment at a Bangkok hospital, where he is being treated for a congenital heart condition.

A spokesman for the hospital said the baby was now receiving specialist care and is 'in safe hands'.

It is alleged the Western Australian couple abandoned Gammy to his fate after they found out he had Down syndrome and a congenital heart condition

Initially David and Wendy Farnell told the Nine network they had no knowledge of the other child, but a statement released on Tuesday said they were told of the baby's existence but that it had a congenital heart condition and was not expected to live.

The case has spurred widespread debate, putting Thailand under the spotlight because of its weak legal framework overseeing surrogacy and in vitro-fertilisation (IVF) laws.

Thai law firm Chaniwat and Leeds, which says it will cover surrogacy and IVF cases on its website, warns of possible 'complicated legal issues'.

'While surrogacy in Thailand is currently an option and a rapidly-growing area of medical innovation, there are a number of legal considerations prospective parents should consider,' the firm told AAP.

The lawyers said Thailand currently has no laws or published case decisions directly relating to the practice of surrogacy, 'and in essence surrogacy is neither legal nor illegal in Thailand'.

Agencies and health clinics openly engage in locating surrogate mothers and egg donors.

'Thailand's Medical Council has taken a cautious approach to the practices of IVF implantation, egg donation, and surrogacy; these practices are still in a legal and medical "grey area",' the firm said.

Investigations are now under way by Thailand's Bureau of Sanatorium and Art in Healing under the Department of Health Service Support (HSS) into the surrogacy service clinics.

There are reported to be an estimated 20 surrogacy agencies, most said to be foreign-owned drawing in an estimated $133 million annually.
