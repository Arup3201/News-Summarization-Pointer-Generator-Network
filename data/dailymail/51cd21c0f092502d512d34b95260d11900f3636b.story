When a strange man attempted to force his way into her Minneappolis apartment early in the morning, Faye Lewis called 911.

However the call was automatically patched five states away to the New York emergency center- and no one can give her an answer why.

The singer and bartender had finished work at her bar job after a busy night and had got home late around 4.30am when the incident occurred last month.

'A few minutes after I got in, there was pounding on my door and someone trying to jiggle my door handle,' she told CBS.

'It was so bizarre ... I dont know how it happened': Faye Lewis has been left without any answers as to why her 911 call for help from Minneapolis went straight through to a call center in New York City

Faye Lewis, a bartender and singer, had returned home late from work when a man started pounding on the door and 'jiggling the handle' of her apartment in Loring Park, Minneapolis

After calling 911 and giving her address, the operator was confused.

'She asked me again what borough do I live in, and I’m like Loring Park,' Lewis told the station.

'I was like I live in Minneapolis and she’s like ''Oh, you dialed 911 in New York''.’

The Minneapolis 911 call center is less than two miles from Lewis' apartment.

The NYPD center, in Queens, is over 1,200 miles away.

Lewis hung up and tried to call again, but the same thing happened.

Fortunately, the New York operator contacted her Minneapolis counterparts with the emergency.

Police arrived at the scene in about 30 minutes.

However neither Lewis' cell provider, T Mobile, or the city of Minneapolis could provide answers over what went wrong with the call.

Luckily for Lewis, the NYPD operator contacted Minneapolis, and police arrived at the apartment block

About 70 percent of 911 calls are now made from cell phones.

When someone dials 911, the GPS chip of their phone usually connects them to to the nearest call center.

The signal goes via a sattelite.

When calling from outside, the signal has a clear path, however when calling from inside a building or home, the signal can be muffled.

Operators ask for a location first for this reason.

Find Me 911 is a coalition based in Washington D.C. that is pushing the government to upgrade the country's 911 system.

Director Jamie Barnett told CBS that the technology for the upgrade is readily available but not being used.

'This is a public safety crisis, really,' Barnett said.

The Federal Communications Commission is supposed to implement new rules for indoor cell phone standards by fall.
