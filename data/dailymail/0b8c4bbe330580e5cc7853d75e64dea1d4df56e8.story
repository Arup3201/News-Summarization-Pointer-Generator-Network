Hong Kong cinema icon Jackie Chan left the Duke of Cambridge humbled when he met him yesterday, mistaking the second-in-line to the throne for his younger brother.

The kung fu movie star revealed that he had congratulated the Duke on his recent trip to the South Pole with wounded veterans.

'Prince William said, 'No, that was my brother', and I said 'I'm sorry'. But they look almost same, huh?' Chan told The Times.

conference at Natural History Museum on Wednesday night. Chan mistook 
the Prince for his younger brother

Campaigners: Both men have made short videos in Mandarin about the illegal trade in endangered wildlife

Like peas in a pod, er... Prrinces Harry and William with their father Prince Charles on their way to Lancaster House for yesterday's Illegal Wildlife Trade summit, which was attended by representatives from 46 countries

The pair met at an evening reception at Natural History Museum in London on Wednesday night for the international Illegal Wildlife Trade summit, which took place yesterday.

Both men, along with the footballer David Beckham and basketball star Yao Ming, have made short videos in Mandarin about the illegal trade in endangered wildlife to urge Chinese to stop buying ivory and rhino horn.

Despite admitting that his compatriots might not recognise Prince William, Chan said the Chinese public knew of him and were more likely to be moved by his appeals than those of his father, Prince Charles.

But there was another Briton who would
 be even more likely to be listened to, the 59-year-old said. 'Beckham -
 people will listen to him because everyone knows him.'

The Duke, Beckham and Yao, a former 
star of the NBA who is one of China's best-known athletes, all feature 
in a video filmed on the pitch at Wembley Stadium, where they are 
surrounded by computer-generated rhinos.

The
 WildAid campaign video tells viewers that the world's entire rhino 
population could fit inside the stadium, but their numbers could be 
increased by stopping the demand for rhino horn.

In the message, William says: 'Together we can save our wild rhinos. When the buying stops, the killing can too.'

Beckham adds: 'Ask your friends and family never to buy rhino horn.'

In a separate video, Chan warns viewers that buying rhino horn supports the dark side of the trade.

'You're
 paying for guns, bullets, poisoned arrows, chainsaws, axes, and 
machetes to hack off the face of the rhino. And you are paying for the 
life of a beautiful creature,' he says.

Versions of both films have also been published in English.

The Prince gave a speech at the 
reception, where he set out a five-point plan to help safeguard 
threatened creatures like rhinos, elephants and tigers as world leaders 
prepared to meet to discuss how to tackle the issue.

His
 proposals ranged from using technology like drones and GPS trackers in 
the fight against poachers to supporting the judiciary and law 
enforcement agencies in tackling the problem.

'Tonight
 we are here with a single, shared purpose - to use our collective 
influence to put a stop to the illegal killing and trafficking of some 
of our world's most iconic and endangered species,' he said.

'Never
 before has a group like this come together - in these numbers - to stop
 the illegal trade in wildlife. All of us in this room have a duty to 
make sure that tomorrow, 13th February, is a date that marks the 
beginning of the end of this despicable trade.

'The
 conference will bring together leaders from around the world who will 
pledge to reduce both the supply and the demand driving this trade.

'Let's not for a second underestimate how important this step is.'

Chan said as a youngster it was common practice for Chinese households to use animal parts as health remedies but he later learned how tigers, elephants and rhinos were killed for the products.

He added: 'This is why I wanted to be a spokesperson against the animal trade, it's my duty to tell the Asian world, the people who believe these kind of things - it's wrong.

'So many of my friends have stopped eating shark fin soup now.'

He added that China's government should ban all ivory trade, because the present policy of licensing its carving and sale left the door open for illicit tusks to find their way into the market.

The event was in advance of a major international summit held yesterday, attented by leaders of countries who have made a commitment to tackle poaching.

The presidents of Botswana, Chad, Gabon and Tanzania were among representatives from a total of 46 countries and 11 international organisations.
