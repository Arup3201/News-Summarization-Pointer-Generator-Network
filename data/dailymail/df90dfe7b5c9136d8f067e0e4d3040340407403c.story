A father of newborn triplets has been arrested on a sex offender violation - just hours after going on TV to explain how he and his family had been left stranded in a motel with 'no way to get home'.

Derrick Sessions, 37, who was wanted by police, was detained at the motel in Houston, Texas, on Tuesday morning after allegedly failing to maintain his sex offender registry status in the state.

His status is related to a 1998 conviction for sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl in Louisiana. The new father was arrested after a detective recognized him in a news report from the previous night.

During the KHOU.com report, Sessions had explained how he, his pregnant wife, Vontivia Mitchell-Sessions, and their 13-month-old daughter had traveled from Orange to Houston in November.

This was because it was the closest city with high-risk pregnancy doctors who accept Medicaid, said Sessions, who served a 10-year prison sentence for his 1998 crime, according to police records.  

Because Sessions is on unpaid leave from his job and Mrs Mitchell-Sessions is out of work, a case worker at The Woman's Hospital of Texas  reportedly paid for them to stay in a nearby motel.

Two months later, the couple welcomed their triplets, Kaitlin, Shariyah and Derrick Jr, into the world prematurely. Shariyah was born with a small hole in her heart, while Derrick has a hernia.

Doctors discharged the babies from the hospital this week, telling the parents they would need to visit specialists in Houston in coming months to treat the infants' serious medical conditions.

First child: Because Mr Sessions is on unpaid leave from his job and Mrs Mitchell-Sessions is out of work, the couple (pictured with their elder daughter) cannot afford to either stay in the city, nor return home, he said

But during his TV appearance, Sessions claimed the couple have no money to either stay in the city until these appointments, nor travel home and then return to Houston  to see the specialists.

In fact, they have said they have no money to return to their Orange home, around 110 miles away, at all, he told reporters.

'We need housing,' Mr Sessions said, explaining how he and his wife had spent all of their savings on an SUV to carry the family home home without realizing it was too small to hold four car seats.

'We can't strap them in,' he added. 'My biggest fear is losing our babies. We need help.'

The Sessions, who wed 16 months ago, are believed to also have several older children.

Because the hospital is no longer paying for their hotel room, they described their situation in the TV report as 'living on borrowed time'. They also claimed they are unable to pay their hospital bill.

Following the news report, several people apparently reached out to help the desperate parents.

KHOU.com has deleted its original story on the couple. It is unknown if Sessions - who would have been aged around 20 at the time of his sex crime - has been charged.
