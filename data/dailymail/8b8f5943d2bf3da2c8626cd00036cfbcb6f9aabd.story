A Boston police officer risked life and limb to rescue a chihuahua that was stuck in a submerged pickup truck on Saturday.

Carver police received a call from South Meadow Village, a 55-plus retirement community where a 2004 Toyota Tacoma belonging to Debra Titus, 59, was under eight feet of water.

Officer David Harriman responded to the call and when he arrived on the scene, removed his gun belt and his shoes and drove into the murky water to save Moochie, the chihuahua.

Moochie's owner, Debra Titus, had managed to get out of the truck and to shore, and one of her two dogs, Stitch, had also swum to safety, leaving little Moochie stranded.

According to the Boston Herald, Titus was on shore 'completely frantic' when Harriman and his partner arrived.

She got the right policeman though. Harriman is described by his colleagues as an 'avid dog lover' and didn't hesitate to get in the water.

'We showed up at the water and saw the vehicle was submerged. We were told a dog was still in it so I did what I felt I should do - go in and get the dog,' he told the Boston Herald.

'It definitely wasn’t easy. I was able to get the door open and then go through some items in the back until I was able to find the dog.'

Moochie was unconscious when Harriman got to him, but came to after he gave the dog 'a little squeeze.'

'He wasn't moving at all when I first got to him, and then when I got him to the surface, he came to,' Harriman told WCBV.

'He'd been under the water for quite some time.'

A grateful Debra Titus was ecstatic to get her dog back alive and well.

Harriman said he has an English bulldog called Jax and that he understands that dogs are like family members.

He had to leave almost as soon as he rescued the job and get back to work, but he returned later to check on the shaken pup.

'An hour later, when I went back to the scene, he looked like a little fluff ball. We’d all do it. I know it’s something that’s important to us,' he told the Boston Herald.
