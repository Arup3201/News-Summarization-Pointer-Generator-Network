Iconic design company Habitat celebrates its golden anniversary this month - and these charming pictures show just how far the furniture giant has come since it’s launch in 1964.

The brainchild of interiors designer Terence Conran, Habitat was an instant hit as it arrived on London's Fulham Road in the midst of the Swinging Sixties.

Hip, young Londoners flocked to the store for its cool interiors and fashionable furniture, and the concept of contemporary lifestyle shopping in Britain was born.

Happy birthday Habitat! The design company is celebrating fifty years in the furniture business this month

Before launching Habitat with the 
help of his wife Caroline, the editor of Queen Magazine, businessman 
Philip Pollock and model Pagan Taylor, Conran had been frustrated
 by the distinctly old-fashioned approach to furniture stores in the UK,

‘We
 see ourselves as the Mary Quant of the furnishing world,’ Conran told 
The Times in 1964, a nod to the iconic fashion designer who is 
credited for inventing the mini-skirt.

Conran wanted to replicate the forward-thinking approach to retailing that had emerged in Europe.

As
 part of his home furnishings shakeup, Conran introduced the humble duvet 
to the UK in the same year, after coming across one on his travels in Sweden. Before then British people slept under blankets with hospital corners. Unsurprisingly the duvet - or 
'continental quilt' as it was called - became a sensation.

Two years later, in 1966, the second Habitat store opened in Tottenham 
Court Road. The same year, the company started to print magazine-style brochures 
featuring photography rather than hand-drawn images of products.

Prior to that all catalogues, including the original 1966 Habitat one, were hand-drawn. Habitat was one of the first British stores to introduce editorial-style 
features in their brochures, such as recipe extracts and how-tos on decorating your home

The Habitat brand went international in 1973 with a store opening in Paris, and by 1980 there were 47 stores open around the globe

In 1969 Conran
 launched Habitat's first mail order catalogue - Habitat Creative Living by 
Post - a first for a furniture retailer delivering nationwide to those 
who could not reach its London stores.

And, long before Ikea, Conran and his team were the first mainstream brand to commercialise the idea of taking away flat-packed furniture and building it yourself at home

Conran
 was in fact doing this in 1952, but Habitat was the champion of 
flat-packing in the 1970s. Their Campus range was key to this,
 being wildly popular with students.

The original Fulham store moved to King’s Road in 1973, the same year that the
 brand went international, with a store opening in Paris.

By 
1980, there were 47 stores open around the globe.

Forward-thinking: Habitat were one of the first stores to utilise the concept of taking away flat-packed furniture and building it yourself at home. Their Campus range was wildly popular with students

Controversial: The controversial duvet cover advert that received hundreds of complaints because it featured a scantily-clad mixed race couple, left, and another 1970s catalogue shot, right

Back in the habit: Habitat's winter catalogue from 1971, left, and it's catalogue from 1975, right. By 1973, when the flagship store moved from Fulham Road to the larger and more prominent King's Road, it also opened it's first international store in Paris

In the 1970s Habitat became known as a brand that liked to push the boundaries, causing a stir in 1973 when it featured a mixed-race couple in bed for a duvet advert.

Criticised for representing ‘un-British sex,’ Habitat were flooded with complaints.

But
 they had the last laugh as the duvet cover collection from this photo 
went on to become one of their best sellers. To this day, duvets are still one
 of Habitats best-selling products.

Conran withdrew from the business in 1990, but the brand continued to grow and create the latest home decor trends.

As
 Britain’s obsession with celebrity grew by the noughties, Habitat – 
true to form – wasn’t far behind. In 2004 it launched VIP collections 
with the likes of Daft Punk, Carla Bruni, Helena Christensen and Manalo 
Blahnik.

However,
 the noughties also saw the rise of high street retailers offering their
 own furniture and homewear - often at a much lower price. For the first time,
 Habitat saw a dramatic fall in sales.

Home comforts: As part of it's home furnishings shakeup, Habitat changed the way we sleep forever, after bringing the duvet to the UK from Sweden

In 1969, Habitat launched its first mail order catalogue - Habitat Creative Living by Post - a first for a furniture retailer delivering nationwide to those who could not reach its London stores

The extent of its financial failings meant the closure of all it's stores except the three London flagships ones in Kings Road, Tottenham Court Road and Finchley Road in the summer of 2011.

In
 2012, Polly Dickens, formerly of The Conran Shop, was appointed 
Creative Director of the brand and set the task of bringing Habitat's 
success back.

A spokesperson told Mail Online: 'It's taken a few years, but now our 
collections are back on form and we are launching new mini stores around
 the UK.

'These are proving hugely popular so we are on track to have 50 by the end of the year. We've refocused on original mantra that
 useful can be beautiful and beautiful can be affordable and people are 
discovering the brand again.'

Now Habitat is celebrating its 50th birthday and plans to open 
50 new mini Habitat stores across the UK by end of year, including one on in Bishops Stortford, Hertfordshire on Friday.
