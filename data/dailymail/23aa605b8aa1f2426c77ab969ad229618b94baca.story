Irish police are investigating a double murder after a mother and daughter were brutally killed in their County Kerry home.

27-year-old Jolanta Lubiene and her eight-year-old child Enrika, which were discovered on Sunday, confirmed the pair died in violent circumstances.

It has emerged that eight-year-old Enrika Lubiene had her throat slit, and was killed alongside her mother, 27-year-old Jolanta Lubiene.

Jolanta was stabbed more than 20 times in her torso as well as receiving a fatal knife wound to the neck

She was stabbed in the kitchen after putting away the shopping and her dinner in the oven.

Their bodies lay dead in their home for 48 hours before being found by a friend.

Ms Lubiene, originally from Lithuania, was found in a room downstairs and the child in an upstairs bedroom.

According to sources, the extensive nature of the stab wounds 
suffered by Ms Lubiene suggest she was the intended victim of the attack.

Police are investigating whether Enrika was then killed because she 
witnessed the attack on her mother and may have known the killer.

A source said: 
‘The scene was awful, because there was so much blood. It was like an 
abattoir.’

It is believed they were murdered sometime between 2.30pm and 5.30pm on Saturday. Enrika was not wearing pyjamas and was dressed in regular clothes.

Police were eventually called to the house at about 8.30pm on Sunday, alerted by another Lithuanian 
woman living locally who had been unable to contact Ms Lubiene.

Enrica, who made her Holy Communion last month, was regularly seen cycling around the estate on the bicycle, and was known for always having a smile on her face.

Her father Marius Lubys flew in from 
Sweden yesterday, where he has been working for the past six months

He told the Irish Daily Mail: ‘I’m shocked. I am very
sorry for my wife and daughter.’

It is understood that the family were due to move back to Lithuania, where the couple came from, in just two weeks.

Detectives believe that the young mother
of one may have known the double murderer, as there were no signs of 
forced entry at their rented semi-detached home, in the Langford Downs estate in Killorglin, 
County Kerry.

They also suspect the killer may be from
Eastern Europe.

It is understood Ms Lubiene had taken out a 
protection order against someone she knew in the past, though this person is not currently a suspect.

Police have ruled out robbery as a motive as nothing was taken from the house. They have also ruled out a sexual motive as both victims were fully clothed.

On Saturday morning, some neighbours 
heard loud music coming from the house, suggesting to gardaí that the 
killer turned up the radio to drown out screams.

Ms Lubiene was last seen at around 1.50pm on Saturday on Langford Street, walking towards her semi-detached home.

Enrika was well known around the Langford Downs estate in Killorglin for riding her bicycle and always having a smile on her face

'She was wearing a dark waist length 
coat, dark trousers and white shoes,' Superintendent Murphy said. 'She 
was carrying two bags of shopping, a pink bag and a white bag.

'Investigating Gardai are particularly anxious to talk to everyone who was in the Langford Downs housing estate between 12 noon and 7pm Saturday last.

'This is a small housing estate with just over 50 houses and with only one vehicle entrance and exit.'

Ms Lubiene had been living in Ireland for several years and working locally.

A technical examination of the scene is continuing. Earlier, Killarney Garda Station Superintendent Florence Murphy appealed for anyone with information to come forward.
