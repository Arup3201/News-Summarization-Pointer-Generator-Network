A 23-year-old man set fire to his house - killing a cat - and overturned his car before knocking on doors with his pants down in search of 'his wife', police have said.

Alex Chambrello, who is covered in religious tattoos, identified himself as 'Lucifer' when police in Wolcott, Connecticut found him flashing homeowners his tattooed behind on Thursday morning.

Earlier that day, authorities had been alerted to a fire in a home's basement just before 8am and it took firefighters 15 minutes to bring the flames under control, NBC reported.

Alex Chambrello, who has multiple religious tattoos, told police he was Lucifer when he was arrested for setting his home on fire before banging on the doors of an apartment complex and threatening a woman

Minutes later, they received a report of a car that had rolled over about a mile and a half away. 

As the police chief, who was nearby, headed to the scene, another call came in reporting that a half-naked man was banging on doors of an apartment complex asking to see his wife, WTNH reported. It is not known if Chambrello is married. 

A woman told police that he threatened to punch her if she didn't let him into her home.

The police chief, Edward Stephens, said he arrived in time to witness some of the bizarre behavior. 

'I pulled into the complex and sure enough there was a gentleman there who we later arrested,' he said. 'His pants were down, his exposed buttocks covered with tattoos, banging on doors.'

Chambrello, who is tattooed with depictions of Jesus and Virgin Mary as well as phrases reading 'Conquer All Evil' and 'This Too Shall Pass', said he was called Lucifer, according to police.

'He said he was Lucifer from Hell the Inferno and he's talking all kinds of gibberish,' Stephens said. 

Chambrello told officers his address, which was the same place where the fire had unfolded.

None of his family were home at the time of the fire, but a cat was killed. Another cat was also missing but was later found with cuts to its face.

Images also show that his car's windscreen was left shattered by the accident.

Chambrello has been charged with arson, cruelty to an animal and breach of peace and is being held on $100,000 bond.
