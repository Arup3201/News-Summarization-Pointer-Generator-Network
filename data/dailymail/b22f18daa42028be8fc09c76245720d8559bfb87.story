Bosses at a Swedish zoo have been accused of barbecuing their own animals for a staff party.

The Parken Zoo in Eskiltuna, west of Stockholm, put two of their own wildebeest on the menu for the event, it is claimed.

Financial constraints were said to be behind the decision to cook the animals.

The wildebeest had been put down prior to the event because the zoo could no longer afford to keep them, it was claimed.

One of the workers at the zoo said he saw colleagues slaughter the animals and was surprised when they were used to feed staff.

Another said: ‘There was nothing wrong with the meat and we thought it was all right. But it feels a bit strange in retrospect.’

The zoo’s chief executive Torbjorn Bergvall denied the meat was used for the barbecue and said somebody was trying to create bad publicity for Parken.

He added: 'These wildebeest were put down because they were aggressive towards other animals at the park. We did not have room for them all.'

The zoo has been in trouble before.

Last year it was accused of taking money from visitors to the zoo which was collected to save endangered species and used it to pay wages.

It was also said to have put down several endangered species, including two cougars, to make way for more spectacular animals.

It was later claimed the cougars died from natural causes.
