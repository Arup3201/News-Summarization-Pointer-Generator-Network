Ultimate tip: Cindi Grady, 51, has told of her joy after being gifted with a new car by a customer

A struggling waitress has told of her joy after being gifted with a new car by a customer, calling it the 'tip of a lifetime.'

Cindi Grady, 51, who works at Cracker Barrel  in Branson, Missouri - where the average hourly wage is  $3, according to glassdoor.com - had been driving around in a damaged vehicle for months after multiple run-ins with deer.

Gary Tackett, a regular at the country-themed diner, noticed the car in the parking lot and thought it was abandoned in such a shabby state.

Two windows were covered with plastic and a strap held together the front end.

But when he asked who the vehicle belonged to and discovered it was  Grady's, he was quick to take action.

'I talked to my wife and said "you know, something needs to be done,"' the Arkansas resident told CNN.

Tackett, who owns a hardware store, purchased a 2008 Ford Fusion for $2,500 in November and returned to surprise Grady a few weeks before Christmas.

A video captured by Tackett's daughter, Chelsea Todd, shows the gifting session taking place.

A bemused Grady is led outside by her manager where she is greeted by Tackett.

'We've been watching you drive that car all summer and we decided that you need something a bit better,' he says, leading Grady out to the parking lot.

'You've got to be kidding me?' Grady exclaims through tears as she's handed a set of keys to the silver Ford parked before her.

'Merry Christmas,' Tackett says, giving the server a big hug.

Grady can hardly believe what's happening as she gets inside the car and starts the engine.

The server, who also takes care of her disabled son around full-time work, said that the kind gesture has restored her 'faith in humanity'.

'I was in a spot where I was depressed. Just feeling like nobody cares, it's very different now.' 

Her 'guardian angel, Tackett concluded: 'It’s all about what’s in your heart I know Cindi said it was her best Christmas ever, and I can assure you it’s ours.'   

After seeing what deer were capable of doing to her old car, Grady has installed deer whistles on her new ride to alert the animals to stay away.

'I’m still shell shocked,' she added.
