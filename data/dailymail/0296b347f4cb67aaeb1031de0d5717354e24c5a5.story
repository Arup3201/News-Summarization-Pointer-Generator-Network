If you want to get ahead in life you need to adopt a rebellious streak, it would seem.

Being a risk-taking rebel may also make you more attractive to women, according to a survey.

Fifty-eight per cent of people questioned for the poll said being a 'goodie two shoes' gets them nowhere, while one in four women admitted they were attracted to men with a rebellious streak.

And almost double that number said they were attracted to strong, independent characters.

Rebellious favourites: King Henry VIII, left and Sid Vicious of The Sex Pistols

Rock stars, royals and footballers have been named among a list of all-time great British rebels, according to the research.

A survey of 2,000 adults by Sailor 
Jerry rum found that Henry VIII topped the poll, with other top 10 
rebels including singer Ozzy Osbourne, ex-footballer Vinnie Jones, and 
Guy Fawkes.

1. Henry VIII

2. Vinnie Jones

3. Ozzy 
Osbourne

4. Oliver Reed

5. Sid Vicious

6. Guy Fawkes

7. Russell Brand

8.
Blackbeard

9. Robin Hood

10. James Bond

Wartime prime minister Winston Churchill 
failed to make the list and was beaten by the likes of Sex Pistol Sid Vicious 
in fifth and comedian Russell Brand in seventh.

The study into attitudes on rebellion also found that John McClane, played by Bruce 
Willis in the Die Hard films is our favourite on-screen rebel.

JR Ewing, from Dallas, came in second, with Jules Winnfield, played by Samuel L Jackson in Pulp Fiction, third.

Steppenwolf's 'Born to be Wild' was voted the best rebellion song ever, followed by Rage Against the Machine's 'Killing in the Name' and Guns n' Roses' 'Welcome to the Jungle'.

Half of 18 to 24-year-olds and those aged over 55 agree that being ruthless and making the most of opportunities are the ways to get ahead in life.

Being loud and outspoken was considered more important than sticking to the rules, which got just 15 per cent of the vote for getting ahead in life.

Meanwhile, 46 per cent of modern men are attracted to women who strive to be different and are unafraid to voice their opinion.

This year marks 100 years since the birth of rebellious tattoo artist Norman 'Sailor Jerry' Collins, whose name is given to the rum.
