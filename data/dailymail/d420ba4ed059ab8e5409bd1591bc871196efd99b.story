Facebook was forced to take down its New Year's Eve message
feature for several hours today after it was found to have a flaw that allows anyone to view and
even delete personal messages intended for other users.

The social network last week launched its Midnight Message
Delivery feature to allow users to send New Year's messages to friends that
automatically arrive on the stroke of midnight tonight.

However, in a major embarrassment for the firm, one student blogger noticed that a simple tweak of
the URL at the top of the page allows users to access messages written by total
strangers - and even delete them.

Facebook launched the service last week, allowing users to send New Year's Eve message in advance, to be delivered to friends at midnight

Aberystwyth University student Jack Jenkins revealed the
privacy flaw on Facebook's Midnight Message Delivery features on his blog early
this morning.

'Facebook have not been very security conscious when setting this up,' he wrote.

'By simple manipulation of the ID at the end of the URL of a sent message on the FacebookStories site, you are able to view other peoples Happy New Year messages.'

By experimenting with the flaw, Mr Jenkins said he was even able to see pictures sent by people.

'It is you may say a pretty harmless flaw, as they tend to be generic messages and you can’t see who sent them (it shows your profile pic next to the message, as if you’ve sent it),' he said.

The site was instead showing an error message today as the firm disabled the feature

'However you can see the names of the recipients of the message.

'Some messages do contain a photo, one such message I saw contained a photo of a father and their child, another a family photo, another was a personally written message with a photo.'

A Facebook spokeswoman early this morning confirmed that it was aware of the issue and was working on a fix.

'In the interim we have disabled this app on the Facebook Stories site to ensure that no messages can be accessed.'

However, by 3pm the firm confirmed the service was live again.
