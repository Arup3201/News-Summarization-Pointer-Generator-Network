The director of a chimpanzee rescue facility where an American student was mauled by two chimps that he was caring for says that the creatures were also victims.

Andrew Oberle, 26, was conducting a tour at the Jane Goodall Institute Chimpanzee Eden on June 28 when he was suddenly dragged under an electric fence and savagely attacked.

The two alpha male chimps, Nikki and Amadeus, also dragged Oberle about a half mile away, and paramedics were forced to wait for armed escorts before they could go in and treat him.

Attack: Andrew Oberle, a University of Texas graduate student was savaged by two chimps while leading a group of tourists at the Jane Goodall Institute in South Africa

Speaking to ABC’s 20/20 this week, institute director Eugene Cussons said the chimps both had difficult upbringings before coming to the institute, and should be considered victims along with Oberle.

Cussons told the network: '[Nikki] used to wear human clothes, he was shaved, it was very much like a human child.'

He added: 'Amadeus had a more traumatic past. He was just a baby and a product of the bush meat trade. Some of his family members were being cooked and served.'

Cussons also said that Oberle should have been more careful while he was conducting the tour, and a slight misstep led to his near-fatal mistake.

He said: 'You have to always keep in mind that these are wild creatures. [Oberle] had a lapse in judgment across the safety boundary and get too close to the main fence, and he took his eyes off the chimpanzees when he did that.'

Oberle, a researcher at the University of Texas at San Antonio, was subjected to hours of surgery following the attack, and suffered large cuts to his head and face that left his skull and facial bones exposed.

During the surgeries, Oberle was kept in a medically-induced coma to keep him comfortable.Mr Oberle's uncle, Carl Oberle, described chimps as his nephew's 'passion' and said he knew each animal by its 'name and face.'

Oberle returned to the U.S. earlier this month, and is currently continuing his recovery process at Saint Louis University Hospital in Missouri.

Calm before the storm: On Facebook these sleeping chimps (not the ones which attacked) are described by Oberle as 'cute'

Shortly after the incident, Cussons said both Nikki and Amadeus were calm and actually exhibited remorse, which he claimed chimps show by behaving submissively. Neither will be euthanized.

Oberle’s mother said that her son had been passionate about chimps since watching a documentary about famous naturalist Jane Goodall in seventh grade.

Mary Flint added that her son knew the risks involved in working with apes, and said that the attack would probably not stop him carrying out further research.

'He adored them,' she said. 'Since he was a little boy he just loved them, and I just have faith that ... when all is said and done, he's going to go right back into it.'

In a case that mirrors that of Charla Nash, a Connecticut woman who had her face torn off by a 200-pound chimp named Travis in 2009.

The sanctuary opened six years ago and is home to rescued chimpanzees, many of which suffered horrific abuse, hunted for their meat or used in the entertainment industry or at roadside zoos.

Recovery: Six months in, Ms Nash showed off her face transplant surgery. Surgeons spent 20 hours re-building her features
