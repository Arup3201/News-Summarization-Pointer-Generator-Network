A man who spent two years in solitary confinement after being arrested for drunk driving has finally received a $15million settlement, one of the largest federal civil rights awards in history involving an inmate.

Stephen Slevin, 58, from New Mexico, sued after Dona Ana County
 jail essentially forgot about him between 2005 and 2007 following his arrest for 
driving while intoxicated.

During his incarceration, Slevin was forced to pull out his own tooth because he was denied dental care by guards and developed bedsores.

He had originally been in line for $22million for the violation of his constitutional rights last January but Dona Ana county appealed the verdict.

Mr Slevin's civil rights attorney Matt Coyte told NBC on Wednesday: 'His mental health has been severely compromised from the time he was in that facility.

'That continues to be the same. No amount of money will bring back what they took away from him.'

Mr Coyte said that his client had shown great courage throughout the trial.

Mr Slevin, who is battling lung cancer, is to receive $6million this week and the rest of the money will come in installments.

At his original trial last year in Santa Fe, Mr Slevin said it was never about the money for him but more about sending a message that prisoners should be treated more humanely.

He suffers from Post Traumatic 
Stress Disorder stemming from what he says was physical and mental 
mistreatment by corrections officials.

Mr Slevin was arrested in 
August 2005 and charged with driving while intoxicated and receiving a 
stolen vehicle near Las Cruces.

His lawyer said that, due to his history of mental illness, he was placed into solitary confinement.

Mr Coyte revealed it was here that his client started to deteriorated. He said: 'They threw him in solitary and
 then ignored him.

'He disappeared into delirium, and his mental illness 
was made worse by being isolated from human contact and a lack of 
medical care.'

While Mr Slevin was in solitary 
confinement, his toenails grew so long they began to curl around his 
feet, he developed bedsores, fungus and dental problems and lost a lot 
of weight, according to the lawsuit.

He was eventually released after 22 months as a pre-trial detainee and the charges against him were dismissed.

It was upon his release that he filed 
the lawsuit, claiming his rights of due process were violated since he 
was not given a hearing before being placed in solitary confinement.
