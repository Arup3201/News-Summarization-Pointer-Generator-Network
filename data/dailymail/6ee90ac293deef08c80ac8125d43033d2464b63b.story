They have no training ground, one of the smallest budgets in the entire Football League and, some might say, little chance of reaching the fifth round of the FA Cup.

But after a weekend of upsets, Rochdale will fancy their chances of adding Stoke City to the list of Premier League casualties on Monday evening.

Manchester City's capitulation to Middlesbrough after a few days in Abu Dhabi does not augur well for the Potters, who have been sunning themselves in Dubai ahead of the visit to Spotland.

Volunteers spent last week clearing snow off the covers while inspirational manager Keith Hill was laid up in bed. 'A little bit of cup fever,' suggests Hill.

He and Rochdale were made for one another. A former defender for the Greater Manchester club, the 45-year-old is in his second spell as manager having led them out of the fourth tier of English football in each of his two tenures.

Rochdale currently occupy a play-off place in League One, and this is the second year in a row they have reached the fourth round of the FA Cup.

Hill's £1.5million budget would hardly cover the wages of Stoke's players for a week, but he dismisses suggestions that Mark Hughes's side might not be up for the fight on Monday night.

'I don't think there will be any surprises for Stoke,' he says. 'They've got quite a few British-based players.

'With the likes of Peter Crouch. Ryan Shawcross, Jon Walters and Glenn Whelan in there, there's a nucleus of players who understand what it takes in a game like this.

'Knowing Mark Hughes, I don't think he will let his team get complacent playing against a team like Rochdale.'

Hill is a big Manchester United fan who saw Hughes win three FA Cup winner's medals during his time at Old Trafford. His favourite memory is Eric Cantona's decisive Cup Final strike against Liverpool in 1996.

'Another one is 1977 when United beat Liverpool. That was one of my first stand-out moments where I said, 'Wow, the FA Cup is special'.

'I grew up admiring Martin Buchan and Gordon McQueen. They're really big players in my memory. I'm not a glory Manchester United supporter, I support the history of the club and what's made it special, even in those days when they weren't so successful.

'Mark was an exceptional player for United and is equally a very good manager. The way he played resembles his teams.'

Rochdale's chairman Chris Dunphy made his money from heating churches and the club are proud to operate within their means — even if they have to do without a permanent training base.

Stoke will be hoping to avoid a fourth round FA Cup upset when they take on League One outfit Rochdale 

Hill says: 'We beg, steal or borrow facilities — the majority of the time we borrow. There's always a plan in place regardless of not having a permanent fixed training venue.

'But we don't go borrowing from the bank. We regenerate our own money which is special, but to continue to be successful is hard. If I thought about it too much I'm sure it would scare me.

'We should really be fighting against relegation because we've got the smallest budget in the league and we're fighting against some really big sides for the opportunity to remain in a play-off place.

'One thing I would say about the players is that they have embraced the FA Cup. We've played nine games in this competition in the last two seasons and only been beaten once.

'It can help the coffers, it certainly does. We don't budget to get so far in the FA Cup. The prize money itself has generated income, but for the players it's about playing Stoke.'
