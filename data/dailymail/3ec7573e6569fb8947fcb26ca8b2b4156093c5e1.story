Reginald Johnson, 69, was caught with nearly £700 worth of crack cocaine under his hat

A pensioner caught with nearly £700 of crack cocaine hidden in his woolly hat was told by a judge that he should be enjoying his retirement instead.

Reginald 'Shaggy' Johnson, 69, was pulled over by police when they spotted him driving 'somewhat strangely' down the busy A19 in September last year.

A court heard officers then search the Vauxhall Omega car and discovered 6.8g of crack cocaine, worth £682, tucked inside a beanie hat that Johnson had been attempting to hide.

Johnson was today jailed at Teesside Crown Court by Judge Taylor - who told him he should be enjoying his retirement.

Mrs Sue Jacobs, prosecuting, told the court how police targeted the pensioner because his car was being driven ‘somewhat strangely.’

Mrs Jacobs said that the pensioner claimed he had been visiting a friend in Huddersfield who had left the hat in his car but in fact he had bought the drugs locally to share with a friend.

Johnson has previously received a five-year jail sentence in 2007 for conspiracy to supply crack cocaine.

The court heard Johnson occasionally puts a bet on the horses but that he also occasionally smoked crack.

Johnson, from Middlesbrough, was jailed for 18 months after he pleaded guilty to possession of crack cocaine with intent to supply.

Passing sentence, Judge Taylor added: 'He should be reaching the stage of his life where he enjoys pensioner status on the outside and not the inside.

'I have no choice but to impose a custodial sentence, but bearing in mind your age and the particular circumstances I am going to be merciful.

'Let me give you this warning, that if you appear in court again for a similar offence it would be a minimum starting point of seven years.'
