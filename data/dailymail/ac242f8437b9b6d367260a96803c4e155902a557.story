The day after Germany's World Cup triumph officially brought the curtain down on the 2013/14 season, Gareth Bale reported for pre-season training at Real Madrid.

As team-mate Sami Kheidra celebrated being a world champion in Brazil, the Wales forward was put through his paces in the sun-drenched Spanish capital.

Bale was among 22 first-team players who underwent a medical in the morning at a hospital in the Spanish capital.

Real's World Cup contingent including the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo, Angel Di Maria, Marcelo and Karim Benzema were exempt from first day of training.

Bale then returned in the afternoon for a session of circuit training and a two-touch match played in intense 34 degree heat.

Real Madrid secured their 10th European Cup by beating city rivals Atletico in May but boss Carlo Ancelotti showed his intent by planning a double session for the players on Tuesday.
