Files shedding new light on Marilyn Monroe's last night alive and her relationships with President John F Kennedy and his younger brother Bobby have emerged 51 years after her death.

Documents belonging to the late Fred Otash, one of Hollywood's most notorious private detectives, were uncovered by his daughter Colleen after being found in a suburban storage unit.

According to Otash, who died in 1992, Monroe had a sexual relationship with the brothers and complained about being 'passed around like a piece of meat'.

Otash, who had installed bugging devices in her Los Angeles home, has long been derided by Kennedy admirers for his claims to have listened to a tape of Monroe and JFK in bed together.

But the notes published by The Hollywood 
Reporter magazine last week contained a detailed account of his bugging 
activities and what he heard.

Shortly before his death, he told an 
interviewer: 'They were having a sexual relationship ... but I don't 
want to get into the moans and groans.'

And in his notes, Otash claimed: 'I listened to Marilyn Monroe die.'

He recorded that on August
 5 1962, she had a violent argument with the Kennedys and that she felt 
that she had been 'passed around like a piece of meat'.

The notes read: 'She was really screaming and they were trying to quiet her down.

'She's in the bedroom and Bobby gets 
the pillow and he muffles her on the bed to keep the neighbors from 
hearing. She finally quieted down and then he was looking to get out of 
there.'

Otash only found out she had died later on.

At that point Otash was the most 
famous private eye in Hollywood and the first choice for any celebrity 
with a potential problem.

Otash,
 a former Los Angeles detective, had set up his own bureau in Hollywood 
where he specialised in 'fact-checking' for a celebrity gossip magazine 
called Confidential.

Among the stars he bugged was Rock Hudson, whose wife apparently confronted him about 
his homosexuality decades before the public knew he was gay and told 
him to 'grow out of it'.

Hudson, who died in 1985 aged 59 due to complications related to AIDS, had been considered one of the most 
desirable men of his day, starring alongside female screen 
icons such as Doris Day in classics such as 'Pillow Talk'.

His
other files include information on Judy Garland and how in 1963 he 
cleaned her Beverly Hill apartment out of all the pills and alcohol she 
had stashed during her bitter split from third husband Sid Luft.

Otash died in 1992 having been used 
as the inspiration for the shady PI played by Jack Nicholson in the 
Oscar-winning 1974 film Chinatown.

James Ellroy, the crime novelist and author of LA Confidential, who met Otash several times, turned his career into a novel, Shakedown, published online and is now writing the script for a television version.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, it was the negative portrayal of Otash in Ellroy's book that persuaded Colleen to search through her father's old records and make some of them public.

'I was very aggrieved,' she said. '[I thought]: what can we do to stop [Ellroy] from taking my father's life and turning it into just a horrible fictional depiction?'

The Otash notes published so far do not reveal what, if anything, the detective discovered when he searched Monroe's house and the tapes of the Hollywood star's alleged encounters with the Kennedys have never surfaced.

A red filing cabinet that contained Otash's most sensitive material was removed from his apartment by his lawyer after he collapsed from an apparent heart attack. Its contents were never seen again.
