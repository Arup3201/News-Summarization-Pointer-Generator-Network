You love your children and you do, of course, want them to grow... but do they have to do it so blinking quickly?

The beginning of every term heralds another wedge of cash being spent on new school uniforms - especially in September, when little people have spent the entire summer running about, climbing trees and growing out of the blazers, shoes, polo shirts and skirts that were baggy on them just four months earlier.

Thankfully, supermarkets are on hand, providing affordable alternatives to pricey department store lines, expensive brands and specialist retailers. And this year, Aldi has beaten the rest, offering a basic set for boys and girls of any age for just £4 - the lowest priced supermarket uniform in the UK.

The beginning of every term heralds 
another wedge of cash being spent on new school uniforms - especially in
 September, when little people have spent the entire summer  growing out of blazers, shoes,  and polo shirts

Parents can pick up two polo shirts, one round neck sweater and a skirt 
or trousers all for £4, along with a whole host of back to school
essentials, in stores nationwide from 25 July.

Comparatively, the same school uniform package costs £6.25 at ASDA and £4.50 at both Sainsbury's and Tesco.

The uniform line - part of Aldi's Specialbuys
 range and available at the flat rates from ages four to 11 - also 
feature add-on essentials, such as boys and girls padded jackets for 
£9.99, a girls pinafore for £2.99, and scuff-resistant shoes for £6.99.

A spokesman said: 'Rigorously tested to ensure its whites stay white, hems don’t drop 
and knees don't tear, Aldi's Specialbuy school uniform range carries a 
flat price across all sizes, so parents can enjoy 
unbeatable value underpinned by excellent quality - for a fraction of 
the usual price tag.'

Round neck jumpers cost £1.25, and plain polo shirt are available from £1

'Our 
Back to School range offers parents the opportunity to stock up and get 
ahead before the summer without breaking the bank'

Tony Baines, MD Buying, said: 'There’s a real 
pressure on parents to kit out their children in brand new clothes, 
shoes and bags at the start of the school year, which can not only be 
pricey, but also stressful for parents after a summer of spending.

'Our 
Back to School range offers parents the opportunity to stock up and get 
ahead before the summer without breaking the bank. 

'We are pleased to offer our customers a fantastic quality school uniform at the lowest price available in any supermarket.'
