Police divers have been called in to scour dams near a home on Sydney's mid-north coast, as the search for missing three-year-old William Tyrell became increasingly urgent on its third day.

The tight-knit community at Kendall is refusing to give up hope for the toddler - last seen on Friday morning playing in his front yard in his beloved Spiderman costume - would be found safe and well.

But police Inspector Kim Fehon warned that time was running out.

'We're now in the third full day of the search for a three-year-old boy who has had no food and, unless he's found water, no water, so it is likely that he has a poor state of health and we need to find him today,' Inspector Fehon told the ABC.

Searchers - including more than 100 volunteers from the local community - have been scouring bushland at Kendall since William went missing at about 10.30am on Friday, September 12, from the front yard of a home on Benaroon Drive. 

Police have been coordinating the search involving New South Wales State Emergency Services and Rural Fire Service volunteers, local surf lifesaving club members, the police dog squad, mounted police, and officers using trail bikes and a police helicopter.

Police divers were called in late on Saturday to scour a number of dams near the area the boy was last seen, as the search area expanded to cover a 10 kilometre area, the NSW Police Force said in a statement.

Searchers are being coordinated and briefed at a designated meeting point at Kendall Showground.

William is described as being of Caucasian appearance with dark hair and hazel eyes.

Searchers spent the night combing through bushland at Kendall but failed to find any trace of William.

He disappeared from his house on Benaroon Drive in Kendall, about 35 kilometers south of Port Macquarie and close to Kendall State Forest.

Police say they have received a flood of calls with support from people hoping to help in the cause. 

Anyone with information should contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000.
