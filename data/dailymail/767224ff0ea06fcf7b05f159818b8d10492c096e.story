New York City Police are being warned against proactively policing in response to anti-discrimination legislation passed recently by the city legislature.The city council last month passed two bills that will make it easier to sue the NYPD for racial profiling, and did so with a veto-proof majority. In response, cops are being told to only answer radio calls and respond to crimes they see taking place – a big change from the proactive policing started in the 1990s under then-mayor Rudy Giuliani.The first bill, which creates an inspector general to oversee the department, passed 40-11, according to reports. The second bill, which allows people to sue for racial profiling, passed 34-17. The bills garnered the votes needed to override any mayoral veto.

Handcuffed: The NYPD's ability to proactively police is severely limited by new legislation aimed at cracking down on discrimination, the department claims

The NYPD Patrolman’s Benevolent Association this week sent a letter warning cops to no longer react to ‘events not occurring in the officer’s presence… [which could] subject the officer to legal action,’ according to a copy of the letter obtained by Mail Online.A veteran officer with more than a decade on the force who spoke to Mail Online said this severely handicaps the department’s ability to protect citizens and turns them from a proactive police force into a reactive force answering radio calls.

Giving the example of an incident involving a black male in his 20s, wearing a white t-shirt, jeans and a Yankees hat, the officer said he can only get on the radio and say ‘suspect is a male wearing a Yankees hat, jeans and a white t-shirt.’

Mentioning a suspect's race could expose the officer to a discrimination lawsuit in a department that won't indemnify officers against infractions as minor as parking tickets, the officer says, asking 'why should I believe they;ll have my back?'Taking it a step further, the officer said that quality of life crimes like drug dealing, people walking around with weapons, and other similar offenses will go largely unpoliced for fear of legal action being taken against an officer.

‘In order to live safely, you have to be willing to give up some of your privacy,’ the officer said.

Not only will it cripple any ability police have to proactively thwart crime, it will also lead to a wave of lawsuits brought against the department by clever kids out for a buck, according to the officer.‘If someone comes up to me and says so and so on the corner has a gun and I go check and he doesn’t have one, I could be sued,’ the officer said, later adding 'as far as we’re concerned, let the city burn.’Stop and frisks are an important part of police work, said the officer, explaining that even if only one in 10 searches turns up a gun, there’s no telling how many lives that may save, ‘even most minorities you talk to aren’t against it.’ The officer is a minority himself.

Not good: NYPD officers argue that recently passed legislation will cause crime to go back to levels not seen since the 80s

In defending the legislation prior to its passage, city councilman Jumaane Williams – the bills’ sponsor – said ‘there have been a lot of bald-faced lies told about this bill,’ according to the New York Daily News.‘We can have safety and can have police accountability at the exact same time,’ Williams argued.A number of prominent politicians and officials disagreed.

The bills ‘would seriously impede the ability of the Police Department and the City to protect 8.4 million New Yorkers” inviting  “avalanche of new lawsuits against police action,’ Michael Best, counsel to Mayor Michael Bloomberg write in a letter to the city council.‘It will achieve the ultimate goal of this bill, to put judges in charge of the NYPD… Crime will soar, murder will rise, children will die,’ councilman Peter Vallone told the Daily News.

‘Crime is going to go back to 80s levels, which is what it will take for people to learn their lesson,’ said the officer.

Mail Online was unable to reach the PBA, Best, Villone or Williams for comment. The NYPD did not respond to a message left for comment.
