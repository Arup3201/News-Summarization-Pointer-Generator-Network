Boasting lavishly decorated pens and exotic names like Bleugems Believe-in-me and Peter Purrfect, these are no ordinary moggies.

From a majestic feline boasting a lustrous coat of perfectly coiffed fur, to a distinctive sphynx cat without so much as a solitary whisker, Birmingham played host to over a thousand pampered pets at the 2012 Supreme Championship Cat Show.

Cat-lovers from all over the country brought their furry friends to the NEC to enter them in the annual show, which is one of the biggest cat fancies in Europe.

Some of the entrants were spotted reclining in pens kitted out with cushions and Swarovski crystals, while others were equipped with curtains for those times when a pampered occupant needs a little privacy.

One owner had even come armed with a double cat carrier on wheels to ferry her felines around the show in style.

The show, which is run by the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy, sees felines competing to be crowned 'Supreme Exhibit' in categories including Persian, Siamese, Burmese, British and Foreign.
