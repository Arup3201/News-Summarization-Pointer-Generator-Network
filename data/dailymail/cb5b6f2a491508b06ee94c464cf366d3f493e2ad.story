A Big Brother star has spoken of her heartbreak after her beloved pet dog was snatched off the street in broad daylight.

Jemima Slade, 42, the second person evicted from last year's series of the hit TV reality show, said she was devastated after her Chihuahua Jakey was taken by a thief in Marylebone, central London.

The salon owner said she didn't sleep or eat for four days after the dog she'd had since he was a puppy was stolen.

Eight-year-old Jakey got out of Ms Slade's flat in Marylebone at about 6.30pm on Monday July 21.

She rushed out after him  as soon as she realised he had gone.

The reality TV star believes Jakey was heading towards Golds Unisex Hair Salon in Bell Street, the hairdressers she co-owns with her mother, but never made it there.

After spending a frantic night searching for him, she was told someone had spotted him in Cosway Street.

CCTV would later appear to show Jakey being grabbed as he walked along the road by a man who threw him into a white van and sped off.

'I was distressed when I saw that,' said Ms Slade, who spent  22 hours scouring local streets trying to find her missing pet.

'I was in shock for four days - I didn't eat and I didn't sleep.

'We got Jakey for my daughter when she was just four.

'She was crying in bed with me last night saying how much she misses him.

'To think the people who have taken him have no compassion for how his owners' feel.

'That is someone else's dog. You can't just take someone's dog off the street.'

Jemima now wants to use her story as a warning to other dog owners to have their pets not just micro-chipped but equipped with a GPS sensor so they can be tracked down.

'He is chipped but not chipped with a GPS chip,' she added.

'Now I want pet owners to join my campaign to ensure their pets get chipped with a GPS sensor so they can be found.'

Ms Slade is determined not to give up in her quest to find Jakey.

She has put posters up as well as putting  appeals for information on every website she can find.

She is also using her Big Brother social media profile to get her message out to tens of thousands of people.

'I will never stop looking for him,' she said. 'We just want Jakey home.

'We have had him since he was eight weeks old.

'To think someone can steal a member of your family and get away with it - well, I am not going to allow it.'
