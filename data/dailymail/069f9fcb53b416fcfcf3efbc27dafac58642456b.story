Giving back: Glenn Close is auctioning off her Damages wardrobe to benefit the mental illness awareness charity she founded in 2010

In drama TV series Damages, Glenn Close's lawyer character Patty Hewes is known for her polished pantsuits, immaculate outfits and expensive tastes.

Now, the 66-year-old actress is auctioning off 380 pieces from the wardrobe for charity.

The looks come from labels that are fitting for a high-powered lawyer like Patty, including Giorgio Armani, Christian Louboutin, Prada and Balenciaga.

Proceeds will go towards Bring Change 2 Mind, a charity Ms Close founded in order to raise awareness of mental illness.

Her ruthless lawyer character certainly had a budget for designer looks such as these, but given that they are going under the hammer on eBay, fans may be able to snag them at a discounted price.

Aside from her signature power suits, Patty's iconic Oliver Peoples sunglasses are also available on the eBay auction, and have so far attracted 31 bids.

Some of the pieces, such as a grey Domenico Vacca jacket, have already fetched more than $2,000.

A black Giorgio Armani shift dress has so far raked in $1,250, while the price of a silk ivory Armani blouse is starting at a more modest $5.50.

In a video for the auction, the actress explains that in real life, she 'doesn't dress like a grown-up'.

Her fictional character, however, had a 'formidable wardrobe' thanks to 'fantastic personal shopper' Frank Fleming, the costume designer for the series.

Mr Fleming has said in the past that a typical Patty outfit costs around $5,000.

He told Xfinity.com that he shopped at Bergdorf's, Barney's, Saks, Akris and Tom Ford for many of Patty's powerful lawyer looks.

Expensive tastes: The clothes being auctioned off by Ms Close include looks from Giorgio Armani, Christian Louboutin, Prada and Balenciaga, to name a few

The nine-day auction will run until next Friday, July 19, in conjunction with the release of the fifth season of Damages on DVD.

Ms Close founded Bring Change 2 Mind in 2010, after her sister Jessie was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

The actress said she was inspired to 
launch the charity when she realized just how ill-informed she was about
 mental illness, despite the fact it was very present in her own family.

'When
 my sister came to me and said, "I can't stop thinking about killing 
myself, I need your help," it was shocking to me,' she told Elle.com.

'I realized how little I know about mental illness, and how badly things had gotten for my sister without me knowing'

'I realized how little I know, and how badly things had gotten for her without me knowing.'

Her
 sister Jessie - whose son Calen had already been diagnosed with 
schizoaffective disorder - was ultimately diagnosed with bipolar 
disorder at the age of 51.

The
 actress launched the charity, with the support of her sister and 
nephew, in order to eliminate the stigma and discrimination surrounding 
mental illness.

'Now that 
Jessie and Calen talk about their illness publicly and openly without 
shame, their recovery has been huge,' she explained.

According to the Bring Change 2 Mind 
website, one-in-six adults lives with a brain-related illness like 
depression, bipolar disorder, PTSD and schizophrenia.

The website allows people to share stories about their own illnesses, in an effort to put an end to common misconceptions.
