While rescuers were able to pull Mr Hardy’s girlfriend Jo to safely, they were forced to call off the search for the father-of-two due to the encroaching darkness.

The security guard’s body was discovered close to Hendon Beach, Sunderland, on yesterday morning when the search was resumed at low tide.

Mr Hardy’s dog made its way back to the beach after the ordeal and is thought to be unharmed.

Mr Hardy’s family last night revealed that the 32-year-old could not swim, praising him for risking his life to save his beloved pet.

His mother Michelle Taylor said: ‘He jumped in to get his dog even though he knew he was putting his life at risk.’

Two lifeboats, a helicopter and a search and rescue team from Humber Coastguard joined the search for Mr Hardy at the Sunderland beach

Mr Hardy’s sister Clare Hall also paid tribute, adding: ‘He went in for his dog because he had a big heart and just loved his animal.’

Posting a picture of him with his beloved caramel-coloured cocker spaniel on Facebook she thanked rescue services for their efforts.

‘Sadly we have lost our brother today. The police and rescue searched hard for him.

‘He would have done anything for his dog and lost his life trying to save him. Just knowing he didn’t suffer is the comfort our family need.’

The 32-year-old's body was discovered close to Hendon beach, pictured, yesterday morning 

Mr Hardy was separated from the mother of his two children, aged 11 and 12, who have been informed of their father’s death.

He had recently moved to Sunderland from Stockton-on-Tees with Jo, who he had only met recently.

Former neighbour Joanne Roach, 43, said: ‘He was a really nice lad and it doesn’t surprise me he tried to save his dog because he loved it, it was a beautiful dog.

‘Alex was all about his kids too, he really loved them and my heart goes out to them and the whole family, they must be devastated.’

‘I know he was happy as he’d started a new relationship with a girl from the Sunderland area.’

A spokeswoman for Humber Coastguard said: ‘Eyewitnesses who called 999 said they believed the two people went into the water after their dog who had got into trouble in the water.

‘The lifeboat crew had just finished another incident to the north of Hendon, when the call came in so they couldn’t have got there any quicker.’

James Jamieson, Sunderland Lifeboat operations manager, said: ‘Shortly after being called to an incident at Marsden, the volunteer crew were diverted to Hendon to begin searching for the man and woman.

‘We were stood down by the coastguard as it became dark, both lifeboats and all our volunteers returned to the station at 8.20pm.

‘Our thoughts are very much with the casualties and their friends and family.’
