A teacher has been accused of deliberately trying to kill her ex-husband's girlfriend by driving her car into her.

Kimberly Ann English is alleged to have told her eight year old son she wanted her love rival to die.

Days later 51-year-old Anna Champagne was found screaming in agony outside her home after being hit by a car that drove onto the sidewalk.

Champagne suffered serious injuries but her life is not in danger.

Police in Lynn, Massachusetts, arrested English after damage to the front of her VW Tiguan was found to be consistent with injuries suffered by Champagne in the hit and run.

English, a special education teacher, had told police her car was involved in an accident but denied hitting her love rival, according to Itemlive.com.

The 49-year-old, a teacher at Ingalls Elementary School, was arrested at her home in Swampscott.

Investigators said English's ex-husband Carl Schroeder learned last week of a threat against his girlfriend.

'His 8-year-old son had informed him 
that a week prior to this incident, the defendant made a statement that 
she hoped Ms Champagne dies,' said prosecutor Erin Bellavia.

'I didn't even think about Kim doing something like this,' Schroeder told police.

English
was arraigned in Lynn District Court on charges of aggravated assault 
and battery with the intent to commit murder, assault and battery with a
dangerous weapon, leaving the scene of personal injury, operating left 
of center, operating to endanger and speeding.

She was ordered held without bail pending a dangerousness hearing.

Lynn Public Schools Superintendent Dr. Catherine Latham said English was placed on administrative leave.

English's two young children were in the house with their father when the hit and run took place.

The boys did not see the incident but heard Champagne, from Sarasota, Florida, screaming out in agony.

Swampscott police said they were familiar with Schroeder and English because of 'tumultuous instances' between the two.

In 2009, English was arrested in an alleged assault on Schroeder, charges that were dropped when Schroeder refused to testify against his wife.

Schroeder told police at the time that English had stopped taking medication for schizophrenia or a bipolar disorder; he said he was not sure which.
