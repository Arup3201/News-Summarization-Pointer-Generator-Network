Scientists in Ohio believe they have identified a drug which could help people suffering binge eating disorder, which often leads to obesity (file picture)

A drug used to treat ADHD could be used to curb binge eating, scientists revealed today.

Binge eating disorder is when a person feels compelled to overeat on a regular basis.

It first develops in young adults, with the NHS estimating there is around a one in 30 to one in 50 chance of a person developing the disorder at some point during their life.

Though similar to bulimia, it differs because sufferers are not compelled to purge the food they have eaten.

Instead many people with the condition become obese, while others attempt to limit weight gain by fasting.

Most patients diagnosed with the condition are treated via psychological or psychiatric therapy, self-help programmes and support groups.

Now scientists at the Lindner Center of HOPE in Ohio have identified a drug, originally approved to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, which also reduces the urge to eat. 

They discovered that at certain doses lisdexamfetamine dimesylate was effective.

There are currently no approved drugs to treat the eating disorder.

Dr Susan McElroy and her team compared the drug with placebo in 514 adults with moderate to severe binge eating disorder during a random clinical trial from May 2011 to January 2012. 

The medication was administered in dosages of 30, 50 or 70 mg/day or placebo.

The study found the two higher doses reduced the number of days each week that people were compelled to binge eat.

But the research team discovered the low dose had no effect.

Their findings also indicate the percentage of patients who managed to stop binge eating for four weeks was lower with the placebo group (21.3 per cent), compared with the 50-mg/d group (42.2 per cent), and the 70-mg/d (50 per cent). 

Dr McElroy said: 'In the primary analysis of this study of adults with moderate to severe binge eating disorder, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate treatment with 50 and 70 mg/d, but not 30 mg/d, demonstrated a significant decrease, compared with placebo, in weekly binge eating days per week at week 11.

'Similarly, binge eating episodes decreased in the 50- and 70-mg/d treatment groups.

'The one-week binge eating episode response status was improved in the 50- and 70-mg/d treatment groups, and a greater proportion of participants achieved four-week cessation of binge eating episodes and global improvement of symptom severity with all lisdexamfetamine dosages.

'Confirmation of these findings in ongoing clinical trials may results in improved pharmacologic treatment for moderate to severe binge eating disorder.' 

The study was published online in the journal JAMA Psychiatry. 

The drug lisdexamefetamine dimesylate is currently approved to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
