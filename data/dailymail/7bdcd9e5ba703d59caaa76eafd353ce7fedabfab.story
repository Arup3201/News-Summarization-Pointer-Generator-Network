Frustrated voters unable to cast their ballots are continuing to wait in huge lines after polls were scheduled to close in states like Florida, where only a handful of votes separate Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.

In Florida, polling places that closed at 7pm remain open, as hundreds of people are lining the streets, still waiting to get in.

Election laws state that anyone who has shown up to vote by 7pm are still eligible to have their votes counted.

The Miami Herald reported that about 70 per cent of voting precincts are remaining open, where people have been waiting up to seven hours.

Election officials told the paper that delays are attributed to what may become a record voter turnout and a 10-page ballot.

Similar situations have been reported in states like Virginia and South Carolina.

In Virginia, the state's Board of Elections Secretary Donald Palmer said there were long lines in Richmond, Arlington, Virginia Beach, Roanoke and Hampton, along with Fairfax County.

'It could go as late as 11 pm with the last of the localities where we receive results because some will go at least two or three hours past the deadline, which was seven, to get their results to the locality and then uploaded to our statewide database,' Palmer said.

The board agreed after the polls closed to delay releasing results because it wanted to ensure voters aren't unduly influenced by preliminary results.

A Twitter hashtag #stayinline is urging any voters waiting in queues to remain where they are.

Americans turned out in droves today to exercise their constitutional right to vote in the conclusion of fierce campaigning on each side.

But for many across the nation, the process of casting their vote for the future president was a slow, laborious process as long lines and those using social media while voting kept things moving at a glacial pace.

Many younger voters wanted to show proof of their vote, posting their ballots to Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram while in the booths, clogging up the flow of voters.

In addition, voters in the tri-state area faced added difficulty casting their vote, as they continued to feel the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. Some in the outer boroughs used their phones for entirely different reasons – using flashlight apps to view the ballots, as their polling centers still haven’t regained power.

Turnout appears to be high in many parts of the country, with long waits at some polling places as voters deliver their Election Day verdict. In suburban Washington, D.C., for instance, voters waited nearly three hours in line.

Both Romney and President Obama need their supporters to show up in high numbers.

A robust turnout among minorities would favor Obama, while Romney is looking for a strong showing among working-class white men.

Several storm-ravaged areas of New York and New Jersey and several swing states are reporting heavy turnout, despite some areas lacking power.

In battered Coney Island in Brooklyn,
the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) set up voter shuttles, giving 
free rides to any residents who wanted to vote.

According
to DNAInfo, many residents found out about the shuttle through 
word-of-mouth, as much of the island remains without power more than a 
week after Sandy.

More than
131 million people turned out to vote for president in 2008, shattering
all previous records. As of 6pm EST, some 6.1million Facebook users had
posted about voting.

In Manhattan’s East Village, which 
was plunged into darkness for nearly five days following Sandy, voters 
snaked around the local polling location, Theater for the New City, to 
cast their ballots.

In early exit polls, Latino voters have turned up in droves. According to a CNN exit poll, the demographic has accounted for around 10 percent of voters, up nine percent from the 2008 elections.

President Obama has been a wide favorite among Latino voters, with around 87 percent saying they would vote for the incumbent.

Though the wait by mid-afternoon was 
nearly two hours, New Yorkers seemed generally good-natured about it. 
‘I’m just doing my civic duty,’ one bundled-up East Village resident, 
who requested not to be named, told MailOnline.

He added that he hadn’t seen any lines at all in 2008, nor, in fact, in the past three elections.

The
queue snaked around a local coffee shop and into the theatre; a coffee 
shop employee was offering chilled voters a hot cup of coffee for only 
one dollar.

But not everyone affected by Sandy felt voting was in the cards this year. In hard-struck Hoboken, New Jersey, across the Hudson River from Manhattan, Anthony Morrone said he's never missed a vote - until now.

'No time, no time to vote, too much to do,' Morrone, 76, told the Associated Press as he surveyed the exterior of his home: a pile of junked refrigerators, a car destroyed by flooding and a curbside mountain of waterlogged debris.

This year, more than 32 million people voted before Election Day, either by mail or in person.

In a number of states, including Iowa, Maryland and Montana, early voting was on track to far exceed totals from 2008.

Social media has also played a monumental part in this election cycle, with Facebook tracking responses of its users to see who voted, and where. 

The social network tracked more than 3.7million users who planned to cast their ballots today, either in person or via mail.

According to Facebook buzz, President Obama was mentioned some 2.3million today on the social network, while former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney was talked about 1million times.

In addition, young voters have been posting pictures of their filled-in ballots to Instagram and other social media sites.

By this evening, there were more than 606,000 pictures of ballots uploaded to Instagram, with rumors flying of its illegality. 

Gothamist reported the act of posting your private ballot to the site is a misdemeanor in New York State. It is also illegal in Georgia, Florida, Kentucky, Michigan, Texas, and Nevada.

Some voters have experienced the consequences. According to AllthingsD, a man in North Carolina had his smartphone taken away after he took a photo of his completed ballot.
