Florida State University's star quarterback Jameis Winston is leaving college to enter the 2015 NFL draft, he revealed today. 

On the same day that Winston announced he's going pro, the woman who accused him of raping her filed a lawsuit against FSU - alleging that the university failed to investigate her claims and did nothing to stop her being bullied and threatened until she was forced to drop out. 

'FSU became a sexually hostile environment where her rapist roamed free and could turn up at any moment, where she became the target of death threats and vilification campaigns,' the lawsuit says, according to the Orlando Sentinel.  

Winston, a 21-year-old junior, says the 2012 sexual encounter with the woman was consensual and has denied that he raped her. The prosecuting attorney's office said there was not enough evidence to charge him. And last month a Florida State University ethics panel cleared him of wrongdoing.

Jameis Winston is expected to be picked early in the first round of the 2015 NFL draft - despite the specter of rape allegations hanging over him

Winston has said that the sex with his rape accuser was consensual. He was never charged with a crime and last month he was cleared of wrongdoing by an investigative panel at FSU 

The rape allegations - along with off-the-field antics, including a shoplifting citation - are likely to keep Winston from being the no. 1 prospect in the NFL draft.

But, with numerous teams desperate for a talented quarterback, he's still expected to be drafted early in the first round. 

'After weighing this decision with my family and friends, I have decided to declare for the 2015 NFL draft and forgo my remaining eligibility at Florida State. I reached this very difficult decision after careful consideration and long thought, realizing how difficult it would be to say goodbye to my family at Florida State,' Winston said in a statement on Wednesday. 

November 25, 2012 - Winston and a teammate are stopped by police after calls 911 because they were shooting squirrels with a pellet gun

November 25, 2012 - Hours later, police are again called over a BB gun battle between Winston and teammates. Damage to their off-campus apartment is estimated at $4,000.

December 7, 2012 - Winston is accused of raping an FSU student at his off-campus apartment.

July 21, 2013 - Winston is accused of filling his cup from a Burger King soda fountain without paying for it.

April 29, 2014 - Winston is stopped by police and cited for stealing $33 worth of crab legs from grocery store. He claims he 'forgot' to pay for them. 

May 20, 2014 - Winston refuses to show up to a student code of conduct hearing meant to investigate the sexual assault allegations.  

September 16, 2014 - Winston reportedly jumps on a table in an FSU cafeteria and shouts 'f*** her right in the p***y!' He is suspended for half a game and apologizes. 

October 13, 2014 - Winston is accused of selling autographed memorabilia, a violation of NCAA rules. He denied the allegations and said 1,000 items with his signature were forgeries.  

Winston - a 6-foot-4, 230lb quarterback - won the Heisman Trophy in 2013 and led Florida State to a 14-0 season and a national championship.

FSU went undefeated again in 2014 - but lost to Oregon last week in the college football playoffs.

The Orlando Sentinel reports that on Wednesday, as news was breaking that Winston is headed to the NFL, the woman who accused him of sexually assault filed a federal lawsuit against FSU. 

The woman, who is identified as 'Jane Doe,' alleges that Florida State violated federal Title IX laws with a 'clearly unreasonable response' to her rape allegations and allowed a 'hostile education environment.' 

The US Department of Education has launched its own Title IX investigation 

The lawsuit details how after she reported that she was raped by Winston on December 7, 2012, FSU athletics officials repeatedly contacted the Tallahassee police detective on the case. 

When a reported contacted the Tallahassee police to inquire about the rape allegation - nearly a year later, a records clerk forwarded the request to the Florida State University police chief David Perry - who then sent it to athletic director Monk Bonasorte. 

Despite knowing about the rape allegations, the officials allowed Winston to suit up for the Seminoles for the 2013 and 2014 seasons.

When the allegations against Winston were revealed, the accuser says, her name was leaked several places online. She began receiving death threats and someone slashed the tires on a car that was parked at her sorority house. 

She was forced to drop out just days later. 

The lawsuit does not name either the Tallahassee Police Department or Winston. It instead focuses on the conduct of Florida State.

The university has not responded to the allegations.
