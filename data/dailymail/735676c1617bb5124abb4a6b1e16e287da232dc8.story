The mother of murdered soldier Lee Rigby has described the moment she knew her son had died.

Fusilier Rigby was killed in a brutal attack in the street outside Woolwich Barracks in south east London in May.

His mother, Lyn, recalled how she suspected her son was the victim as soon as her daughter, Sara McClure, told her about the incident.

Trauma: Lee Rigby's mother Lyn and step-father Ian spoke on ITV's This Morning today for the first time about the harrowing moment when they realised their son had been murdered

Lee's step-father Ian comforted Lyn as the couple spoke out about their grief for their son; their 'fallen hero'

Trying to cope: It's now been over three months since that tragic day - but for the family Lee left behind - they said time hasn't made things any easier

'She said about a soldier had been 
killed in London and I think I knew then that it was Lee because Lee 
always used to phone me if anything had happened or somebody had been 
killed in Afghanistan, anything to do with soldiers being hurt,' she 
told ITV's This Morning.

Trauma: Mrs Rigby said telling her daughter that Lee was the hardest thing she had to do

'I was going to bed because you think 12 hours later it's not Lee, we'd have known. I was trying to convince the little ones because they wouldn't go to bed, but I knew in my head it was.'

She went on: 'The door actually went and I knew who was at the door.

'Two o'clock in the morning, you don't get visitors at that time.'

Ms Rigby added: 'I opened the door and my world just crashed.'

She said breaking the news to her daughter was 'the hardest thing I had to do'.

Fusilier Rigby, a drummer in the 2nd Battalion Royal Regiment of Fusiliers (2RRF), was killed as he returned to Woolwich barracks from the Tower of London on May 22.

He had served in Afghanistan as a machine gunner and was attached to the regimental recruiting team when he was hacked to death in broad daylight.

Michael Adebolajo, 28, and Michael Adebowale, 22, have been charged with his murder.

Fusilier Rigby's stepfather, Ian Rigby, said the family would only attend the start and end of the whole trial, due to start at the Old Bailey in November.

Ms Rigby said: 'I think it will just set me back down again.'
