Vile crime: Victor Gray Dingler, 33, is accused of photographing himself having sex with a girl beginning when she was only 4 years old

An Alabama man has been charged with first-degree sexual abuse following an investigation into child pornography first initiated in Denmark.

Victor Gray Dingler, 33, from Glencoe, Alabama, was taken into custody Tuesday for allegedly photographing himself having sex with a girl beginning when she was only 4 years old.

According to a seven-page criminal complaint cited by the station WBRC, Dingler snapped 29 sexually explicit photos between 2011 and 2012 and then shared them with someone else online.

The affidavit stated that in March 2013, officials from the Department of Homeland Security in Alabama received images depicting sexual acts performed on a child from the Danish National Police, which had flagged them down online.

One of the photos featured a University of Alabama blanket - a clue that would eventually lead to Dingler's arrest.

With the help of the Alabama Department of Education, federal officials were able to track down the alleged victim, who is now 7 years old and lives in Etowah County.

When interviewed by investigators, the little girl confirmed that she was the child depicted in the pornographic pictures, and that Victor Dingler was the man who both appeared in the photos and took them.

Law enforcement officials also spoke to a woman who lives with Dingler and her 3-year-old daughter, who has been identified as a second victim in the child porn case.

According to the arrest affidavit, the 33-year-old Glencoe resident admitted to police on Monday that he engaged in sexual activity with the now-7-year-old girl and the 3-year-old.

Some of the images showed the toddler's privates and her touching Dingler's genitals, the court document stated.

Dingler also confessed that he had produced X-rated images involving both children and distributed pornography involving the older of the two girls through Yahoo Messenger.
