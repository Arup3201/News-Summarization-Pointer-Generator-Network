A mugger was last night fatally shot by an off-duty NYPD detective after he attempted to rob the cop and had attacked him with a cane, police said.

Antoine White, 17, allegedly knocked over Detective Benjamin Cintron, 50, in Brooklyn, New York, on Sunday, while his sidekick simulated a gun.

The officer fired at White while his sidekick ran away, a bullet went through White’s left arm and hit his chest. He died in hospital early on Monday.

Shooting scene: The incident happened on Grove Street in the Bushwick area of Brooklyn at 11:50pm on Sunday as the officer was on his way to a night shift

It marked the third time police had fatally shot someone in Brooklyn this month, following the deaths of Christopher Kissane and Duane Browne.

‘One strikes him over the head with a cane, knocking him to the ground, and the other simulates a gun,’ a source told the New York Daily News.

Detective Cintron identified himself as a policeman and shot White before the other suspect, a 15-year-old who has since been arrested, ran away.
