Sir Bradley Wiggins will only ride in the team pursuit at the Commonwealth Games as he bids to become Britain’s most decorated Olympian in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.

The 4,000m four-man event, which takes place in the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome on Thursday, is one of the few Commonwealth disciplines which also forms part of the Olympic programme.

Wiggins wants to ride in the team pursuit in two years to try and equal Sir Steve Redgrave by winning his fifth Olympic gold.

It would also be the cyclist’s eighth Olympic medal overall, a tally that would take him above Sir Chris to become Britain’s most decorated Olympian in his own right. The Scot won six golds and a silver.

Wiggins said: ‘I’d love to get five gold medals - five sounds better than four in terms of being a nice number - and when I was a kid Steve Redgrave was the one who set the standard, really.

I never imagined that one day I would come close to equalling his medal haul.

‘But then to surpass it in terms of all the other coloured medals that you have, and also Sir Chris, that would be an incredible way to finish.

'I thought: “Just focus on the Olympic event rather than try to be too greedy”. I thought I’d put all my eggs into the one I’m going to do for the next two years.’

Wiggins said training with England’s track cycling squad for the past seven weeks had been the ‘perfect distraction’ from missing out on a place with Team Sky in the Tour de France - which resumes on Tuesday in Carcassonne - but said he had been watching it with his son Ben, a cycling fan.

He added: ‘The road’s so different. It’s not enjoyable, in some ways. You go there and there’s so much pressure because of who you are in road cycling.

‘Everyone’s watching you all the time, whereas you can go into the track and have off days and no-one really sees. It was a nice world, refreshing.

'It was like I had been away for the school holidays and come back to a new year.’
