A student has provoked complaints by parents after taking a photo of her paltry school meal of lunch meat, a couple crackers, a slice of cheese and two pieces of cauliflower.

Kaytlin Shelton, 17, who is eight months pregnant, took a photo of the $3 meal at a Chickasha school on Monday and showed it to her father who said it was not satisfactory.

Her father Vince Holton said: 'I can go pay a dollar for a lunchabe and get more food in it. Schools are responsible for children while they're at school.'

A student has provoked complaints by parents after taking a photo (pictured) of her paltry school meal of lunch meat, a couple crackers, a slice of cheese and two pieces of cauliflower

Kaytlin Shelton told FOX25: 'It makes me want to take that and take it to the Superintendent and tell him to eat it for lunch.'

The new lunch, which is served every two weeks, complies with food regulations championed by First Lady Michelle Obama and implemented by the USDA.

'We have a meat-meat alternate, we have a bread grain, we have vegetable,' Asst. State Superintendent for Child Nutrition Joanie Hildenbrand told the news station after looking at the photo.

'It's the student's choice of what they want to take.'

The Superintendent David Cash admits the meals, which have a calorie limit dependent on the student's age, are not satisfactory.

'You've got in some cases little kids that they're only two meals are breakfast and lunch at school and they're getting you know a grand total of 1100 calories. That's not enough,' he said. 

There are no exceptions for students who are pregnant or those who are athletes and burn more calories on a daily basis. 

USDA regulations  now require foods in the school lunch line to be healthier.

Calorie, fat, sugar and sodium limits have to be met on almost every food and beverage sold during the school day at 100,000 schools. 

Concessions sold at afterschool sports games are exempt. 

Mrs Obama made herself a national emblem of healthier eating in 2010 with a legislative push for more fruit, vegetables and whole grains in school meals, along with less sodium, sugar and fat.

School nutritionists and foodservice workers, and their unions, hailed the law's passage but have since turned on Mrs Obama, saying her caloric inflexibility has sparked a dramatic downturn in lunch sales.

Many school districts, they say, are now losing money on food instead of turning a profit that pays for books, computers and football-field scoreboards.

Mrs Obama said in July that she would 'fight until the bitter end to make sure that every kid in this country continues to have the best nutrition that they can have.'
