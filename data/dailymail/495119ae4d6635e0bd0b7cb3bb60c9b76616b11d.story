Heads dropping: Military morale is at its lowest point since 2008, according to the MoD's own survey

Morale in Britain’s Armed Forces is plummeting, the Ministry of Defence’s own survey has revealed.

Crippling government cuts to the Army, Royal Navy and RAF has sparked a wave of disgruntlement, the figures show.

Redundancies totaling 22,000, botched defence reviews, pay freezes and the axing of perks for service personnel have left the military at its lowest ebb since 2008.

That year, troops were still in Iraq and casualties in Afghanistan were soaring.

Exactly 50 per cent of 12,000 personnel questioned for the MoD’s annual Armed Forces Continuous Attitude Survey (AFCAS) reported low morale in 2012.

The figure is up from 33 per cent in 2010 – when David Cameron’s Tories failed to seize power and were forced into a Coalition with the LibDems.

Until then, figures had been improving in the wake of a high of 54 per cent in 2008.

The number across the services reporting morale was high fell from 25 per cent in 2010 to just 15 per cent this year.

Officers were especially angry - those reporting low morale soared from 32 per cent to 60 per cent over the same period. Commanders have borne the brunt of cuts to pay, pensions and perks.

Nearly 60 per cent of RAF personnel questioned said morale was low, compared to 55 per cent in the Royal Navy, 45 per cent in the Army and 41 per cent in the Royal Marines.

Only last month, Defence Secretary Philip Hammond admitted morale was ‘fragile’, before ploughing ahead with axing some of the most distinguished battalions – including those serving in Helmand.

Under a controversial Coalition shake-up, the Army will be left at its weakest since 1750 while the Royal Navy and RAF are being forced to swallow cuts of 5,000 troops each plus the loss of warships, fast jet and spy planes.

Shadow Defence Secretary Jim Murphy said: ‘These figures are a real worry and a terrible reflection of this Government’s defence policy.

‘A vital benchmark of success is our Forces’ morale and yet it has been damaged and dented by David Cameron and Philip Hammond.

‘A botched review and cuts to vital support have made our Forces feel under-valued and over-stretched.’

Defence Minister Peter Luff said morale would recover.

He said: ‘We have had to make tough decisions to get the defence budget back into balance, including reducing the size of our armed forces.

‘Any change like this is bound to create uncertainty, but the resilience of our personnel should not be underestimated.

‘We are nearing the end of a very difficult period in defence and hope to see morale slowly recovering over the next couple of years.’
