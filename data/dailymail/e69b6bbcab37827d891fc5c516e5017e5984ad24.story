A video of a group of Brazilian soldiers doing a striptease dance with guns could end up with them being stripped of their ranks by their commanding officers. 

The soldiers, said to be from the Amazonas military base in Manaus, are filmed by a colleague dancing to a popular 90s song 'Rhythm is a Dancer' by German band 'Snap!'

The images posted on the internet this week and shown on Amazonas TV, capture four squaddies, in uniform, giving it their all with some mean dance moves that would look good on any nightclub dance floor.

The only problem is they’ve chosen to display their skills in military barracks and to wave guns around as part of their raunchy routine.

The soldiers’ exuberant performances haven’t gone down well with their senior officers.

According to the Amazon Military Command communications office, the army intelligence service has launched an investigation into a ‘possible case of disrespect and misconduct on the part of some soldiers of the corporation’. 

Senior officers are said to have instructed investigators to find out where the film was made, who recorded it and who the military dancing stars are.

One solder, who is half-naked, gyrates enthusiastically like an expert male stripper in front of the camera. He then climbs on to the top of a bunk bed to add emphasis to his sexy moves.

His colleague, who has been winding to the rhythm around the room, grabs his Imbel MD97 standard issue army assault rifle and dances with the instrument held aloft.

At first he points the weapon to the ceiling, then he levels it at the camera. But soon he can’t resist aiming it at his colleagues’ behind as the topless soldier, who has straddled the top bunk, thrusts his body suggestively back and forth. 

Moments later in the video, the same shirtless soldier picks up another gun and waves it around.

The ‘Rhythm is a Dancer’ single, released in 1992, became a huge hit on Rede Globo TV when it was used as a soundtrack during male striptease scenes in a highly successful Brazilian soap opera ‘Body and Soul’.

Most Brazilians who watched the ‘novela’  - as the programmes are called in Brazil, associate Snap’s song with male strippers.

The footage of the military dancers shows them performing striptease moves, with one soldier pulling down his trousers to expose his buttocks to the camera and another making an attempt to unbutton his shirt seductively.

The squaddies star in a sort of 'battle ' dance with the person, recording the images, announcing the names of everyone who enters the 'game'.  The names given to the soldiers are: ' Henry ', ' Baldy ' and ' Cheap Crazy '. The cameraman is heard also alluding to a nightclub located in Manaus city centre.

The dancers are interrupted for a few minutes by a soldier who is filmed at the door of the barracks. It appears he has come to carry out an inspection, but he starts laughing and decides to leave the troops to their antics.

A spokesperson for the CMA said that they are investigating the images to identify which military unit shot the scenes and who is involved.

The spokesperson added: ‘If it is confirmed that the event happened on the spot and they were in service and have exposed the military to ridicule, the soldiers will be warned or even expelled from the army.’
