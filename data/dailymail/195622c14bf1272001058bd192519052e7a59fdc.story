New Tory Cabinet minister Liz Truss has admitted singing anti-Thatcher songs during nuclear protests as a child.

The 38-year-old, promoted to Environment Secretary last week, revealed she joined her parents at to CND protests to the sound of chants of 'Maggie, Maggie, Maggie, out, out, out’.

The daughter of a left-wing academic dad and a Greenham Common mum joined the Lib Dems before becoming a Tory at university and being elected as an MP in 2010.

Miss Truss is seen as one of the rising stars of the Conservative party, tipped by some as a future party leader following in the footsteps of Margaret Thatcher.

But 30 years ago she was joining in with protests against the Iron Lady.

In an interview with The Sun, she said: ‘I probably didn't know what I was saying. I was seven at the time but I definitely remember that is what people were saying, absolutely.

‘We did a number of things like marches, protests. On one occasion when we went down to London in a bus we had made some nuclear bombs made out of carpet rolls — ours didn't quite work because it had floral wallpaper on it.’

Born in Oxford in 1975, her father John was a maths professor and her mother Priscilla was a nurse and a teacher.

She grew up in Paisley, Renfrewshire before attending a comprehensive school in Leeds.

She added: ‘The teachers at my school were quite often card-carrying members of the Labour Party and it just was not part of the culture to approve of what the government was doing.’

She joined the Lib Dems but switched to the Conservatives when studying philosophy, politics and economics at Oxford university.

‘I had never met anyone of my own age that was a Tory, so going to university and seeing people who were Tories and who believed in what I believed in was an eye-opener.’

She was elected MP for South West Norfolk in 2010, and within two years became an education minister.

Miss Truss was among several women promoted by David Cameron in last week’s Cabinet reshuffle, taking charge of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.

Owen Paterson was fired after his disastrous handling of the horsemeat scandal, winter floods and a cull of badgers.
