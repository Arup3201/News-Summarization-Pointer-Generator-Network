A high school student is in a serious condition after suffering burns to his face and neck when a chemistry experiment at an elite New York public high school went horribly wrong.

The accident happened just after 9 a.m. on Thursday in a 10th grade chemistry class at the Beacon School in Manhattan’s Upper West Side.

Teacher Anna Poole, 31, was demonstrating a chemical reaction to the class when suddenly a fireball shot out from her equipment.

The class of 30 students ran for cover but one boy, identified as 16-year-old Alonzo Yanes, was in the wrong place at the wrong time and was quickly engulfed in flames.

Witnesses describe how the fire quickly covered his face, neck and chest, melting his skin as he screamed for help.

One witness has described seeing Yanes’ skin melting.

‘He was burned from his torso up to his hair,’ Jeremy Reynoso, 15, told the New York Daily News.

‘Literally,
 his left side of his hair, I could not see. This side of his ear, the 
left, was twisted. His skin was melting. His eyelids were kind of messed
 up. His skin, a lot of it was melting. I was like, ‘Wow.”’

Both pupils were taken to Weill Cornell Medical Center, with what officials described as 'non-life threatening injuries'

A second student – a girl who hasn’t been named - suffered burns to her hands.

Both were taken to Weill Cornell Medical Center, with what officials described as 'non-life threatening injuries.'

The boy has second-degree burns to 
his face, neck and possibly some damage to his airways, officials said. The girl has first degree burns on her hands.

Another teacher, identified by students as Michael Shum, threw a blanket over the screaming student and doused the flames.

Firefighters and the Department of Education are investigating, it isn’t clear if the students were wearing protective goggles.

The accident happened on the first day of school after the holiday break.
