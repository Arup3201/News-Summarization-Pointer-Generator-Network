A 72-year-old woman created her own 'no parking' zone outside her home after becoming frustrated with the number of cars being left in front of her driveway.

The grandmother, who does not want to be named, said she took action after being repeatedly blocked in by parents on their way to pick up and drop off their children at a nearby school. 

She paid to have a white line painted on the road in front of her home on Culmington Road, Birmingham, and 'no parking' written on the pavement.

The woman also placed traffic cones on either side of her driveway. 

Parents of pupils at Albert Bradbeer Primary School, which is less than half a mile away, have branded her decision 'ludicrous'.  

The grandmother-of-five called the police during a dispute last week with a couple who she claims parked in front of her home twice on the same day.

She said: 'The couple deliberately came and parked and blocked me in. They have children at the school - two little children - and I went to see who was parking there and blocking me in.

'In the afternoon he came back again. I said "You again? I'm calling the police".' 

She claimed the man started racially abusing her and mimicking the way she talked.

She added: 'I had to get the police involved. They told me to put something visible up so people would know there's no parking.'  

'I have lived here 20 years and this is the first time I have had any trouble.

'Sometimes you overlook things. I don't mind people parking on the public bit but not parking on my driveway that I paid to make.'

Parents at the school have branded the woman's decision 'extreme'.

One mother, Katey Large, who walks her children to school along the road every day, said: 'There have been days when the lady who lives there sits outside in a chair underneath the window and tells people they can't park there and she's gone to extremes now by painting that on the road. 

'People with drop kerbs don't want people parking on them but to go to the extreme of painting it yourself is ludicrous.

'As if Birmingham doesn't have enough litter on the streets, we're are teaching people it's OK to paint lines on the footpath. It's crazy.'

But she added: 'You quite often see parents in the morning walking up the road and sniggering, but if it was outside their house they wouldn't be laughing about it.'

A spokesman for Birmingham City Council said: 'She doesn't have the right to paint on the road because road markings are subject to traffic laws.

'If it's on her property that's different but if it's on the public highway, it's not allowed.'
