A Morrisons employee has been arrested after the bank details of about 100,000 members of staff were stolen and published online.

The man was arrested in Leeds - close to the supermarket's headquarters in Bradford - earlier this morning following the theft of payroll information from a central database.

West Yorkshire Police confirmed that a man had been arrested on suspicion of making or supplying an article for use in fraud and said he remains in custody.

Leak: The man was arrested in Leeds - close to the supermarket's headquarters in Bradford - earlier this morning following the theft of payroll information from a central database

Detective Chief Inspector Gary Hooks of West Yorkshire Police said: 'An employee of Morrisons has been arrested in Leeds this morning in connection with an investigation into the theft of data from the company.'

The theft was seen as a fresh blow to Morrisons, especially as it came just one day after Britain’s fourth biggest supermarket tumbled to a £176million annual loss and issued a profits warning.

The warning sent shares down by 12 per cent and saw the supermarket pledge to cut prices to compete with Aldi and Lidl.

The company said the data theft affected staff from all levels of the organisation including the board, but would not comment on whether chief executive Dalton Philips was among them.

The supermarket said it became aware 
of the data theft last Thursday, hours after it announced financial 
results to the City and that Mr Philips was leading the response.

It
 wrote to all employees with an email address to inform them of the data
 theft, while managers were also informing workers at its sites.

Morrisons
 did not say how many of its 130,000 employees were affected, although 
initial reports suggested it could be as many as 100,000.

The
 leak was revealed by the Telegraph and Argus, a local newspaper based 
in Morrisons' home town of Bradford, after 'a concerned Morrisons 
shopper' sent the data to it.

It is not known for how long the information was available.

Morrisons
 said: 'We can confirm there has been no loss of customer data and no 
colleague will be left financially disadvantaged.'

It added that it was urgently reviewing internal data security measures, with an
 investigation into the incident to be led by Mr Phillips.

Employees took to social media to vent their anger at the company after the publication was revealed.

Many criticised the company for announcing the news on Facebook before all staff had been personally informed.

One wrote: 'A hack? So why weren't these details encrypted and what not?'

Another
 added: 'Reading about this on Facebook does not inspire confidence, we 
should have been notified by phone by our HR departments first thing 
this morning.'
