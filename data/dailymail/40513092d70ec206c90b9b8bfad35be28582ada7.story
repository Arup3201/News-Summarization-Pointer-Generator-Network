This is the embarrassing moment a student became a fashion victim when she took a tumble in her six-inch platform shoes.

Decorative art graduate Terri Winghei Ng, 22, took a tumble during the ceremony in front of hundreds of people - as her six-inch platform shoes buckled on stage.

Split seconds before she fell Terri had taken a selfie to record her proudest moment on her camera phone - but pride turned to humiliation as she fell over at Nottingham Trent University.

Made for walking? It all starts so well as Terri Winghei Ng, 22, manages to put one foot in front of the other at her graduation ceremony at Nottingham Trent University...

Nice trip? She loses her balance as she tries to stride across the stage - unbeknown to her, a friend's family is recording it all for posterity

Down and out: She blames her tumble on the fact that her shoes were loose and she was wearing no socks

Terri, who lives in Nottingham but is originally from Hong Kong, said: 'I was planning to take a selfie on the stage because there was a university alumni competition for the best one. 

'I thought I would do something ironic and that it would make everyone smile.

'There were a lot of people there and I thought they'd all love it if I took a selfie.'

The art student was wearing state-of-the-art decorative fashion heels big enough to make pop icon Lady Gaga blush when she slipped in front of hundreds of people watching the ceremony.

Little did Terri know the whole scenario was captured on camera by friend Chloe Nicholls' family who were sat in the stands watching the ceremony. 

She added: 'When I got onstage I was really nervous and I realised my shoes were a bit loose. I'd been walking around all day in them until then with no problems so I thought it would all be fine, but I just slipped.

'I'd worn them before but this time I wasn't wearing any socks underneath so that's probably why my feet gave way because there was nothing for them to grip. 

'Once you start falling there's no going back. It was horrible and I could feel everyone watching me.

'When I fell down I just didn't know what to do for a split second. It all happened so quick and it was so embarrassing, but at least I saw the funny side later.'

Graduate Terri, who is a huge fan of the frenzy of smartphone self-portraits loved by celebrities such as Kim Kardashian and Kelly Brook, added: 'The picture's come out a bit blurry because of the fall and obviously I was pretty nervous and shaky at the time. But I got everyone in behind it - it's definitely a picture worth keeping.'
