Never one to shy away from telling people what he thinks of current technology trends, Steve Wozniak has now turned his attention to Google Glass. 

In a recent interview, the Apple co-founder said he admired Google Glass owners who are brave enough to try something new, but believes the technology 'makes no sense in terms of what it does.'

He also labelled previous smartwatches disappointing, and said they should never replace a person's phone.

But, the 64-year-old did praise Apple boss Tim Cook for breaking the 'dogma' that had come from Steve Jobs by releasing larger phones, in the form of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

Speaking to the Australian Financial Review, after becoming an Australian citizen earlier this month, Mr Wozniak said: 'I feel like the coolest person in the world when I am wearing [Google Glass].

Experts predict 2015 will be the year when people forsake gadgets, social networks and other technology in favour of the simple life.

Recent figures have already revealed that certain social networks are losing favour, and now a digital trends report believes we are entering the era of the ‘neo-Luddite’.

The prediction was made by London-based communications agency Hotwire in its sixth annual Digital Trends Report.

‘While there are many early adopters out there scrambling around to get their hands on the latest smartwatch or iPhone, there are a group of much cooler kids working out ways to kill tech altogether,’ explained the report.

‘Welcome to the era of the neo-Luddite. They’re here to make sure you switch off.’

'When I see people wearing it, I also think they are cool because they are brave enough to play with the future with a device. 

'[But], in my mind, it is a great product that will not succeed.'

He added Google will need to find one great commercial application for it to appeal to the masses, but added he hopes the firm doesn't give up on the technology.

Mr Wozniak co-founded Apple with Steve Jobs during the 1970s, and was responsible for designing the Apple I computer. He left the company in 1987.

In terms of smartwatches, Wozniak told AFR that no company has yet been able to create a 'compelling' device, and he had been disappointed with early models of the technology.

'Like Apple did with smartphones, one company may point the right way to a smart and useful watch, but it shouldn’t be a replacement for what the phone does,' continued Mr Wozniak. 

'And it should have an unbelievable and fun feeling when you use it.'

Looking forward, Mr Wozniak said connected cars are likely to be a popular trend next year.

Apple’s 4.7-inch iPhone 6 and the 5.5-inch iPhone 6 Plus were the first devices to break away from the firm's typical 4-inch displays on previous handsets.

They were unveiled at the Flint Center for the Performing Arts at De Anza College in Cupertino in September. 

Mr Wozniak recently told a conference in Texas that if Apple had released a larger screen, sooner, it would have been able to steal a larger portion of the smartphone market from its rivals over the past three years.
