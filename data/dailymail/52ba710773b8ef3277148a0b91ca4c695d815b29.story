The Duchess of Cornwall’s son was targeted by the News of the World, the phone hacking trial heard yesterday.

The tabloid’s former royal editor, Clive Goodman, admitted he hacked Tom Parker Bowles’s voicemails, along with those of an equerry to princes William and Harry.

Goodman, 56, was jailed in 2007 after he admitted hacking three aides to the princes, but said the newspaper’s hacking operation had also targeted other people associated with the royals.

He said he had hacked the brothers’ equerry, Mark Dyer, and Mr Parker Bowles, but denied he had also paid palace police officers for information.

Goodman, who worked at the News of the World for 20 years before his 2006 arrest, had previously admitted hacking Helen Asprey, who worked as a personal assistant to William and Harry, their private secretary Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, and Paddy Harverson, the former press secretary to the Prince of Wales.

He said he had hacked Mr Dyer in 2005 and had ‘briefly’ hacked Mr Parker Bowles in 2006 after suggesting the now defunct tabloid should carry out an undercover sting on the food journalist.

Goodman denied he had paid palace policeman for information, despite emails he sent to editor Andy Coulson asking him to approve payments.

He said Coulson, 46, signed off the requests for payments for internal phone directories for the Royal Household but told jurors the payouts were not really made to police officers.

He said he had lied when he said his contacts were policemen in an attempt to ensure his articles would get published and his real sources would get paid.

Goodman denies conspiring to commit misconduct by paying public officials. Coulson denies conspiring to hack phones and conspiring to commit misconduct.

Former Sun and News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks, 45 – whose 13-day marathon testimony ended last week – denies conspiring to hack phones, misconduct and perverting the course of justice.

Seven hacking case defendants are   being tried by a jury of 11 people after one female juror was discharged after being signed off ill.

The trial, which is being held at the Old Bailey, continues.
