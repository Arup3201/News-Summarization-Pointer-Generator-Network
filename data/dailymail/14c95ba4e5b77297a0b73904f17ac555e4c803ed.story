These amazing photographs show the stunning beauty inside of the Vatican and churches in Italy.

Photographer Richard Silver, 52, spent more than two years capturing unique visions of well-known houses of worship, including the Santa Maria della Pieta in Venice.

The church is known by classical music lovers for being associated with Vivaldi and his young female musicians who were orphans.

Some of the other churches Silver, from New York, visited were the magnificent Sant'Ignazio, dedicated to Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Society of Jesus, and the ornate Church Del Gesu in Rome.

He has taken photos of churches in Beijing, Istanbul, Easter Island, Milan, Rome, London, Warsaw, Singapore, Shanghai, Goa, Dubai, Trieste and Venice.

Silver, who spent two years on the project, said: 'Each photo takes me about an hour and a half to photograph.

'About 45 minutes before sunset, during sunset and about 30 minutes after the sun. I am a very symmetrical person this format worked perfectly.

'What I need is a clear night, no flat grey sky. I need blue skies so I can capture the change of light, a cloudy night just doesn't cut it for this situation.

'I shoot with a Nikon D800 mostly I shoot with a 24-70 2.8mm Nikon lens too. Always on a tripod and I use a remote control to take the photos.

'A remote gives me freedom to walk away a little from standing in one spot for so long and there is no vibration to the photo.' 

Around 25,000 people visit the Vatican in a single day, around five million a year.

Entry to the Vatican Museums and Sistine Chapel costs €16, earning the Vatican an annual revenue of around €80 million or £70 million a year. Sisto conducted his first Mass in the chapel on August 1483.

The Sistine Chapel is most famous for Michelangelo’s frescoes, but long before Michelangelo, Sisto commissioned painters such as Botticelli to fresco the two long walls of the chapel.

One side told the story of Moses, the other the story of Christ. Even without Michelangelo’s work, these earlier paintings still represent one of Europe’s greatest fresco cycles.

Michelangelo began work on the ceiling in July 1508. The completed frescoes were unveiled in October 1512.
