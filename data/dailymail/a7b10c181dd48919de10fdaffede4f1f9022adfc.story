A huge fire at the Hilton Hotel in Southampton meant Eastleigh's game against Lincoln in the Conference was postponed on Saturday - as the players boots  were inside the hotel along with medical equipment.

Nobody was hurt, but the Lincoln side had some possessions damaged in the blaze which needed 55 firefighters to try and put it out.

The fire was believed to have begun in the sauna of the hotel and started almost four hours before kick-off.

The players had to wait in the car park before their conference game with Eastleigh was eventually called off

The game was initially delayed for an hour, so Lincoln's team-talk was carried out on the team bus and the players had to go to a nearby supermarket  for their pre-match meal.

Lincoln are 16th in the conference, while Eastleigh are 10th, and they thanked their fans who had made the near 400-mile round trip without seeing a ball kicked.

'We would also like to thank our supporters who had made the long trip down to Eastleigh for the game, especially with the fixture coming on the back of last week's FA Cup tie and the midweek journey to Gateshead,' Lincoln said in a statement on their website.

'We fully understand your frustrations but, as you can understand, public safety at times like this is far more important than a game of football.'
