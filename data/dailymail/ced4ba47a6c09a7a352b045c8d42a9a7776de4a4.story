Given how he divides opinion, there’s probably the same number of people who feel sorry for Arjen Robben as there are who believe the 2022 World Cup should be in Qatar.

Notwithstanding that the Dutchman is the footballer with the closest skill-and-thrill set to those of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, the fact that he is ruthlessly dedicated to persuading referees that any contact or attempted contact on him around the area is a penalty alienates many.

However, anyone with an ounce of generosity, everyone who admires his fabulous combination of athleticism, pace, skill, technique and power should find it easy to generate some sympathy for the 30-year-old.

Now that he has dominated his own physique, applying intelligence and research to avoiding being injured every four or five months, it is enormously frustrating to realise how much football he has missed.

Instead of his reputation being given sheen by having been champion of every country in which he’s played (Holland, England, Spain and Germany), or having scored the winner in a Champions League final, the pall of blowing opportunities to achieve absolute greatness hangs stubbornly over him.

Within five torrid weeks in spring 2012, he missed two penalties. First, against Borussia Dortmund, when a win would have put Bayern joint top of the Bundesliga but defeat doubled the existing three-point gap. In due course Jurgen Klopp’s team won the title.

Robben has been with Bayern since 2009, where he has won three Bundesligas and the Champions League

Then, in that gut-wrenching, disastrous defeat at Bayern’s own stadium in the Champions League Final against Chelsea, Petr Cech easily saved Robben’s extra-time penalty at a time when Bayern were motoring and the Blues, frankly, didn’t look like they had another goal in them.

Add that to the one-on-one miss against Iker Casillas in the 2010 World Cup Final against Spain. His career may be in full bloom but through Robben’s 21-trophy time line there emerges a thread of pain, disappointment, failure and ill-fortune.

Just as he reaches the absolute peak of his form and fitness, the Dutch national team have become immensely idiosyncratic. They reached that World Cup final four years ago, but contested it like bar brawlers. Euro 2012 was horrific, but they ended Brazil 2014 in third place and just millimetres short of a place in the final, shredding Spain en route.

Thus far, the post-World Cup era is nothing short of a botch-up — five defeats in the last seven matches, including a classic pratfall in Reykjavik against Iceland. Guus Hiddink has promised to quit should Holland lose to Latvia.

Robben is an immense footballer yet, when the Ballon d’Or is awarded in January you can take it that he won’t be in the top three with Ronaldo (winner) and Messi (second). Bayern team-mates like Manuel Neuer and Philipp Lahm and Real’s Toni Kroos might be, while Gareth Bale is a decent bet to finish above Robben. The winger’s best finish is eighth.

He says: ‘2013 was a brilliant year in terms of trophies. I won the Treble with Bayern. But in terms of my own professional development and sheer intensity, 2014 has been outstanding. The best yet. I’ve played all year without any major injuries and was on superb form physically during the World Cup.’

Beyond ending his reputation of being made of crystal, physiologically, Robben has also shown steely fortitude mentally.

‘Spring and summer 2012 was a very difficult period. There were those penalties I missed and then, after the Champions League final defeat to Chelsea, we came back to a Holland friendly days later to suffer jeers and whistles in the Allianz Arena, our own stadium.

‘Then catastrophic games in Poland/Ukraine 2012 when Holland was knocked out in the first round. It was like living a nightmare.

‘Getting the decisive goal in the Champions League Final against Dortmund was such a liberating moment.’

And, compared to the threat of Latvia robbing Robben of another international manager, his club career at Bayern — good candidates for a second Treble in three years — could not be better.

The Dutchman is in thrall to his club coach and admits Pep Guardiola has made him a better player. Developments for which Hiddink will be deeply grateful.
