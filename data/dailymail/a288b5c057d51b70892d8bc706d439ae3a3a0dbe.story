A University of Oklahoma fraternity has been shut down after members were caught chanting the n-word and glorifying lynching in a sickening video - on the same day that President Obama spoke at the 50th anniversary of the Selma march.

The footage, uploaded to YouTube Sunday, shows members of a Sigma Alpha Epsilon chapter singing that there 'will never be a n*****' in their fraternity.

In the brief clip, one two students stand up to a group of their peers, wearing bow ties and dress shirts, in the vile chant, sung to the tune of If You're Happy And You Know It.

The footage is believed to have been filmed on Saturday - when the rest of the nation was focused on Selma, Alabama, where the president said the civil rights movement has not yet completed its long march.

'There will never be a n***** SAE': The vile chant was made by members of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity chapter at the University of Oklahoma

The idiotic student could be seen leading the chant as one of his friends tried to stop the filming 

National heads of Sigma Alpha Epsilon closed the fraternity Sunday night after the video was shared widely online, and suspended all of its members. 

During the sickening clip the students are clearly heard singing: 'There will never be a n***** SAE, there will never be a n***** SAE.

'You can hang him from a tree, but he'll never sign with me, there will never be a n***** SAE.'

A female voice in the background can also be heard asking a friend: 'You've never heard it before?' 

The footage shows the group on a bus, apparently headed to a party. It was made public by a black students' pressure group at the university called Unheard.

In the wake of the video, the national leadership of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, which has branches across the country, said the University of Oklahoma chapter would be punished.

Reaction: The national heads of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon have said those responsible will be punished

Frat house: The SAE base at the University of Oklahoma is pictured above. The national organization has some undergraduate 15,000 members

Brad Cohen, the Eminent Supreme Archon of the organization, confirmed that the video was authentic.

He added that he was 'shocked and disgusted' by it, and said those responsible 'will be dealt with'.

Cohen also said the song, which the video participants seemed to know well, was not part of any SAE traditions.

A statement from SAE said: 'Sigma Alpha Epsilon's national headquarters has closed its Oklahoma Kappa chapter at the University of Oklahoma following the discovery of an inappropriate video.

Investigation: Oklahoma University President David Boren released a statement via Twitter saying the 'behavior will not be tolerated'

'Reprehensible': The university's president, David Boren, said investigations were underway and warned this behavior would not be tolerated

Shut down: National President of Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Brad Cohen, took to Twitter to say the fraternity chapter had been closed and called on the university to expel the students involved

'In addition, all of the members have been suspended, and those members who are responsible for the incident may have their membership privileges revoked permanently.

'We apologize for the unacceptable and racist behavior of the individuals in the video, and we are disgusted that any member would act in such a way.

'Furthermore, we are embarrassed by this video and offer our empathy not only to anyone outside the organization who is offended but also to our brothers who come from a wide range of backgrounds, cultures and ethnicities.'

Timing: While the SAE members were chanting, President Obama was addressing crowds in Selma, Alabama, on the 50th anniversary of the civil rights marches there

Anniversary: The sickening chant was made exactly 50 years after the march for civil rights led by Dr Martin Luther King, center above, from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama

SAE has more than 200 chapters across the country, 15,000 undergraduate members and around 200,000 alumni. The mission of Sigma Alpha Epsilon is 'to promote the highest standards of friendship, scholarship, and service for our members based upon the ideals set forth by our Founders and as specifically enunciated in our creed, The True Gentleman.'

For more than half a century, new members are required to memorize and recite the following:

'A True Gentleman is the man whose conduct proceeds from good will and an acute sense of propriety, and whose self-control is equal to all emergencies; who does not make the poor man conscious of his poverty, the obscure man of his obscurity, or any man of his inferiority or deformity; who is himself humbled if necessity compels him to humble another; who does not flatter wealth, cringe before power, or boast of his own possessions or achievements; who speaks with frankness but always with sincerity and sympathy; whose deed follows his word; who thinks of the rights and feelings of others, rather than his own; and who appears well in any company, a man with whom honor is sacred and virtue safe.'

David Boren, president of the University of Oklahoma, said that the University had launched its own investigation into the video.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s national headquarters has closed its Oklahoma Kappa chapter at the University of Oklahoma following the discovery of an inappropriate video. In addition, all of the members have been suspended, and those members who are responsible for the incident may have their membership privileges revoked permanently.We apologize for the unacceptable and racist behavior of the individuals in the video, and we are disgusted that any member would act in such a way. Furthermore, we are embarrassed by this video and offer our empathy not only to anyone outside the organization who is offended but also to our brothers who come from a wide range of backgrounds, cultures and ethnicities.

This type of racist behavior will not be tolerated and is not consistent with the values and morals of our fraternity. We have more than 15,000 collegiate members across the nation, and this incident should not reflect on other brothers because this type of hateful action is not what Sigma Alpha Epsilon stands for. This is absolutely not who we are.

We teach our members to serve as role models in their communities and to live up to our creed, “The True Gentleman.” When members fail to do so, we will not hesitate to take corrective actions or to impose sanctions. Any behavior that is not aligned with the conduct we expect is unacceptable. Equally unacceptable is bystander behavior of members who fail to intervene when they witness conduct that deviates from our beliefs.

“I was not only shocked and disappointed but disgusted by the outright display of racism displayed in the video,” said Brad Cohen, the fraternity’s national president. “SAE is a diverse organization, and we have zero tolerance for racism or any bad behavior. When we learned about this incident, I called an immediate board meeting, and we determined with no mental reservation whatsoever that this chapter needed to be closed immediately. I am proud of my fellow board members because we mean what we say.”

Alumni who serve on the chapter's house corporation board and who serve as advisers are appalled by the video and the song that was sung in it. They do not condone offensive and hateful behavior and will hold accountable the men who participated in the incident.

Although Sigma Alpha Epsilon regrets the closure, we believe members must be held responsible for their actions. We are hopeful that we can re-establish the Oklahoma Kappa chapter at some point in the future with a group of men who exemplify our beliefs and who serve as leaders on campus and in the community.
