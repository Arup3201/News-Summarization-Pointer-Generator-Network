Busted: George Boedecker was charged with DUI in the bizarre arrrest on Sunday

A Crocs co-founder was arrested and charged with drunken driving in a bizarre confrontation where he allegedly blamed country crooner Taylor Swift - who was thousands of miles away.

The trouble began for George Boedecker, 51, on Sunday when the entrepreneur was discovered slumped over the wheel of a black Porsche in Boulder, Colorado.

Police and paramedics said that when 
Boedecker got out of the car, which was partially on the sidewalk, he 
had trouble keeping his balance and was slurring his words.

A witness told police that Boedecker had gotten out of the car, and first said that he had pulled over to take a nap. 

He later changed his story completely, saying that his girlfriend had been driving, and she is 'bats*** crazy.'

Boedecker, whose other business ventures
include Domino's Pizza and Quizno’s, was approached by an officer, who 
asked what had happened.

A police report obtained by TheSmokingGun.com said that Boedecker told the officer that his girlfriend had been driving, and she ran away after the two had an argument.

When asked about the girlfriend, Boedecker told the officer that she is a singer who is 'really f****** famous.' He then asked if the officer had ever heard of Taylor Swift.

When the officer pressed for information about where the girlfriend went, Boedecker allegedly motioned toward a neighbouring backyard, and then said 'Taylor' was in Nashville.

The officer wrote that Boedecker then became agitated, saying he was done with the questions that that things were about to get 'mid-evil.'

Shortly after that, Boedecker was arrested, but he apparently was not done talking, as the officer noted that the philanthropist told him and another responding officer to 'go f*** themselves in the a**' and that he hoped the cop would 'f****** die.'

Unfortunately for Boedecker and his story, Swift was in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, at the time of his arrest with her actual boyfriend Conor Kennedy and his family - about 2,000 miles away.

And while Swift has dated such A-listers as Jake Gyllenhaal, Taylor Lautner, and John Mayer, there is no evidence to suggest she has ever been romantically linked to Boedecker.

On Monday, however, she was in Nashville, announcing plans to release her fourth studio album - 'Red' - on October 22.

She said during a live web chat that the album is all about emotions.

Swift said: 'They're all pretty much about the kind of tumultuous, crazy, insane, intense, semi-toxic relationships that I've experienced in the last two years.' 

She added: 'All those emotions spanning from intense love, intense frustration, jealousy, confusion, all of that, in my mind all those emotions are red. There's nothing in between.

'There's nothing beige about any of those feelings.'
