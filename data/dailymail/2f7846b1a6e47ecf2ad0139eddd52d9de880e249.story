Just 24 hours earlier, she had rallied the faithful by proclaiming she would be 'more than a dress' in the battle for Number 10.

But today Justine Miliband laid aside the austere black frock she picked for her address to the Labour party conference and slipped into something a little more feminine for husband Ed's keynote speech.

The outfit, a £245 navy jacquard design by LK Bennett, exuded grown-up sophistication. It was a fitting choice for a high-flying barrister who until recently has been one of Britain’s more reticent political wives.

Justine Miliband chose an eye-catching LK Bennett dress to watch her husband deliver his keynote speech in Brighton on Tuesday

On Monday the Labour wife claimed that she was more than just a dress as she spoke to Young Labour delegates

The high end High Street brand is also a favourite of Samantha Cameron and the Duchess of Cambridge, and the fitted floral dress is part of a slick new wardrobe that Justine has deployed for the annual event at a crucial time in her husband's political career.

To give her Young Labour speech on Monday the mother-of-two chose a classic black flared dress worn with LK Bennett heels and statement jewellery.

She told supporters: ‘I wanted to come along to say a few 
words because I thought, “If I don't say anything to you guys tonight 
probably all you'll know about me this year is the make of the dress I 
wear for Ed's speech on Tuesday”.

‘That's
a side of me the media tend to focus on and I thought it was quite 
important to reassure you that I am in fact more than a dress.’

Her carefully crafted words on the first day of
the conference were just one part of a plan to 'humanise' husband Ed 
and rescue his plummeting poll ratings. 

Previously Justine has been one of the more reticent political WAGs but is stepping up her involvement as Ed's poll ratings plummet

Justine was also snapped in a vivid red mac and smart black trousers on a photo
opp tour of the city with husband Ed in his 'smart casual' best on 
Friday.

Although always a stylish dresser, previously the child actress-turned barrister has been one of the more reticent politcal WAGs, and Ed has repeatedly claimed he would not 
copy David Cameron’s habit of eye-catching photo opportunities while 
opposition leader, and would instead focus on policies.

But party strategists plan to put Justine 
on the political frontline in the run up to the 2015 election and this week the Justine and Ed show has been unleashed on the world.

The decision to bring Mrs Miliband into the
political fray has drawn comparisons with failed attempts by Gordon 
Brown and Iain Duncan Smith to use their other halves to rescue their 
leadership.

As Justine promises to speak out publicly about why her husband of nine years should be Prime Minister, the Milliband children too have been 
wheeled out in front of the world's press, swinging arm in arm along 
Brighton beach like a mini Boden campaign.

Brothers Daniel, four, and Samuel, two, have even been labelled as the party's secret conference weapon.

The couple met in 2004, but didn't get married until 2011 when Justine chose an understated Temperley dress with no veil. As well as revealing her plans to take to the 'barricades' in support of husband in 2015 the environmental lawyer also revealed the 
moment she realised she had fallen for him – while rearranging 
chairs in a hall in Doncaster.

She told delegates: ‘In May 2005, Ed was the prospective parliamentary candidate for Doncaster North. I was his friend.

‘So
I went to Doncaster to help him campaign and I was moving chairs around
in a hall getting ready for a campaign meeting and I became aware there
were three long-standing party members watching me.

‘After
a while one of them said to me who was I, so I explained that I was a 
friend of Ed's and I had come from London to help him campaign.

‘There
was a pause and then the lady said to me, “That's a very long way to 
come to move chairs, are you sure you're just friends?”.

‘She was clearly very astute and realised before we did I think.’

The
mother-of-two also told Young Labour members she is willing to help 
them in the run-up to the 2015 general election before joking: ‘After 
all you now know I can door-knock, I can move chairs although I guess 
falling in love at the same time probably gave it a bit of a different 
dimension. Nonetheless I am ready and willing.’

Ed Miliband was forced to defend the 'cheesy' family photographs, which contrast sharply with 
Gordon Brown’s refusal to be photographed with his own young children 
and the former Prime Minister’s accusation that David Cameron used his 
own family as ‘props’ in photographs.

Asked by the BBC’s Andrew Marr why he had
decided to bring them into the public eye ‘with 500 cameras’ present, 
he said: ‘I love having my family here. It’s a great support and a great
thing for me to have them here.'

Ed Miliband has defended the pictures of him and his family saying: ¿I love having my family here. It¿s a great support and a great thing for me to have them here.'
