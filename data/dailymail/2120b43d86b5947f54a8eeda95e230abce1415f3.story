The man stabbed to death with a stiletto heel over the weekend has been identified as a professor at the University of Houston, authorities announced today.

The victim, identified as 59-year-old Alf Stefan Andersson, worked at the University of Houston Center for Nuclear Receptors and Cell Signaling where he focused on women's reproductive health. He'd been with the university since 2009.

The details of the relationship between Andersson and the suspect, 44-year-old Ana Lilia Trujillo, remain unclear as authorities continue to investigate the vicious attack.

"The University of Houston community is saddened to learn of the tragic death of Professor Stefan Andersson. Our hearts go out to his colleagues, family and friends during this difficult time," the university said in a statement released today.

According to authorities, police were called to the Parklane Building - a luxury condominium building popular amongst professors at the nearby university - in the 1,700 block of Herman Drive in Houston's Theater District about 4 a.m. Sunday in response to an assault in progress.

When police got to the 18th floor condo, Trujillo opened the door and let officers into the unit, which is where they found Andersson in a hallway between the entryway and the kitchen.

Authorities say he was stabbed multiple times, each time, apparently, with a stiletto shoe.

Trujillo was the only one present when the body was discovered.

Houston police tell ABC13 that Trujillo initially was cooperative with detectives, but later stopped talking as she was taken to a precinct for additional questioning.

Investigators say Trujillo doesn't live in the building and appears to have just been visiting. Hotel staff told authorities she appears to have arrived last night.

A motive for the slaying is unclear.

Trujillo is scheduled to be in Harris County District Court on Tuesday for her initial appearance. She currently is being held on $100,000 bond.
