Police have admitted the body of Etan Patz will probably never be found 33 years after he went missing, it was claimed today.

Sources said the New York Police Department have accepted Etan's parents, Julie and Stan, will never get the chance to bury the remains of their little boy.

It came as Etan's father Stan took a heartbreaking bicycle ride past the site where his six-year-old son was allegedly murdered in New York.

Mr Patz, who lives just a few blocks away, got on his bike in front of his SoHo building and pedaled past the eyeglass store that now occupies 448 West Broadway, the New York Post reported today.

The shop had been a bodega when Pedro Hernandez, who was aged 18 at the time and was a stock boy there, claims he stranged Etan.

The 51-year-old has told cops he killed Etan in the bodega's basement May 25, 1979, and threw his body out with the garbage at nearby 113 Thompson Street.

Hernandez claims to have lured the youngster to the store with the promise of soda and was charged with second degree murder.

Following his admission, New York's Sanitation Department is examining its archive to try to determine where the trash might have been dumped.

But a law-enforcement source told the New York Post  said that authorities 'are never going to undertake that kind of searching' if the trash was taken to a landfill.

The source added: 'It would cost millions of dollars. You're talking about hundreds of tons of garbage.'

Even with a search, 'You'd probably still never find that body.'

Etan's remains could have been taken to the massive Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island - which was taller than the Statue of Liberty when it closed in 2001.

The department is also believed to have dumped garbage in the Atlantic Ocean in 1979 and taken it to an incinerator - meaning there would be no remains.

Finding the body is crucial to examining Hernandez's claim. The Manhattan District Attorney's Office needs evidence other than Hernandez's confession to prosecute him, legal experts have said.

And so far there is no corroborating evidence, apart from from hearsay from some of his relatives and others that he told them years ago that he'd killed a child in New York, sources said.

Hernandez, who is reportedly schizophrenic and bipolar, is currently on suicide watch at New York's Bellevue Hospital.

The suspect's sister and a prayer group leader recently revealed Hernandez confessed to the murder during a prayer meeting in the 1980s.

Norma Hernandez said her brother admitted the killing during a gathering of charismatic Christians at St. Anthony of Padua, a Roman Catholic church in Camden, New Jersey.

Tomas Rivera, the group's leader, confirmed that he was present during the meeting, but felt he could not report the confession to police because it hadn't been made to him 'one on one'.

The pivotal meeting happened in the early 1980s, a few years after Etan’s 1979 disappearance, when Mr. Hernandez was in his early 20s.

The FBI and New York Police Department are at odds over whether Hernandez actually committed the notorious murder.

Inconsistencies in the bodega worker's confession have led the FBI to doubt his claims, and a police source told the New York Daily News the agency was 'very sceptical' and thought the police had moved too fast.

The paper claimed Hernandez has provided detectives with 'intimate details' about the case that only the real killer of the six-year-old could have known.

The exact details are not known, but could include information such as identifying characteristics on Patz’s body, including scars and birth marks, or the clothing he was wearing when he disappeared 33 years ago.

Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to second-degree murder, and the charge means prosecutors do not believe he had planned in advance to kill Etan.

The suspect reportedly told police he had never seen the six-year-old before the day he killed him, but then, 'I knew he was the one... [I] just felt the urge to kill.'

Now his family appears to have turned on the self-confessed killer, as his sister insisted that he should 'pay for what he did' if found guilty of second-degree murder.

Margarita Lopez said: 'If he did something he should pay for it. I have kids and if something happened to them the person that did it will have to pay.

'It doesn't matter if he's my son, my brother, my father or whatever. They would have to pay for what they did.'

As Hernandez confessed his crime to police, according to New York police chief Raymond Kelly, he seemed 'remorseful' and had a 'feeling of relief'. But he provided no motive for the killing.

Police say they consider Hernandez's signed confession to be reliable, having spent three and a half hours interviewing him.

Etan's parents, Julie and Stanley, who have never moved from the SoHo apartment where they lived at the time of his disappearance, were taken-aback when told of the admission, but are said to have handled it well.

The Patz family has always maintained that the culprit for their son's disappearance was convicted paedophile Jose Ramos.

Jailed for an unrelated crime, Ramos, 68, later told a prison cell mate he knew every stop of the bus route that took Etan to school and knew the six-year-old got off at the third stop.

He admitted to taking a boy back to his apartment to rape him on the day Etan disappeared, but he said he let the boy go. He said he was '90 per cent sure' it was the same boy he later saw on TV.

No hard evidence has linked him to the crime. He is now in a Pennsylvania jail on a 20-year sentence for abusing two boys and is due to be released in November.

Etan's father has previously said: 'Jose Antonio Ramos is the man who abducted my child. We lost our child to a paedophile, and that's not comprehensible.'

Convinced that Ramos is guilty of the crime, Mr Patz sends him a copy of his son's missing child poster twice a year, with the words 'What have you done with my little boy' written on the back.

However, police do not believe Etan was sexually assaulted before his death.

Etan's disappearance sparked an international manhunt in 1979, and May 25 - the last day he was seen alive - is now National Missing Children's Day in America.
