Britain's rail passengers are the victims of a ‘great train robbery’, a damning study concludes today.

They endure the highest fares in Europe while being squeezed into old and overcrowded carriages.

Meanwhile train company profits soar thanks to huge taxpayer subsidies.

The Manchester University report says privatisation has ‘failed to deliver’ for either passengers or taxpayers.

Britain's rail passengers are the victims of a 'great train robbery', a damning study concludes today

It says private train firms are heavily dependent on the public purse to enable them to run services, and re-invest little of their profits back into the railways.

According to the study for the Trades Union Congress, the train companies receiving the largest state subsidies spent, on average, more than 90 per cent of their profits on shareholder dividends.

It revealed that despite a 60 per cent increase in passengers since 1994-1995, there has only been a 3 per cent increase in the number of new carriages.

Report came as rail watchdogs revealed that Network Rail is on track for a £75million fine for failing to meet punctuality targets

Ministers hit back, insisting privatisation had ‘transformed’ an industry in decline while increased investment meant more than 2,000 new carriages were on order.

The report came as rail watchdogs revealed that Network Rail is on track for a £75million fine for failing to meet punctuality targets that will put it in breach of its licence.

Today’s highly critical 166-page report says report says train companies receiving the largest state subsidies spent, on average, over 90per cent of their profits on shareholder dividends.

They made operating profits between 2007 and 2011 of £504million, most of which was paid to shareholders, said the report.

Meanwhile passengers have endured higher fares and more overcrowding on older trains, says the study carried out for the Trades Union Congress (TUC) by the Centre for Research on Social-Cultural Change (CRESC) at the University of Manchester.

Long distance, day return and season tickets are all around twice the price of similar tickets in France, Germany, Italy and Spain, which have publicly-run rail systems, while average train fares in the UK increased at three times the rate of average wages between 2008 and 2012.

TUC general secretary Frances O’Grady said: ‘This study explodes the myth that rail firms are bringing added value to our railways. In reality they rely upon taxpayers to turn a profit, virtually all of which ends up in shareholders’ pockets, rather than being used to improve services.

‘Rail privatisation has not brought the improvements its cheerleaders promised - the average age of trains has increased and most new investment is funded by the state.’

She added: ‘The claim that private train operators are responsible for more people using the railways must also be taken with a huge pinch of salt.’

‘The Government must accept that the current model is broken. ‘

Professor Karel Williams who headed the research said: 'The privately-owned train operating companies have hijacked the government’s rail reform agenda which is all about ‘getting franchising back on track’.

But the Government rejected the report. A Department for Transport spokesman said: ‘We do not accept the TUC’s analysis of the rail industry. The fact is privatisation works. It has transformed an industry that was in decline into one that is providing record numbers of journeys for record numbers of passengers and is one of the safest in Europe.’

He added ministers were embarking on ‘the biggest programmes of rail investment ever’ including widespread electrification, more than over 2,000 new carriages and statin upgrades made possible only by Governments working closely with ‘an innovative private sector.’

Michael Roberts, chief executive of the Association of Train Operating Companies, said: ‘Britain’s railway has been transformed in the last 15 years, thanks to the public and private sectors working successfully together to deliver for passengers and taxpayers.’
