While many things are often described as looking good enough to eat, jellyfish aren't usually among them.

But while sailing around the Mediterranean recently, photographer Barry Bland came across one of the free-swimming marine animals - and was thrilled to find that it looked just like a fried egg.

With his trusty camera at the ready, Mr Bland took footage of the jellyfish, pulsating in all of its egg yolk-yellow glory as it floated amid a school of fish.

With bright blue balls of colour speckling its umbrella-shaped bell, the eye-catching sea creature alternated between resembling a decorative lamp and a welcome addition to a fry-up.

And, after shooting the footage, Mr Bland revealed that his meeting with the jellyfish was far from accidental, as he had previously read about it - and then went on a mission to track it down.

The photo-journalist, who has been sailing the world on a yacht with his family, said: 'I'd seen a picture of a Fried Egg Jellyfish on a National Geographic calendar and was amazed how cool they were.

The scientific name for the particular species of jellyfish is cotylorhiza tuberculata

'I decided to keep a close eye out for one when we were in the Mediterranean.'

The scientific name for the particular species of jellyfish is cotylorhiza tuberculata.

Mr Bland is a photojournalist who lives in St Albans, Hertfordshire, with more than 20 years experience both in Britain and abroad.

The Mediterranean Sea is one of the more common areas they're found, as well as the Aegean and Adriatic seas, given their need for a large concentration of sunlight to survive. 

And while they're stunning to look at, they're also considerably safer to be around than their counterparts, as their sting has very little or no effect on humans.
