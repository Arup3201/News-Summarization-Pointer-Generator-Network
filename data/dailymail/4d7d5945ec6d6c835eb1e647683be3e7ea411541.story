A woman has been accused of offering a friend 'with a past' $25,000 to kill her husband after he failed to give her money from the sale of a house.

Doreen Dufresne, 50, from Port Orange, Florida, has been released on bail after confessing to the plan, which she claims she regrets making.

Police added that they had no plans to probe the death of her second husband, who died after he swallowed anti-freeze in 2001.

Arrested: Police said Doreen Dufresne, 50, 
admitted to asking a friend to kill her estranged third husband for 
cash. The pair had fallen out over money

The death, which occurred after Lawrence Blackwood consumed the poison over an extended period of time, was classed as a suicide.

Dufresne asked her friend Brandon Parrish, who had a criminal history, if he could 'take care of' her estranged third husband, Neil Suchy, 70.

She told the fellow nurses aide she would be willing to give him the entirety of her husband's $25,000 life insurance policy, ABC News reported.

Horrified, Parrish told her he would find someone to act as a hit man - in order to stall Dufresne so he could alert police.

Honest: Dufresne asked Brandon Parrish, pictured, as he had a criminal history and she thought he would take up the offer - but he alerted police

'I just didn't want to go the rest of my life knowing I could have 
prevented someone from being killed,' Parrish told WFTV.

Dufresne had allegedly intended to kill her husband after he had sold their home for $72,000 but did not split the money with her as promised.

Parrish said she had told him that her husband of two years had hit her and molested her granddaughter.

She gave Parrish detailed instructions of where to find Suchy, what his truck looked like and directions to his home, Parrish told police.

Parrish immediately called Suchy, who then went to the police station.

Past: Police said Dufresne (pictured) will not be quizzed over her second husband, whose death was classed as suicide after he ingested antifreeze

Public records show he married Dufresne, whom he had known for more than 20 years, two months after his wife had died, ABC reported.

He claimed Dufresne had complained they had separate bank accounts and that he did not help support her daughter and two-year-old granddaughter.

When police visited her for questioning, Dufresne claimed she hadn't heard from her husband before changing her story to say she she had.

When police asked her about these contradictions, she said: 'Neil and I have been fighting a lot lately.'

She admitted she had asked Parrish to kill Suchy, police said, and was arrested on March 14 and charged with solicitation to commit murder.

Intentions: Dufresne, who lives with her daughter and granddaughter (above), allegedly gave Parrish detailed plans about where to find her husband

Dufresne told police she had asked Parrish for help as he was convicted of a sex crime in 1995 and she thought he would accept the offer.

It comes 11 years after Blackwood, Dufresne's second husband, was found dead in their home in New Hampshire.

An autopsy found he had died from consuming antifreeze 'over a period of time' and the death was ruled as suicide.

'Nothing suspicious in nature was found,' Robert Browne, a spokesperson for the Goffstown Police Department, told ABC News.

He added there were no plans to reopen the case.
