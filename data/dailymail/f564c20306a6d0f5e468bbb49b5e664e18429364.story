Francois Hollande was facing ridicule across France yesterday (sun) after posing in a ‘Borat-style’ traditional Kazakh fur hat and coat.

The hapless Socialist president had done everything possible to stop the photo being published, but now it has gone viral across the internet. 

It shows the 60-year-old head of state standing next to Nursultan Nazarbayev, the President of Kazakhstan.

Internet hit: The photo of Francois Hollande alongside Kazakh leader Nursultan Nazarbayev has been widely shared and mocked on social media

While Mr Nazarbayev is in a conventional blue suit and tie, Mr Hollande is wearing a white embroidered coat with fur trim, and a furry hat.

The clothes were a present from Mr Nazarbayev, who posted the photo on his official Instagram page on Friday, but it was quickly removed at the request of a furious Mr Hollande.  

Elysee aides said they had insisted that the image of the French president was not distributed.

Now, however, it is all over social media sites like Twitter and Facebook, with commentators saying Mr Hollande looks like the Sacha Baron Cohen character, ‘Borat’.

Comparison: Twitter users immediately likened the French president to Sasha Baron Cohen's Borat character

‘Mr Hollande is being ridiculed by almost everybody,’ said a Socialist party source. ‘Frankly, he doesn’t look very presidential in the photo’

‘Mr Hollande is being ridiculed by almost everybody,’ said a Socialist party source. ‘Frankly, he doesn’t look very presidential in the photo.’ 

It was in January that photographs of Mr Hollande wearing a crash helmet provoked the biggest crisis of his career.

They showed him sneaking out of a love nest close to the Elysee Palace following a night of passion with Juliet Gayet, a 42-year-old TV actress. 

The images directly led to Mr Hollande kicking his official first lady, Valerie Trierweiler, 49, out of the Elysee Palace.

Many commentators believe that any hope of Mr Hollande being re-elected as president again in 2017 are now all but over

Other photos he would rather forget: Francois Hollande poses for the camera during a visit to a school last year, and right, is targeted by a woman throwing flour during a speech in 2012

Ms Trierweiler has since written a kiss and tell book which has poured ridicule on Mr Hollande, whose popularity rating is now at a pitiful 12 per cent. 

He was portrayed by Ms Trierweiler as a lying love cheat and a hypocrite Socialist who secretly despises the poor. Meanwhile, the French economy is in crisis, with the unemployment rate spiralling well above three million.

Many commentators believe that any hope of Mr Hollande being re-elected as president again in 2017 are now all but over.

Parodies: Twitter users have been ridiculing the French president - with some creating mocked-up images of Mr Hollande in various fancy dress outfits
