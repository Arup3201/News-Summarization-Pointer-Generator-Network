Dramatic CCTV footage has emerged from Anhui Province, China of a rickshaw scraping unharmed through the middle of a crash at a crossroad in December. 

According to local reports the accident happened when a speeding truck ran a red light and crashed into a car from the other direction. 

As the two smashed and spun out of control the rickshaw can be seen passing through the dusty centre middle of the accident in a narrow escape. 

Police reportedly say the two drivers cheated death but were hospitalised after the incident that happened just days before Christmas.

The rickshaw comes only a matter of inches from colliding with the car, and then continues on its journey.

A scene at the end of the video shows the substantial damage caused to both vehicles - the side of the car is badly smashed in, while the front of the truck is in a similar state.

The truck was said to have sped through a red light causing the horror crash

There was no way the car could get out of the way, and thankfully there were no fatalities

The only good thing to come from the incident is the fact that there were no fatalities.

Only days later a truck swerved left then right on a bridge in a scene like a pinball machine after suffering a flat tyre.

This particular road smash occurred on the the Hangzhou Bay Bridge in Zhejiang Province on Christmas Eve. 

Despite crashing into both sides of the bridge, miraculously the driver escaped that time with a minor chin injury.
