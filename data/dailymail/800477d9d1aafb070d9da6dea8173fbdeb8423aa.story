Whether you’re the ‘nominated driver’, are avoiding drink for medical reasons or simply don’t fancy yet another hangover, sometimes staying sober is important – even on New Year’s Eve!

If I’m not drinking alcohol, I tend to sip apple juice topped up with sparkling water – or opt for a sparkling grape drink. In the past, I’ve steered well clear of de-alcoholised wine.

The process of removing the alcohol can result in the wine taking on a harsh edge of acidity, which can make it shocking to taste – and  leave it with a shocking price tag  to match.

Pop goes the sobriety! There are plenty of low-alcohol or completely sober alternatives that will not make you feel like you belong on the kids table on New Years Eve

But happily, methods have moved on – and today there are some very pleasant non-alcoholic booze options.

I’ve checked out the main offerings in the shops – and by far and away the winning category for me  is beer. I’d be happy to drink one of the alcohol-free lagers I tested.

And for those who enjoy a glass of something festive but are trying to be calorie-conscious, there are some extremely tasty low-alcohol wines.

Earlier this year I wrote about how I lost 4st by taking up running and choosing lower-alcohol wines – a large (250ml) glass of Californian zinfandel can be more than 14.5 per cent alcohol content, adding 228 calories to your dinner.

Stay on the straight: All these drinks are non-alcoholic of almost free of alcohol unless otherwise stated

Those with 11 to 13 per cent have at least 30 fewer calories per glass. With this in mind, here is my pick of the low and no per cent tipples .  .  .

WHICH WINES PACK THE MOST PUNCH

The more the grape sits in the sun the greater the fermentation and alcohol content. So South African and Californian wines are deadly, while German wines are more restrained. Check the alcohol by volume (ABV) on the label.

According to the charity Drinkaware, more than half of us plan to drink more in December than at any other time of the year

Of those, more than a quarter say Christmas is a time when they can drink as much alcohol as they like without feeling guilty

One in five of us say that they drink more in December because it is encouraged by friends, colleagues and family
