The U.S. Embassy in Guyana warned on Sunday that it had received 'unconfirmed threat information' about a regional airline's flights from the South American country to the United States on Monday.

The carrier at the center of the possibly security breach is Caribbean Airlines.

Americans have subsequently been told to avoid using the carrier until the issue is resolved.

The warning about the unconfirmed threats was posted on the embassy's website on Sunday.

However no specific details have been released.

It advised all U.S. citizens in Guyana to
 make alternate travel arrangements through Wednesday if they were 
planning on traveling home on flights with Caribbean Airlines.

The airline's representative for Guyana, Carl Stuart, said the company has elevated 'our level of security involving the police, the military and other agencies'.

'We have been on this since Friday,' he told The Associated Press.

'We are on top of this and flights will continue as normal, but we are taking no chances.'

Cheddi Jagan International Airport issued a statement saying that, after being informed of the possible threat, it and the government's Public Works Ministry called a meeting involving security agencies and others to assess the situation.

Authorities 'adopted the highest security posture to protect passengers, crew, aircraft and airport employees and to ensure the continued smooth and safe operations at the airport,' the statement said.

In 2007, a former member of Guyana's parliament and a naturalized U.S. citizen from Guyana were among four people convicted of participating in a failed plot by a small group of militant Muslims to firebomb John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York.
