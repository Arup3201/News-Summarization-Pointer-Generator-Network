A man from North Carolina who played the lottery every day since his wife's death, believes his winning is a sign from beyond the grave.

David Greeson would choose the same numbers in the daily Fantasy 5 draw because the numbers represented special dates in the calendar: his wife's birthday and their anniversary.

After feeling down-on-his-luck after her sudden death, his recent win has given him a new lease of life and a fresh outlook on life.

The love of his life: David Greeson's wife Kathy Lynn died last December - he has thought about her every day since and played the lottery too

So happy together: David and Kathy were married for 26 years before she died from lymphoma

Lucky number: David played the same numbers for three months, every night, before they eventually came up

David already felt as though he had won the lottery when he married his wife Kathy Lynn in 1987.

She
 was the love of his life, but when she passed away unexpectedly at the 
end of last year, after 26 years of marriage, it felt as though his 
world had fallen apart.

He 
spent his days thinking of the times they shared together at their home 
in North Carolina and feeling a little down on his luck, so he decided to 
play the lottery.

David picked numbers that were near and dear to his heart.

He went for 5, 7, 11, 23, 31.

Like many who play the game, the numbers had a special significance for him because they reminded him of his love for Kathy.

'Her birthday was 11/23/57 and we were married on the 31st of October. Since her passing on December 6th, I've played those numbers every night. 5 , 7, 11, 23, 31.'

Jackpot! David won $77,922 and says that he will use the money to go traveling and revisit some of the places he went to with his wife

Mr Greeson loves playing the game and usually plays several times a week.

For the last three months, ever since his wife died, he has played the numbers every single night.

Finally, his numbers came up.

'I looked on my phone, punched up fantasy 5, and seen 5, 7, 11, 23, 35, and first thing I said was 'Kathy, our numbers hit' he told WTVC

Kathy's death came suddenly. She died within a couple weeks of being diagnosed with lymphoma cancer.

Mr Greeson says he will use $77,000 in prizeÂ  money to travel and resvisit some of the places where he and his best friend created so many wonderful memories.

He believes his win was in fact a sign from her that wherever she is, she is ok.
