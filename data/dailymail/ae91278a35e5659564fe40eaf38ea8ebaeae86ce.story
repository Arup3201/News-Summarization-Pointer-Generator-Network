Joined by thousands of mourners, the mothers of three Israeli teenagers murdered on their way home from school saw their bodies laid to rest yesterday.

Eyal Yifrach, 19, and 16-year-olds Naftali Fraenkel and Gilad Shaar are believed to have been shot dead in the backseat of a car after one of them managed to call police and whisper: 'We've been kidnapped.'

Their abductors shot them during the phone call, it is believed, fearing security forces would find them.

In fact, officers thought the call was a prank and the alarm was not raised for another seven hours, according to local reports.

Mourners turned out in force in Modi'in, a city 20 miles southeast of Tel Aviv.

Naftali's father Avraham declared: 'There hasn't been a show of unity like this in Israel for years.'

Laid on stretchers and wrapped in blue and white Israeli flags, the bodies were to be laid to rest together in the central Israeli town of Modiin.

The services were held as it was reported investigators were looking into whether the teenagers were murdered after one of the boys called the police.

Force: A huge ball of fire is seen following an Israel airstrike in Rafah, southern Gaza in the early hours of this morning.

Aggresive crackdown: Israeli soldiers (pictured) have since arrested a number of Palestinians linked to the Islamist group Hamas in the West Bank since the boys' deaths

Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon issued a statement this morning vowing to find those behind the killings.

'We
 see Hamas responsible for the kidnappings and murders. We will continue
 to pursue the murderers of the teens and will not rest until we lay our
 hands on them,' he said.

Mr
 Zaghah, who was killed in the early hours of this morning while police 
carried out a raid, is the first casualty of the increased tension 
between Israelis and Palestinians. Reports say he had thrown a grenade at Israeli soldiers before he was shot.

A
 military spokesman meanwhile said aircraft struck 34 targets across 
Gaza overnight after more than 20 rockets were fired into Israel since 
late Sunday from the Palestinian territory.

Grief: Israelis mourn and light candles in Rabin Square in Tel Aviv shortly after yesterday's announcement that the bodies of the three missing Israeli teenagers were found

The discovery of the three boys' bodies lead to an outpouring of grief across Israel - not least in Tel Aviv,  where of large gathering of mostly teenagers lit candles and displayed the Israeli flag

In an operation codenamed 'Brother's Keeper,' Israel dispatched thousands of troops across the West Bank in search of the youths, closed roads in the Hebron area and arrested some 400 Hamas operatives throughout the territory. 

Israel stepped up its crackdown on Palestinians linked to Hamas following the discovery of the teenagers' bodies last night.

The
 boys’ disappearance while hitchhiking a fortnight ago triggered one of 
the country’s biggest ever manhunts.

Now the grim find near the city of 
Hebron seems certain to increase Israel's aggression against the Palestinian militant group, 
which has its power base in the Gaza Strip

Hamas
 spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri warned against escalation, saying that if 
Netanyahu 'brings a war on Gaza, the gates of hell will open to him.'

Within hours of the teenagers' bodies being found, the Israeli army set off a huge explosion in the home of one of the suspects Amar Abu-Eisha. Here Abu-Eisha's relatives inspect the damage to the property

Both Amer Abu-Eisha and his co-suspect Marwan Kawasmeh appear to have gone missing, with Israel claiming they are on the run. In the early hours of this morning, Israel's army detonated a large device in the former's home (pictured) causing extensive damage

Location: Israeli soldiers stand near the area where the three Israeli teenagers' bodies were found yesterday. The rural track is just outside the village of Halhul, a few miles north of the West Bank city of Hebron

Now that the boys' bodies have been found, Israel has threatened to 'make Hamas pay' for their deaths. Israeli soldiers (pictured) have since arrested a number of Palestinians linked to the Islamist group in the West Bank

Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today 
programme this morning, Ron Dermer, Israel’s ambassador to United 
States, said: ‘For the last 18 days we have been praying that these boys
 were returned safe and sound and it has hit the country hard to find 
out that they were kidnapped and murdered.

‘We
 have had rockets fired at us so I wouldn’t have said it is retaliation.
 This is a Hamas action and it was perpetrated by Hamas. Hamas calls for
 the murder of Jews worldwide and now it’s done this. Israel’s 
government has made the decision to protect its population,' he added.

‘Hamas
 has not taken responsibility for its actions. But they are celebrating 
on the streets, praising it and calling for more and more 
kidnappings...‘We are talking about a terrorist organisation. It is no 
different to ISIS or Al Qaeda,' Mr Dermer went on to day.

‘I’m 
sure the United States will support us in fighting terrorism. They are 
doing it thousands of miles away, we are doing it on our doorsteps,' he 
added.

Israel has released 
no further details on its missile targets, but in recent weeks has 
repeatedly hit launch sites and weapons storage areas in similar 
attacks.

Suspects: The Israeli Defense Force had named Marwan Kawasmeh (right) and Amar Abu-Eisha (left) as the teen's kidnappers in an announcement made last Thursday. They are still allegedly on the run

Destroyed: Relatives of Amer Abu Eishe - a Hamas member named by Israel as one of the two prime suspects in the teenagers' murder -  inspect his house in Hebron after it was blown up by Israeli army this morning

Shattered: A relative inspects the house of Amer Abu Eishe - a member of the Islamist group Hamas, who is one of two men suspected of killing the boys. The Israeli air force destroyed Eishe's property this morning

Relatives: Family members gather outside the house of Amer Abu Eishe after it was virtually destroyed by an explosion detonated by the Israeli army in the early hours of this morning

Discovery: Israeli soldiers patrol close to the area where the bodies of the three Israeli teenagers were found

There have been no immediate reports of casualties.

Netanyahu, who earlier yesterday held Hamas responsible for the new rocket strikes from Gaza, convened his security cabinet to consider moves against the Islamist group, which has neither confirmed nor denied Israel's allegations about the kidnapping.

The senior ministers ended their late-night session without taking any final decisions and plan to reconvene later on Tuesday, a government official said.

'Netanyahu's threats against Gaza and against Hamas do not frighten us,' the movement's Gaza-based leader, Ismail Haniyeh, was quoted as saying by its Al-Quds television station.
