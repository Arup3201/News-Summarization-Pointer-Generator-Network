Miley's sudden illness has forced her to cancel a second show in as many weeks, after fans in Charlotte, North Carolina on Monday were left disappointed when she cancelled just 30 minutes before show time on April 8th.

The 21-year-old singer was diagnosed with flu and told to rest by doctors, according to a message on the Time Warner Cable arena's website but some concertgoers had already arrived for the Bangerz tour date before the announcement, only to be turned away.

Miley was scheduled to perform at the Sprint Center in Kansas City on Tuesday night, but the show was cancelled due to her hospitalisation.

The singer has been placed on medical rest by doctors, according to the statement, with no indication as yet given when she will resume the tour.

Refunds were being offered at the point of ticket purchase with online and phone orders being automatically refunded.

The singer has been sick lately and tweeted on Sunday and on Monday about flu-like symptoms. It is the latest blow for Miley, who is still grieving the death of her beloved dog Floyd.

The Alaskan Klee Kai is believed to have been attacked by a coyote last week in Los Angeles, while Miley was on tour.
