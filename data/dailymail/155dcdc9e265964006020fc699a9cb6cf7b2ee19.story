Thousands of Britons face a second day of travel chaos after the biggest storm in the US history forced airlines to make another round of flight cancellations.

As Hurricane Sandy closed in on the East Coast of the US, British Airways announced that it had cancelled dozens of services scheduled for Tuesday, including flights between London and New York.

Virgin Atlantic has cancelled two early morning flights from New York to London that were scheduled for Tuesday. A third Virgin flight from New York's JFK airport, scheduled to arrive at London Heathrow at 6.20am on Wednesday, will also not run.

The airline said it would continue to review the situation, making further cancellations likely.

It comes after tens of thousands of 
holidaymakers were left stranded on both sides of the Atlantic when 
dozens of flights to and from East Coast states were cancelled on 
Monday.

Britons could be 
left in the US for days as flights back to London and Manchester have 
been cancelled and those with trips booked during the half-term school 
holidays are being told they cannot fly to US destinations.

(Details correct at 8.45pm on Monday)

The route between the East Coast of the US and Western Europe is one of the busiest in the world.

More than 2.6million passengers flew 
from New York's JFK Airport to Heathrow in London last year - an average
 of more than 7,100 per day.

On average, almost 14,200 passengers fly from JFK to London, Paris, Madrid and Frankfurt each day.

At 8.15pm on Monday, BA's flight information website showed that the airline had cancelled 15 of its London-bound flights that had been scheduled to depart from New York airports on Tuesday.

A further 14 flights in the opposite direction had been cancelled.

A return flight between JFK and Manchester also fell victim to the conditions.

In a statement, the airline said: 'Customer safety with regards to Hurricane Sandy remains our highest priority and following advice from the US authorities we have decided to cancel 11 return flights to and from the East Coast of the US on Tuesday.

'We are doing all we can to help customers whose flights have been cancelled and will look to use larger aircraft on some routes when the full flying schedule resumes to help get customers to their correct destination as quickly as we can.

'The cancellations include some flights to New York JFK, Newark, Washington, Baltimore and Philadelphia.

'Customers should continue to check ba.com for the very latest information.'

A spokesman for Virgin Atlantic said: ‘Details of 
arrangements for affected passengers, including rebooking and extended 
hotel-stay compensation can be found on our website.

'Our
 flights to America had been very busy at the beginning of this week due
 to the half-term school holiday. It's very unfortunate that this major 
storm has come when it has.’

The spokesman said that all the airline's flights scheduled 
for Tuesday were scheduled to operate, except for two breakfast 
flights in the morning from New York to London.

However, the airline is continuing to review the situation, the spokesman added.

On Monday, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic cancelled all of their flights between London Heathrow and the East
 Coast including New York, Baltimore, Washington, Boston and 
Philadelphia.

The hurricane is expected to affect up to 50million people, forcing
 the shutdown of transport networks, schools and financial markets in 
New York City and beyond, sending coastal residents fleeing for higher 
ground, and threatening a dangerous mix of high winds, heavy rain and a 
surging 11ft wall of water.

The storm has grown to 1,000 
miles wide and was said to be increasing in speed as it hurtled towards New Jersey.

New York was expected to 
feel the effects this evening. The storm was expected to peak late on Monday before subsiding in the early hours of Tuesday.

Vincent McAviney, 24, from London, was due to be 
travelling to Washington but his flight was cancelled.

‘I was meant to be flying to DC this 
morning at 11 for a holiday but last night I checked my flight status at
 7.30 and it was listed as cancelled,’ he said. ‘I called them again 
this morning when the lines opened. I managed to get through after being
 on hold for 25 minutes.

'So I rearranged for the first available flight, which is Thursday.
 Looking at the pictures and the forecasts it seems like a fair enough 
decision. I'm obviously disappointed that my holiday has been shortened 
but it's nature, so there's not much we can do about it.’

Heathrow had a total of 59 flights cancelled on Monday - 47 flights to New York 
and 12 inbound flights from the US.

The airport advised passengers
 to check the status of their flight with their airline before 
travelling.

A Heathrow spokesman said: ‘Fifty-nine flights have been cancelled today - 12 arrivals 
and 47 departures to and from East Coast destinations.

'The
 number of cancelled flights could still go up but many of the 
cancellations are for flights scheduled throughout the day.'

The spokesman added that the hurricane had also caused disruption on Sunday.

Four flights due to arrive at Heathrow on that day were cancelled, as well as 11 departures.

Britons living in New York described people stocking up on supplies for when the storm hits.

Divya Samtani, 22, from London, said: 'Everyone is freaking out. Flashlights are sold out everywhere, queues are really long in the supermarkets and all the hardware shops are closed.

'We're all kind of hanging in there and waiting.'

Novelist Philip Hensher, 47, from Sheffield, said the main fear was of power cuts, with doormen taking ladders into lifts in case they break down.

Asset Tarabayev, 26, a quantitative software developer, also originally from London, said New York was 'cut off from the outside world', and Debbie Dreyfuss, 22, who is studying at New York University, said: 'The city is completely dead.'
