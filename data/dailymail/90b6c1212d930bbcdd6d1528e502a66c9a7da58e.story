A former lead detective in the Oscar Pistorius murder investigation has been accused of telling 'blatant lies' to incriminate the athlete.

In his closing arguments at the murder trial, the Paralympian's lawyer Barry Roux claimed Hilton Botha had given contradictory evidence at the runner's bail hearing last year.

Mr Roux also attacked the prosecution for not calling the disgraced police officer to give evidence.

Mr Botha quit the investigation after it was revealed he was facing manslaughter charges in a separate case.

Oscar Pistorius leaves court after the first day of closing arguments by the defence and prosecution

Earlier, chief prosecutor Gerrie Nel 
used his closing arguments to accuse of Pistorius of repeatedly lying 
during his testimony in a crude attempt to defend the murder charge.

Alluding to his career as a track star, Mr Nel the athlete had 'dropped the baton of truth'.

Mr
 Nel cited flaws in the defense, saying the Paralympian's legal team 
floated more than one theory about what happened on the night that 
Pistorius shot Reeva Steenkamp through a closed toilet door in his home.

Defense lawyers had argued
 that Pistorius fired in self-defense, fearing an intruder, Mr Nel said,
 but they also raised the possibility that he was not criminally 
responsible and accidentally shot because he was 'startled.'

'It's
 two defenses that you can never reconcile,' Mr Nel said as Pistorius 
sat behind him in the dock, occasionally flicking through documents.

The amputee appeared calm in contrast to past occasions when he vomited and wailed in the dock

The
 once-celebrated double-amputee appeared calm, in contrast on past 
occasions during which he retched, vomited and wailed in the dock in 
apparent distress.

The 
prosecution has argued that Pistorius intentionally shot Steenkamp 
before dawn on Valentine's Day last year after a fierce row and claimed 
he knew she was in the bathroom.

Mr
 Nel ended his closing argument by saying Pistorius was guilty of 
pre-meditated murder because he then 'made up his mind' to find his gun,
 walk through to the bathroom and shoot.

'That, my lady, is pre-planning,' Nel said to the judge.

Deliberation: Pistorius speaks with a member of his legal team ahead of the final arguments of his murder trial

Yet
 Mr Nel said Pistorius should still be convicted of murder even if the 
court accepts he did not know it was Steenkamp in the toilet cubicle, 
arguing the athlete intentionally shot at and killed a person with no 
reason to believe his life was under threat.

Barry Roux, the chief defense lawyer, listened and checked files as Mr Nel spoke for hours.

Mr
 Nel was occasionally questioned by Judge Thokozile Masipa and urged to 
speed up elaborations on written arguments of more than 100 pages that 
were submitted to the court last week.

Mr
 Roux began his final arguments before Masipa postponed proceedings 
until Friday for the defense to finish. Masipa will then adjourn the 
trial to deliberate with two legal assistants on a verdict.

Pistorius faces 25 years to life in prison if convicted on the main charge of premeditated murder.

Mr Roux noted that some of the evidence at the scene, which Nel referred to, had been moved around by investigators.

'We're not talking about a conspiracy,' Roux said, calling it unintentional tampering.

Mr
 Roux also noted that Hilton Botha, the former chief investigating 
officer in the case, had acknowledged mistakes in police procedure but 
was not called by the state as a trial witness.

According
 to Mr Nel, Pistorius was vague in allegations that police had possibly 
tampered with evidence around the scene of the shooting, including fans 
and a bed cover strewn on the floor of his bedroom.

It
 was also improbable that the athlete, in his version, rushed with his 
gun to investigate a purported sound in the bathroom without first 
trying to talk to Miss Steenkamp and confirm that she was safe, the 
prosecutor said.

'We cannot
 argue that he was the worst witness ever, that honour belongs to 
someone else,' said the prosecution's written argument.

'The accused was, however, demonstrably one of the worst witnesses ever encountered.'

The
 prosecution said Pistorius also 'used well-calculated and rehearsed 
emotional outbursts to deflect the attention and avoid having to answer 
questions.'

A psychologist 
who examined Pistorius during a court-ordered observation period 
concluded that the athlete had become severely traumatised since the 
killing and could become an increasing suicide risk unless he continues 
to get mental health care.

The
 fathers of the Olympic runner and Steenkamp, a model and television 
personality, were in the Pretoria courtroom for the first time since the
 trial began in early March.

Support: Pistorius's father Henke (above) also made his first appearance at the trial

They sat at opposite ends of a long bench 
in the gallery. Pistorius is said to be estranged from his father, 
Henke, and Steenkamp's father, Barry, has been ill.

Pistorius's
 older brother Carl, who has regularly attended court sessions, was in 
an intensive care unit in a South African hospital and was on a 
ventilator because of injuries suffered in a serious car crash last 
week, the Pistorius family said in a statement.

In addition to the murder charge, Pistorius faces three separate gun-related charges. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.

Because
 South Africa has no trial by jury, Judge Masipa will decide if 
Pistorius committed murder, is guilty of a negligent killing, or if he 
made a tragic error and should be acquitted. The runner also would be 
sent to prison for years if guilty of murder without premeditation or 
culpable homicide.

Masipa told Nel and Roux that they had only until the end of Friday to complete their final arguments in court.

'Unless, of course, you want to work on a Saturday and perhaps Sunday, after church,' she said, smiling.
