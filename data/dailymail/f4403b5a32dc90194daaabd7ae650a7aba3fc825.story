Rookie NFL quarterback Johnny Manziel, who’s been enjoying a summer of non-stop partying since signing with the Cleveland Browns in May, looks to have found himself a girlfriend who is more than up to the challenge of matching his hard partying ways.

Colleen Crowley, an undergrad at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth, Texas, has been spotted regularly with Manziel since the pair attended a Drake concert together last month.

Earlier this month, the former Heisman Trophy winner and the Houston socialite were also spotted together at a Boston Red Sox game at Fenway Park together.

Since Cleveland picked him up Manziel in May's draft, the 21-year-old has been living it up like a rock star and Crowley has been a fixture of his jet-setting, nightlife-embracing summer tour for the past month.

Now it looks like things could be getting pretty serious if the lovebirds respective Instagram accounts are anything to go by.

In the last day or so, both Manziel and Crowley have shared intimate photos of them kissing and hugging each other.

The pair appear to have much in common, including that they are both Texans. Crowley hails from Houston, while Manziel is originally from about three hours drive away in Tyler.

Crowley also enjoys having a good time if her Instagram pics are another to go by, in particular the photo of her shot gunning a beer

Dating athletes also appears to run in her family, as twin sister Robyn is seeing NBA forward Chandler Parsons, who recently moved from the Houston Rockets to the Dallas Mavericks.

Manziel’s summer of fun is set to come to an abrupt end on Thursday when his team’s training camp officially gets underway and his bid to become the starting quarterback finally starts.

The sports star, who revels in his nickname Johnny Football, has drawn flak from many over his unashamed love of the high life.

Browns coach Mike Pettine said this week that he has spoken to Manziel about his capacity to make headlines for what he does of the park.

Yet Manziel's larger than life personality is good for business and has helped make him the best-selling jersey in the NFL this spring.

Manziel's No. 2 Browns jersey is the NFL Shop's top-selling jersey through the first portion of 2014's fiscal year, beating out Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson.
