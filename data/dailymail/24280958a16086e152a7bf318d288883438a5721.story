Never mind heat wave, how's this for a brain wave: an Illinois-based design company has created a paw-activated water fountain for dogs.

The Doggie Fountain, dubbed Koolinator, attaches to a standard garden hose and provides thirsty pets with a supply of fresh running water to help them keep cool in hot weather.

It can also be used in place of a water bowl to make sure your pets are not left without a drink when you're at work, especially with the hot temperatures set to continue.

Once a dog learns to press the Doggie Fountain paddle with its paw, the gadget can be used to replace a water bowl for when owners are at work or out of the house and can't keep the bowl topped up

Allied Precision Industries which invented the gadget said: 'Owners can just simply attach the innovative dog water dispenser to the end of their garden hose.

'When your dog steps on the paw switch, a stream of fresh drinking water is released.

'As a bonus you get to teach your pet a new trick and once it gets a hang of it you will be free of the task of filling its water bowl.

'The dog will finally able to enjoy a cool, refreshing drink of water whenever it feels like it.'

The Doggie Fountain costs £45 and can be bought online.

Another gadget recently invented to help tackle the rising temperatures across the UK is the desktop humidifier.

The Mini Mister sits on the top of a standard bottle of water, draws the liquid up through a detachable 12cm-long tube, and sprays water vapour into the air, meaning the room is kept cool and fresh.

This gadget creates around 30ml of 
vapour per hour and can be used in the office, in the car or even to 
cool down a bedroom overnight.

When the Mini Mister is fitted to a 500ml bottle of water, right, it will last around eight hours. It can also be used on smaller bottles and comes in three colours - red, silver and blue

Designed by South Korean company Amazing Grace, the device can be charged using a laptop or phone charger via a USB-to-mini-USB cable.

The tubular core doubles as a water filter, too. 

And, once the summer months are over, the humidifier can double us as an aroma defuser for aromatherapy oils and perfumes.

It comes with two cores, which must be replaced every three months, and costs £22.50.
