'Low self-esteem': Rebecca Raymond was sacked from the boarding school she taught at after asking for maternity leave

A private girls’ school which sacked a pregnant art teacher to ‘avoid wasting money on maternity pay’ was yesterday ordered to pay her almost £34,000 in compensation.

Rebecca Raven said she was made to feel like an ‘irresponsible teenager’ after telling the headmistress that she wanted to take maternity leave.

When she complained, Robbie Locke, one of the trustees at Howell’s School in Denbigh, North Wales, told her: ‘Maternity leave is very disruptive to businesses and has made businesses go bust.

‘We already have a staff member who has worked only four weeks this year and has already been paid for a full year. This cannot happen again.’

An employment tribunal had previously ruled that Mrs Raven, 32, was unfairly sacked from her £23,295 post.

At yesterday’s hearing, held to determine her payout, the mother-of-three broke down in tears as she revealed the impact her dismissal had had on her.

She said it had affected her pregnancy and her self-image had been reduced from that of a grown-up woman to an ‘irresponsible teenager’.

Employment Judge Donald Thompson said: ‘This is a serious case of failure. There was no appeal, you were dismissed in the middle of a meeting and you did not have representation.’

Earlier Mrs Raven had told the 
hearing: ‘I was shocked and upset at my employment being terminated as I
thoroughly enjoyed my job, regularly going above and beyond the call of
duty to the benefit of the school.

‘I
was unable to eat properly for several months after that date as a 
result of the stress which meant my pregnancy weight gain was very slow.

‘I
was left feeling irresponsible and with low self-esteem because I was 
being put in a position where I was unable to care for my present 
children as well as I should, let alone a new baby.’

When Mrs Raven complained, Robbie Locke, one of the trustees at Howell's School in Denbigh, North Wales, (pictured) told her: 'Maternity leave is very disruptive to businesses'

Mrs Raven, of Flint, North Wales, was sacked from the boarding school, which charges fees of £21,000 a year, eight days after asking Emma Jones, the acting headmistress, for maternity leave.

At a subsequent meeting with Mr Locke, she was told: ‘Because I would have to pay you maternity, other areas of the school will miss out. Money has been wasted in the past on sick pay and maternity pay.’

Mrs Raven told yesterday’s hearing: ‘The meeting with Mr Locke was an awful experience.

'He was verbally aggressive and his comments made me feel worthless. During that meeting I felt victimised because I had decided to extend my family.

‘I felt that my reputation as a committed and professional teacher had been damaged.’

According to the tribunal ruling, the school’s financial position was ‘extremely precarious’ at the time, with pupil numbers down a third, and Mr Locke – one of four trustees – was having to subsidise it from his own pocket to the tune of £25,000 a month.

Mrs Raven’s compensation included a basic award of £800, £1,318 for loss of maternity pay, future loss of earnings of £14,355, loss of statutory rights of £250 and injury to feelings of £7,500.
