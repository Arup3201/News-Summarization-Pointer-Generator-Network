A new bride forgot that she was married just two months after her wedding following a freak brain injury that nearly took her life.

Tunicia Hall, 43, from Queens, was rushed to hospital complaining of a terrible headache just weeks after her wedding to husband Raleigh.

It was discovered that she was bleeding around her brain from what doctors call an 'uncommon' type of brain hemorrhage, and  was immediately taken to the Intensive Care Unit.

Doctors managed to save Tunicia, but Raleigh, 50, realized that his new wife had lost some of her memory, not knowing what year it was, how old she was or even that the couple were married.

'I felt like I lost her,' Raleigh, a recording artist, told NBC New York.

After two days Raleigh decided that he had to do something to help his wife, so he plastered her room at North Shore LIJ in New York with  pictures of their recent wedding day.

'I remember my husband was going around the room putting up the pictures. I don't know why he was putting up the pictures. I was just watching him,' Tunicia told ABC7.

'She started coming around and it drew questions about when were we married? And are we married?,' Raleigh added.

Thanks to the photos, Tunicia slowly began to recover her memory as her health improved. she is now  home with her husband and undergoing physical therapy.

She said the process of recovering her memory was gradual, but she feels well now and is in no pain.

This week the hospital helped the Halls celebrate their three month anniversary with cake just a few floors below the intensive care unit where Raleigh Hall spent weeks at his wife’s bedside.

Although a great deal of medical care went into Tunicia's recovery, the doctors acknowledged how important the photographs were in helping to bring back her memory.

'It's not just medical science that's bringing patients back,' said Dr Richard Temes, North Shore University Hospital neurocritical care director. 'Patients' families are so important and key in terms of neurological recovery.'
