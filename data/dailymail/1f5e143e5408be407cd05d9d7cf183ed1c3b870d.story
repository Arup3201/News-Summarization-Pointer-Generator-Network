The Man Booker prize longlist was revealed today with American authors in the running for one of literature's top honours for the first time.

David Mitchell, David Nicholls and past winner Howard Jacobson are all among the authors vying for the prestigious award, as its new global embrace gives fewer than half the places to British writers.

A rule change has now opened the award to more international writers, enabling Americans to be included for the first time with four U.S. authors among the list of 13 announced.

The remaining places go to Australian Richard Flanagan and two Irish writers Joseph O’Neill - who lives in New York - and Niall Williams.

They would have been eligible under the previous rules which allowed authors from the Commonwealth and the Republic of Ireland.

Organisers of the UK’s best-known fiction award - worth £50,000 to the winner - announced last year they were opening up the 46-year-old prize to writers of any nationality writing in English.

Among the Brits in contention is Paul Kingsnorth whose debut novel The Wake, written in his own made-up language based on Old English - was published by independent publisher Unbound after being financed through online crowdfunding.

Past winner: Howard Jacobson, who won the Man Booker in 2010 for his novel The Finkler Question, has made the longlist again with his new work J

The
 list features celebrated writer David Nicholls, whose novels One Day 
and Starter For 10 were adapted into movie hits, with his latest work Us
 earning him a place.

David Mitchell - in the running for his book The Bone Clocks - and Ali Smith - represented by her novel How To Be Both - have each made the shortlist on two previous occasions.

Jacobson, who won the Booker in 2010 for The Finkler Question, has made the 2014 longlist for his book J.

The other British writer to be included by the six-strong judging panel, chaired by AC Grayling, is Calcutta-born Neel Mukherjee for The Lives Of Others.

Joshua Ferris (US) - To Rise Again at a Decent Hour

Richard Flanagan (Australia) - The Narrow Road to the Deep North

Karen Joy Fowler (US) - We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves

Howard Jacobson (Britain) - J

Paul Kingsnorth (Britain) - The Wake

David Mitchell (Britain) - The Bone Clocks

Neel Mukherjee (Britain) - The Lives of Others

David Nicholls (Britain) - Us

Joseph O’Neill (Ireland) - The Dog

Richard Powers (US) - Orfeo

Ali Smith (Britain) - How to Be Both

Niall Williams (Ireland) - History of the Rain

But it is the inclusion of American writers for the first time which will fuel much of the discussion about this year’s list.

The tipped Donna Tartt book The Goldfinch failed to make it, but To Rise Again At A Decent Hour author Joshua Ferris, Karen Joy Fowler who wrote We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves, Siri Hustvedt's The Blazing World and Orfeo by Richard Powers have all made the list.

'This is a diverse list of ambition, experiment, humour and artistry,' Mr Grayling said of the nominees.

'The novels selected are full of wonderful stories and fascinating characters.

'The judges were impressed by the high quality of writing and the range of issues tackled - from 1066 to the future, from a PoW camp in Thailand, to a dentist’s chair in Manhattan, from the funny to the deeply serious, sometimes in the same book.'

The announcement last year that the Booker was dropping its geographical borders came in the wake of the launch of the Folio Prize - seen by many as a rival award - which attracted an international field.

There were also changes to the number of books which publishers could enter.

Jonathan Taylor, who chairs the Booker Prize Foundation, said: 'Our new model, in recognising literary achievement, should encourage the traditional publishing houses while ensuring novels from new green-shoot publishers continue to be included.

'By
 including writers from around the world to compete alongside 
Commonwealth and Irish writers, the Man Booker Prize is reinforcing its 
standing as the most important literary award in the English-speaking 
world.'

Salman
 Rushdie - who won the prize in 1981 for Midnight’s Children - said of 
the expansion of entry: 'I think it’s a really great thing that finally 
we’ve got an English-language prize that doesn’t make a distinction for 
writers who are writing from a particular country.'

Last year’s prize was won by New Zealander Eleanor Catton, who became the youngest victor at the age of 28 and her book The Luminaries, at 832 pages, was also the longest winner.

Missing out: Donna Tartt's hotly tipped The Goldfinch failed to make the prize's longlist

Kingsnorth, a former deputy editor of The
 Ecologist, has previously written non-fiction books which have included
 an examination of the negative impact of globalisation as well as 
poetry.

He has said of The Wake: 'I constructed, 
almost by accident, my own language: a middle ground between the Old 
English that would have been spoken by these characters and the English 
we speak today.

'The result is a book which is written in a tongue that no-one has ever spoken, but which is intended to project a ghost image of the speech patterns of a long-dead land: a place at once alien and familiar.'

Bookmaker William Hill makes O’Neill the favourite to take the prize at 4/1, while Mitchell is the top British hope at 5/1 second favourite.

It puts Flanagan at 6/1, Smith 7/1, Jacobson and Powers at 8/1, Fowler and Williams on 9/1, while Mukherjee and Nicholls are 10/1 and Ferris, Hustvedt and Kingsnorth are at 20/1.

'After all the fears about a US-dominated list, the number of British writers comes as a surprise, although the absence of any authors from Africa or Asia is perhaps the more striking aspect of the spread of nationalities,' said Jonathan Ruppin, of Foyles bookshops.

'The omissions of Donna Tartt’s The Goldfinch and Ian McEwan’s The Children Act are indications of what an outstanding year for fiction 2014 is turning out to be.

'I doubt anyone would have predicted the appearance of Karen Joy Fowler or David Nicholls, but their books are by no means the only longlisted ones with the potential to appeal to very broad readership.'

He added: 'With more well-known than most years, sales should be very strong. David Mitchell will probably be the favourite, and he’d make a very deserving winner - but Richard Flanagan is probably the dark-horse bet.'
