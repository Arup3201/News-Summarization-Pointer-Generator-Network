It looks like Newcastle have captured the summer signing they always dreamed of when Cheryl Cole turned up for the X Factor auditions in Gateshead.

The former Girls Aloud singer, back on her home patch, was given a Newcastle shirt by a waiting fan with her name 'Miss Cheryl' on the back.

Newcastle have a knack for signing French players but the closest Cole comes to meeting that criteria is through her boyfriend, Jean-Bernard Fernandez-Versini.

It is not the only signing Newcastle have made this summer, thankfully for their patient supporters.

Ayoze Perez became the first, signing from Tenerife for £1.5million.

The more noticeable, though, was Jack Colback who, on a free, signed from North East rivals Sunderland.
