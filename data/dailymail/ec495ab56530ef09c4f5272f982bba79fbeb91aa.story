This is the shocking moment a woman who got out of her car after spinning out of control on an icy road was sent flying 50 feet through the air by a passing motorist. 

Alevtina Kapustina, 34, had been driving to see friends in the village of Bereznyaki near her home in the city of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk in eastern Russia's Sakhalin Oblast.

She hit a patch of black ice that sent her Toyota Ipsum spinning 180 degrees as she cried out in horror before coming to a rest.

With her in-car camera still running, she climbs out to see if there is any damage to the side of her motor and is sent flying through the air moments later after being hit by a passing Toyota Novah.

Horrified motorist Hleb Ermakov, 55, who stopped to help, said: 'I saw the car parked by the side of the road and facing the wrong direction as a woman was standing beside it.

'Then the car in front of me just slammed straight into her. It was absolutely horrifying.  

'She was completely motionless and I thought she must be dead.

'But when I pulled over and got out I noticed her move a little and immediately called an ambulance.'

A hospital spokesman said: 'It's a miracle she wasn't killed. 

'Fortunately, she only had slight head injuries and was otherwise OK.'
