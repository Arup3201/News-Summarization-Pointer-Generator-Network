Film director George Lucas has unveiled plans for his $300m (£187m) art museum... and it wouldn't look out of place on the set of Star Wars.

The space-age Lucas Museum of Narrative Art was designed by noted Beijing architect Ma Yansong, who was inspired by the works of Frank Lloyd Wright and Mies van der Rohe.

Expected to open in 2018, it features a floating disc above four levels of exhibition space in 'infinite loops' and an observation deck with 360-degree views of the city and Lake Michigan.

The Lucas Museum of Narrative Art will house pieces from the Star Wars creator's $600m personal collection, including works by Norman Rockwell and Alberto Vargas and props from his ground-breaking movies.

The museum will be 'a gathering place to experience narrative art and the evolution of moving images - from illustration to cinema to the digital mediums of the future,' it wrote in a statement on its website.

As well as the permanent collection, the museum will host temporary exhibitions as well as educational events.

'It looks like a nuclear reactor': Reactions to the design have so far been mixed

Yansong's MAD Architects collaborated with Studio Gang from Chicago, who contributed the design for a bridge connection the property to Northerly Island and as well as the landscaping.

The building 'explores the relationship between nature and the urban environment,'  MAD Architects said in a statement, adding that it 'is both futuristic and timeless'.

'The Museum is not an isolated object, but a spatial experience that is defined by the people who occupy and interact with it. Its uninterrupted stone surfaces are as primitive as it is futuristic, evoking the great achievements of architectural history. 

The museum will show works from Lucas' collection. It's designed by MAD Architects, the firm behind Toronto's Absolute Towers (R)

'It is a place to discover and explore, to communicate and contemplate. More than a building, it is an urban vista for social interaction, bringing people closer to each other and to nature.'

Chicago residents have had mixed reactions to the plans. In opinions compiled by the Chicago Tribune, readers compared the structure to Jabba the Hut's desert spaceship, a nuclear power plant, a child's volcano science project, and Space Mountain.

The city's mayor Rahm Emanuel is standing by the plans, saying in a statement: 'George Lucas has revolutionised the art of storytelling over the last four decades and we are honored to be the recipient of this incredible legacy investment that will allow everyone to learn about and experience narrative arts.'
