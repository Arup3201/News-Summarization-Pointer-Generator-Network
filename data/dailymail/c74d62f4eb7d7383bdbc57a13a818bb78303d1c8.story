These painstakingly restored images offer up a snapshot of thriving commercial London more than 100 years ago.

The images are the product of a single day's walk through Spitalfields in East London on a Saturday morning in 1912. Children, away from school, can be seen thronging the streets enjoying themselves. However, some simply stand and stare at the strange spectacle of photographer C A Mathew burdened with a tripod and heavy camera.

On the day, April 20, London was still reeling from the news that HMS Titanic had sunk in the Atlantic after striking an iceberg five days earlier. The day's newspapers carried the latest details, as well as pictures of a packed memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral the previous day.

Mr Mathew's unposed photos, a contrast to the rigid portrait photography of the age, show the bustle of the streets as tradesmen rumble past in horse-drawn carriages. A collection of the images taken that day, which have been described as 'the most vivid evocation we have of Spitalfields' in 1912, are due to be exhibited later this month at a gallery not far from the streets pictured.

Some of the views have changed beyond recognition, but much of the architecture remains recognisible to this day.

Eleven Spitalfields will host the pictures, which belong to the Bishopsgate Institutute and were restored by local photographer Jeremy Freedman. The runs from March 7 to April 25.

Bustle of the streets: C A Mathew captured this scene, showing horse-drawn traffic along a busy East London street. Children look on with a mixture of excitement an apprehension as adults can be seen hovering around a pub in the background

Snapshot: The pictures, taken on a Saturday morning, show children thronging the streets as tradesmen tried to make their way between the brick buildings

Commercial: Pedestrians can be seen packing the streets outside traditional shops in this business district of London

Broad streets: Men, almost all wearing hats, can be seen walking from shop to shop as the day's shopping begins

Stand and stare: Shoppers and tradesmen seem intrguied by Mr Mathew's camera equipment, and stand back to stare directly into the shot

Then and now: The prospect down Artillery Passage looks very different today, but the distinctive shapes of the buildings are still recognisable

Passage of time: Some buildings on Bell Lane, in the background of the pictures above, are clearly the same as were pictured by Mr Mathew

Different: White Lion Street, which is now called Folgate Street, has the same shape as in 1912, but does not resemble the old photographs very much

One story dominated the morning papers on Saturday April 20 1912. Reports were still rolling in about the shocking sinking on the Titanic, which had struck an iceberg in the mid-Atlantic in the early hours of April 15.

The Daily Mail that day offered up a comprehensive account of the final hours, telling the now-famous story of how the band kept playing even as the ship, thought to be unsinkable, slipped beneath the waves.

History: The main story from the news pages of that day's Daily Mail

A striking picture of British mourners crowding the streets headed the page. It showed thousands of people gathered in front of St Paul's Cathedral, where a memorial service had been held the previous day for the 1,500 dead.

An accusatory side item from New York told of the moment Mr Ismay, the chairman of White Star Line which had sold the tickets to passengers, came ashore. The businessman explained how he managed to secure a space on the last lifeboat leaving the ship.

Meanwhile the main article praised the courage of Captain Edward Smith, whom it said remained absolutely calm throughout the disaster and filled passengers and crew with courage by urging them 'Be British!'
