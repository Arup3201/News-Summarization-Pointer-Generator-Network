Nationwide support for Nigel Farage’s Ukip has soared to an all-time high 25 per cent – enough for the party to take Parliament by storm with well over 100 MPs and a possible Labour Election victory.

That is the shock result of a Survation poll for The Mail on Sunday, carried out after Ukip rocked the Tories and Labour in two by-elections last week.

If the poll result was repeated in next year’s General Election, it would see the Tories lose 100 seats, the certain resignation of David Cameron – and the possibility of Ed Miliband in No10.

Nigel Farage could see himself in government after the next election according to a Mail on Sunday poll 

The Tories, under David Cameron could lose up to 100 seats as voters turn towards Ukip in mass numbers 

The collapse could see Ed Miliband handed the keys to Number 10 unless Cameron does a deal with Farage

To stop him, the Conservatives would have to join forces with Ukip and other parties from Scotland and Northern Ireland.

The sensational Survation poll shows the Tories and Labour level pegging on 31 per cent, six ahead of Ukip, with the Lib Dems on a paltry eight.

Pollsters were quick to point out last night that the surge in support for Ukip, buoyed by its success in last week’s Clacton by-election, could fall away in the run-up to the General Election, as has happened in the past with other so-called minor parties, such as the SDP.

But it is the strongest evidence yet that Ukip is on the brink of a major breakthrough which could change the political landscape forever. It means Farage could be closer than ever to his dream of holding a ministerial post.

Ukip have risen dramatically in the polls since April 2012 when they languished on 9% with little hope of an MP

David Cameron and Nigel Farage are the most popular duo to run the country according to the poll

According to the poll, one in four voters now support his self-styled ‘People’s Army’.

According to John Curtice, professor of politics at Strathclyde University, the poll would give Labour 253 MPs, Conservatives 187, Ukip 128, Lib Dems 11, and others, including Scots Nats and Ulster MPs, 71.

Prof Curtice said: ‘If Ukip are to turn votes into Commons seats in Britain’s first-past-the-post system, they need to build up bastions of local strength. Today’s poll suggests they may have begun to do that.

‘The 25 per cent level represents a 22-point increase on the three per cent the party won in 2010. If that increase were to occur evenly in every constituency, they could still fail to pick up a single seat.

‘But today’s poll suggests Ukip’s support has increased much more in the South of England outside London than it has elsewhere in the UK – by a staggering 34 points.

‘If that level was recorded throughout the South, Ukip could win as many as 128 seats, with no less than 102 of them coming from the Conservatives, whose vote in the region is down 14 points. In that event, Cameron would be left with just 187 seats, almost as weak a position as the Conservatives were in after their calamitous defeat in 1997.

Almost 60 per cent of people agree with Farage that HIV positive immigrants should not be allowed into the UK

David Cameron is the most trusted leader in all things apart from fixing a shelf, where Nigel Farage excels 

‘Mr Farage would achieve his ambition of holding the balance of power at Westminster. Any poll estimate of what is going on in an individual region is inevitably not as robust as that for the country as a whole. However, if Ukip are advancing more strongly in some parts of the South, its chances of establishing itself as a significant force at Westminster may well be higher than has so far been appreciated.’

The survey dramatically bears out Cameron’s warnings that a vote for Farage will give the No 10 keys to Miliband. But it also demonstrates his problems in neutralising the Ukip threat. Tory voters are opposed to any kind of Election pact with Farage, whereby Ukip candidates would stand aside for Conservatives – and vice versa – in key seats.

Paradoxically, while the survey shows the rise in Ukip could make Miliband Prime Minister, other aspects suggest Miliband is in danger of becoming a joke figure.

When respondents are asked if they can imagine him as Prime Minister, he comes behind Theresa May – and Farage. He is seen as Labour’s second worst leader in a third of a century, behind Neil Kinnock and only slightly ahead of Michael Foot. By contrast, Cameron is seen as the second best Tory leader since Thatcher.

The survey underlines the growing status of Farage and his party. His controversial call for immigrants who are HIV positive to be banned from entering Britain is supported by an overwhelming 58 per cent to 22. And voters appear to be warming to the idea of him having a government role after the next Election. When respondents were asked which combination of the four main party leaders they would like to run Britain, a Cameron-Farage ‘coalition’ comes top, followed by Cameron-Clegg, Miliband-Clegg and Miliband-Farage.

Farage is also the leader people would ask to fix a shelf, but least trusted to babysit, feed a pet or bake a cake. And, although a minority, one in three, believe Farage is fit to be a Cabinet Minister, his fans are in no doubt as to which job he should get. Immigration Minister is the clear favourite, followed by Deputy Prime Minister and Europe Minister.

Survation interviewed 1,003 people online on Friday. 

Voters consider Ed Miliband the fifth-best Labour leader ever, while Cameron is only second to Mrs Thatcher
