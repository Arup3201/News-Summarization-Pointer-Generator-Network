Egyptian police have been accused of raping both female and male anti-government activists  with claims one man was thrown half naked into a cell as a guard shouted 'here is your lollipop'.

The country has faced almost four years of unrest since a popular uprising against former president and autocrat Hosni Mubarak in 2011.

There appears to be increasing pressure on the authorities to release thousands of protesters, who were locked up during the riots.

Anti-government protesters demonstrating at a university campus in Cairo, last month. There has been allegations that police have used rape as a weapon against both male and female protesters 

Now it has emerged that some activists have claimed that they were sexually assaulted by police after joining in with the protests.

One woman told the Daily Telegraph how she had been raped when she was arrested at a protest in support of former Muslim Brotherhood president Mohamed Morsi.

She told the newspaper: 'The policeman shouted "You want to act like a man? Let me show you what it is to be a woman" - and then dragged me to the truck. 

The woman also recalls how she was watched as the assault took place and received no medical attention during her time in custody, which has now led her to become isolated from her husband and friends.

She added: 'I lost everything. Now I am afraid of almost all men, sometimes even my two-year-old son.'

Earlier this month, a lawyer representing a defendant in the trial of 26 men accused of debauchery at a public bath-house told the court his client was thrown half-naked into a cell, with officers telling fellow prisoners 'here is your lollipop'.

Meanwhile Amnesty International say they too have received accounts of sexual assault and abuse by both men and women and say they reflect a much wider trend.

Earlier this week President Sisi had said that Egyptians had the right to protest but cautioned that demonstrating could cause more harm to the country's battered economy

However, Egypt's interior ministry has refused to comment on the allegations.

It comes just a day after around 50 people staged an anti-government protest in downtown Cairo against what they called the 'military rule' of new president Abdel Fattah al-Sisi.

Security forces used tear gas and birdshots to quickly disperse the crowds, according to security sources and added that 13 people were arrested.

Earlier this week President Sisi had said that Egyptians had the right to protest but cautioned that demonstrating could cause more harm to the country's battered economy.

But human rights activists say a law restricting protests and other security legislation enacted by President Sisi in the absence of a parliament have rolled back freedoms won in the 2011 uprising.

Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi, who has cautioned that demonstrations in the country could cause more harm to its battered economy 

He was elected virtually unopposed last May, almost a year after the military he then led toppled freely elected president Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood.

The Brotherhood, which has been weakened by one of the toughest crackdowns against the movement, has called on Egyptians to stage mass protests to mark the 18-day uprising.

A security crackdown under President Sisi's watch ended months of economically ruinous anti-government unrest and jailed thousands of Islamists and liberal activists alike, including people for demonstrating without a police permit.

Egypt will hold a long-awaited parliamentary election in two phases starting in March. 

President Sisi hopes the vote will deliver stability after years of upheaval. Critics call the vote a sham given what they say is a clampdown on political freedoms
