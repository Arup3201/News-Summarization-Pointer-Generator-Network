River staff in Cambridge are being armed with stab vests amid fears the city's historic punting trade could turn violent.

The placid-looking tourist activity, which can earn punt operators hundreds of pounds per hour, has been blighted by an increase in illegal operators and dirty tricks.

Unscrupulous punt owners have threatened rivals with knives, smashed holes in rival boats and filled vacant punts with concrete in an attempt to one-up the competition.

What lies beneath: Punting on the river Cam may look placid, but tensions around illegal operators are now running so high that river bailiffs are being armed with stab vests

The tense atmosphere surrounding the placid-looking activity has led the Cam Conservators, who maintain the River Cam, to buy in the stab vests to protect their staff as they police the banks.

The city council has spent thousands on punt police to patrol the River Cam and clamp down on aggressive touts.

Dirty tricks: Punt operators have turned to making violent threats and sinking each other's boats amid fierce competition for tourists' money

But the situation has got steadily worse each year with punts being vandalised to put competition out of business, knife threats, mooring chains being attacked by bolt cutters and even claims of sinking.

One woman was left with a broken hip after being knocked as she walked past a brawl between long-standing rivals vying for trade on the quayside.

In another incident an angry tout grabbed another by the throat during a stand-off, while another was threatened with a knife after a dispute over a local restaurant got out of hand.

On another occasion a punt operator used a chainsaw to sink a rival punt and another time two punts were sunk with gravel and concrete.

River bailiffs also have to check boat registrations, tackle illegal moorings and monitor bylaws.

Jonathan Wakefield, deputy river manager for Cam Conservators, said: 'There have been reported incidents of assaults on the river and the Conservators took the view they needed to give their staff the option of wearing stab vests.

'If a member of staff feels they would benefit from a stab vest they will be available to them.'

Kevin Price, a city councillor, said: 'It's a sign of a sad time when we have got to think about providing such equipment for a guy who is just doing a job.

'It's not welcome, we don't want river bailiffs to have to wear stab vests but there are some unpleasant and aggressive people out there, just because it's leafy Cambridge it's like any other place and there is good and bad stuff going on.

There are around 260 punts on the river and a single 12-seat craft can earn £150 an hour.

Since mid-2007, 151 crimes with links to punting have been reported, including vandalism and violence. There have been 31 reported clashes between rival touts, including knife threats.
