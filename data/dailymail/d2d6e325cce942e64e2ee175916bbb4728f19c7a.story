Stewards were forced to close the world's best-known racetrack - after vandals painted this 30ft penis on the tarmac.

Hundreds of Brits head to the Nurburgring in Germany each week to test their skills on the 12.9 mile racetrack.

But those who made the 800-mile plus round trip to the track on Sunday were left waiting after a juvenile yet admittedly hilarious group painted the epic phallus on the course.

Admit you laughed: Unidentified vandals painted an enormous penis onto the iconic Nurburgring racetrack in Germany

Fearing the humungous appendage could distract drivers, a specialist team was called into paint over it

Officials feared the 'artwork' could put the high-speed motorists off their game so a specialist team spent 90 minutes treating the graffiti before re-opening the track to the public.

Sam Preston, from Bristol, made the trip to the course on Sunday when the incident happened.

He said: 'Me and a friend drove down from the UK to the 'Ring for a weekend of driving.

'The weather was perfect, meaning a lot of cars were queuing for a 10am opening time.

Drivers waiting to use the track thought the graffiti was amusing. The officials did not see it the same way

Sam Preston from Bristol said: 'About halfway around the track we found a group of track marshals and police gathered around this huge white graffiti penis'

'At around 11am the barriers were still not opening, so we decided to see if we could find the cause of the continued closure.

'About halfway around the track we found a group of track marshals and police gathered around this huge white graffiti penis.

'The officials didn't seem to find it as humourous as the bystanders - and swiftly called for a paint removal machine to be brought to the scene.'

Motorists pay £17 to drive a lap of the track, which was recently put up for sale for around £81million.
