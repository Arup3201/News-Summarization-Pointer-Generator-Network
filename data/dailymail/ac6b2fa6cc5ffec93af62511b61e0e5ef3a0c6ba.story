Former Arsenal captain Thierry Henry has joined the club's backroom staff in a role apparently focused on youth development.  

Josh Benson, a player for the Gunners' under 15s side, took to Twitter to reveal that he and his team-mates had been coached by Henry on Thursday afternoon. 

The Frenchman is Arsenal's all time leading goalscorer, having netted 228 times in 376 appearances across two spells for the north London outfit.

Henry is best known for his first spell between 1999 and 2007, during which he won two Premier League titles. The second of those came as part of Arsene Wenger's 'Invincibles' who managed to go the entire 2003-2004 campaign unbeaten. 

Following time with Spanish giants Barcelona and in the twilight of his career, MLS side New York Red Bulls, he returned to Arsenal briefly in 2012 on loan during the American close season.  

Since announcing his retirement from playing last year, Henry has been working as a television pundit with Sky Sports, but this recent foray into coaching is being mooted as the prelude to a venture into management in the long-run. 

Indeed, given his entrenched association with Arsenal football club, it is unsurprising that Henry has been earmarked as one of Wenger's potential successors when he finally moves on.
