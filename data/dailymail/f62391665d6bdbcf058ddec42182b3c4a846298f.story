Aleysha McLoughlin was an aspiring lawyer and tipped to get A grades at her GCSEs, but she struggled with a history of self harm and was found hanged - with scars on her arms and thighs that read 'hate' and 'fat' 

A promising teenager tipped to achieve straight A grades in her GCSEs was found dead with the words 'fat' and 'hate' etched into her arm. 

Aspiring lawyer Aleysha McLoughlin, 16, had been living with her foster mother Beverley Sharples in Bolton and was found hanged. 

Just 24 hours before the teenager, who had a history of self harming, had been taken to A&E at Royal Bolton Hospital in Greater Manchester where a medic told her she was 'having a bad day.' 

After her death scars were found on Aleysha's arms and thighs, which may have been many years old, and spelled out the words 'hate', 'fat' and 'ruin', Bolton Coroners' Court heard.  

An inquest into the GCSE student's death heard she had been taken from her parents due to their drug addiction and initially lived with her great-aunt.

She flourished at school where she was tipped for straight A grades at GCSE and competed for head girl status. 

But when she was 14 her sister Karly got in touch through Facebook and said she wanted to meet. The pair did so and as they grew closer and began having contact with their biological mother Gaynor Rothwell.

At one stage she disappeared for three and the teenager's behaviour deteriorated. 

She was later moved into foster care in November 2012.

From March 2013 Aleysha began running away from home for days at a time and would often be found with her 19-year-old sister. The two even staged a 'rooftop protest' on a care centre at one point in a bid to be housed closer together.

The inquest heard that there had been numerous attempts by social workers to help the teenager, and her foster mother Beverley Sharples had taken her to hospital after she took an overdose. 

But Aleysha refused help.

Mrs Sharples added that on February 8 last year after enjoying a 'normal family night in' with a takeaway, Aleysha had gone to meet her sister.

But shortly after the pair leaving she received a phone call from the police saying the pair had been caught trying to jump off a nearby bridge but were stopped before they had the chance.

On April 2 last year Mrs Sharples received a call from St Catherine's Academy in Bolton saying the teenager had been self harming, and she took her to Royal Bolton Hospital in Greater Manchester.

Mrs Sharples told the inquest: 'I phoned the paramedics and they suggested we go. She wasn't happy about going. She was assessed in A&E then sent to another bit of the hospital and the nurse also asked if she wanted to speak to someone while she was there.

The teenager had been taken into care after she began getting into trouble with her sister 

'Surprisingly she said yes which is a massive step because she had refused up until then. A man from the RAID team took her to a room and she was in there for one hour and ten minutes and I wasn't allowed in.

'He said she wouldn't engage. She said it was a waste of time and he said 'I was having a bad day'.

'Before she went to sleep she was really upset. I asked what she was crying for and she said 'I'm sorry, you have been in the hospital with me for five-and-a-half hours, I'm a pain in the bum.' I said yes but you're my pain in the bum.'

The medic was thought to have been unaware of Aleysha's scars at this stage. 

The next morning, Aleysha came downstairs at 10am, but did not want any breakfast. Mrs Sharples asked if she wanted to go with her to Horwich but instead Aleysha went back to bed. 

Aleysha's foster mother had taken her to Royal Bolton Hospital after she self harmed and a medic told the teenager that she was 'having a bad day.' The next day Aleysha, 16, was found hanged in her bedroom 

Aleysha  lived with her great aunt for years after being taken from her parents because of their drug addiction

The foster mother said Aleysha had fitted in well at their home and the two had been getting close.

Mrs Sharples left the house and returned at around 2pm after running some errands. When she went upstairs to check on Aleysha some time later she found her body.

Pathologist Dr Charles Wilson told the inquest that there were scars on the teenager's arms and thighs, and some spelled out words. 

He said: 'On her left thigh were the words ruin and fat. The cuts would have taken at least a couple of months to reach the stage I saw. They could have been years old. 

'A wound to her upper arm spelled the word hate.'

Ms Sharples said foster children were always told to cover their bodies when in their foster homes in accordance with safeguarding rules, and so she didn’t notice any signs of self-harming. 

Flowers and tributes were left to Aleysha after she was found hanged in her bedroom on April 3 

Bolton Coroners' Court heard that the teenager had repeatedly refused to engage with social workers 

The teenager's great aunt Carol Kerfoot had cared for her from July 2003 until she was 14. She told the hearing she first saw some surface scratches on Aleysha's arms in November 2012 after she returned to the house from a short stint in foster care.

'They were surface scratches but when I talked about it she ran off upstairs and didn't want to discuss it,' she said. 'It was the only time I noticed self-harm.

'I found her to be a good child. She had some issues and sadly they led to the breakdown of our placement but she was a good child. She had a lot of friends and was beautiful inside and out.

'She always maintained she didn't want anything to do with her real parents but then she did. Her sister got in touch over Facebook and it snowballed from there.'

The inquest, expected to last four days, continues.
