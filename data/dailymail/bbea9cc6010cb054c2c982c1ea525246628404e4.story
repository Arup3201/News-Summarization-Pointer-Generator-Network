They look the part, but these pieces of armour may not stand up to a Game Of Thrones-style sword attack.

Each has been carefully crafted out of Vaseline.

The gooey protective garments are the work of South Korean artist Jung-ki Beak who got the idea after having to use the stuff to protect his chapped skin.

They look the part: Two models wear the Vaseline armour made by Korean artist Jung-ki Beak

But would they stop a sword? The model on the left wears a helmet apparently designed after the style of ancient Greek armour, while the one on the left is wearing a ninja-style full face helmet

But is it art? Mr Beak, 31, who studied in London and 
Glasgow, has fashioned a range of helmets and chest armour by moulding 
the petroleum jelly-based product into shape

Two more models wear the unique helmets: In the artworks, Mr Beak applies the Vaseline to the weak parts of the body such as the head, hand or chest

'A very important meaning in my individual 
living habits': How the jelly is applied. Mr Beak says he uses Vaseline each winter to protect the
skin on his hand, which was weakened by a bad burn he suffered as a 
child

The 31-year-old, who studied in London and Glasgow, has fashioned a range of helmets and chest armour by moulding the petroleum jelly-based product into shape.

'I am interested in the function of Vaseline because it has a very important meaning in my individual living habits,' the artist said.

'Every winter I need to apply Vaseline on my left-hand to prevent dryness, otherwise the skin becomes cracked because it is very thin and weak due to a burn that I got in my childhood.

'I make the armour as an art work as it is a symbol of protection, with Vaseline for the weak parts of the body such as head, hand and chest.

'I thought that armour was suitable for representing the meaning of Vaseline as a function of protection.'
