Luis Suarez has moved to the Pyrenees to begin his pre-season training regime with his personal trainer in tow.

The Barcelona striker, prevented from working with his team-mates because of his four-month ban from 'all football activity', wants to be fit for the new season as soon as possible.

He is hoping that when the Court of Arbitration for Sport hear his appeal, in the second week of August, they reduce his ban and he can join Luis Enrique's men fit for the new season.

Suarez has chosen the Pyrenees to 
train because the weather is less hot and humid than Barcelona, which 
will allow him to work harder.

It is the same place that Eric Abidal chose to go to in October 2012, when he went with a physiotherapist.

Training at altitude will also benefit Suarez's fitness when he returns to Barcelona.

Furthermore,
 he has been advised by his lawyers to stay out of the spotlight and so 
training away from media and supporters in the Pyrenees will allow him 
to do just that.

His legal team are anxious to ensure that FIFA do not think he is contravening their sanctions.

Suarez hired the personal trainer himself, without any assistance from Barcelona, as per FIFA rules.

He is not allowed a coach linked either to his club or his national team.

Even
 if Suarez's ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini during the World Cup is 
not reduced, both he and the club hope that it will at least be relaxed 
enough for the Uruguayan to join in with Barcelona training.

His team-mates are currently training at St George's Park in England ahead of their pre-season campaign which starts against Nice on Saturday week.
