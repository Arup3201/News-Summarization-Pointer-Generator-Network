'Freak accident': MP Graham Stuart is in hospital after slipping on ice while skiing in Chamonix

It's a rather painful case of adding insult to injury.

Tory MP Graham Stuart broke his pelvis, punctured his right lung and fractured several ribs – after slipping on ice just feet from a restaurant on the last day of his skiing holiday.

The 51-year-old was on a four-day trip with a group of friends in Chamonix, the French Alps, and had spent the morning off-piste.

He described the accident as ‘painfully ironic and very unheroic’.

The MP for Beverley and Holderness has been working from his hospital bed, his office manager said.

The education select committee chairman is due to have an operation on his pelvis tomorrow.

His officer manager Nicki Roberts said: 'He’s in good spirits and working from his hospital bed. He has been carrying out constituency work.

'He’s on his email and keeping up to date with his Twitter and Facebook pages. He has had various friends to visit.

'It was a freak accident. He was doing the last ski of the last day of the two-day trip. He was skiing to a restaurant and was on soft snow.

'But it turned into ice and he slipped badly. His skis catapulted over his head and he landed badly.'

She added: 'Everyone’s just thankful that the doctors have said he will be OK.'

After the accident, on March 17, Mr Stuart had to be evacuated from the mountain on a snowmobile.

Medics said they expected the father-of-two to be in hospital for at least three weeks.

Mr Stuart has thanked well-wishers on his Facebook page. He wrote: 'Thank you for all your warm wishes.

'I appreciate them all and hope you’ll be pleased to know that I’m in good spirits.'

Mr Stuart was first elected in 2005 and in 2011 he came under fire after contractors working for his local council tarmacked the private road to his luxury home for free.

Workers employed by East Riding Council resurfaced 164 feet of a lane not run by the council in Beverley, East Yorkshire, at his wife Anne's request, despite nearby public roads and potholes in need of repair.
