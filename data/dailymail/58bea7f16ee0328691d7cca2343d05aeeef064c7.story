Over a hundred police officers were called to help move drills from a potential fracking site this afternoon - but only a few activists showed up to protest.

Officers have been drafted in to assist energy company Cuadrilla remove their exploratory drilling equipment from the site in Balcombe, West Sussex.

The operation is expected to cost the taxpayer around £3million.

Protest: Only a few activists, pictured, arrived to protest at the removal of the equipment today

Action: Three activists speak with police officers who have been drafted in to assist the removal of the drills

Removed: A protestor is arrested by police, pictured, bringing the total number of arrests up to 124

But rather than a sea of activists - officers today were faced with less than 20 protestors.

Just two of those were arrested.

Rows of officers from four local forces were stationed outside the entrance to the site - which still has around 50 activists camping outside it - this morning.

They then stood guard as the equipment was moved away on the back of HGV lorries.

As the drills were driven from from the now infamous site on the outskirts of the village, officers walked beside the lorries while they travelled down the small country lanes.

Guard: Police protect the Cuadrilla fracking equipment as it leaves the site

Protection: Officers then move to surround the equipment as it is taken away on a lorry

At one point, police from Surrey, Thames Valley, Hampshire and the Metropolitan Police, escorted some activists away from the lorries.

Some protestors have said they feel they are outnumbered by the large police presence - especially as Cuadrilla have hired security guards with dogs from G4S.

The operation is expected to last until Saturday.

However it could continue next year as Cuadrilla are applying for planning permission to further assess the levels of underground oil.

The site has been in the news since July when Cuadrilla were hired to carry out a period of exploratory drilling.

Campaigners flocked to the Balcombe site and camped outside for several weeks to highlight their objection to the controversial method - which involves using high-pressure liquid pumped deep underground to split shale rock and release gas.

Presence: Around 100 officers from four forces attended the site

Outnumbered: The massive police presence dwarfed the number of activists

At one point around a hundred police – including trained riot officers –  were brought in to break up one blockade.

A total of 124 people have been arrested at the site since the protests began, including Green MP Caroline Lucas.

She was charged with public disorder offences after she took part in a sit-in at the site's entrance last month.

However, earlier this month Cuadrilla admitted Balcombe was unlikely to become a fracking site.

The company  said there are likely to be other more suitable sites instead.

It said: The site is unlikely to go into full production. We are not ruling it out completely. The fact is that we have a large licence area and there are likely to be more suitable sites elsewhere.’

At the time Prime Minister David Cameron insisted that every part of the country must be prepared to accept fracking sites to extract shale gas from deep underground.

Equipment is being removed from the site as initial exploratory drilling has now come to a finish

Cuadrilla have said the Balcombe site is unlikely to be used as the drilling was less fruitful than expected
