Owner Pam Dillion, 55, claims that her cat Tuppence is the world's oldest moggy

A Briton claims she owns the world's oldest cat - a 27-year-old one-eyed moggy who has been run over an incredible 25 times.

Pam Dillon, 55, says her pet Tuppence was born in 1987 and beats the current official World Record Holder Tiffany Two, who lives in the USA, by one year.

Tuppence has used all of her nine lives and then some, and experts say in human terms she would be around 125-years-old.  

She only has half a tail after one of her many road accidents that saw her lose 25 lives - including one last year when she broke her back legs. 

Tuppence also lost a further life and an eye after a coming together with a dog two years ago.

In total it is estimated that the moggy has used up 26 lives. 

But Ms Dillon, of Plymouth, Devon, said despite her cat's battered body, she is still going strong.

 'There is no secret remedy for a long life,' she said.

'We had another cat in the family who lived to 22.

'I give her oil and garlic tablets but really Tuppence is just lucky to be alive.'

Infact Tuppence has used up 26 lives after she has been run over 25 times and then attacked 

The oldest cat living is Tiffany Two - born 13 March 1988 - aged 26 years 204 days as of 3 October 2014.

Tiffany Two lives with her owner, Sharron Voorhees in San Diego, California, USA. 

Ms Dillon, who lives on her own, only took ownership of Tuppence when her father Raymond died aged 82 in February last year.

He was given her as a young kitten after her brother Clive, found her while working at the Devonport dockyard in 1987.

One-eyed Tuppence has used up all of her nine lives and has survived being run over an incredible 25 times

'Tuppence was just a kitten,' she said.

'She was a dockyard moggy and when she turned up she was shabby and mucky as she had been out in the rain.

'None of us expected he would still be here 27 years later. I am amazed to discover she might be the oldest in the world. It is lovely.

Tuppence also only has half a tail after one of her many road accidents - including one last year when she broke her back legs

'She is just brilliant - she sleeps a lot now and can't run, so I keep her away from the road. She has been run over 25 times - and I don't think she would survive another accident.'

Tuppence celebrated her 27th birthday on December 21 last year with a small party and a few extra treats.

Ms Dillon said: 'She has been through the wars. She has half a tail and one eye and is looking a bit rough.

Her owner is confident that Tuppence will make her 28th Birthday in December this year

'We nearly lost her recently in the vets but she suddenly started perking up again.

She is still lively - and we think she will make it to her 28th birthday.

'It is brilliant she is still here. She just sits around, eats and occasionally goes out to the garden. She walks with a wobble and is not as agile as she once was.

Tuppence is very protective of Pam's other cat, Tigger, who is 22-years of age

'Even though I only got her when my father died, she has always been part of the family and I love her.

'I also have two German Shepherds who she loves and is very protective of and another cat Tigger, who is 22.'

In June this year Poppy the tortoiseshell, who was born in February 1990, the same month as Nelson Mandela was released from prison, from Bournemouth, Dorset, died at the age of 24.

She lived through five British Prime Ministers and was officially recognised by Guinness World Records on May 19 2014.

The oldest cat in history was a feline called Creme Puff who was born on 3 August 1967 and lived until 6 August 2005 - an amazing 38 years and 3 days.

Creme Puff lived with her owner, Jake Perry, in Austin, Texas, USA.

Other cats who have made a claim to the record over the past few years, include Mischief from St Austell, Cornwall, who celebrated his 27th birthday, Lucy from Llanelli, South Wales, whose owner's said she was 39-years-old, and Olive from Partington, Greater Manchester, who was 24-years-old.
