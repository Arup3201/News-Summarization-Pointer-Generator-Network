A Home Office minister last night demanded a ban on controversial US 'pick-up artist' Julien Blanc entering Britain.

Liberal Democrat Lynne Featherstone took the rare step of speaking out publicly to say she was lobbying Home Secretary Theresa May to refuse the self-styled dating coach a visa.

Mr Blanc has been heavily criticised over £2,000-a-head seminars in which he is said to teach men sexually abusive and racist methods to attract women.

He disturbingly encourages men to treat women with disrespect and contempt, including video footage of him apparently grabbing women by the throat.

Other recommended pick-up methods include threatening to commit suicide, injuring pets and isolating women from friends.

Crime minister Ms Featherstone spoke out as pressure mounted on the authorities to block an upcoming seminar by Mr Blanc in London, scheduled to begin in February.

She said: 'I am extremely concerned by the sexist and utterly abhorrent statements Julien Blanc has made about women. If he was allowed to perform in the UK I have no doubt that cases of sexual harassment and intimidation would increase.

'Free speech is obviously hugely important, but with free speech comes responsibility. It is not appropriate to talk about choking girls under any circumstances.'

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper said Mr Blanc should be barred from coming to the UK on the grounds that his promotion of violence against women is 'not conducive to the public good'.

She said: 'It is important that respect for the laws on sexual assault and violence are upheld and that we send a clear message from Britain about zero tolerance of violence against women and girls.'

Mr Blanc has made a name for himself by being what he describes as an 'executive coach' at a company called Real Social Dynamics, which he calls an 'international leader in dating advice'.

It promises customers the chance to 'witness dating coaches attract beautiful women in live demonstrations'.

Video footage has emerged of him apparently grabbing women by the throat and threatening to commit suicide as a pick-up line 

But videos and pictures of Blanc in action suggest he encourages men to harass women with the aim of having sex with them.

A video of one of his seminar in Japan shows him urging men in the audience not to bother being 'polite' to Japanese women - but instead 'grab girls and shove their head' into their 'crotch.'

More than 110,000 people have signed an online petition calling for Mr Blanc to be refused entry to the UK after he was forced to cut short a visit to Australia following widespread protests.

Sarah Green, from the End Violence Against Women Coalition, said: 'His so-called pick up coaching promotes behaviour amounting to sexual harassment and sexual assault.

'More broadly, he is part of a culture which trivialises abuse of women and racism. At worst this tells victims of abuse that what has happened to them doesn't matter, and gives potential abusers the nod that such behaviour will not be taken seriously.'

A Home Office spokesman said: 'All visa applications are considered on their individual merits in line with the immigration rules.

'The Home Secretary has the power to exclude an individual if she considers that his or her presence in the UK is not conducive to the public good.'
