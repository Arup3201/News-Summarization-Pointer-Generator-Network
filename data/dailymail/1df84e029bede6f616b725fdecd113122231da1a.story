Retired baseball star Curt Schilling has revealed that he is battling mouth cancer - and says it was caused by 30 years of chewing tobacco at ball games.

Schilling told the WEEI/NESN Jimmy Fund Radio Telethon today that has has undergone seven excruciating weeks of chemotherapy, lost his sense of taste and smell and dropped 75lbs following rigorous treatment at Brigham & Women's  Hospital in Boston.

The 47-year-old father of four says he has been fighting the disease since February and is currently in remission. 

Former Boston Red Sox great Curt Schilling was last seen in public in May after being diagnosed with cancer in February

He said he never felt sorry for himself after the cancer diagnosis and never wondered 'Why me?' - because he believes he brought the disease on himself.

'I do believe without a doubt, unquestionably that chewing is what gave me cancer and I'm not going to sit up here from the pedestal and preach about chewing. I will say this: I did for about 30 years,' he told the Boston radio station. 

'It was an addictive habit. I can think of so many times in my life when it was so relaxing to just sit back and have a dip and do whatever. 

'And I lost my sense of smell, my taste buds for the most part. I had gum issues, they bled, all this other stuff. None of it was enough to ever make me quit. 

'The pain that I was in going through this treatment, the second or third day it was the only thing in my life that had that I wish I could go back and never have dipped. Not once. It was so painful.'

The treatment was so horrible, he said, that after just three sessions, he could no longer undergo the process without first being given drugs to calm his nerves. 

Schilling, who chewed tobacco for 30 years, believes the habit caused the cancer that resulted in him losing his sense of taste and smell

Schilling's announcement comes in the wake of baseball Hall of Famer Tony Gwynn death from cancer at age 54 in June. Gwynn had also blamed his cancer on his habit of chewing tobacco.

Schilling was the hero of 2004 the Red Sox playoff run that ended in the team's first World Series victory in 86 years. He pitched a World Series game and a decisive playoff game against with an ankle injury that led to him bleeding through his sock on live TV. Schillings cool performance on the mount is now part of baseball lore and the World Series sock is in the Hall of Fame.

He retired in 2009 after 20 seasons in the majors that included four World Series appearances and three wins. He was voted co-MVP in 2001 when he helped lead the Arizona Diamondbacks to victory over the Yankees.

Schilling is currently being sued by Rhode Island's economic development agency after his video game company received a $75 million state loan guarantee and then collapsed. 

Schilling is being treated at Brigham and Women's Hospital and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. He received seven weeks of chemotherapy and radiation treatments and is in remission. He says he's lost 75 pounds.

Schilling is a three-time World Series champion with the Arizona Diamondbacks and Boston Red Sox.
