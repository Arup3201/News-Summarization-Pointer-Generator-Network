Thousands took to the streets of Melbourne today for a peace march in memory of Jill Meagher, the Irish journalist whose death has left the Australian city shell shocked.

Organisers say the march aimed to bring the local community together to protest against violence after the 29-year-old Irish national was raped and murdered following a night out with friends. 

Mrs Meagher, originally from 
Drogheda, Co Louth, was last seen leaving a bar in the early hours of the morning after a night out with colleagues.

Peace march: Thousands of people march along the streets of Melbourne in memory of Irish journalist Jill Meagher who was found buried in a shallow grave after disappearing following a night out

It is understood her body was discovered in a shallow grave at Gisborne South, about 30km from where she vanished.

Her mother Edith McKeon, who had travelled from Perth in Western Australia, joined the marchers in a minute’s silence in the city's Brunswick park.

She thanked the public for their support and now is appealing for more CCTV cameras to be installed in the 
suburb where her daughter went missing.

She said: 'I would like to thank the huge support 
here in Melbourne, it’s just been unbelievable. Just thank you, simply 
thank you.

'And I hope they put more cameras in here to keep people safe. And just thank you everybody, everybody for all your support.'

Police in Melbourne have charged 41-year-old Adrian Ernest Bayley with the rape and murder of Mrs Meagher.

Jill Meagher: The 29-year-old's body is understood to have been discovered in a shallow grave around 30km from where she vanished in Melbourne

Bayley,
from the Coburg suburb of the city, was arrested after the last image 
of Mrs Meagher on a shop’s CCTV footage showed her talking to a man 
wearing a blue hoodie before she vanished.

Mrs Meagher had been on a night out with colleagues from Australian Broadcasting 
Corporation radio, leaving them at around 1.30am local time.

But 
she failed to make the short walk to her home less than a mile from Bar 
Etiquette in Sydney Road, Brunswick, prompting her husband Thomas to 
raise the alarm.

Her uncle Michael McKeon 
described the 29-year-old as 'a brilliant person', and said her family -
including parents George and Edith McKeon - were 'powerless to 
describe' their loss.

'Jillian
was a brilliant person, so happy, great worker, so in love with Tom - 
all the cliches, that was her,' said Mr McKeon, who had last seen his 
niece three weeks ago when she was on a trip home to Ireland.

'Tom and Jillian were a lovely couple and they don't deserve this - nobody does.'

A statement issued by Mr McKeon on behalf of the journalist's family said: 'We are devastated. We are heartbroken.

'She was the first grandchild my mother had and her aunts, uncles and cousins are powerless to describe their loss.'

'There are no words to describe how we feel at what has happened.'

Shock: Organisers say the march aimed to bring the local community together to protest against violence

Appeal: Mrs Meagher mother Edith McKeon has thanked the public for their support and is appealed for more CCTV cameras to be installed in the suburb where her daughter went missing

'Both
the McKeon family and Meagher family will have to plan now to grieve 
for Jillian and this is going to be one of the hardest things given 
that, only three years ago, we came together for the marriage of this 
lovely couple.'

Mrs Meagher and her husband Tom moved to Australia from Ireland three years ago.

Mr
McKeon admitted the family had 'feared the worst' during the agonising 
six-day search.

Her handbag was later discovered in a lane off Sydney Road.

Bereft: Jill Meagher's husband Tom pictured leaving Melbourne Magistrates' Court

Tom Meagher had combed the streets around the couple's home 
as her family anxiously awaited a clue to her whereabouts.

The area where her body was 
eventually discovered is farming land -  also known as Couangalt - and 
is nestled in the Macedon Ranges Shire in Victoria.

Bayley, who reportedly claims to be a Buddhist, is due to reappear before magistrates in Melbourne in the 
morning.

Police said the 'Find Jillian Meagher' social media campaign sparked by her disappearance had helped their investigation.

More than 120,000 people signed up to a Help Us Find Jillian Meagher page on Facebook as police searched for the 29-year-old.

Officers studied CCTV footage taken from several shops along the Sydney Road route in Brunswick as part of their inquiries.

ABC colleague Gloria Kalache has said the city of Melbourne had been shaken by the random attack.

‘There
is a feeling of shock, it’s a case that not only affected all of us in 
ABC, but particularly it affected lots of women in the Melbourne area, 
who walk home by themselves without giving a second thought to it,' she 
said.
