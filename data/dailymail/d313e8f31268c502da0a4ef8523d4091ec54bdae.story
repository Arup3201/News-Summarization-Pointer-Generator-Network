For a man who four months ago had a machete embedded in his left thigh, Kell Brook has no plans to tread slowly now that he has reclaimed his future in boxing.

There was certainly an air of impatience around Sheffield’s world champion yesterday as he set about the challenge of making up for lost time, starting with his ring comeback on March 28 and moving on, you sense, to a future date with Amir Khan.

The particulars are that he will defend his IBF welterweight title for the first time at Sheffield Arena against Jo Jo Dan, the Canadian-based Romanian who is mandatory challenger for a belt Brook won only weeks before he was viciously assaulted in Tenerife.

The fascination of this fight will be learning how much Brook has been affected, in a physical sense, by that brutal episode last September.

Quite aside from the blood transfusion that helped save his life, Brook needed more than 60 stitches to piece two deeply cut muscles together again. Speaking to Sportsmail nine days after the assault, he admitted there was no feeling at all around the wound.

He went on to say that the surgeon had told him the sensations might never return, so it is against that backdrop that Brook’s comeback must be judged.

Will the wonderfully talented 28-year-old still have the speed and movement that contributed so much to his 33 wins from 33 fights?

That is what should be discovered from a reasonably tough assignment against a challenger who has won 34 fights and lost only two.

Only after his title defence will it be possible to judge if he could still mix with Khan, in the event that Brook’s management succeed in luring the Bolton man to a fight.

‘It was the lowest part of my career,’ said Brook yesterday, as he announced his first fight since he won the world title from Shawn Porter in California last August.

‘I went from winning the world title and being on cloud nine to being on the bottom of the ocean, lying on that hospital bed. I was wondering if I would walk again, never mind fight. I did not know.

‘But now I am great, very fit and healthy. My leg is bang on, fine and I’ve worked hard.

‘It will be emotional. I can’t wait to get in and defend my world title among the Sheffield fans and in Great Britain. I am undefeated and that is how I mean to go on.’

Of Dan, Brook added: ‘He is No 1 contender for the title and a very tough customer. He comes to fight southpaw, he’s awkward and I’ll have to work hard. I’ll have my work cut out.’

While the mere occurrence of this bout represents a victory for Brook, the bigger picture calls for a fight with Khan.

Sportsmail revealed in the aftermath of Brook’s world-title win that his promoter, Eddie Hearn, had eyes on a Wembley date. The two men have long disliked one another, with Khan of the opinion that he belongs in a higher category of fighter.

The truth of the matter is that Brook holds the belt and with it has a handsome bargaining chip, not least because Khan looks no closer to securing a fight with Floyd Mayweather.

Hearn told Sportsmail this week: ‘I offered Khan $5million to take the fight before Kell won a world title. With a world title involved, the pot of money for this fight is even bigger. If Khan truly thinks he could beat Kell, then he should step up.

‘I would back Kell every day of the week to win that fight. We are more than happy to have a 60-40 for the winner or 70-30 for the winner. In fact, how about winner takes all? It’s big balls time.’

For his part, Brook said yesterday: ‘I want the hardest fights, the massive fights for the summer, to fill an arena, a massive stadium.

‘We are looking at the biggest names. Names like Juan Manuel Marquez, and Marcos Maidana. Maybe the kid from Bolton (Khan), if he wants to do it. I am ready.

‘But don’t get me wrong, Jo Jo Dan is no walkover. He is a tough customer and he is coming to fight hard.’

That should not be a major problem compared to what Brook has already encountered.
