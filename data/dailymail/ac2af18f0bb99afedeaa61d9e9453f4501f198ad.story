A well-known female television personality has today told how she was left 'frustrated' by police officers probing a stalker who had sent her emails about murdered presenter Jill Dando.

The household name slammed the handling of her case, saying some officers 'didn't have the faintest idea' of how to deal with 'cases involving harassment against women'.

The well-known presenter, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said she was left 'repulsed' after her stalker allegedly kissed her on the cheek at an event at the O2 arena, London.

The well-known TV presenter, who cannot be named for legal reasons, has criticised the police handing of her case after she was kissed on the cheek by her stalker (pictured, face pixelated) at the O2 Arena last year

She claims the man asked her for an autograph while she was waiting to go on stage with her colleagues last year, before he leaned in for a kiss which left her 'smeared with saliva'. 

The stalker, who also cannot be identified, had previously bombarded the woman with hundreds of tweets and a stream of emails, claiming they were having a 'cyber affair'. 

He also urged her to leave her husband and marry him instead, the court was told.

Giving evidence at Blackfriars Crown Court this morning, the celebrity criticised the police response to the alleged sex assault.

She said: 'I was frustrated by the pace of the police investigation.

'The officers who brought the case to court have been excellent, but there were officers before who I have to say didn't have the faintest idea of how to handle cases involving harassment against women.'

She told the jury she was moments away from joining other big names on stage for the charity event at the O2 arena in east London when the approached her.

She said: 'He lunged at me with such a wet kiss - I had to wipe it off afterwards. Saliva was smeared across my cheek.

The woman, who is a household name, told Blackfriar's Crown Court (pictured) that some officers 'didn't have the faintest idea of how to handle cases involving harassment against women'

'I felt humiliated, not only has he come in to make close contact, he has smeared this saliva on my cheek. I felt repulsed by it.'

The presenter made the claims during cross-examination by Karen Walton, defending, who suggested the kiss was an innocent 'peck on the cheek' or 'a very flamboyant air kiss.'

However, the celebrity replied: 'He has written in emails how he wants to be my cyber husband, he wants to marry me and be my husband.

'He has talked in explicit terms about me so of course there is a sexual element to what he did.'

She reported the incident to police and television network bosses subsequently banned her from taking public transport to work.

The man denies one count of stalking and another of sexual assault. The trial continues.
