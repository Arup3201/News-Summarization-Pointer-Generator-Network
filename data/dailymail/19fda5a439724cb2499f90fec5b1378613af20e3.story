The Japanese man accused of raping and murdering Briton Lindsay Hawker apologised to her parents yesterday for causing her death – but insisted it was an accident.

Tatsuya Ichihashi, 32, spoke at the opening of his trial over the death of the 22-year-old English teacher at his Tokyo apartment.

Her parents Bill and Julia Hawker, from Brandon, Warwickshire, arrived in Japan on Sunday with their two other daughters, Lisa and Louise, to attend the trial in the Tokyo suburb of Chiba.

In court Ichihashi knelt on the floor 
and bowed his head in their direction. Later he said tearfully: ‘I had 
no intention of murdering her, but I’m responsible for the death of Miss
 Lindsay. I’m the one who scared her and left her dead. I’m really, 
really sorry.’

The accused man - one of her students
 - was arrested in Osaka, in western Japan, on November 10, 2009 and has
 been in custody since.

The
 defense argued that Ichihashi tried to revive Miss Hawker after suffocating 
her by accident in an attempt to keep her from crying out for help from 
the neighbours.

Ichihashi, however, admitted to tying her up and raping her.

Looking for justice: The family murdered British teacher Lindsay Hawker arrive at a Japanese court for the trial of the man who has confessed to her murder: (L-R) Her mother Julia, father Bill and sisters Lisa and Louise

Victim participants: Due to the Japanese judicial system, the Hawkers will be allowed to question Ichihashi during the trial and express their opinion on sentencing

Prosecutors have not yet entered a sentencing demand, but the crime could bring the death penalty.

Miss Hawker's parents Bill and Julia are attending the trial at Chiba District Court. 

'I'm here to get justice for my daughter,' said Mr Hawker.

'It's been a long time coming.'

For
 Miss Hawker's family, their trip to Japan is the first time they has 
visited Japan together since 2009, when they marked the second 
anniversary of the death of their daughter, a Leeds University graduate.

Before
 leaving Heathrow to travel to Japan, Mr Hawker of Brandon, near 
Coventry, Warwickshire, gave a brief statement, saying: 'We are a very 
strong family and we're going to see this through to the end.

Under the Japanese system the Hawkers
 will be classed as 'victim participants' and will be able, at the 
discretion of the court, to question the defendant and give their 
opinion on sentencing.

They will also be able, for example, to ask to examine the prosecution evidence.

In January Ichihashi promised to donate the proceeds of a book in which he confessed to the killing to Miss Hawker's family.

It detailed how he spent two and a half years on the run following the murder and how he used false identities and underwent plastic surgery to change his appearance.

Ichihashi also apologised to Miss Hawker's family, claiming he wrote the book as 'a gesture of contrition for the crime I committed'.

He doesn't describe the crime or his motives in the book, titled Until the Arrest, instead detailing his life at large, during which he traveled up and down the country, in constant fear of arrest and obsessed with cosmetic surgery.

It tells how he scissored off his 
lower lip, dug two moles out of his cheek with a box cutter and even 
gave himself a nose job in an attempt to obscure his identity.

He also claimed to have embarked on a
 pilgrimage tour of temples on the south-western island of Shikoku, 
wishing Miss Hawker could 'come back to life'.

He was finally arrested in Osaka while waiting for a ferry to Okinawa.

The Japanese court, in Chiba, will 
work in much the same way as the English system, Kenichi Kinukawa, the 
lawyer representing the family, said.

On the first day of the trial the defendant heard the charges and gave his plea to the allegations.

The major differences with the UK courts are the victim participation system and the saiban-in (lay judge) jury system.

The lay judge system sees members of 
the public selected to participate in the most serious trials, working 
together with professional judges to determine guilt or innocence and 
sentence.

The verdict in the case is expected to be given on July 21.

The trial continues.
