Chelsea defender Branislav Ivanovic says the Premier League can play a big part in Serbia qualifying for Euro 2016.

The 30-year-old is one of six Serbians plying their trade in England's top league, after Lazar Markovic joined Liverpool and Dusan Tadic moved to Southampton this summer.

And Ivanovic believes the experience of football at the highest level could boost the national team's chances of qualifying for a major tournament. 

Pointing the way: Premier League stars like Ivanovic and Kolarov can bring experience for Serbia

Decisive: Ivanovic insists that Serbia must qualify for Euro 2016 and will need to be more consistent

'It is a decisive moment for Serbian football,' said Ivanovic ahead of his country's fixture against France on Sunday.

'With more teams than ever participating in the European championship, nothing less than a berth in the finals will do.

'It is good that six players who represent the national team's backbone ply their trade in the Premier League but it also adds pressure to prove that we can be as successful at international level.

'We have been too inconsistent in the past and still have a lot to learn as a group. There is room for improvement.'

Ivanovic is joined in the Serbia squad by Chelsea teammate Nemanja Matic, Manchester city defensive duo Matija Nastasic and Aleksandar Kolarov, as well as Tadic and Markovic.
