The New York City marathon is back, and with it is a renewed focus on security.

Taking lessons learned from the Boston Marathon bombings, authorities and marathon organizers have doubled down on the use of surveillance cameras, bomb sniffing dogs, scuba divers, and even counterterrorism agents.

The heightened security, which includes almost 2,000 cameras, was announced during a Friday afternoon press conference held jointly by the New York Police Department and the New York Road Runners club.

‘This will be the best-protected race that they can enter,’ said police commissioner Ray Kelly.

The sweeping changes are part of an overhaul that doubled the marathon’s security budget to more than $1million, officials said.

Of all the changes along the 26.2-mile route, the most important is the access officials will have to almost every inch of the race and spectators should the unthinkable happen.

In addition to hundreds of strategically positioned temporary cameras, as well as the use of permanent cameras, officials have fingered over 1,400 private-sector cameras they can access.

‘We are well positioned to stop it and certainly apprehend someone who's engaged in it,’ Mr Kelly added while surrounded by giant monitors displaying different part of the course.

Racers and spectators have been banned from wearing costumes that include masks, a tradition some have long partaken in, officials added.

Extra eyes needed: Security footage of the Boston Marathon bombing was key to identifying the accused attackers

Boston officials were able to quickly identify and hunt down marathon bombing suspects Tamarlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in the days after the attack, mainly a result of footage and spectator pictures made public.

New York officials met with their Boston counterparts in the months leading up the New York Marathon to help plan security measures for Sunday’s event, the first in two years after last year's race was cancelled in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy.

‘The safety and security of our runners and spectators has always been of highest priority and following the tragedy in Boston we’ve taken a deeper look at what can be done to enhance those plans,’ a race spokesperson said in a statement.

No specific threats have been identified, but authorities are still pulling out all the stops to ensure safety for both spectators and the 45,000-plus athletes competing in Sunday’s race.

The most surprising moment of the press conference came when a bomb sniffing black Labrador named Ray was brought in to demonstrate the effective of the 43 dogs deployed along the route.

It took Ray only seconds to locate a person holding a small amount of black powder in the middle of the packed briefing.

Security measures are not just limited to the ground, significant resources are being poured into the city’s waterways as well.

Extra steps have included an unspecified number of scuba divers sweeping bridge supports for explosives, as well as police boat patrols and counterterror agents escorting runners taking the ferry to the Staten Island start line, said officials.

Divers began sweeping various sites on Thursday, the commissioner noted.

Extra helicopters have also been added to an always-robust airborne security presence as well, Mr Kelly noted.

‘We are well equipped and well deployed,’ said the commissioner.

Other security measures will include more rigorous bag searches, extra security guards, plain clothes officers and number of other undisclosed actions, officials added.

The New York Fire Department is even on alert and has trained for ‘terrorist-type activity,’ an FDNY spokesperson added.

‘People will feel a nice added measure in a way that feels supportive and not stifling,’ race director Mary Wittenberg told USA Today.

Despite the added hassle of passing through metal detectors, being limited to only one bag and various other restrictions, most runners were in favor of the added security.

'It will obviously cause some problems for us, but that doesn't matter,’ marathon veteran Runar Gundersen told CNN. ‘Security must come first, so I gladly accept delays... I think most runners do.’

Mr Gunderson will be running in his 35th New York City Marathon, CNN noted.

Shalane Flanagan, running in New York for the first time, agreed.

‘I don't think it affects things in a negative way, I think it just makes people on their toes and appreciate when things run smoothly,’ she told USA Today.

Best-laid plans: Officials and runners alike feel this is the safest race they can enter

Another runner, Kenyan Parliament member Wesley Korir, understands first-hand the importance of added security measures.

The veteran runner finished fifth in this year’s Boston Marathon, and his home country is still suffering from the fallout of September’s Westgate Mall attack, which left more than 70 people dead.

‘It is not fun to come here and be checked when you're coming in,’ Mr Korir told USA Today, ‘but it is something that's a wakeup call that we live in a world that is going somewhere that we don't like.’

Likely speaking the minds of many, Mr Korir added that runners are not easily scared off.

‘They will never defeat us. They will never intimidate us. They are targeting the wrong group of people.’

More than 45,000 runners stand as proof – but should the worst happen, New York is ready.
