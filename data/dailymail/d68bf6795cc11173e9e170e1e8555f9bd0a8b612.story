Fashion-savvy gentlemen who are heading to the spring races this year are being encouraged to flaunt patterns, bright colours and the quirkiest of accessories, rather than hide behind boring suits.

Myer's menswear ambassador Kris Smith has even gone as far as to suggest ‘pocket watches and monocles’ to stand out from the crowd for 2014's Fashion on the Fields, according to the Australian Financial Review.

Contrasting patterns and colours is another trendy tip coming from a range of designers including Tom Ford.

The American designer's collection for this season features clean tailored suits worn as a staple garment while contrasting shirts and ties work as the outfit's feature statement.

Karen Brewster, Myer Group General Manager for Menswear and Childrenswear, told Daily Mail Australia that when it comes to prints - be it geometrics, paisley, spots or even floral - 'the smaller the better! They're being shrunk for the season ahead'.

Cool blue hues from from aqua through to navy have also been recommended as the way to go by Ms Brewster as well as designer Dom Bagnato, whose collection predominantly features the colour while maintaining a mixture of patterns.

If blue is too boring...

Shortened trousers have also hit the look-books for 2014's warmer seasons.

The trend means more focus will be placed on men's socks and shoes this spring.
