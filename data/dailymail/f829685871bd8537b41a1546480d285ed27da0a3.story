Neat stay: One third of Brits tidy and do the washing up of their hotel rooms

A hotel stay should be a chance to relax in luxury, put your feet up and have a night off doing the dishes.

But one in three British hotel guests are too polite to leave the chores to hotel staff and admitted making the bed, tidying up and washing up tea cups before checking out of their rooms.

And 10 per cent of Brits said they would try to make a maid’s life easier by avoiding wearing the hotel robe or using the tea making facilities.

In a survey done by Appy Hotel some 
British hotel guests said they would rather avoid face-to-face 
interaction with hotel staff if there is a problem.

Younger
people in particular prefer not to trouble hotel workers, and 73 per 
cent would rather deal with a problem themselves than ask for help.

And
15 per cent said if they forgot directions given to them by the 
concierge they would rather stride off in the direction they thought 
they had been told, than ask a second time.

A
third of British hotel guests said they would prefer to ask for help 
over the phone, or using a mobile or tablet app than speak to hotel 
staff in person.

Other 
trends which emerged included guests carrying their own bags to avoid 
troubling the porter, not asking the concierge for help and guests 
apologising for things that are not their fault.

Isabella
Glendinning, of Appy Hotel, said: ‘The research really supports the 
classic British stereotype of a culture that is too polite to ask for 
help, going to lengths to avoid putting others out and creating more 
work for hotel staff.

No trouble: Many British guests also carry their own bags to avoid troubling the porter and are reluctant to ask the concierge for help

‘While some of the findings reveal humorous and quirky behaviour traits, hotels can really help to make the guest experience more enjoyable by offering alternative platforms of communication.

‘This is an indication that not only do hotel guests shy away from direct confrontation with hotel staff, they are also adopting and adapting to new forms of communication when it comes to obtaining information.

‘The importance of mobile and tablet apps are continuing to grow, as hotel goers look to embrace the new technology available, to save them time and money.

‘This is a feature that hoteliers should also look to embrace to provide the best all-round experience for their guests.’
