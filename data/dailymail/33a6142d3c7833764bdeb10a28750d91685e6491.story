A Hungarian farmer spent winter building a working car out of wood instead of whiling away the time in the pub.

Istvan Puskas, 51, was encouraged to tackle the project by his wife Iren, who felt the cold dark months could be better spent.

Now, the couple are allowed to drive around the lanes of their village Tiszaors by local police in their timber tractor, though it cannot get a vehicle licence.

Istvan Puskas built his car out of wood following encouragement from his wife Iren

Mr Puskas, a farmer from Hungary, began building the car at Christmas

Istvan Puskas used winter farming breaks to build his new motor, taking four months in total

The car's engine comes from a Fiat 126 while the steering wheel was taken from an old Mercedes-Benz.

The rest of the car, including the frame, gears and axles, are timber, while the petrol tank was made out of a beer barrel.

'I love to work with wood. And I like to create unique things which attract interest from people,' Mr Puskas told Associated Press.

'My aim was to make it out of wood as much as possible. A wooden car must be made from wood.'

The project kept him busy during winter farming breaks, he said, taking four months to complete.

Mrs Puskas said: 'Men in this village sit at home, play with the computer, or I don't know what they do.

'A lot of them are in the pub. There's not much to do here.'

Iren Puskas encouraged her husband to take on the challenge for something different to do besides drinking

The wooden wagon won't be with the couple for much longer. Mr Puskas, who previously built a functioning bicycle from wood, plans to sell the vehicle to fund his next pet project: a three-wheeled car.

'Most probably I will sell it. I have no place to store it,' he said.

'I have no garage, I have nothing. It can be good for a collector, for somebody who likes nostalgia, for somebody who likes to drive slowly.'

The timber creation even has a horn and lights - some of the few non-wooden parts
