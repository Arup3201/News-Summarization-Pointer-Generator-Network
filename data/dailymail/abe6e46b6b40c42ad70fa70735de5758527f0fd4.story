Philadelphia has become the first city in America to ban 3D-printed guns amid fears such bootlegged firearms could fuel a surge in violent crime.

Lawmakers of America's fifth biggest city passed a bill on Thursday, six months after the blueprint for the 3D gun known 
as the Liberator was made available online by the group 
Defense Distributed.

In May, the State Department demanded the
 design be taken offline on the basis that they could violate possible 
arms trafficking violations, but not before it was downloaded more than 
100,000 times.

'It’s all pre-emptive,' spokesman Steve Cobb, director of legislation for bill-author Kenyatta Johnson, told Philly Magazine. 'It’s just based upon internet stuff out there.'

No toy: It comes six months after the blueprint for the 3D gun known as the Liberator was made available online by the group Defense Distributed

New technology: An Ultimaker 3-D printer. The blueprints, that can be produced on a 3-D printer costing as little as $1,000, were seen as a breakthrough because no one has previously designed such a weapon that could withstand the pressure of firing modern ammunition

According to FBI crime statistics, Philadelphia reported 331 murders in 2012, ranking it among the most violent cities in the US.

The decision comes a week after the Liberator was deemed a serious safety and security concern after a gun printed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms exploded before it was even fired.

The blueprints, that can be produced on a 3-D printer costing as little as $1,000, were seen as a breakthrough because no one has previously designed such a weapon that could withstand the pressure of firing modern ammunition.

The bureau released the results of its tests on the Liberator after posting a series of videos on the tests to YouTube.

The weapon was found to have the power to penetrate several inches of flesh as well as a human skull.

'The
 bottom line is, the penetration results demonstrated that the Liberator
 is a lethal weapon,' Earl Griffith, chief of ATF's firearms technology 
branch told the Huffington Post.

'The .380 bullets fired from the Liberator penetrate sufficiently to reach vital organs and perforate the skull.'

The ATF printed several versions of the gun using different materials.

Explosive: The Liberator made from Visijet exploded during testing

The gun printed in a plastic material called Visijet exploded during the test.

But a gun rendered in a stronger plastic known as ABS shot eight rounds without any problems.

'[The
 testers] quit after eight rounds, but there was no issue with the 
firearm at that point,' ATF spokesperson Tim Graden told Forbes.

Authorities
 say the guns are a particular concern because they're made of plastic 
which is undetectable, meaning they could be brought into areas where 
weapons would normally be banned such as airports, schools and courts.

Depending
 on the metal detector, a bullet might not be enough to set it off, and 
the only way the gun itself could be detected would be with an X-ray 
machine, which aren't used in many facilities.

The gun manages to bypass the 
Undetectable Firearms Act by including a metal block in its make-up. 
However, the metal part of the gun doesn't play any part in its function
 and could be removed.

Undetectable: Authorities are concerned that plastic 3-D guns could be brought into places such as schools or government buildings where metal detectors wouldn't find them

New threat: A Liberator pistol next to the 3D printer on which its components were made. The single-shot handgun is the first firearm that can be made entirely with plastic components forged with a 3D printer

The 
Undetectable Firearms Act of 1988 expires early next month, and there is
 a push to have the law updated to account for printed plastic guns.

New York Congressman Steve Israel told the Washington Post that he's making a 'last-ditch effort' to renew and update the law.

'It would be unfathomable to me if we are not able to renew thiws law right now,' he said.

ATF
 spokesperson Tim Graden outlined the bureau's concerns to Forbes: 'One,
 they do work. Two, they’re not reliable, and three, they’re 
undetectable,' says Graden.

'And that’s a safety and security issue because they can make their way into secure facilities.'
