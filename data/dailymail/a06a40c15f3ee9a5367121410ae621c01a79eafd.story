Per Mertesacker says that a frank team meeting between the defenders has sorted out the problems that bedevilled Arsenal's first leg of their Champions League tie against Monaco.

The Gunners face Monaco on Tuesday night knowing they must score at least three times after their 3-1 defeat at the Emirates Stadium last month.  

But Mertesacker, the Arsenal vice-captain claims that the response of the team since that result – with four straight wins, including the FA Cup sixth-round victory at Manchester United, and in conceding just two goals since then – is an indication that the team is ready to overturn the two-goal deficit and produce an extraordinary comeback.

'We speak a lot to each other, even when we win,' said Mertesacker. 'We need to learn after defeat and winning. We always try to improve as a defensive unit. It’s always a topic to analyse things that went right and things went wrong.

‘After that game lot of things didn’t go well. That is a mental thing for tomorrow. We know mentally that we weren’t really up for it and at times we could feel there was a bit of pressure and we couldn’t really cope with that. 

'But we feel after the game we moved on from that and that’s why we’re confident we can beat any team in the world.

‘We’re coming out of great week with two important wins and a good level of confidence. There is always a good mood in the squad and during the season we’ve responded well. But we have to face truth and show a different face tomorrow. We need to embrace the challenge.'
