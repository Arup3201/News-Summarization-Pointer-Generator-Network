A high school student has stunned his girlfriend by renting a billboard to ask her to be his prom date.

Emily Arabia gasped and screamed after noticing the massive poster at one of the busiest intersections in Evansville, Indiana bore her face and the question: 'Emily, prom with me?'

Footage taken by friends shows her hugging her boyfriend, Chase Brown, after seeing the billboard - before saying yes to his proposal.

Creative: Chase Brown surprised girlfriend Emily Arabia by asking her to their junior prom on a billboard

Shock: A video captured by friends shows Emily screaming as she sees the message for the first time

'I knew from the beginning that she wanted something big and, well, she got it,' Brown, a junior at Memorial High School, told WEHT.

'It was about the biggest thing I could think of besides renting a plane.'

So
 he rented a Lamar Advertising billboard for two days to post the message, which 
included his proposal, their images and 'yes' and 'no' tick boxes.

The pair have only been dating for six months, yet he said he started planning the surprise three months ago.

His girlfriend said she never expected anything quite so extravagant.

'I was thinking something 
in my driveway or something in front of my friends,' Arabia said, smiling. 'Not in front of 
all of Evansville.'

Success: Emily, who has been dating Brown for six months, gave him the answer he was hoping for

A Lamar spokesperson said that Brown purchased 
space on the digital billboard for two days, and that the average three-day rate for a
 digital billboard in that location is around $1,200.

'Advertising rates vary depending on location, size, market, campaign duration [and] demand,' she added.

'Given
 all the expenses associated with going to Prom - tickets, attire, 
flowers, dinner, maybe shared limo rental, etc. - the cost of the 
digital billboard could be minor in the grand scheme of the overall cost
 of Prom!'

Brown said 'it wasn't that big of a deal' and is now looking forward to the prom in April.

The happy couple later posed beneath another billboard that read: 'Emily and Chase are going to prom!'
