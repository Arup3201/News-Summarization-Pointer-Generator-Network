Legendary radio DJ Casey Kasem's wife pleaded Monday with her lawyers to not let her husband die shortly before a ruling was handed down demanding he be fed, hydrated and medicated.

Jean Kasem attended the hearing to argue for her ailing husband to receive nourishment while a court-appointed attorney evaluates his health of the ailing radio personality after daughter Kerri Kasem moved to implement end of life measures.

Casey Kasem is in critical condition at a Washington hospital while suffering through a combination of dementia and infections that are exacerbated by feeding and hydrating him, lawyers for Kerri kasem argued.

'Please don't let them kill my husband!' Jean Kasem cried out while dropping to her knees in a court corridor, according to NBC News.

Jean Kasem's lawyers also argued he has the will to live and does not want to die.

'[He] signaled to her that he was in distress, grabbed her hand with such strength that the hospital administrator had to peel his fingers off one by one,' one of her lawyers told the judge.

Kerri Kasem has been placed in temporary control of his treatment. She consulted with doctors and decided in recent days to stop giving her father food, water and medications, her attorneys said.

'This is an unusual circumstance,' one of her attorneys explained. 'Feeding and hydration causes him tremendous amounts of pain and further infection and pneumonia.'

Kerri Kasem added that 'only God knows when to take someone.'

Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Daniel Murphy disagreed, and ruled that Casey Kasem should receive the treatments while an attorney appointed by the judge meets with Kasem and his doctors in Washington state.

Kerri Kasem's attorney Troy Martin said the decision to begin end-of-life measures was made after doctors determined that feeding and hydrating the celebrity had become increasingly painful.

Martin said the judge's ruling is likely to cause the former American Top 40 host more pain.

Casey Kasem's wife of 34 years, Jean Kasem, appeared in court and said she supported Murphy's ruling and will ask to be restored as her husband's caretaker.

She lashed out at Kerri Kasem and judges who have found Jean Kasem in contempt for refusing to cooperate with her stepdaughter, who was named Casey Kasem's temporary conservator last month after he was moved to Washington state.

Jean and Kerri Kasem have been fighting in courts in Washington state and Los Angeles over his care, and Jean Kasem further bolstered her case to be given custody over her husband's care by revealing he had stopped giving his daughter money in recent years.

"One of the reasons Mr. Kasem stopped loaning [Kerri Kasem] so much money, as he had through the years, was her involvement with the Church of Scientology,' said another lawyer for Jean Kasem.

'He didn’t want any of his money to go to a church that he and Jeannie and I consider a cult and have a habit of having their members turn over their money for the church.'

Murphy scheduled a hearing for Friday to receive an update about Kasem's health. Jean Kasem's attorney, Steve Haney, said it was unclear how much longer Kasem had to live.

Despite the family acrimony, Murphy said Kerri and Jean Kasem seemed to be doing what was best for Casey Kasem.

‘It appears to the court that all parties have the best interest of Mr. Kasem at heart,’ the judge said.

Kasem gained fame with his radio music countdown shows, American Top 40 and Casey's Top 40. He also was the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon Scooby Doo.

Jean Kasem told reporters outside the courthouse that 'my husband is a great man, he’s a national treasure. He deserves his personal dignity. He’s earned that right.'

Kerri Kasem fired back saying she and all her siblings had been at his bedside in Washington while he slowly suffered the last battle of his life and that she wished her mother would join them.
