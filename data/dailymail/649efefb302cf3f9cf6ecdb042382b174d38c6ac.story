Identified: Grant Adamson, 55, descendant of one of the founding families of Malibu, died in a ballooning accident in Switzerland

Grant Adamson, a Pepperdine University supporter and descendant of a founding family of Malibu, has been identified as the American tourist who was killed in a hot air balloon accident in Switzerland Tuesday.

Pepperdine Vice Dean Shelley Saxer said the school is deeply saddened by Adamson's passing at age 55, and the serious injuries sustained by his wife, Terry, and their daughters, Lauren and Megan.

Swiss police said the hot air balloon carrying Adamson and family crashed into an electric power line while trying to land after a two-hour flight Tuesday morning.

The balloon fell 165 feet in the crash. Local officials are investigating the incident.

Grant Adamson, 55, was a founding member of Pepperdine's Crest Advisory Board, a community support group, and Terry Adamson was a distinguished jurist in residence at the law school.

Their daughters, aged 20 and 24, are students at the school.

Lauren and Megan Adamson underwent surgeries for unspecified life-threatening injuries and are now recovering. Their mother suffered internal injuries and is currently on a ventilator. A relative told The Malibu Times she is expected to have surgery in the coming days.

Swiss police said Mr Adamson, 55, died at the scene. His family were airlifted to a hospital. A 65-year-old hot air balloon pilot was also hospitalized with serious injuries.

The Malibu Times reported that Grant Adamson owned the Mariposa Land Company, which managed the real estate holdings that have been in the family for over a century, and he was a founding member of Pepperdine University’s Crest Board.

Terry Adamson had served as a commissioner at the Malibu Courthouse for nearly two decades until her retirement in 2007. She also worked as an adjunct professor at Pepperdine School of Law.

The family lives in a well-appointed home in the exclusive gated community of Serra Retreat in the hills of lower Malibu Canyon.

Mr Adamson was a descendant of the founding family of Malibu. In 1892, his great-grandparents Frederick and May Knight Rindge purchased the land upon which the city was built.

‘This family owned Malibu,’ resident Andy Stern told NBC Los Angeles. ‘They owned the entire city.’

In 1930, the scion's grandparents Rhoda May 
and Merritt Adamson built Adamson House, known among the locals
 as the ‘Taj Mahal of Tile’ because of its use of ceramic Malibu 
Potteries tiles, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

The 
state bought the property in 1969 and planned to level it in order to 
expand a parking lot by the beach, but the house was saved thanks to the
 efforts of the Malibu Historical Society. In 1985, Adamson House became a California Historical Landmark and opened to the public as a museum.

In
 1968, Rhoda May Adamson donated 132 acres of family ranch land to 
Pepperdine University, where the school opened its oceanfront campus in 
1972 – a magnanimous gesture that has been dubbed by some as the ‘Malibu 
Miracle,’ NBC Los Angeles reported.

‘If there were royalty in Malibu, it would be the Adamsons,’ Malibu Mayor Joan House told the station.

Grant and Terry met in 1977 while attending the University of California, and they were married for 29 years.

Neighbor
 Jeff Follert, who has lived near the Adamsons for more than a dozen 
years, described the patriarch of the influential family as a 
soft-spoken, loving man who was very close to his wife and daughters.

The
 family, which traveled often together, had chartered the hot air 
balloon Tuesday for a day of sightseeing in Chateau-d'Oex - an area known
 as the ballooning capitol of the world.

The craft took off from the Grand Hotel and came down in the hill town of Montbovon after colliding with electric power lines and plummeting 165 feet to earth.

Medics rushed to the scene but were unable to resuscitate Mr Adamson, while his wife and two daughters were taken by helicopter to a nearby hospital with life-threatening injuries.

Police are now investigating whether pilot error could be blamed for the crash, which happened at 8.35am after a two-hour flight.

The 65-year-old pilot also was seriously injured and was taken to the hospital by ambulance.

Perfect home: Mr Rindge (second right) built a large ranch house in Malibu Canyon, beneath present-day Serra Retreat, which he considered the ideal home for his family

Castle: Rindge's daughter, Rhoda Rindge Adamson, lived in this palatial home on Vaquero Hill, which was later sold to the Franciscan Order for $50,000

Grant Adamson came from one of the most prominent families in the state and resided in the same area where his great-grandparents built a life for themselves more than a century ago.

Frederick and May Knight Rindge bought a 13,330-acre tract of land in 1892, where they built their dream home: Rancho Malibu - a working cattle and grain-growing ranch.

When Mrs Knight Rindge lost her husband in 1905, she continued running the family business and spent nearly two decades fighting the state in court to protect her property and keep it private.

Using a loophole, the tenacious widow managed to outsmart a major railroad company seeking to build tracks across her land by starting her own small railroad. But Mrs Rindge was unable to stop the state from constructing two public highways.

Lost battle: Mrs Rindge fought hard to keep the state from building a road across her property, but in 1929,  Roosevelt Highway, now Pacific Coast Highway, opened to the public between Santa Monica and Oxnard

The enterprising woman fought to preserve and increase her family's assets, starting Malibu Potteries to boost revenue and make tiles for two homes she was building at the time.

Rindge's ventures fell on hard times during the Great Depression, and by the time May Knight Rindge died in 1941, her land was in insolvency.

Patriarch: In 1892, Frederick Hastings Rindge and his wife, May Knight Rindge, purchased a 13,330-acre tract of land known as Rancho Malibu

In 1892, Frederick Hastings Rindge and May Knight Rindge, the fourth and last owners of the entire Rancho Malibu, purchased a 13,330-acre tract of land, which they later expanded by buying up the holdings of homesteaders with adjacent property.

Mr Rindge built a large ranch house in Malibu Canyon, beneath present-day Serra Retreat – the home of the Adamsons - to serve as a headquarters for Rancho Malibu. It was a working cattle and grain-raising ranch, which was to become one of the most valuable large real estate holdings in the U.S.

In 1903, the Malibu Canyon home was destroyed by a brush fire, and two years later, Frederick Hastings Rindge died at the age of 48. Following her husband’s passing, May  Rindge took over the management of the family business

May Rindge, dubbed ‘Queen of the Malibu’ by her critics, wanted to be left alone to run her Rancho Malibu, but in 1904, the Southern Pacific Railroad applied to the Interstate Commerce Commission to build tracks linking the Long Wharf in Santa Monica with their northern tracks at Santa Barbara.

Using a loophole in the law, the Rindges were able to save their property by building a private 15-mile-long railroad through Rancho Malibu called the Hueneme, Malibu and Port Los Angeles Railway.

The line was completed in 1908 and remained in use until the 1920s, mainly to ship grains and hides from the ranch operations via the Malibu Pier.

The Rindge family, however, were unable to stop the construction of the County Road through Malibu Ranch, which opened in 1921 after more than a decade of legal battles. More lawsuits followed after the state decided to construct a highway along the coast.

'The Queen of Malibu': When Mrs Knight Rindge lost her husband in 1905, she continued running the family business, opening new ventures and spending nearly two decades fighting the state in court to protect her property and keep it private

Despite May Rindge’s resistance, which at one point even involved armed guards on horseback hired to keep works crews away from her property, Roosevelt Highway, now Pacific Coast Highway, opened to the public between Santa Monica and Oxnard in June 1929.

In 1924-1926 the Rindge Dam was constructed on Malibu Creek and in 1928 May Rindge started construction of a great 50-room house on Laudamus Hill in Malibu Canyon overlooking the sea.

She started Malibu Potteries to make tiles for the Laudamus Hill home and a second home on Vaquero Hill for her daughter, Rhoda Rindge Adamson. During the Great Depression, all of her ventures fell on hard times . When May K. Rindge died February 8, 1941, at the age of 76, her land was in insolvency.

Her unfinished castle along with 26 acres of land and thousands of crated Malibu Potteries tiles were sold to the Franciscan Order for $50,000. Today, it is known as the Serra Retreat House.

Rhoda Rindge Adamson's home on Vaquero Hill was acquired by the California Department of Parks and Recreation in 1969 with the intention of razing it to provide a parking lot for Surfriders Beach.

For 14 years, the Malibu Historical Society fought against the destruction, and through their sustained efforts the property was placed on the National Register of Historic Places. The house, with its 13 garden acres and walls covered with Malibu Potteries tile, was spared to become the Malibu Lagoon Museum.
