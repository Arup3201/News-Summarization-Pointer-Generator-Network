Thousands of patients needing urgent medical treatment could have their conditions diagnosed remotely by doctors using Skype video calls under proposals to close and downgrade Accident and Emergency departments.

Under plans seen by The Mail on Sunday, patients suffering from potentially serious symptoms such as chest and abdominal pains, pneumonia and fractures will be sent to walk-in centres to see GPs rather than go to casualty wards.

But because the centres are staffed by less qualified medics, advice could come from specialist colleagues at a separate A&E ward using Skype calls. The astonishing proposal is among those being considered by the Shropshire Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG), which is planning to centralise emergency services in the region.

The plans mean there could be only one A&E department for more than 600,000 people across Shropshire, Telford, Wrekin and Powys. Campaigners warn it is ‘like death is being built into the system’.

The draft proposals, contained in official documents lodged within the July board minutes of the CCG, also say:

The proposals are the latest planned cuts to casualty units up and down the country, and come despite a new independent report insisting A&E provision needs to expand to meet rising demand for services. The Mail on Sunday has been fighting for two years to save A&Es from closure. The latest threats mean there are now 18 units across England facing the axe. 

Gill George, from the Shropshire Defend Our NHS campaign group, said: ‘This is terrifying and means a death sentence for a lot of people. In a rural area, the idea of centralising everything – with already long travel times to get to A&E – is mad.

‘But there’s got to be a clinical risk in diagnosing patients over Skype because you lose so much crucial information if it’s not done in person. It’s scary they’re building risk – and possibly death – into the system.’

The region currently has two A&E departments – at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and at the Princess Royal in Telford, both district general hospitals. The ‘Future Fit’ programme is examining three options – locating a single A&E at either the Royal Shrewsbury or the Princess Royal, or building a new single A&E at a site between Shrewsbury and Telford. This means patients will have up to travel an additional 18 miles – around 30 minutes – for A&E services. The CCG is considering how many UCCs will be needed.

David Wright, the Labour MP for Telford, said: ‘Residents are extremely concerned to yet again see a review of A&E at a time of large-scale growth in the town. We want to see full, 24-hour A&E services at our hospital and this process brings massive uncertainty.’

The current A&E service is already under pressure and paramedics were forced to wait eight hours, 11 minutes with patients outside a hospital recently because of a shortage of beds. But the ambulance service is also struggling and was fined £2.6 million after failing to meet strict eight-minute targets to reach seriously ill patients on time – one critically ill six-week-old baby had to wait 41 minutes for paramedics. The plans come as a joint report by the respected Nuffield Trust and Health Foundation found the ‘obvious answer’ to dealing with the A&E crisis ‘might appear to be increasing the capacity of A&E’.

A spokesman for Shropshire CCG said: ‘Doctors and health professionals believe one single emergency centre in the area supported by UCCs is the safest way to treat the most seriously ill patients.’

A&E could be ‘ambulance only’ – so walk-in patients would be diverted to an Urgent Care Centre (UCC).

@highlight

Unwell or feverish children would need to go to an UCC rather than A&E – but the report acknowledges that ‘not all GPs and generalists have [the skill set to treat them]’.

@highlight

Paramedics may have to decide on the scene whether patients need to go to hospital or an UCC. But the report also says studies have found paramedics cannot ‘safely and accurately’ predict this.

@highlight

Patients who have attempted suicide, are suffering from potentially life-threatening deep vein thrombosis, and children having a wheezing fit would all be brought to UCCs.

@highlight

UCCs will be dealing with more serious cases, so staff will need specialists on the rota or ‘timely access’ to them via Skype.
