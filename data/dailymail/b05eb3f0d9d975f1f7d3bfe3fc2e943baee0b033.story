A teenager was shocked after she was charged 1p at a branch of Bargain Booze - for showing her ID.

Sian Heather, 19, went into her local off-licence to pick up a bottle of wine and was asked to produce some identification proving she was over 18.

But when the student and bank worker from Eastbourne, East Sussex checked her receipt she discovered she had been charged £2.99 for the bottle of rose wine - and a penny for producing her ID.

Wine fine: Sian Heather, 19, went into her local off-licence to pick up a bottle of wine and was asked to produce some identification proving she was over 18 - and was subsequently charged a penny for doing so

The receipt read: 'SILVER BAY POINT ROSE 75CL £2.99. 'ID check Age Level 25. Over 25

'SUCCESSFUL ID SHOWN £0.01.'

She handed the cashier a £5 note, and received just £2 change.

Ms Heather said: 'I didn't really think of it at the time, to be honest.

'You don't really. I go there all the time because the booze is so cheap, and I quite often get asked for ID, but I've never noticed being charged before.

'It made me wonder just how many times I've had to pay there in the past for the privilege of being old enough to buy alcohol.'

Sian also posted a picture of her receipt on Twitter, and wrote: 'Got charged £0.01 for showing my ID? #what.'

A spokesperson for Bargain Booze said the situation was an isolated incident and should not have happened.

The spokesperson said: 'This is an isolated incident. We never charge customers for ID checks.

'They are registered through our till system against transactions for audit purposes.

'We are working closely with our Eastbourne store to ensure this doesn't happen again and customers who have been charged a penny have been refunded.'
