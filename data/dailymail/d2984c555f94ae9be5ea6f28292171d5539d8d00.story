The father of three Australian children killed on board Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 has taken indefinite leave from his job as head of Buxton Resources.

A brief statement from the Perth-based mining company on Monday said Anthony Maslin was taking personal leave from his job as managing director.

Mr Maslin and his wife Rin returned to Perth at the weekend from Amsterdam, where they had farewelled their three children on the ill-fated flight last Thursday.

The children, Mo, 12, Evie, 10 and Otis, eight, boarded MH17 with their grandfather Nick Norris so they could return to Australia from their European holiday in time to start school this week.

Mr and Mrs Maslin had planned to stay on in Amsterdam for a few more days after their children left.

The family was meant to be reunited today.

Mrs Maslin's father, Nick Norris, was a government consultant who formally worked as a school principal.

The Maslin children's devastated parents flew home on Saturday and attended a public tribute for their children at Mo's junior football club on Sunday.

The Scarborough Sea Eagles Year 7 team played without Mo Maslin, their star forward pocket who had planned on being there for his first game back from his European holiday.

Club President Steve Cross said the whole family would attend Mo's games together and were 'very popular' in the community.

'Being a parent, it really hits home to you. Things in life donâ€™t seem so bad when you see things like this,' Mr Cross told the Courier Mail.

'My heart goes out to Maz (Anthony) and Rin, how do they cope from now on?' Coach Troy Ramshaw told the publication.

12-year-old Mo Maslin's football team hold a minute's silence for their late friend, who was onboard the fateful MH17 flight with his younger sister, Evie, brother Otis and grandfather Nick Norris

12-year-old Mo had played for the football club for three years. His teammates held a minute's silence to remember their friend.

Green, yellow and black balloons - football club's team colours - were released into the air as part of a tribute to the three cherished children and their beloved grandfather.

The three children and their grandfather were among 298 people who died when MH14 was shot down over rebel-held eastern Ukraine.

Mr Norris is survived by his wife Lindy, their four adult children and surviving grandchildren.
