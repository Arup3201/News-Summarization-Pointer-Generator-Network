The ‘comet of the century’, Comet ISON, is now visible to the naked eye- but catch it while you can, as some experts believe it won't be there for long.  

There have been reported sighting of 'wings' coming from the comet, which may suggest that its centre has already broken up.

However, Karl Battams, blogging on Nasa's Comet ISON Observing Campaign, believes there are other possibilities.

A composite image from the European Southern Observatory's TRAPPIST telescope in Chile shows Comet ISON streaking toward the sun on Nov. 15. The image combines four different 30-second exposures of the moving comet in different wavelengths

He claims the wings could be due to dust emissions or tail structures caused by ISON running into high solar winds.

'If the comet has fragmented, we should see some dramatic changes in the next few days,' he added.

'Typically we expect a large increase in brightness followed then by a dramatic decrease in the comet's brightness in these situations.'

On Saturday, the comet was declared as being in 'full outburst mode' after having increased in brightness by a magnitude of two in just 24 hours.

This image was taken in the early hours of this morning just before sunrise above the skies of in northern England. The ball of ice and dust is thought to originate from the Oort cloud and is the first sungrazing comet in 200 years

ISON was spotted in the early hours of this morning two hours before sunrise above the skies of in northern England, and a faint tail can can seen against the clear sky near Barnard Castle, County Durham

A flood of images have come in from 
amateur astronomers, many of whom took images in their back garden with 
just binoculars or small telescopes.

Scientists are now predicting it will get even brighter over the next few weeks, and are encouraging people to get a glimpse of Ison themselves.

The best place to see the ‘comet of the century’ is in a clear dark sky where the horizon is unobstructed, such as in the countryside. 

While it can be seen with the naked eye, binoculars will highlight details such as its tail, streamers and bumps in the surface.

The comet is currently close enough to the sun which means tomorrow, it will close to sunrise before its head appears on the horizon.

ISON, which has been dubbed the 'comet of the century', was visible to the naked eye in November

By the end of the November, it should be seen before dawn in the eastern sky.

On 28th of November, Ison will pass within 1.2 million miles of the sun’s surface before skirting around to where it came.

The comet is already creating a spellbinding cosmic spectacle as ice in its body vapourises and forms a distinct bright tail.

The comet was discovered in September last year by two amateur astronomers using Russia's International Scientific Optical Network, ISON, who marvelled at how bright it was even beyond Jupiter's orbit.

At the end of this month, it will be more than 100 times closer to the sun than the Hale-Bopp comet, one of the brightest of the last century which was visible with the naked eye for a record 18 months, passed at its peak in 1997.

ISON is named after the International Scientific Optical Network, used by a pair of Russian astronomers to detect the comet in September 2012, but it officially is known as C/2012 S1

On 28th of November, Ison will pass within 1.2 million miles of the sun’s surface before skirting around to where it came.

As it blasts towards the sun, the intense gravitational pull will make it speed up to 234 miles per second.

The sun's rays will also heat the ball of ice, metal and rock to 2,760 degrees Celsius, making it much brighter than most comets - with some scientists claiming it could outshine the moon.

Some have warned that the intense pressure on the comet could simply blast it apart, as the heat melts not just the ice but also rock and metal.

A flood of images from both professional and amateur astronomers have been coming in.

It is expected to be visible to the naked eye in early mornings throughout December and during the night in January.

It is currently passing through the constellation Virgo in the east of the morning sky.

Comets are believed to be frozen remains left over from the formation of the solar system four and a half billion years ago.

ISON, which has never visited our inner solar system before, has emerged from the Oort Cloud, a reservoir of icy bodies beyond Neptune's orbit.

These balls of ice are occasionally 'bumped' by the sun's gravity out of the cloud and into a flight path that brings them into the inner solar system.

The vast majority of comets are invisible to the naked eye, but the most famous is Halley's Comet.

That is because it is the only comet which visits often enough and shines brightly enough to be seen by most people in their lifetime.

It comes to our inner solar system between every 75 and 76 years and last visited in 1986. Among other things, it inspired the name of 1950s rock and roll outfit Bill Haley and His Comets.

There is still a chance the comet will not survive its journey close to the sun, but if it does, Astronomers could learn a lot about the comet's composition by observing which gases boil off it as it nears the sun

Some scientists are optimistic the comet will survive as its nucleus is estimated to be up to 1.2 miles across and therefore big enough to weather the sun's heat.
