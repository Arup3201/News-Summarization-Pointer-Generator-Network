It appears One Direction and The Wanted aren't the only British acts making waves across the pond.

One Direction's fellow X Factor alumni Cher Lloyd appears to be following in the boy band's footsteps and has already attracted quite a few followers.

The 18-year-old singer was mobbed by a group of teenage fans as she arrived at the Y100 radio station in Miami yesterday.

Although she's only just started her promotional tour in the U.S., it looks like Cher has won over quite a few admirers already.

During her trip Stateside, she's been tweeting regularly to her 'brats' - her affectionate term for her fans - and imploring them to come and meet her.

But as she arrived at Y100 yesterday, things got a bit heated so security were there to try and calm down the hormonal young fans.

Following her appearance, she took to Twitter to thank her fans: 'Miami was insane!!! thanks to all the brats who came to the station :) who wants a follow?'

In her bid to break the U.S, Cher has had to travel to regional radio stations to create buzz around her single.

She's already visited Houston, Kansas City, St Louis and Milwaukee in Wisconsin.
