Michel Platini insisted that UEFA 'loves FIFA' after he was re-elected unopposed as UEFA president for a third four-year term.

Platini has made it clear he does not support Sepp Blatter standing for a fifth term as FIFA president on May 29 - but he used his acceptance speech to say people are trying to turn the rest of the world against UEFA.

Platini told the UEFA Congress in Vienna: 'This means more to me than you can possibly imagine. I know I can count on you, and you know that you can count on me.

'This allows me to continue for another four years. I do want to say that we love FIFA deeply, and it's precisely because we love and respect FIFA that we want it to be perfect.

'We are only demanding about the people and institutions we care about.'

Addressing the presidents of the other five confederations, he added: 'We want a FIFA that is respectable and respected. Certain people are trying to turn us against each other and isolate us and call us arrogant and selfish Europeans - but don't believe everything you hear.

'We know we are in a privileged position and we will work for the good of the 209 national associations and the good of FIFA as well.

'Whatever the results of May 29, that's why we are going to continue to work together.'
