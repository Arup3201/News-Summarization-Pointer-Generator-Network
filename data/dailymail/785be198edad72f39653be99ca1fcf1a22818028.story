An Indian farmer who was fed up with a leopard attacking her cattle got the better of the creature by setting a homemade trap and capturing the animal.

Baijanti Gogoi of Torajan Betoni village had seen her livestock attacked constantly over the past three months with 20 of her animals preyed upon and killed by the creature.

She complained constantly to forestry officials in Choraipung but her pleas to capture the animal fell on deaf ears.

Ms Gogoi then decided to take matters into her own hands and come up with her own plan to capture the leopard.

She then fashioned a cat trap using items from her around her house which managed to lure and trap the leopard.

Locals in the village are now praising the farmer's bravery, which has not only saved the lives of the remaining animals on her farm but the lives of local people too.
