Police continue to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a young woman who went missing 11 months ago.

Jessica Heeringa, who was 25 years old at the time, went missing on April 26, 2013. She was allegedly abducted while working as a clerk at an Exxon gas station in Norton Shores, Michigan, around 11pm, according to mlive.com.

Norton Shores Police Chief Dan Shaw told the website no one has yet come forward saying they witnessed an abduction. A suspicious vehicle, however, was described by one witness.

'The witness who observed the silver mini-van and its driver did not see Jessica at any time,' Shaw said. 'The witness was not aware of Jessica’s abduction until officers began their initial investigation, therefore, had no reason to believe the van was involved in a crime or to take additional actions, like call 911.'

Shaw also said that investigators believe the silver Chrysler Town and Country mini-van spotted may still be involved.

'Based on the fact the driver has not been identified and the van’s departure from the Exxon store is within the timeline of Jessica’s disappearance, investigators still believe it may be involved,' he said.

The driver is reportedly a 6-foot-tall white man, who may be between 30 and 40 years old. He has a medium to heavy build with broad shoulders and light brown or blond wavy hair with a center part, the website reports.

Heeringa is mother to son Zeven, 4, but he is no longer in contact with her family, Fox17 reported.

Heeringa is also unlikely to have faked an abduction, Shaw said -- since her blood was found at the scene as well as hundreds of dollars.

'Based on evidence obtained at the scene, including Jessica’s blood from the pavement outside of the store, the fact that hundreds of dollars in cash [both Jessica’s and the store’s] was left behind and based on behavioral information we have developed during the investigation, it is highly unlikely that she is intentionally missing,' Shaw told mlive.com.

Shaw also said the case is the department's 'top priority.'

Former members of a task force that was formed to pursue the case after Heeringa vanished continue to work together, Shaw said. The task force included police in Muskegon, the Muskegon County sheriff's department, state police and federal officials.

'Members of the former task force have met on several occasions to review information received and the investigative reports compiled since it was disbanded to help ensure a comprehensive review has been conducted,' Shaw said.

The reward for information is up to $15,160. Anyone with tips is asked to contact either Silent Observer at 231-722-7463 or the Norton Shores Police Department at 231-733-2691.
