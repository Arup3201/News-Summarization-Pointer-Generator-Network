A father accidentally knocked down and killed his toddler daughter outside their home after being distracted by the family dog, an inquest has heard.

Sixteen-month-old Angel Pitts tragically died when she wandered in front of the family car outside her home in Leeds, West Yorkshire, last June.

An inquest into her death heard how father, Scott Pitts, 36, was calling his partner to fetch the family's Jack Russell from the road when the accident happened.

Angel Pitts was tragically knocked down and killed when her father accidentally drove into her last summer

The little girl - who had only just learned to walk - was found underneath the family's Toyota Avensis by her devastated father.

He initially thought he had hit one of children's garden toys left on the drive, the hearing was told.

Sergeant Carl Quinn, from West Yorkshire Police's Collision Investigation Unit, told the coroner: 'Scott got into his vehicle to go and collect a DVD for the family to watch later that evening.

'Angel was in the house watching TV. He went forward when the dog followed him out of the gate. He called to Megin to fetch it inside. Angel had apparently left the house unseen by anyone.

'She walked into the road to the near side of the vehicle within the path of the turning car - she was struck by the near side front wheel resulting in a knock to the ground and injuries to her head.

'Scott realised he had impacted with something which he thought was one of the children's toys. As he looked he found Angel underneath the car by the front wheels.'

Mr Pitts' partner Megin Darch told police in interview: 'Scott shouted at me to pick up the dog as he didn't want to run it over so I went out to pick it up. It always runs in the road.

'Shortly after I heard a scream. He was screaming 'help me, help me'.'

Mr Pitts thought his daughter was inside the family home in Leeds, West Yorkshire at the time of the accident

Neighbour Craig Holmes said he heard a man screaming for help from across the road and looked out to see Scott carrying the little girl as his partner Megin Darch rushed out and wailed.

Recording a verdict of accidental death, Assistant Coroner Jonathan Leach said he was satisfied Scott Pitts had not been able to see the youngster in front of the car.

In a statement read to the Leeds court, Ms Darch said: 'Angel was tragically killed in a terrible accident. She was very happy at home, she would bounce up and down on her trampoline.

'Angel was very clingy with me. She was a very good girl, good-natured and ate well. She was no trouble at all and got on well with all the family and her brother.

'Scott has been very affected - he says he is okay but I don't think that he is. I've told him it's not his fault it was an accident. He thinks I hate him but I don't.

'I'm devastated about what happened but I carry on for my son's sake.

'I cannot really describe how I have felt since the accident. We miss Angel so much and we will never forget her.'

The family paid tribute to the infant by dressing in onesies at a Disney-themed funeral, which was attended by crowds of mourners from the shocked community.

Angel's mother said the death has had a huge impact on the family, saying: 'We will never forget her'
