A mother who gave birth to her daughter three months prematurely because she is terminally ill with cancer has so far received $275,000 in donations to help pay her medical bills. 

Michelle Buchholtz, 38, gave birth to Ava at 29 weeks in Melbourne on November 14 so she could undergo further cancer treatment as her health slowly deteriorated.

In a bid to buy the family more time together, her fiancé Alex Ansalone set up a crowd funding website to raise $50,000 to help cover the bills for further treatment.

But in just over a week the donations have quickly surpassed what the couple ever could have imagined.

'It's just fantastic. Obviously we started just trying to get money for treatment for Michelle but this money will go a long way,' Mr Ansalone told Daily Mail Australia.

'Looking to the long-term as a family, Ava is going to be coming home in the first or second week in January. I'm hoping to take some time off and spend it with my family.'

Ava was born via caesarean weighing just 1kg as Ms Buchholtz lay in the hospital bed wearing a neck brace due to fractures caused by her many tumours.

But despite the circumstances, Mr Ansalone said mother and baby were doing well.

The couple hope to have baby Ava home in the first or second week of January as doctors and nurses are happy with her progress so far

'Ava is doing really well, she's doing all she needs to do. The nurses and doctors are really happy with her progress,' he said. 

'We see Ava every day for maybe four or five hours. We're quite spoilt with that – I didn't think you could get her out of the incubator at that early stage.' 

The new parents constantly get skin-to-skin contact with their daughter and have been documenting everything on camera.

'Michelle had her last radiation therapy on Wednesday and she starts chemotherapy on Friday,' Mr Ansalone said. 

'She's obviously feeling pretty tired right now and it's hard for her to get around. She's been in a wheelchair since before the birth because her hips were too sore from the tumours.'

Ms Buchholtz was first diagnosed with breast cancer after the couple returned from a trip to Europe in October 2012. 

The cancer returned when she was pregnant with Ava. In two months, 12 new tumours have grown and spread into her neck, back, pelvis, hip and thigh.  

'We've been told her prognosis is not good and there's no cure,' Mr Ansalone said.

'Ava has really helped us through this time.'

The couple are now making plans to tie the knot if Ms Buchholtz's health permits.

'We were supposed to get married a few times but Michelle was sick and now with Ava in the hospital... Michelle wants to do it before she loses her hair, which could be in a matter of weeks,' he said. 

'It's something we really want to do, but it's going to depend on health circumstances.' 

But Ms Buchholtz is certainly giving it her best shot to stay healthy for as long as she can.

'With the radiation and chemotherapy treatments she's been receiving, it damages good cells. She has to do a lot of other things to keep the good cells healthy,' he said.

'She is doing all she can - cell repair, oxygenating cells and keeping her body in the best way. She's taking 30-40 supplements each day.'

The couple had already terminated two pregnancies before Ava's birth - once during her first fight with an aggressive stage four breast cancer in 2012.

They stored Ms Buchholtz's eggs before she underwent chemotherapy and had a double mastectomy.  

Ms Buchholtz and Mr Ansalone decided to try again for baby Ava when Ms Buchholtz thought she was finally cancer free.

But 17 weeks into the pregnancy, her cancer returned and doctors said it had spread to her spine.
