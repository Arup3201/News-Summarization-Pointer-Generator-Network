Danny Welbeck doesn't need to worry about missed chances since joining Arsenal, with Arsene Wenger refusing to 'make a problem' out of opportunities wasted. 

The England striker signed for the Gunners on deadline day for £16million from Manchester United and has struggled in front of goal during his first two outings for the club. 

Welbeck hit the post during the draw against Manchester City on Saturday and might've found the net against Dortmund in the Champions League.

Welbeck could only hit the post when put in the clear against Manchester City at the Emirates on Saturday 

Wenger's side were soundly beaten in Germany, but would have gone ahead had the 23-year-old not fluffed his lines when one-on-one with Roman Weidenfeller. 

The manager, however, wouldn't criticise his new man.

'Danny will improve - we don't have to make a problem of that,' Wenger said. 'He had a very lively first half. He had two or three good chances, but couldn't finish them. There was one obvious one... We have to be patient with him.'

Wenger has a point given experience. Thierry Henry - the club's greatest striker of all-time - didn't find the net in any of his first eight games for the club after moving from Juventus. Similarly to Welbeck, the Frenchman had played the majority of his early career wide. 

And in truth, Arsenal have bigger problems given the way in which they were over-run in midfield at Dortmund.  

'It's very difficult to go into any individual assessment of any player because as a team we were not at the requested level,' Wenger added. 'They were very, very strong in midfield, yes, stronger than us in midfield. It was very difficult...'
