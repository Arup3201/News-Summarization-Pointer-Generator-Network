A burglary ring targeted homes of newspaper subscribers who were away on vacation stealing 'everything from televisions right down to the toothpaste,' authorities said today.

The three-year-long operation allegedly netted the men $1 million, police said.

Duane Van Tuinen worked in a distribution center that distributed the Los Angeles Times and somehow managed to get a list of readers who put holds on their accounts.

'Everything from televisions to toothpaste': Police said there are at least 25 victims but may be as many as 100. The operation last for three years

Van Tuinen, 51, then worked with at least three others, Randall Whitmore, 43, Joshua Box, 43, and Edwin Valentine, 52, to case the homes of people they knew to be out of town, authorities said.

Investigators have recovered at least $100,000 worth of personal property, including artwork, golf clubs and guitars - most of which was packed into a storage facility - during the six-month investigation, police said.

'They took everything from televisions right down to the toothpaste,' a police spokesman said.

But police believe the thieves stole many more items, including jewelry and collectible coins that they later sold, the Los Angeles Times reported.

Police have identified at least two dozen victims but believe there may be more than 100.

A police spokesman said most of the break-ins occurred along the 210 Freeway in eastern L.A. County and western San Bernardino County.

They are asking other newspaper subscribers who believe they are victims to come forward.

Van Tuinen's mother, Lois Van Tuinen, told a local television station that she's not surprised her son has been charged since he had robbed her multiple times, according toÂ CBS Los Angeles.

She added that he has a problem with drugs, mostly meth.

The operation started to unravel about six months ago when police arrested one suspect with stolen property and a list of addresses.

They eventually determined it was a list of homes of LA Times subscribers but initially suspected the paper had been hacked.

The LA Times said it is fully cooperating with authorities during their investigation.

'The Times sympathizes with those who have been harmed and joins the other victims in thanking the Sheriff's Department for their hard work,' they said in a statement.
