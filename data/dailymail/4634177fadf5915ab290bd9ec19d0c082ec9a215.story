Addiction: Wilkie turned to online poker while depressed and suspended from work

A high flying headmaster who stole £53,000 of school funds to finance his gambling addiction was jailed for 16 months today.

A court heard how father of three Andrew Thomas Wilkie, 41, became depressed after he was suspended over a child's accusation of sexual misconduct.

Following a full police investigation no action was taken against him, and he was allowed to return to school.

But, the court heard, the police 
probe had taken its toll and he secretly turned to online poker, often 
playing into the early hours of the morning.

He
blew the family’s £90,000 savings, then the £70,000 he got by 
remortgaging the family home without his wife's knowledge, and finally 
turned to the school's fund.

Mold Crown Court, sitting at Chester, heard how Wilkie knew that the charitable fund was operated within the school and not subject to LEA auditing.

After he gambled away the funds a proposed extension to the school hall at Southdown Primary School, in Buckley, had to be put on hold.

Two anonymous letters were received by Flintshire LEA and following the tip-off Wilkie - at the school for 17 years, the last three as headmaster - was told an emergency audit would take place.

He cleared his desk and went home to confess to his pregnant wife what he had done and that they were in financial ruin, explained prosecuting barrister James Coutts.

Wilkie then sent a text to the chair of governors, Martin Bradley, asking him to come around urgently.

In a second text he said: 'It is very big. I have done something very wrong that is going to have big consequences for you and for the school.'

Mr Bradley went to see him that evening and was left in a state of shock and disbelief.

Suspended: Southdown Primary School, in Buckley, Flintshire, Wales. The school's head teacher David Wilkie stole from its funds to finance his online poker habit

Wilkie, who was immediately suspended, apologised and said that he wanted to pay the money back.

Mr Coutts said: 'He unburdened himself to Mr Bradley and said it began about a year earlier, following a criminal investigation into the defendant. He was unable to sleep and turned to school funds after he exhausted his own finances.'

'He did not tell anyone about his gambling addiction and did not get any help because he was embarrassed.'

The headmaster had been so trusted that other signatories signed blank cheques.

He photocopied one and made up a legitimate reason for spending it, while the real cheque was paid into his own account. He had also used school computers to transfer money to himself.

Arrested and interviewed last October, he said that he used poker websites in the early hours or when home alone.

Mr Bradley had since taken him to Gamblers Anonymous.

Wilkie admitted two theft charges with eight similar offences taken into consideration, amounting to £53,438.

Defence barrister Patrick Williamson said Wilkie had been a highly successful headmaster and that the school performed well in inspections.

'He was extremely dedicated to his work - and it may be at the expense of his family life,' he said.

Wilkie was suspended after an allegation of sexual misconduct in July 2010, and for ten days he was even banned from returning home to see his own children.

When he returned that December, his accusers were still in school and his requests for help from the LEA fell on deaf ears.

'He became more mistrustful and withdrawn. There was a tangible difference between the Andrew Wilkie who was headmaster before he was suspended and the one who returned to school,' Mr Williamson said.

Judge Merfyn Hughes QC said that it was a very sad but a very serious case.

'The most significant aggravating feature is that you were in a position of trust. Given your role as headmaster it was a high degree of trust,' the judge said.

'The funds that ought to have been used for the benefit of pupils have been lost and there has been an impact on both staff and pupils at the school.

'I also take into account the impact the unproven allegations had on your health and which, it is said, led indirectly to you gambling large amounts of money.'
