Steve Jobs's tangled family of a forgotten father, long-lost sister and love child means lawyers may face a delicate task breaking up his $8.3billion fortune.

The 56-year-old co-founder and former CEO of Apple is widely seen as one of the world's greatest entrepreneurs - and he died just outside the top 100 world’s richest billionaires.

But behind the iconic Californian's wealth and fame lies an extraordinary story of a fragmented family.

Husband and wife: Steve Jobs leans his forehead against his wife after delivering the keynote address at an Apple conference in San Francisco, California, in June 2011, months before his death

Mr Jobs, of Palo Alto, California, is survived by his sisters Patti Jobs
 and Mona Simpson, his wife Laurene Powell Jobs and their three children
 Eve, Erin and Reed.

But his family is far from straightforward. He was adopted as a baby and, despite his biological father's attempts to contact him later on, remained estranged from his natural parents.

In his early twenties Mr Jobs became 
embroiled in a family scandal before his days of close media scrutiny, after he fathered a love child with his 
high school sweetheart Chrisann Brennan.

Ms Brennan, who was his first 
serious girlfriend, became pregnant in 1977 - and he at first denied he was the 
father.

She gave birth to Lisa Brennan-Jobs in 1978 - and in the same year Mr Jobs created the 'Lisa' computer, but insisted it only stood for 'Local Integrated Software Architecture'.

The mother initially raised their 
daughter on benefits. But he accepted his responsibilities two years later after a 
court-ordered blood test proved he was the father, despite his claims of being 'infertile'.

sister Mona Simpson, left, until he was aged 27. Lisa Brennan-Jobs,

Ms Brennan-Jobs has made a living for herself, after graduating from Harvard University, as a journalist and writer.

'My father was rich and renowned, and 
later, as I got to know him, went on vacations with him, and then lived 
with him for a few years, I saw another, more glamorous world'

She was eventually invited into her 
father's life as a teenager and told Vogue 
that she 'lived with him for a few years'.

'In
 California, my mother had raised me mostly alone,' Lisa wrote in an 
article for Vogue in 2008. 'We didn’t have many things, but she is warm 
and we were happy. We moved a lot. We rented.

 father was rich and renowned, and later, as I got to know him, went on 
vacations with him, and then lived with him for a few years, I saw

Biological dad: Abdulfattah Jandali, 80, a casino boss, has said he wanted to meet his son but was worried about calling him in case Mr Jobs thought he was after money

Mr Jobs was born to Joanne Schieble and Syrian student Abdulfattah Jandali before being given up for adoption.

Mr Jandali was a Syrian student and not married to Ms Simpson at the time of Mr Jobs's birth in San Francisco, California, in February 1955.

She did not want to bring up a child out of wedlock and went to San Francisco from their home in Wisconsin to have the baby.

Mr Jobs is thought never to have made contact with his biological father.

Mr Jandali, 80, a casino boss, has said he wanted to meet his son but was worried if Mr Jobs thought he was after money.

He had always hoped that his son would call him to make contact - and had emailed him a few times in an attempt to speak. Mr Jandali once said he 'cannot believe' his son created so many gadgets.

'This might sound strange, though, 
but I am not prepared, even if either of us was on our deathbeds, to 
pick up the phone to call him,' he said.

Ms Schieble and Mr Jandali then had a second child called Mona Simpson, who became a novelist.

Ms Simpson is an author who once 
wrote a book loosely based on her biological brother. She lives in Santa
 Monica, California, with her two children and was once married to 
producer Richard Appel.

Couple: Jobs and his wife Laurene Powell (pictured at the 82nd Annual Academy Awards in March 7, 2010) met in 1989. They have three children together - Eve, Erin and Reed

But
 Mr Jobs did not actually meet Ms Simpson until he was aged 27. He never
 wanted to explain how he tracked down his sister, but she described 
their relationship as 'close'.

Mr
 Jobs was adopted by working-class couple Clara and Paul Jobs, who have 
both since died, but they also later adopted a second child - Patti 
Jobs.

He later had the Ms Brennan-Jobs love 
child with his longtime girlfriend Ms Brennan in 1978.

He
 met his wife Laurene Powell in 1989 while speaking at Stanford's 
graduate business school and he had three children with her - Eve, Erin 
and Reed.

Residence: Jobs had lived in Palo Alto, California at this sprawling home, estimated to be worth $2.6 million

They married in 1991 and Reed was born soon after. He is their oldest child, aged 20.

Mr
 Jobs registered an incredible 338 U.S. patents or patent applications 
for technology and electronic accessories, reported the International 
Business Times.

He was believed to have driven a 2007 Mercedes Benz SL55 AMG, which was worth around $130,000 new at the time.

His 5,700 sq ft home was a 1930s Tudor-style property with seven bedrooms and four bathrooms - and it is estimated by CNBC to be worth $2.6million.

Mr Jobs also owned a huge historic 
Spanish colonial home in Woodside, which had 14 bedrooms and 13 
bathrooms, located across six acres of forested land.

But he later had it knocked down to make way for a smaller property after a long legal battle.

His charitable giving has always been a secret topic, just like most other elements of his lifestyle.

Mr Jobs reportedly declined to get involved with the Giving Pledge - founded by Warren Buffett and Bill Gates to get the wealthiest people to give away at least half of their wealth.

But he is rumoured to have given $150million to the Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of California in San Francisco, reported the New York Times.

It is cancer organisations that are most likely to be supported if any charities are in his will, as he died on Wednesday at the age of 56 from the pancreatic form of the illness.
