Anyone tuning in to the start of one of South Korea's most popular TV shows may believe they will get an evening of light entertainment with a group of women gossiping, having a laugh and flirting with their male guests.

Yes, it sounds like an episode of the UK's Loose Women or Oprah in the U.S.

But as Daisy Donovan discovered, 'Now On My Way To Meet You’ can cut from the trivia to traumatic in seconds. The women on the panel are North Korean 'defector beauties'. They have escaped the brutal dictatorship in the North and now star on the show - that airs on South Korean prime time TV -  to share their stories.

Fun: The South Korean show Now On My Way To Meet You kicks off with dancing and chit chat

Tears: But things can quickly turn solemn when they remember their lives in North Korea

With tensions between North and South 
Korea higher than they’ve been in decades, Daisy goes behind the scenes 
on the programme for the Channel 4 series The Greatest Shows on Earth, that airs at 10pm this evening.

She found that 'alongside the chat and fluff, the women also reveal shocking details of their lives in the isolated dictatorship, including torture, starvation and brainwashing - and every show ends with a defector telling their heartrending story, often looking for lost family members.'

One of the  'defector beauties' reveals how she was once tortured.

Loose Women with a twist: The women flirt with their male guests but also tackle serious issues

She said: 'When I was young I saw all the public executions. And if you escape, I was sent back to North Korea and the torture was just unbearable. It’s better to die than go through that again.'

Another described how as a child she was forced to take part in the 'mass games'. School children must practise for months on end to create a visual spectator where they move in unison, creating giant images by each holding up a certain colour card.

The children are slapped if they get a move wrong in training and are barely given time to eat or drink. Some even have to wet themselves because they are not given toilet breaks.

When Daisy asked the 'defector beauties' how the North views the West, they revealed how children there are taught to hate Americans from an early age. 

At school every year they have a 'Destroy the American scum day' - a sports day where events include races where children must be the fastest to a model of an American which they must beat with a stick.

Freedom: The 'defector beauties' have all escaped from hardship in the North

One of the women explained: 'In the North they believe America is the main reason why the North and South divided when war broke out. They believe if they just get the Americans out, Korea will automatically reunite as one.'

But Daisy's travels in the South revealed that the countries couldn't be more different.

While everything people in the North do is tightly controlled - including what they watch - in the South people have a vast array of entertainment choices with more than four million online TV channels available to them.

Daisy said: 'Seoul is the most wired city in the world, with the fastest internet connection on the planet and wifi on the underground. With high speed streaming available even underground, South Koreans can enjoy their favourite action fuelled dramas and spectacular pop concerts live and in HD whilst they’re on the move. But in the UK, the infrastructure needed for this kind of technology is years away.

'In this brave new world, if you’ve forgotten to pick up milk, Korean tube stations have the answer.  You can do your entire weekly shop at the virtual supermarkets that line the tube network.'

The Greatest Shows on Earth will be on Channel 4 this evening (Monday 8 July) at 10pm
