A youth has sparked fury after posting a video online of him kicking a kitten off his porch.

Walter Easley's clip shows him speaking to the camera before lining up the tiny ginger cat.

He takes off his shoes before kicking the animal over his three porch steps and about 10ft into his garden.

The video of Easley kicking the cat that was originally uploaded to Vine has sparked fury among internet users 

In the video the kitten appears to be unharmed and stands up immediately after landing on the grass.

The six-second video has received almost 500 comments on Reddit but after waves of anger and threats to Easley, it has now been taken down.

One user wrote: 'To kick a cat you have to be a messed up person but to post it to vine like it's funny, probably prompting other idiots to do the same thing, is unforgivable.

'This guy deserves whatever is coming to him', reported The Daily Dot.

Personal information about the man, who is believed to live in the U.S., has been posted on websites, as well as threats to attack him.

The clip also spread across Twitter, LiveLeak and YouTube where it has been viewed hundreds of times.

Since the video went viral, Easley has been subjected to threats and racist abuse online

The youth initially responded to the reaction on Twitter with the tweet: 'Lol now I got something to laugh at all day.'

Since the video went viral, Easley has been subjected to vile, racist abuse.

He has now changed his Twitter account to private.

A petition has also been set up called 'Bring Walter Easley, the kitten kicker, to justice'.

It has received almost 400 signatures since it was launched.

The video was initially uploaded on July 28 but only came to mass attention this week when it was posted on Reddit.
