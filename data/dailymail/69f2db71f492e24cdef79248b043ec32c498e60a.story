Plans for a tunnel to be built under Stonehenge to tackle bottlenecks have been resurrected and are being considered by traffic experts.

They are debating whether to build a dual carriageway alongside or dig an underpass beneath the ancient monument to alleviate traffic caused by visitors to the World Heritage site.

In 2007, ministers shelved the plans - after the cost of the controversial 1.3 mile bored tunnel scheme on Salisbury Plain, Wiltshire, soared from £223 million to £540 million.

Now the Government has reportedly commissioned a feasibility study examining how congestion can be eased in the area, the Telegraph reports - including the tunnel and dual carriageway.  

The final proposals will be outlined in the this year's Autumn Statement.

Also included will be the findings of five similar road-widening proposal schemes - including widening the A27 corridor, Trans-pennine routes, and the A47 between Peterborough and Yarmouth.

Two areas of the A1 around Newcastle will also be included in the study.

Last  month, Conservative MP for Salisbury, led calls for the tunnel plans to be resurrected.

He said any decision to make the A303 a dual carriageway must include protection for the site and added that a tunnel was the only 'realistic solution'.

During a Westminster debate, Mr Glen labeled the road 'one of the most notorious traffic blackspots in the country'.

Ralph Smyth, senior transport campaigner for the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE) said that traffic at the site had not increased in ten years and that it did not 'justify the huge cost of a tunnel'.

But he said that a tunnel would be preferable to a dual carriageway, as this could cause the site to lost its World Heritage status.

Last month the MoD was warned that it faces 'a global storm of protest' after it unveiled plans to build homes for soldiers near Stonehenge.

Outraged experts claim that the houses would block the world-famous solstice sunrise at the Wiltshire monument.

Army bosses want to build 4,000 homes for soldiers and their families returning from Germany on an old airfield overlooking the monument, but experts said the buildings would occupy the exact spot that the sun peeks over the horizon on the longest day of the year.

It’s an event that’s watched by some 20,000 people and leading archaeo-astronomer Simon Banton predicted there would be uproar if the plan goes ahead.
