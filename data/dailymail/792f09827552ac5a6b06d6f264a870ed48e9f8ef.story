Guilty: Sydney Youngs, 74, grew drugs to pay off a loan and his funeral, a court heard

A terminally ill pensioner  who farmed £115,000 of cannabis in a Breaking Bad inspired plot to save his family from  debt when he died has avoided jail.

Sydney Youngs, 74, was desperate to pay off a £10,000 bank loan hanging over him for more than a decade and wanted loved ones to have enough cash for his funeral, a court heard.

Youngs, who has chronic lung disease and a terminal heart condition, started cultivating skunk cannabis in a 'sophisticated' operation at his home in Bridlington, East Yorkshire.

Hull Crown Court heard the charity shop volunteer had recently attended the funeral of his nephew who was heavily in debt when he died.

An unnamed man approached him in a pub  suggested Youngs turned  his home into a cannabis farm to pay off his loan. 

But his crop  of the drug, worth £115,000 in total, was seized when police raided it on May 19.

His decision was similar to the one taken in drama series Breaking Bad where terminally-ill chemistry teacher Walter White turns into a drug baron to ensure his family's financial future.

Georgina Coade, defending, said: 'The state of his finances was very much concerning to him and then he attended the funeral of his nephew.

'That young man was in debt, heavily in debt, and the defendant saw the impact of that on his family.

'He saw the upset and distress it had caused to them, and it concerned him, him being in ill health, the level of debt he was leaving to his family.'

Youngs suffered his third heart attack on the day he was due to be sentenced for producing cannabis, the court heard.

Miss Coade said Youngs had been 'taken advantage of' and was remorseful.

But the court heard that although Youngs had led an unblemished life for the past 13 years, he did have a criminal record.

He was jailed for five years in 1962 for wounding with intent, and for four years in 1974 for non-dwelling burglaries and theft.

Given his background, Recorder Eric Elliott QC said the suggestion that the pensioner was naive was 'absolute nonsense'.

Youngs admitted cannabis production but escaped prison after the judge took pity on him.

He was given a two-year prison sentence, suspended for two years and will also be supervised for 12 months.

The judge said a prison sentence was called for, but he accepted that Youngs had done his 'level best to lead a decent life' in recent years, and because of his ill health, and other mitigating features, he was able to suspend the sentence.

He said: 'To suggest that you were naive, I think, is absolute nonsense.

'This was a sophisticated set-up and you were more than happy to go along with it.

'At the age of 74, it's very sad to see a man who had managed to turn his life around back in court facing a charge like this.'
