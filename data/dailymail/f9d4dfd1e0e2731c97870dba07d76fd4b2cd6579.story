England bowler Stuart Broad is to undergo surgery on his right knee on September 4, the England and Wales Cricket Board has announced.

The ECB revealed earlier this month that the 28-year-old paceman, who suffered a broken nose in England's innings and 54-run fourth Test victory over India, was to have surgery to address a long-standing patella tendonitis problem and a date has now been confirmed for the procedure.

Broad tweeted: 'I've seen the surgeon 2day (sic) and now def having surgery on my troublesome knee 4th Sep I've been due for a while so can't wait to get sorted.'

A statement issued by the ECB on Wednesday said: 'The ECB medical team confirmed that England pace bowler Stuart Broad is to have surgery on his right knee on Thursday 4 September.

'A rehabilitation and recovery programme will be determined following the operation.'

Broad has been troubled by the condition in his right knee for well over a year but has consistently put off going under the knife until now with a relatively quiet winter period coming up.

His rehabilitation time will be up to 14 weeks, but his participation in next year's World Cup is not currently in doubt.

The ECB had already confirmed that Broad would miss the five one-day internationals against India, which get under way at Bristol on Monday, as a result of the surgery.

'It's been confirmed I'm going to have an op,' the 74-Test veteran said after taking six for 25 against India on day one of the fourth Investec Test.

'The timing is not confirmed but the fella is flying over from Sweden after the Oval Test to have a look.

'It will either be after that Test or after the one-day series, depending on what he suggests.

Timing: Broad has been troubled by the condition in his right knee for well over a year but has put off surgery

'At any stage in the last 18 months I could have had the op and it's at the stage where it needs to be done.

'I should be fine (for the World Cup)...it's about three, three and a half months.'

He added: 'It's actually a really good opportunity for me to get the knee sorted and to use it as a strength and conditioning period.'
