Contestants will shimmy down the catwalk trying to impress the judges in day wear, swimwear and evening wear, but that's where the parallels end between the traditional Miss World and its alternative alter ego taking place at London's Globe Theatre next month.

The Alternative Miss World, which first took place in 1972, celebrates all things fabulous, flamboyant and unique. Perfectly toned bodies, spray tans and silky blow-dries are out. Think drag, glitz, glitter and avant-garde design.

The pageant is expected to attract 1,800 suitably-attired spectators to watch the glittering spectacle which will see 17 contestants vie for the 'crown jewels' trophy.

The show's founder and organiser, sculptor Andrew Logan, explains, 'It's all about 
transformation - but it goes way beyond drag. You can transform into anything. It's about letting your imagination really 
fly.'

He describes the event as 'the opposite' of the real Miss World. 'Creativity, equality and the unique are celebrated. We have no restriction on age, sex or gender and no rehearsals,' he says.

'I've always called it the surreal art event. When everyone comes together it's like a moving sculpture of people.'

The judging criteria may differ wildly from the real Miss World contest, but Logan says they are based on another famous beauty contest - Crufts Dog Show.

'It's all about poise, personality and originality,' says Logan. 'I went to Crufts in 1971 – and that's where I got the idea.'

This year, is the thirteenth pageant since its inception. The last one took place at The Roundhouse in London's Chalk Farm in 2009 and attracted 2,500 revelers.

Celebrated sculpture Grayson Perry is co-hosting this years pagaent. 'I’ve known Grayson since he was a young man. Now he’s the golden boy of the art world - and quite rightly so. It's great to celebrate with him.'

In the past the event has drawn celebrity fans including Ruby Wax, Julian Clary, and Zandra Rhodes, milliner Stephen Jones and Rula Lenska.

The theme this year is 'neon numbers'. 'Numbers is what we’re ruled by at the moment,' says Logan. 'And neon is the total antithesis to what you expect at The Globe, which will make it all the more interesting.'

'I like to think Shakespeare would have been very keen on this event though. He might even have entered himself.'
