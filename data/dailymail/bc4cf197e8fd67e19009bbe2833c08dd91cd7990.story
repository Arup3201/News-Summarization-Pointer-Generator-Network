'He fought so hard to stay with us': Cpl Jack Stanley, 26, from The Queen's Royal Hussars, has died at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham

A soldier has died from injuries suffered in an explosion in Afghanistan more than two months ago.

Corporal Jack Stanley, 26, who joined The Queen’s Royal Hussars in 2003, was on patrol on February 3 when he was hit by the blast from an improvised explosive device (IED).

He was brought back to the UK but died at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, surrounded by his family.

His commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Ian Mortimer, said: ‘Cpl Jack “Stan” Stanley epitomised the very best of his generation.

'We have lost a most outstanding soldier.’

He leaves his mother Brenda, his father Tom, three sisters and his girlfriend Sarah.

Cpl Stanley’s mother said: ‘He fought so hard to stay with us and the devastation we feel cannot be described.’

It means the number of British military deaths now stands at 408 since the conflict began in 2001.

The soldier, from Bolton, was a 
section commander who deployed to Afghanistan with C (Coriano) Company, 
Combined Force Lashkar Gah (The Queen’s Royal Hussars Battle Group) in 
October 2011.

Cpl
Stanley, who was described as 'a blond cheeky chap' devoted to Bolton 
Wanderers FC, leaves his mother Brenda, father Tom, sisters Rachel, 
Larissa, Joanne and his girlfriend Sarah.

Paying tribute, Cpl Stanley's mother said: 'Jack was a kind, generous lad with a ready smile.

'His dedication to his regiment was equalled only by his passion for Bolton Wanderers Football Club.

'He
fought so hard to stay with us and the devastation we feel cannot be 
described. The world is duller without him and heaven brighter.'

Lieutenant Colonel Ian Mortimer, commanding officer of Combined Force Lashkar Gah (The Queen's Royal Hussars Battle Group) said junior soldiers aspired to be like Cpl Stanley.

'Cpl Jack 'Stan' Stanley joined The Queen's Royal Hussars in December 2003. Right from the beginning he made a huge impression.

'Such was his ability and flair for soldiering he was quickly singled out to join the Regiment's Reconnaissance Troop where he excelled. He was utterly dedicated to his friends and the regiment, and this just shone through in everything he did.

'Hugely popular with all ranks, he was known for his quick wit and ready smile, even in the darker moments.

'Professional, fit, robust and utterly determined, he thrived on the challenges of army life, whether it was on operations in Iraq, or here in Afghanistan.

'He was fantastic at his job and also a renowned footballer. Both on and off the sports field he excelled. He epitomised the very best of his generation.

'We have lost a most outstanding soldier who was an inspiration to all. Junior soldiers aspired to be like Stan...Our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this most difficult and tragic time. We will remember him.'

Sergeant Jonathan David Hillary, 1 Platoon Sergeant, C Company, Combined Force Lashkar Gah (The Queen's Royal Hussars Battle Group) said Cpl Stanley would be missed by the whole platoon.

'Jack was a blond, cheeky chap from Bolton who would do anything to preserve as much of his hair as possible without getting caught!

'More importantly though he was a soldier to respect and follow. He was, and will be remembered as, a great leader to his young soldiers and respected by his commanders.

'I have had the privilege of commanding Jack for the past 18 months and it has been the best time in my 13 years of service. Jack will be missed by the whole platoon and there is now a hole in the hearts of all of the men who knew him. Our thoughts and prayers are now with his family and loved ones at this time. We will never forget.'

Cpl Stanley was treated in Afghanistan and the UK after he was wounded on February 3 in the bomb blast.

He died surrounded by his family, the Ministry of Defence said.

The soldier, who was on a patrol aimed at improving understanding of the area and the local population in Pupalzay Kalay, east of Lashkar Gah, was crossing into a field when he was caught in the blast.

He was taken by helicopter to a medical facility at Camp Bastion before being transferred to Birmingham where he died.
