Whale watching is big business, with people travelling from all corners of the globe and shelling out $2.1billion in 2008 alone for the chance to head out to sea and hopefully get just a brief peek at these majestic creatures in their natural habitat.

It would seem however that not all people are as excited by the chance to see a whale up close, as one man in Redondo Beach, California, was photographed by Eric J. Smith as he sat in a sailboat on a recent outing glued to his phone screen.

This as just a few feet a way a humpback whale rose to the surface right next to the boat.

A man in Redondo Beach, California was more interested in his phone than a humpback whale surfacing just feet away a few weeks ago

'A small private sailboat maneuvered really close to the whales, and this guy on it was literally sitting in that position and never moved,' Smith told ABC News. 

'He could have been texting his mom in the hospital for all I know, but I thought it sucked that he missed such a wonderful moment happening just two feet in front of him.'

It was not just the one photo either, as Smith, who is a professional photographer, says he managed to get five snaps, and the man did not once stop looking at his phone. 

The man has yet to be identified, and it is not known what whale watching company Smith booked for his trip, which got him these amazing shots.

Smith says the photo, which he posted Wednesday, was taken a few weeks ago. 

Humpbacks are one of the most impressive species of whale, migrating almost 20,000 miles a year and having been come back from the brink of extinction in the 1960s after their population declined by an astonishing 90% as they became a popular target for the whaling industry.

They have been a protected species since 1966.

The whale was just feet away from the man when the photo was taken in January, but all the man seemed to care about was his phone

The photographer, Eric J. Smith, took five photos and in all of them the man was staring at his phone and never once looked at the humpback
