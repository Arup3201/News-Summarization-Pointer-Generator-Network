Bad teacher: Jessica Streeper, 34, a former teacher from Pennsylvania, has pleaded guilty to a felony charge of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse with a male student 

A former middle school math teacher from Pennsylvania has pleaded guilty to having sex with one of her 14-year-old students last year.

Jessica Streeper, 34, a married mother of two from Doylestown, entered the plea Monday in Montgomery County Court to a felony charge of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse.

Judge Garrett Page postponed sentencing until the defendant undergoes a sex offender evaluation and the probation office completes a background report.

Streeper was a teacher at Eisenhower Science and Technology Leadership Academy in the Norristown Area School District.

Prosecutors said in a criminal complaint that an eighth-grade student told them he had sex with Streeper last spring in her car and in her home.

The disgraced educator could face a maximum sentence of 10 to 20 years in prison. She is currently out on $10,000 cash bail.

Prosecutor Sophia Polites said it would be 'appropriate' to sentence the former educator to prison time, reported the Bucks County Courier Times. 

‘Teachers are entrusted with the responsibility of teaching our children, making sure our children are safe,’ said Polites. ‘Teachers are role models. What this teacher did was destroy that trust.’ 

Wife and mother: The married mom of two admitted last year to having sex with a 14-year-old boy and sexting with him from her phone 

Jessica Streeper was arrested in May 2014 after police in Norristown received an anonymous tip informing them that the eighth-grade math teacher was having a tryst with a male student.

When the alleged victim, then age 14, was interviewed by detectives, he admitted to having sex with Jessica Streeper on seven occasions, including five times in her car.

When investigators checked the teenager's cellphone, they found numerous 'sexts' that were exchanged between the married teacher and her underage lover.

According to the criminal complaint, the illicit affairs lasted between April 1 and May 20, 2014.

During Monday's court hearing, Judge Page informed the defendant that as a registered sex offender, she will have to report her address and place of employment to state police for the rest of her life.
