A man who secured his first-ever date on Valentine's Day with a 'will date anyone sign' stood up the woman who accepted his offer after missing his train.

Paul Barry, 21, had managed to impress Jodi Thompson, 23, after he took to the streets of Southport, Merseyside, armed with his cardboard sign.

The pair had agreed to watch Fifty Shades Of Grey at the cinema, only for unemployed Mr Barry to miss his train from Southport to Liverpool - meaning he was 25 minutes late to meet her.

Instead, he spent Valentine's night in the pub with his pals while Miss Thompson watched the film with a friend.

'I just saw the train doors close then I realised that I was on the wrong platform,' said Mr Barry, who is originally from Dublin.

'It was a disaster.'

'She was really nice about it but I'm angry at myself really. It was all my fault and I'm pretty gutted.

'And it didn't help that I had to retell the story in the pub seven or eight times afterwards.'

Carrying his home-made sign and a bouquet of out-of-date tulips, unlucky-in-love Mr Barry hit Southport two weeks ago in a bid to meet a woman after he failed to get to grips with dating app Tinder.

However, Mr Barry who has never had a proper girlfriend before, failed to attract any ladies and it took a radio appeal to find his potential Miss Right, Miss Thompson.

'She thought I was going to stand her up so she had a friend on stand-by,' he said.

'I was quite gutted at the time but I'll keep trying and I'm sure I'll bounce back from this soon.

Despite Mr Barry's late arrival, the pair did meet up and Miss Thompson greeted him with a friendly hug

Mr Barry said he was 'gutted' to miss his date with Miss Thompson, and spent the night with his friends in the pub, meeting up with her after the film

'I think I'll just about be able to sit through the film when it's ready.'

Miss Thompson said she had forgiven Mr Barry for his lateness, but said a second date was not on the cards. 

'Obviously I understand these things happen, I have no hard feelings towards Paul,' she said.

'I actually got to meet him and he's a lovely person, so sweet and funny.

'I'm obviously disappointed the date didn't go ahead as I would of liked to see his reaction to the film.'

Although Liverpool-based Miss Thompson, an assistant manager for a foreign currency firm, said she has declined the offer of a second date, she described her would-be suitor as a 'gentleman'.

Jodi said: 'Unfortunately, at the moment I couldn't commit to another date but I was glad to be part of his experience.

'I would advise any girls out there who may be interested to get in touch as Paul was such a gentleman, he even brought me chocolates.'

Mr Barry's filmmaker friend Ryan Murphy, 21, from Southport, turned the desperate stunt into a film, titled Comedy = Tragedy + Paul Barry, for his media studies course at Southport College.

The trailer went viral after being shared online and the footage from the disastrous date will form the feature-length documentary, which will be released later in the year.
