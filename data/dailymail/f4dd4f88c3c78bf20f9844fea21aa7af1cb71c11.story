A female Texas state trooper who had been fired for conducting an illegal cavity search caught on dashcam video that went viral nearly two years ago pleaded guilty Friday to two counts of official oppression.

Kelly Helleson was sentenced to two years’ probation and ordered to pay a $2,000 fine stemming from a July 13, 2012, traffic stop in Irving involving Angel Dobbs and her niece.

Punishment: Kelly Helleson was sentenced to two years' probation and ordered to pay a $2,000 fne for conducting an unwarranted body cavity search in July 2012

The women sued the Department of Public Safety claiming that State Trooper Helleson inserted her hands inside their vaginas and anuses without changing the latex gloves.

The law enforcement agency eventually settled with the plaintiffs for $185,000.

In court Friday, Ms Helleson apologized for acting ‘injudiciously’ and causing pain with her actions, but denied touching anyone's private parts, the station NBC5 reported. 

‘At no time did I ever stick my finger inside any part of anyone's body - that never happened,’ Helleson stated in court.

She also added that Dobbs and her niece smelled of marijuana during the traffic stop, and she was merely doing what she was trained to do as a state trooper.

Angel Dobbs also took the stand during sentencing, telling the court that the cavity search has affected every aspect of her life and shaken her trust in police.

The woman recalled that when she first complained about Helleson's conduct to the DPS, she was allegedly threatened with criminal charges.

‘No woman should have their body unnecessarily violated in this type of way. This was a gross invasion of the victim's privacy and violation of the public's trust,’ said Dallas District Attorney Craig Watkins.

Helleson, a retired U.S. Marine, was fired last January after serving 10 years on the force, CBS DFW reported.

On Friday, the judge dismissed the more serious sexual assault charges Helleson had been facing. If she violates the terms of her probation, she will be sent to jail. Also, the former trooper has been barred from working in law enforcement.

The case made national headlines and led DPS to prohibit troopers from conducting cavity searches without warrants. 

Impact statement: Angel Dobbs told the court that the cavity search had shaken her faith in law enforcement

Friday marked the first time that a Texas Department of Public Safety trooper was convicted for conducting an illegal body cavity search.

The 'unconstitutional' search of Ms Dobbs and her niece, Ashley, took 
place in full view of passing cars on State Highway 161, near 
Irving, on the night of July 13, 2012.

Ashley and Angel Dobbs claimed Trooper Helleson used the same blue 
latex gloves while searching both of them.

The women were initially pulled over by Trooper David Farrell after he saw one of them throw a 
cigarette butt out the window.

Farrell can be heard in the 
disturbing video questioning the pair about marijuana after supposedly 
smelling the drug in the women's vehicle, though he failed 
to find any evidence of it in the car.

Despite that, he requested the women be searched by his female colleague because they were 'acting weird.'

'Unconstitutional': The search is being deemed unconstitutional in the lawsuit

The Dobbs' lawyer, Scott H. Palmer, said the shocking incident, which was filmed on one of the trooper's dash-mounted cameras, was a roadside 'sexual assault.'

He said the Texas Rangers investigated his clients' complaints but failed to take any action against the troopers.

The women said the 'molestation' has scarred them for life.

'I've never been so humiliated or so violated or felt so molested in my entire life,' Angel Dobbs told NBCDFW.com.

Her
 niece added: 'I don't think anybody needs to have to feel, or go 
through what we went through. It crosses my mind every day. It's 
humiliating.'

The trooper who called Helleson to do the search, David Farrell, was indicted on a theft charge for allegedly lifting a bottle of pills from one of the women's purse, but that count was later dropped.
