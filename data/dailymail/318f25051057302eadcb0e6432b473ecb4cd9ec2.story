Even as a brave paramedic neighbor tried desperately to stop his bleeding, Craig Sytsma knew he would die from the wounds he'd suffered during a vicious dog mauling on a rural Michigan road.

The 46-year-old father of three, who was bitten some eight times by two hundred-pound cane corsos while jogging in Metamora Township in July, was 'screaming' and begging' for help in his final minutes.

One neighbor, a medic, used a belt as a tourniquet to stop Sytsma's bleeding. She had to pause the rescue efforts momentarily while the massive dogs came back.

'I'm bleeding out,' a desperate Sytsma told his rescuer, according to the Detroit Free Press. 'I'm dying.'

Victim: Craig Sytsma, 46, was mauled by two massive cane corsos while jogging along a rural Michigan road

Valbona Lucaj and husband 
Sebastiano Quagliata, who owned the dogs, are being held on $500,000 bond each on second-degree murder charges.

A neighbor witnessed the vicious attack, and shot at the animals several times until he hit one and scared them off

He 'was losing a lot of blood and begged her to not let him die,' police wrote about the rescuer, Helen Barwig.

It took another neighbor, Barwig's boyfriend Edward Elmer, firing his .44-caliber Magnum at the dogs to end the attack. He struck one of the animals in the leg.

Sytsma only had time to tell Barwig that his name was Craig before losing consciousness. He was rushed to a local hospital but soon died of is injuries.

His dramatic final moments were revealed in response to a request by the Free Press under Michigan's Freedom of Information Act.

The police records show the two dogs had run loose for months in the small rural community, attacking at least two neighbors months before they killed Sytsma.

Some neighbors began to arm themselves, including the man whose shots eventually scared the cane corsos as Sytsma laid dying.

Sytsma, 46, was a dedicated father of three. He survived colon cancer and kept an active lifestyle to keep the disease at bay

The dog owners, Valbona Lucaj and husband Sebastiano Quagliata, were warned by their veterinarian that the dogs were dangerous but did nothing to control the animals and stop their frequent kennel escapes.

Lucas, 44, and Quagliat, 45, are both charged with second-degree murder in Sytsma's death.

The duo, who are both undocumented immigrants, remain locked up at Lapeer County Jail, each held in lieu of $500,000 bond. They are expected back in court on Friday.

The dogs were euthanized on Aug. 4, along with a third adult cane corso not involved in the attack. Eight puppies were to be offered to an animal rescue group.

The attack was the third since 2012 involving canines from Lucaj and Quagliata's property, officials said.

'Animal 
control should have done something,' said April Smith, who was bitten in May 2012 while walking her two dogs with her side.

'It should have never gone this far. 
The fact this has led to a death, it's sickening.'

Sytsma was a a divorced father of three who had beaten colon cancer the year before. He jogged as a way to keep the disease at bay, according to the Free Press.

He also played hockey and golfed, as well as regularly riding his mountain bike and playing beach volleyball.

But more than anything he was a family man who cherished his children Tyra, 16, Jordan, 23, and Luis, 28.

Son Jordan said that while his father fought cancer at the age of 23, he would rarely speak of it.

'I’d say, ‘I’m here for you, Pop,’ but I wouldn‘t ask questions,' Jordan Sytsma said.
