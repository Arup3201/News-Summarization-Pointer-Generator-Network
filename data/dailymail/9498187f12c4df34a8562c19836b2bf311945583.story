Amanda Knox has been given a lifeline after the judge who condemned her breached legal rules to give interviews about the verdict.

Defence lawyers said chief judge Alessandro Nencini’s comments show prejudice in his conviction of the American for the murder in Italy of British student Meredith Kercher.

It came as Knox, 26, was pictured looking pale and drawn as she walked with boyfriend James  Terrano in New York.

Guilty: Last week Knox was convicted of the 2007 murder of Meredith Kercher for a second time

But she has been given a lifeline after the judge who condemned her breached legal rules to give interviews

Last week the student nicknamed Foxy 
Knoxy was convicted of the 2007 murder for a second time when a court in
 Florence quashed a previous acquittal and sentenced her and 
ex-boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito to 28 and 25 years in prison.

Judges
 in Italy are banned from commenting publicly until after the final 
appeal to the Supreme Court, which in Knox’s case will not happen until 
next year.

But following 
the sentence Nencini gave an interview admitting the panel of 
professional and lay judges had become confused because they had watched
 TV reports and read news articles on the case.

In Italy most media implied that the defendants were guilty. 

The Amanda Knox defence has been given a final lifeline, after the judge who condemned her breached legal rules to give a series of revealing interviews about the verdict

Lawyers for the defence team have threatened legal action after comments by Chief judge Alessandro Nencini showed 'clear evidence of prejudice' in his conviction of Knox for the murder of British exchange student Meredith Kercher

Meredith Kercher was found with her throat cut in her bedroom in the central Italian city of Perugia

A Florence court upheld guilty verdicts for U.S. student Knox and her former Italian boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito on charges of murdering British student Meredith Kercher

He
 said: ‘The jurors returned home every day and were bombarded with 
information. When we met they would say, “Justice, but on TV they say 
that it happened in another way. What happened really?”.’

The
 judge seemed convinced of Knox’s guilt, saying he believed that the 
murder would never have happened without her. But he seemed less 
convinced of Sollecito’s culpability and said the Italian could have 
helped his case if he had submitted to cross-examination.

Defence
 lawyers have interpreted the comments as evidence that the panel was 
prejudiced, claiming the judges would have acquitted Sollecito if he had
 betrayed Knox.

Sollecito’s
 lawyer Luca Maori threatened legal action and added: ‘By saying that 
Raffaele should have taken the witness stand is he saying that if he had
 accused Amanda Knox he would have been acquitted?’

Rodolfo Sabelli, head of the  Italian National Association of Judges, said Nencini’s remarks were ‘inappropriate’.
