Jailed: Zack Thompson, 20, maintained his sleepwalking defence for two-and-a-half years before finally admitting he raped the girl at a Portuguese holiday resort in 2009

A rapist who claimed he was sleepwalking when he carried out a sex attack was finally jailed yesterday after admitting his defence was untrue.

Zack Thompson, 20, had maintained for two-and-a-half years that he had no recollection of raping a fellow holidaymaker in Portugal in 2009.

He finally changed his plea to guilty after psychologist Dr Mark Pressman, a U.S. expert in sleep-related disorders brought in to examine the evidence and interview Thompson, concluded his amnesia was down to the effects of excessive drinking and not sleepwalking.

It is thought to be the first time a sleepwalking defence has been successfully challenged in a sex case dealt with by UK courts.

In several cases, juries have cleared a defendant on the basis that he was sleepwalking (see panel below).

Jailing Thompson for six years yesterday, Judge John Milmo QC said his crime had a devastating effect on the victim, who was 17 at the time of the attack.

‘She said “I did nothing wrong”, and she was absolutely right,’ added the judge. ‘I only hope today will mark an occasion when she can go back to being the happy young girl she used to be.’

Nottingham Crown Court heard Thompson attacked the girl in the early hours of a September morning after they had been drinking in the Algarve town of Albufeira, where they were on holiday.

The victim, now 19, flew home the next day and reported the attack to her local police.

Thompson, 18 at the time, handed himself in to police at his local station in Newark, Nottinghamshire, when he returned to the UK. He claimed the pair had been drinking and were both ‘wobbly’ and he ‘couldn’t remember’ what had happened.

He did not deny committing the act, but refused to take criminal responsibility because he said he was sleepwalking and had no memory of what had happened.

Nottinghamshire Police, who agreed with their counterparts in Portugal that they would lead the investigation because both victim and suspect were back in the UK, spent months seeking expert advice about Thompson’s sleepwalking defence.

The National Policing Improvement Agency eventually put lead investigator DC Paula Winfield in touch with Dr Pressman at the Lankenau Institute for Medical Research in Pennsylvania.

Holiday from hell: Prosecutor Dawn Pritchard said Thompson raped the girl while they were both on holiday in Albufeira, Portugal on September 12, 2009

Guilty: Thompson finally pleaded guilty to the rape at a hearing at Nottingham Crown Court earlier this month after maintaining he had been sleepwalking and then 'insane' when he carried out the act

He found Thompson’s behaviour was not
consistent with that normally displayed by sleepwalkers, and concluded 
his memory loss was likely to have been the result of excessive alcohol 
consumption.

Thompson withdrew the sleepwalking defence, but then claimed he was insane at the time of the attack.

He finally pleaded guilty earlier this month after a psychiatrist rejected his claim of insanity.

He was placed on the sex offenders 
register for life. The court heard the victim, who was present to see 
him jailed, was on anti-depressants and had put her ambition to become a
midwife on hold.

After the hearing, she and her family
said in a statement that while they had often felt like dropping the 
case through frustration and exhaustion, ‘we knew there was no other 
option if we were to achieve justice and prevent the same thing from 
happening to someone else in the future’.

DC Winfield said: ‘We hope this 
conviction sends out the message that sleepwalking can no longer be a 
safe defence in cases of rape.’
