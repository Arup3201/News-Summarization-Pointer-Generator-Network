The oldest surviving film based on the works of Charles Dickens has been discovered.

The Death Of Poor Joe, inspired by Bleak House, dates back to March 1901 but lay unnoticed in an archive for decades.

The minute-long clip, made by British film pioneer G.A. Smith, was given to the British Film Institute in 1954 by a collector, but was catalogued under the wrong name and date.

The death of Poor Joe: Joe the sweeper collapses in the arms of a watchman in the film thought to have been inspired by Dickens' Bleak House

BFI curator Bryony Dixon found it last month – 200 years after Dickens’s birth and 111 years after the film was made, 31 years after Dickens died.

‘It’s wonderful to have discovered 
such a rare film so close to Dickens’s bicentennial,’ she said. ‘Not 
only does it survive, but it is the world’s earliest Dickensian film. It
looks beautiful and is in excellent condition.

'This really is the icing on the cake of our current celebration of Dickens on Screen.'

The film beats the previous record 
holder, Scrooge; or, Marley’s Ghost, by several months. It depicts the 
crossing-sweeper from Bleak House – played by Smith’s wife Laura Bayley –
being found by a nightwatchman as she freezes to death in the winter 
snow.

Landmark year: Across the world people are marking the bicentenary of Charles Dickens

The snow is falling heavily at night as Jo appears in tattered clothes against a churchyard wall, struggling against the cold.

A
watchman shoos him on, but then captures the boy just as he falls to 
the ground dying. The watchman holds Jo as the boy puts his hands 
together in prayer before taking his final breath.

In Bleak House, Jo did not die in the snow, but rather died of pneumonia 
and was led in prayer before his death by a character called Woodcourt.

However, the name 'poor Jo' would have been recognisable to English 
audiences as he was such a popular character among readers from the time of the 
novel's publication in 1853 and so it is thought likely the Dickensian 
character was the inspiration for the film.

Crossing sweepers were a common sight in London and other large cities throughout much of the nineteenth century.

Their
job was to sweep a path through the often dirty streets ahead of people
– particularly the more affluent – for a small fee.

Dickens describes Jo as a homeless boy who ‘fights it out at his crossing among the mud and wheels, the horses, whips, and umbrellas, and gets but a scanty sum’.

The film will be screened as a special late addition to the programme of Dickens: Pre-1914 Short Films this month at the BFI Southbank in London.
