She admitted her daughters were embarrassed by her dancing - but Michelle Obama is not letting that put her off.

After showing off her dance moves at sports events across the country for her campaign against childhood obesity, the First Lady has added yet another routine to her repertoire - the 'Platypus Walk'

Performing alongside a large, fluffy platypus named Perry, from Disney's Phineas and Ferb TV show, Mrs Obama flapped her 'wings', wiggled and shuffled from left to right.

The First Lady tried out 'the platypus' today during a visit to Disney World’s ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Orlando, Florida.

The event was to mark the second anniversary of her Let's Move campaign.

The publicity tour comes five years to the day that Senator Barack Obama announced he was running for president - and his wife's winning healthy eating drive can only serve to bolster his campaign for a second term in the White House.

She told reporters on Friday: 'I want him to be my president for another four years.'

Michelle Obama was joined yesterday 
by Disney actress Debby Ryan, choreographer Rosero McCoy, Perry the Platypus and professional athletes along with
local children and their families as she finished up the three-day tour
of Iowa, Texas, Arkansas and other parts of Florida.

She told the cheering crowd: 'You guys know I like to dance, I haven't completely gotten the dance down but I'm going to watch you all.'

The birthday tour of her Let's
Move! initiative kicked off in Des Moines, Iowa, where a raucous 
crowd of 14,000 joined the 48-year-old in dancing the Interlude.

Though a starring role in Glee may not be a likely option for the potential showbiz talent,
Mrs Obama's moves of late certainly give the impression that she is 
auditioning for a coveted part in the Fox hit musical show.

The University of Northern Iowa 
Interlude Dance routine has become a YouTube sensation, and the First 
Lady was more than happy to back her claim that she is 'pretty much 
willing to make a complete fool out of herself to get our kids 
moving', as she told a keynote audience last November.

Michelle Kwan, gymnast Shawn Johnson and WNBA player Tamika Catchings at
the Wells Fargo Arena, she waved her arms in the air, swung her hips 
and showed the screaming youngsters how the far-from-complicated dance 
is done.

Speaking to the packed house, Mrs Obama 
told children, celebrities and state officials: 'This is so cool!... 
Happy birthday, Let’s Move!'

Do the Interlude: The First Lady today once again proved she can shake her thing, leading an entire arena in a dance to celebrate the second anniversary of her campaign to lower childhood obesity in the U.S.

Throwing shapes: The First Lady seems to relish dancing in public - though we doubt a career in showbiz is on the cards. She last month told CBS that her daughters are embarrassed by her dancing

Her enthusiasm didn't end there. 'I’m proud that you guys are eating your fruits and vegetables, I’m proud that you guys are walking to school instead of taking the bus.'

Performances by the Isiserettes and American Idol contestant Katelyn Epperly kept the mood buoyant - even after a workout routine led by Mr Harper.

Iowa has set itself the impressive goal 
of becoming the healthiest state in the country by 2016 - with its 
Republican Governor, Terry Branstad, hammering the message home by 
proclaiming today 'Let's Move day' in the state known for its deep-fried
butter.

If successful, the state's 99 counties will move 16 places up Gallup's healthiest states league table in just four years, according to the New York Times.

Last month, Mrs Obama shook her stuff at Hayfield Secondary School in Fairfax County, Virginia as she promoted a cameo on the Nickelodeon TV show iCarly.

Far from the 'angry black woman' label 
she felt she had unfairly been given, Jennette McCurdy, who plays 
Samantha on the show praised the First Lady's moves, saying: 'I think 
she showed everybody up in the dance department'.

The recent drive to reinvigorate the campaign has seen the First Lady encouraging Jay Leno to eat more vegetables, flexing muscles with Ellen DeGeneres and even jumping in a potato sack race through the White House with Jimmy Fallon.

A recent survey by the Washington Post and the Kaiser Family Foundation has found that eight out of ten Americans have heard of the campaign, though the newspaper says it is still too early to tell whether the efforts are having a lasting effect on consumption and exercise habits across the country.
