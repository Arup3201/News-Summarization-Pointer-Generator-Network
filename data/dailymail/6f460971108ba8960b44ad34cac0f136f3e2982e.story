'What a nice coat, ma'am.'

That's all Texas fast food worker Cheryl Semien said to a customer who pulled up at her drive-thru cashier on Wednesday morning, but the words were enough to touch the woman sitting in her car.

So much so, she pulled the soft grey Mink coat straight off her back and passed it through the Whataburger window in Liberty - outside of Houston - to Semien.

'She was a perfect stranger, I didn't know this lady from nowhere,' the shocked employee told ABC 11.

'I didn't see her come through my drive-thru window as long as I've been at Whataburger for nine years.'

In shock: Cheryl Semien was at work at Whattaburger in Liberty, Texas on Wednesday - which happened to be her birthday - when a customer randomly handed over the mink coat off her back

Generous: The customer, known only as Nadine, said her instincts told her to give the precious jacket away

Stunning: The gorgeous real-fur coat is worth about $10,000, the owner said

Ecstatic: Semien's coworkers said she could not stop screaming after receiving the coat

Of all places: Semien has worked at a the Whattaburger in Liberty, Texas, for nine years

The woman, known only as Nadine, was eventually tracked down and reluctantly spoke to Eyewitness News on the condition her surname was not used.

She revealed the real fur coat is worth $10,000.

'She didn't ask for it, but she would have loved to have had one,' Nadine told the network.

'She was so sweet.'

But what compelled her to just give such a precious piece away? 

'I do fun things - it makes me happy,' Nadine said.

'Extending your hand in any manner makes people happy, and it will make you happy in the long run.' 

In a strange coincidence, it was actually Semien's birthday on Wednesday.

Grand gesture: Nadine said she likes to extend her hand to others because it makes her happy

Rugged up: Semien plans to wear the jacket with a nice pair of boots - not her work uniform

Scene: Liberty is about 40 miles northeast of Houston

Semien's co-workers said she was screaming 

'It was like she'd won a million dollars,' one worker said. 

'God watches you,' Semien said.

'God is watching every step you make.' 

She said she can't wait to wear the coat with a nice pair of boots.
