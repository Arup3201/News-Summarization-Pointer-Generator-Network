A photographer got a big surprise discovering this wacky insect with a huge grin pasted across its face.

The bug, a pitbull katydid, is native to Costa Rica and is a nocturnal, carnivorous insect known for its bizarre shocked look and flat head.

Exploratory entomologist Kenji Kishida, from Osaka, Japan, snapped the hilarious bug while visiting the Barbilla National Park in Siquirres, Costa Rica.

Novel: The bug, a pitbull katydid, is native to Costa Rica and is a nocturnal, carnivorous insect known for its bizarre shocked look and flat head

Mr Kishida, 41, couldn't believe his eyes when he first saw the insect which he said was shy at first poking its face out from behind a leaf before revealing the full colourful nature of its body.

Mr Kishida, who said the reddish tint on the katydid he was is quite unusual for the insect, said: 'The first thing I noticed was the bug's large head and flat face - he was rather shy and kept hiding.

'Katydids have the ability to bite extremely hard - they are ferocious hunters that will attack and kill just about any insect in their path so it would be very painful.

'Yet the thing I will remember the most is when its gaze met mine - the eye contact. It was very cute.'
