At times last week it seemed some were ready to award Chelsea the Premier League title on the back on a 3-1 win at Burnley.

And though in the end they did re-discover some of that momentum on Saturday, the over-riding lesson of their victory over Leicester was the stark reminder that Chelsea’s season will be a degree tougher in the long run and that they still struggle against well-organised teams.

True, they won comfortably enough in the end with goals from Diego Costa and Eden Hazard. And they could even afford a carnival moment towards the end, with Didier Drogba coming on, a hero returning to his natural home, on 79 minutes.

Yet though all ended happily, Chelsea laboured incredibly to get ahead in the first place. They were truly abject in the first half, languid and one paced, lacking both tempo and creativity, just as they had been for many games last season.

Mourinho disappeared down the tunnel a good three minutes before half time to prepare his team talk. Judging by his team’s response in the second half, their manager had let them know quite how bad it was, though somewhat bizarrely the coach seemed to think the weather - cool and breezy for the time of year - was partly to blame.

‘We have lots of work to do,’ said Mourinho afterwards. ‘Our first half showed clearly that we have to improve. This week I trained at 3 o’clock because I was expecting this, as it’s not the best weather to play football, because you get a bit lazy. But I was unsuccessful in that because the team was lazy in the first half, which I didn’t like. But in the second half everything improved and they showed that they wanted it.

‘I think the weather makes players lazy, lose a bit of tension and sharpness in the body and after that you pass slow you move slow and you don’t react to the second balls and by the time you wake up it’s half time

‘At half time we had to be a little bit emotional with them and make them realise we were at risk,’ said Mourinho. ‘I wasn’t annoyed but I told them that if you have the same feeling I have we’re not in trouble, we will change. But if you don’t we’re in trouble. I think they understood. It’s important not to lose points against teams that normally you would beat.’

It wasn’t simply that Leicester set up well and frustrated Chelsea. Dean Hammond was the most dominant presence in the midfield in the first half while Riyad Mahrez was always lively and indeed produced the first shot on target of the game on 35 minutes, which Thibaut Courtois got down well to save.

‘I’m proud but disappointed,’ said Leicester manager Nigel Pearson afterwards. ‘I’m disappointed we weren’t able to to convert an encouraging performance into a reward with points. The good thing is we created chances throughout the game. We played well but as always it will be about how efficient we are in both penalty areas.’

Where Fabregas had thrilled on Monday, in the opening 45 minutes he looked as ineffective as his midfield partner Nemanja Matic. Oscar offered little more. Costa felt the sharp end of his manager’s tongue at one stage and Hazard had reverted to type, leaving Cesar Azpilicueta to deal alone with the frequent incursions of Mahrez.

Half time did indeed prove pivotal. All of the above improved considerably and within minutes of the re-start Oscar had hit the post with a shot from outside the box and Kasper Schmeichel had pulled off an excellent save by pushing wide a Branislav Ivanovic header.

Yet Chelsea were also more open at the back and Courtois was called upon when Hammond played in David Nugent, who forced the Belgian into a fine save with his right leg on 52 minutes. And Nugent had an even better chance when put clean through by Mahrez on 55 minutes, Courtois again being forced to save with an out-stretched leg.

Schmeichel then got a decisive touch to a lovely Fabregas chip on 57 minutes but Costa finally made the breakthrough, when Oscar played a lovely through ball for Ivanovic on 63 minutes. The Chelsea right back managed to take out two defenders with a neat turn and cross for the Brazilian-born striker, who was making his home debut. His chest down looked heavy, but the ball fell kindly and he swept it in past Schmeichel from close range.

Having finally breached Leicester, Chelsea would never again look uncomfortable. And when Fabregas played in Hazard on 77 minutes, the Belgian simply cut inside his man and shot past Schmeichel for 2-0.

The game safe, there was time for that a sentimental moment with Drogba, after two years away, coming on to a hero’s welcome.

High in the stands, Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich beamed – a change from his usual default scowl – and wildly clapped his hands above his head in delight. Never have we seen the Russian quite so animated. Safe to say, his mood had changed somewhat from the opening 45 minutes.
