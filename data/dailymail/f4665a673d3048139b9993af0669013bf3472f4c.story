NBA star Eddy Curry's young son - the lone witness in the savage murder of his mother and baby sister - identified their killer by name before police arrived, his grandmother testified today.

Nova Henry, 24, and her 10-month-old daughter Ava were found dead in her Chicago apartment on January 24, 2009. They had been shot multiple times.

Noah Henry, 3, who was found hiding under a blanket on a couch in the living room, had witnessed the shooting, but was not injured.

Both Noah and Ava were fathered by Curry, 30, a former Chicago Bulls and New York Knicks star who used to date Ms Henry.

Testifying in court yesterday, Noah and Ava's grandmother, Yolan Henry, said that police had not yet arrived at the home when she asked the boy who 'hurt' his mother.

She said: 'He turned around and 
looked at me and said, "Frederick." He repeated, "Frederick did it." 
Then he put his finger to his lips and said, "Shhh,"' according to the Chicago Tribune.

Prosecutors say that 'Frederick' refers to the suspect, Frederick Goings, a Chicago attorney now on trial for the murder.

Goings had represented Henry in a 2006 paternity case involving Curry, and the two had later begun a romantic relationship, which Ms Henry tried to end before the murder.

Yolan Henry made the horrific discovery hours after the shooting while visiting Ms Henry's home with her boyfriend, Reginald Carter.

Carter testified yesterday that Noah was sound asleep, and both his hands and his feet were covered in dried blood.

Goings was arrested at a Comfort Inn in Indiana shortly after the bodies were found. In his car, police found a bullet that matched the gun used to kill Nova Henry and and Ava Curry-Henry, the Tribune reported.

He was also spotted swimming in the motel pool without a bathing suit on, and scrubbing at his fingernails, which prosecutors said is an indication he was trying to wash away evidence.

But Goings' legal team claims that there is no physical evidence that places their client at Ms Henry's home at the time of the murder.

Curry played a total of 11 NBA seasons with the Bulls, Knicks and Miami Heat.

After unsuccessful stints with the 
San Antonio Spurs and the Dallas Mavericks, he turned to the Chinese 
Basketball Association, and currently plays with the Zheijiang Golden 
Bulls.

The Tribune reported that Curry is on the witness list in the trial, but it's not yet known whether he'll testify.
