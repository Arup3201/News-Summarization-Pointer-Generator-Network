Tranmere Rovers midfielder Max Power is being watched by Rangers.

The 21-year-old has been one of the League Two side's best performers in recent seasons despite their slip towards the foot of the league.

His versatility and energy have impressed Scottish Championship contenders Rangers and they are weighing up a move in January with scouts believing he has the potential to improve. 

Rivals Celtic have also shown a tentative interest.

Rangers are currently second in the Scottish Championship and trail leaders Hearts by six points.

They could have done with Power's flair and creativity as they failed to overcome Alloa in their underwhelming 1-1 draw at Ibrox on Saturday.

Celtic, meanwhile, are first in the Scottish Premiership.
