Ed Miliband is facing mounting criticism from within his own top team for ‘wonkish’ policy announcements and a series of embarrassing gaffes.

On the day he attempted to woo business with a plan to hand control of £30billion in development funds to the English regions, there was fresh sniping over his leadership.

Labour peer Lord Glasman, a one-time policy guru for Mr Miliband, warned the party lacks ‘a sense of direction’ and urged his leader to ‘take a couple of novels rather than think-tank reports as his summer reading’.

Ed Miliband will today use another speech to declare that his ‘central mission’ is to ‘rebuild faith in business and politics’ 

A shadow minister said there had been too many ‘wonkish’ economic announcements that would not connect with real people – such as the devolution of business rates and plans for a new infrastructure commission.

‘Voters just expect governments to do this stuff [on the economy] – they’re not interested in all the wiring of how it works,’ he said.

Bemoaning a string of presentational blunders, the MP added: ‘We’ve got people being paid an awful lot of money to get these things right, and they’re not.’

Last weekend, it emerged Labour policy chief Jon Cruddas had been secretly recorded talking about bold ideas being stifled by the ‘dead hand’ of the leadership.

And in the Commons, David Cameron seized on Mr Miliband’s ‘misleading’ claim that the Government’s jobs boom has chiefly benefited London.

A briefing to journalists included the claim that four in five new jobs since 2010 have been created in the capital. This was repeated by Labour business spokesman Chuka Umunna and business policy architect Lord Adonis, who declared: ‘Four-fifths of net new jobs since 2010 have been in London.’

However, the statistic was taken from a report by the think-tank Centre for Cities using data from between 2010 and 2012.

The latest official figures from the Office for National Statistics show just a quarter of new jobs were created in London since 2010, and just a fifth over the past year.

Mr Miliband will today use another speech to declare that his ‘central mission’ is to ‘rebuild faith in business and politics’.

The Labour leader will also insist Britain must not ‘drift toward exit’ from the EU and ‘cut ourselves off from the rest of the world’. Earlier this week former London mayor Ken Livingstone said Mr Miliband hated ‘trivial’ concerns about his image and would be a great reforming prime minister.

His intervention follows that of former leader Lord Kinnock, and is the latest from a Left-wing veteran which may prove offputting to voters in Middle England.

Lord Glasman has attempted to backtrack, revealing he said sorry to Mr Miliband for his article in Tuesday’s Financial Times.

‘I’ve apologised for that,’ he said. ‘I did get it wrong. My point is we need a genuine story . . . and I think that’s happening.’

Last night, in another indication of tensions, veteran Left-winger Dennis Skinner was voted off Labour’s ruling national executive committee in favour of former minister John Healey, a loyalist.

MPs claimed there had been a campaign to oust Mr Skinner, who was said to have caused irritation by criticising the leadership.
