Irene McAuley, 18, one of 10 people injured in the Glasgow bin lorry crash, has left hospital 

An 18-year-old  injured in the bin lorry crash in Glasgow that killed six people - including three members of the same family - has been discharged from hospital. 

Irene McAuley, 18, was one of 10 people injured after the lorry mounted the pavement, ploughing into pedestrians and shoppers in George Square on December 22.

A 14-year-old girl and a woman aged 64 are in a stable condition at the city's Royal Infirmary. 

A 57-year-old man, understood to be the driver of the lorry, also remains in a stable condition at the Western Infirmary, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde confirmed.

Miss McAuley, a university student, suffered facial injuries following the crash. 

She was released on Monday evening after spending more than a week in hospital.

Her brother posted an image of the family beside Miss McAuley's hospital bed on Christmas day. 

He wrote: 'The events of George Square have brought our family together and we are lucky,' the Daily Record reported. 

More than 1,000 people gathered near Queen Street on Sunday to remember the victims of the crash. 

Primary school teacher Stephenie Tait, 29, and tax worker Jacqueline Morton, 51, both from Glasgow were killed in the crash. 

Gillian Ewing, 52, from Edinburgh, were killed when the council truck mounted the pavement before crashing into the side of the Millennium Hotel.

Erin McQuade, 18, and her grandparents, Jack Sweeney, 68, and his 69-year-old wife Lorraine, all from Dumbarton, also died in the accident. 

Miss McAuley's brother posted this picture of the family at his sister's hospital bedside over Christmas 

Dozens of flowers were left in tribute to the six people killed in the crash - just days before Christmas  

Jacqueline McQuade, mother to Erin, is believed to have gone to take out money from a cash machine during the Christmas shopping trip when her 18-year-old daughter and parents were struck by the out-of-control bin lorry.
