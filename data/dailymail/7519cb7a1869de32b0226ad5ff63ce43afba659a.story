In court: Disgraced Labour MP Denis MacShane arrives at the Old Bailey in London today

Disgraced former Labour minister Denis MacShane will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on Monday after admitting making bogus expense claims amounting to nearly £13,000.

The ex-MP pleaded guilty last month to false accounting by filing 19 fake receipts for 'research and translation' services.

He used the money to fund a series of trips to Europe, including one to judge a literary competition in Paris.

The maximum jail term available is seven years, but the former MP is likely to get less. MacShane was granted unconditional bail when he entered his plea.

Today in central London his sentencing was postponed until Monday at 10am.

The judge, Mr Justice Sweeney, said he wanted time to reflect before reaching a decision.

He allowed MacShane to spend the weekend on bail but said that was not an indication of his sentence.

The judge told MacShane: 'You have heard me make very clear that in doing that I am giving you no indication whatsoever what the sentence is going to be.'

Numerous former colleagues entered good character pleas for MacShane.

Labour deputy leader Harriett Harman paid tribute to MacShane's 'great depth of knowledge on Europe'.

She described him as 'well liked and admired by leaders in politics throughout Europe', adding: 'I have never known him to be duplicitous, financially greedy, or deceptive.'

Another character reference concluded: 'A cutter of corners, yes, a cavalier crusaders, yes, but a self-centred and greedy crook, certainly not.'

Mark Milliken-Smith QC, defending, said MacShane has 'suffered the shame, opprobrium, and loss of life's work and reputation'.

He told the court MacShane had suffered an 'extraordinary serious of devastating blows', including the death of his daughter and divorce from his wife, when he committed the offences.

He said MacShane admitted wrongdoing when first challenged over the expenses by Parliamentary authorities.

Mr Milliken-Smith also pointed out MacShane had not chosen to contest the decision to charge him, despite being assured in July 2012 that he would face no criminal proceedings.

Parliamentary authorities began looking at MacShane's claims in 2009 when the wider MPs expenses scandal engulfed Westminster. He was referred to Scotland Yard within months.

However, due to Parliamentary privilege, officers were unable to access damning evidence in which MacShane detailed how signatures on receipts from the European Policy Institute (EPI) had been faked.

It was not until after police dropped 
the case last year that the cross-party standards committee published 
the evidence in a report that recommended an unprecedented 12 month 
suspension from the House.

Police then reopened their probe in the 
light of the fresh information and he was charged in May.

MacShane was found to have submitted 19 claims for direct payments to the EPI between January 2005 and January 2008.

The invoices were signed by MacShane under the name of E.J.Matthews, the general manager of the company based at an address in New Kings Road, Fulham, southwest London.

MacShane's brother Edmund Matyjaszek was interviewed in 2011 and denied he created the invoices.

He
 stated that EPI was set up by MacShane to publish books and conferences
 but became dormant in 1994 and the office was used as a mail holding 
service.

The MP admitted in a prepared statement during interview in December 2011 that he set up EPI in 1992.

Prosecutor
 Peter Wright QC said in court today: 'He opened a bank account in EPI's
 name. He used the name Eric Matthews as a nom de plume so as not to 
associate him publicly with the publication of material.

'He said he thought his association with a pro-European think tank might hinder his career in the Labour party.

'Some
 of this work was requested by those in office for him to undertake and 
it is accepted he did have special expertise in European affairs.'

Some of the forged invoices used variations in his titles and in one case the spelling of his surname as 'McShane', the court heard today.

In the spotlight: MacShane stepped down from his post as MP for Rotherham last year following the scandal

Prosecutor Peter Wright QC said: 'He had taken the deliberate and dishonest step of providing not only false invoices but taking the time and effort in variance of his own name and honorifics.

'This was done simply to give the impression he was not the author of the document and to conceal the falsity of it.'

MacShane, who served as Europe minister under Tony Blair, resigned as MP for Rotherham last November before the punishment could be imposed.

He is understood to accept that he made a 'grotesque mistake', but argues there was no personal gain from the claims.

The Glasgow-born politician, who was elected as MP for Rotherham in 1994, is the sixth MP to face court proceedings over the expenses scandal that rocked Westminster.

Elliot Morley, David Chaytor, Jim Devine, and Eric Illsley were locked up in 2011 for fiddling their expenses - all four men have now been released from prison.

Margaret Moran, who fiddled £53,000 in the worst case of dishonesty in the scandal, was let off with a two-year supervision and treatment order last December after claims she was suffering from mental illness.

Between them they claimed around £127,000, of which former environment minister Morley admitted to claiming more than £30,000.

Two Tory peers, Lord John Taylor of Warwick and Lord Paul White of Hanningfield, were jailed for cheating the taxpayer of around £25,000.
