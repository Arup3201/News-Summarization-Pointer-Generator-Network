The Bronx teacher accused of raping a 10-year-old student sent an appalling apology email to the girl, claiming he was too rough during the attack — but said 'it’s normal,'

Prosecutors say Anthony Criscuolo, 40, allegedly sent the email to his fifth grade student at Public School 386 on Tuesday.

The day before, on Monday of this week, he is accused of raping the girl inside his car that was parked at a Soundview school.

The identity of the 10-year-old girl has not been released given her age and the nature of the crime

Charged: Anthony Criscuolo, 40, taught special education to fifth graders at P.S. 386 in the Bronx and now he faces rape and predatory sexual assault charges

Punishment pending: He faces rape and predatory sexual assault charges following the alleged incident on Monday

To be fired: Criscuolo has been employed by New York City public schools since 2002

'I was too rough. Sorry,' he wrote to the girl, according to court papers. 'It’s normal. You may feel pain for a few days.'

The brute was held on $750,000 bond and $500,000 cash bail after he was arraigned earlier today.

He faces a barrage of charged including rape, predatory sexual assault against a child and endangering the welfare of a child.

Criscuolo was arrested on Wednesday, 
after the parents of his victim found a number of sexually explicit 
emails that had been sent by the twisted teacher.

Scene: Criscuolo's Dodge Charger was wrapped in police tape on Wednesday after police arrested him for raping a 10-year-old girl inside the vehicle on Monday

Deceptive: Criscuolo allegedly sent a letter to the girl's parents on school letterhead asking for permission to drive the girl to a fictitious awards ceremony

Criscuolo had told the young 
girl's parents that she was being given an academic award and so they 
gave him permission to drive her to the fictitious ceremony.

He had even faked a letter in to the 
girls parents in which he claimed their daughter had written an 
award-winning persuasive essay, sources said.

When the teacher picked the girl up in his car, he took her directly to a Queens parking lot and raped her in the car.

Tinted windows meant that ever passers-by would not have been able to see the attack taking place.

'If these facts are proven to be correct, it’s really a totally outrageous situation,' said NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly.

Criscuolo has worked as a teacher in New York City public schools since 2002 and Investigators are trying to determine if there are any other victims.
