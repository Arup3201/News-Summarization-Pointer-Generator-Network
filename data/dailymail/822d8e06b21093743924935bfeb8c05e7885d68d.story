Brains and beauty is quite the enviable package, and now one 24-year-old student has proven she has both in droves.

Last night, Carina Tyrrell, who is in her fifth year of medicine at Murray Edwards College, Cambridge, beat 60 other contestants to take the title of Miss England.

Next, the 24-year-old Miss Cambridgeshire, who only finished her university exams last week, will compete in Miss World.

Carina, who hopes to become a global health doctor at Addenbrooke’s Hospital when she graduates, took part in a four-day final, which culminated in a catwalk show in Torquay in Devon last night.

'I’m thrilled to have won,' said Carina, from Cambridge, who won the beach beauty round of the contest two weeks ago by modelling beachwear. She has also competed in interview rounds, sports rounds and eco rounds.

The doctor-to-be says most of her peers were very supportive, but admits, 'a few were a bit perplexed'.

Carina still has one more year to go at Cambridge and is determined not to let her studies slip

Defending her decision to take part she told The Telegraph newspaper, 'You’re never going to get away from the
 fact that people are attracted to beautiful things. I think that can be
 used to the advantage of other things such as charity. Let’s use beauty
 and do something with it.'

'It’s saying to women, be charitable, 
think of others, be healthy and sporty, if you’re talented at something,
 great, and if you want to represent your country, take on a leadership 
role, do it,' she added.

Carina said that despite the surprise of a few peers she has had a lot of support from fellow pupils and her boyfriend.

'Most of my fellow doctors are really supportive and my boyfriend is really excited.'

Carina is president of the Global Health Society at the university, which has just started a project to help the homeless in Cambridge

Carina has one more year left at Cambridge University and currently juggles lectures with shifts at Addenbrooke’s Hospital in the city.

She is also president of the Global Health Society at the university, which has just started a project to help the homeless in Cambridge.

'It is going to be such an honour 
representing my beautiful country. Miss England is all about inner 
beauty as well as outer beauty and I want to be a role model to the 
youth, and with my medical background I want to bring awareness and aid 
to people suffering in the world,' she says.

All-rounder: Carina says that being Miss England is a case of inner beauty as well as outer beauty and she has used her modelling talents to help raise money at charity catwalks

Carina, who is the only member of her family to go into medicine, has always been interested in fashion too and took part in a charity catwalk show when she was at school.

'When I was younger I made a range of dresses and then modelled them at a catwalk show to raise money for charity,' she says.

'In my first three years at university I had to hold back on the modelling as I had so much studying to do, but last year I did some photo shoots and I also won the under 21 category in the Cambridge Model Search competition.'

Carina, 
whose mum was a secretary and dad was a physicist before they retired, 
said the Miss England competition was something she always wanted to do.

Carina
 adds, 'Cambridge means so much to me I really want to give something 
back. Hopefully winning Miss England will mean I'm able to do that.

'My desire to help those in need is very 
strong and this is reflected in my training to become a doctor.

'As student doctor, you meet new people 
every day and you are constantly in the public eye. Being comfortable in
 this setting I believe helps in a beauty contest.'

'Being a Miss is not just about physical attributes, you have to be beautiful on the inside and have a caring heart too and be well-rounded. Miss England is a beautiful ambassador for the country.

'I am very caring and always try to help people as much as I can. I think winning the competition will enable me to help people in a new way.'

Angie Beasley, director of Miss England, said the fact Miss England is attracting girls of Carina's caliber shows the pageant is not all about just having a pretty face.

She said: 'I'm delighted to say the Miss England competition is attracting a new breed of girls from all walks of life. Our
 message is Beauty with a Purpose - the ethos of Miss World.'
