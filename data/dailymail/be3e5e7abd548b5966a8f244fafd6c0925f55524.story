Stuart Lancaster will watch on anxiously this week as England’s stars enter an eight-week passage of the season which players’ union chiefs argue will be more physically and emotionally demanding than the World Cup itself.

Tom Croft’s latest bout of knee surgery is the more recent blow and, with the European Champions Cup (EPC) kicking off on Friday, when Harlequins face Castres, and with Saracens, Sale, Northampton, Leicester and Wasps all in action on back-to-back weekends ahead of a four-Test international series against the All Blacks and co, Lancaster faces an anxious fortnight.

Leicester and England flanker Croft, 28, had surgery on Thursday to remove a screw in his knee and is the ninth potential member of Lancaster’s Elite Player Squad for the November QBE internationals to be ruled out through injury.

With a further two EPC matches following clashes with New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia, there is growing concern demands on members of England’s Elite Player Squad — to be announced on October 22 — are too great. ‘The way the game is evolving, it is only getting more physical and more intense, more competitive, more running, more everything,’ said England and Northampton prop Alex Corbisiero, before he suffered a shoulder injury that meant another lengthy spell on the sidelines.

‘The number of games we play is definitely something that could be looked at, especially those guys who you want to go and play however many internationals a year.

‘You have to be careful what you say as well as a player. You sign the deals in the Premiership to play the amount of games you play. But going forward, bigger picture, long term, there is definitely room to at least look at that topic.’

RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie is expected to meet with his Premier Rugby counterpart, Mark McCafferty, in the coming days to start negotiations over the next heads-of-agreement between clubs and country, with the current deal concluding in 2016.

The Rugby Players’ Association, the body charged with representing the player’s interests, will not play a direct part but chief executive Damian Hopley has been given assurances that player’s concerns will be heeded.

‘It’s a treadmill that we put players on, especially at the top end,’ said Hopley. ‘The players who are the best in their field at club and international level are expected to deliver week in, week out. Having said that, the support these players get now has never been better and clubs would be mad to burn out key people. Do I think there is a crisis? No. Overall we are in a healthy place as a sport. But as a union we believe four weeks should be a minimum rest period for all players between seasons.

‘We’re all excited about the new European fixtures and what they will deliver. But you need to look at having two European games followed by four autumn internationals — three against the best teams in the world — then two at the other end of it. It’s probably more demanding than a World Cup in terms of pressure put on players.’

With multi-million TV revenues central to the sport’s survival, it is almost impossible to see a future where less rugby is played. But there are clearly consequences as a result of the ‘bigger, stronger, faster’ culture. An investigation by The Mail on Sunday last season, in conjunction with the RPA, found that 28 professional players retired through injury during the season; an increase of almost 80 per cent over five years.

It is unclear if that figure will be reduced this year but early signs are not promising. Former England internationals James Simpson-Daniel (ankle) and Andrew Sheridan (shoulder) have been forced to retire prematurely this season through injury.

Wales international Jamie Roberts has said that he expects to suffer from arthritis by the time he reaches 40

Last week, Wales international Jamie Roberts admitted he is ‘ready for arthritis when I’m 40’ as a result of the collisions he has experienced playing rugby. The WRU recently signed a deal with the Welsh regions which will see dual-contracted players limited to only 16 non-international matches a season. Many believe a similar deal should be struck in England.

‘We simply have no idea what sort of physical condition these players are going to be in in 10, 15, 20 years’ time,’ said Dr Barry O’Driscoll, who retired from the International Rugby Board’s medical advisory panel in 2011 in protest at the way rugby treated concussion.

‘We are seeing significant health issues with my generation [from the Seventies] of players which are clearly linked to playing rugby but we were not playing the same game the boys are playing today. You simply cannot compare the ferocious level of physicality we see week-in-week-out in the professional game.’

Harlequins boss Conor O’Shea, who received heavy criticism last season for giving his England players one week off following the Six Nations, but its widely viewed as one of the most progressive directors of rugby, said: ‘The game is more physical than I can ever remember. The issue of rest periods needs to be addressed.’
