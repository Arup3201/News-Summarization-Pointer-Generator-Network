Transgender newscaster Zoey Tur has revealed her NBC foreign correspondent daughter Katy stopped speaking to her for a period after she decided to transition.

Tur, formerly known as Chopper Bob, became famous for filming a mob beating driver Reginald Denny during the LA Riots, and the O.J. Simpson car chase. 

'My son was great, he told me, 'I support your decision and if this will make you happy then I'm on board,'' Tur told People.

'But my daughter was shocked. She had a great deal of difficulty and we stopped talking for a long time.'

Following 14 months of hormone treatment Tur  underwent successful sexual reassignment surgery in June 2014, transitioning from male to female.  

On Tuesday night Tur appeared on Inside Edition and said her daughter who lives in London was encouraging about her new role.   

'My daughter found out about it and sent me a nice note saying congrats on the job and told me that I look beautiful, which meant a lot,' she said.

'She saw her father a certain way, a hero pilot' Tur said. 

'Bob Tur was legendary, and she liked that.

'She has trouble with that, and she should. She has to meet me and find out who I am.' 

The 54-year-old from Santa Monica decided to begin the change in 2013 and said that once the process was complete 'Bob must die' to make way for Zoey.

'My son (left) was great, he told me, 'I support your decision and if this will make you happy then I'm on board,'' Tur (right) told People in an interview 

She said she was 'done hiding', after starting to push family and friends away and had suffered from body dysmorphic disorder.

Family and friends were supportive of Tur's decision, although she said that for some it felt like grieving as they prepared to say goodbye to Bob.

'For the most part, people didn't know. They were in a state of shock initially,' she told CBS Los Angeles.

Tur, who married fellow reporter Marika Gerrard at age 23 and has dated Carrie Fisher, has more than 10,000 flying hours over war zones and riots.

She said in 2013 the hormone therapy had already affected the way she flew, adding that her thought pattern had become more analytical than instinctive.

She said that she planned to have surgery to make her face more feminine and to have sexual reassignment surgery.

In an interview with TMZ she said: 'Transgender people really are misunderstood. It's not what you think'.

The pilot says she has had a female brain since birth, but struggled to come to terms with who she is.  

'It's a genetic disorder that happens in utero. Nobody knows exactly why, but you're born with a female or feminized brain,' she said.

'If you don't really know who you are. You think you're a woman, but you're a man.' 

Tur helped capture images of truck driver Reginald Denny being beaten during the LA riots

The pilot was also there to get footage of OJ Simpson's car chase in June 1994
