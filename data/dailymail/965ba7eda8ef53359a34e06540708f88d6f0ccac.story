A Victoria Cross medal awarded to a soldier who volunteered for a suicide mission during the First World War is to be auctioned for £160,000.

The honour, the highest decoration for valour in the face of the enemy, was awarded to Private James Towers after he bravely volunteered for the mission at Mericourt near Lens, France, on October 6, 1918.

The soldier, from Preston, Lancashire, stepped forward as the sixth man to dash out in front of enemy machine gun posts and get a vital message to a cut-off platoon 150 yards in front of him.

He put himself forward despite witnessing the five previous runners - including his best friend Private Frank Dunlop - get shot down just minutes earlier.

During his mission, he managed to evade bullets and even startled a German machine gun nest when he leapt across an embankment and landed just five feet away from them. They were so surprised they failed to launch bullets until after he had fled.

The solder eventually made it to the lost platoon, gave the orders to the commanding officer and dug in with them for the night.

Using his knowledge of the location of the German machine gun posts, he led them safely back to the British lines at dawn the next day.

For his incredible act of courage, he was awarded the Victoria Cross and it was presented to him by King George V at Buckingham Palace upon his return to Britain.

It was left to his family when he died, aged 79, in 1977, and later sold at auction in 1983.

It has been owned by a private collector for the last 30 years but is now going to be sold on again at an auction in London later this month.

As well as the Victoria Cross, four other medals of his will also be auctioned including his British War and Victory medals, his Coronation 1937 medal and his Coronation 1953 honour. 

The collection has been given an estimated guide price of between £130,000 and £160,000. 

David Erskine-Hill, of auctioneers Dix Noonan Webb, said: 'James Towers had watched five comrades die as they tried to get through to the lost platoon yet he still volunteered to take the message.

'This was cool, calculated courage from a man prepared to risk his own life to stop his fellow soldiers from being cut off. Through a combination of athletic prowess and sheer good luck he got away with it.

'His is a great story of gallantry and survival.'

Tory peer Lord Ashcroft currently owns the world's largest collection of Victoria Cross medals and is likely to bid on the one awarded to Private Towers.

Private Towers tried to join the army as an underage 17-year-old but enlisted again after he turned 18.

He joined the Cameronians (Scottish Rifles) and went to the Western Front in December 1916 before being sent to Mericourt near Lens.

In an interview in a local Lancashire newspaper given years later, Private Towers said: 'I joined up as a youngster for a bit of fun, but it didn't turn out like that. We were young men made old before our time.'

Regarding the brave act for which he was awarded the Victoria Cross, he said he had to try and get a message to a group of 30 comrades that the battalion was ready to withdraw from the ruined village of Mericourt.

He put himself forward after a volunteer was requested to go into No Man's Land and lead the men back.

Private Towers, who had daughter Marion with his wife Ethel, said: 'I had to go to the help of these lads, after all, they were my pals.

'Five men tried to get through and I was the sixth. I made a dive and got through. The worst part was that I didn't know where our chaps were. In a run for about 150 yards I went within five yards of one of Jerry's machine-guns. It was my lucky day.'

The recommendation for his Victoria Cross states: 'In spite of heavy fire opened on him as soon as he moved, he went straight through from cover to cover and eventually delivered the message. His valour, determination and utter disregard of danger were an inspiring example to all.'

After the war, Private Towers returned to work at his parents' farm and went on to run a milk distribution business in Lancashire.

He attended a number of Royal dinners held in honour of Victoria Cross winners.

After one such event at the House of Lords in 1929, he reached his local railway station at 5am the following morning, walked three miles home and went out on his milk round at 7.30am.

Private Towers' medal collection will auctioned by Dix Noonan Webb on March 25.

Cambrai, north France, during the First World War

Private James Towers was part of the 2nd Cameronian (Scottish Rifles).

The group were occupying the ruined village of Mericourt, near Lens, France, in October 1918 when the battalion was ordered to withdraw troops.

Mericourt was situated to the east of the Beaurevoir Line and troops were dispatched in early October to capture the  Line - the third line of defences of the Hindenburg Line - and the surrounding areas.

The Beaurevoir Line was the last of a series of German defensive lines and consisted of thick barbed wire entanglements and well-sited machine and anti-tank gun bunkers.

The original attack on the Hindenburg Line launched on September 29, 1918, had planned to encompass the Beaurevior Line as well, but was not successful.

British and Australian troops were ordered to break through the Beaurevoir Line on October 3, 1918.

However, on October 6, 1918, orders were issued for the village of Mericourt to be evacuated. The message failed to reach a party of 30 British soldiers, who were surrounded by German machine gun posts.

It was at this point a volunteer was requested to dodge firefight to take the message directly to the B battalion.

Private James Towers was successful and the group was led back to the British lines.

Two days later, British and Canadian troops broke through the Hindenburg Line at the Second Battle of Cambrai. The collapse forced the German High Command to accept that the war had to be ended.
