Stuart Lancaster wore a broad grin on Saturday night but when England’s coach reflects in the mirror on Sunday morning, he will know his side have much work to do to mount a credible World Cup challenge.

England deservedly stopped the rot against the southern hemisphere’s big three with a forward-dominated victory over a disjointed and horribly underpowered Wallaby side who somehow stayed in the game through a combination of sheer will and high-quality back play.

No 8 Ben Morgan and lock Courtney Lawes produced towering displays as England’s pack - who have performed admirably all autumn - crushed Australia’s scrum with ridiculous ease. But it was no thing of beauty.

Four years ago in Perth, Martin Johnson’s England produced a similarly muscular scrummaging performance but somehow lost.

Mercifully, in no small part thanks to Morgan’s ballast and Lawes’ astonishing work-rate for the 50 minutes he was on the field, England did not make the same mistake on Saturday and instead repeated last autumn’s Twickenham victory over the same opponents.

But let’s not kid ourselves. While Morgan scored two tries - one of them a pushover from yet another commanding scrum - and Lawes was imperious all over the field, England’s three-quarters rarely threatened. Despite an extraordinary level of set-piece dominance, England hardly created anything of note beyond fly-half George Ford.

Lancaster rightly pointed out on Saturday night that with a scrum so dominant there was no need for his side to go wide.

But throughout the autumn England have had parity or better up front but failed to utilise their quick men out wide. The gap in skill and spatial awareness between their three-quarters and the southern hemisphere’s finest remains seismic.

‘Sometimes if your set-piece is dominant you don’t get width on the ball because you get penalties and you kick them or you get a try,’ England’s head coach said. ‘We could have moved the ball from the scrum straight away and maybe scored a try with our wingers but why would you do that?

‘The most pleasing thing overall, if you look back at 2014, irrespective of today’s result, we scored 26 tries and 21 were by the backs.’

Lancaster has every right to accentuate the positives, and there have undoubtedly been some this autumn, but overall it is hard to see how his side have progressed.

Robbed of seven Lions and the hugely influential Joe Launchbury, Lancaster entered the series with one hand effectively tied behind his back. But the lack of opportunities created and the failure to take those opportunities when they did present themselves, must be a concern.

on Saturday the latest midfield combination of Billy Twelvetrees and Brad Barritt again lacked incisiveness, while some of scrum-half Ben Youngs’ decision-making at the breakdown was ponderous.

It was perhaps telling when asked what single thing he would add to his squad ahead of his side’s next match against Wales at the Millennium Stadium on February 7 Lancaster simply replied: ‘Manu’, in reference to the hulking Leicester centre who has missed this series with a groin injury.

‘We’ve got seven Lions to come back into the team as well as Joe Launchbury who is a quality player for us,’ Lancaster said.

‘We have not got everything right by any stretch of the imagination, there’s still a lot of work to do.’

It looks increasingly likely Ford will be the man to pull the midfield strings going in to the Six Nations following another extremely composed performance from the 21-year-old Bath fly-half on only his second start.

Ford was largely responsible for England’s much-improved kicking game and, while he will hope to add more layers to their attacking game, he can be satisfied with another fine contribution.

‘I thought George was excellent,’ Lancaster added. ‘His emergence in the team has been a real bonus.’

The highlight of England’s performance was undoubtedly Morgan’s first-half try when another thunderous scrum led to Barritt punching up in the midfield before Tom Wood - who enjoyed his best game of the autumn - fed Morgan on his left shoulder for the Gloucester eight to crash over.

It was sharp, incisive and effective and a reminder of the way England played for much of last season’s Six Nations, with forwards running flat to the line and off-loading to another runner.

The home side took a 13-3 lead into half-time but when Bernard Foley scored a superbly worked try - combining brilliantly with Rob Horne - shortly after the break the Wallabies were somehow back in the game.

Morgan’s second came courtesy of a clever kick from Mike Brown - and an equally good chase from Jonny May - which forced Australia replacement Quade Cooper to carry the ball over his line and concede a five-metre scrum.The resulting pushover try was as certain as death and taxes.

Another Wallaby replacement, Will Skelton bulldozed over to bring the score back to 20-17 with 20 minutes to go but with England’s pack maintaining their vice-like grip, the home side pulled clear with Ford adding two late penalties, taking his tally to 16 points.

Lancaster and his coaches embraced at the final whistle. They have worked incredibly hard but received only limited rewards this autumn.

They deserved their moment of victory on Satuday. But they know their autumn school report will read: must do better.
