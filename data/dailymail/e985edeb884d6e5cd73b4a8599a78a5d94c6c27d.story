Like a scene from hell, flames engulfed Kiev this week as thousands of masked protesters hurled rocks and Molotov cocktails at heavily armed riot police surging forward behind huge metal shields.

Their massed ranks responded with tear gas, stun grenades — one of which was reported to have blown off a marcher’s hand — and, fatally, shotguns.

Two protesters fell dead after being hit by bullets, one of having been hit in the head, neck and chest.

It was the most violent exchange yet, following weeks of clashes during which hundreds of thousands of protesters have thronged the streets of Ukraine’s capital, yearning to overthrow their authoritarian, pro-Moscow government.

Now, as heavy snow blankets the city, they continue to defend their barricades, claiming they are ready to fight ‘to the end’.

Opposition leaders have issued an ultimatum to the president, Viktor Yanukovych, to call early elections in the coming days and scrap new anti-protest laws, or face further violence.

The most iconic figure to emerge as a rallying point for the uprising is the world heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko, his hulking 6ft 7in frame a steely symbol of defiance at the heart of the demonstrations.

Yet he has not been reckless in his rhetoric. Last night, the pugilist-turned-politician — whose fans call him Dr Ironfist because he has a doctorate in sports science — was reported to have urged protesters to observe an eight-hour truce ahead of talks with President Yanukovych.

‘I will return to you and inform you of the result of the talks,’ he was quoted as telling protesters. ‘Keep the barricades in place, but be calm until the talks finish.’

Only a few weeks ago, his followers — who long to see true democracy flourish in this troubled nation — seemed to be winning this brutal battle of wills.

They managed to topple a giant statue of Lenin — hated symbol of the repressive Soviet regime — hammering it to pieces in scenes of rage and defiance that revealed the strength of pro-Western feeling among many Ukrainians.

But now, as we saw this week, the regime is determined to crush them.

This is not merely a matter of internal Ukrainian politics. The battle for Kiev also symbolises Russia’s latest — and most audacious — bid to regain a hold over its former empire.

Vladimir Putin, the ex-KGB hard man in the Kremlin, has muzzled his own country’s media, cowed its courts and turned its political institutions into shells.

And now he wants more. The countries of the former empire must do things Russia’s way, too.

The Ukrainian regime, bailed out by the Kremlin last year with cheap gas and loans, has now passed a bundle of repressive laws to cripple protest and opposition — just as in Putin’s Russia.

But Ukrainians do not want to live in the Kremlin’s shadow. Desperate to escape their Soviet past, they yearn for the same legal rights, prosperity and freedom we enjoy in Europe.

Sadly, they have been let down by their corrupt and incompetent rulers, who, acting as Putin’s puppets, refused last autumn to sign a trade agreement with the EU.

The EU had been negotiating for closer links with Ukraine and five other ex-Soviet states for a year. But the deal fell apart at a summit in October. Instead, the thuggish Ukrainian leader turned to Russia.

One great danger now is that the crackdown succeeds in Ukraine, and that its military forces effectively become integrated with Russia’s resurgent army.

That would put the Kremlin’s advanced weapons within striking distance of Central Europe, and of vital European trade routes such as the Bosphorus strait in Istanbul, which links Europe and Asia.

As the U.S. statesman and geopolitics expert Zbigniew Brzezinski has said: ‘Without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be an empire; but with Ukraine subordinated, Russia automatically becomes an empire.’

For their part, many Russian people have watched Ukrainian protests with awe and envy. Their own opposition movement has fizzled out — steamrollered by the ruthless Russian authorities. Yet many of them yearn for the modern, democratic life that we and 500 million others in Europe take for granted.

Now they despair.

Mr Putin and his cronies have looted tens of billions of dollars in the past decade from the hapless Russian nation. People who stand in their way are jailed, killed or exiled.

But to feel truly safe at home, the Kremlin also needs to feel safe abroad. Russians joke that the definition of a secure frontier is one with Russian troops on both sides.

As Ukrainians’ dreams of democracy and independence begin to perish in the blood-stained snows of Kiev, that prospect is coming closer by the day.

For Vladimir Putin wants to entrench his rule not only in Russia but in neighbouring countries with a new Eurasian Economic Union. Its name even apes that of the EU.

But in Mr Putin’s planned union, the Kremlin’s word will rule. He will deal not with ordinary voters but with men like Ukraine’s Mr Yanukovych, or the strongman leader of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, another friend of the Kremlin.

With the right mixture of threats and inducements, such men will do his will.

And Putin will not stop at Ukraine. He has imposed arbitrary trade sanctions on other countries which dare resist him, too, including Lithuania. Others are bribed into submission. He has just struck a deal with Hungary, offering its ruler, Viktor Orban, cheap gas in exchange for a contract to build a power station there. A similar deal is brewing in Slovakia.

Step by step, Russia is using the cudgel of its vast energy resources to restore power and influence in the lands it once ruled by force. And the West seems powerless to resist.

Already, Nato can scarcely defend the brave but beleaguered allies we have in the area: Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. And Russia and its satellite Belarus regularly rehearse plans for the invasion and occupation of these Baltic countries. Russia’s forces have even practised a nuclear attack on Warsaw.

This is not merely a matter of internal Ukrainian politics. The battle for Kiev also symbolises Russia's latest - and most audacious - bid to regain a hold over its former empire

The bitter irony is that the EU has huge powers to resist Russia — if it chooses to use them. It’s humbled giant corporations such as Microsoft for mistreating European consumers, imposing huge fines when it considered the company was abusing its market position.

It must do the same with Gazprom, Russia’s gas company, which throttles countries that resist the Kremlin by extorting high prices for gas sent over its monopolised pipelines.

A ‘complaint’ — EU jargon for a prosecution — is imminent. It could lead to billions of dollars in fines for the Russian gas giant. Britain and other countries should applaud that — and ensure that the pro-Russian lobby in Brussels does not try to derail it.

Europe should also respond to the trade sanctions Russia has imposed on its neighbours, which are a flagrant breach of international rules.

But the EU is instinctively unwilling to play geopolitics, and the idea of standing up to Russia is seen as confrontational and unnecessary.

Yet geopolitics is being played in front of our eyes in Ukraine and beyond — and we are losing.

We need to punish Mr Yanukovych and his regime for their thuggish behaviour. We need to stand by pro-Western Ukrainians, who ask for nothing more than a chance to embrace the Western values of liberty and justice in their own country.

Controversially, I believe that if, under a future pro-Western government, Ukraine meets our economic standards, it should have the right to join the European Union.

It might take a decade or more; but only that hope will spur change — and thwart the sinister ambitions of the brooding ogre in the Kremlin.

For now, the Western nations seem powerless in Ukraine. Yet we could impose sanctions on Mr Yanukovych and his henchmen, many of whom run murky business empires at home while also swanning around in luxury and respectability in London.

Investigations of their finances, and a ban on their families gaining visas to the West, would send a powerful signal. Ukrainians are fighting and dying for our values. But through our inaction, we are colluding with their oppressors.
