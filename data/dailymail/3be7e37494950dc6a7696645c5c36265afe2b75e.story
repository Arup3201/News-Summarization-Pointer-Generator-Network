Edward Snowden, the NSA contractor-turned-whistleblow, during a meeting in October. Although Snowden was not named in the NSA memo, his leaks have caused the agency serious problems

Conversation round the dinner table at Thanksgiving can be a testing time for some families, especially if your in-laws do not agree with your line of work.

But employees of the beleaguered National Security Agency need not have worried, after the organisation distributed a two-page list of talking points that would be suitable for holiday small talk.

The document, sent out on November 22, the Friday before Thanksgiving, appears to have been compiled to help employees defend the organisation, which has been hit by a series of intelligence leaks from Edward Snowden, the former NSA contractor-turned-whistleblower.

The document states that employees of the NSA, as well as the Central Security Service, are allowed to 'share the following points with family and close friends.'

The five points, which are divided into sub-sections and do not mention Mr Snowden by name, include: ' (1) NSA's mission is of great value to the Nation... (2) NSA performs its mission the right way - lawful, compliant, and in a way that protects civil liberties and privacy...

'(3) NSA performs its mission exceptionally well. We strive to be the best that we can be, because that's what America requires as part of its defense in a dangerous world...

NSA's mission is of great value to the Nation: part one of the five-part memo which lists what employees are allowed to discuss at the dinner table with family and friends

'(4) The people who work for NSA are loyal Americans with expert skills who make sacrifices to help protect the freedoms we all cherish...

'(5) NSA is committed to increased transparency, public dialog, and faithful implementation of any changes required by our overseers.'

In the first part of the Talking Points memo, obtained by Firedoglake, the NSA suggests highlighting that programmes protecting Americans and its allies have help thwart 54 terrorist events since the September 11, 2001 attacks, the majority of which have been in Europe. More than a dozen had a 'homeland nexis'.

In one of the five sections, the NSA emphasises that those working for the agency are 'loyal Americans'.It further states:

That figure has previously been challenged by opponents of the NSA.

A similar Talking Points memo obtained by Al Jazeera in October also found that the NSA encouraged pushing 9/11 as a justification for its surveillance tactics.

The memo moves on to emphasise that the NSA does not target US citizens 'unless that targeting is premised on a finding of probable cause to believe that the person is a foreign power or the agent of a foreign power.'

Unfortunately in the third section, whoever wrote the memo misspells the word 'terrorists', instead typing 'Terrorsts'.

It concludes by encouraging Americans to work with the agency 'to work with us to define the way ahead in balancing transparency and national security.'The Talking Points memo came before Alan Rusbridger, the editor of the Guardian newspaper, appeared before the Home Affairs Select Committe in Parliament.Mr Rusbridger, 59, told the committee during a heated evidence session that the newspaper had published approximately one per cent of the files they obtained from Mr Snowden.
