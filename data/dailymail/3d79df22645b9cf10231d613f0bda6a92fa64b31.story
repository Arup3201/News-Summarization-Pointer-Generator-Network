'Ruthless and resourceful': John Anslow was sprung from a prison van while on route to court

A man accused of murder escaped a prison van on his way to court after jail staff took shortcuts with security, a court has heard.

'Ruthless and resourceful criminal' John Anslow, 33, fled a secure van still in his handcuffs after it was held up by a gang of men wearing balaclavas and armed with a shotgun and sledgehammers.

Woolwich Crown Court heard that Anslow, who admitted conspiring to escape from custody, had just left HMP Hewell, near Redditch, Worcestershire, in January last year.

Prosecutors told the court that Anslow managed to smuggle a mobile phone out of prison after guards failed to perform proper checks despite the prisoner being classed as an escape risk.

Michael Burrows QC said that Anslow was strip searched and asked to squat by an officer on the morning he escaped.

But guards failed to make him sit on a special chair which scans inmates for electronic devices.

Mr Burrows said: 'That morning, none of the prisoners were scanned in that way.

'One of the prison officers says of that "it was staff just short-cutting the process to make it quicker".

'John Anslow was an E-lister (escape risk), following his search he should have been put in a holding cell on his own.

'But that morning, he wasn’t. He was put in a holding cell with at least 10 other prisoners who were also going to court that morning.'

He added that Anslow, of Tipton, West Midlands, 'is a ruthless and resourceful criminal who arranged his own escape with help from others'.

As his prison van was driven out of the jail’s grounds, a Volkswagen Scirocco pulled in front of it and three men got out and launched an attacked.

Gone: Anslow escaped from this prison van after another vehicle stopped in front of it and threatened guards with a shotgun and sledgehammers

Hunt: Police didn't catch Anslow until March this year, more than a year after he went on the run

Mr Burrows said in the moments beforehand another inmate who was also being transferred began asking Julie Curran, a prison officer escorting them, whether they were on camera, where they were going first and if there was another van in front of them.

Mr Burrows said: 'His questions prompted her to say to John Anslow "Bloody hell, John, you ain’t got nobody to hold this van up, have you?”’

Once the van was attacked the driver was pulled out of his seat and punched in the face by one of the attackers while another pointed what appeared to be a sawn-off shotgun at him.

Shortcuts: The court heard that security guards at the prison failed to carry out proper checks on Anslow before he left for court

Anslow told Miss Curran to let him go.

He fled while still wearing handcuffs.

He was eventually arrested on March 14 this year in north Cyprus and deported back to the UK.

Four other people - Paul Cadby, 47; Luke Hazel, 24; Moysha Shepherd, 23; and Ryan Powell, 21, all from Birmingham - have also admitted conspiring to free Anslow.

Ben O’Reilly, 30, Craig Wright, 29, Anslow’s partner Samantha Glover, 27, Daniel Morgan, 29, Robert Riddell, 41, and Stuart Reid, 52, all deny the same charge.

Failures: Anslow should have been placed alone in a custody cell at the prison before leaving for court, but was placed in a holding room with ten other inmates
