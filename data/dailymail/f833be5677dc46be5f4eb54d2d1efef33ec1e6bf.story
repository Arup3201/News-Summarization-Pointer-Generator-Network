Traffic ground to a halt, pedestrians stood still and radio and television fell silent for two minutes today, as Israel remembered the six million Jews killed by the Nazis.

As sirens pierced the air at 9am local time, the hustle and bustle on the streets of Jerusalem and elsewhere paused as citizens marked Israel's Holocaust Remembrance Day.

Buses and cars stopped on roads and highways. Many people stepped out of their vehicles and stood in silent observance of the solemn annual ritual.

Pedestrians stopped walking and stood still in contemplation.

Radio and television stations, which have been filling the airwaves with melancholic music and interviews with Holocaust survivors, also fell silent.

This year's memorial is focused on the memory of more than 400,000 Hungarian Jews who were massacred in 1944. Ceremonies are held around the country. Names of those killed are read out at parliament later in the day.

Israel began marking Holocaust Martyrs and Heroes Remembrance Day at sundown last night with a ceremony at the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum in Jerusalem, which commemorates the Jews, killed by the Nazi regime

It comes as the leader of the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank held out an olive branch to Israel by describing the Holocaust's as 'the most heinous crime against humanity' in modern times.

The announcement by Mahmoud Abbas appeared to be an attempt to reach out to the Israeli people at a time of deep crisis in longrunning, but so far fruitless, peace talks.

But Mr Netanyahu, Israel's hardline premier, responded by telling Mr Abbas he must end his reconciliation with rival Palestinian group Hamas, the elected government of Gaza.

Hamas is viewed by Israel and its allies in the U.S. and the European Union as a terrorist organisation committed to the destruction of the Jewish state.

Mr Abbas made his comments during a conversation with American rabbi Marc Schneier who visited his administration in Ramallah last week and they were reported by Palestinian news agency WAFA yesterday.

It quoted the West Bank leader as telling Mr Schneier that  'what happened to the Jews in the Holocaust is the most heinous crime to have occurred against humanity in the modern era.'

The agency quoted Abbas as expressing his 'sympathy with the families of the victims and many other innocent people who were killed'

Abbas said the Holocaust was an expression of the idea of ethnic discrimination and racism, and connected it to the Palestinian suffering of today.

'The Palestinian people, who suffer from injustice, oppression and [are] denied freedom and peace, are the first to demand to lift the injustice and racism that befell other peoples subjected to such crimes,' he said.

The Holocaust, known in Hebrew as Shoah, meaning 'the catastrophe', was the systematic slaughter of six million Jews in Nazi Germany and its occupied territories during the Second World War.

More than a million Jewish children were killed in the genocide, as were about two million Jewish woman and three million Jewish men.

Other targeted groups included homosexuals, people with disabilities, political and religious dissidents, Romani gypsies, non-Europeans, and Polish and Soviet civilians and prisoners of war.

Every arm of Germany's bureaucracy was involved in the logistics of the scheme, turning the Third Reich into what one Holocaust scholar has called 'a genocidal state'.
