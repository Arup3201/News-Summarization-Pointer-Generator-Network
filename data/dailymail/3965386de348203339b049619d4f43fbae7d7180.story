Shaken up: Tamara Ecclestone claims she is being blackmailed by someone threatening to reveal details of her relationship with an unnamed man

Police are investigating an attempt to blackmail socialite Tamara Ecclestone.

The alleged blackmailer threatened to reveal details of a relationship between the daughter of billionaire Formula 1 boss Bernie Ecclestone and an unidentified man unless she paid a ‘tidy sum’, according to a source.

The amount involved could be as much as six figures, the source added.

Metropolitan Police officers are investigating the suspected blackmail attempt after Miss Ecclestone, 27, reported an alleged ‘inappropriate communication’ on Monday.

One source told the Mail: ‘Tamara has been really shaken up by all this.

‘It has been a huge weight on her mind so she decided she had no option but to go to the police.’

Miss Ecclestone’s 82-year-old father is estimated to be worth £2.5billion.

He recently bought her a £45million house on one of London’s most desirable streets in Kensington.

Miss Ecclestone is having £18million of renovations carried out on the 55-room property. These include installing an underground nightclub, bowling alley, beauty salon and a dog spa for her five pets.

Other additions will be a vast dressing room to store her wardrobe – and £500,000 handbag collection – and a vehicle lift for her supercars.

Miss Ecclestone recently admitted her lavish lifestyle made her a ‘prime target’ for criticism in gloomy economic times, but claimed she was ‘like any other girl’.

She said: ‘People assume I’m a monster, have no emotions, and bad things haven’t happened to me.

‘I’m vulnerable like every other girl in the world – good days, bad days.’

In
August, her younger sister Petra, 23, was married in a £12million 
extravaganza in Italy paid for by Mr Ecclestone and his ex-wife, former 
Armani model Slavica, the mother of both heiresses.

Miss
Ecclestone, whose parents divorced in 2009 after 23 years of marriage,
recently featured in the Channel 5 series Billion Dollar Girl, a 
three-part documentary detailing her extravagant life.

She has been dating stockbroker Omar 
Khyami, 37, since last year. She recently told how he had already agreed
to sign a prenuptial agreement if they married.

She said: ‘We have talked about it [a 
prenup]. I’ve never brought it up, but when my sister’s wedding came 
round, Omar said he would want that, which is so nice.’

A
Metropolitan Police spokesman said yesterday: ‘On Monday December 5 
police from Kensington and Chelsea borough received a complaint 
regarding an inappropriate communication relating to the release of 
personal information.

‘The 
allegation was assessed and is now being investigated at this early 
stage as blackmail. CID in Kensington and Chelsea are investigating.

‘No one has been arrested. Inquiries continue.’ 

A spokesman for Miss Ecclestone said: ‘Tamara is aware of the matter and the police are handling it on her behalf.’
