Musician: Talented violinist Natalie Holt said she wanted to protest against Simon Cowell and miming on television

The violinist who pelted Simon Cowell with eggs in the live final of Britain’s Got Talent explained her actions yesterday.

Natalie Holt said she was protesting at both his domination of the music industry and performers miming on television.

But in turn, she was accused of targeting the music mogul during Saturday’s show as part of a publicity stunt to raise her profile.

Millions of viewers saw the 30-year-old musician, a Bafta-nominated composer, walk to the front of the stage carrying a box of eggs, as singers Richard and Adam were performing.

With a wide grin, she then began hurling eggs at Cowell, 53.

Miss Holt, described as an ‘upstanding young woman’ by her mother, has claimed she was venting her anger after apparently being asked to pretend to play her violin.

The ex-grammar school pupil, who has a masters degree from The National Film and Television School, was one of a number of backing musicians and singers asked to perform when the Welsh brothers were on stage.

She told the Daily Mail: ‘I took a stand against people miming on television and against Simon Cowell and against his influence on the music industry.’

However while Cowell appeared to take the incident in good humour, he is said to have been 'absolutely furious' off camera after the safety of himself and his panel was called into doubt.

A source told the Daily Star newspaper: 'During the break, Simon stormed backstage and told one producer that she could have had a gun.

He wasn't so bothered about having been hit by an egg but he was furious that the welfare of not only the judges but also the contestants and the audience could have been at risk.'

However, following the incident, some critics took to Twitter to accuse Miss Holt of a publicity stunt.

And her friends admitted it was not a spontaneous protest and that she had discussed in advance how she might draw attention to the issue of miming on the show.

She had even said that one way to do this might have been to smash her violin during the performance.

One said: ‘Goodness only knows how she managed to smuggle half a dozen eggs on to the stage.

'Normally if you are a woman playing, all you are allowed to take with you is a small clutch bag, or something similar. Not something big enough to fit a box of eggs inside.’

Protest: Miss Holt was grinning and laughing as she threw the eggs at the judges

A report following the incident 
suggested that Miss Holt had even described the type of eggs in a 
bizarre defense of her actions.

A source told The Sun: 'There was one
 very surreal moment when she started going on about the fact the eggs 
were organic and from Marks & Spencer. It was like that made 
everything all right. It was very odd.'

Miss Holt has since apologised, but 
her boyfriend Chris Waitt said: ‘Britain’s Got Talent basically 
pressured her into apologising so they wouldn’t press charges. She had 
to say it was a silly thing to do when really she doesn’t think it was.

‘She
 objects to those kind of shows and to Simon Cowell and what he 
represents to the music industry. She’s not after personal publicity, 
she just wanted to make a point.’

Miss Holt did not leave her flat in Covent Garden yesterday, where she lives with her boyfriend, 39.

Target: Miss Holt picked out Simon Cowell as she wanted to make a point about his dominance of the music industry

There
 have been suggestions she may have targeted Cowell as revenge after she
 auditioned for Britain’s Got Talent in 2012 with string quartet Raven, 
who performed with Madness at the Olympics closing ceremony.

The
 group got through the first round but were axed before the live shows, 
prompting an angry internet blog post saying: ‘So Raven went on BGT. It 
was hellish.’

Miss Holt
 was defended by her mother Patricia, 62, who lives in a large detached 
cottage in the village of Loose, near Maidstone, Kent, with her husband 
Malcolm, 70.

She said: ‘We are not Britain’s Got 
Talent watchers, so we don’t know what all the fuss is about, except I 
know there’s a lot of strong feeling about Simon Cowell and his 
influence on the music industry. He does monopolise things, doesn’t he?

‘I
 suppose the big point is that you have got all those people at the 
front and the people who really know about music are sitting at the back
 miming. I think Natalie feels quite strongly about live music being 
live.’

Miss Holt's uncle Brian Butt, who lives in Norway, said: 'Unfortunately for her, it gave the impression she was a bit of a nutter - which, believe me, she's not.

'I thought it was some kind of prank the show had got her to do to make it more interesting.'

A BGT spokesman 
said miming was ‘standard industry practice for backing musicians during
 TV performances as it isn’t possible to easily capture the quality of 
the sound in a live broadcast environment. All contestants on Britain’s 
Got Talent sing live.’
