Investigation: The body could be that of Latvian Alisa Dmitrijeva, 17, from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire. She vanished last August

The body found on the Queen’s estate at Sandringham could be a girl as young as 15, police said yesterday.

And fears were growing that it could be a 17-year-old student missing in the area since last August.

A murder investigation was launched after the remains were discovered by a dog walker in a copse close to where the Royal Family had gathered for their  Boxing Day shoot.

Yesterday police described the body as 
that of a white woman, aged between 15 and 23.

The body had been lying 
on the Norfolk estate for between one month and four months.

Detectives are examining missing person cases to see if they can find a match.

These include the disappearance of Alisa Dmitrijeva, 17, who went missing shortly after midnight on August 31 last year.

She was last spotted in a green Lexus GS800 car in the centre of King’s Lynn, about ten miles from where the body was found.

The 5ft 6in Latvian-born student was reported missing a week later by a 
relative.

Detectives said she often stayed with friends for several 
days, but previously had always remained in touch with her family while 
she was away.

Police say the circumstances suggest that the woman was murdered and are now looking at cold case files across the country

Last month police put up a £5,000 reward for information which would help locate her.

Officers also distributed posters with her photograph and created a 
Facebook advert in a bid to track her down, translating it into Latvian 
and Lithuanian.

They also trawled through hours of CCTV images and made numerous house-to-house inquiries.

Alisa lived with her father Olegs Dmitrijeva, her sister Victoria,  ten,
and grandmother Lidija Nesterova, 62, in a rented semi-detached  house 
in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire.

She was due to enroll on a new course at the College of West Anglia the day after she disappeared.

Yesterday her grandmother said she had been visited by police and told 
that the body of an unidentified young woman had been found at 
Sandringham.

But Mrs Nesterova continues to cling on to the hope that her 
granddaughter is still alive. Fighting back tears, she said: ‘Alisa is 
missing. Alisa is not dead.’

A neighbour, who asked not to be named, added: ‘Alisa seemed like a nice
girl. I last saw her in August just before she disappeared.

The remains were found by a dog-walker in woods at the village of Anmer

Missing: Another missing East European from Cambridgeshire, 29-year-old Lithuanian Vitalija Baliutaviciene, is also a possible victim

'Once she was at home playing some “thump, thump music” which was 
disturbing my wife, who was poorly. I went round to ask her to turn it 
down.

‘To be fair to her, she said sorry and turned it down which was nice of 
her.

'After she went missing, I had the police round asking questions 
about her.’

Another neighbour, Ricardo Moreira, 32, said: ‘The police came round 
three times asking about her when she disappeared. I couldn’t help 
because I did not know her.

‘The Latvian community tend not to mix with other people in  Wisbech. They just socialise in their own groups.’

Norfolk Police are waiting for a DNA profile of the victim. They are 
finding it hard to identify the body because it is significantly 
decomposed and there were no identification documents found at the 
scene.

Another possible victim is another East Euorpean from Cambridgeshire, 29-year-old Vitalija Baliutaviciene.

Lithuanian Ms Baliutaviciene, of Peterborough, also went missing on August 12, and has not been seen since 5am that day.

Rimas Venclovas, 46, who was extradited from Lithuania, has been charged with her kidnap and murder but no body has been found.

Detective Chief Inspector Jes Fry said: ‘We will be focusing on all 
local missing persons and then spread our catchment area depending on 
how our investigation goes.

Macabre discovery: The human remains were found on the Queen's estate at Sandringham less than a mile from where the Royal family gathered for Christmas (bottom left)

Sandringham is the private country estate of Her Majesty the Queen.

It is the property of the British royal family and not part of the Crown Estate.

In 1862, Sandringham hall was purchased by Queen Victoria at the request of the Prince of Wales (the future Edward VII).

But the Prince decide it was too small and had it knocked down and the current house built on the site.

King George VI was born at York Cottage on the estate and died in 1952 at the house.

Since then Queen Elizabeth spends the anniversary of her father's death and her own Accession privately with her family at the house.

It is her official base until February each year and she is joined by the rest of the Royal family over Christmas.

The house was first opened to the public in 1977, and there is a museum with displays of Royal life and Estate history.

'Part of the post-mortem will try to 
establish the identification through fingerprints or DNA which may help 
us identify who the victim is more quickly.

‘Hopefully in the next day or so we will have a good idea who we are dealing with and that may open fresh lines of inquiry.

‘I cannot confirm whether she was clothed because, at the moment, only 
my staff, the person who found the body and the person or people who put
it there know that – and I would like it to stay that way.

‘It is very early days on the forensic side of things.

'It could be a challenging investigation.

‘We ask the public to cast their minds back to see if they can remember anything.’

Officers yesterday continued to search the area around where the body was found.

The 30ft-wide copse where the body was found sits between two fields and
is 200 yards along a farm track.

It is one mile from the entrance to 
Sandringham House and half a mile from the Sandringham Stud where the 
Queen breeds racehorses.

The Royal Family are thought to have been shooting in a field of sugar beet next to the copse last week.
