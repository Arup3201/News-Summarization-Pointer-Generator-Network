Defence: The campaign refutes claims that aspartame is unhealthy

Coca-Cola has launched an advertisement campaign to defend the use of sweeteners in their diet soda.

The advertisement is the next phase of a campaign to push back at critics who blame Coca-Cola’s products for the U.S’s ever-rising obesity rates.

The Diet Coke ad, which features two smiling women drinking the soda, comes shortly after Coca-Cola reported a drop in sales.

In this year’s second quarter, Coca-Cola Co. reported a four per cent loss in the amount of soda sold in North America, with Diet Coke taking the worst hit.

In 2012 sales volume for Coke fell one per cent, while Diet Coke fell 3 per cent. Rivalling cola brand Pepsi fell 3.4 per cent, while Diet Pepsi fell 6.2 per cent.

The decline in sales of fizzy drinks has been a long-running trend in the U.S. following reports of negative effects on health and several studies on possible hazards of consuming artificial sweeteners.

Coca-Cola’s campaign kicks off in the Atlanta area with print ads in USA Today, Atlanta Journal Constitution and the Chicago Tribune.

The advertisement highlights how diet soda can help people manage their weight and stresses the scientific evidence showing the safety of aspartame.

It  features a picture of two women under the heading ‘Quality products you can always feel good about,’ with several paragraphs of text underneath. 

‘Time and again, these low- and no-calorie sweeteners have shown to be safe, high-quality alternatives to sugar,’ it states.

‘Coke is trying to get out front and proactively defend these diet sweeteners,’ said John Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest, which tracks the industry.

The declines come even though the Food and Drug Administration says aspartame may be safely used in foods as a sweetener, and the ingredient can be found in a wide array of other type of drinks and foods.

The American Cancer Society also notes 
that most studies using people have found that aspartame is not linked 
to an increased risk of cancer, including the largest study on the 
topic.

Another explanation to the decline in sales of products with artificial sweeteners is the recent trend of organic and natural ingredients.

Aspartame, used in Diet Coke under the brand name NutraSweet, is an artificial product 200 times sweeter than sugar.

The safety of the product has been a hot topic since its U.S. approval in 1981, but there is no evidence of any detrimental effects on health if consumed in normal doses.

It has been found safe for human consumption in more than 90 countries, with an EU wide approval in 1994.

The majority of Aspartame consumption comes in the form of diet soft drinks with a standard can of soda containing 180mg of aspartame.

This means that a 165lbs adult would need to drink approximately 21 12oz cans of diet soda to exceed the recommended daily rate.

‘Even if (aspartame is) 100 per cent safe to use, it's still problematic from a nutrition standpoint,’ said Andy Bellatti, a registered dietician based in Las Vegas who is critical of the food industry's marketing practices.

Bellatti noted that foods and drinks aren't good for people just because they don't have any calories or have been shown to be safe. He added that ingredients such as aspartame only keep people hooked on sweets over more wholesome choices.

This summer, Coca-Cola rolled out a version of its namesake soda sweetened with natural sweetener stevia in Argentina, a smaller market where it can better gauge how the drink performs.

Caren Pasquale Seckler, vice president of social commitment at Coca-Cola, said the goal is to clear up the confusion around diet sweeteners. She said the company will gauge the response in Atlanta and Chicago before expanding the push.

‘This is a beginning and it's a learning process, but we do have plans to do more,’ she said.
