Two people have been killed and at least seven others remain missing after three Ugandan helicopter gunships crashed into Kenya's highest mountain in bad weather.

The Russian-built Mi-24 'Hind' 
helicopters were travelling to Somalia to help fight al-Qaida-linked 
militants when they crashed on Sunday.

Rescue workers today recovered two dead bodies and continue to search for at least seven soldiers and airmen around the crash sites in the rugged landscape of Mount Kenya.

Simon Gitau, deputy warden of Mt. 
Kenya National Park, said rescue workers saw two bodies outside of one 
helicopter that crashed and burned. He said he did not know if other 
bodies were inside the wreckage.

'We did not search through the wreckage because it was still burning and smoldering,' Gitau said. 
Five personnel were rescued from a second crash site discovered on Tuesday, Gitau said.

A third Ugandan military helicopter 
that crashed was found on Monday and the occupants rescued.

No one was 
killed in that crash that wrecked the aircraft beyond repair and only 
one injury was reported.

A total of four Ugandan military helicopters were en route to Somalia to fight al-Qaida-linked militants

Search-and-rescue teams reached 
one of the crash sites Tuesday at around 12,000 feet up Mount Kenya, 
said Brigadier Francis Ogolla, the commander of Kenya's Laikipia Air 
Base near Mount Kenya. He told a press conference that the other 
helicopter was spotted from the air at the edge of a cliff.

Ogolla said the helicopters had taken
off in formation from Laikipia Air Base at around 4:50 p.m. on Sunday 
en route to the northern Kenya town of Garissa, where the helicopters 
were to refuel before proceeding to Somalia.

One hour later only one 
helicopter landed in Garissa and the pilot said he had lost 
communication with the other three, Ogolla said.

Weather around Mount Kenya- Africa's 
second tallest peak at 5,199 meters (17,057 feet) - can be erratic. 
Heavy clouds and wind would be common this time of year, with 
precipitation coming in the form of rain or snow.

The three helicopters that crashed were Mi-24 gunships. The fourth helicopter that landed safely was an Mi-17.

Ugandan
President Yoweri Museveni ordered an investigation to be led by his 
brother - a retired army general - in a sign of how serious Ugandan 
authorities are taking the loss of lives.

Neither
Kenyan nor Ugandan authorities could yet say why three of four military
helicopters making the trip crashed. Ugandan officials said preliminary
information indicated that bad weather was responsible.

Mount
Kenya - Africa's second-highest peak - has been shrouded in clouds even
as rescuers tried to locate the wreckage from Sunday's crashes.

One
point to be investigated will be whether the pilots took the wrong 
flight path. Concerns were raised in Uganda that the well-trained crew 
flew too close to Mount Kenya. A Ugandan official insisted that there 
was nothing wrong with the helicopters.

The three helicopters that crashed were Russian made Mi-24 gunships. A fourth helicopter that landed safely was an Mi-17 transporter

'They were inspected... and found to be airworthy,' Jeje Odongo, Uganda's deputy minister of defense, said of the Russian Mi-24 helicopters.

Odongo said that all the crew had been trained by the U.N. and that 'they all passed the competence tests' before flying out of Uganda.

Odongo said the trip to Somalia had been planned three months in advance and that the aircraft have been used over the years for missions, including the hunt for the notorious rebel leader Joseph Kony, the leader of the Lord's Resistance Army.

The unexplained crashes will set back efforts by a multinational African force to battle Islamist militant group, al-Shabab, which is linked to al-Qaida.

The U.N. Security Council in February approved funds for nine transport helicopters and three attack helicopters to be used by African Union forces in Somalia. The AU troops have been fighting al-Shabab for years without the use of helicopters. The Ugandan military forms the bulk of the African Union forces in Somalia.

Ugandan and Burundian forces pushed al-Shabab out of Mogadishu about a year ago. Helicopters will further aid their counterinsurgency efforts.

Kenya and Burundi have also dispatched to troops to fight al-Shabab, which neighboring countries view as a regional threat.

The Islamist militants are now concentrated in the southern coast town of Kismayo, which is likely to be the next scene of serious fighting.

Somalia has not had a stable government since 1991, when longtime dictator Siad Barre was ousted by warlords who then turned on each other.
