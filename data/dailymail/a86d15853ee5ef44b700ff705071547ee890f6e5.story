A grandmother got a nasty wake-up call when she found a dead mouse in her packet of Kellogg's Crunchy Nut Cornflakes.

Pauline Henderson, 50, was pouring a bowl of newly-opened cereal for her grandson Toby when the rodent's body dropped into the bowl.

She spotted it among the flakes and managed to stop the two-year-old from tucking in, but was left 'disgusted' by the stomach-churning find.

The dead mouse Pauline Henderson found inside a box of Kellogg's Crunchy Nut Cornflakes

Ms Henderson, a security officer, fears she would have had to rush her grandson to hospital if he had eaten the mouse.

She has complained to the Tesco supermarket in Portsmouth, Hants, where she bought the 1kg box of cereal.

Ms Henderson, who has six grandchildren, said she loves having her grandson to stay and bought the cereal for him especially.

After pouring out the cornflakes she noticed something 'black', so took a closer look.

She said: 'I knew something wasn't right, so I got a spoon and gingerly moved the flakes out of the way.

'Then I saw the mouse. It was horrible and I felt absolutely sick.'

Her grandson, Toby, was initially unaware of the find and was standing beside Ms Henderson saying 'cornies, cornies'.

Ms Henderson added: 'Goodness knows how long the mouse was in the box or if it was dead or alive when it went in.

'I have put the box and the mouse in the freezer for now because I want environmental health or Kellogg's to come and look at it.

'It's put me off buying any Crunchy Nut ever again.'

Ms Henderson said before discovering the rodent, the cereal was unopened and had been stored in a kitchen cupboard.

She has since complained to the Tesco store where she bought the cereal, and has notified Environmental Health officials.

Kellogg's are investigating how the mouse, seen here in the cereal bowl, came to be inside the packet and Tesco, where Ms Henderson purchased the cereal, said they would 'support' their supplier's investigation

Ms Henderson said her complaint to Tesco wasn't taken seriously: 'The first man that served me laughed and I thought 'It's not funny, do you see me laughing?'

The store manager then asked her for a receipt for the purchase, but she couldn't find it.

Ms Henderson added: 'I've been back since and all the cereal boxes are still on the shelves - but if one of them had a mouse any one of the others could too.'

Tesco said it was 'concerned' by the incident.

A spokesman said: 'We set ourselves the highest standards for the quality and safety of the food we sell and were concerned to hear of this.

'We would like to thank Ms Henderson for alerting us and we will work with the supplier to support their investigation.'

Ms Henderson said she had also spoken to Kellogg's who had offered her a new box of cereal, which she declined.

Kellogg's are investigating how the mouse came to be in the box, and said 'it hasn't happened before'.

A spokesman added: 'We take food safety extremely seriously and carry out regular quality checks in our factories.'
