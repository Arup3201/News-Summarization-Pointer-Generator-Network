The pictures show people trying to make the best of a bad situation as the mounds of rubbish at the site in Dhaka have become an accepted part of their daily lives.

The rubbish at Matuail, the largest waste site in Dhaka, is a product of over three and a half million people and 65 per cent of the total waste generated in the city.

Cristiano Ostinelli, the Italian photographer who recently visited the site, said:

'The Landfill was almost all organic waste so the smell was just awful, it smelt like vomit.

'It was appalling to see children with rags of clothes with their hands in something inexplicable. It was like hell on earth.'

Waste management workers only earn a dollar a day but amazingly, these conditions are an improvement.

The site was recently transformed from an open dump to a controlled landfill with perimeter drainage, site roads, site control offices and an electronic weighbridge

Incredibly all of the upgrading was done while Matuali received 1500 tonnes of waste per day and the site is now one of the best examples of a controlled waste site in South Asia

Two years ago, local government made the decision to upgrade the standard of disposal at the site utilizing finances from the Japanese debt-cancellation fund.
