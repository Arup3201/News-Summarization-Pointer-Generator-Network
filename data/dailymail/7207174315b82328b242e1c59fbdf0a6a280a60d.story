Like magic: Paul Daniels, 76, pictured with wife Debbie, has been helped with his 'trigger finger'

Paul Daniels is renowned for his sleight of hand, whether dealing a pack of cards or (appearing to) saw his wife and assistant, ‘the lovely Debbie McGee’, in half.

But a year ago, while the veteran magician was performing a card move for a packed audience, he realised things weren’t going according to plan. The old dexterity was missing.

‘The ring finger of my right hand had locked into a bent position,’ he says.

‘I improvised my way out of it by pressing the finger against my body and clicking it back into shape, before continuing the trick.

‘One of the reasons my magic tricks don’t go wrong is because I never tell the audience what I’m going to do, so I can swing round and change direction. But it was a close-run thing!’

After consulting his GP, Paul, 76, was referred to Donald Sammut, a specialist hand surgeon, who treated him two years earlier when he severed his left index finger with a saw while making props for his act.

Mr Sammut diagnosed the problem as trigger finger, also known as stenosing tenosynovitis, which causes the fingers or thumb to catch or lock when bent or straightened. About three in every 100 people are affected.

‘Usually, the tendon [a band of tissue that connects the muscles and bones] fits perfectly in a tunnel [sheath] and glides easily,’ he says.

‘But if it wears in a particular area, the fibres break and form a lump where they heal.

‘When you flex your fingers and try to open them again, the tendon snags in the narrowest part of the tunnel and sticks, leaving your finger in a bent position. As the lump repeatedly rubs against the narrowest part of the tunnel, the tendon becomes inflamed and soon begins to hurt.’

The condition arises among people from all walks of life and ages – even young children. ‘You rarely find a cause, although trigger finger is more common in people with diabetes and inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis,’ says Mr Sammut.

‘Paul’s condition was probably longstanding and, I suspect, aggravated by the fact that he makes his own magic props.’

Mild trigger finger may improve without treatment or after taking anti-inflammatory drugs, but if the problem doesn’t disappear after a few days it is advisable to visit your GP, who may be able to treat it by a cortisone (steroids, an anti-inflammatory) injection.

Quick fix: How the six-minute operation to treat stenosing tenosynovitis is carried out

This cures about 50 per cent of patients. For more severe cases, the injection may buy time, but the condition is likely to resurface.

Paul says: ‘It is painful – a shooting pain up my finger. Last year I had an injection which flattened the tendon and released the finger, but when the problem returned, the specialist suggested a minor operation, which would probably mean it never came back.’

Paul underwent the six-minute procedure under local anaesthetic at Circle Reading Hospital in Berkshire earlier this year. ‘The preparation and injections took longer than the op itself and I didn’t feel a thing,’ he says.

The surgeon makes a 1cm cut across the base of the finger at about the level of the palm crease. A small incision is made into the place where the tendon is stuck, which is usually enough to release it, or a piece of the sheath can be removed. The wound is then stitched and dressed.

Mr Sammut says: ‘I always stress to patients that it’s vital to keep the hand above the level of the heart afterwards, otherwise the finger swells and you may experience bleeding around the tendon, which might cause it to stick again. In Paul’s case, I put his hand in a sling to keep it elevated. You must also keep flexing the finger through the full range.’

Mr Sammut is confident that Paul will regain full use of his finger.

Paul’s stitches were removed after two weeks and his finger is much improved. ‘I have enough movement to get back to work. There is such a range of magic that if the sleights of hand have to be changed, so be it. And if they become impossible, there are thousands of tricks that can be done without digital dexterity.’
