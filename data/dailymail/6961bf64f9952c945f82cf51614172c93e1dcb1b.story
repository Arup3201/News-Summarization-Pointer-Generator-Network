Former New Orleans Saints safety Steve Gleason has shown himself to be a far bigger person than the three Atlanta disc jockeys who were fired for making fun of him this week.

Just one day after the sports DJs were let go, Gleason, who battles amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, said in a statement that he had received and accepted their 'genuine' apologies and added that he hopes the incident will bring much-needed attention to the disease.

'We have all made mistakes in this life,' the 36-year-old father-of-one wrote on his Facebook page today. 'How we learn from our mistakes is the measure of who we are.'

He added: 'I think everyone can learn from this event. It's clear to me that, on a national & global scale, ALS is not understood, which is part of why its under funded and largely ignored.'

Gleason, who has lost the ability to talk or move, said the upshot of the DJs jibe was that at least ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, was now in the news and he thanked the public for their support.

'In the past 36 hours lots of people have been talking. Let's talk about this...' he wrote. 'There are zero treatments for ALS. If you take any action as a result of this event, I prefer it to be action to end ALS. See what we are doing to change that @ teamgleason.org.'

The show, Mayhem in the AM, was 
broadcast on 790 The Zone Monday morning. In a statement later in the 
day, general manager Rick Mack said the station regretted the 
insensitive comments made by shockjocks Nick Cellini, Steak Shapiro and Chris Dimino.

Regarding the DJ skit in Atlanta yesterday (Monday). I would like to thank the public for their support.

'Defend Team Gleason' now has been officially redefined.

Additionally, the DJs have provided genuine apology. Received and accepted. We have all made mistakes in this life. How we learn from our mistakes is the measure of who we are.

I think everyone can learn from this event. Its clear to me that, on a national & global scale, ALS is not understood, which is part of why its under funded and largely ignored.

In the past 36 hours lots of people have been talking. Lets talk about this... There are zero treatments for ALS.

If you take any action as a result of this event, I prefer it to be action to end ALS. See what we are doing to change that @ teamgleason.org. SG

On the show, one host, pretending to be Gleason, told a series of jokes. According to USA Today, one of the jokes told was: 'Knock, knock,' 'Who's there?' 'Smother,' 'Smother who?' 'Smother me, do me a favor?'

Gleason communicates, and wrote an article on Monday for Sports Illustrated, using eye-tracking technology.

The station lists the hosts as Cellini, Shapiro and Dimino. But Mack didn't give the names of those fired. 

During
the segment, two of the on-air personalities took a call from a third 
host who pretended to be Gleason by using a voice that sounded automated
- mimicking another famous ALS patient, Stephen Hawking.

The host mimicking Gleason told a number of jokes and eventually asked the two others to do him a favor by smothering him.

All three took to Twitter Monday evening to apologize to fans and others who criticized the segment.

Nick Cellini tweeted: 'My apologies 
to everyone. It was a stupid attempt at humor that backfired. Emphasis 
on stupid.' He has since appeared to delete his Twitter account.

Chris
Dimino said: 'I have so.many people I have to apologize to. I know this
is not who I am...but it is who I am today. An apology here means 
nothing if I... Don't reach out to all the people I need to. I am in 
that process as we speak. Friends and family and most importantly those I
know I hurt.'

Steak 
Shapiro tweeted: 'I love the people and city of New Orleans, always 
have, always will, @team_gleason I will work tirelessly to make this up 
to you....

Remorse: Chris Dimino was also sacked. He said: 'I have so many people I have to apologize to'

'What a moronic 2 mins, I am truly 
sorry.... ALS not a joke, bit or game. 20 yrs on the air, 2 bad mins on a
show, look at the whole picture I hope. Zone was a great ride!! 
#thebest' he continued.

Listeners and critics turned to the station's Facebook page to call for the hosts' termination.

Gleason played for the Saints between 2000 and 2006.

Team Gleason, an organization named after the former NFL player, is geared toward finding a cure for ALS, raising awareness of the disease and connecting patients to technology, equipment and services tailored to fit their needs.

In an article on the New Orleans Saints website this week, Gleason revealed that he needs the help of friends and family to get out of bed each day. After rising, he is stretched for 25-30 minutes before showering, which usually takes 45 minutes.

In addition, it takes an hour or two to be dressed, fed, and into his wheelchair, with its computer ready, to start the day.

The man who used to spend his days training on a football field inevitably gets down when he considers how the aggressive disease has changed him and what it still has in store.

But his 19-month-old Rivers is his continual motivating factor, he said.

His partner Michel Gleason said: 'In order to thrive with this disease you need a few things – number one a good support system and number two you need some type of purpose in life to live and fight.

With Steve, he's started a foundation in order to help with that purpose, but it's not even comparable to how important Rivers has been to him.'
