 An animal loving couple who adopted a one legged stray
dog from Romania are trying to raise nearly £4,000 - to buy her a set of
prosthetic limbs.

Vanessa Bamkin and her husband Roger have taken in
four-year-old Glory as one of the family after seeing pictures of her on a dog
re-homing site on Facebook.

Glory was living as a stray on the streets but was looked after by factory worker called Manuela Moncanu, who would feed her every day.

Glory had to be re-homed by the charity that rescued her because they could not afford the specialist treatment and equipment that she needs to have a normal life

But when he went away for a week she was viciously attacked and had to
have her front legs and part of one of her back legs amputated.

And although she has now settled into her new home in
Carlisle, Cumbria, Glory still struggles to get around and keep up with
Vanessa's three other dogs.

The family believe that fitting her with prosthetic limbs
is the best way to give her a chance at a normal life, even though it could
cost as much as £4,000.

Mrs Bamkin said she was moved to tears when she saw the
terrible condition Glory had been left in.  

She said:  ‘When I
saw all about Glory's situation on Facebook I was close to tears and I said to
my husband - we need to help her.

‘My husband was a bit more sceptical and thought it may
have been a scam - of course sending money to Romania is a giant leap of faith,
but it has been worth it to give Glory a new start.’

Transporting a dog from Romania to the UK is an expensive
and difficult process but the Bamkin family never wavered.

Glory needed vaccinations and checks before she could
leave the country but donations came in from Holland, Germany and the UK and
350 Euros were raised to pay for her passport and medical care.

Vanessa and her husband picked up the bill for Glory to
travel the 1,887 miles in a sprinter van over three days from Bucharest to the UK
and she finally arrived with her new family just over a week ago.

Glory was a stray in Romania but was looked after by factory worker called Manuela Moncanu who would feed her every day but when he went away for a week she was attacked

Since then Vanessa has wasted no time in trying to
improve Glory's life and the family are waiting to get her a wheely cart to
help her move around.

Vanessa added: ‘She has learnt to walk on her front
stumps, similar to if we were to crawl on our elbows.

‘She has been incredibly brave and we want to help her
get around as normal.’

The Bamkins are currently saving up to buy her a
prosthetic back leg in order to help her balance on her wheels, but Vanessa
said her dream would be to pay for Glory to have three prosthetics, so she
could run around like other dogs.

She said: ‘We will see how she gets on with the one
prosthetic leg but I am prepared to do all I can to help her.

‘The total cost of one prosthetic is £1365.33, but if we
were lucky enough to raise £3350, that would cover all three, and the mobility
that all three would give Glory would be incredible.

New owners Vanessa and Roger Bamkin had to hire a sprinter van for three days to transport Glory the 1,887 miles from Bucharest to Carlisle

‘I would love to be able to help Glory walk again and I
will save up if I have to.'

Since Glory arrived in the UK Mrs Bamkin has set up a
donation page to try to raise funds from other animal lovers, and said that
people ‘have been so generous so far.’

Corina Ana, who co-ordinates the care and adoption of the
stray dogs in Romania, said it was important that Glory be re-homed because the
centre in her home country could not afford the specialist care she needed.

She said: ‘I have been helping dogs to be re-homed
internationally for the past eight or nine months but Glory had the most major
handicap I had ever seen on a dog we have helped.

‘I am thrilled she has been adopted. We couldn't afford
to offer her a garden and a cart to help her walk so we thought the best thing
would be to put her up for adoption.

‘I am so pleased she has a family now who are looking after
her so well.’
