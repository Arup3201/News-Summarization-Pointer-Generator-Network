England’s Gemma Gibbons had to settle for a silver medal in her judo final last night but her household still took home one gold medal when husband Euan Barton triumphed for Scotland a few minutes later.

Gibbons, 27, insisted she had failed: ‘I came here for one thing only and that was the gold so I’m disappointed with myself.’

But some consolation arrived within a few minutes, watching from the sidelines as Scotland’s opening ceremony flag-bearer Barton overpowered Shah Hussain Shah of Pakistan in the  -100kg division. A beam crossed Gibbons’s face and she shed a few tears of pride.

Then, as 
Barton stood talking to journalists about the relief of landing his own 
target, his wife behind him, patting him playfully on the bottom as a 
first gesture of ‘well done’ before walking away without another word.

The
 pair started this Games with dreams of leaving Glasgow 2014 as a golden
 couple. Gibbons wanted to go one better than the silver she won so 
emotionally at London 2012. There she dropped to dropped to her knees 
after her semi-final, looked skywards and whispered ‘I love you, Mum’. 
Her mum had died eight years previously, when Gibbons was 17.

She came here on the back of fresh adversity — serious wrist, shoulder and ankle problems.Barton’s
 London 2012 could not have ended more despondently as he lost in the 
first round when hoping to go all the way to gold.

In
 a memorably frank and downbeat interview at the time, he said: ‘I’ve 
let myself down, let my coaches down, let everybody I’ve ever trained 
with down, let my mum and dad down.’

Mixed emotions: Gibbons was gutted to only get silver but she was pleased to see her husband grab gold

Now it was Gibbons with the self-criticism.

‘That
 wasn’t good I’m afraid,’ she said of her final defeat to Wales’s 
Natalie Powell. ‘I wasn’t the better player today. It’s not good enough.
 I know I can still be the best in the country and the best in the world
 otherwise I wouldn’t be training every day.

‘This might have been a little bit soon for me but you can always say that.

‘Yes, I’ve had injuries and only been back a month or so after the shoulder op but I wasn’t good enough today.’

Barton
 had effectively quit after London but changed his mind nine months ago 
and decided to try and win gold on home soil. He confirmed last night he
 would never fight again and was going out on a high.

‘It’s pretty amazing,’ he said of his win. ‘It probably hasn’t set in yet but it’s been a nervous day all round today.’

He
 fought and beat three opponents in the morning to earn his final. ‘The 
pressure is on right from the beginning of the day, my first-round 
opponent I got rid of pretty quickly,’ he said. ‘Most people might think
 that’s a good thing but actually it means you’ve not spent much time on
 the mat so you’re still nervous for the second one.

‘My
 second fight I wasn’t particularly good if I’m being honest, really 
struggled. And it was three fights in quite quick succession this 
morning because this weight category isn’t massively deep. Three matches
 in 90 minutes was tough.’

His
 overwhelming emotion, he insisted, was relief. ‘Later and tomorrow 
it’ll start to become a bit a pride and excitement but it’s relief at 
the moment,’ he said.

‘This
 doesn’t make up for London. I’ve worked my whole life to try and be 
Olympic champion and I fell short of it in both Olympic games I made.
