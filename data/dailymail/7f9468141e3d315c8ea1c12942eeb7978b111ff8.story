Ann Pollen has admitted killing her husband in a botched suicide pact after he was arrested over child sex offences in 2012

A vulnerable woman who admitted killing her domineering husband in a botched suicide pact has been told she will not go to jail.

Ann Pollen pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of husband Leonard after she was told by a judge at the Old Bailey she would be given a suspended sentence.

The court heard 'submissive' Ann agreed to the pact with her 58-year-old husband after he was arrested over an allegation of historic child sex abuse in 2012. 

The couple drew up a 'Last Will and Testament' explaining their decision before sending it to a relative on Friday August 30, 2012. 

The pair then swallowed pills, drank alcohol and slashed each other's 
wrists. When they both survived they attempted it again the next 
day.

In the document, Leonard wrote: 'I have decided to commit suicide and Ann has agreed to join me. By the time you get this we will be well dead.’

When the relative received the note on September 2 they informed police who forced entry into the house on September 3. They found Leonard had died but Ann was still alive.

Ann was later charged with murder and an alternative charge of manslaughter between August 29 and September 4, 2012.

She entered a guilty plea to manslaughter after the Crown decided not to pursue the murder charge and judge Peter Rook QC indicated she would receive a suspended sentence.

The judge said: ‘The prosecution now accept the defendant killed her husband as part of a suicide pact between them in which each intended to die.

‘The prosecution accept Anne Pollen had intended to die herself, however she survived.

‘In this case it is accepted that the deceased had a settled intention to kill himself and he was intent on committing suicide himself whether or not it was part of a suicide pact.

‘The idea of suicide is entirely that of the deceased. It is also accepted the deceased was the dominant partner. On the other hand the defendant was submissive and compliant with her husband’s wish.

‘She could not contemplate life on her own without her husband. She is likely to have had acute fears of abandonment.’

Sitting at the Old Bailey (pictured), judge Peter Rook QC said Ann would not be jailed for her part in the crime, which her defence barrister argued was 'almost beyond sensible imagination'

Prosecutor David Jeremy QC said: 'The Crown’s case is based on the defendant’s conversation with several individuals immediately following the discovery of her and the deceased.

'She slashed his wrists on the Friday night, and on the Saturday after the first attempt had not been successful.'

Pollen was 'subservient and suggestible' to her husband, he said.

Defending, Tim Moloney QC said: 'We say this is a truly exceptional case. We submit the circumstances are almost beyond sensible imagination.'

Pollen, of Hawthorn Road, Edmonton, north London, is on bail and will be sentenced tomorrow.

The court heard Mrs Pollen has had plastic surgery to the wounds on her wrist and is now receiving disability living allowance.

Judge Rook indicated that the sentencing range in this case was between 18 months and two years.

Investigating officer Detective Inspector Euan McKeeve, from the Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: ‘As a result of increased and strained pressures on their relationship, Leonard and Ann Pollen each took a life-changing decision to enter into a suicide pact with the settled intention of death.

‘It is accepted that they cut each other’s and their own wrists. In these fairly rare circumstances a homicide investigation is always undertaken to establish the facts.

‘I hope that Mr Pollen’s wider family can take some satisfaction that Ann Pollen has accepted responsibility for her role in his death.’
