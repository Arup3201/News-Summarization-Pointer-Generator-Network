A toddler who had more than 100 blood transfusions and a bone marrow transplant before her first birthday is back at home after an amazing recovery.

Ava Maye Riley-Maher, now 14 months, was diagnosed with a rare cancer-like disease – called Langerhan's Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) - aged just five months.

Ava had to undergo 15 weeks of aggressive chemotherapy and receive more than 100 blood transfusions in order to keep her body functioning.

But she failed to respond to the treatment and doctors said a bone marrow transplant would be her best hope of beating the disease.

Fortunately, a match was found - and her parents say they now wake up every day thankful that she is still alive.

Ava was released from the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital in June, two days before her first birthday, and is recovering at home in Manchester with mother Kirsty Riley, 24.

Her father, Jamie Maher, 28, has also been at her side throughout the ordeal.

Ava still has to be kept in semi-isolation and has to take more than 20 medicines a day - but her last transfusion was five weeks ago and her mother says she is hopeful her daughter will make a full recovery.

LCH affects just one in 250,000 children a year in the UK.

It is not technically a cancer, but it is cancer-like and can be treated with chemotherapy.

LCH is not technically a cancer, but it is cancer-like and can be treated with chemotherapy.

LCH
 occurs when the body accumulates too many Langerhan's cells - these are
 a type of white blood cell that normally help fight infection.

In
 LCH too many of these cells are produced and they build up in certain 
parts of the body where they can form tumours and damage organs.

The cause of the disease is unknown.

About 50 children in the UK develop LCH every year.

Symptoms
 include swollen lymph glands, poor appetite, bone pain, a skin rash, 
discharge from the ears, breathing difficulties and jaundice.

There is an 80 to 90 per cent survival rate.

The condition develops from cells in the skin. These cells are normally only found in the skin and airways but in LCH abnormal cells can be found in other parts of the body, including the bone marrow, liver, spleen and pituitary gland.

Ms Riley said: ‘As soon as you hear the word cancer you think “that’s it” and we couldn’t see any light at the end of the tunnel.

‘To see her undergoing all these treatments when she was so small was just heartbreaking, but we had to hope that she would get a donor.’

Ava spent eight weeks on the Anthony Nolan Bone Marrow donor register until a match was found.

Her parents do not know the donor’s identity other than that she is a 21-year-old woman from the UK, but they can contact her six months after the operation.

Ms Riley said: ‘The weeks leading up to the operation were probably the scariest part as we didn’t know whether it would come off or whether anything would go wrong.

‘It was only when I saw the bone marrow delivered to the theatre in a bag that I knew that it was her lifeline. But even then she could have gone either way after the transplant.

‘Looking at her now it’s hard to think about what might have happened. The doctors are amazed at how she’s recovered.

‘We wake up every day and are just thankful she’s here. When she walks out of the school gates with her friends I will remember how lucky we are.’
