Javier Hernandez will not be leaving Real Madrid in the January transfer window, according to the striker's agent.

The on-loan Manchester United forward has failed to hold down a regular place in Carlo Ancelotti's side, with much of that down to the superb form of Karim Benzema.

Therefore it has been mooted that the 26-year-old's season-long loan will be cut short earlier than expected, suggestions which have been rejected by Eduardo Hernandez.

The 26-year-old will not be returning to Manchester United in January despite reports in the press

He told AS: 'Sometimes the media speculate too much and assume situations. He (Hernandez) will not leave the club [in January].

'He is eager to play more minutes but he knows that hard work will open up more opportunities. He has his future ahead of him.

'Real Madrid are a team full of impressive players and obviously to earn a spot is difficult, but Javier has a great quality in working hard, like he has since the first day, and this is his quality.'

No decision will be made on Chicharito's long-term future until the end of the season, with Madrid undecided if they will exercise the option to sign the Mexican on a permanent basis. 

'If Madrid do not exercise the option to buy it will not be until the end of the season,' the agent added.

'In any case, we have to consult with the board of Manchester United to know what the future holds for Chicharito.'
