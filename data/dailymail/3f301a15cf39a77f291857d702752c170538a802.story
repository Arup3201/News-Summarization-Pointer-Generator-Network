'Modern Family' stars Jesse Tyler Ferguson and Eric Stonestreet recently relived some of their glory college days while visiting Kansas State University — and even crashed the tail-end of a wild fraternity bash.

Ferguson and Stonestreet, who play the couple Mitchell Pritchett and Cameron Tucker on the ABC sitcom, were on campus recently to give a talk to students when they decided to go bar hopping afterward.

At some point in the night, Stonestreet, who attended KSU, decided to visit his old fraternity house.

They knocked on the door of Pi Kappa Alpha about 2:30am and found the remains of a wild college party that left the place 'trashed.'

'This is exactly what I was expecting it to look like —  it's disgusting!' he said to the frat members, as he recounted it to Conan O'Brien on Wednesday. 

The on-screen couple went on a tour of the old house and found a picture of Stonestreet from his old fraternity days.

Then they decided to visit his old room — and Stonestreet opened the door without knocking.

'There was a man in there with his lady friend and they were under the sheets doing naughty, naughty things,' Ferguson told Conan. 

'We come into the room and ... she's covering herself up with the sheet. 

'And then she says: "Oh my God! Can we get a picture with you guys?"'
