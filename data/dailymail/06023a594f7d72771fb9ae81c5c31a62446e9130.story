They say you should dance like nobody is watching - a piece of advice this body popping U.S. motorcyclist appears to live by.

A hilarious video filmed by another motorist has caught the biker practising his body-popping dance moves while waiting for a red light.

Despite all the cars and spectators queued up around him, he shows no hesitation busting a few moves to a mystery song playing on his headphones.

In between bursts of laughter, he driver states: 'Look! The biker's pop locking.

'What is he doing? This is totally going on YouTube!

'What is he listening to? He must be listening to something. Everybody's looking at him, like: "What are you doing?"'
