The cost of Christmas dinner doesn’t have to put your festive budget in the red – because it’s possible to put a traditional spread on the table for as little as £2.73 a head.

Turkey and trimmings, a traditional pudding, cake and mince pies can all be bought for as little as £21.85 for a family of eight – as long as you shop around.

Experts at the Good Housekeeping Institute trawled the eight biggest food chains for their cheapest festive food – and found that Lidl had some of the best bargains.

The cheapest turkey was available at the German-owned chain – where it is £9.99 for a Braemoor self-basting bird of up to 4.8kg.

And for those who want to buy all the items on the menu in one shop, Lidl again was the best value option at £27.33, followed by Morrisons at £30.54 and Aldi at £31.70.

Lidl, like rival Aldi, is gaining rapid popularity by tapping into a fundamental shift in shopping  habits among the middle classes, which has been driven by the austerity of the past five years.

With many families deserting the more expensive supermarkets in search of ways to cut the weekly shopping bill, the firm is plotting an ambitious expansion drive that will see the number of stores more than double from 600 to 1,500.

In the survey, Lidl also had the cheapest sprouts, which were 99p for 1kg, while the brandy butter from the budget store and Aldi was a rock-bottom £1.49.

Potatoes were cheapest at Aldi, costing £1.38 for two bags of Maris Piper. Best value Christmas puddings came from the Morrisons M Savers range at £1.98 for two.

Its 400g Christmas cake, at two for £3, was also good value.

The cheapest mince pies came from Sainsbury’s at 63p for eight, while the store’s parsnips cost just £1 per kg.

Tesco was among the cheapest for stuffing mix and cranberry sauce, while Asda did well on cake and stuffing mix.

The cost of a budget Christmas dinner has risen since last year –but by just £1.73.

The increase from £20.12 is only 8.5 per cent, but it comes as the cost of living crisis continues to squeeze household spending.

The Institute’s experts tried to make a like-for-like comparison of the budget ranges of the eight stores in its survey.

The total basket price for the fourth cheapest grocer, Asda, was £33.12, with Tesco at £34.03, Iceland at £35.75, Sainsbury’s at £39.04 and the Co-op at £39.89.

Unsurprisingly, Waitrose was the most expensive at £53.15, while Marks & Spencer came in at £51.29. Both were almost double the Lidl figure of £27.33.

The Good Housekeeping Institute has been comparing prices for five years and says its figures help to cut through the hype and price-cutting claims made by the stores themselves.

Its consumer director, Caroline Bloor, said: ‘Every year our budget basket picks out the cheapest options for everything from turkey to mince pies across all the supermarkets and tells you where to go for a one-stop shop.

‘With the individual supermarkets claiming they’re the cheapest for Christmas dinner, we’re the ones comparing prices independently.’
