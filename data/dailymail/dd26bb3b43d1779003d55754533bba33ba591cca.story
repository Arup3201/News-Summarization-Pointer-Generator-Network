Sir Ian Andrews had blocked the release of the names as Soca is considering investigating allegations

The names of blue-chip firms which hired rogue private eyes are likely to remain secret despite the resignation of a senior police figure.

After the chairman of the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) stepped down on Thursday, hopes were raised that the controversial list of 102 companies and individuals that it had compiled could soon be revealed.

Sir Ian Andrews had blocked the release of the names as Soca is considering investigating allegations that the firms used private investigators who broke the law to obtain sensitive information. 

However, last night sources dashed any hopes that his decision to step down over a conflict of interest could soften the crime-fighting agency’s position on the list.

One said: ‘The very good reasons that it must not be made public remain exactly the same. Nothing has changed.’ 

Angry MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee, who have been given the list, are desperately hunting for a way to legitimately publish it without undermining any potential prosecutions. 

They believe the firms on it have escaped scrutiny for hiring dodgy private investigators who hacked, blagged and stole private data.

And they are suspicious of claims by Soca director general Trevor Pearce that the list may still be used in ‘live’ cases as it was compiled before 2008.

Last week Home Secretary Theresa May announced that the private investigation industry will be regulated

It is understood that Keith Bristow, who will lead the National Crime Agency when it takes over from Soca in October, is unlikely to overrule his predecessors.

The list of 102 companies was handed to the select committee on the condition it is kept in a locked safe on secure premises.

However, members have revealed the list is dominated by law firms, while others on it include debt collectors, oil companies, venture capitalists, pharmaceutical firms and two celebrities.

Yesterday, a jailed private investigator revealed that his biggest clients were insurers at Lloyd’s of London. John Spears, 73, a former Met detective, was one of four rogue snoopers whose customers form the basis of the secret list. 

He said that he was employed by three international law firms based in the City, which were in turn working for underwriters on the Lloyd’s market, and that he would regularly be asked to carry out ‘financial investigations’ to assess the value of individuals and companies.

Mr Pearce and others are due to answer further questions on the row next month when MPs return from their summer break.

Last week Home Secretary Theresa May announced that the private investigation industry will be regulated, and that operating without a licence will be punishable with a six-month jail term and a £5,000 fine.
