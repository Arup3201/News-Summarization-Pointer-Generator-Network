CURSE OF CARRINGTON

More worrying news from United’s training ground. Not only did Radamel Falcao pick up an injury there on Friday, Phil Jones and Ashley Young succumbed to the curse on Saturday. Falcao had a session of treatment on his thigh on Sunday morning but was subsequently declared unfit.

DO YOUR JOB

There will be much talk about the logic of Rafael da Silva marking the much taller Didier Drogba for Chelsea’s goal and rightly so. Robin van Persie would have cleared Drogba’s header, though, had been standing tight to the front post as he was supposed to be. Instead, the United striker got sucked towards the ball and that was all Drogba needed to give Chelsea the lead. Luckily for Van Persie, he was able to redeem itself.

FERGIE TIME

The United match programme was pushing sales of Sir Alex Ferguson’s reissued autobiography with what appeared to be little more than a free advert for the great man’s book. We await any reference by United to the recent autobiography published by former Old Trafford captain Roy Keane.

BEST MEMORIES

Still with the match programme, how about this for a piece of nostalgia from the George Best era? Writing a postcard to his parents from a United tour of Zurich in 1964, 17-year-old George tells them: 'The weather is brilliant, the food is not too good and the girls are fabulous.'

THIS CITY IS OURS

Manchester City fans like to taunt their neighbours by pointing to the number of United fans who actually live in London. Despite chaos on the west coast line from the capital on Sunday, though, Old Trafford was still pretty much full by kick-off.

DEADLY DIDIER

Drogba’s record against United is actually quite modest. Just four goals in 22 games. However he does score important goals against them, having previously won Chelsea an FA Cup final and scoring a goal here in April 2010 that effectively won Chelsea the title.

LINEKER HAS HIS SAY 

United showed impressive resilience to claim a late point, and their never-say-die attitude clearly made an impression on Gary Lineker, who tweeted after the match: ‘I don’t think Manchester United are a million miles away and will qualify for next season’s Champions League.’ 

The point keeps Louis van Gaal’s side in eighth position in the Premier League table. This time last season, United were also eighth, but with one more point (14).
