Swiss ski resorts are being forced to cut prices by up to 20 per cent in a desperate bid to lure back holidaymakers put off by the surge in the Swiss Franc which has sent prices spiralling.

The Swiss franc rose nearly 30 per cent to 0.81 against the euro last week following the Swiss National Bank's decision to remove a three-year-old cap of 1.20 francs per euro.

It means the cost of ski holiday essentials such as lift passes, ski hire as well as food and drink has rocketed for visitors in a country  already well known for its sky high prices.

The Swiss ski resort of Zermatt where local businesses are being pushed to cut prices to appeal to tourists following last week's surge in the value of the franc

In the plush resort of Zermatt for example the currency surge means a British visitor now has to pay £80 more for their week-long lift pass bringing the total to £380, while a single day pass went up by around £16 to £60.

Meanwhile the cost of enjoying just a small glass of beer while taking in the majestic view of the Matterhorn mountain jumped by around £1.30 to £4.60.

A glass coke rose by £1 to almost £4 and a burger and chips at a modest restaurant was up by almost £4 to £15.

In Portes du Soleil a skiing area which covers 13 resorts the lift operator has cut the cost of lift passes by 15 per cent.

However the Swiss Tourist board said the decision to cut prices was down to individual businesses and insisted they were waiting for the exchange rate to level out before taking any action.

The currency surge means a British visitor now has to pay around £80 more for their week-long lift pass in Zermatt bringing the total to £380, while a single day pass went up by around £16 to £60.

A spokesman said: 'Measures are being taken and everyone is looking at the situation but one week after the event is too early to make any decisions.

As a result of the currency surge holidaymakers who had booked in Switzerland have reportedly been racing to change their travel plans with many hoping to switch to Austria where they can pay in Euros.

Some speculators have even suggested that the currency surge could even spell the death knell for the Swiss Tourist Industry altogether. 

In a bid to keep the tourists arriving, the Zermatt tourist board reportedly sent an email to all 1,100 local businesses with advice ranging from reinstating the 1.20 franc per euro cap, offering discounts of 20 per cent or cutting prices by 10 per cent, according to Bloomberg News.

The Swiss franc rose nearly 30 percent against the euro after the Swiss National Bank's announcement that it would remove a three-year-old cap of 1.20 francs per euro

Other resorts are reportedly offering similar deals.

Rolf Sigg, who lives in the resort of Morgins  on the Swiss-French border for 30 years, told the Telegraph: 'We live and rely on winter tourism and since the Swiss central bank stopped the exchange rate cap we haven't really known what to think – everyone is doing their own thing, introducing special offers to ensure it doesn't become too expensive for tourists.

'Visitors shouldn't hesitate to ask for discounts because we are really having to sell ourselves now as well as offering the very best quality and service.'

Tourists from Europe accounted for 37 percent of overnight stays in 2013, according to latest data from the Swiss statistics office, but the country will be out of reach for many after 'SNB Day'.  

Last week Swiss hoteliers vented their fury on social media and politicians urged the Swiss to support the country's tourism industry, while resorts across the French border cheered a 'Godsend' as they looked forward to new Swiss clients.

‘Swiss people! Take your holidays in Switzerland!’ said Swiss tourist office chief Juerg Schmid on a twitter account.

In Gstaad, hotelier Thomas Frei tweeted: ‘Great, first rejections, wanting to know the euro rate and whether we can do a better rate. While I'm at it, does anyone want to buy my hotel?’

Tourism contributes three percent of Swiss GDP and hotels and restaurants employ five percent of the labour force.

The franc's abrupt surge comes weeks before European school half-term breaks which mark the height of the ski season

‘The original forecasts predicting growth once again in the Swiss tourism industry over the next two years probably won't stand up any more,’ Christoph Juen, CEO of the Swiss hotel association hotelleriesuisse, told Reuters.

That is an ‘existential threat’ to some hoteliers, he said.

‘I'm glad I'm just here for one day,’ said Amit Raj, 29 from Seville in Spain. ‘I'm definitely going to be a lot more cautious tonight and won't withdraw any more money,’ he added.

Even before the decision to allow the Franc to surge, Europe's economic woes had seen the number of German travellers to Switzerland drop 19 percent over five years to 1.9 million by 2013, according to the latest available German tourism association data.

In Alpine ski resorts, the economic chill has worsened in the past year as the number of Russian visitors fell sharply due to Moscow's standoff with the West over Ukraine and because of a weaker Russian rouble. Tourism from Japan has also been hit as the yen weakened.

An even bigger test for the mainly small businesses in the hotel and restaurant industry could come during the summer.

In the busiest summer months 2.5 million nights per month are booked by foreigners at Swiss hotels, 70 percent more than during the peak ski season, says Eurostat.
