Tesco caused outrage yesterday over plans to kill a pied wagtail which has been fluttering round one of its supermarkets - but backtracked when a BBC wildlife presenter intervened.

The seven inch tall female pied wagtail has 'delighted' customers by flying around the aisles since it fluttered into a Tesco Extra store in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk several weeks ago.

Staff have tried in vain to get it outside by laying down traps, using nets, opening windows and have even attempted to lure it out with food.

But the black and white bird has evaded all attempts to get it to leave and has defiantly stayed in the Norfolk shop.

Store bosses took the drastic step of seeking permission to have it shot over fears that it poses a health and safety risk. 

The conservation body Natural England granted a licence allowing Tesco to bring in a professional sniper to shoot and kill the small bird on the grounds of 'protecting public health'. 

But Tesco faced a storm of protest after a local newspaper revealed that the bird faced being gunned down.

Bernadette Tait, 28, of Gorleston near Great Yarmouth, who shops at the store, led a social media campaign on Twitter to save the bird.

She said: 'It made me very upset and I felt I needed to try and do something so I re-tweeted the story and tweeted as many people and companies as I could.

'I didn't want a riot outside Tesco but I felt that there was someone out there that had the skills to catch this bird without killing it. '

After she launched the campaign, BBC wildlife presenter Chris Packham, 53, who has presented nature programme Springwatch since 2009 then became involved and demanded that the bird be spared.

He tweeted a message to Tesco, saying: 'Can I ask you to rethink the shooting of the wagtail in Gt Yarmouth store please. I'm sure the bird could be caught.'

Tesco East Anglia replied in a tweet, saying: 'We've tried for a number of weeks to catch the bird, definitely our preference to catch and release. Any advice welcome.'

Customers and local residents also took to local newspaper websites to vent their anger at the decision.

Paul Gilham wrote: 'Pity you can't bring in marksmen/women to take out a few hundred seagulls instead of a rare beautiful bird like this. Shame on you tesco's!'

Another shopper said: 'We live in a rural area, the occasional bird dropping in or amongst our food is not that unusual. Just wash it off for goodness sake. But no, there's profit at stake here so a knuckle dragging ott response is deemed necessary. It's Asda for me and my family from now on.'

The bird is believed to be roosting around the store's café and is thought to be surviving on crumbs on the floor instead of its usual diet of insects. 

Pied wagtails are birds protected under the 1981 Wildlife and Countryside Act.

As a protected bird, anyone who kills one could be fined up to £5,000 or jailed for a maximum of six months if they do not have a licence. 

As the store is open for 24 hours a day, the bird was going to be shot on a Sunday when the store is closed between 10am and 4pm.

Mr Packham then put Tesco bosses in touch with experts from the British Trust of Ornithology(BTO), who said they hope to find a way to remove the bird alive.

Mr Packham said: 'Shame on Natural England. They should have put Tesco in touch with the BTO and not granted the licence in the first place.

'We must give Tesco due credit for doing the right thing. For those who say it is just a common bird and they are not in danger I say it is symbolic.

'It is one little bird, but it shows the value we put on our wildlife. If we say it doesn't matter about that one then where will we stop?

'We should not just reach for the gun. In this country we have a wealth of experts to go to before resorting to the gun.'

Following the intervention, Tesco East Anglia tweeted: 'Happy to liaise with @-BTO, we're going to explore other options over the next few weeks and will keep you updated.'

Packham responded on Twitter: 'All @Tesco are going to work with @-BTO to try again to catch the Wag' and the guns are stood down. Result and thank you all for lobbying.'  

Ms Tait, who started the campaign, said she was 'very pleased' that the apparent intervention of Chris Packham had led to the bird getting a reprieve.

She added: 'I've seen the bird playing and cleaning it's self on top of the freezers when doing my shopping and not once was I concerned about hygiene but thought how beautiful it was.

'My nine-year-old daughter is also pleased that there is hopefully a happy ending to this story.' 

A Tesco spokesman said: 'Our goal is always to release any birds which have found their way into our stores, while ensuring we maintain our high standards of hygiene.

'In spite of repeated efforts to free the bird including laying down traps, deploying nets and opening windows, we have been unsuccessful so far.

'We're going to continue to try to release the bird over the next few weeks.'

The Tesco spokesman was unable to say if other birds flying loose in stores had ever been shot.

A spokesman for Natural England said licences, such as the one granted to Tesco, were issued 'occasionally' but only when environment bosses were 'satisfied' all other methods had been exhausted.

The spokesman said: 'Fouling by birds can contaminate foods destined for human consumption, constituting a serious health risk.

'As such, licences are occasionally issued to remove birds to protect public health and safety, where those measures do not harm the conservation status of the species.

'Natural England must be satisfied all reasonable non-lethal methods - such as trapping and scaring - have been tried and proven ineffective before a licence to remove the bird is issued.'

The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said the loss of the bird would not affect the breed's population and it was not one of 'conservation concern'.

A spokesman for the bird charity added: 'In rare situations, when all non-lethal solutions have been fully explored, a license can be issued by Natural England to allow an individual or organisation to shoot a bird that is considered to be causing a significant nuisance. 

'In this case, the licence may have been issued in recognition of the health and safety risks caused by a bird in a major superstore. 

The female pied wagtail has so far resisted attempts to lure it out and is surviving on crumbs on the cafe floor

'Pied wagtails are not a species of conservation concern, and the small number of licenses granted for this purpose will not result in a significant population decline in the UK.

'We would always ask that an organisation takes measures to ensure that, where they pose a risk, birds don't enter their premises.

'In the unfortunate event that they do, it is essential that they make every effort to resolve the issue non-lethally before considering this type of action.'
