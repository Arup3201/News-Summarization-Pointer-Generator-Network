Two-month-old conjoined twins have passed away in their home after their parents made the agonizing decision not to risk separating them.

Andrew and Garrett Stancombe, who were born on April 10, had been receiving hospice care at their home in Indiana, Pennsylvania, about 45 miles north of Pittsburgh, before they died on June 24.

The boys, who were conjoined at the chest and shared a heart and a liver, were born to Michelle Van Horne and Kody Stancombe, who also have a 22-month-old son, Riley.

Van Horne told the Indiana Gazette that she had returned to work for the first time last Monday when she learned that the boys were struggling to breathe.

Missed: Conjoined twins Andrew and Garrett Stancombe have passed away 76 days after they were born

Stancombe and a nurse kept them comfortable and Michelle returned home, but the boys passed away the following day at 4am.

They contacted relatives before sharing the heartbreaking news on Facebook just after midnight.

'Our
 precious little boys have gone up to heaven,' Van Horne wrote. 'We 
thank everyone who followed every step with the boys and have shown 
their support.'

She added: 'We’re happy in
 knowing we had these special little boys with us. And 
now… they may be gone but in a way we know they’re not gone from us.'

Family: The couple had been overjoyed when the babies could return home after four days

The 
couple, who had been advised to have an abortion, had been overjoyed 
when the boys were able to return home with them just four days after 
their birth by C-section delivery.

Doctors had given them just a 25 per cent chance of living more than a day, but the baby boys battled on.

As
 the twins shared organs, their parents decided not to risk operating on
 them and accepted that it might mean the boys would eventually leave 
them.

'They’ll continue to fight until it’s 
their time,' Van Horne told WPXI. 'We will love them and cherish them until that moment and 
continue even after.'

In those early days, she was overjoyed to see them 'doing everything a normal infant would do. That's why 
we see them as our miracle babies'.

The babies battled on until their 76th day. Their funeral has been set for Thursday evening, following visitation at the Rairigh-Bence Funeral Home in Indiana.

According to the University of Maryland Medical Center, conjoined twins occur one in every 200,000 births, and their survival is anything but assured.

Approximately 60 per cent of conjoined twins arrive stillborn, and 
about 35 per cent survive only one day.

While surgery may be performed to 
separate them, it is risky depending upon where they are joined and 
whether they share internal organs, experts at the Mayo Clinic said.
