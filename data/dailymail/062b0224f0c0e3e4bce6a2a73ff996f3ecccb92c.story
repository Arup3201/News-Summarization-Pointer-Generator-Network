Nick Clegg faces a left-wing revolt from Liberal Democrat members demanding he form a coalition with Labour after the next election.

The Deputy Prime Minister is preparing defy his grassroots to refuse  to campaign in 2015 on a promise to scrap £9,000 tuition fees.

But as new figures showed Lib Dem membership has slumped by a third in three years, a survey of activists revealed most would prefer to see Labour’s Ed Miliband installed as Prime Minister next time round.

Choice: Lib Dem members overwhelmingly prefer the idea of Labour returning to power after the 2015 election

A survey of members by Lib Dem voice shows 40 per cent want to their party to form a full coalition with Labour after the 2015 general election, compared to just 13 per cent who want a repeat of the power-sharing deal with David Cameron’s Tories.

A further 15 per cent would like a ‘confidence and supply’ agreement with Labour, which would stop short of a coalition and leave the Lib Dems free to vote on an issue-by-issue basis, but agree not to bring down the government or vote against its Budget.

It means more than half (55 per cent) 
of Lib Dem members want to see some form of arrangement with Labour 
compared to fewer than 1 in 5 (18 per cent) who want to return to power 
with the Tories.

Labour's income in 2012 was around £2.75million more than that of the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats combined.

Ed Miliband's party had a total income of just over £33million and spent around £30.2 million.

It compared to an income of £24.2 million and expenditure of £23.3 million for David Cameron's Tories.

Meanwhile, Nick Clegg's Liberal Democrats took in just over £6 million and spent more than £6.4 million

However the accounts, released by the Electoral Commission, also Labour's membership also dropped, from 193,961 in 2010 and 193,300 in 2011 to 187,537 last year.

Labour's income was up from £31.2 million in 2011 and Conservative funds also rose from £23.7 million, while Lib Dems saw a small fall from £6.2 million.

Both the Scottish National Party and the UK Independence Party bucked the trend of falling membership figures.

The SNP saw membership soar from 16,232 in 2010 to 24,732 in 2012, on the back of the party's capture of overall control in Holyrood, while Nigel Farage's UKIP has grown from 15,535 in 2010 to 20,409 last year.

Meanwhile, membership of the far-right British National Party continued to tumble, from 14,046 in 2010 to 7,651 in 2011 and just 4,872 in 2012.

The SNP had an income of £2.3 million in 2012, UKIP £1.2 million and the BNP £462,450.

Stephen 
Tall, editor of LibDemVoice, said: ‘Tactically, it makes sense for the
Lib Dems to want to choose Labour next time: it would show the party 
isn’t simply an adjunct to the Tories but can work with both other major
parties if that’s how the public votes.

‘On a principled basis, Labour’s position on a range of big economic issues - tax-cuts for the low-paid, the ‘mansion tax’, ending universal benefits for wealthier pensioners - has moved towards the Lib Dems’ in recent months.’

Latest data from the Electoral Commission showed the Liberal Democrats took in just over £6 million in donations in 2012, and spent more than £6.4 million.

The accounts also showed revealed a steep decline in membership for the Liberal Democrats, down from 65,038 in 2010 to 48,934 in 2011 and 42,501 last year.

The stage is set for another stand-off
between Mr Clegg and his members at the party’s annual conference in 
Glasgow in September.

The 
party leader intends to go into the general election with an explicit 
pledge to keep annual university tuition fees of £9,000.

Lib
Dems will be asked to back the plans to retain the controversial fees, a
move which would allow it to become a manifesto promise.

The
fallout of the row over tuition fees has hung over the party since it 
fought the 2010 election opposing increases before swiftly agreeing to 
introduce significantly higher costs.

Mr Clegg later apologised for breaking the pledge in a video that was quickly spoofed and went viral on the web.

Last
month, he told party members that the 2015 manifesto will make a clear 
distinction between ‘commitments' and 'ambitions' and will also spell 
out the party's red lines for any coalition negotiations.

Policy papers have been drawn up by 
the Lib Dem higher education working group, led by Baroness Sal Brinton,
which dismiss calls to reduce the fees to £6,000 or replace them with a
graduate tax.

It recommends
retaining the £9,000 limit with a new government then reviewing the 
policy. Party sources said that work would focus on how effective the 
policy had been.

Under Lib Dem rules, proposals must be backed at its conference to become party policy.

A spokesman said: ‘This will be debated at conference.’

Not again: Only 13 per cent of Lib Dem members surveyed by LibDemVoice want to see a repeat of the coalition with the Conservatives

A senior Lib Dem source told The Independent:  ‘We know that we must not go into the next election making unrealistic promises that we won't be able to keep.

‘Everyone from grass-roots activists to Government ministers has taken flak on this and we all emerged from that experience bruised, so we are determined not to repeat the mistake.

‘That experience has taught us all the importance of realistic, costed policies that we can be confident could be delivered in government.

‘That's why we have thoroughly examined the current system and the alternatives and have concluded that we should stick with the current system and review it once it has been given a proper chance to bed in.’
