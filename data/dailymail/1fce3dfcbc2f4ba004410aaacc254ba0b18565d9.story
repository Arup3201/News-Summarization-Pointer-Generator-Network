President Obama is set to launch an all-out assault on Mitt Romney in Tuesday night's debate, including attacks on the republican's time at Bain Capital.

He is desperate to pick up momentum and improve poll ratings after his first lackluster first debate when his Republican rival appeared more forceful, energetic and engaging than the President.

And his campaign spokeswoman has hinted that Obama will use Mr Romney's track record as an investment capitalist to hurt him.

'Governor Romney has been making pitches all of his life,' Jennifer Psaki said.

'He
knows how to say what people want to hear whether that was during his 
time at Bain or during the dozens of town halls he did during the 
primary,' she added, referring to the private equity firm that Romney 
used to run.

Talking to the people: President Obama stopped in to his campaign office in Williamsburg, Virginia on Sunday since he was nearby studying for the upcoming debate

Support: Mr Obama's advisers said that he was planning on appearing more energetic during Tuesday's upcoming debate

Not once during the first debate in 
Denver did the President mention Romney's time at Bain, even though he 
and his campaign have frequently attacked the work throughout the 
campaign.

A similar hint came from senior Obama campaign advisor David Axelrod, who gave a clear hint that Romney's business experience may be used as a double-edged sword.

'We expect Governor Romney will have a great debate too,' Axelrod said during an appearance on Fox News Sunday.

'He is a great salesman. That is what he did as a professional, he is very good at it.'

He said that President Obama was definitely going to be 'aggressive in making the case for his view of where we should go as a country.'

After being roundly criticized for his performance in the last debate, Mr Obama is apparently well aware that a change needs to be made.

Down to business: Romney, seen with his wife Ann, spent the weekend in their Massachusetts home preparing for the debate Tuesday night

'He knew when he walked off that stage (of the first debate), and he also knew as he watched the tape of that debate, that he has to be more energetic,' campaign adviser Robert Gibbs said to CNN's State of the Union.

Both Obama and Romney are skipping campaigning Sunday to focus
on preparing for their debate Tuesday night, with the incumbent trying 
to rebound from a widely panned performance at the first face-off and 
the Republican nominee hoping to repeat his strong showing.

Senator Rob Portman, who has been playing the role of the President during Romney's debate prep, said that they are taking a shift in energy levels into account.

'I think President Obama is going to come out swinging,' Portman told ABC's This Week.

'He's going to compensate for a poor first debate. And I think that will be consistent with what they've been doing this whole campaign, which is running a highly negative ad campaign. They've spent hundreds of millions around the country, including a lot in Ohio, mischaracterizing Governor Romney's positions and misrepresenting him. I think you'll see that again on Tuesday night.'

The president was gathering with 
advisers at a riverfront resort in Williamsburg while Romney was 
sticking to his Boston-area home ahead of the prime-time town-hall style
debate at Hoftsra University exactly three weeks before the November 6 
election.

After a listless 
first debate October 3, Obama was working with aides on more pointed and
aggressive responses to his Republican rival in the tight race.

The
Obama campaign also wants to go after the former Massachusetts governor
and businessman for what it sees as his willingness to shift positions 
to make them more palatable for voters.

Romney will be ready for a more aggressive Obama, adviser Ed Gillespie said.

'The president can change his style, 
he can change his tactics, he can't change his record and he can't 
change his policies. And that's what this election is about,' Gillespie 
told CNN's State of the Union.

Romney's
campaign released a new television advertisement using footage from 
running mate Paul Ryan's debate last week with Vice President Joe Biden.

Round one: Romney was deemed the winner of the first debate as the President was criticized for being too quiet and seemingly uninterested

Sparring: Thursday saw the first and only vice presidential debate between Romney's running mate Paul Ryan (left) and Vice President Joe Biden (right)

The ad features clips of Ryan saying 
the government 'can't keep spending money we don't have.' His comments 
are juxtaposed with video from the debate of Biden laughing.

The campaign did not say in which states the ad would run.

Obama aides have tried to make debate preparations a higher priority for the president this time.

Ahead
of first debate, some of Obama's practice sessions were cut short, and 
others were canceled, mainly because of developments in Libya, where 
four Americans were killed at a U.S. consulate.

Aides
say Obama is still dealing with those matters and others. But the 
urgency that led to interruptions during earlier debate preparations has
subsided, and the campaign is trying to ensure that Obama stays more 
fully engaged in his practice sessions.

Despite questions about the effectiveness of his debate preparation, Obama is working with the same team this time around. Advisers David Axelrod and David Plouffe, along with former White House officials Anita Dunn and Ron Klain, are running the preparations. Deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes has been added to the team because the second and third debates involve foreign policy.

Senator John Kerry is playing the role of Romney.

One of the priorities during the practice sessions is sharpening the president's retorts to Romney and drawing a sharper contrast between what the campaign says are Romney's shifting positions on key issues.

Greeting the fans: President Obama's decision to take days off from campaigning shows how serious he intends to focus on preparation for the second debate

The president may have picked up a few pointers from Biden.

Obama watched Thursday's debate with aides in a conference room on Air Force One as he traveled back to Washington. The president said little throughout the debate, but did chime in when Biden would deliver a particularly pointed counter to Ryan.

Romney returned to Massachusetts on Saturday night after campaigning in Ohio. He planned to spend most of his two days at home in Belmont getting ready for the debate.

With Romney is Ohio Senator Rob Portman, who's playing Obama in mock debates.
