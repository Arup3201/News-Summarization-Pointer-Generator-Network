By its very nature as the lowest professional division in the country, the goings on in League Two are all too often an afterthought in the frantic world of English football.

But at the bottom of the Football League you will find the very essence of our game.

League Two in the past housed seasoned veterans and long-ball football, but now it is the home of some of the best young talent in the country, forced to try and forge a career from the bottom up due to the influx of foreign talent in the top flight.

Clubs like Hartlepool United, Plymouth Argyle and Exeter City have set a new and encouraging trend of focusing on development rather than recruitment.

What the FA implore the big clubs to do is already being done in League Two. Twelve of Exeter's squad of 20 have come through their academy, eight of Hartlepool's squad of 19, and seven of Plymouth's squad of 22.

Refreshingly too, financial gulfs are nowhere near as wide in League Two than they are higher up the pyramid, creating a level playing field and a truly unpredictable league.

Bristol Rovers were surprisingly relegated last season alongside Torquay, while the quartet of Carlisle, Tranmere, Shrewsbury and Stevenage who have come down from League One will find no easy games.

On the flip side, Luton and Cambridge, promoted from the Conference, can take solace in the fact that no side has gone straight back down from the Conference since its inception. A remarkable statistic.

So you get the picture then - what League
 Two lacks in prestige it makes up for in its fluid, combustible and 
refreshingly English nature.

Squad overhauls are far more commonplace, with the vast majority of transfers being signed for free on one-year deals - Shrewsbury have been the busiest of the lot so far, with 16 players coming in.

That being said, managerial changes are less frequent in League Two than in the leagues above.

Only three clubs changed managers in the summer, with Michael Appleton coming in at Oxford, Rob Edwards at Tranmere and Micky Mellon at Shrewsbury.

League Two also houses the second-longest serving manager in the country. Paul Tisdale's eight years at Exeter is bettered only by Arsene Wenger's near-18-year stay at Arsenal.

Tisdale and the rest of the league will be back in action this weekend when the season kicks off at 3pm on Saturday.

The favourites

Bury and Portsmouth finished last season strongly after changing managers and, having both recruited well, look capable of automatic promotion.

Bury boss David Flitcroft managed to persuade prolific veteran striker Ryan Lowe to come back to Gigg Lane, while goalkeeper Shwan Jalal, midfielder Tom Soares and winger Kelvin Etuhu have impressed at higher levels in past seasons.

Andy Awford was given the Portsmouth job full-time at the end of last season after remaining unbeaten during his caretaker spell, when Pompey won five of their final seven games to avoid relegation.

That has given the former Pompey captain a mandate to manouevre in the transfer market and he has added the experience of goalkeeper Paul Jones, left back Nicky Shorey and Danny Hollands to a squad full of young talent from their academy.

Oxford could also be in the automatic promotion shake-up, with a hungry Michael Appleton eager to prove his managerial credentials after a frustrating start to his career.

Appleton's first three jobs were all in difficult environments at Portsmouth, Blackpool and Blackburn, so he will appreciate being in relatively serene surroundings, even though he has had to drop into the fourth tier.

All four relegated sides will be expecting promotion challenges, but that may be a bridge too far for a Stevenage side who have been going backwards for the entirety of Graham Westley's third spell in charge.

Like Stevenage, Carlisle stuck with their manager despite relegation. Graham Kavanagh will be under immediate pressure to challenge at the top, but he has the squad to do so.

Likewise, Tranmere have not been weakened too much by relegation and have a side that hould be in the automatic promotion race right to the end.

Shrewsbury's reaction to relegation was in stark contrast to that of their rivals, with a new manager and 16 players coming in.

Micky Mellon needs to get his squad gelled quickly, but he will be hungry for success in League Two having been harshly sacked by Fleetwood shortly after leading them to the Football League two years ago.

The signing of former Stoke and Sunderland wideman Liam Lawrence could prove to be an inspired piece of business by Mellon and Shrewsbury.

Dark horses

Such is the nature of League Two, all 24 sides know that promotion is not beyond their reach, even if they are not expecting it or planning for it.

Burton Albion were the losing play-off finalists in May, and while their squad will have been hit hard by that defeat it has been strengthened over the summer. They have a top young manager in Gary Rowett who will be confident of a third successive top-seven finish.

As a big-name club for this level, Luton's odds for promotion are artificially short, but back-to-back promotions from the Conference to League One have been achieved in recent history by Crawley and Stevenage.

The loss of striker Andre Gray to Brentford will be hard-felt though and they may take a mid-table finish.

York and Southend, losing play-off semi-finalists in May, will in the hunt for the top seven again and could be challenged by a cluster of improving sides from last season's also-rans, such as Wimbledon, Hartlepool, Exeter and Plymouth.

Relegation battle

The stats prove that this is traditionally the tightest relegation scrap in all four of England's professional leagues.

With little to choose between all 24 clubs in terms of financial clout, and with the fact that only two teams go down, there often arises a scenario like last season, when Bristol Rovers were relegated on the last day despite being just nine points adrift the top half of the table.

The team that escaped that day, Wycombe, could well find themselves in another relegation battle after a difficult summer in the transfer market for manager Gareth Ainsworth.

Cambridge have a very inexperienced side and unless they address that they could become the first side to be relegated back to the Conference the season after promotion.

If Cambridge and Wycombe are to stay up they will be looking to finish above the likes of Morecambe and Newport, who finished last season poorly.

Bury 6/4, Portsmouth 13/8, Luton 15/8, Shrewsbury 11/5, Northampton 7/2, Burton Albion 7/2, Plymouth 4/1, York 4/1, Carlisle 9/2, Southend 9/2, Stevenage 9/2, AFC Wimbledon 11/2, Oxford Utd 11/2, Newport 6/1, Tranmere 6/1, Cambridge 7/1, Cheltenham 8/1, Hartlepool 8/1, Mansfield 8/1, Dag & Red 9/1, Accrington Stanley 11/1, Morecambe 14/1, Wycombe 14/1, Exeter 18/1
