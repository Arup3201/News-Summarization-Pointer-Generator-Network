Spared jail: Gianna Registe, 21, walked free from court today after carrying out a £2,500 Boots loyalty card scam - and blowing the lot on make-up

A 21-year-old model walked free from court today after she carried out a £2,500 loyalty card scam while working for Boots - and blew the lot on make-up.

Gianna Registe amassed 25,000 points on her Boots Advantage Card as she worked as an optical assistant at the chemist’s flagship store in Oxford Street, central London.

She credited the card with fake sales and rewards by introducing people for eye tests  - before spending it all on make-up.

'She spent the £2,500 on cosmetics and other toiletry items,' Peter Zinner, prosecuting, told Southwark Crown Court.

Now, Registe, who is listed as a commercial/alternative model for Fusion Management, has been sentenced to four months in prison, suspended for two years.

Registe’s four-month scam was discovered after her suspicious bosses at Boots launched an investigation last year, the court heard.

She has since found a new job as an 
optical assistant for high street chain Specsavers - but has so far 
failed to inform her new employers about the fraud. 

Wearing a smart black trouser suit with a designer Louis 
Vuitton bag hanging off her arm, Registe was stony-faced as she was 
sentenced today.

Sentencing the model, Judge David Higgins told her: ‘Briefly, as an employee at Boots, you used a staff loyalty card to acquire points to the value of £2,500.

‘In one way or another you used them all. This amounted to a gross, sustained and relatively sophisticated breach of trust over a period of three to four months.

‘Your criminal wrongdoing became routine and your behaviour was deeply deplorable and antisocial.

Make-up spree: 'She then spent the £2,500 on cosmetics and other toiletry items,' said prosecutor Peter Zinner

‘If you choose to behave in this way you
 must accept the consequences, which the courts have made clear are 
likely to be severe.’

However, the judge added that he had been persuaded that Registe's remorse was sincere. 

Julia Smart, defending, told the court Registe was ‘hard working’ and had raised hundreds of pounds for good causes - including £300 by shaving her head. 

She has also volunteered for 
disadvantaged children in Hackney, east London, and has run the Race For
 Life to raise cash for Cancer Research and Macmillan Cancer Research, 
he said.

‘From the moment the fraud was 
discovered by Boots she has never sought to deflect blame from herself 
or excuse her conduct in any way at all,' said Mr Smart.

‘It is with great sadness and shame that she finds herself before here today. In every other respect she is a role model for young women.'

Registe, from Manor Park, east London, admitted a single count of making or adapting articles for use in fraud.

She was ordered to complete 50 hours' unpaid work within a year and must repay Boots £2,500 in compensation, as well as an £80 victim surcharge.
