Two pit bulls broke through a fence in a Nevada community, entered a neighbor's home through a dog door and killed three dogs inside while the residents were away, animal control officers said.

Jennifer, a resident of the home in the Reno suburb of Spanish Springs returned Friday to find Jill, a black lab, Gucci, a shih tzu, and Buddy a Pekingese dead inside inside the house on Reiger Springs Drive.

The dogs were seized and their owner is facing a citation, said Barry Brode, director of Washoe County Animal Services. The pit bulls could be euthanized if a judge orders it.

Jill, a black lab, was mauled to death by pit bulls on Friday

Gucci the shih tzu was found dead by its owner on Friday after being brutally attacked by two pit bulls

Buddy the Pekingese was also killed in the bloody pit bull attack on Friday along with two other dogs

'(It was) an accident that could have been prevented ... by making sure the (pit bulls) were secured in the kennel, that the fence line was properly secured and up to date,' Brode told KTVN-TV

'Two pit bulls who I have never seen before were hovering over our dead family dog,' said Jennifer, the owner who only wanted to give her first name.

'As I proceeded further into the home, which was all covered in blood, I found our other two dogs, and all of them were dead,' said Jennifer.

Dog doors can be secured so animals can't sneak in from the outside, he added. Dog doors are small portals in a wall or door that allow pets to enter and exit a house on their own.

'The dogs entered through a dog door, an unsecured dog door,' said Barry Brode, Director of Washoe County Animal Services.

Neighbors said the pit bulls had broken loose before, but they had managed to get the dogs out of their home without incident.

'The pit bulls last summer were breaking into our yard, and they were very friendly and came into my house (to) hang out with my dogs,' Rorie Monroe said.

The owner of the three dead dogs wouldn't provide a full name to the TV station.

'That dog door,' said Jennifer. 'I mean I would worry about burglars, but not my dogs being eaten in their home.'

Jennifer's dogs blood was left splattered all over her home in Spanish Springs
