It looks like she's letting out a mighty roar - but a lack of teeth makes her look more cute than fierce.

This six-day-old lion cub named Ying Yai, which translates as ‘Elder Princess’, was pictured in a zoo in Thailand closing her eyes and looking to the sky as she yawned in bright sunlight.

Ashley Vincent, 48, who lives in the country after he moved there from London, took the photos from just a few feet away as he lay on the ground at Khao Kheow Open Zoo in Chonburi province.

Sisters: Another photo shows Ying Yai and Ying Klang accidently clashing heads at the age of 14 days, because they were still a little unsteady on their feet

Ying Yai was born at the zoo with her sisters Ying Klang, which translates as 'Middle Princess', and Ying Lek, which means 'Little Princess'.

Mr Vincent, who watched the cubs growing up for five months, said: ‘At six days old the cubs were teething. Occasionally they would wince and give out a little cry.

‘Laying on the ground I was able to catch the fully extended jaws of Ying Yai exposing her teeth they were just beginning to show through. I called the photo “Roaring Practice” for the fun of it.’

'It wasn't uncommon to see them bumping into things and each other'

Mr Vincent added: ‘At 14 days old the cubs were still a little unsteady on their young legs.

'They appeared to still be learning to adjust the focus of their eyes, so it wasn't uncommon to see them bumping into things and each other.

‘They would invariably try to circle around with a view to pouncing on me from behind. I never felt seriously threatened or in any actual danger.

Growing up: Ying Yai, who is pictured at five months old. Mr Vincent stopped photographing the cubs in the open when they were aged five months because they were 'too big and boisterous' to cope with

‘But by five months of age they have some weight and size to reckon with, not to mention their teeth and claws.

'They are more than capable of piercing skin and I keep in mind these lovely cubs are still wild at heart.

‘Thinking about how quickly they grow, those kind of thoughts can quickly find a chill running down one's spine in this sort of situation.’

Mr Vincent stopped photographing the cubs in the open when they were aged five months because they were ‘too big and boisterous’ to cope with, and began to ‘show signs of their predatory nature’.
