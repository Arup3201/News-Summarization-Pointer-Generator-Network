A prominent US think tank has published a piece arguing that Tony Abbott is the most incompetent leader of an industrialised democracy and has 'proven so incapable' that he has to go.

The piece was published on the Council on Foreign Relations website before the prime minister survived a leadership spill motion on Monday.

It argues that in his two years as prime minister, Mr Abbott has proven 'shockingly incompetent', which explains why other Liberal party members may now scheme to unseat him.

A leading United States think tank has published a piece arguing that Tony Abbott is the most incompetent leader of an industrialised democracy and has 'proven so incapable' that he has to go

'Abbott has proven so incapable of clear policy thinking, so unwilling to consult with even his own ministers and advisers, and so poor at communicating that he has to go,' CFR senior fellow Joshua Kurlantzick wrote.

'Abbott's policies have been all over the map, and the lack of coherence has often made the prime minister seem ill-informed and incapable of understanding complex policy issues. 

'In press conferences, Abbott has offered mixed public messages about some of the health care reforms that were at the center of his agenda, and sometimes has seemed unsure himself of what health legislation has actually been passed on his watch.'

CFR is a respected Washington DC-based think-tank that is generally considered not to be aligned with either conservative or liberal politics. Mr Kurlantzick is listed as an expert on South East Asia, China, public diplomacy and democratisation in the developing world.

He  also referenced recent government funding cuts to the ABC as a sign of Mr Abbott's 'incompetence'.

Author Joshua Kurlantzick, a US specialist in south-east Asian politics, argued Tony Abbott had poor policy thinking and a lack of communication

'He also has seemed unsure of what he promised in the past regarding Australia's major public broadcaster – he promised not to touch it – before he went ahead and made cuts to it,' he wrote.

The piece suggested Mr Abbott appeared to have one of the worst senses of public relations of any prime minister in recent Australian history.

Mr Kurlantzick argued Mr Abbott's 'coarse rhetoric' had embarrassed Australia at major economic summits and he looked 'completely baffled' on climate changes issues at the G20 summit in Brisbane last year.

The prime minister's recent decision to hand Prince Philip an Australian knighthood was described by Mr Kurlantzick as a 'bizarre choice'.

'I take no position on whether a left or right coalition can govern Australia better – whether Australia needs a revolt from within the ruling coalition or a national election victory by the left,' he wrote. 

'But a country that for decades has punched above its weight on nearly every international issue surely can do much better for a Prime Minister than Tony Abbott.'
