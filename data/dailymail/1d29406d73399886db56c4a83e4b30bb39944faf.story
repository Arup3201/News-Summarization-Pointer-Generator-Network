Ipswich Town defender Tyrone Mings is one of the most sought-after talents in English football, but that wasn't always the case.

Mings came through the academy at Southampton but in 2009 the south coast club released the then-5ft 8in Mings because they thought he was too small.

But on Wednesday night Mings, now 6ft 5in, came face-to-face with his former club as Ipswich lost 1-0 to Southampton in the FA Cup.

Saints were forced to make difficult decisions back in 2009 when their academy budget was slashed, and Mings was considered surplus to requirements. 

But just five years later and the 21-year-old has been one of the stand-out performers in the Championship with Premier League giants Arsenal among the clubs hot on his trail. 

Mings joined Bristol Rovers for in 2009 before moving to Yate Town, Chippenham Town, and finally Ipswich - where he has excelled under Mick McCarthy. 

Although McCarthy insisted Mings would not be sold in January, it seems only a matter of time before he's plying his trade at one of the country's biggest clubs.

Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger confirmed his interest in signing Ipswich's Mings in early December
