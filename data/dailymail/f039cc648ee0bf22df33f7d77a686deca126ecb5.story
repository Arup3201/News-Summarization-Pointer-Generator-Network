Former NFL star Fred Smoot was arrested and charged with domestic assault after allegedly beating up his girlfriend this weekend.

Police were called to Smoot's house on Sunday morning, where his girlfriend claimed the former Washington Redskins cornerback pushed her against the wall in their bathroom when she tried to grab the keys to his truck so she could drive it to work, seriously injuring her.

She later stated that she believed he wanted to prevent her from seeing the boxes of condoms and sheets of generic Viagra he had in the vehicle.

Victim: Smoot's girlfriend (above) claims he hit and scratched her because she wanted to use his truck

Real reason: She believes he did not want her to see the generic Viagra and condoms he had in his car

According to a report obtain by TMZ, she also claimed that Smoot scratched her on the knuckle and stomach.

The girlfriend claims she then ran to a neighbor's to get help, but no one was home.

She ultimately hid in a closet until police arrived. 

Smoot was eventually released on bail after being booked on misdemeanor domestic simple assault, with the NFL saying they would not make a statement. 

Hurt up: She also began sharing photos she claimed were from previous fights with Smoot

In this instance, Smoot grabbed her arms so hard she alleges he left marks

His girlfriend meanwhile began posting photos of what she claims were the results of past physical altercations, showing her neck reddened and sore, cuts on her hands, arms and neck, and even a bloody mouth. 

Another photo shows the emergency protective order she took out against Smoot, who has yet to comment on the incident.

This is not Smoot's first brush with the law, as the footballer was caught up in a scandal when he played for the Minnesota Vikings back in 2006.

Smoot and some fellow players were alleged to have chartered a boat to party with prostitutes in what became known as the Love Boat Scandal.

Getting out: She also shared the emergency protective order she filed

At one point someone claimed he used a double-headed dildo on two of the women in front of the boat's crew. 

He was ultimately fined by the Vikings for his alleged actions and for being the ringleader behind the outing.

He has never confirmed or denied any of these reports.
