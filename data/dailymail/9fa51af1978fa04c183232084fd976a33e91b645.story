A teenage ballet dancer was fighting for his life today - and feared paralysed from the neck down - after being mugged in a street attack.

Talented Jack Widdowson, 19, suffered a suspected broken neck in the brutal late-night assault.

His family at his hospital bedside have been told that Jack may never dance again after the attack in which his iPhone was taken.

Talented: Ballet dancer Jack Widdowson, 19, is fighting for his life after being mugged in Cardiff. A member of a ballet company in Bern, Switzerland, he was visiting his student brother in Cardiff when he was attacked walking home from a night out

Jack, a member of a ballet company 
in Bern, Switzerland, was visiting his student brother in Cardiff when 
he was attacked walking home from a night out.

He was in the city's docks area when it’s believed his attacker ‘befriended him’ - and showed him a short cut alongside a canal.

Police say Jack was attacked moments later by the same man on the canal towpath.

Other late-night revellers found him unconscious more than an hour later and dialled 999.

Detective Chief Inspector Andy Davies,
of South Wales Police, said: 'This is an appalling assault while 
Jack was out with his brother.

'They became separated when he was 
walking home when he was joined by an unknown man.

'He was attacked and 
his iPhone was stolen and is still missing'

Jack was yesterday in a critical condition at the University Hospital of Wales with his family at his bedside.

His father Dr Julian Widdowson is head of sports medicine at Premiership rugby club Bath.

A family friend said: ‘Jack is a lovely and gentle young man - we are praying he is going to pull through.’

Jack's family, including his parents Julian and Celia, his sister and two brothers, are at his bedside. His brother Mark, 21, is a student in Cardiff and had been a semi-professional rugby player in France.

Detective Inspector Shane Ahmed said: ‘This incident is appalling and a full investigation is under way to catch the person responsible.

‘Our thoughts are with the family of the victim, who are being supported by a trained family liaison officer at this difficult time.

‘Although the assault happened during the early hours of the morning, there may have been a number of people out, on their way to or from Cardiff city centre.

‘We're appealing for anyone with information to come forward.’

Police want to speak to a man described as of mixed race and wearing a white-striped polo shirt with a dark-coloured motif on the left breast, blue jeans and white trainers.

Inspector Ahmed added: ‘I'm urging anyone who may have witnessed the pair walking in the early hours of Saturday morning.

‘We also want to hear from anyone who spoke to someone matching the description of this man in the nearby area, to contact us immediately.’

Jack, of Farmborough, near Bath, Somerset, started dancing in his early teens and later graduated from Tring Park School for the Performing Arts in Hertfordshire.

He went on to perform with London-based contemporary ballet the AD Dance Company and later became an apprentice dancer at Bern Ballet in Switzerland.

Jack had flown back to Britain from Switzerland after making a successful premier in the lead role of his ballet company the night before.

His doctor father came back with him after his show success and said yesterday: 'We were so proud to see him the day before the attack.

'He left school in August and was thrilled to have been chosen as one of the youngest ever members of Bern Ballet Dance Company where he had the privilege to dance one of the lead roles in the company's winter production.'

Dr Widdowson said the family had messages of support and good wishes from across the world.

He said: 'This is a huge comfort to Jack and all the family as he fights for his life.

'We are all appalled by this unprovoked mindless violent attack in this great city where I was born.

'We continue to be by Jack's bedside hoping and praying for recovery.'

Dr Widdowson said his son was a 'determined and strong-willed boy' who had worked hard to make the best of his natural talents.

He said: 'Jack is a very entertaining person who is very well loved by all who know and work with him. He has a polite and easy manner with a great sense of humour.

'Jack has always been a good sportsman and represented his school hockey and rugby where he played prop.

'Jack has always been physically, mentally and emotionally strong which enabled him to pursue a career in dance.

'It also helped to survive a near-fatal episode of bacterial meningitis three years ago, then make a complete recovery, persevering with a punishing programme of rehab exercises.'

Jack left Tring Park School in June after studying science A-levels and a vocational course in dance. He was school prizes for contemporary dance and choreography.

Dr Widdowson added: "We would like to thank the member of the public who found him and made the 999 call. We would also like to thank all the dedicated professionals involved in his care." 

In 2008 his father noticed he had a chest rash at home and immediately diagnosed meningitis.

In an interview earlier this year Dr Widdowson said: ‘Jack had been at a party the night before.

‘At first, when Jack said he felt ill in the morning I just thought maybe he had overindulged at the party and told him to take a couple of paracetamol.

‘His brother Mark was home so I told him to keep an eye on him.

‘Mark then rang to say Jack was talking nonsense so I decided to drive home. I went upstairs and discovered he'd been sick.

‘He just didn't look right and when I saw a rash on his chest I knew it was meningitis.'

Dr Widdowson rang 999 and gave Jack penicillin. Jack suffered from cardiac failure and went into respiratory arrest and had to be resuscitated.

The family was given bereavement counselling in the expectation that Jack would not make it. Three months later Jack had recovered, except for a slight tremor in his upper limbs, which he was able to control through dancing.

Dr Widdowson described his son as a ‘determined young man with the ambition, strength of character and talent to succeed’.
