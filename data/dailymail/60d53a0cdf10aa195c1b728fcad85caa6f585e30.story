A golf club has claimed it is the luckiest green in Britain after six amateur golfers scored a hole in one in two weeks - including one blind player.

Bosses at Cleobury Mortimer golf course, in Kidderminster, Worcestershire, were thrilled when a party of golfers reported a hole in one last month.

But they were stunned when a further five players, including 12-year-old Jack Severn and blind Arthur Aston, 67, followed suit within just a few days - beating odds of more than a million to one.

Six players scored a hole in one at Cleobury Mortimer golf course, in Kidderminster, last month, including a blind man and a 12-year-old boy

Director of Golf, David Pain, said: 'We just couldn't believe it. We normally only get a couple of people who manage a hole in one every year - but to have six in such a short space of time is unheard of.

'We were just amazed that they all seemed to happen one after the other, over the space of 14 days.

'It's such an achievement for any golfer - and most golfers are lucky to experience one in a lifetime.

'The feats were all at different holes which is what is remarkable with all the golfers of a different standard.

'When Arthur came to play we were delighted to accommodate him, we had never had a blind golfer play here before, and then he got a hole in one - we were astounded.'

Along with Mr Aston, 12-year-old Jack Severn also managed to score an ace, as well as Mike Stevens, Rick Clayton, Sam Pain, and Bob Rudge, who celebrated his hole-in-one by making a donation to Cancer Research.

Four of the aces happened on the same day and started when Mr Clayton struck on the second hole.

Mr Stevens then aced the fifth hole on a different run and Mr Pain continued the amazing story with a hole in one on the eighth hole. Mr Aston then stole the show with his effort.

Course director Graham Pain said: 'It is just incredible luck we have had here, all of the chaps came here to enjoy themselves on different days and they all couldn't believe it when they got the hole in ones and neither can we. Something crazy is going on.'

Mr Aston, 67 from Stourbridge, played a round with his 'buddy' Roy Chapman, 65, and was elated to hear he had beaten odds of a million to one when he scored a hole in one.

He said: 'It was my first time at the course and, along with my partner Roy, I was able to play as normal, with Roy describing each shot for me and pointing me in the right direction.

'We got to the 8th hole and lo and behold I got a hole in one. I have never had that in my golfing career before I lost my sight so I couldn't quite believe it.

'I actually asked Roy to guide me to the hole so that I could feel it had gone in as I just didn't believe it. I was totally stunned to find out it had.'

Mr Chapman said: 'It was a 125-yard uphill hole with a bunker in front of the green. It was a very emotional moment for Arthur when he got it.'

Mr Aston lost his sight due to a medical condition just over two years ago, but has continued to play golf, thanks to help from Insight Golf, Worcestershire. He was taught how to play again at the Guadetluce course, Droitwich, and received help from professional golfer Russel Adams.

Mr Aston said: 'I had never even heard of blind golf before I lost my sight. But once I had come to terms with being blind, I decided I wanted to play again.'

Mr Aston had played golf for 12 years before he lost his sight and had never had a hole-in-one when he could see.

Bookies William Hill say they would have offered Mr Aston odds of a million to one on him bagging himself a hole in one.

Joe Crilly, from William Hill: 'This is one of those rare moments when we can actually offer realistic odds of a million to one.'

Stephen Burnett, performance manager of the England Golf squads, said: 'I have never heard of six hole in ones in such a short period of time before.

'It is a fantastic achievement - really against the odds - perhaps they should make the holes a bit smaller.

'With blind golfing you really are at the behest of the person guiding you and describing the shot, there is a bit of luck involve but fair play, very well done. Six in ten days is really good going.'
