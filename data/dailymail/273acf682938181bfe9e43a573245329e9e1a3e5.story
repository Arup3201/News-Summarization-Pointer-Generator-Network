An independent Scotland may not be allowed to have a team at the next Olympics, it was claimed yesterday.

A Yes vote would also cause divided loyalties and concerns over sports funding.

Sir Craig Reedie, a Scot who is Britain’s most senior Olympic figure, believes there has been a lack of detailed information about the impact on sport of separation.

Sir Craig is vice-president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), president of the World Anti- Doping Agency and was chairman of the British Olympic Association at the time of London’s 2012 Games bid.

He said he believed the IOC would allow Scotland to compete separately – but that the timescale was ‘very tight’ for the Rio 2016 Games.

Sir Craig added: ‘If the outcome of the referendum is Yes, there will be a period of uncertainty for Olympic sport.

The uncertainty lies around what happens if and when Scotland would become an independent nation that is officially recognised by the international community.

‘There are lots of complicated things to negotiate and I have heard people say it would be done by March 2016, but the timing will be very tight.’

Meanwhile, the Sport and Recreation Alliance, an umbrella group of 317 governing bodies, fears the referendum will mean ‘fundamental’ changes to some aspects of sport.

Head of policy James Allen said: ‘Irrespective of the outcome, there are going to be changes, even if there is greater devolution.

‘If there is a Yes vote, the biggest and most immediate change would be the potential creation of a Team Scotland and the end of Team GB as we know it.

‘The second big area of concern and anxiety is funding. UK Sport supports a large number of athletes in Scotland, but we don’t know what would happen there.

'Is lottery funding going to stop at the Border? The uncertainty is not helpful when athletes want to be focusing on training for competition.’
