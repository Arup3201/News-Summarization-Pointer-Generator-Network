A mother-of-three who hoped a boob job would boost her confidence was left with scarred and deflated breasts after the surgery went horrifically wrong.

After taking out a loan to pay for the op, Claire, 30, an office manager from Nottingham, developed an infection after going under the knife. The blood supply to her breast tissue was cut off during the operation meaning the skin began to die.

She said she looked like she had 'gaping holes' on her under side and that the implant was falling out.

Lost her femininity: Claire lost all her body confidence after a botched boob job left her with scarred and deflated breasts

'I was horrified, it looked to me like what they had put in was just hanging out from the bottom of her breast,' her mother commented after seeing her daughter following the combined breast lift and enlargement surgery.

'My implant was actually falling through,' Claire added.

Claire was taken to hospital where an emergency operation to remove all the infected skin and the implants left her with little breast tissue.

'I was distraught, I thought I'd lost all my breast. I had the surgery because I wanted it to look more feminine and I ended up with nothing,' she said.

For the last four years, Claire has lived with her scarred and deformed breasts - wearing two or three bras a day to disguise her real shape. She also had extensive scarring and no nipple on one side.

She added that the ordeal had affected her relationship with her husband, Rob, as she no longer wanted to be naked with him.

'It's affected me so much with our intimacy as I'm always covered up in the bedroom,' she said.

Claire sought the help of TV show Last Chance Salon to see if their expert team could help her 'feel like a woman again.'

She saw cosmetic surgeon Mr Vik Vijh who explained why two operations at the same time like Claire had can often go wrong.

'Claire had two common procedures in one session. Both of these are routine but carry risks and when you do them together the risks more than double,' he said.

Mr Vijh said Claire would need new implants to give her breasts volume  - if she was willing to go under the knife again.

Claire agreed and following the corrective surgery at Hereford Nuffield Hospital her cleavage was completely transformed.

'I'm feeling fantastic. I've had a whole change of look for the new me,' she said explaining how she had overhauled her wardrobe and dyed her hair blonde as her new figure had given her renewed confidence.

Mr Vijh explained how Claire's breasts were now a much better shape and symmetry while nipples had been tattooed on to give a more natural appearance.

Claire said she had never felt better. 'I've put it all behind me now and thrown my old bras away,' she said. 'My life has changed dramatically. Now I can go swimming with the kids and we can have a beach holiday - I couldn't before as swimsuits never fitted properly.'
