Three months ago Francis Coquelin was surplus to requirements at Arsenal, now the French midfielder is considered so vital to their plans he's forced to play even if not fully fit.

The 23-year-old was involved in a collision with team-mate Olivier Giroud against Everton at the weekend that left him with a fractured nose and bloodied shirt. 

The situation worsened when Coquelin was involved in a second clash in the same game, which led to him writhing on the floor in agony before being substituted.

Arsene Wenger even admitted Coquelin underwent a minor surgical procedure following the incident, but that didn't stop him playing just three days later against QPR. 

Coquelin, known for his robust style of play, wore a white protective mask during the Premier League clash at Loftus Road.

But the former France Under 21 international showed no signs of being hindered by the unusual-looking head gear, throwing himself into tackles in a physical encounter in west London.
