The wife of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has caused outrage after posting happy snaps of her charity work on Instagram.

British-born Asma al-Assad is seen preparing and serving food to refugees alongside mobile kitchen volunteers.

In what appeared to be a bid to win back favour across the clone, al-Assad opened the Instagram account in July, but it did not take long before it backfired.

Although some users comment on Mrs al-Assad's 'beautiful soul' a majority of the comments are less forgiving.

'I love ur designer clothes and shoes ... paid for by the blood of your people! Seriously, u make Marie Antoinette look like an angel compared to you!,' wrote one Instagram user.

Others comment on the 'hypocrisy' of Mrs al-Assad being pictured caring for young people when tens of thousands of children have died in the two-year Syrian war.

To this date, more than 100,000 people are believed to have been killed in the conflict since it started in 2011.

But as millions have fled the fighting to neighbouring states, the Syrian regime appear to have stepped up their attempts to show a life-as-normal image for the President.

In his Instagram account - where pictures were first posed on July 24 - the leader can be seen smiling, doing paperwork, meeting children and waving to cheering crowds.

Nadim Houry, deputy director for Human
 Rights Watch in the Middle East and East Africa, said Al-Assad's 
Instagram account was something different to previous leaders like the 
deposed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Libyan dictator Muammar 
Gaddafi.

He said: 'I think 
it is a generational thing, I am not aware older leaders like Mubarak 
and Gaddafi used social networking, but the Syrian regime has always 
been keen to show a business-like image to the world.

'I
 am not surprised by this account, but it is a parallel between the 
regime attempting to want to show a sense of normality and the reality 
for the people subjected to the bombs, arbitrary arrests, human rights 
abuses and violence.

'Bashar Al-Assad is not going to show the millions of people displaced, it's not going to show attacks on civilians.'

An Amnesty International campaigner said: 'No 
amount of photos or tweets or Facebook posts will ever wash away the 
stain on the Syrian government's record'

Cynicism: Instagram users stated their incredulity at the pictures

Amnesty
 International UK Syria campaign manager, Kristyan Benedict, said: 'On 
one level you'd have to say that it's not surprising to find any 
government, even the rigid and oppressive one in Damascus, using social 
media to broadcast and frame its own narrow world view.

'Image
 obviously matters in a cult of personality and the illusion of relative
 stability is important in President Assad's "love me or I'll kill you" 
strategy.

'Naturally, 
we'll find no trace here of the horrifying reality on the ground in 
Syria - of the torture chambers or places of execution. Seeing the 
Assads in hospitals only reminds you of the fact that Syrian government 
hospitals have been used as places of torture.

'No amount of photos or tweets or Facebook posts will ever wash away the stain on the Syrian government's record.'
