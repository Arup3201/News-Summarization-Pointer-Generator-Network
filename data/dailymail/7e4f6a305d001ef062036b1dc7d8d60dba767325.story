Robert McElhill, 27, (pictured outside court) has been banned from owning dogs for 10 years after being found guilty of a string of animal neglect charges at City of London Magistrates Court

Dozens of terrified dogs were found living in squalor behind the doors of a £4m home in one of the UK’s most prestigious neighbourhoods.

Police found the sprawling property, a stone’s throw from the homes of Robbie Williams, Elton John and Simon Cowell, had been overrun with animals.

They discovered dogs and puppies of all shapes and sizes covered in their own excrement, barricaded in a stairwell and without access to water.

Incredibly, the owners of the 10-bedroom mansion in London’s trendy Holland Park were still renting out rooms to paying guests.

But one visitor – shocked by the overwhelming stench – tipped off the authorities after being woken in the night by dogs fighting in a locked yard.

Another had already described the guesthouse as being occupied by the ‘hounds of hell’ in an online review and said he could not believe it was allowed to remain open.

Yesterday, the owner’s grandson Robert McElhill, 27, was banned from owning dogs for 10 years after being found guilty of animal neglect.

But the security guard, whose grandmother bought the property more than 60 years ago, was only fined a ‘token gesture’ of £340 towards their upkeep.

This is despite leaving taxpayers with a bill of almost £100,000 for kennelling and vet fees after the dogs were seized and brought back to health.

One veteran police dog handler said he was confronted with one of the worst scenes of his entire career when his team raided the house last June.

Officers found 33 dogs of all shapes and sizes including a Great Dane ‘mix’, a Chihuahua, a Rottweiler and a Saluki, also known as an Arabian Greyhound.

City of London Magistrates court was told that the semi-detached house, including McElhill’s grandmother’s bedroom, was in an ‘appalling’ state.

Many of the windows were blocked, leaving the rooms dimly lit. There was no bedding for the animals which were locked in rooms in groups of two to six.

Many of the dogs bore old and recent scars and a female Lurcher and her seven pups were locked in a room ‘awash’ with their excrement.

There was even an 18 inch tall Chihuahua that was found locked in a cage just 19 inches high. Two other dogs were barricaded in the stairs and there was no clean water.

Prosecutor Christian Wheeliker said the house was in a ‘filthy state’.

Describing the arrival of police, he said: ‘The officer said he couldn't enter that room without stepping in faeces or urine.

‘None of the dogs had proper access to toileting, including the room that housed McElhill's grandmother.’

The appalling conditions were laid bare in videos shown to the court which documented rotting floorboards, fetid kitchen surfaces and excrement everywhere.

The police officer holding the camera gasped audibly as he opened a door to discover the emaciated Lurcher and puppies.

McElhill was found guilty of six counts of animal neglect and four counts of ‘failing to prevent the causing of unnecessary suffering’ to animals. He was banned from keeping animals for 10 years. Pictured: A seized dog

PC Stephen Pinner said: ‘Overall, the premises and conditions that these animals were being kept in are some of the worst I have seen in my 34 years’ service in the police.

‘The smell and conditions were appalling.’

McElhill claimed he had been working 18 hours shifts for a security firm and his mother Beatrice would look after the dogs. But she said: ‘I just could not cope.’

Sentencing him, District Judge Paul Goldspring said he did not believe he deliberately set out to harm the dogs.

He said: ‘He is someone who genuinely loves dogs, that love blinded him – it blinded him to his inability to look after the dogs.

‘They must have suffered some emotional distress. The dogs were in squalor and the risk of disease was obvious.’

McElhill was found guilty of six counts of animal neglect and four counts of ‘failing to prevent the causing of unnecessary suffering’ to animals.

More than a third of the puppies and dogs seized from McElhill's family home were found to be underweight

During the raid, police found a sandy-coloured Lurcher and seven puppies (pictured) in squalid conditions

He was banned from owning, caring, or trading dogs, under the Animal Welfare Act for 10 years. He was also ordered to undertake 200 hours of unpaid work and to pay £1,600 prosecution costs, a £60 victims charge and £340 towards kennelling.

All of the dogs were seized and placed in police kennels. Some have since been re-homed, but some remain in police hands.

Speaking after the hearing, Sergeant Peter Madden said: ‘These dogs were living in appalling conditions with very limited space.

‘Many of them had no water and there was no dog food found inside the property. There was no outdoor access, no toys or any form of environmental enrichment and they had long nails indicating a lack of outdoor exercise.

‘Almost a third of the dogs were deemed to be underweight or very underweight and after just five weeks in police kennels the Lurcher, mother to the seven puppies, put on over 35 per cent of her bodyweight.’ 

The appalling conditions were laid bare in videos shown to the court which documented rotting floorboards, fetid kitchen surfaces and excrement everywhere. Incredibly, rooms were still rented out to guests at the B&B

PC Stephen Pinner said: ‘Overall, the premises and conditions that these animals were being kept in are some of the worst I have seen in my 34 years’ service in the police.‘The smell and conditions were appalling'

As well as being banned from keeping animals for 10 years, McElhill, 27, was also ordered to undertake 200 hours of unpaid work and to pay £1,600 prosecution costs, a £60 victims charge and £340 towards kennelling
