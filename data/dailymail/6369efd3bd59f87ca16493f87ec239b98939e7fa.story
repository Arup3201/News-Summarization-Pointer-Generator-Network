An investigation into the racially charged Miami Dolphins bullying scandal detailed widespread harassment in the team's locker room that extended beyond the two players at the centre of the probe.

The NFL-ordered report stated there was a 'pattern of harassment' committed by at least three players and extended to two lineman and an assistant trainer, all targets of vicious taunts and racist insults.

Lawyer Ted Wells released the report, saying guard John Jerry and center Mike Pouncey followed Richie Incognito's lead in harassing Jonathan Martin, who left the team in October. They threatened to rape his sister, called him a long list of slurs and bullied him for not being 'black enough'.

In a statement emailed by a league 
spokesman, the NFL did not make any mention of possible punishment 
stemming from the case. The league only confirmed it had received the 
report and said it appreciated the Dolphins' cooperation with the 
investigation. Wells said he does not intend to comment further.

Martin is biracial, Incognito is white, and Jerry and Pouncey are black.

Martin's agent Kenneth Zuckerman said his client feels 'vindicated' by the report.

'He
 feels a great sense of relief,' Zuckerman told The Associated Press. 
'Jonathan Martin is a great man and he's only shown me that he is very 
honest since the day I met him. He loves football and is eager to get 
back on the field, regardless of what team he plays for.'

Incognito's
 attorney, Mark Schamel, released a statement calling Wells' report 
'replete with errors' and said that Martin 'was never bullied by Richie 
Incognito or any member of the Dolphins' offensive line.'

Incognito
 sent a tweet Friday night, saying: 'You could not define me in 144 
years let alone 144 pages Mr Wells. Thank you for your hard work and 
dedication.'

Martin, who has two years left on his contract with the Dolphins, declined interview requests.Incognito was suspended in November, but Pouncey and Jerry remained starters throughout the season.

The
 report mentioned another offensive lineman and an assistant trainer who
 also routinely came under attack from the trio. Neither was identified 
in the report.

The 
report chronicled Martin's struggle to deal with a 'pattern of 
harassment', including emotional text exchanges with his parents and a 
description of him crying in the bathroom after one particularly painful
 attack.

Martin also 
told investigators that he 'believed that trying to engage in a physical
 confrontation with these three - whom he viewed as a united group - 
would only make matters worse.'

The
 inquiry said Martin was taunted and ridiculed almost daily. After 
Martin left the team, Incognito boasted about 'breaking Jmart' in a 
notebook the linemen used to tally fines and bonuses among themselves. 
When the investigation began, Incognito asked another player to destroy 
the book, saying: 'They're going to suspend me.'

The
 other harassed player was 'subjected to homophobic name-calling and 
improper physical touching,' while the assistant trainer, who was born 
in Japan, was subjected to racial slurs.

'It
 was not difficult to conclude that the Assistant Trainer and Player A 
were harassed, but the questions raised in Martin's case were more 
complex, nuanced and difficult,' the report says.Although Wells 
concluded that Martin was abused by three teammates, the report said 
'they did not intend to drive Martin from the team or cause him lasting 
emotional injury.'

April 23, 2013 - Martin writes to his mother: 'I'm a push over, a people pleaser. I avoid confrontation whenever I can, I always want everyone to like me. I let people talk about me, say anything to my face, and I just take it, laugh it off, even when I know they are intentionally trying to disrespect me. I mostly blame the soft schools I went to, which fostered within me a feeling that I'm a huge p****, as I never got into fights. I used to get verbally bullied every day in middle school and high school, by kids that are half my size. I would never fight back, just get sad & feel like no one wanted to be my friend, when in fact I was just being socially awkward. Most people in that situation are witty & quick with sarcastic replies, I never have been. I'm awkward around people a lot of the time because I simply don't know how to act around them.'

April 29, 2013 - Martin writes to his father: 'People call me a Nigger to my face. Happened 2 days ago. And I laughed it off. Because I am too nice of a person. They say terrible things about my sister. I don't do anything. I suppose it's white private school conditioning, turning the other cheek.'

May 5, 2013 - Martin writes to his mother: 'I'm never gonna change. I got punked again today. Like a little b****. And I never do anything about it. I was sobbing in a rented yacht bathroom earlier.

January, 2013 - Martin writes to his mother: 'I have really severe depression. There are many instances where I can't get out of bed... I'm really embarrassed to talk about it with anyone in person, I tried to with you when I was home but I couldn't do it. I've managed to keep it under control for the most part on my own. Anyways, I really do wanna take care of it, because it is debilitating & keeps me from reaching my potential in all facets of life.'May 28, 2013 - Martin writes his mother: 'I just don't really see the point in things. It's a major accomplishment for me if I brush my teeth or eat more than 1 meal in a day on off days. It's not that I'm sad, just unmotivated.'

Evaluating
 Martin's claims was difficult, 'given his mental health issues, his 
possible heightened sensitivity to insults and his unusual, "bipolar" 
friendship with Incognito,' the report said.

'Nonetheless,
 we ultimately concluded that Martin was indeed harassed by Incognito, 
who can fairly be described as the main instigator.'

The
 report comes about three months after the league hired Wells to 
investigate the case, which prompted a national debate about hazing and 
workplace bullying.

'To a
 great extent, Incognito dictated the culture,' the report said. 'We 
doubt that matters would have gotten so out of hand had Incognito not 
set a tone on the offensive line that made extremely vulgar taunting a 
typical form of communication.'

Dolphins
 offensive line coach Jim Turner didn't attempt to stop the behavior and
 even took part in some of the taunting of 'Player A', the report said. 
Several people interviewed told investigators that Turner gave Player A,
 a male sex doll as a gag gift around Christmas 2012. Turner told 
investigators he did not remember the incident, but investigators said 
they did not believe him.

However,
 the report found no evidence that the Dolphins front office or head 
coach Joe Philbin was aware of the conduct Martin found abusive.

The 6-foot-5, 312-pound Martin abruptly left the team on October
 28. He was briefly hospitalized and then joined his family in 
California and underwent counseling for emotional issues. Incognito was 
barred from the season's last eight games.

Incognito
 expressed regrets about the racist and profane language he used with 
Martin, but said it stemmed from a culture of locker-room 'brotherhood',
 not bullying.

Martin 
has said he tried to be friends with Incognito. The two players traded 
more than a thousand text messages in a year's span, and the teasing and
 vulgar banter went both ways. Martin also participated in the teasing 
of Player A, although investigators say he was simply trying to fit in 
with the other linemen.

The report also mentioned Martin having suicidal thoughts.

'Whether
 or not Incognito, Jerry and Pouncey fully appreciated the effect of 
their actions on Martin, there is no doubt that, from Martin's 
perspective, their actions were abusive and hurtful,' the report said. 
'We are not, however, in a position to evaluate Martin's assertion that 
the abusive conduct of his teammates was, in fact, the exclusive 
triggering cause of his depression and contemplation of suicide.'

The NFL Players Association said it will review the findings closely, confer with players and all relevant parties involved.

Dolphins
 owner Stephen Ross said in a statement: 'As an organization, we are 
committed to a culture of team-first accountability and respect for one 
another.'
