Mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik marched with members of the English Defence League last year.

It is understood that the Norwegian gunman who slayed 76 people on Friday took part in a march organised by the far-right movement in Newcastle in May 2010 - and another in London.

David Cameron said the claims were now being 'thoroughly investigated'.

Protest: Norwegian gunman Anders Behring Breivik marched in this EDL rally in Newcastle in May 2010

Rally: Breivik is also said to have met with EDL leaders when he visited Britain last year

Hundreds of EDL supporters, including 
families with children, gathered outside Newcastle's Central Station 
draped in St George flags.

They chanted 'England 'til I die' and 'No surrender to the Taliban', 'You're not English anymore,' and 'We're going to go mental, chicken oriental.'

At the march, hundreds of police officers, drafted from five different forces, guarded the streets to prevent clashes as Unite Against Fascism staged a counter-protest at the same time.

Last year's march, although tense, passed without incident. Northumbria Police Chief Supt Graham Smith said at the time: 'It has been a great success. It has passed without incident.

'Newcastle is a city for peace and the aim of today was to allow peaceful protests which we have demonstrated is possible through careful planning.'

On Friday, Breivik, 32, set off a car bomb in the centre of Oslo that killed eight people, before travelling to an Utoya island, massacring 68 teenagers attending a Labour summer camp.

A leading North-East member of the organisation Unite Against Fascism said it was no surprise to him that security sources were aware of Breivik's activity in this country.

He said he had been on a counter demonstration to the EDL march.

He said: 'It is alleged he (Breivik) has contacts with about 600 EDL contacts in Britain. Given that is the case, it is highly likely he will have had contacts with people in the North-East.  

'Given that the travel links with the North-East and Norway are better than anywhere else other than London, I am not surprised that he attended here. 

'The EDL and other far right organisations do operate internationally - they see themselves as almost Crusaders.'

The English Defence League has issued a statement insisting that it has never had any official contact with Breivik and that there was no evidence that he ever registered as a supporter on the EDL Facebook page. 

But today anti-fascist organisation Searchlight claimed Breivik  was told he would be welcome at their UK demonstrations, to which he replied: 'I hoped so: it’s our common struggle against the islamofascists.'

Breivik used the internet pseudonym 'Sigurd Jorsalfare', a 12th century King of Norway who led one of the crusades, to communicate online with supporters of the EDL and told them: 'You’re a blessing to all in Europe.'

Only a few days before Friday’s attacks the messages to EDL supporters stopped as he began the final countdown to his massacre.

Searchlight's editor Nick Lowles told the Evening Standard: 'This proves conclusively Breivik was in contact with the EDL, shared their aims and objectives and expressed a desire to join them on their demonstration. 

'It is quite clear that the Home Office now need to classify the EDL as an extremist Right-wing organisation and to devote similar resources to monitoring their activities as they would other extremist groups.'

In the online messages Breivik wrote: 'To you all good English men and women, just wanted to say that you’re a blessing to all in Europe, in these dark times all of Europe are looking to you in search of inspiration, courage and even hope that we might turn this evil trend with Islamisation all across our continent.

'Well, just wanted to say keep up the good work it’s good to see others that care about their country and heritage.'

In another posting Breivik claims he visited Bradford with a friend 'some years ago'.

He wrote: 'I’ve seen with my own eyes what has happened to england, i was in bradford some years ago, me and a friend walked down to the football stadium of bradford, real ‘nice’ neighborhood, same thing in the suburbs of London.'

One EDL supporter then wrote to Breivik: 'Bravo, admire your views and courage. no surrender and welcome.'

Yesterday, as Breivik admitted the killings but pleaded not guilty to criminal responsibility in a closed hearing, Prime Minister David Cameron said the gunman's links to this country were being investigated 'extremely seriously'.  

In a rambling 1,500-page manifesto Breivik posted online shortly before the attacks, he said that he was acting alone, but had been recruited to the radical cause by two English rightwing extremists at a meeting in the UK in 2002.  

He wrote: 'I used to have more than 600 EDL members as Facebook friends and have spoken with tens of EDL members and leaders.

'In fact I was one of the individuals who provided them with processed ideological material (including rhetorical strategies) in the very beginning.'

Another source said a senior member of the EDL has also claimed Breivik met with the group's leaders in Britain last year, when he came to London to hear Geert Wilders, the Dutch right-wing politician, speak.

He said: 'He is someone who can project himself very well and I presume there would be those who would be quite taken by that. It's like Hitler, people said he hypnotic. This guy had the same sort of effect.'

The source told the Daily Telegraphy that Breivik knew three of four people in the group and told his Facebook friends he wanted to attend.

He added: 'Geert Wilders was a high-profile anti-Islamic politician, coming to Britain. Everybody was raving about it. He was obviously in contact with some of us.'

Respects: A candle-lit vigil in Oslo on Monday night saw thousands pay tribute to those killed in the twin Norway attacks

A Swedish politician with links to the far-right blamed 'immigration and Muslims' for the Norwegian massacre.

Sweden Democrat Erik Hellsborn i Varberg wrote in his blog that he did not feel any guilt in sharing the opinions of Anders Behring Breivik.

He wrote: 'If there was no Islamisation and mass immigration there would not have been something that triggered Behring Breivik to do what he did.'

He later told Halland News: 'The ultimate responsibility always lies on the offender.

'But you should discuss the underlying causes that drove him, which was multiculturalism.'

Breivik also referred to the BNP 23 times in his manifesto.

The EDL, which has risen to prominence over the last two years with its anti-Islamist protests, has denied 'any official contact' with the killer.

Breivik was placed on a Norwegian security watch list in March after his name was linked to the purchase of chemicals from a Polish supplier.

But the head of Norway's police intelligence agency said they had not followed it up because he had only bought £11 worth of the chemicals.

Mr Cameron, who yesterday discussed the massacre with security chiefs and senior ministers at a meeting of the National Security Council, said: 'We are still investigating these claims, so I don't want to give out partial information.

'We want to get to the bottom of this before making public announcements. But we take these things extremely seriously.'

Cameron, who was at the Norwegian Embassy in London to sign a book of condolences, added: 'Everyone in Britain shares in the sorrow and the anger at the despicable killings that took place on Friday.

'Britain and Norway have been good allies and neighbours in very dark days before. We know that the resilience and the courage and the decency of our Norwegian friends will overcome this act.

'After such a dreadful event the British Government must of course review our own security at home.'

The Evening Standard also reported that Searchlight has revealed that a millionaire computer engineer living in north London is a backer of the EDL.

Alan Lake, 45, is said to have admitted providing funds to the organisation and is alleged to have posed online this week, in reference to the twin attacks: 'The chickens have actually come home to roost.' Mr Lake could not be reached for comment today.
