A close mate of murder victim Jill Meagher has unloaded on the Australian justice system and recalled the horror of losing her 'beautiful friend' in a written tribute nearly eight hundred days after her death.

In a White Ribbon blog post, Aoife Lyons, 32, who moved to Melbourne from Dublin to be with her friend, has told of the surreal time that followed Meagher's disappearance in September 2012. 

An ABC employee, Meagher, 29, was raped and murdered while walking home from a bar in Brunswick, Melbourne. 

The attack shocked the Australian community, provoking thousands of Melbourne residents to take to the streets to 'Reclaim the Night'.

'Beautiful friend': ABC employee Jill Meagher's disappearance and death sparked a huge emotional outpouring from the Australian community

Good memories: In her tribute post, Ms Lyons, front, recalled the years the two spent together - 'some hazy and beer-soaked', others 'of laughing at the absurd clicking of her high-heels, worn down to the nail; of her innumerable tales of ludicrous antics... and so much more'

'Her picture was everywhere,' Lyons wrote. 'The story played out on TV like any other story of that sort, but profoundly different, at once distant and intensely personal.'

'It was a waking nightmare; I would drink myself to sleep every night, descend into an eight hour blackness, to emerge tired, confused, and almost manic in search of distractions.

'The anger came later. When someone you love has been designated a ‘victim’ in such horrific circumstances, it is just one aspect of the surreal smorgasbord that is to follow. 

'There’s an intense numbness, interspersed with boundless panic and disbelief. Then the anger. I thought I knew what it was to be angry, but I had never even touched its surface.' 

But it was the judicial and parole systems that allowed Meagher's attacker to walk free prior to the assault that prompted powerful criticism from Lyons.

'It would be comic if it weren't so tragic. 

'All that stands between women and violent, recidivist sexual offenders is a paper tiger, a check-the-box 'rehabilitation' and a judicial system and parole structure that is as effective as using a croissant as a toothbrush.

'It doesn't get the job done, and it makes a f***ing mess'. 

She added 'the only shred of hope for me is that something positive can be wrenched out of this madness', whether that be considered changes to the parole system or 'something worthy of Jill, something creative and joyous' that could be 'eked out from this mess'. 

Ms Lyons, who spoke at Meagher's funeral along with her husband, Tom, said books, movies and songs often provoked memories of Jill, who she remembered as brassy, self-deprecating, shameless and adventurous. 

She said the past two years had been a struggle and, 'until quite recently I drank as though I were trying to drown myself, and I was. It is a private, isolating hell'.

'I hope I will eventually be able to remember the remarkable influence her life had on me, without the poisonous recollections of anger and trauma - these are totally out of step with what Jill was for me, and I resent their imposition'.
