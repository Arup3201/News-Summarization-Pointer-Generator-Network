An 89-year-old World War II veteran who initially refused a Purple Heart medal finally received it Saturday in Upstate New York.

Richard Faulkner was only 19-years-old when his B-17 bomber went down in March 1944, he was the only survivor and was badly injured – but he refused the Purple Heart.

Faulkner decided to receive the medal now after regretting not doing so earlier,  he wanted to leave a legacy to his grandchildren.

The wait is over: Richard Faulkner, 89, received his Purple Heart almost 70 years after saying no

‘They all got killed and I didn't,’ Faulkner said in an interview before receiving the medal. ‘It's just unbelievable that they all died and I didn't.'

Faulkner was unable to accept the medal because he had a hard time accepting he was the lone survivor.

Conflicting reports say Faulkner’s plane was either shot down by Nazis or collided with another Allied aircraft, but what is certain is that he was the only survivor of the crash over France.

He then nervously parachuted into German territory and hid from a German patrol that saw him land.

‘He had to wait until the Germans had looked for him, they had seen somebody come down,’ his daughter Ann Pennell told CNY Central.’

Faulkner was eventually sheltered by a French farmer who helped back into Allied territory.

‘After they left after nightfall started, the farmer came out and found him and started him through the French underground,’ she continued.

The teen was eventually picked up by a British ship on the coast.

He was lucky to be alive but sustained injuries to his legs and feet from the hard landing. Purple Hearts are awarded to injured soldiers.

‘I don't deserve this. There's a lot of people who should of been honored, that weren't,’ Faulkner told the site.

The heroic soldier was presented the medal by Congressman Dan Maffei in a ceremony in front of about 100 people at his retirement home in Auburn, New York.

Faulkner said nothing after accepting the medal except for 'thank you' to Maffei.

‘Just to be a part of that a part of teaching the next generation about the importance of sacrifice and that you can't take our freedom for granted -- it's a tremendous honor for me,’ Maffei told the site.

A veteran in attendance agreed.

‘He didn't compete for it, he earned it the hard way and anyone that's been in battle deserves to be recognized,’ said Korean War veteran John Marwinczok.
