Orson Welles's last film may finally be released after four decades as one of cinema's most renowned unfinished creations.

The New York Times reported that a Los Angeles-based production company, Royal Road Entertainment, has agreed to buy the rights to Welles' largely unseen The Other Side of the Wind. 

Producers are now planning to unveil the film on May 6 - the 100th anniversary of his birth.

Unfinished creation: A Los Angeles-based production company, Royal Road Entertainment, has reportedly agreed to buy the rights to Orson Welles' largely unseen The Other Side of the Wind 

The semi-autobiographical film is about a movie director, played by John Huston, feuding with Hollywood over an ambitious film. Welles shot the movie in 1971 and spent the rest of his life editing it, before dying in 1985. 

Director Peter Bogdanovich, who appears in the film, will help edit the footage, which includes a roughly 45-minute edited print. 

Welles is said to have worked tirelessly on the project in the last 15 years of his life - he died in 1985 - and bankrolled it by taking on television roles and tapping investors. 

The supporting cast included Susan Strasberg, Lilli Palmer and  Dennis Hopper. Bogdanovich also makes an appearance as a young up-and-coming director.

The new agreement comes following a long stalemate between rights holders: Welles's longtime companion and collaborator, Oja Kodar; his daughter and sole heir, Beatrice Welles; and an Iranian-French production company, L'Astrophore.

Mrs Kodar, 73, has a 45 minute edited print which the director smuggled out of Paris in 1975, and shipped to California.

She has now stored it at her home in Primosten, on the Adriatic coast in Croatia.

In a phone interview with the paper, she said: 'The catalyst is the hundred-year anniversary and everybody is moving in a kind of wave. When I finally see it on the screen, then I will tell you that the film is done.' 

Josh Karp, who is writing a book about the film, said: 'This is like finding the Land of Oz or some lost tomb. This film is art imitating life and life imitating art. 

'It's become so mythical because of what happened with all the failures to finish it and the players involved.'

Mr. Bogdanovich said he will be fulfilling a promise he made to Welles in the 1970s. 'He just turned to me rather casually during lunch and said, "I want you to promise that you will finish the picture if anything happens to me." I was shocked and said, "Nothing is going to happen to you." '
