Tragic: Robert Berry, 42, collapsed at the finish line of the London Marathon and was later pronounced dead at hospital

A keen runner who collapsed and died at the finishing line of the London Marathon had spoken of his breathing difficulties the week before the race, it has been revealed.

Robert Berry, 42, was given medical attention immediately after finishing the race but was pronounced dead at hospital yesterday.

IT worker Mr Berry, of Newbury, Berkshire, was an experienced runner who hoped to run the route in less than three hours and 20 minutes.

But the father-of-two kept a blog which detailed the breathing difficulties he was suffering in the lead-up to the race.

On April 6, he described having to use his inhaler three times in a week, when he usually only needed it three times a year.

He wrote: 'I have now used my inhaler three times in the last week whereas I might use it three times in year.

'Today started out very slow and breathing a big struggle but it got much better as the run went on and I finished 12.5 miles. Feeling strong. Last week before the Marathon.'

Earlier that week he had written that his breathing was 'still not too good'. He wrote: 'Yesterday I did a gentle five miles as my breathing still not too good and knees a little achy.

'Today on the other hand my eyes were itching, nose running and breathing a big struggle, also in the office all day after the gym.

'Was talking to Nicola from the National Osteoporosis Society via email and she seems to think this is not hay fever but due to pollution and the dust from the Sahara. Hope so as I don't want to be running like this during the Marathon.'

Mr Berry, who leaves behind wife Gwen, daughter Hannah, 12, and son Martin, 10, was running the race to raise money for the National Osteoporosis Society after his mother Ann, 72, was diagnosed with osteoporosis 20 years ago.

Mr Berry wrote on his fundraising page: 'I'm running the London Marathon in support of the National Osteoporosis Society for the support given to my mother who was diagnosed with osteoporosis at the age of 52 but whose current condition (we found out later) was triggered from a lifting incident at the age of 47.

'Because of the stress on her lower back, two sets of bones in her lower spine collapsed.'

In
 a touching message on his own website, he added: 'This page is 
dedicated to my mum, who despite being diagnosed with osteoporosis at 
the relatively early age of 52 years, has been an inspiration through 
the continued positive outlook she has displayed ever since, despite 
some quite clear discomfort.'

He had completed a half marathon in 
an hour and 30 minutes in September last year and achieved a time of two
 hours, 36 minutes and 53 seconds at a 21-mile event in March.

Mr Berry also took part in last month’s Reading Half Marathon, with a finishing time of 1:31:18. Tributes and donations began pouring in to his JustGiving page after news of his death broke.

The
 total amount raised at 7pm yesterday stood at almost £3,000 - with the 
number of donations doubling from 65 to 130 in the hour since his death 
was announced.

By 9pm 
last night, the figure had reached more than £11,000. By midnight, it 
had topped £20,000. And at 8am this morning it was already more than 
£27,000. Before 11am today it had hit £36,000. And at 1pm it was more than £43,000. By 4pm it had breached the £50,000 mark.

Mark Jameson, who also ran in Sunday's race, donated £10 and wrote: 'God bless you Rob. Your family must be so proud of you, raising money to help your Mum and others. So sorry it had to end in this way. R.I.P.'

Experienced: Mr Berry had run numerous races in preparation for the Marathon and was expected to complete it in under three hours and 20 minutes

One anonymous donor added: 'I didn't know you but am so sad you gave your life doing such a wonderful thing. God bless you.'

Another read: 'In memory of Mr Berry (RIP). You gave your life trying to do good for others.'

'Overall it was a fantastic day, but it always is tinged with a little bit of sadness when something like that happens'

Hugh Brasher, Virgin Money London Marathon race director

A
 statement from race organiser Virgin Money said: 'It is with regret 
that we can now confirm that Mr Robert Berry, aged 42, collapsed at the 
finish of the London Marathon.

'He
 was immediately taken to one of our medical facilities where he was 
treated by four consultants, including one in emergency medicine.

'He was transferred to St Mary's Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

'The organisers of the Virgin Money 
London Marathon would like to continue to express their sincere 
condolences to the family and friends of Mr Berry and our thoughts and 
deepest sympathies are with them all at this difficult time.

Support: Mr Berry reached his fundraising target of £1,700 for the brittle bone charity

And Hugh Brasher, race director of the Virgin Money London Marathon, added: 'We did very unfortunately have one death of a runner, who had finished, and our thoughts are very much with the friends and family of that runner.

'Our immediate concerns are for Mr Berry’s family. Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with them at this tragic time'

Claire Severgnini, National Osteoporosis Society chief executive

'Overall it was a fantastic day, but it always is tinged with a little bit of sadness when something like that happens.'

A National Osteoporosis Society spokesman said: ‘It is with great sadness that the National Osteoporosis Society has learnt of the death of Robert Berry, one of our runners in this weekend’s London Marathon.

‘The charity would like to express its heartfelt condolences to Mr Berry’s family and friends.’

Claire Severgnini, chief executive of the charity, said: ‘Our immediate concerns are for Mr Berry’s family. Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with them at this tragic time.’

Marathon: Well-wishers have donated thousands to a charity supported by the runner who died after collapsing at the finishing line

Fundraising website JustGiving said today that it will waive its five per cent fee as thousands of pounds of donations continued to be made in memory of a London Marathon runner.

JustGiving said it will not collect anything from the money raised by Rob Berry for the National Osteoporosis Society, although they normally charge a five per cent fee.

Mr Berry's target was £1,700, but donations have soared since his death was announced.

A JustGiving spokesman said: 'We were so sorry to hear of the death of Rob Berry while running the London Marathon for a cause he cared about - our thoughts are with his family and friends at this very sad time.

'As a mark of respect for Rob and his family, we will be donating any fees on the processing of donations made through his JustGiving page back to his charity.'

Tributes: Donations started flooding into Mr Berry's JustGiving page on Monday

Meanwhile, an elite runner from Sierra Leone who disappeared after finishing the women's race in 20th place is still missing.

Scotland Yard launched an appeal to 
find Mami Konneh Lahun, 24, when she did not return to her temporary 
accommodation in Greenwich, where she had been staying since arriving in
 the UK on April 7. Police said earlier that she had been found in 
Greenwich, but later reissued an appeal.

They
 said she was due to fly home yesterday but did not return to her 
temporary accommodation following the race on Sunday. The runner has no 
known links to the UK and was not in possession of a mobile phone.

An
 estimated 36,000 people took part in Sunday's race, the 34th London 
Marathon, from elite athletes to fun-runners raising money for 
charities.

More than 
1,200 volunteers from St John Ambulance lined the streets and medical 
staff advised runners to take on plenty of water and keep well hydrated 
as the race got under way under near-cloudless skies.
