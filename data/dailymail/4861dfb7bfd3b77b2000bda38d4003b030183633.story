Every family has their own approach to maintaining a healthy lifestyle and good nutrition - and the Obamas are no different.

Appearing on The Chew this afternoon, the First Lady revealed all the ways she makes sure her family eats healthily - from making time for sit-down dinners all together to requiring her daughters to finish their vegetables.

And when it comes to dessert, 16-year-old Malia and 13-year-old Sasha have been trained to only have them on weekends.  

Health matters: Michelle Obama appeared on The Chew this morning to talk about diet and nutrition

In control: 'The president isn't a big sweets eater,' she told the hosts. 'I love it, but I’m always watching my weight, so that’s the first thing I pass on'

On the show, she says that desserts are a weakness she has had to learn to refuse.

'The president isn't a big sweets eater. [But] I love it,' she told the hosts, adding: 'But I’m always watching my weight, so that’s the first thing I pass on.

And while she may be in charge of championing healthy eating with her national initiative Let's Move, even the First Lady hasn't always had the best approach to food.

'I learned from mistakes I made as a busy mom,' she admitted. But when the family pediatrician encouraged her to rethink the foods she and her family were eating, 'we started to clean house,' she said.

That involved cutting out sugary juices, making more juices and getting fresh produce from local farmers markets.

And the lifestyle changes paid off. Even Malia and Sasha have come to understand the benefits of eating well. 'They notice how their performance is affected,' said Mrs Obama.

Let loose: However, the First Lady isn't completely averse to a treat every once in a while. 'A treat is a treat, and it's got to be there,' she said, explaining that it's fine to indulge in a few pieces of Halloween candy

However, the First Lady isn't completely averse to a treat every once in a while. 'A treat is a treat, and it's got to be there,' she said, explaining that it's fine to indulge in a few pieces of Halloween candy.

So when The Chew co-host Carla Hall told her that she sometimes doles out pencils instead of candy to trick-or-treaters, Mrs Obama was incredulous.

'Are they sharpened, so they can stab you with them?' she joked.

Mrs Obama also talked about how cooking at home is a great way to control portions and fight childhood obesity.

Indeed, one thing that helps her make sure that her own family eats a balanced diet is having a family meal every evening at 6:30, a tradition that she has followed since childhood.
