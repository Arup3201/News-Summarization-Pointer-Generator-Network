Lined up on the quayside of an Italian port yesterday, these hearses are a chilling reminder of the risks migrants are prepared to take to reach Europe.

At least 300 are feared to have drowned as they tried to cross the Mediterranean from Libya in rubber dinghies.

The nine who survived, thought to be West African, told how many drowned as at least two of four dinghies that set out for Italy sank in 30ft waves.

Other migrants, including children, were swept overboard after being packed 100 to a boat in craft meant to hold just 20, or froze to death during a four-day ordeal without food or water. 

A further 29 died from hypothermia as they clung to the deck of a rescue boat during the journey to shore on the island of Lampedusa.

Those rescued said each passenger had paid people smugglers £500 for the crossing. 

Some had been concerned about the rough seas and had not wanted to make the trip but were forced into the boats at gunpoint. 

UNHCR Europe director Vincent Cochetel warned: 'This is a tragedy on an enormous scale and a stark reminder that more lives could be lost if those seeking safety are left at the mercy of the sea.'

The tragedy turned the spotlight on the EU decision to withdraw rescue and patrol boats that had saved tens of thousands of lives. 

The operation, which was costing £7million a month, ended after Britain and other states complained it was helping attract more migrants and refused to contribute.

The spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Carlotta Sami, says the nine survivors have confirmed the existence of a fourth rubber boat that left Libya on Sunday.  

The agency's spokeswoman in Italy, Carlotta Sami, had said the victims had been 'swallowed up by the waves,' the youngest of them aged just 12-years-old. 

In an incident apparently related to yet another boat full of migrants, the Italian coast guard picked up 105 people on Sunday in extremely dangerous sea conditions near to Libya and with the temperature hovering just a few degrees above zero.

29 people from that dinghy died of hypothermia in the 18 hours it took the coast guard to ferry them to Italy.

UNHCR blasted the new EU-backed rescue patrol as ineffective for saving lives. The European Union took over Mediterranean patrols after Italy phased out its robust Mare Nostrum operation, launched after 360 migrants died in 2013.

But the EU's Triton mission only operates a few miles off Italy's coast, whereas Mare Nostrum patrols took Italian rescue ships up close to Libya's coast, where most of the smuggling operations originate.

'The Triton operation doesn't have as its principal mandate saving human lives, and thus cannot be the response that is urgently needed,' Laurens Jolles, the head of the U.N. agency for southern Europe, said in a statement.

Pope Francis this morning told pilgrims in St. Peter's Square that he was 'following with concern the news out of Lampedusa', saying he would pray for the victims and 'again encourage solidarity so that those in need are rescued'.

Britain's Yvette Cooper MP, Labour's Shadow Home Secretary, responding to reports that at least 300 migrants are feared to have drowned in the Mediterranean this week, said:

'This is an appalling tragedy for hundreds of desperate people to lose their lives making the treacherous journey from North Africa to Europe.

'And it is an indictment of the Government and EU's decision to refuse to support the search and rescue operations in the Mediterranean Sea.
