Rafa Benitez says Fernando Torres played a major role in convincing Raheem Sterling to join Liverpool.

Sterling was just 16 when Liverpool were trying to convince him to sign for the club back in 2010.

Benitez says he was showing the teen around Liverpool's Melwood training base when they bumped into the Spanish striker and captain Steven Gerrard.

Liverpool were trying to convince Sterling to leave QPR, where he was playing as a schoolboy, and Benitez is in no doubt that Torres played a big part in sealing the deal.

The former Liverpool manager told The People: 'We invited Raheem to Melwood and had a meeting with him and his mother.

'I walked around the complex with them and was showing them the facilities and we got as far as the physio's room.

'Fernando was there and I think Steven Gerrard, too. But definitely Fernando. I explained what Raheem and his mum were doing and I told Fernando what we thought of the young player we had brought in. He had a quick chat with him, asking how he was getting on. He was interested in him.

'Raheem was really pleased and you could see his mum was, too – really impressed that the club's biggest players had made a fuss of him.'

Sterling signed for Liverpool for an initial £400,000 and has proved in recent months that he has the potential to shine for both club and country.

Torres left Liverpool a year later in a £50million move to Chelsea, but his biggest contribution to his former club – aside from his 81 goals - could have been convincing Sterling to sign for the Anfield giants.
