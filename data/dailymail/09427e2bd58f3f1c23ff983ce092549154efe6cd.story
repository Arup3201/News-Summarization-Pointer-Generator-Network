Parents and relatives who suffocated a two-year-old child to death by lying on top of her for hours in an exorcism ritual have been spared jail and received only fines.

Amid chants in a darkened room, two-year-old Chua Wan Zuen was pinned down under a blanket by eight people - two of whom were not charged - in a bizarre attempt to crush out the evil spirits they said had consumed her.

The child was held down by the group for what doctors believed were several tortuous hours, but they told police they did not intend to kill her.

A Malaysian court sitting in northern Penang state, fined the parents, an uncle, an aunt and grandmother 10,000 ringgit (£2,000) each after they pleaded guilty to causing Chua's death by negligence.

The child's 21-year-old cousin was fined 5,000 ringgit while another cousin, aged 16, was released on probation.

When the seven family members had originally appeared in court they pleaded not guilty.

But as their trial proceeded they admitted they committed the offence at their home in the northern town of Bukit Mertajam.

An Indonesian maid, who police said had joined the seven others in the ritual, was not charged because she agreed to testify against the ethnic Chinese family.

The family members could have been sent to jail for up to 10 years - but if they fail to pay the fines they could still end up behind bars for up to seven months, The Star newspaper reported.

Forensic doctor Zahari Noorsaid told how the presence of blood in Chua's respiratory system indicated she was still breathing when she was pinned down.

He said it was possible she was pressed down to the floor, as there were injuries on the right side of her face as well as on her hands legs, body, neck and lips.

Police revealed earlier that the family had carried out the exorcism ritual because they believed she was possessed by evil spirits.

When officers raided the house after receiving a distress call from a family member, they found eight people lying on top of the girl in a darkened bedroom, said district police chief Azman Abdul Lah.

She was face down under the human pile and chanting could be heard.

Belief in the supernatural is entrenched among Malaysia's Malay, Chinese and ethnic communities, although occult rituals have waned in recent years.

In 2010 two Malay cousins were sentenced to 10 years in jail for killing the parents of one of them during a spiritual cleansing ritual.

They had killed the parents by trying to beat evil out of them by hitting them with brooms and motor cycle helmets.
