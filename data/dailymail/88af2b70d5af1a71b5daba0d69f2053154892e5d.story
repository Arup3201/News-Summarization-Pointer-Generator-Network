A woman has been found stabbed to death after a sobbing schoolboy turned up on a neighbour's door covered in blood.

A man was also discovered with injuries and is in hospital in a critical condition after the double stabbing earlier today in Wolverhampton.

The child, believed to be of secondary school age and the son of the couple, fled the bloody scene to raise the alarm.

The man in his 30s and woman, 36, were discovered at the address at about 7.47am after police arrived at the gruesome scene.

Gathering evidence: Officers were called to reports of disorder at the house in Newhampton Road West, Wolverhampton, this morning

One neighbour said: 'We heard the 
little lad was covered in blood and crying uncontrollably when he 
knocked on a neighbour's door, that's when police were called.

Carol O'Mahoney, another resident who 
lives nearby, said: 'Neighbours said they had a five-year-old boy and 
that the little one was seen running from the house for help this 
morning covered in blood.'

Another neighbour, a woman in her 20’s who lives behind the block of flats said: 'I know the old lady who lives next door and I went round to see if she was okay earlier.

'She said the couple have a boy and he knocked on her door first but it was quiet so she didn’t hear him.

'By the time he knocked on the next door he was hysterical and crying ‘help me’ so the guy opened and saw him covered in blood so rang the police.

Another neighbour who also did not wish to be named said at the scene: 'It’s shocking, she was a very pretty, slim lady. She was very quiet and he was very quiet too. 

'I don’t know if their child is a boy or girl but it is only young, I would see them putting him or her in the car.'

Police have said they are not looking 
for anyone else in connection with the incident which happened in a 
house that is used as temporary accommodation in the Whitmore Reans area
 of the city.

The scene of the murder in Wolverhampton

The family is believed to be of Iranian origin and West Midlands Police have launched a murder inquiry.

A 
police cordon is in place at the scene as officers investigate the 
circumstances of the woman's death and how the man came to sustain his 
injuries.

The murder is the latest in a string 
of knifing incidents across the country over the festive period including a double stabbing in 
Islington, London, last night.

Two men were found with injuries and 
four women were arrested on suspicion of violent disorder following an 
argument that broke out in a shop just before midnight.

The
 two victims were apparently stabbed when the disturbance spilled out 
onto Greenman Street, near the junction with Essex Road.

One man, aged 42, remains in a 
serious, but stable condition in hospital, police said today. The other 
suffered a minor injury to his arm and did not require medical 
treatment.

A third man, who is not believed to 
have been stabbed, was seen nearby with minor head injuries.

The four women were arrested and are today being questioned, although it is not believed they were involved with the stabbings.

Giving just his Christian name, a man called Adam spoke about the incident which happened on the Peabody Estate.

A young boy fled to a neighbour's house to raise the alarm following the double stabbing

He said: 'Just after 11pm I heard loads of shouting and screaming 
and lots of people ran into the block.

'I thought it was someone having a 
party. I heard someone shouting "f**k off" a lot and "f****g hell, 
f****g hell". They were running up the stairs and down again. 

'It sounded like a lot of people and then there were a lot of police after that.' 

Drips of dried blood could be traced 
from the police cordon to inside the block, with blood on the stairs and
 a large pool by a ground floor flat that officers had cleaned.

Other residents reported hearing an argument but did not witness the incident.

Detectives from Islington are trying 
to identify other suspects as they piece together the chain of events 
that led up to the woundings, a Scotland Yard spokesman said.

He said police officers and paramedics from 
London Ambulance Service were called at 11.56pm to reports of two men 
suffering stab wounds.

It is not known if a weapon has been recovered.

The Scotland Yard spokesman said: 'The four women will be questioned by detectives from Islington CID. They were arrested following an incident shortly before midnight last night.

'Two men were stabbed one is stable in
 hospital. The other suffered more serious injuries, we're are not sure 
if his condition is critical at the moment.

'A third man suffered head injuries but they were not serious and did not require hospital treatment.'
