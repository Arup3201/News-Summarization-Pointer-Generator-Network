A plush New York apartment block has been sold for a record fee in excess of $90million - and the new owner hasn't even seen it yet.

The astronomical fee eclipses the $88million forked out by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev on a penthouse for his daughter last winter at 15 Central Park West.

It proves that while the economic situation may be precarious some still have deep enough pockets to splash out super properties.

Sky high: A penthouse in the under construction One57 tower block in Manhattan has been sold for between $90million and $100million

City living: The property boasts 10,923 square foot of space opposite Carnegie Hall and provides breathtaking views of the city skyline

Views from the castle in the sky will be unparalleled over all of Manhattan, the outer boroughs and beyond

A 'recognisable' buyer has snapped up a penthouse on the 89th and 90th floor of the under-construction One57 tower block in Manhattan.

1. Penthouse in One57 on 157 West 57th street: Between $90million and $100million.

2. The Woolworth Mansion on East 80th Street: $90 million.

3. Central Park South condo: $77.5million.

4. The White Mansion on Fifth Avenue: $49million.

5. The Beaux Arts mansion on East 82nd street: $34.8million.

6. Rooftop mansion on East 64t Street: $29.95milliion.

7. Pre-war home 720 Park Avenue: $27.5million

8. Fifth Avenue duplex: $26.5million

9. 640 Park Avenue: $26million

10. East 78th Street: $26million

Figures from Realtor.com published March 2012

In exchange for the astronomical price the mystery buyer will get a 10,923-square-foot space opposite Carnegie Hall with incredible views over the city.

While Extell Development Company has not revealed exactly how much the plush living space has fetched they have said the figure is between $90 - $100million.

The high sum is thought to be due to uncertainty abroad, which has led foreign investors taking a greater interest in New York real estate.

Situated on 157 West 57th street the tower will become the tallest residential building in the city when it is finished next year.

The New York Post has reported that some potential buyers have claimed there are 'design flaws' with the construction - namely that builders failed to provide a sufficient number of elevators.

But new owner of the high-rise apartment who according to Extell chairman Gary Barnett is from a 'nice family' clearly didn't share the same concerns.

The new 1,000ft building will offer stunning vistas but the enormous structure will block the view from other nearby luxury buildings, which are expected to see their prices fall.

Foreign buyers, including Brazilians, Chinese and Russians, have been on keeping New York and Miami real estate sellers busy in recent months, developers and brokers say.

Russian and Ukrainian buyers have shown a particular willingness to pay large sums for 'trophy' properties. However, Mr Barnett insisted the person who had purchased the penthouse apartment was not from Russia or the Ukraine.

No doubt the owners will be able to afford good window treatments if they want to block out the incredible lights visible from the master bedroom in order to sleep

The $100million mark for an apartment in New York has yet to be surpassed but earlier this year Mr Barnett said a foreign investor was 'very seriously looking' at the Winter Garden unit - a duplex featuring a solarium totaling 13,500ft.

The buyer was looking at buyingÂ  that apartment and another floor to create a 20,000 square feet space for a price of between $100 and $150 million, Mr. Barnett said.
