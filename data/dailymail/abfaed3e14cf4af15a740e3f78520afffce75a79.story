Wigan have opened talks over a possible deal for Leeds United defender Jason Pearce.

Leeds are willing to let the 27-year-old defender go following the loan signing of Sol Bamba as they try to streamline their wage bill.

Leeds also have interest from Cardiff City in midfielder Rodolph Austin. 

Leeds captain Jason Pearce will be allowed to leave the club to Wigan if the price is right

Rodolph Austin is attracting interest from fellow Championship side Cardiff City 

The Jamaica international is a popular figure at Elland Road but another they are prepared to sacrifice.

Aston Villa and Liverpool remain keen on highly-rated 17-year-old midfielder Lewis Cook who has yet to resolve a new contract.

Cook has made 26 appearances in all competitions for Leeds this season. 

Meanwhile, Aston Villa defender Chris Herd is joining Wigan on loan. The 25-year-old Australian, who can play right-back or in midfield, had a loan spell at Bolton earlier this season.
