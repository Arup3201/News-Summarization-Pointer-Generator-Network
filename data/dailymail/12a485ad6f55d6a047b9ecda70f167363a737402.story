He is a fresh-faced boy of 18 - but Harry Styles has proved he's got more business sense than most boys his age.

Not for him frittering away his hard-earned cash on drugs, sex and rock 'n roll. Instead, the One Direction superstar, whose band is worth a staggering £100m, has invested a hefty chunk of his earnings in bricks and mortar. 

It was reported today that Styles, who found fame on Simon Cowell's X Factor two years ago, has just purchased a £3m mansion in an exclusive area of North London - and the spacious four-bedroomed pad is already being dubbed Harry's Party Palace. 

The impressive stucco-fronted house, which has previously been advertised on property finding website primelocation.com, boasts 2,300sq ft of living space, with a large rear south-west facing garden, already equipped with Ibiza-style loungers.

There are four spacious bedrooms, three bathrooms and three reception rooms, making the house perfect for entertaining. And to satisfy any burgeoning passion for cars, there are four spaces to park cars off-road, as well as a double car lift - all very 007...

Until now, Styles, who is currently single but has been linked to various women this year, including Caroline Flack and Cara Delevingne, had been living in a flat in the East End of London but wanted to move closer to friends - including 28-year-old Radio 1 DJ Nick Grimshaw, who lives near by.

Impressive: The stucco-fronted mansion is a 
world away from the East End flat that Harry lived in until now. The 
reception rooms have double doors leading out into the attractive garden

Ibiza chic: The large, south west-facing garden has been neatly landscaped and already has a double sun lounger in place

Spacious: The property boasts three separate reception rooms

Harry's kitchen: The house is kitted out with all mod cons - but will Styles be ordering in more than slaving over a hot stove?

Let me entertain you: The luxury property has a large dining area with skylights lending an airy feel to the space

Big business: Harry, second left, and his One Direction bandmates are said to be worth £100m
