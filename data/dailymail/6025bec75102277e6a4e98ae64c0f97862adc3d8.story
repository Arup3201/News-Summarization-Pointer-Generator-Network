Bullying was a factor in the death of Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement who committed suicide in an Army barracks, an inquest recorded today

Bullying was a factor in the death of Corporal Anne-Marie Ellement who committed suicide in an Army barracks, an inquest recorded today.

Coroner Nicholas Rheinberg ruled that the 'lingering' mental effects of an alleged rape, 'work-related despair' and a romantic break-up all contributed to her decision to take her own life.

Mr Rheinberg has now called on the MOD to review its care for vulnerable soldiers

Nicholas
 Rheinberg concluded that Corporal Ellement hanged herself at
 Bulford Barracks in Wiltshire, two years after she alleged that two 
soldiers raped her while she was stationed in Germany.

But
 Mr Rheinberg said at the inquest in Salisbury that, although the care 
given to Cpl Ellement in the aftermath of the allegation had been of 
'high quality', the transfer of information when she returned to the UK 
had been 'unforgivably bad'.

He
 said he would be recommending to the MoD that it review its Suicide 
Vulnerability Risk Assessment procedures and ensure that medical 
personnel are regularly given refresher training.

In a statement read outside court, Cpl Ellement's family said they welcomed the coroner's conclusions and recommendations.

Her sister, Sharon Hardy, said: 'The family are delighted with this verdict we have today.

'The coroner has confirmed what we have always known - that Anne-Marie was treated appallingly and let down by the Army.

'She was never able to recover from the allegation of rape she made in Germany.

'She then suffered bullying by the Army and was subjected to unacceptable work practices.

'Victims
 of sexual abuse in the Army need proper support, which the coroner has 
recognised, and we are delighted with his recommendations.'

The Salisbury inquest was dramatically adjourned last week as 
new evidence emerged on what was to be the final day of the hearing.

It was 
revealed that three mobile phones and a pink 2010-11 diary belonging to 
Corporal Ellement had mysteriously vanished from her barracks
 after she died.

The 
previously unmentioned items were listed on an inventory made by a 
fellow soldier.

It was among 1,400 files newly discovered by the MoD legal team.

She had scrawled 'I'm sorry' in lipstick on the mirror of her room, the inquest heard

The 30-year-old from Bournemouth was found in 2011 hanging from a fire escape at her camp in Bulford Barracks, Wiltshire.

She had written 'I'm sorry' in lipstick on her mirror.

The inquest - which lasted three weeks -Â  heard that Cpl Ellement alleged she had been raped 
by two soldiers in November 2009, while she was posted in Germany.

It heard that she
had been left 'absolutely devastated' by the decision taken by military 
investigators not to prosecute them.

Mr Rheinberg said: 'It is not the 
function of this inquest to make a determination whether Anne-Marie was 
raped, that may be for another court to determine, nevertheless I find 
as fact that Anne-Marie believed she was raped and was deeply affected 
by what for her was a deeply humiliating experience.'

He
 ruled that although the MoD had a policy in place for caring for 
victims of alleged sexual assaults within the Army, a review was needed 
to ensure that all steps were taken to support the victims, particularly
 in cases where the allegation was made against a colleague.

He
 explained that although Cpl Ellement was placed on the Army's sexual 
vulnerability risk assessment register, this information was not 
transferred to her medical professionals when she was brought to the UK.

He said: 'I find the welfare provided in Germany was good but the transfer of information unforgivably bad.'

He added: 'I have concerns in relation
 to the support and welfare support given to a soldier following an 
allegation of sexual assault.

'There
 is an existing code of practice on services to be provided by the armed
 forces to victims of crime and sexual assault, I ask that that code of 
practice be reviewed.'

However,
 Mr Rheinberg said that he felt this issue was not a significant factor 
in Cpl Ellement's death because she had shown an improved state of mind 
upon her arrival at Bulford.

He
 ruled that there were two periods when he believed that Cpl Ellement 
had been subjected to bullying - one by the girlfriend of one of her 
alleged rapists.

Mr Rheinberg said she had directed her anger at the incident at Cpl Ellement.

He
 said: 'I find as a fact that deliberate action was taken to make 
Anne-Marie's final days in Germany uncomfortable and the actions and 
that deliberate action was harassment.'

Cpl Ellement was being bullied and was 'scared to leave her room', her mother, Alexandra Barritt, right, said

He said it was 'unduly optimistic' of her superiors to keep Cpl Ellement and those who accused her of lying about the rape within the same accommodation block without trouble occurring.

The other incident of bullying that Mr Rheinberg identified was in 2011 at Bulford when Cpl Ellement's superior officer.

Staff Sergeant Julian Clark had made a posting on Facebook deriding the quality of work that he was inspecting.

He said that Cpl Ellement believed this criticism identified her shortcomings to her colleagues and was something that troubled her 'again and again'.

He said: 'I find it was inappropriate for a senior NCO (non-commissioned officer) to make a posting about a junior NCO on a social media website and further inappropriate to have friends who were junior NCOs able to read the posting.

'Although not imbued with evil intent, it resulted in bullying.'

Hopes: Even as a child, Anne-Marie Ellement had dreamt of joining the Army, an ambition she fulfilled in 2006

Mr Rheinberg said that the other factors involved in Cpl Ellement's suicide was her perception that she was over-worked.

He said that although she reported that she had been working up to 90 hours in a nine-day period in the weeks prior to her death, she was liable to 'exaggeration'.

He explained although he did not feel the MoD had over-worked her, Cpl Ellement was feeling stressed about her job and was suffering from 'work-related despair'.

Another significant factor was a recent relationship breakdown.

The inquest heard that she has sent messages speaking of her sense of betrayal to her former boyfriend on the day that she committed suicide.

Mr Rheinberg also explained how Cpl Ellement had suffered sexual abuse and bullying as a child and had previously been raped at the age of 18.

He said that she continued to complain of bullying both in civilian life and when she joined the Army, which had been a lifelong ambition.

He said that she suffered 'poor body image and low self-esteem' and their was a 'correlation between her physical and mental health'.

Mr Rheinberg explained that she was diagnosed as suffering from depression in 2009 and was prescribed anti-depressants.

A previous inquest in March 2012 recorded a conclusion that Cpl Ellement, originally from Bournemouth in Dorset, took her own life.

But last August, the High Court ordered a fresh hearing, which began in Salisbury on February 3.During the inquest, Cpl Ellement's family claimed she had felt bullied by colleagues and without support in the Army.

Her sister, Sharon Hardy, 44, a married mother-of-four from Christchurch, Dorset, told the inquest: 'When she died, my immediate thoughts were the Army, the rape, the bullying and the overwork.'

The hearing was adjourned last week after the court heard an inventory listing items including three mobile phones and a pink diary found in Cpl Ellement's room had been discovered by the MoD.

But in a statement given to the court, Cpl Ellement's father confirmed that he had received the items including the diary and five mobile phones.

He said that he had passed on the diary to Cpl Ellement's mother Alexandra Barritt and he had disposed of most of the mobile phones because of their age but had held on to her iPhone.

Following the inquest, Brigadier John Donnelly, director of personnel services for the MoD, said: 'The Army deeply regrets the tragic death of Cpl Anne-Marie Ellement and although there were aspects of her care that were praised, I want to apologise to her family for the failures that the coroner has identified.

'This second inquest has been an extremely thorough investigation by Her Majesty's coroner and Anne-Marie's family has shown great dignity throughout. We now have a clear understanding of the complex circumstances surrounding her death and where the Army needs to learn lessons.

'Our priority is to study the coroner's conclusions and then identify what further steps can be taken, to help prevent a recurrence of this kind of tragedy in the future. At present, however, our thoughts and sympathy lie with Anne-Marie's family and her friends at this difficult time.'

Emma Norton, legal officer for human rights charity Liberty and the lawyer representing Cpl Ellement's sisters, said: 'Soldier or civilian, your human rights require protection.

'Yet the Army failed this vulnerable, traumatised woman at every stage: an incompetent rape investigation coupled with a chain of command that repeatedly overlooked serious bullying and ignored her suffering.

'As long as the military investigates itself, this risks happening again. The coroner recognised the terrible failings in Anne-Marie's case. Now we need real reform.'
