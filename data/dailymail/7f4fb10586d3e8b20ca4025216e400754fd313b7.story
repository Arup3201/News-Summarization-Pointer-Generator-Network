Alabama congressional hopeful Will Brooke blows holes into a copy of the Affordable Care Act with three different guns in a new campaign ad, saying he wants to 'see how much damage we can do to this copy of Obamacare.'

Before resorting to a wood chipper decorated with a campaign sticker, the Republican candidate fires at the 1,000-page health insurance law with a .40 caliber Glock pistol, a .270 caliber Cooper rifle and an AR-15.

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

'Let's do some damage': Will Brooke has some fun exercising his Second Amendment right to shred a paper copy of Obamacare with hot lead

President Barack Obama was elected to the White House -- twice -- by promising to implement Obamacare, and now many Republicans are running on the promise of blasting it to bits

Yes, it's an AR-15: the congressional hopeful in a red state uses the much-maligned high-power rifle to blast hole after hole into the stack of paper

The Daily Caller was first to report on the controversial campaign video, but Brooke isn't the first to put guns in a political campaign ad.

West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin famously blew a hole in President Obama's favored 'cap and trade' climate change bill in an ad that helped get him win a 2012 special election after the death of Sen. Robert Byrd.

Manchin's home state is the nation's second-largest coal producer, trailing only Wyoming.

In Alabama, Brooke is trying to appeal to voters who prize the Second Amendment and also dislike Obamacare by a massive margin. He's running to replace the retiring Rep. Spencer Bachus.

In the ad, he builds a custom wooden box to serve as a target holder before shooting three guns at it.

None of them is able to penetrate the entire thick stack of paper.

'For those who have already been hurt by the law here in Alabama, it's anything but funny,' says Brooke of the increasingly controversial Obamacare scheme

The final insult: All 1,000-plus pages of the Affordable Care Act go into a wood chipper

Ultimately, he resorts to using a wood chipper to shred it, while saying that 'we'll have to resort to more extreme measures to get rid of Obamacare, and replace it with a market based solution.'

In a statement after the ad appeared online, he said it 'shows that we can have fun with a serious subject, but for those who have already been hurt by the law here in Alabama, itâ€™s anything but funny.'

In the June 3 primary that will likely serve as a proxy for the general election in a bright red state, Brooke will face orthopedic surgeon Chad Mathis, Alabama Policy Institute founder Gary Palmer and State Rep. Paul DeMarco.

Alabama Republican distinguishes himself in a crowded primary field by firing three guns at the Affordable Care Act

@highlight

Each time, the bullet hole only penetrates part of the 1,000-page stack of paper

So Will Brooke, who wants to replace the retiring GOP Rep. Spencer Bachus, tosses the whole printout into a wood chipper
