A student snapped the leg off a valuable early 19th century sculpture by attempting to take a selfie while sitting on its knee.

The Drunken Satyr statue at the Academy of Fine Arts of Brera in Milan, Italy, depicts a follower of Dionysus, the Greek god of wine, passed out in a drunken stupor.

But it is now literally legless after the unknown vandal broke off its left limb while reportedly trying to take a picture of himself.

Mercifully the statue, while still valuable, is an early 19th century copy of an ancient Greek masterpiece which was discovered in Rome around 400 years ago.

The real thing, which is thought to date to around 220 BC, remains safe and sound at the Glyptothek museum in Munich, Germany.

The copy is located in the academy’s hallway which leads to a room containing valuable sculptures from that era.

Due to what was described as a technical 
problem the incident was not caught on security camera, but witnesses say

to take a picture.

The 'Drunken Satyr', which is also known as the 'Barberini Faun' is an ancient Greek sculpture from the Hellenistic era.

Satyrs were followers of the god Dionysus the Greek god of wine. They are described as male woodland spirits with animal features and are often shown with a goat-like tail, hooves, ears, or horns.

The figure is portrayed lying on a rock in an obvious state of 
intoxication. It was was discovered in the ditches of the Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome around 1624.
