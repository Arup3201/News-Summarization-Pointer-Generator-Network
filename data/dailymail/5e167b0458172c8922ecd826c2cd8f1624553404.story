The best photography is that which lets you see past what is being photographed to something else; something beyond the obvious, a feeling, a thought or a way of life so vivid you feel a part of it.

If there was one photographer who became a master at this it was Edward Curtis,  born in 1868, who began taking photographs in 1890 and dedicated much of his career to recording traditional American Indian customs.

Curtis is known for expertly documenting the last of America's tribes from 1906 to 1930 in a mammoth collection  called The North American Indian. Such was his expertise that powerful bankers J.P Morgan personally financed his work.

Edward Curtis spent many years profiling tribesmen and women and their way of life in images such as this one of a Cheyenne male from 1908

Curtis produced over 40,000 negatives, 10,000 wax cylinder recordings of language and over 4,000 pages of anthropological text

During these years of work Curtis encountered almost every hardship imaginable to produce over 40,000 negatives, 10,000 wax cylinder recordings of language and music, over 4,000 pages of highly regarded anthropological text and a feature length film.

From  1905 to 1909 Curtis documented  Cheyenne Indians. The Cheyenne tribe historically lived on the Great Plains on what is now known as South Dakota, Wyoming, Nebraska, Colorado and Kansas.

One arresting image of a Cheyenne man entitled 'Cheyenne Type' from 1908 appears in soft focus with his hair braided  staring into the lens. Another - 'Cheyenne Girl' - is  a similarly close up and starkly intense portrait taken three years before, in 1905. 

One of his most famous images: 'An Oasis in the Bad Lands' taken in 1905 shows Red Hawk, a notorious warrior, letting his horse drink

Curtis's most famous images is the sort-after 'An Oasis in the Bad Lands' from 1905. In it, a character called Red Hawk sits on horseback while his horse drinks from a small pool of water. Red Hawk was  born in 1854 and a notorious warrior who fought in 20 battles, including the Custer fight in 1876.

Water is a consistent feature in Curtis's work as he was drawn to its pictorial and metaphorical influence on a composition. 

Another striking  photograph shows a Piegan man kneeling and holding a decorative medicine pipe in 1910.

A self photo of Edward  Curtis, thought to have been taken in 1899. The acclaimed cameraman built his first camera aged 12 after saving $1.25 and  using a copy of Wilson's Photographics - a popular manual at the time - as a point of reference.

He started photographing local native Indians digging for clams and mussels during low tides and won plaudits at the National Photographic Convention in 1898 and 1899

In the accompanying caption, Curtis wrote: 'Medicine-pipes, of which the Piegan have many, are simply long pipe-stems variously decorated with beads, paint, feathers, and fur. Each one is believed to have been obtained long ago in some supernatural manner, as recounted in a myth. 

'The medicine-pipe is ordinarily concealed in a bundle of wrappings, which are removed only when the sacred object is to be employed in healing sickness, or when it is to be transferred from one custodian to another in exchange for property.'

'On a Sia housetop' taken in 1925 shows a indigenous woman sitting on the top of a house holding a patterned bowl in full jewellery

He didn't shy away from action shots either, as 'Bringing the Sweat lodge Willows - Piegan'  shows. The shot depicts a group of young horsemen  riding triumphantly towards an encampment  with willows 'for the faster's sweat-lodge'. 

A picture of a man taken in 1923 show him wearing a tall headdress. Curtis captioned the image with some information: 'The head-dress is of the type common to the Klamath River tribes - a broad band of deerskin partially covered with a row of red scalps of woodpecker.

'The massive necklace of clam-shell beads indicates the wealth of the wearer, or of the friend from whom he borrowed it. He carries a ceremonial celt of black obsidian and a decorated bow.'

Curtis was christened Edward Sheriff Curtis and born into abject poverty in Wisconsin in 1868 to parents Ellen and Johnson Curtis. After a few years the family moved to Cordova, a rural settlement in Le Sueur County, Minnesota, where Johnson Curtis worked as a preacher.

Canoe trips to visit members of the congregation with his father gave Edward his first experiences of the great outdoors as a boy and their camping trips helped prepare him for research and life in the field.

There were many different Native American canoe styles, and tribes could often easily recognize each other just by the profile of their canoes

The 'Indian was the remnant of a savage past away from which civilized men had struggled to grow,' wrote Roy Harvey Pearce in a book called Savagism and Civilization

Aged 12 he saved $1.25 and built a camera using a copy of Wilson's Photographics, a popular manual at the time.

Reports say he apprenticed in a photo studio in Saint Paul from 1885 to 1886 before his family moved to the Puget Sound region of Washington State.

Throughout the 1890s, during his twenties,  Curtis's interest in photography sharpened. He started photographing local native Indians digging for clams and mussels during low tides and won  plaudits  at the National Photographic Convention in 1898 and 1899 for a series of three sepia, softly focused images of Native Americas entitled Evening on the Sound, The Clam Digger and The Mussel Gatherer.

Edward Curtis once wrote of himself: 'While primarily a photographer, I do not see or think photographically'

It was then that his interest in Native peoples took off and Curtis immersed himself in the science behind beautiful portraits and scenic shots.

He once wrote of himself: 'While primarily a photographer, I do not see or think photographically; hence the story of Indian life will not be told in microscopic detail, but rather will be presented as a broad and luminous picture.'

Curtis's photos show the Native Indians as historical features of an American landscape, supporting the view that they were viewed as a 'vanishing race' by many in the early 20th Century

Curtis's photos  evolved to the status of ethnographic representations which were studied for critical analysis

Thousands of photographs lay forgotten in the basement of the Charles Lauriat Company, a rare book dealer in Boston, until their rediscovery in the 1970s, which marked the revival of interest in Curtis' haunting images of American Indians

From the 1890s the Native Indians were pictured as the tragic cultures of a vanishing race

Attempts to forcefully eradicate Indian culture and assimilate Indians into American society cemented the myth of the 'vanishing race'

All the clothes were made by hand, and decorated with designs, beadwork, and other art, so no two people in the tribe had the same dress

Some longhouses could be up up to 200 feet long, 20 feet wide, and 20 feet high, sleeping up to around 60 in an entire clan

Deer, buffalo, fish, and various birds were the game of choice, with corn, beans, squash, berries, nuts, and melons also consumed

The North American Indian project produced by Curtis is described as one of the most significant and controversial representations of traditional American Indian culture ever produced
