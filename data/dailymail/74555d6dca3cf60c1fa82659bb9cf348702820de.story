Much like Katherine Heigl's character in the film 27 dresses, Sherry Kettner, 31, from Arkansas, U.S. is the serial bridesmaid who is still waiting to find a husband of her own.

Sherry has experienced a total of 13 hen dos, sets of wedding pictures and rounds of speeches and  still gets excited every time she gets an invite.

Her serial role has seen her walk up the aisle on the arm of people aged eight to 80 in churches, fields and town halls for the big days of her closest friends.

Big day: Sherry Kettner (L) at her friends Heathers wedding (R). Sherry has been bridesmaid at 13 weddings but is still looking for a love of her own

Party gal: Sherry attends a party wearing the bridesmaid dress she wore to her sister Kayla's wedding

Film star: Katherine Heigl as Jane in the 2008 film 27 Dresses, where she, like real life Sherry, was always the bridesmaid but never the bride

Sherry was first called upon for bridesmaid duty when she was 18 and did the honours for three high school friends; Camille, Bekah and Amanda.

After
 she graduated university in 2007 she was asked to walk down the aisle 
ahead of two friends Emily and Arlene and her two sisters Ericka and 
Kayla.

And
 since 2008 she’s been a bridesmaid six more times in as many years for 
friends, her college roommate, and a fellow blogger for a lifestyle 
website she contributes to.

While Sherry, who works with adults with special needs for the Barnabas 
Foundation,  has never been a bride herself, she’s still hoping her big day will come.

Happy: Sherry, top right, as a bridesmaid at her friend Emily's wedding. Sherry has been to 13 hen dos, been in 13 sets of pictures and sat through 13 sets of speeches

Never the bride: Sherry, left, walks down the aisle at the wedding of her friend Lauren. Katherine Heigl played a fictional character Jane, right, in 27 Dresses who was a bridesmaid numerous times but remained single

She was engaged four and a half years ago and since the relationship ended she has remained single, but she says she’ll never get bored of supporting people on their 
big day, as well as the rest of their marriage.

'I’ve been a bridesmaid so many times but the buzz is still the same when I’m asked,' she says.

'It’s such an honour to be invited to be part of someone’s wedding that I can’t help but say yes.

'Although it’s common for people to get married quite young where I live, I haven’t lost hope.

'I definitely want to get married and have children one day.

'Until then I just feel so blessed to have been part of so many special days!'

Congratulations! Sherry (2nd L) at her friend Heather's wedding. 'I've been a bridesmaid so many times but the buzz is still the same when I'm asked,' she says

Sitting pretty: Sherry (Back R) at her friend Jules' wedding. Since she was 18 Sherry, now 31, has been a bridesmaid 13 times

Amongst
 the traditional white dress church weddings, Sherry as worn a black 
gown, carried a parasol instead of flowers and boogied the night away at
 a 1980s themed rehearsal dinner.

At one wedding the bridal party even pulled James Bond poses at the altar.

Unsurprisingly, the odd dress-disaster inevitably cropped up during two of the 13 nuptials.

One
 bride tried to be kind by picking a value-for-money dress that suited 
four bridesmaids, but with its grey-green tinge and high necked 
Victorian-style collar that reached Sherry’s ears, it ended up far from flattering.

At her own sister’s wedding, a suspect seamstress in charge of alterations did such a bad job, the perfect dresses that had been handmade for each bridesmaid ended up sticking out in all the wrong places.

These aside, Sherry has lovingly hung onto six of the dresses - and even wears them for parties now.

Sister love: Sherry (L) at her sister Kayla's wedding. Hopeful Sherry says: 'I feel so blessed to have been part of so many special days'

Rock n roll: Sherry (Back L) at her friend Alicia's wedding. Since 2008 she's been a bridesmaid six times for friends, her college roommate, and a fellow blogger for a lifestyle website she contributes to

Blushing bridesmaid: Sherry (2nd R) at Gracie's wedding. In the 13 weddings she has been bridesmaid for, Sherry has worn a black gown, carried a parasol instead of flowers and boogied the night away at a 1980s themed rehearsal dinne

Jumping for joy: Sherry (2nd L) at Gracie's wedding. 'It's such an honour to be invited to be part of someone's wedding that I can't help but say yes,' she says

But unlike Katherine Heigl in the 2008 film, she’s never had to dash between two weddings in one evening - or been forced to plan the wedding of her crush to someone else.

'As much as I love that film I’m not sure about all the things [Katherine's character Jane] does,' says Sherry.

'Unlike Jane I’ve been really good friends of all the people I’ve been a bridesmaid for. They’ve wanted me to support them in their marriage, not just organise their big day!

'All the weddings I’ve been in have been about the people not just a big white dress and a cake.

'I love weddings, they’re great to meet people and bring people together, but if it’s just about the party then it loses the attraction for me.

'It has to be about celebrating lasting love.'

She adds: 'I really have been very fortunate with the dresses - there’s only been one that was a bit of a shocker. And in hindsight even that wasn’t so bad.

'I’ve even managed to get some wear out of them again.'
