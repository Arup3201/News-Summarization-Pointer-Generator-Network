After 40 years of fruitlessly wandering the fields - a metal detector from Southampton hit it big by stumbling on one of the largest hordes of Anglo-Saxon coins, now believed to be worth £1 million.

Until that day Paul Coleman had only found a musket ball and had been moving from one field to the next when by 'pure fate' his metal detector gave a signal.

And when he dug down he found 5,200 silver coins wrapped in a lead sheet - which are now set to go on display before they are put up for sale.

Paul Coleman discovered approximately 5,200 of these Anglo-Saxon silver pennies, worth £1million, in Buckinghamshire late last year

Paul Coleman, from Southampton, was with his son Liam and friend Jack when he unearthed the hoard of ancient coins

Mr Coleman, 59, from Southampton, added he normally would not normally have gone up to Lenborough, Buckinghamshire.

The hoard contains coins from the time of Athelred II (978-1016) and King Cnut (1016-1035) and were believed have been buried at the end of Cnut's reign.

A small number of the coins were today on display at the British Museum for the launch of a report which lists the discovery as the biggest of the nationwide treasure finds.

The father-of-two was with his son Liam and friend Jack when he discovered the huge find while out on a dig with the Weekend Wanderers Detecting Club on December 21 last year.

He said: 'It was just a day's metal detecting, but it was perhaps a little further than I wanted to travel, it was about a 120 miles or so drive.

'On the day it just seemed like the thing that was going to happen. Sometimes you have that feeling, it was so natural when it happened, I can't explain it.

'I just had that feeling that the day was going to end well.

'At the time it would not have been my choice to spend that kind of money to go all that way to find nothing, because that's what generally happens. But I was talked round by my son and his friend Jack.'

Just before the find, the trio had decided to leave the field they were in and move into another.

While making their way they continued to use their equipment as they walked, but he found his friend's metal detector affected his, and he moved over away from him and walked directly over it.

He said: 'It was pure fate, and we drove all the way to the Midlands which we wouldn't normally do, so you see what I mean I felt I was drawn to it.

Paul Coleman said he had only found one musket ball in 40 years of using a metal detector before he discovered the stash of Anglo-Saxon coins

'After that I said to Jack I will always move over.'

He added: 'It's the first treasure I've found, but that depends how you qualify as treasure. I have found things which I treasure, because they are interesting, but this is the first treasure.

'The signal from the find was so large and so deep, that when I first uncovered the first coin I knew there was more than that one coin. When I picked it up I could see behind it and I knew there was more.

'There so much speculation going round and someone suggested that each Cnut coin is worth £250 and times that by 5,000 is more than £1million, but I just don't know and I don't want to speculate, I don't want to get my hopes up.

'I've been doing this for 40 years. But there aren't many metal detectors that would describe themselves as treasure hunters, that's not really why you do it.'

Discussing his emotions at the time, he said: 'I think people want me to say is that I jumped up and down and run round the field, but it didn't work that way.

'It's like you've been doing the lottery for 30 years and you find one day you win, the first reaction is relief. It's hard to describe.

'I was like winning the pools, but not in the sense I was running around and dancing around. It was nice to know all that effort all paid off. I only found one musket ball before I found all those coins.'

The coins are still being catalogued and examined by experts at the British Museum, before the hoard goes to corners court where the coroner will decide whether it is treasure or not.

It will then be valued by independent experts before they are sold to a museum.

On what he would spend his share of the money on, Mr Coleman, he said: 'I haven't really thought about it. I don't really know.

'I have to say our family home is a bit small for family to visit, from Liverpool, so it would be nice to be able to put them up if they were to come to stay.'

King Canute (pictured) was King of Denmark, England, Scotland and Norway at the same time

Ethelred became King of England at the age of seven following the murder of his half-brother Edward II in 978 at Corfe Castle, Dorset, by Edward's own supporters.  

Given the nickname 'Un-raed' or 'Unready' (meaning 'no counsel', or that he was unwise), Ethelred failed to win or retain the allegiance of many of his subjects after the church transformed his brother into a 'royal martyr'. 

In 1002, he ordered the massacre of all Danes in England to eliminate potential treachery.

Unable to soldier, Ethelred defended the country against increasingly rapacious Viking raids from the 980s onwards by diplomatic alliance with the duke of Normandy in 991.

In 1013, Ethelred fled to Normandy when the powerful Viking Sweyn of Denmark dispossessed him. Ethelred returned to rule after Sweyn's death in 1014, but died in 1016.

Meanwhile, King Canute, pictured right, also known as Canute the Great, lived between 985 and 1035.

Although Danish he was King of Denmark, England, Scotland and Norway at the same time.

Canute's claim to the throne of England was initially rejected by this country's noblemen so he returned home.

There he raised an army of more than 10,000 men and in 1016 launched an invasion force that sailed up the Thames.

According to legend he believed himself to be so powerful his command could hold back the tide.

He tested this theory by having his throne placed on the shore where he vainly tried to command the tides back until he nearly drowned.

However, some historians argue the demonstration was proof of his wisdom in showing courtiers he was not taken in by their flattery. After his death Canute was buried in the Old Minster at Winchester.

During the English Civil War, his coffin was among those smashed by parliamentarian soldiers and his bones scattered.

His bones remain at Winchester Cathedral but are intermingled with those of other deceased English kings.
