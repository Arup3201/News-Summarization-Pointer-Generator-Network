A wealthy businessman who had his neighbour's 40ft tree chopped down because it was blocking his view of the sea from his hot tub has been fined a staggering £125,000.

Neil Davey, 51, was found guilty of arranging to have the protected maritime pine felled while he was in Paris with his new wife Sheena.

It is thought Davey - who arranged for a tree surgeon friend to sneak onto his neighbour's property in the dead of night and take a chainsaw to the towering tree - may have plotted the scheme as a post-honeymoon surprise for his bride.

Guilty: Neil Davey was hit with a £125,000 fine after being found guilty of arranging to have his neighbour's protected tree felled

Arranging to have the 55-year-old tree removed simultaneously enhanced the views of Poole Harbour from the couple's sun terrace and boosted the value of their luxury property on the Dorset coast from £725,000 to £775,000.

A judge told Davey that in tasking his friend Thomas McGuire with chopping down the tree under cover of darkness he had not only demonstrated 'a remarkable arrogance', but also put his neighbours' lives at risk.

Davey, who owns an auctioneers in Poole, was ordered to pay out £50,000 to cover the amount added to the value of his property by the illegal act. He was also fined £75,000 and ordered to pay £14,500 in costs to Poole Council.

'Remarkable arrogance': Having the tree chopped down gave Davey and his new bride an unobstructed view of Poole Harbour from their hot tub

Judge Peter Johnson said: 'This was a pre-meditated matter, not something that occurred on the spur of the moment.

'It is clear you, Neil Davey, were the main mover behind it.

'What you orchestrated demonstrated a remarkable arrogance.

'In order to improve your view you arranged for your co-accused to go around to the tree in the dead of night and cut it down, putting your neighbours' lives at risk.'

McGuire was fined a total of £5,515 for his part in the scheme.

Davey had denied causing or permitting 
the destruction of a tree and McGuire, from Bournemouth, pleaded not 
guilty to the willful destruction of a tree.

After the hearing at Bournemouth Crown Court Andy Dearing, Poole Council's planning enforcement officer, said there was strong evidence to suggest getting rid of the tree had been a wedding present for Davey's new wife.

Mr Dearing said the 'reckless act' had been 'all for money and all for that view'.

'We believe it is the biggest fine in the country and it was a very robust sentence,' the planning officer added.

Shock: Steve Bransgrove was woken by the revving of a chainsaw in the middle of the night

The court heard McGuire and Davey had known one another for around 10 years, and that the tree surgeon had been doing some work in Davey's garden in the weeks leading up to the incident.

During the early hours of June 20, 2010, McGuire cut through the base of the healthy pine, which crashed down close to a building.

Steve Bransgrove, the owner of the property with the protected tree on it, was roused from his sleep by the noise and raced out into the garden to investigate, but McGuire had fled.

After being called out to investigate the mystery, Mr Dearing discovered a trail of flattened grass leading from the tree stump to the Daveys' back garden. Then the planning officer spotted the hot tub and some brand-new sun loungers on the couple's patio.

'I realised the owners now had perfect views of Poole Harbour, the Isle of Purbeck and Corfe Castle which had been obstructed by the tree in question,' he said at the time.

Davey denied having anything to do with the damage and claimed he initially thought the wind had blown the tree over when he returned from honeymoon to find it gone.

He admitted in court to lying to the police and council about how long and how well he had known McGuire.

The tree surgeon had claimed he was in Yeovil at the time of the attack but was forced to admit he had been in Poole after a mobile phone mast registered his device there.

The tree will now be replaced by another maritime pine.

It is believed the owners of the property in question are planning civil action against Davey for the cost they incurred as a result of the destruction of the tree.
