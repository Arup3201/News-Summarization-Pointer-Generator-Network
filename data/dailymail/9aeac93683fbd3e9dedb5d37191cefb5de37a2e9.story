These are some of the steepest ski slopes in the world, but one team of thrillseekers loves nothing more than testing their skills by taking them on.

The stunning snaps have been released by award-winning adventure photographer Tero Repo, who has travelled to all corners of the globe from Antarctica to Greenland, Alaska, South America and even Japan to capture his images. 

Top skiers such as Jeremy Jones from Cape Cod in Massachusetts, USA and Xavier De Le Rue from Bayonne, France, spend their time carefully edging their way down the most stomach-churning drops on the planet.

Too dangerous for every day slope fans, the intrepid explorers' battle through thick snow covering rocks which can cause fatal falls and must always be wary at the chance of an avalanche.

Tero, from Finland, said: 'It's really important to have a good relationship with the skiers and the snowboarders.

'I have to understand them and they have to understand me - I don't want to put too much pressure on the riders.

'There is a lot of planning between us and we make decisions together.

These inclines are unlike any other most regular skiers have taken on, and it's clear to see why

'The slope can be very steep and extreme but at the same time everybody needs to know what they are doing.

'When everyone is comfortable we get the best results.'

Tero, 36, first became began photographing skiers in 1997 before purchasing his first digital camera seven years later.

The photographer, who lives in Volleges, Switzerland, is a keen fan of the mix of light and action in each shot.

He added: 'I'm very thankful to have been able to work with such great people throughout my career.'

The chances of avalanche are high which means the expert skiers have to be at the top of their game; this scene was photographed at Engelberg, Switzerland
