Two members of One Direction are being forced to post bonds worth nearly £6,600 to be allowed into the Philippines following a video which allegedly saw them smoking marijuana.

Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson are required to put down the money ahead of One Direction's concert in Manila this weekend, to be forfeited if they are caught using, or impliedly promoting, illegal drugs while in the Philippines.

This comes in the wake of a video filmed last April, where the pair were seen joking about drugs as they appeared to share a roll-up 'joint' during the Latin America leg of their 2014 Stadium Tour.

Bad boys: Zayn Malik and Louis Tomlinson, pictured at the American Music Awards in November last year, have been forced to post bond of £3,300 each in order to be allowed to enter the Philippines

The video, obtained by MailOnline last May, sees Louis, 23, narrate from behind the camera while seemingly filming his 22-year-old bandmate, on their way to a One Direction concert in Lima, Peru.

During the 15-minute journey Louis, from Doncaster, and Zayn, from Bradford, joke with each other and the three members of their crew travelling with them.

Filmed by Louis, it shows them in smoke-filled car, the other members of One Direction appearing to travel in a separate vehicle, with Zayn asking: 'Are we allowed to talk contraband in this?'

Louis can be heard saying that he wants to 'light up' and his handed a lighter and a roll-up from a third person in the SUV.

Both singers can be seen smoking the roll-up and and appear to be making fun of the band's police escort.

Conditions: Zayn and Louis, seen with fellow bandmembers Harry Styles, Niall Horan and Liam Payne, need to put down the money to be forfeited if they are caught using, or promoting, drugs while in the Philippines

Louis appears to be confirming that the pair are smoking an illegal substance, handing his bandmate the cigarette while saying: 'One very very important factor of Zayn's warm up of course is Mary J, herself'.

The band was criticised after the video leak and bandmember Liam Payne tweeted an apology saying 'I love my boys and maybe things have gone a little sideways. I apologize for that.'

He said: 'We are only in our 20's and we all do stupid things at this age.'

Ahead of the band's concert in Manila this weekend, the Philippine Bureau of Immigration is requiring Zayn and Louis to post 200,000 Philippine Peso (£2,996) bond and 20,000 PHP (£300) processing fee each through their concert producer for their special work permits.

'The condition is intended to protect the public interest should the band members commit any violation during their stay in the Philippines,' the bureau's spokeswoman Elaine Tan said Thursday.

She said the band will be prevented from performing if the producer fails to post the bond before the concert.   

This is the latest controversy for Zayn this week, after he was caught holding hands with a mystery blonde in Thailand.

Zayn, who is engaged to Little Mix singer Perrie Edwards, 21, posted an apology on his Twitter account on Wednesday night, writing: 'I'm 22 years old... 

'I love a girl named Perrie Edwards. And there's a lot of jealous f**s in this world I'm sorry for what it looks like x. 

One Direction is set to perform in Manila on March 21 and 22, and a producer is said to have visited the Immigration Bureau Thursday afternoon to post the bonds.
