The beleaguered residents of the 
Southwest awoke this morning to more scorching heat that forecasters 
said was expected to break record highs and threaten the July 4th plans 
of the entire region.

In
Death Valley, California, the mercury unofficial hit 130 degrees fahrenheit on 
Saturday - causing sneakers to melt as the temperature tied the all-time
June record, meteorologists said. The highest temperature recorded on 
earth was 134 degrees in Death Valley in 1913.

And
this week, temperatures were likely to hit well over 100 degreesÂ  in 
Fresno, California, Phoenix and to the north in Boise, Idaho, and 
Spokane, Washington, according to Accuweather.com as the thermometer 
shows the heat rising up to 20 degrees above average.

'Many
of the same locations that broke records over the weekend may break 
them again on Monday,' said the National Weather Service on its web 
site.

The blasting heat was expected to last at least through Tuesday, meteorologists said.

'While
many folks over the interior West are accustomed to and expect hot 
weather during the summer, this pattern is taking the heat to the 
extreme,' said AccuWeather meteorologist Alex Sosnowski.

So
intense is the oppressive heat that outdoor July 4th plans are being 
scuppered and some residents are taking to sticking their heads inside 
their freezers to get any kind of relief.

Las
Vegas hit a high of 117 on Sunday that tied the all-time record for the
city, which was set in 1942, the National Weather Service reported.

And
while the record-breaking heat wave is all set to continue throughout 
this week, civic officials warned that the prolonged heat could prove 
damaging to health.

Indeed,
so hot is the weather that Death Valley resident Mike Wood's running 
shoes melted while a fire-fighter battling the blaze caused by the 
downed F-16 fighter demonstrated how much sweat had accumulated in his 
fire-proof boots as he tackled the inferno.

'The
ground temperatures here can approach a 100 degrees so you're talking

the shoe together kind of comes apart,' Wood said to CNN.

Coincidentally,
this heat wave has arrived just a couple of weeks before the 100th 
anniversary of the 'highest reliably recorded temperature on Earth' - 
134 degrees, on July 10th, 1913, in Death Valley's Greenland Ranch.

Death
Valley is such a conductor for heat because it is one of the lowest and
driest locations on the planet. The 11,000 foot elevation surrounding 
mountain range also traps heats inside like a huge furnace.

Sgt.
Troy Stirling, a police spokesman in Lake Havasu, Arizona, told CNN 
that the health of tourists is what concerns him the most.

'I'm not worried as much about the people who have lived here awhile,' he said.

'It's more the tourists coming into the area, even from Southern California, who aren't used to this kind of heat.'

Chris
Stachelski, a meterologist with the National Weather Service in Las 
Vegas, said that taking in fluids was key to coping with the high 
temperatures.

'The No. 1 thing is to absolutely know your limitations and to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water,' said Stachelski.

morning or late evening.

Staying
in air conditioned buildings was advised and he warned residents to be 
on the look-out for the symptoms of heat stroke, which include, 
hallucinations, chills, confusions and dizziness.

Over the weekend, triple-digit
heat struck again elsewhere in Southern California, while metropolitan 
Phoenix saw just a slight drop in temperatures after experiencing 
record-breaking heat Saturday.

Tragedy
struck north of Phoenix as crews battled a fast-moving wildfire in the 
high heat. Authorities said 19 firefighters died after they were caught 
by the fast-moving flames near the town of Yarnell.

Forestry
spokesman Art Morrison said the firefighters were forced to deploy 
their fire shelters, tent-like structures meant to shield firefighters 
from flames and heat.

Six
half-marathon runners in Southern California were hospitalized Sunday 
for heat-related illnesses. A day earlier, paramedics responding to a 
Nevada home without air conditioning found an elderly man dead.

Runners
in the Southern California race who required medical attention were 
extremely dehydrated, and some experienced cramps, Pasadena Fire 
Department spokeswoman Lisa Derderian said. Several other runners were 
evaluated along the route but weren't taken to the hospital, she said.

Paramedics
were deployed along the 13.1-mile race, and buses with air conditioning
were provided for runners to cool off. The event was supposed to be a 
marathon, but it was downgraded due to low turnout last year.

Department of Transportation spokesman John Gleason said.

metro Phoenix since authorities started keeping temperature records 
more than 110 years ago. The high temperature for the metro area hit 115
on Sunday.
