A shortage of donor sperm has meant that Australia's supply has been severely depleted, resulting in moves for it to be provided from overseas instead.

Fertility clinics across the country are struggling to recruit enough local men as the demand now from single women and same-sex couples is too much. The number of people accessing donor insemination has also more than tripled in the past four years.

Another major effect is that donating sperm anonymously has been banned state-wide, and this has put many men off from donating sperm in recent years. 

Culturally Australians lag behind most other countries when it comes to donating tissues or organs anyway. So there was never that many available sperm donors to begin with. 

A big increase in demand for donor sperm has seen fertility clinics looking further afield 

'There is a serious shortage in donor sperm,' Associate Professor Peter Illingworth, medical director at IVF Australia, said. 

'The demand is such from the likes of single women and same-sex couples that overseas donations is definitely one way of meeting this shortfall. 

'So long as the same practices that are required in Australia are followed overseas it will work. But other countries need to comply fully with all the ethical and legal standards set out in Australia.' 

It is essential that full identification of each sperm donors is provided. In the past anonymity had persuaded men to donate sperm, but this is now a thing of the past. 

Associate Professor Peter Illingworth advocates the full identification of each sperm donor

'It is very important that the donors are willing to leave their identity for the children when they get older. As a consequence of that we don't have as many donors as we need,' Prof Illingworth said.

'The actual legislation varies a little bit from one state to another. 

'But it is the case that in every state in Australia, donors do need to leave their identity, and nowhere in Australia is there totally anonymous sperm donations any more.'

If the same practices that are required in Australia are followed overseas there should be no issues

Prof Illingworth said there were still many men who want to give their sperm so others can have a family, and to leave a bit of themselves behind on the planet, but nowhere near as many as before.  

'There's a general acceptance that the old days of using anonymous sperm donors was not a good thing, and that there are a number of young adults who have been quite severely traumatised by the fact they can't track down where they have come from,' Prof Illingworth explained.

What also affects the number of sperm donors productivity is that from state to state it varies as to how many families a donor can create. 

In New South Wales you are only allowed to use a donor to create five families, while in Queensland and Victoria it's 10 families.

Because of the increased demand from couples, clinics now are looking at a range of options

However, Dr Chris Copeland, the scientific director of the Canberra Fertility Centre, believed that the main difference was that the likes of the United States and other countries were more prepared to donate their tissues in the first place. 

'The anonymity factor has hurt us to an extent, but the number of sperm donors was never great to start with,' Dr Copeland said. 

'Australians are notoriously poor tissue donors. We are one of the worst blood donor groups in the world for example. If you look at a propensity to donate Australia is right down at the bottom of the list.

'It's a cultural thing. People in the US and Europe are more likely to donate their blood or their organs. It's hardly surprising therefore that they're more willing to donate their sperm. 

'We just have to try and encourage people here to be more generous.' 

In their annual report the Victorian Assisted Reproductive Treatment Authority said the number of donors whose sperm was available on July 1 dropped by 23 per cent compared to the previous year.  

Increased communication internationally means the best sperm donors can be found

'The number of men signing up to become sperm donors has dwindled from 64 to 61, because the demand has been so great. The number the number of women using donor insemination increased from 92 in 2009-10 to 311 this year,' explained VARTA chief executive, Louise Johnson. 

'Some clinics in Victoria have been investigating importing donor sperm. The important thing is that regardless of where the donors come from they still need to be identifiable, altruistic, and their details need to be accessible to the who are children born who will want to know this information. 

'All the requirements under Victorian legislation need to be meet concerning overseas donors.'

VARTA chief executive, Louise Johnson, believes all appropriate criteria must be met by overseas donors 

Johnson said that because of the increased demand clinics are looking at a range of options. 

'Victorian clinics are still looking to expand their recruitment methods locally but checking overseas options as well. But they must be aware of the implications of donating and meet our criteria,' she said.

Sourcing the appropriate sperm donors overseas is getting easier though. 

'With increased communication internationally it's less of a hurdle to find the right sperm donor overseas. People are using Skype to discuss possible donation. Counsellors here use Skype as a method of communicating with donors as well,' Johnson said.

The rise in same-sex couples wanting a child has forced some to look abroad for sperm donors

The Age reported that Melbourne IVF is currently recruiting donors through a sperm bank in Virginia in the United States in the hope that Australian patients will have access to imported donor sperm by mid-2015.

'The issue in Victoria has been the legislation, which allows identification as a right to the offspring when they turn 18, so what we've discussed with a group in America is for them to recruit sperm donors who are happy to meet those requirements,' medical director Dr Lyndon Hale said.

Culturally Australians are adverse to donating blood or organs. The same goes for sperm

Melbourne IVF saw the biggest decline in donor sperm supply last year. The number of new donors recruited increased from 42 to 44 in 12 months, but available donor sperm plummeted from 104 to eight over the same period.
