Anthony Crolla's girlfriend has spoken of her pride that he tried to stop two burglars from raiding a neighbour's house - as pictures emerged of the boxer recovering in hospital.

Crolla fractured his skull after being hit with a concrete slab while attempting to stop two men from robbing his next-door neighbour.

The 28-year-old had surgery on Wednesday on his right ankle, which was broken in two places, and was pictured smiling with girlfriend Fran Sanderson.

THOMAS STALKER: Gutted for @ant_crolla tonight it just doesn't shock me at all at this day in age, get well soon m8!

SCOTT QUIGG: Absolutely gutted for my gym mate @ant_crolla with his dream within touching distance!

FRANKIE GAVIN: Gutted for Anthony Crolla/ Had world title fight in six weeks which more than likely won't happen.

BARRY McGUIGAN: Genuinely sorry to hear of @ant_crolla injuries, one of boxing nice guys. Hope he makes a speedy recovery. 

AMIR KHAN: Really sorry to hear the news about @ant_crolla hope you get well soon mate 

TONY BELLEW: My heart goes out to him! The nicest kid in boxing full stop! 

'He just went out and did what you’d expect any human being to do,' Sanderson told the Manchester Evening News. 

'I shouted for him not to go chasing them, but his instinct kicked in. He ran off and did what was right. I’m very proud and just relieved that he’s still with us – I’m just glad he’s still alive.'

Crolla's trainer Joe Gallagher told Sportsmail: ‘He is devastated, absolutely heartbroken, but he’s trying to put a brave face on it. Ant is such a lovely lad and was trying to help a neighbour. He was getting ready for the biggest night of his career but all that is up in the air now.

‘I am just relieved he is alive. This could have been far worse when you think what happened. He is in a bad way but he is lucky to be alive. It’s too early to know what effect this will have on his career and to be honest I don’t want him thinking about it.’

Crolla, who was due to challenge Richar Abril for the WBA lightweight world title on January 23, said late on Wednesday: 'I am absolutely amazed at the amount of support. I’ve been taken aback with the amount of goodwill from fans and friends.

'I feel blessed to have this amount of support. I was only doing what any normal person would do in protecting my neighbour’s property.

'Despite everything, I’m determined to fulfil my dream, and come back to become a world champion in 2015.' 

Unfortunately it is not the first attack on a boxer in 2014. Kell Brook was stabbed while on holiday earlier this year.

The grim details of the attack on Crolla were that he was at home in Chadderton, Greater Manchester, when he heard the burglar alarm sounding from next door.

After a phone call went unanswered, Crolla is believed to have spotted through a window that his neighbour’s patio door had been caved in. Crolla is understood to have shouted at the intruders, who fled. The 5ft 8in boxer chased and caught one, but the other is alleged to have hit him over the head with a slab of concrete.

‘Had it been at a slightly different angle then Anthony might have been killed,’ Gallagher added. ‘When he was hit he fell and broke his ankle. He has a deep cut down his head from his hairline to eyebrow. He’s had stitches and he had surgery on his ankle and they’ve had to put pins in.’

Craig Townsend, whose house was being burgled, said: ‘I texted him last night to thank him and say sorry for everything. He replied saying, “Don’t worry about it, we’re neighbours, we look after each other”. His attitude says everything about him, he’s just a great guy.’

Crolla's fight with Abril has been postponed and his promoter, Eddie Hearn, is in talks to rearrange the bout. But it is not yet known whether the fighter will be able to return to the ring. 

Gallagher, who was with Crolla in hospital in Oldham, said: ‘He is devastated, obviously. This guy was about to fight for a world title. At the moment that’s not important, all that matters is his health.

‘But we’ve been joking as well. I was asking him, “Who do you think you are, Batman? Did you think you were going to put them both in headlocks and frogmarch them to the police station?”.

‘This wasn’t his house, but it shows the kind of guy he is that he was trying to help a neighbour.’ 

Hearn said: ‘Unfortunately the January 23 fight is off but our concerns right now are with Ant and his family.

‘I have spoken to Richar Abril’s team and we are trying to reschedule the fight.’

Detective Sergeant Richard Arthern said: ‘The victim was outraged that these two men had broken into his neighbour’s home and gave chase. When he caught up with one of them he was hit with such force, he received a fractured skull.

‘He staggered backwards and fell to the ground, leaving him with a broken ankle and in a lot of pain.’

Crolla has won 29 of his 35 fights and next month’s would have provided the biggest payday of his career.
