A 73-year-old Montreal drama teacher who appeared in some softcore budget films over 40 years ago - one called The Secret Diary of a Nymphomaniac - has been fired from her position at the elite private school after some students traced back her racy roles.

Jacqueline Laurent-Auger says she briefly worked as a young erotic actress in Paris - appearing in titles like Swedish Sex Games and Nathalie: Escape From Hell, but nothing pornographic - in the 1970s before returning to her native Quebec.

She continued a career in TV and film before settling as a teacher, having taught at the prestigious private school Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf for the last 15 years, according to The National Post.

However Laurent-Auger is now out of a job after some male students tracked down some of her work online, presumably by accessing her IMDB page.

Fired: Drama teacher Jacqueline Laurent-Auger, 73, as fired from private boys school Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf after some students tracked down a set of erotic films she appeared in between 1960 and the 1970s

Controversial: One of the racy titles Laurent-Auger appeared in was Campo de Perversion, which was released in English as Nathalie: Escape From Hell and was set inside a Nazi war camp

Tasteful: In Nathalie: Escape From Hell, Laurent-Auger plays a 'sadistic female SS officer' who tortures an American doctor imprisoned at a Nazi concentration camp

Finale: In this scene, Laurent-Auger's character is shot and killed by the Americans

Sex cinema: Le journal intime d’une nymphomane (The Secret Diary of a Nymphomaniac) and Lorna The Exorcist are some of the titles Laurent-Auger appeared in as a young woman

The school deemed the material - some of which included nude scenes - as unacceptable behavior of a teacher, regardless of when it was filmed.

'The fact these films were made 40 years ago does not change their risqué, suggestive — explicit even — nature,' the school told The National Post.

'Thanks to the Internet, it appears these types of films from the 1970s have come back in fashion.

'As educators, we had to ask what message is transmitted to all our students, boys and girls, from the first year of high school to the fifth, by the fact that the teacher of their drama workshops could now be seen on the Internet in the most suggestive of scenes.'

Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf is considered the best school in Quebec.

However Laurent-Auger thinks the move is outrageous.

She believes, as an elderly woman, the decisions she made in her twenties should not have any great leaning on her life.

'It’s completely absurd,' she told Radio-Canada.

'I’m 73 years old.

Elite: Collège Jean-de-Brébeuf is considered the best boys school in Quebec

'When I made those films I must have been 28 or 29.

'It was to make a living so that after(wards) I could work with great teachers and actors, in Paris and in Quebec. Come on.'

'It is too bad (the principal) said something so stupid, that I was distracting (the students).

'They should have been made to understand what was the cinema of that period.'

Laurent-Auger said the films reflect what was happening in cinema at the time and are not considered pornographic but just 'open-minded'. 

An online petition has been start in order to get Laurent-Auger her job back.

There were reports late Wednesday Laurent-Auger had been talking with the school about a new outcome.
