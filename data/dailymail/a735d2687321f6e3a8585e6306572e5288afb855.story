Missing: Botanist Jamie Taggart, 41, from Argyll and Bute
in Scotland, has been missing for more than five weeks in the mountains
of north Vietnam

Searches are under way for a British botanist who has been missing in the moutains of north Vietnam for more than five weeks.

Jamie Taggart, from Argyll and Bute in Scotland, was last seen heading off from the frontier town of Sapa on a plant-hunting trip in the wilderness earlier this month.

Inquiries by his family have revealed that alarm was raised about the 41-year-old's whereabouts on November 2, when his rucksack and passport were found at a guest house.

Sapa is the capital of Sa Pa District in Lào Cai Province in northwest Vietnam, near the border with China. The Hoàng Liên Son range of mountains dominates the district, which is at the eastern extremity of the Himalayas.

Local police and the British embassy in Hanoi, 240 miles south of Sapa, were informed of his disappearance, but searches have so far been fruitless.

Mr Taggart runs Linn Botanic Gardens in the village of Cove on the Rosneath peninsula. He also serves his community as a retained firefighter.

His father, Jim Taggart, found out his son was missing when he failed to appear on a scheduled flight home to Scotland on November 29.

Dr Taggart said: 'He is being searched for, so far without result of any kind. I only heard about it when he did not come home on the flight he was booked on.

'Something has happened to him, but not necessarily an accident on a hill.'

The botanist, who is a keen runner, arrived at a guest house in Sapa on October 30 and left on a motorbike taxi to explore the hills.

On November 2 his rucksack and passport were found at the accommodation.

Dr Taggart told BBC Radio Scotland that he had very limited knowledge about the situation. After arriving, Mr Taggart sent a handful of text messages to his father before the contact stopped.

Dr Taggart said: 'The last text message said exactly where he was going. He discussed it with me before. I assumed his mobile phone had failed.'

Dr Taggart said his son was on his own on the trip but had been to that area two years ago and knew his way around. He said there had already been two days of dedicated searching in the area near Sapa.

'I don't think he had got lost. Either something happened to him on his first day on the hills or there is some explanation we can only guess at,' he told the Good Morning Scotland programme.

'He was found to be missing because he'd left his rucksack in the guesthouse he was staying in.

'The guesthouse, when he didn't come back, phoned the local police. They had a look and didn't see him.

'He had left his passport behind. I understand that when travelling in Vietnam you have to have identity.

'He might have deliberately left it, knowing my son, in case he lost it on the hill.

'He is now actively being looked for.'

Police and the British embassy in Hanoi 
were informed of Mr Taggart's disappearance, but searches have so far 
been fruitless. His family only realised he was missing after he failed 
to turn up on his scheduled flight home

The missing man's father said the Foreign Office is 'on the case' while various people including Lord McFall and Argyll and Bute Lib Dem MP Alan Reid were also said to be in touch with the authorities.

Mr Taggart was last seen heading off from the frontier town of Sapa on a plant-hunting trip in the wilderness. His possessions were left in a hotel

Prayers have been said for Mr Taggart at Craigrownie Church.

He took over responsibility for Linn Botanic Gardens from his father in 1997.

In March this year the attraction was added to Historic Scotland's Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes.

A Scottish Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said many people desperately want to see Mr Taggart return home safely.

Area commander Paul Connelly, the senior officer for Argyll and Bute, said: 'This is obviously an extremely difficult time for Jamie's family and friends and we can only hope there will be a positive outcome.

'Jamie has served his community as a dedicated and professional firefighter and is a popular member of a very close-knit and highly experienced team at Cove.

'There are a great many people who desperately want to see him return home safe.'

A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: 'We are aware that a British national was reported missing on October 31 whilst in the Sapa Mountain area, Vietnam.'

'We are in close contact with the local authorities and are providing consular assistance to their family at this difficult time.'
