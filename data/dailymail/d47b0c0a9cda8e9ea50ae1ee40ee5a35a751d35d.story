Keep dancing: Sir Bruce and his third wife Wilnelia

As he celebrates his 87th birthday tomorrow, Sir Bruce Forsyth will treat himself to a Pink Panther, a refreshing mix of champagne and cranberry juice.

‘It’s delicious,’ he said. ‘I’ve never been a massive drinker, but it’s lovely.’

Mixing his food groups is usually a no-no for the former Strictly Come Dancing host, however. He is an ardent follower of the Hay diet, which advises against mixing proteins with carbohydrates.

Indeed, he credits his longevity to his healthy eating regime, lots of exercise and the enduring love of his third wife Wilnelia, to whom he has been married for almost 32 years.

A weekly massage and a handful of vitamin D, E and C supplements each day have also helped Sir Bruce to maintain his stamina. 

Lifting the lid on his maintenance regime, he said: ‘I never miss taking my supplements and I regard massage as a medicine.

‘I have a masseuse called Alicia who comes to the house. I do the Hay diet where I don’t have potatoes with meat or fish and I drink lots of water.’

Sir Bruce, who has enjoyed a seven-decade career, does, however, admit to some vices. 

‘I love chocolate. I can’t go a day without chocolate. I love dark chocolate. Green and Blacks and Lindt and Belgian chocolate. I do have a few squares a day,’ he said.

Despite retiring from hosting Strictly Come Dancing, the veteran entertainer has no intention of slowing down – with performances of his one-man show planned for across Britain in the coming weeks. 

The star said he is especially pleased to be returning to the London Palladium. 

‘It’s the first time in ten years since I have performed [there] and I am really looking forward to it. When the day comes and I can’t do this any longer then so be it. But I will do it as long as I can because it’s in my blood.’

The Hay diet is based on the principle of segregating certain food types, such as not mixing proteins with carbohydrates and having three regular meals a day.

It was created in the 1920s by New York physician William Howard Hay after he developed a life-threatening kidney disease.

Modern-day fans include actresses Elizabeth Hurley and Catherine Zeta Jones.

The science underpinning the diet has been called ‘unfounded’ by experts because it ignores the fact that carbohydrate-rich foods contain significant amounts of protein.

Sir Bruce is currently enjoying himself in Puerto Rico, where he spends four months of the year with Wilnelia.

He said of his birthday: ‘To celebrate I am hoping to do what I did last year and that is to have a game of golf in the morning outside in the lovely 80 degree heat.

‘Then I will have lunch in a hotel in San Juan with some friends, which of course would not be complete without Bruce’s Pink Panther. 

'In fact I think we will let the Panther loose! You put about an inch of cranberry into a glass – you must always do that first – and then you pour champagne over it. It’s delicious.’

After a nap, Sir Bruce will watch the Oscars – which are also celebrating their 87th birthday this year – until 1am. 

‘At some point I will speak to my son and daughters on the phone as well,’ he said. ‘I have nine grandchildren and three great-grand children. They make me feel proud but at the same time, it makes me feel old!’
