TV presenter Holly Willoughby has been named the celebrity with the best-dressed bump, picking up  almost a quarter (24 per cent) of the vote

The survey quizzed 620 women on who they thought had the most stylish bump from a list of famous faces.

Hot on Holly’s heels was Girls Aloud star Kimberley Walsh who’s due to have her first baby later on this year.

Holly Willoughby, (pictured left with This Morning co-host Phillip Schofield), tends to opt for chic and comfortable options to see her through her pregnancy in style - a strategy that has won her many fans

Kimberley Walsh, who came second in the poll, gently patted her baby bump as she arrived at BBC Breakfast in Manchester on Monday

Not to be outdone by her sister, Kourtney Kardashian has been looking particularly stylish during her third pregnancy

The pop star picked up 21 per cent of the vote and was praised for her stylish, body-con maternity wear.

American socialite Kourtney Kardashian, who’s pregnant with her third child, came third in the poll, with 15 per cent of the vote.

She was followed by TOWIE star Billie Faiers, who’s due to give birth to her first baby with partner Greg Shepherd in July, with 14 per cent of the women agreeing she had the most stylish bump.

US movie star Mila Kunis came in at fifth place with nine per cent of the vote. The women questioned loved her relaxed maternity style.

Scarlett Johannson picked up seven per cent of the vote, with model mum-to-be Erin O’Connor coming in at seventh place, with six per cent agreeing she dressed her bump well.

Athlete Jessica Ennis Hill took the eighth spot with three per cent of the vote, with X Factor winner Sam Bailey coming in at number nine with just one per cent.

Perhaps unsurprisingly Katie Price's take on maternity wear did not prove popular

Katie Price, who’s pregnant with her fifth child failed to poll any votes, with respondents saying she preferred to parade her bump rather than dress it.

1. Holly Willoughby 24%

2. Kimberley Walsh 21%

3. Kourtney Kardashian 15%

4. Billie Faiers 14%

5. Mila Kunis 9%

6. Scarlett Johansson 7%

7. Erin O’Connor 6%

8. Jessica Ennis Hill 3%

9. Sam Bailey 1%

10. Katie Price 0%

One woman said: 'Holly Willoughby has impeccable taste and style. She always looks classy and fashionable and dresses appropriately for her age and the presenting work she does. She definitely has a pregnancy glow at the moment – she looks terrific.'

Another said: 'Kimberley Walsh looks amazing. Her maternity outfits have been so her – very stylish, figure-hugging and not straying too far away from what she normally wears.'

A third commented: 'Katie Price’s taste in maternity fashion leaves a lot to be desired. Some of the pictures I’ve seen of her are downright garish, and in others she seems to prefer to show off her growing belly and leave it undressed.'

A spokesperson for My1stYears.com, who conducted the survey, said: 'When you’re pregnant, especially towards the latter stages, the priority has to be staying cool and comfortable, rather than following fashion and wearing the most stylish outfit you can find.

'Most of these celebrities do look great – they combine comfort with style and pull of the yummy mummy to be look to a tee.'
