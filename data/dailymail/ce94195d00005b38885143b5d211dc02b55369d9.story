Under cover of darkness, a team of Taliban fighters creep out to bury a deadly improvised explosive device in Afghanistan.

The four insurgents intend to wreak death and destruction by blowing up a convoy of US and Afghan troops travelling along the dirt road unaware of the danger ahead.

But on this occasion, carnage was averted... thanks to RAF fast jets.

Scroll down for video...

The Tornado GR4 is both a powerful warplane, and a psychological tool, as proved by the most recent Taliban IED event

One Tornado GR4 aircraft’s state-of-the-art cameras spotted the would-be killers planting the homemade bomb.

Seconds later, a second British warplane roared just 100ft above the insurgents’ heads in an intimidating show of force, causing them to flee in terror.

Using information from the jets’ advanced Litening III surveillance pod, which sends real-time images to commanders, coalition forces were able to locate and destroy the hastily-buried bomb.

The extraordinary footage has been released for the first time by the Ministry of Defence.

The dramatic video illustrates the 
array of capabilities available to UK troops to smash the Taliban's 
bomb-making networks and protect International Security Assistance Force
 soldiers.

The incident took place on March 10 and involved jets from the RAF's II (AC) Squadron deployed in Kandahar, southern Afghanistan.

The British aircrews had been tasked to support the convoy as it moved through Herat Province, in the west of the wartorn country, following an earlier IED blast.

Flight Lieutenant Geoff Williams, who 
flew one Tornado, said: 'Identifying insurgent activity from 10,000 feet
 can be challenging but in this case it was clearly suspicious.

'Two
 people on a motorbike rendezvoused with two others waiting by a small 
bridge. They collected items stored under the bridge and began digging 
in the road.'

Aware the insurgents were planting a 
roadside bomb, Ft Lt Williams flew low and fast and fired flares to 
frighten the insurgents who scattered on motorbike.

He said: 'Having been startled by our jet noise the insurgents fled by motorbike. The whole event was over in a minute.

'The
 presence of a Tornado provides a huge psychological impact, reassuring 
ISAF troops and the civilian population, and sparking fear in the 
insurgents.'

The rest of the insurgents scatter as the GR4 Tornado whizzes over their heads, leaving the IED on the road, which is tracked through heat signatures using their incredibly high tech cameras

Wing Commander Jez Holmes, II(AC) Squadron's officer commanding who piloted the second aircraft in the mission, said: 'The troops found enough explosives to have caused multiple casualties among coalition forces or the local civilian population.

'It’s good to have removed that threat.'

The Tornados did not fire missiles at the insurgents so they could exploit evidence from the IEDs and gather intelligence on who was laying them.

US Sergeant Louis Awua, a forward air controller with the Texas-based 2nd Battalion, 5th Infantry of the 1st Armoured Division which had troops in the convoy, said: 'When the Brits do shows of presence they almost scrape the ground.

'They fly so low you don't know what it means.

'What I like is the quality of the pilots and the quality of the sensors. They report everything that they see.'

The heavily-armed Tornado GR4s are based at Kandahar Airfield as part of the RAF’s 904 Expeditionary Air Wing.

They are routinely called on to support ground forces across Afghanistan.

Although the aircraft can use precision weapons such as devastating Hellfire missiles to target insurgents, many contacts with the enemy involve using non-lethal shows of force and presence.

Earlier in March II(AC) Squadron Tornado GR4s were involved in another life-saving operation using the Litening III pod.

The device provided Afghan forces with aerial surveillance of insurgents who were firing on them, pinpointing the enemy's position to give the ANSF a tactical advantage during the battle.

The Tornados' missions are commanded by 83 Expeditionary Air Group, based in the Middle East.

Wing Commander Graham Pemberton, Chief of Staff (Operations) at 83 EAG, said: 'The IED incident is a fantastic example of the GR4's flexibility, speed and capability.

'It is always satisfying to know our aircrew have made a real difference to our colleagues on the ground.'
