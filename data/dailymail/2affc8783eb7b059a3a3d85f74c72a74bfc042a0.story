The Costa Rica squad took to the training pitch in Brazil to prepare for their quarter-final showdown with Holland.

The winner of the all-or-nothing tie will find themselves in the last four of the World Cup, and Costa Rica look hellbent on making a case for themselves.

Arsenal forward Joel Campbell looked in prime condition as he trained in Sao Paulo, days after his efforts against Greece in the last 16 left him looking exhausted by the end of extra time.

His tiring performance didn't warp his ability to take a fine penalty, though.

Campbell, with a shuffled run up to get a feel for which way Greek goalkeeper Orestis Karnezis was going, slotted the ball coolly into the bottom-left corner. The finish screamed of composure.

Costa Rica may not mind taking the Netherlands to penalties, should it come down to another 120-minute stalemate, after they scored all five perfectly against Greece.
