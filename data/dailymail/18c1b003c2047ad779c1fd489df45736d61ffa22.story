A British farmer has become the first producer in Europe of Japanese superfood wasabi.

Tom Amery is supplying the UK's Michelin-starred restaurants with wasabi stems - used to make a hot paste traditionally eaten with sushi - after successfully managing to grow the notoriously difficult to cultivate plant.

The Dorset-based watercress farmer's customers now include Raymond Blanc after his plant, which is grown in a top-secret location, began to bear fruit.

Hot demand: Farmer Tom Amery, seen holding a wasabi rhizome, is supplying Britain's Michelin-starred restaurants with the super-hot stems

Growing wasabi, which is similar to cabbage and horseradish, is a difficult and painstaking process as it requires precise water flow and light conditions. The plant also takes two years to harvest.

It grows naturally along stream beds in mountain river valleys in Japan, but until now has only been available in the UK in powder or paste form from supermarkets.

Now London's The Ledbury - which was this week named as the UK's best restaurant - and Raymond Blanc's Le Manoir in Oxfordshire are among the exclusive eateries lining up to buy fresh wasabi from Mr Amery, who runs a watercress farm near Bere Regis in Dorset.

Rhizome: The oriental superfood is now flourishing at a top-secret location in Dorset

The farmer, who tried a variety of growing methods and waited two years to learn if any had been successful, has kept the location of his crop under wraps to avoid the attention of potential competitors

When grated down the stem - or rhizome - is used to make the wasabi paste usually served with sushi, but Mr Amery said his customers are using the plants to experiment with wasabi by adding it to sauces and meat and fish dishes.

'Because it takes two years to grow we 
had to wait to see if we had been successful, which is probably why it 
hasn’t been successful here before,' he said.

'Until
we started selling the wasabi we had to keep it very secret to protect 
our rights and also because we weren’t sure what the results were going 
to be.

'We are now producing 
about 100 rhizomes a week and selling them to chefs and restaurants who 
have been experimenting with ways of using it in their food.'

The rhizomes sell for between £8 and £45 depending on their size.

Mr Amery, who is managing director of The Watercress Company and new firm The Wasabi Company said: 'The company has been working with watercress for about 120 years and wanted to try a new crop.

We
knew about wasabi and wanted to try it when we discovered that the 
paste and powder that you buy in shops has less than 15 per cent of 
actual wasabi in it.

'It was difficult to research how to grow it because no one has been successful in Europe before so we tried different methods.

'We
practised and came up with our own system based on the sawa method used
in Japan, which is where the wasabi is grown in water on gravel.

'I
think it could take off as a product that individual people will want 
to buy as the interest in Japanese food and sushi is steadily gaining 
popularity.

'It could even 
be grown personally in back gardens in the future, not only does it have
a distinct flavour but the plant is quite pretty too,' the farmer 
added.
