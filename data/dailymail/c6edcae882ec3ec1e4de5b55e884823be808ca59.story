A baby who had a heart attack 48 hours after being born and faced never walking or talking has finally returned home to join his twin brother.

Joshua Arndt-Skyrme had been out of hospital less than 24 hours when mother Jaime Arndt, 25, noticed he was grunting unusually and took him back to A&E where he went into cardiac arrest.

While his twin Charlie was thriving at home in Leominster, Herefordshire, Joshua spent two months in hospital fighting a life-threatening infection and meningitis when doctors gave his parents the grim warning that he might never wake up.

Back home: Jaime Arndt, 25, from Leominster, Herefordshire, and her baby Joshua who suffered a heart attack

Jaime Arndt rushed Joshua to hospital where he had a heart attack and his condition deteriorated even further and he began to have constant seizures

But Charlie visited him in his hospital cot for 'twin time' every day and now he's returned home and his parents count themselves lucky to finally be changing double the number of nappies.

When non-identical twins Joshua and Charlie were born weighing 6lb 1oz and 5lb 3oz on March 28 Jaime's biggest worry was how she was going to manage a double buggy.

It was only when first born twin Joshua started making grunting noises at just two days old that Jaime started having other concerns.

She rushed him to hospital where he had a heart attack and his condition deteriorated even further and he began to have constant seizures.

He was diagnosed with Group B Strep - a normally harmless bacteria found in 25 per cent of humans that, if passed onto babies during labour, can have terrible consequences.

The newborn spent three and a half weeks in intensive care and parents Jaime and Lee were told he was unlikely to survive and were given the chance to take him off the ventilator keeping him alive.

Three weeks after his heart attack Joshua had started breathing independently and within two months he was back at home like any other baby

Doctors warned that even if he did wake up it was possible he would never be able to walk, talk or move.

But just three weeks later Joshua had started breathing independently and within two months he was back at home like any other baby.

His hearing is perfect and now his family are waiting on other tests to confirm that he hasn't been affected in any other way.

Jaime said: 'When they were born I was worried about changing all the nappies and the sleepless nights but now I couldn't be happier to be doing it'

Now Jaime and her family are fundraising for Birmingham Children's Hospital where Joshua was treated and campaigning for all pregnant women to be offered the test for Group B Strep.

If a simple test in the final weeks of pregnancy proves positive for the bacteria, antibiotics during labour can minimise the chances of babies developing the infection.

In the UK, the test is currently only recommended for mothers deemed at specific risk but 40 per cent of cases develop where there are no known risk factors.

Alright now: Joshua is back home where he belongs with his family

Jaime said: 'I'm just overjoyed that the twins are back together.

'When they were born I was worried about changing all the nappies and the sleepless nights but now I couldn't be happier to be doing it.

'The simple things mean a lot now!

'When they asked if we wanted to turn the life support off we knew it was touch and go.

'But he just needed a bit more time and he was such a fighter he was soon munching on the tube trying to breath for himself.

'The doctors really didn't know what his chances were. It's more common for babies who have been through what Josh has not to make it.

'So the fact that he's here with us and his hearing hasn't been affected at all in incredible. He's doing more every day.

'One of the best things is having us all together as a family and the boys back together.

'You can tell they know they've been reunited. They're more settled when they're together. Although they had 'twin time' during Joshua's hospitalisation when Charlie went to sit in his cot for a bit each day it wasn't the same.

'Now they cuddle up and they've always got one body part touching the other. Them having that time together in hospital must have helped him through.

'I'd definitely tell pregnant women to get the test for Group B Strep done.

'If we'd have known about it before Josh was born it would have prevented everything. It's heart-breaking to know that other parents could be in the same situation as us but not be so lucky when it could have been prevented.'
