A Russian thrill-seeker has taken sofa surfing to a whole new level after a video showed him being dragged along behind his car while sitting in his armchair.

Alexander Shapovalov claimed he had been planning to take the old chair to the rubbish tip but could not fit it into his car.

So the 23-year-old decided on a novel mode of transport instead-  tying the armchair to the back of his car and jumping on it for the ride.

Thrill-seeking in comfort: Alexander Shapovalov took a trip around town in an armchair tied attached to the back of car 

Russian police are now investigating the video and have warned they are considering bringing charges against him. 

The video, shot by Shapovalov and his friends, show the adrenalin junkie sitting in the chair as it is dragged down the frozen streets of Krasnoyarsk in central Russia's Krasnoyarsk Krai region, behind the Subaru Forester.

After spotting a car park where there were other young car drivers trying out drifting techniques, he and his friends decided to join in complete with armchair.

Sparks fly from underneath the armchair as it speeds along, attached by rope to the Subaru Forester 

The group filmed Shapovalov being dragged in the armchair behind his drifting car and at one point turning over, sending him skidding across the road.

Travelling at considerable speed, sparks can even be seen flying from underneath the piece of furniture.

Shapovalov, who escaped the tumble unhurt, said: 'I  decided to tie (the armchair) up behind my car and drag it there with one of my friends driving, and as it was on the road anyway I decided to sit on it.

'It was always comfortable but I never knew it could also be so much fun.' 

After several others had also tried surfing with the armchair, the friends are finally seen dragging it to the tip. There, Shapovalov said a fond farewell to his faithful piece of furniture with a goodbye kiss.
