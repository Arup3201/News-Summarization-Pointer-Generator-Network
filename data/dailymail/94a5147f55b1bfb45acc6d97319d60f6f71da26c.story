Serial offender: Edwin Alemany, 28, has a rap sheet 52 charges long

Police have named a 'person of interest' in the horrific kidnapping and murder of a 24-year-old woman in South Boston last week - and even the Boston police commission admits he never should have been on the streets. 

Boston Commissioner Ed revealed on Saturday that Edwin Alemany attempted another attack on a woman in a South Boston park last September but was never arrested, even though the victim managed to grab his wallet and ID and hand it to detectives. 

Alemany, a 28-year-old serial offender with a record of 52 charges
against him, has not yet been charged with abduction and stabbing Amy 
Lord last week. He is currently in jail, facing charges from two similar
attacks on women in the same neighborhood that took place just days 
after Miss Lord was killed.

Miss Lord was kidnapped outside her 
home at 6am when she stepped out Tuesday. She was held hostage for 19 
hours and driven to five ATMs, where she was made to withdraw money. She
was then brutally stabbed to death and her body dumped in a park. 

'It's
incredibly frustrating that we're here today talking about a man that 
has 18 juvenile arraignments and 34 adult arraignments and is still not 
incarcerated,' Davis said, according to Fox Boston.

Davis
revealed that on September 28, a 21-year-old woman was attacked by 
Alemany in a park at 2am. He grabbed her around the throat and attempted
to strangle her, but she fought back.

Tragic: The murder of Amy Lord, 24, has shocked her South Boston neighborhood. She was leaving her house at 6am to workout when she was abducted off the street

In the struggle, the woman managed to grab Alemany's wallet and ID card before he fled.

She
handed that evidence over to detectives. Despite the key evidence, 
Boston police never moved in to arrest Alemany or charge him with the 
crime - which could have put him in prison for many years.

Davis said a review of the police department's case from the 2012 attack reveals that detectives had enough evidence against the serial offender.

Boston Mayor Thomas Menino told the Boston Herald he was outraged by the failure of police to lock up Alemany before he could strike again.

'My thoughts were, "My God, why?" The system broke down and that system can’t break down when there’s an investigation of a person who committed a crime of such magnitude,' he said.

Lord's body was found at Hyde Park's Stony Brook Reservation on Tuesday. She had been stabbed to death

Davis said he and the commanders of the police department's investigative bureaus would conduct a review of past cases to see whether any other incidents like Alemany's alleged 2012 attack had slipped through the cracks.

Alemany has been in and out of prison for years and may have been staying with a friend - illegally - at a South Boston public housing complex nearby.

Alemany allegedly attacked two other women in the same neighborhood, as well. One attack was reported at 5am on Tuesday - one hour before the abduction of Miss Lord.

The second attack took place about 12.10am on Thursday. Both escaped with minor injuries.

The murder of Amy Lord - a high school cheerleader and Bentley University graduate - has shocked the neighborhood - resulting in candle-light vigils attended by hundreds and community meetings about neighborhood safety.
