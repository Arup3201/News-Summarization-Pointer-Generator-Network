A British singer and her husband have been fired from their roles as judges on New Zealand’s X Factor after humiliating a contestant by launching a tirade that the show’s boss slammed as ‘completely unacceptable’.

Natalia Kills, from Bradford, and her New Zealander husband Willy Moon, mocked aspiring singer Joe Irvine after he performed in a live show on Sunday.

Kills, 28, accused Irvine, who sang Cry Me A River, of copying her husband’s look of gelled-back hair and a suit. 

Sacked: Married X Factor New Zealand judges Natalia Kills and Willy Moon have been fired after launching a tirade of abuse at contestant, Joe Irvine, on Sunday night's episode

Holding back the tears: Joe Irvine, an aspiring singer, was verbally attacked by the British singer/songwriter and her husband on live television following his rendition of Cry Me A River

She said: 'Ladies and gentlemen, I'm just going to state the obvious, we have a doppelgänger in our midst.

'As an artist who respects creative integrity and intellectual property, I am disgusted at how much you've copied my husband.

'From the hair to the suit, do you not have any value for respect for originality?' alluding to the fact that Moon has copyright over wearing suits and gelling his hair back.

She added: ‘You're a laughing stock. It's cheesy, it's disgusting, I personally found it artistically atrocious.

'I am embarrassed to be sitting here in your presence having to even dignify you with an answer of my opinion.'

A shocked Irvine retorted: ‘Don’t you copy Cleopatra?’

In the spotlight: Kills accused the aspiring singer of copying her husband's look, seemingly unaware of the fact that slicked-back hair and a suit were hardly original

Double whammy: Moon, 25, stepped in to back up his 28-year-old wifer, and compared Irvine to Psycho character, Norman Bates, asking him whether he dressed up in his mother's clothing

Hubris: Kills said Irvine was 'a laughing stock'. 'It's cheesy, it's disgusting', she said. But it was Kills herself and her husband that ended up being fired

You're killing me: Despite the shocking humiliation, Irvine reacted with a smile and attempted to shake the criticism off, asking Kills, 'don't you copy Cleopatra?'

Kills and Moon had earlier caused controversy when they repeatedly called a mother from Auckland the C-word following an argument over a parking space, then refused to apologise.

Tracey Neal-Gailer, 51, described how Moon used the abusive term last Tuesday after he reprimanded her for taking a bakery parking space he believed was his in the Auckland suburb of Kingsland.

She told The New Zealand Herald: ‘He was a passenger in a car being driven by a woman and he became very upset when I pulled into a space before him, even though I had the right of way.

‘He got out of the car and was waving his finger at me and saying, “No, no, no.” He then snarled, “That was so rude” as we both went into the bakery.’

She said that once they were inside the bakery, with children nearby, Moon twice hissed ‘you are such a c***’.

The Herald published a letter that Ms Neal-Gailer wrote to Moon in which she voiced her disgust at his insult.

But Moon told the newspaper: ‘I seem to recall someone was behaving like a c*** and getting called a c***. It's as simple as that.’

In a tweet directed at The Herald he repeated the abuse and also disputed the accuracy of Ms Neal-Gailer’s letter, writing ‘not only a **** but a lying **** judging from that "statement" you [The Herald] saw fit to print. Laughable. Bored?’

Kills also used the C-word in a tweet to describe Ms Neal-Gailer, it was reported, in which she disputed that children had been within earshot of the swearing.

She wrote: ‘Hilarious that lady is proving not only how much of a c*** she is, but also a lying c***! 'Children present'?! Where?!’

X Factor producers TV3 apologised to Ms Neal-Gailer on the pair’s behalf. 

Then Moon, 25, stepped in to back up his 28-year-old wife, and compared Irvine to Psycho character, Norman Bates.

He said: 'To me it feels just a little bit cheap and absurd. It's like Norman Bates dressing up in his mother's clothing, it feels a little creepy and I feel like you are going to stitch someone's skin to your face and then kill everybody in the audience.'

Kills continued: 'It's absolutely disgusting... you make me sick. You have no identity... I am ashamed to be here.'

Irvine appeared to take the abuse in his stride and said ‘I think I look really good’.

Despite Moon having a look that resembles other more famous singers such as Mark Ronson, Olly Murs and Michael Bublé, Kills replied: ‘You look good because you're dressed as my husband.’

Both their comments were roundly booed by the audience. 

And fellow judge Melanie Blatt, the former All Saints singer, defended Irvine. She told him: ‘Actually, you're dressed better than her husband.’

Mark Weldon, chief executive of MediaWorks, which owns and operates TV3 - the channel that broadcasts the show - said on Monday afternoon the pair would no longer be welcome on the hit reality show.

'Last night on X Factor both Kills and Moon made comments that were completely unacceptable,' he said.

'While the judges on X Factor are expected to provide critiques of the performances, we will not tolerate such destructive tirades from any of the judges.

'Contestants put their all into this competition and they should expect to receive feedback and criticism that is professional and constructive.

'We no longer have confidence that Kills and Moon are the right people to perform the role of X Factor judges and they will leave the show, effective immediately.’

Two new judges are said to replace Moon and Kills next week, while Blatt and fellow judge Stan Walker will take over on Monday night.

A Facebook group called 'Fire Natalia Kills from X Factor NZ' was created after the show, amassing over 57,500 followers, while a petition demanding the same thing gathered 74,000 signatures.

Afterwards Blatt took to Twitter to slam Kills. She wrote: 'Ive tried to keep my cool and stay professional but really @nataliakills ? Sorry love , you're a t**t.'

Kills and Moon had earlier caused controversy when they repeatedly called a mother from Auckland the C-word following an argument over a parking space, then refused to apologise.

Water off a duck's back... Kills tweeted shortly after the show, seemingly unfazed by the petitions and Facebook groups calling for her to be fired

Not happy: People tweeted in their droves about their disgust at Kills and Moon's comments

Not happy: Fans aired their grievances about the insults that were hurled by the pair of judges

You're a t**t!' Fellow judge and former All Saints member Melanie Blatt attacked Kills on social media

Outraged: Blatt could no longer keep her cool and took to her own social media account to speak out about the televised humiliation

Replaced: Two new judges are said to replace Moon and Kills next week, while Blatt and fellow host Stan Walker will take over on Monday night

Tracey Neal-Gailer, 51, described how Moon used the abusive term last Tuesday after he reprimanded her for taking a bakery parking space he believed was his in the Auckland suburb of Kingsland.
