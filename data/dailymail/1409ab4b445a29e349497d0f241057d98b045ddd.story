Manchester City's squad have flown to Dundee ahead of their Scottish pre-season tour - with unsettled striker Alvaro Negredo in good spirits as he boarded the plane.

Manuel Pellegrini's side will play Dundee on Sunday before travelling to Edinburgh to face Hearts the following Friday.

And Negredo, who has been linked with a move away from the Etihad, was pictured boarding the private 'City Jet' on Wednesday evening, with new goalkeeper Willy Caballero also in tow.

They then face Arsenal in the Community Shield on August 10 before beginning their title defence with a trip to face Newcastle at St James Park.
