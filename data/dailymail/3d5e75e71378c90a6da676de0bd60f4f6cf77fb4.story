People up in arms over a Florida high school named after the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan are working to get the name changed.

Previous attempts to rename Nathan Bedford Forrest High School, in Jacksonville, were unsuccessful, but officials have begun looking into a name change after the father of a district student started a petition and has said he will not allow his daughter to attend the school.

Omotayo Richmond’s Change.org petition has well over 100,000 signatures, but the Duval County Public School district has said it will have no impact on the high school’s name.

The first Grand Wizard: Nathaniel Bedford Forrest was head of the KKK from 1866 until 1869

Mr Richmond’s daughter attend the district, the African-American told ABC News he will not allow her to set foot inside a school named after a famously notorious racist.

‘It just wouldn’t happen,’ Mr Richmond said. ‘I believe it’s outrageous that this could even be questioned by anybody… that anybody could even come to the defense of this man.’

He’s not alone, the more than 160,000 people who signed his online petition come from all over the country.

‘I am very encouraged that [people] chose to support this cause and I am humbled by that and excited for change,’ he continued.

Sentiment clearly supports a change, but there is a catch. 

A DCPS spokesperson told ABC the district will only listen to a name change request originating from within its boundaries – where Mr Richmond lives, and that the final decision will be made by school board members.

Honoring a racist: Nathaniel Bedford Forrest High School was named after the former KKK leader, but residents want that to change

A previous attempt to change the school’s name have somehow failed. 

Despite a 2007 Florida State College 
study that received an overwhelming number of responses in favour of 
changing the school’s name, the school board voted against changing the 
school’s name, according to ABC.

The vote had two African-Americans in favor of changing the name, but five whites voted against the idea.

The city of Memphis, TN., earlier this year voted to rename a park 
named after the Mr Forrest, who also was a general in the Confederate 
Army during the Civil War.

The KKK marched on the city, with a 
local leader claiming 'the Memphis City Council is basically trying to 
eradicate white people out of the history books across America.'

Lance Stoll, the college professor who headed up the 2007 effort, is spearheading this one as well. He believes this time the name will change.

‘We don’t want 60 percent of the kids, black kids going to a school named for somebody who would’ve killed them and enslaved them if he had the chance,’ Mr Stoll told ABC.

Over 90 per cent of respondents in just under 2,000 door to door surveys conducted by Mr Stoll’s Jacksonville Progressive Coalition have responded in favour of changing the school’s name, ABC noted.

A further 36 people showed up to last week’s school board meeting advocating to change the name, according to ABC.

Some did speak in favour of the name remaining, arguing for Mr Forrest’s place in history.

‘Forrest, the man, and his association with the KKK is history,’ 1979 graduate Alison Barwick said, according to ABC. ‘The KKK’s function was much different in his time than it is now.’

‘I think you’d be hard pressed to find any Southern gentleman from that era that didn’t have some association with the Klan,’ she added.

Despite further arguing by Ms Barwick that the school has very little money for band and drama programs, the school board voted unanimously to move forward with the process.

The drawn out plan involves gathering info from many groups, including current and former students, the PTA and many more.

It is unlikely a vote will be held this year, a spokesperson told ABC.
