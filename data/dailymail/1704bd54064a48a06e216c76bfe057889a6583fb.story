There's a new must-have shoe on the red carpet these days, and it has nothing to do with red soles.

The Lana heels, from small London label Bionda Castana, haves been seen on everyone from Zoe Saldana and Anna Paquin to Emma Roberts and Eva Mendes in recent months.

The list doesn't end there. Kate Bosworth wore them to the launch of her Style Thief app, Olivia Palermo for her Brides magazine cover shoot, and Cheryl Cole for her birthday in June.

A-listers' choice: With its pointed toe and ankle tie, the £485 ($800) pump is certainly versatile, and the fact that it comes in multiple colourways has made it a popular choice with celebrity stylists

Lizzy Caplan, Gemma Arterton and Zoey Deutch have also been pictured out and about in their Lanas.

Indeed, for the coolest Hollywood starlets, it has become almost de rigueur to be seen sporting a pair.

With its pointed toe and ankle tie, the £485 ($800) pump is certainly versatile, and the fact that it comes in multiple colourways has made it a popular choice with celebrity stylists. 

The label was founded by friends Natalia Barbieri and Jennifer Portman who bonded over their shared Italian heritage. The name Bionda Castana means Blonde (Jennifer) Brunette (Natalia) in Italian. Their shoes are designed in London and made by hand in Italy

Natalia tells MailOnline that the Lana pumps were designed with Lana del Rey in mind, calling the singer 'the epitome of cool'.

She believes the style has been as successful as it is because it is classic without being too understated.

'Lana is our take on the classic single sole pump,' she said. 'This particular shape and style is very on trend. It is not 'plain' yet works in the same capacity as a 'plain' pump would with added cool.'

And, she promises, the Lana heels are comfortable too.

'The fabrication of the style is popular because it is breathable,' she explained.

'Epitome of cool': The Lana shoe was inspired by singer Lana Del Rey

'When wearing heels, our feet naturally swell, but the soft mesh at the front of the toes keeps our feet comfortable and this style doesn't rub in the same way a leather-lined pump would in warm weather and after long wear.'

The graphic triangle motif, Natalia adds, is inspired by modern architecture, 'but [we] take it to a feminine level as opposed to taking it the other way which would be heavy, chunky, eccentric.' 

The Bionda Castana celebrity love doesn't end at Lana. Countless other Hollywood feet have been seen in other designs.

Rachel Bilson, for example, has worn her Rosario shoes on the red carpet. Jennifer Lopez, Amanda Seyfried, Kerry Washington and Sophia Bush have all been seen in the Daphne Bis style and Alexa Chung can't stop wearing her Nicole heels.

Lea Michele wears the Rosario, Elisabeth Moss has stepped out in the Renee and Rosario Dawson wore the Elisabetta earlier this year.  

Bionda Castana isn't the only emerging new footwear label to have generated industry attention of late. Over the past couple of seasons, three others have been making waves among fashion editors. Here are the names you need to know:

Dazzling: Mo Helmi's Lupe boot, £445, Mohelmi.com

Mo Helmi 

The London-based designer is a new name on the footwear scene, but he looks set to become a familiar one. 

Helmi's shoes are made in the same Italian factory as Dolce & Gabbana, Bottega Veneta and Jimmy Choo and is run by three generations of the same family.

And it seems his visits cause quite a spectacle - he told MailOnline: 'I make the fitting models run across the factory floor to check if they are comfortable but still hold on firm to the feet. I always say to them, "Pretend you are running late for a show, or after a taxi!"

A favorite from his newest collection is the dazzling navy suede and navy/purple glitter Lupe boot, pictured right. 

 

 

'Sexy without severity': Paul Andrew's Zenadia pump, $675, Shopbop.com

Paul Andrew 

Paul Andrew cut his teeth working at labels including Donna Karan, Calvin Klein, Alexander McQueen and Narciso Rodriguez. The British-born, U.S.-based designer launched his eponymous collection last year and was named that year's ‘Launch of the Year’ by Footwear News.

His aesthetic is 'sexy without severity' and the result is uncompromised luxury. 

Celebrity fans include Keira Knightley, Anna Chlumsky, Poppy Delevingne and Laura Bailey.

 

 

Colourful: Sophia Webster Riko cut-out patent leather sandals, £525, net-a-porter.com

Sophia Webster 

Sophia Webster's graphic, colourful designs have been described by J. Crew's Jenna Lyons as 'a beautiful world for your feet to spend the day in.'

The former assistant to Nicholas Kirkwood launched her first collection in 2012 and quickly started winning accolades including the Emerging Talent Award for Accessories at the British Fashion Awards in 2013. She was also a British Fashion Council New Gen Award Winner for both seasons that year.

This year, Lyons' love of Webster's designs became a J. Crew collaboration, dramatically raising her profile in the U.S.
