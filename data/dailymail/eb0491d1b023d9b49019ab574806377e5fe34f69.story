Cesc Fabregas didn't waste time in getting back to London after Chelsea's 1-1 draw against Manchester City on Sunday as he dined out with girlfriend Daniella Semaan.

The Spanish midfielder played the full 90 minutes for Jose Mourinho's side as former Chelsea star Frank Lampard cancelled out an Andre Schurrle opener at the Etihad.

Fabregas was spotted leaving popular Cantonese restaurant Hakkasan in Mayfair and sparked engagement rumours as Semaan was sporting a large diamond ring.

The couple - who have 17-month-old daughter Lia together - have also reportedly been seen shopping for engagement rings.

Fabregas has made a stunning start to his Blues career, already bagging four assists as well as his first competitive goal in a Chelsea shirt during his team's 1-1 Champions League draw against Schalke last week. 

The midfielder's form will no doubt have had Arsenal fans wondering why Fabregas didn't return to the Gunners this summer.

Addressing that issue, Fabregas told The Sun on Sunday: 'I can understand some people at Arsenal are sad, some people are upset, some people are even angry.

'But changing clubs is part of the game and people must remember it was Arsenal who didn't take up the buy-back option for me.

'So what am I going to do - retire? No way!

'I have to look after myself. I had to make a decision.'
