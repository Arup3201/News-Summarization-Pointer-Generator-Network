Marilyn Monroe's handwritten letter is expected to sell for more than £30,000

Marilyn Monroe wrote of her despair and that she believed she was going 'crazy' in a letter to her acting mentor.

The star, who died from an overdose of barbiturates, told acting coach Lee Strasberg about the struggles in front of the camera.

The handwritten letter is expected to sell for up to £33,000 and is part of a collection of rare historical documents that are being sold in an online auction.

Among the lots are a series of heartfelt missives from General Dwight D. Eisenhower to his wife Mamie during the Second World War and a typed letter from John Lennon to Paul McCartney.

Monroe's undated letter was written on Hotel Bel-Air letterhead stationery.

She wrote: 'My will is weak but I can't stand anything. I sound crazy but I think I'm going crazy.

'It's just that I get before a camera and 
my concentration and everything I'm trying to learn leaves me. Then I 
feel like I'm not existing in the human race at all.'

The letter will go on sale in the May 30 auction for between £20,000 and £30,000.

Monroe turned to Strasberg, known as the 'father of method acting in America' at the height of her career to broaden her range.

Her letter is among 250 documents 
being sold by an anonymous American collector.

Selected items will be 
exhibited April 8-16 at Douglas Elliman's Madison Avenue art gallery.

The
58 Eisenhower letters, handwritten between 1942 and 1945, range from 
news of the war to the Allied commander's devotion to his wife, Mamie.

They are believed to be among the largest group of Eisenhower letters to
survive intact and could bring up to £80,000 said Joseph Maddalena, 
whose Profiles in History is auctioning the items.

Also included is a typed, undated draft letter from John Lennon to Linda and Paul McCartney that reflects the deep animosity between the two Beatles around the time of the foursome's formal 1971 breakup.

The two-page letter is unsigned and 
contains corrections. A photographic logo on the stationery shows Lennon
and his wife Yoko Ono within a circle with their lips almost touching.

In the letter, addressed to Paul and his wife Linda, he wrote: 'Do you really think most of today's art came about because of the Beatles? I don't believe you're that insane - Paul - do you believe that? When you stop believing it you might wake up!'

It is expected to fetch up to £40,000.

Other highlights in the sale include two large photo albums that Adolph Hitler and Benito Mussolini exchanged prior to War World II.

Mr Maddalena said: 'When Mussolini and Hitler visited 
each other before the war, they would each have their photographers 
document their trips.

The letters between General Dwight D. Eisenhower and wife Mamie, pictured together in 1945, are expected to sell for £79,000

'They really documented the 
regalia, the flags, the uniforms, tanks and all the pomp and 
circumstance, and them speaking and reviewing the troops.'

The leather-bound albums, containing hundreds of images, have a pre-sale estimate of up to £33,000.

The sale is the second of several planned online auctions of the anonymous collector's artifacts. The entire collection contains 3,000 items.
