A 29-year-old gas station clerk who  thwarted a robbery by pulling out a handgun was fired for violating his company's 'no firearms' policy.

Shannon 'Bear' Cothran was working alone at a New Hampshire Shell outlet when he was threatened by a knife-wielding man demanding money about 3am yesterday.

When Cothran pulled out his Ruger LCP .380 handgun, the masked would-be thief fled the Nashua station and is on the run from police.

Cothran said he had just finished serving a customer when the would-be robber approached him.

'He had the knife cocked back. It looked
like he was going to stab me,' Cothran told Nashua Telegraph.

'I took several steps 
back, produced my sidearm, and informed him it was a bad idea and he 
didn’t want to do it, and he left.'

While Cothran said the move saved his life and the company's money, his employer didn't see it that way.

He was fired a few hours after reporting the incident to Nouria Energy, which owns the station.

Even
though Cothran's store and district managers lobbied to save his job, 
Nouria stood by its policy to prohibit weapons in the workplace 'to keep
employees and customers safe'.

Cothran had worked at various Nouria Energy convenience stores for 10 years and was aware of the policy, but said he didn't regret his actions.

'I have a fiancee who I love very much, step-children I love, our first grandchild is due in December,' Cothran told Nashua Patch.

'Given
the situation, and the way the man who tried to rob me was acting, I 
truly believe if I didn't defend myself I wasn't going to be coming home
to see my family.'

The Milford resident said he'd obtained his gun license eight years ago when he was 21 and started taking a gun to work about two years ago.

He said he'd feared for his safety working night shift in a city that reportedly had 20 armed robberies in the past few months, most all of them at convenience stores, Nashua Patch reported.

Now out of a job, Cothran said he hopes the company 'rethinks its policy' of prohibiting weapons.

'My one hope for all of this is that 
they rethink their policy about not permitting cashiers to protect 
themselves. I realize it's a liability for the company,' he told Nashua Telegraph.

'But I'm hoping they rethink their policy
of letting employees who are licensed to carry concealed weapons do so.
I hope they look at this and realize there was no monetary loss to the 
store, no injuries and that because I am a reasonable human being and a 
responsible gun owner, they benefited.'

Scene: This is the Shell gas station at 301 Main St. in Nashua, New Hampshire, where Shannon Cothran halted a robbery

Cothran, a former bouncer, stands by his decision to protect himself. 

'I can find another job. A paycheck’s a paycheck. I don’t really care where it comes from,' he told Nashua Patch.

'I cannot justify in my mind trying to save my job at the risk of not ever seeing my family and friends again.'

Meanwhile, Nashua police Lt. Denis Linehan has backed Cothran's pro-gun sentiments, telling Nashua Telegraph it appeared the clerk took 'appropriate action'.

'In this situation, the clerk was 
presented with a deadly weapon. He was in close proximity to the suspect
when the deadly weapon was displayed to him' he said.

'The clerk, from the 
information I have, took the appropriate action in terms of how he felt 
threatened, in presenting the firearm.'

Meanwhile, Nashua police are hunting 
the armed would-be robber, described as a white or Hispanic, between 6 
feet and 6 feet, 2 inches tall, with a medium build.

They also recovered a piece of evidence – a black-and-gray Coleman 
jacket with a red collar - which the suspect discarded while he was 
running from the scene.
