Jessica Ashton-Pyatt suffered two heart attacks after she vomited so violently her stomach ruptured in October last year

A teenager died after being admitted to a ‘chaotic’ casualty ward where nurses tried to use a vital piece of equipment upside down, an inquest heard.

Jessica Ashton-Pyatt, 14, suffered two heart attacks after she vomited so violently that her stomach ruptured.

Gravely ill, she was taken to scandal-hit Pilgrim Hospital in Boston, Lincolnshire.

But while a registrar and ambulance staff desperately tried to resuscitate her, two male nurses looked on, apparently ‘terrified’ and ‘overwhelmed’ by the situation.

One of the nurses, a coroner was told, tried to use a so-called bone gun the wrong way to connect an intravenous drip. Instead of pointing the gun at Jessica’s leg, he pointed it directly at a doctor.

There was also a vital delay because a defibrillator was not fully charged, while a subsequent investigation found that the A&E team lacked proper leadership.

The hospital is run by the United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust (ULHT), which was recently put into special measures after being identified as one of a number of Trusts with an excessive number of patient deaths.

Although the hearing in Boston was told that Jessica’s treatment did not play a role in her death, the Trust has apologised, saying ‘aspects of care’ did not meet the ‘high standards that we normally deliver’.

Parents Nicola, 33, and 34-year-old Andy, from Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, are now considering legal action.

The inquest on Friday also heard that Jessica (pictured) had suffered catastrophic injuries as a result of the mystery illness and little could have been done to save her

Mother Nicola Pyatt (pictured) said: 'I am disgusted and angry at the way staff at the hospital treated Jessica. 
Some of the staff were told to help with her resuscitation, and they stood by and watched like it was some sort of show'

Following the hearing, Mrs Pyatt 
said: ‘I am disgusted and angry at the way staff at the hospital treated
Jessica. Some of the staff were told to help with her resuscitation, 
and they stood by and watched like it was some sort of show.

Despite Jessica's inconsistent care, the coroner recorded a verdict of death by natural causes

‘We went to the inquest in the hope we can get closure on our daughter’s death, but now we have even more questions.’

Jessica was rushed to hospital last 
October after suffering severe stomach pains on holiday at Butlins in 
Skegness, Lincolnshire, with a friend and the friend’s mother.

By the time an ambulance arrived the teenager was vomiting blood from a ruptured stomach and she died hours later.

Mark
Hall, a paramedic who administered CPR at the hospital, told the 
hearing that two of the resuscitation team – described as possibly of 
Indian origin – failed to get involved.

One
of them, he said, used the bone gun – which allows fluids and medicines
to be introduced via bone marrow rather than a vein – in an ‘alarming 
manner’ by attempting to put it in upside down. ‘I would describe it as chaos,’ said Mr Hall. ‘In my opinion they appeared overwhelmed by the serious situation.’

Friday’s hearing was told Jessica would not have survived the irreparable stomach condition.Pathologist Dr Stuart Hamilton said he was ‘baffled’ as to what had caused the ruptured stomach.

South
Lincolnshire Coroner Prof Robert Forrest, who recorded a verdict of 
death through natural causes, said: ‘The treatment she received did not 
save her life but did not contribute to her death.’

The coroner said he would raise some of the issues highlighted at the inquest with the chief executive of the hospital trust.

United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust, which runs Pilgrim Hospital (pictured), issued a statement apologising for failings in Jessica¿s care. They said: 'We express our sincere condolences to the family of Jessica Ashton-Pyatt and apologise for any distress caused during her treatment'

ULHT said that following an 
investigation, medical staff must now ‘escalate cases to a consultant 
when required’, while equipment is also checked thoroughly after use.

In
2011, the Nursing and Midwifery Council ordered trainee nurses out of 
the Pilgrim Hospital after serious concerns were raised about the 
quality of training.

Earlier
this year, Gary Walker, the ULHT’s former chief executive, broke a 
gagging order to accuse Sir David Nicholson, the NHS chief executive, of
ignoring his warnings in 2009 that patient safety was being compromised
by the drive to hit government targets.

She was rushed to Pilgrim Hospital in nearby Boston, but died hours later

Inquest heard A&E staff were ‘overwhelmed’ when Jessica was admitted

This led to a catalogue of errors including a situation where a defibrillator could not be used because it was left unplugged by staff

Verdict of death by natural causes was recorded by the coroner, however
