A crowd of up to 70,000 people took to the streets in Syria yesterday in an unprecedented show of defiance against President Bashar Assad’s embattled regime.

Emboldened by an Arab peace-monitoring group’s first tour of the flashpoint city of Homs, protesters broke cover in a bid to win more international support for the popular revolt.

The Arab League observers want to determine if Assad is keeping his promise to implement a peace plan to end his violent nine-month crackdown that has claimed as many as 5,000 victims.

Yesterday the army reportedly killed at least 42 people in the city that
has become a focal point of the uprising against President Bashar 
al-Assad

Withdraw: According to those opposed to President Assad's regime the army withdrew tanks tanks from the city to coincide with the arrival of a team of Arab League observers

Their arrival in Homs yesterday marked a break in hostilities and an opportunity for a public protest.

Tens of thousands tried to enter the tightly-secured Clock Square but were beaten back by security forces firing tear gas and live bullets, according to human rights groups.

Anti-government activists fear Assad is trying to fool the observers by preventing them from visiting the worst hit areas and temporarily withdrawing troops from parts of the city.

Protesters claimed that a dozen tanks were seen leaving one hotspot hours before the monitors turned up, while others were being hidden in government buildings to create a false impression of relative normality while the city tour was going on.

At the end of the first day of the month-long series of Arab League visits, two very different views emerged as to the success of the mission.

Sudan’s General Mustafa Dabi, the head of the observers, insisted last night: ‘Today was very good and all sides were very responsive.’

But video footage showed Homs residents pleading unsuccessfully with monitors to venture further into the Baba Amr quarter, where clashes have been especially fierce.

Gunshots crackled nearby as two monitors and two men wearing orange vests stood amid a crowd of residents, one begging the team to ‘come and see – they are slaughtering us, I swear.’

Residents in the video were seen shouting: ‘We want universal protection’ and ‘Where is the world?’ 

Abdul Omar, a spokesman for the London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, accused the government of playing cat-and-mouse with demonstrators by pulling tanks out of the city. There were also reports that security forces changed clothes to make them appear like civilians.

According to the human rights group, seven people were shot dead yesterday (TUE). Opposition group the LCC put the figure at 30, including six in Homs.

There were signs of intimidation towards the observers, too. According to the New York Times, a group from the Sudan, Egypt, Algeria and Mauritania were held back by gunfire coming from a government checkpoint as they tried to visit a mosque where several bodies of victims were being stored.

‘The observers failed today,’ said Ali, an opposition activist who complained the 60 visitors didn’t see the field hospitals or the ‘hot spots.’

After signing on to the Arab League plan early last week, Assad’s regime had only intensified the violence, rather than easing up, and it was condemned internationally for flouting the agreement. Government troops killed hundreds in the past week.

On Monday, security forces killed at least 42 people, most of them in Homs.

Teams of observers are also supposed to travel to several other cities, but critics have questioned how effective the mission will be in coming up with an independent judgment in what is increasingly looking like a civil war.
