Helicopters are used to airlifting precious cargo to safety but nothing could have prepared the crew for transporting this heavy load.

A four tonne white rhino needed to be transferred to a different enclosure in the Zululand region of Kwa-Zulu Natal in South Africa so the animal was airlifted using a harness.

Em Gatland captured the moment the rhino was lifted up by the helicopter in a programme by KZN Wildlife Ezemvelo Game Capture.

Conservationists relocate pairs of rhinos every year in the hope of ensuring the strength of future blood lines in the animals. The location of their new home has not been revealed so the animals can be kept safe

The photographer said: 'Taking pictures of the rhino was a surreal feeling and a mixture of emotion.

'With the current rhino crisis, to be so up close and personal to the prehistoric creature was a breath-taking experience.'

Rhinos in that area of South Africa are relocated in pairs every year for the benefit of the species and in order to ensure the strength of future bloodlines.

But the location they are moved to is kept secret, to keep the animals safe.

The rhino was first darted with anaesthetic in order for the animal conservationists to undertake the mammoth task of securing the rhino so it could be safely airlifted to its new home.

Ms Gatland added: 'Airlifting the rhino was a big team operation and the biggest difficulty for me was manoeuvring in-between people to get a good picture of the rhino.

'I didn't want to get in the way of the people working to get the massive mammal airlifted but I'm glad I managed to get some good shots.

'It was a very moving and emotional moment and a completely new experience for me. To be up so close and personal to a prehistoric creature is a breath taking experience.

The rhino will now be closely monitored for five weeks to make sure it is happy in its new environment

'I became emotionally aware of how vulnerable they really are. It was a humbling experience to say the least and I couldn't but feel a completely overwhelming desperation for the precious creature.

'There is an element of danger as I was in a Big 5 reserve in complete wilderness and I needed to have my wits about me.

'It really gave me a feeling of perspective in this world.'
