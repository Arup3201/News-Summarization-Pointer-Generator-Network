Alastair Cook admitted he had never felt under more pressure after hitting 95 as England reached an imposing 247 for two on the first day of the third Investec Test against India in Southampton.

The England captain had not reached 30 since December and came within five runs of a cathartic first Test hundred in 28 innings before being caught behind off spinner Ravindra Jadeja.

‘If you’d sat here talking to me yesterday and offered me 95, I would have snapped your hand off,’ said Cook.

‘You’ll never silence everyone, that’s
 the nature of the beast. But what it’s done for me is given me 
confidence that my batting is going in the right direction again.

‘The
 most pleasing aspect is that it’s probably the most pressure I’ve ever 
been under as a player. When everyone is telling me to stop doing the 
job and it’s not working, to score runs is a nice place to be.

‘I
 would have loved those extra five, so that the 20-odd innings without a
 hundred that everyone keeps banging on about could have stopped.’

Few
 have suggested Cook be dropped from the side — only that England have 
won none of their last 10 Tests and that the captaincy may have affected
 his batting.

Fell: He eventually went just five short of his 100

But behind the choirboy’s smile last night lurked the grit that made him the third-highest run-scorer in England’s Test history.

‘It’s
 been a tough six months, and it’s still going to be tough,’ he said. 
‘But I feel as  if I’ve got a good attitude to the job and I can smile 
through tough times.’

Cook 
had a rare moment of good fortune when Jadeja dropped him at third slip 
off debutant seamer Pankaj Singh when he had only 15.

He
 said: ‘The attitude was to make sure at least I go down fighting, and 
sometimes you need a bit of luck. It was nice Jadeja dropped me, but he 
did have the last laugh.’

The
 overwhelming mood was one of relief. ‘It’s just a sense of contributing
 to the team,’ he said. ‘I can’t tell you how frustrating it is as a 
batter when you keep going out and not scoring runs and sit back there 
in the dressing-room. And everyone’s supporting you but it still feels 
as if you’re letting people down.

‘It
 was an amazing reception from the crowd, even when I was walking out to
 bat. I’ve never experienced anything like that. The noise would have 
been fantastic if I had got a hundred.’
