Footage has emerged which shows a toddler appearing to smoke a real cigarette.

The young girl, aged about two or three, puts the cigarette into her mouth and inhales several times before breathing out dark smoke. 

The clip, which has been uploaded to YouTube, is believed to have been taken in Finland and has caused public outrage.

One person wrote: 'Must originate from her sick parents or siblings. Persons under 18 are not allowed to either sell or purchase tobacco in Finland.

'The country has among the toughest smoking laws in the world.'

Some others have also suggested she could be smoking an e-cigarette. 

A two-year-old from Sumatra in Indonesia shocked the world after he was photographed chain-smoking cigarettes.

Ardi Rizal, who is now five, was photographed puffing on a cigarette while riding his tricycle.

The
 outcry led to the Indonesian government launching a campaign to tackle 
the problem of children smoking and organising special rehabilitation 
treatment to help Ardi quit.

Ardi
 was taken for play therapy sessions in the capital Jakarta for two 
weeks to take his mind off his 40-a-day habit and learn to be a normal 
toddler for the first time.

During
 his rehabilitation treatment, Ardi saw psychiatrists who encouraged his
 mother to keep him busy with playing and taught her about the dangers 
of smoking.

One of them - 
Dr Kak Seto - still sees Ardi and his family at regular intervals to 
ensure he is not falling back into old habits.

However,
 Mrs Rizal is now worried about her son's weight, as he developed food 
cravings while quitting smoking, and now has a big appetite.

Last
 week the Labour party proposed an amendment to the Children and 
Families Bill which would ban drivers in private vehicles from smoking 
when a child is present.

Health Minister Mark Drakeford also believes electronic cigarettes are 're-normalising' smoking.

He told BBC Wales' Sunday Politics: 'I am far more worried that the e-cigarette movement is re-normalising smoking that it's re-glamorising smoking. 

'It contains nicotine and nicotine is highly addictive. We don't want e-cigarettes to become a gateway to real cigarettes.'
