Most people dread the blustery rainy weather and dark mornings of autumn, but for one six-year-old girl the dull days are a blessed relief.

Every time the sun shines little Sarah Chapman is left in excruciating pain from an incurable skin complaint.

The little girl suffers from rare skin condition porphyria which means she has to be totally covered from harmful rays from the sun every time she leaves home.

Rare condition: Little Sarah, from Sunderland, must cover up when out in the sunshine. Her skin will itch and swell up if she is exposed to the sun's rays

Exposure to the sun for even a few seconds will see the youngster's skin swell and become unbearably painful and itchy.

Sarah, from West Bolton, Sunderland, is one of only handful of children in the UK who suffer from the rare genetic condition Erythropoietic Protoporphyria.

Her brother and sister are both clear of the condition.

The schoolgirl has even dubbed rainy and
overcast days 'Sarah's weather' as these are the only days she can 
venture outside without sunblock and a range of measures to keep her 
safe.

Still smiling: Sarah Chapman and parents Gillian and Bryan at home in Sunderland, the schoolgirl has a rare skin condition which means she must avoid the sun's rays

Every day Sarah is forced to wear sunscreen, hats and gloves to shield her skin from the sun and must use an umbrella when she leaves the house.

Her mother Gillian first realised something was wrong when Sarah was just three years old and her hands started to swell up.

EPP is an extremely painful condition which is caused by a deficiency in the enzyme ferrochelatase. High levels of thisÂ  in the skin results in the unbearable itching that sufferers must endure.

The condition usually presents when a child and mostly affects the upper surfaces of arms, legs and the feet.

If the EPP is serious a sufferer can loose skin in sheets after severe blistering due to sun exposure.

Normal anti-itch creams and treatments cannot soothe the unbearable itching and the main treatment is preventative by covering the skin.

Because the condition can cause nerve damage sufferers often present with symptoms of muscle weakness.

She said: 'Sarah's hands became swollen into the shape of a claw and we took her to South Tyneside District Hospital where she underwent tests.

'She was transferred to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary, where the doctors at first thought she had an allergy to something.'

The family kept a diary of Sarah's ailments as doctors battled to discover why the youngster's face and hands were swelling up and causing her pain.

Eventually medics diagnosed EPP and Sarah and her family have been able to safeguard her from the sun.

The family car has even had its windows darkened so that the little girl can travel safely.

Mrs Chapman added: 'It's really sad when the rest of the family is out sunbathing and enjoying the sun, and Sarah cannot join in.

'But she knows how she can suffer in sunlight and will say, 'I don't want that, mammy!

'So holidays in hot countries abroad are a no-no and apart from her hat, gloves, umbrella and sun block, we even have the windows of the car protected, in case the rays of the sun affect Sarah's skin.'

It is thought that EPP is a condition caused by a genetic disorder and that both Mrs Chapman and her husband Brian have the faulty gene and have passed it on to Sarah.

Mrs Chapman adding: 'It's thought that Bryan and I both have the faulty gene, which has caused Sarah's condition, which has not affected our other children, Matthew, four, and nine-year-old Rebecca.

'A lot of research is taking place in the US into porphyria and EPP and we would like to increase awareness of the condition in this country and help to raise money for research.'
