A man was caught at a Houston airport trying to transport tamales filled with cocaine.

The incident happened Wednesday at Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) said in a release.

The man was taken aside for 'additional screening' as it was revealed he was traveling with 200 tamales, the agency said.

They 'were not disclosed on the traveler's declaration,' the release said.

Almost seven ounces worth of cocaine were revealed to be inside bags tucked into the tamales, CBP said.

The 46-year-old that was apprehended is originally from El Salvador and was on his way to New York, the agency said.

CBP Service Port Director Beverly Good said in the release 'This type of seizure speaks to our level of commitment in disrupting criminal activity despite the concealment method.'

CBP said it handed the man to the Houston Police Department.
