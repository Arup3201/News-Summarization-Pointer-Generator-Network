A scale model of Noah’s Ark has been built based on a blueprint drawn up in ancient Babylon 4,000 years ago.

The expert behind the Biblical undertaking rocked the world last year with his controversial theory that the fabled ark was round and made of reeds.

Now such a coracle-like vessel has been constructed according to exact instructions marked on clay tablets from ancient Mesopotamia, now modern-day Iraq.

Dr Irving Finkel, assistant keeper of the Middle East department at the British Museum, said the scaled-down version of the ark is just large enough to accommodate a few pairs of ‘well behaved animals’.

He first discovered the description, written in cuneiform – the first script in human history - years ago when the tablet was found by a member of the public and worked for 20 years in deciphering it.

It says the ark is round and is the first record of the famous Babylonian flood story, which was later recorded in the book of Genesis.

Dr Irving Finkel, assistant keeper of the Middle East department at the British Museum said the scaled-down version of the ark is just large enough to accommodate a few pairs of ‘well behaved animals’. Its design was based on an ancient Babylonia tablet that he first deciphered five years ago

Dr Finkel explained the ark has two levels - a house on the upper deck - and space for animals below (pictured). He suggests that with careful organisation, it would have been theoretically possible to provide a home for lots of local species - even though he does not think the ark was built to its original huge design

What a revelation: According to the ancient Babylonian writing, Noah's Ark was a 220ft wide coracle - the equivalent of six London buses - with walls 20ft high. However, Dr Finkel does not think such a vast vessel would have been possible, having supervised the building of the smaller replica

The text describes god speaking to Atram-Hasis, a Sumerian king who is the Noah figure in earlier versions of the ark story.

He says: 'Wall, wall! Reed wall, reed wall! Atram-Hasis, pay heed to my advice, that you may live forever! Destroy your house, build a boat; despise possessions And save life! Draw out the boat that you will built with a circular design; Let its length and breadth be the same.'

The ancient Babylonian text describes the ark as a round 220-ft diameter coracle with walls 20-ft high.

According to the tablet, the ark had two levels and a roof on the top.

The craft was divided into sections to divide the various animals into their own sections.

The 60 lines of text, which Dr Finkel describes as a 'detailed construction manual for building an ark', claims the craft was built using ropes and reeds before being smeared with bitumen to make it waterproof.

The tablet specifies that the Ark’s floor was the area ‘of one field’ and its sides were constructed from 30 ribs and 3,600 stanchions, covered with ‘one finger of bitumen,’ The Times reported.

Experts say the ‘real’ Ark would have been half the size of a football pitch in area and built with enough rope to stretch from Edinburgh to London.

Dr Finkel concluded that the Ark could never have been built to that size, based on its structural integrity as well as the vast amount of materials needed.

Historians specialising in Middle Eastern boat design, used computer models to test whether a full-size vessel could theoretically have sailed.

Dr Finkel told MailOnline they found that ribs and planks large enough for the design couldn’t have been found anywhere in the natural world and concluded that the Babylonians didn’t have the technology to splice wood, making the full-size ark impossible to build. 

Despite this, a team  built a small replica in Kerala, south west India over four months.

Their efforts are the focus of a forthcoming television programme called The Real Noah’s Ark, which will be aired on Channel 4 at 8pm on Sunday.

Dr Finkel said that the team was able to stick to the ancient recipe in the way it was intended.

The ark they produced weighed around 35 tonnes and required the right kind of materials to be imported or sourced locally and transported by elephant.

The team didn’t cheat by using modern power tools, glue or nails, but instead used just wood, bamboo, palms and reed to secure the joints, as people may have done 4,000 years ago. 

Indian bitumen was used to waterproof the replica ark was was hard to work with (pictured). Dr Finkel said that if the waterproofing had gone better and superior quality Iraqi bitumen had been used, the ark could sail across the Atlantic and stay afloat because it was so stable

The tablet tells the familiar story of Noah's Ark, complete with detailed instructions for building a giant round vessel known as a coracle — as well as the key instruction that animals should enter 'two by two.'

The artefact was discovered in the Middle East by Leonard Simmons, who indulged his passion for history while serving in the RAF from 1945 to 1948.

The relic was passed to his son Douglas, who took it to Dr Finkel to translate. It is now on display at The British Museum.

It is light brown, about the size of a mobile phone and covered in the jagged cuneiform script of the ancient Mesopotamians.

Dr Finkel, said: 'It was really a heart-stopping moment [seeing the tablet for the first time] — the discovery that the boat was to be a round boat,' said Dr Finkel,

He believes a round boat makes sense.

Coracles were widely used as river taxis in ancient Iraq and are perfectly designed to bob along on raging floodwaters.

'It's a perfect thing,' Finkel said. 'It never sinks, it's light to carry.'

The team said the hardest part of the reconstruction was coating the outside and inside of the vessel with sticky bitumen, which was used to keep it watertight.

‘In ancient Mesopotamia this was the easy bit, for the best quality bitumen bubbled out of the ground like healing springs elsewhere,’ Dr Finkel explained.

Instead the team had to make do with Indian bitumen which dries very fast and re-melts in the heat, making it incredibly difficult to work with. 

He arrived in Kerala to inspect the finished handiwork, remarking that it looks like it had ‘floated right out of the Bronze Age’.

Sadly, however, the Ark was not as perfect as it seemed and when launched, water began leaking into the hull. A pump was used to keep it afloat.

Despite this, Dr Finkel said that the inferior bitumen was to blame, but the Babylonian design was watertight and produced a stable vessel.

‘There would have been room for lots of well-behaved animals on the lower floor and with the right bitumen, we could have floated to New York,’ he said.

Dr Finkel hailed the Babylonian design ‘extremely effective’ and said that it was extremely stable to be aboard.

‘If we could use Iraqi bitumen and plastered it on carefully, we could drift towards New York without trouble,’ he said.

The expert compared watching the launch of the scale-size ark to watching the birth of a child.

He told MailOnline: ‘I couldn’t do anything to help and was pacing but it was beautiful when it went in with a splash and floated. Really marvellous.

‘What was amazing was that we had a 4,000-year recipe and with some head scratching, we found we could do what it said.’

Dr Finkel said that the story of Noah’s Ark was an oral narrative for a long time, based on a destructive flood in around 1750BC.

The poet who wrote on the tablet recounted the tale and possibly took his inspiration for the shape of the ark from what was outside his window floating along the Euphrates or the Tigris – coracles.

‘Coracles were frequently seen and were efficient craft made from bamboo, wood and bitumen, holding two to three people,’ he said.

‘They were a daily type of water transport and that when waterproofed won’t sink, so they keep their content – people and maybe goats – safe.

He explains that when enlarged, the coracle turns into Noah’s Ark as a life-reserving raft with a roof.

The measurements describes on the tablet are gigantic, but in proportion to those used to make the small coracles.

Dr Finkel said that the poet was satisfying locals by recounting familiar details of the tale, while also pleasing fishermen and helping people to imagine the ark more accurately by providing measurements.

‘Someone added real data. He must have got information from local coracle makers and scaled it up. The numbers are accurate and sensible and that’s fascinating from a scientific point of view.’

‘It’s a mythological story with a high adventure element, with the poet stopping to give you dimensions so you could build one,’ he said. 

He doesn't think the tablet provides evidence the ark described in the Bible existed. He said it's more likely that a devastating real flood made its way into folk memory, and has remained there ever since.
