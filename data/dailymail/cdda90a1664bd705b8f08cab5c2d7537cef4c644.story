Wayne Rooney and Joe Hart should be omitted from Roy Hodgson's England XI to face Slovenia   - according to the Premier League's official player ranking index provided by EA Sports.

Taking into account every second of every English player's performances in the Premier League this season, EA have provided a balanced squad of the 23 most in-form players, and from that a best XI.

Rooney and Hart - the only representatives from the Manchester clubs - make the squad but do not make the XI.

England's best XI based on EA Sports Data

The index has instead Southampton's Fraser Forster starting ahead of Manchester City's Hart, while QPR's Charlie Austin and West Brom's Saido Berahino are preferred to Manchester United's Rooney up front.

Berahino - the highest-rated player in the squad - is one of three West Brom players picked, making them the joint-most represented club along with Southampton and West Ham.

City and United, meanwhile, have the same number of representatives in the squad (1) as Crystal Palace, Hull, QPR and Stoke.

Just nine of England's World Cup squad make the 23, but the centre back pairing from Brazil of Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka are retained in the XI.

Of Hodgson's last starting XI, who played Estonia last month, only four make the EA XI.

Raheem Sterling, who came off the bench in that match, is one star name who does make the cut, as does his Liverpool team-mate Jordan Henderson.

There is no place in the squad for Jack Wilshere, with West Ham's Mark Noble starting in midfield alongside Henderson.

This squad  will surely be widely different from Hodgson's - named on Thursday for the qualifier on Novermber 15 - but it certainly raises some interesting questions regarding selection.
