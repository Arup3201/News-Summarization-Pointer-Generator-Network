Former Liverpool manager Kenny Dalglish has branded Luis Suarez a 'fantastic person', and said that losing him at Liverpool is comparable to if Barcelona were to lose Lionel Messi.

After presenting Suarez with the Golden Shoe award, Dalglish hailed his former striker, and said he hoped he would return to Anfield one day.

Dalglish told BarcaTV that his old club would miss his goals, and explained that Suarez's all-round game was vital to Liverpool, but insisted that the club had no hard feelings about his departure.

Kenny Dalglish shares a joke with Luis Suarez after presenting him with the Golden Shoe award 

Luis Suarez scored 31 goals for Liverpool last season despite missing six games through suspension

'How would Barcelona fans feel if Lionel Messi left, for example?' Dalglish asked BarcaTV. 

'It was a huge disappointment for Liverpool fans, but obviously life must go on. I believe every fan would love to see him return to Liverpool one day.'

'He scored 31 goals and missed six games, but he also had an awful lot of assists. More than 50 per cent of Liverpool's goals, you'll love it when you see him. 

'They were a little bit disappointed but he left with the best wishes of everyone.'

Dalglish particularly praised the Uruguayan striker's team ethic, and said his combination with Messi and Brazil captain Neymar would terrify defenders.

Suarez move to Barcelona in the summer but has yet to make his first team debut due to supsension

'He loves playing football, he loves to win,' Dalglish added. 'The most important thing to Luis is the team is successful. He'd rather score none and win 1-0 than score three and lose 4-3.

'He is a fantastic person, a true family man. When are you most happy is when he's playing football, or training, or when sitting at home with the family.' 

'I can not imagine how a defender who had to face Neymar, Messi and Suarez would feel. I don't think he would be able to sleep much the night before.'
