With seats that convert into a sofa, a tea-tasting area, a coffee saloon and a cocktail bar, Taiwan's China Airlines' newest aircraft, the Boeing 777-300ER, looks more like a lounge in the sky than it does an aeroplane.

The swanky new 358-seater aircraft has 40 seats in Premium Business Class, 62 seats in Premium Economy Class and 256 seats in economy.

The interior of the plane - decked out in wood grain - is styled like a trendy bar and incorporates the industry's first high-ceiling Sky Lounge in Premium Class, complete with bookshelves filled with a selection of Chinese and English books.
