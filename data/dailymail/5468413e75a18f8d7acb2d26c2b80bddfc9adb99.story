Casey Kasem, the legendary radio host, has been found in Washington, just hours after his daughter filed a missing person's report with Santa Monica Police.

Kerri Kasem alleged that her 82-year-old father's wife, Jean, moved the former Top 40 host to a Native American reservation in Washington from his California care home earlier this month.

On Wednesday night however, police said he has already been located 'somewhere in the Pacific Northwest'.

Worried: Kerri Kasem has been made a temporary caretaker for her father and a judge demanded an investigation into his disappearance

'If they found him, I want to know if 
he's alright,' Miss Kasem told the Daily News. 'We haven't heard anything. We
 just want to know he's ok.'

A spokesman for the family later told Fox News: 'The family has grave concerns about his medical care.

'The Kasem family will do everything in their power to bring their father home.'

A judge had made Miss Kasem a temporary caretaker for her father, and the courts ordered an investigation into his whereabouts as his adult children say they fear for his well being.

The radio show host's middle daughter said that she and her sister Julie had visited their father last week, just days before he was secretly moved from his Santa Monica nursing home.

Miss Kasem claims that her estranged stepmom, Jean Kasem is 
responsible for the disappearance, and that the woman moved him in the 
middle of the night without a court order or doctor's discharge.

On Tuesday, a court granted Miss Kasem conservatorship of her father's health.

'I will do whatever I need to do to get my dad back!' Kerri, 35, told Closer.
 'I'm praying that he is somewhere safe. I'm praying to God that heâ€™s 
being cared for and that he's not getting sicker and sicker by the day.'

When
 she visited her dad on May 6 it was the first time she had been able to
 see him in five months. An attorney had to help her and her sister gain
 access to his room.

'They let me and my sister in to see him and it was a wonderful visit,' Miss Kasem said. 'My dad said, "I love you".

'Dad was animated. He was smiling. He moved his arms a little bit. He knew we were there,' she added to Closer.

'When
 we went to leave, we said, "Dad, we'll be back soon. We'll be back 
soon." That's when he looked up at us and was able to say the word, 
"When?" We said, "Dad, as soon as we can,"' she said.

Attorney Martha Patterson, an attorney for Ms Kasem, has claimed that Jean Kasem has no authority to act as a healthcare agent or to move her husband without permission from a doctor.

'I cannot imagine someone in his condition being carried out without proper medical equipment,' she said.

Miss Kasem added that she was 'filled with an extreme amount of worry' about her father.

The daughter's words come after a 
judge ordered an investigation into the whereabouts of the comedian 
after an attorney for the ailing man's wife said he had been removed 
from the country.

Los 
Angeles Superior Court Judge Daniel Murphy ordered a court investigator 
and adult protective services to find out where Mr Kasem is being 
treated and report back to the court.

The elderly radio personality has been in various medical facilities chosen by his wife.

His
 children had earlier complained they had been unable to see their 
father in accordance with an agreement with their stepmother.

Miss Kasem's attorney, Troy Martin, said the family believes the entertainer has been taken to a Native American reservation in Washington state.

Judge Murphy's order came after Craig Marcus, an attorney who appeared on Jean Kasem's behalf at Monday's hearing, said he did not know where the radio personality was but knew that he had been removed from the country.

'I have no idea where he is,'Mr Marcus said.

The
 revelation brought stunned protests from Judge Murphy and two of Mr Kasem's daughters from a 
previous marriage.

'Your statements concern me even more,' the judge told Mr Marcus, who declined to comment after the hearing.

Mr Marcus said in court that Jean Kasem had every right to move her husband as she saw fit.

Judge
 Murphy appointed a doctor to look into Mr Kasem's care and ordered a 
court-appointed attorney to find out his whereabouts as soon as 
possible.

Mr Kasem 
gained fame with his radio music countdown shows, American Top 40 and 
Casey's Top 40, and was the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon Scooby Doo.

As
 temporary conservator, Miss Kasem will have access to her father's 
medical records and other reports that have previously been sealed by 
court order.
