England will be the only part of the UK where free plastic bags are not outlawed after the Treasury blocked calls for a levy.

George Osborne is understood to be nervous about imposing extra costs on shoppers at a time of austerity.

The Chancellor rejected calls from Liberal Democrats who were pushing for a levy of between 5p and 10p per bag

The Liberal Democrats claim the Treasury has been the last stumbling block to securing a levy on plastic bags to rubbish, seen here in Hyde Park

The refusal to take action has dismayed some MPs.

Tory
Zac Goldsmith said: 'I understand the Treasury’s concern about adding 
expense for shoppers, but a levy of this sort would be voluntary, and 
therefore absolutely avoidable.

'Nor
would it be a stealth tax, because all the proceeds from people who 
choose to continue buying throw-away bags would be recycled back to 
community charities.

'I
can see no good reason at all why England should be the only part of 
the UK without this popular and easy conservation measure.'

It is understood the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs appealed to the Treasury in to include the measure in the Autumn Statement.

Lib Dem farming minister David Heath raised hopes in October, telling MPs a decision would be made 'sooner rather than later' to limit the environmental impact of throw-away bags.

But Mr Osborne did not include it when he delivered his statement in the Commons earlier this month. Treasury ministers have been publicly cool on the idea.

Sajid Javid said in a parliamentary answer recently: 'The Government keeps all options for tackling waste under review with any announcements on tax made at Budget.

'The Government continues to discuss with the retail sector the scale of carrier bag distribution and actions under way to reduce usage.

'Arrangements for compulsory charges on carrier bags in Scotland and Northern-Ireland, like in Wales, are a matter for the devolved administrations.'

Junior environment minister Richard Benyon also suggested responsibility for reducing bag use lay with shoppers not minsters.

'The ability to take action also lies with consumers who can decline to accept them, in favour of reusable alternatives,' he said.

Environment minister Richard Benyon said it was up to shoppers to use fewer bags

Official figures show around 350million more bags were given out by retailers over last year, despite David Cameron demanding ‘a drop.

The PM warned in September 2011 that unless stores delivered ‘significant falls’ over the next 12 months, they could either be banned outright from giving out single-use bags or be legally required to charge customers for them.

Instead the number rose by around five per cent to 6.75billion for 2011-12, but so far the government has refused to act.

A Defra spokesman said: 'We want to work with retailers to help them lift their game to cut the number of bags they hand out.  We are monitoring the results of the charging scheme in Wales and the outcome of the Scottish consultation on a charge so that we can make a fully informed decision.'

The Daily Mail’s Banish The Bags campaign has called upon companies and politicians to help reduce the number of single-use plastic bags.

It has won the wide support of readers and charities, including the Marine Conservation Society, National Trust and Campaign to Protect Rural England.

In October the Lib Dems rewrote party policy to demand a levy on plastic bags.

Justine McGuinness, a former election candidate who also acted as a spokesman for or Kate and Gerry McCann's Find Madeleine Fund, said she used to be against the party’s policy on plastic bags but had changed her mind after visiting Ireland.

‘You don’t see plastic bags floating around in hedgerows because of course there is a plastic bag tax.

'It has changed people’s behaviour and that to me is a sign of a very good policy. It is a policy which will effect change.’
