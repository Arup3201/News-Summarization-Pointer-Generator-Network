The mother of two boys aged four and two who died within months of each other had asked social services to take her children away, an inquest heard today.

Shelley Adams of Southampton, Hampshire, called the local authority to plead for help four weeks before the death of her youngest child, Jayden.

She told social workers that she couldn’t cope and wanted he and his brother to be taken away.

Southampton General Hospital, where Shelley Adams's two sons, Jayden, two, and Bradley, four, were pronounced dead within two months of each other after she had begged social services to take them away

The boy had been on the 'at risk' register since the age of one over fears of neglect. But no decision was made to take him into care, the inquest in Southampton heard.

In January 2011, two-year-old Jayden was pronounced dead at hospital having been admitted limp and unconscious.

Just two months later, in April that year, his brother Bradley, four, was admitted to Southampton General Hospital suffering cardiac arrest, the inquest heard.

He died three days later.

Only hours earlier he had been deemed fit and healthy by staff at his nursery, while he was also seen less than an hour before being taken to hospital and appeared well.

That incident involved a group of youths who saw Ms Adams putting the child outside on a step, where he was crying and upset.

After Bradley's death Ms Adams was arrested on suspicion of murder. Detectives from Hampshire’s major crime department said they had had 'strong suspicions' of foul play.

Detective inspector Dave Dilly, who led the investigation, told the inquest Ms Adams, who has learning difficulties, led a chaotic lifestyle and was heavily involved with social services throughout her life.

But despite extensive enquiries the Crown Prosecution Service took the decision not to bring criminal proceedings against her.

The matter was also thrashed out in the High Court over a considerable period of time, the inquest heard, because of ongoing care proceedings involving a surviving child.

As part of that the judge, Mr Justice Baker, had to decided on the 'balance of probability' whether Ms Adams was responsible for the children’s deaths.

He found that she was 'neglectful', she struggled as a parent, she dished out corporal punishment to the boys, put her own needs before those of Bradley and Jayden and struggled to provide appropriate food for them.

He went on to say she was responsible for 'chronic neglect' despite receiving considerable support from social services and she was unable to cope with the demands of being a parent.

He acknowledged there was ‘a significant possibility that the mother was responsible for the death of the boys’ but ruled that ultimately the local authority had not been able to prove on the balance of probability that she smothered either child.

Southampton coroner Keith Wiseman recorded open verdicts on both deaths.

He said there were ‘controversial circumstances’ surrounding the deaths of both boys that would have long lasting repercussions for those involved.
