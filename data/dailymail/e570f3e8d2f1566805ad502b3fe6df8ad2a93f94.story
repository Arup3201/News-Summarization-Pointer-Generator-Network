Florida and Nevada women wear higher heels than their New York counterparts, according to new research by Gilt.

In fact, Puerto Rico had the most vertiginous footwear, with an average height of 2.87 inches, as seen in a map created by the shopping site to illustrate average heel heights throughout the country.

Despite New York's fashion-forward reputation, its shoe purchases on Gilt featured heels that were merely 2.09 inches on average - while Florida's footwear was 2.46 inches.

And while celebrities are regularly seen teetering around Hollywood in towering shoes, California's average heel was only 2.25 inches, far from the nation's highest. 

Nevada was second only to Puerto Rico - an evening out in Las Vegas requires a dazzling pair of pumps, after all - and Arkansas fell into the top range too.

While those were the only states in the 2.36 - 2.9-inch range, Texas was close behind at 2.35 inches.

Surprising: Despite New Yorkers' reputation for wearing stilettos - perpetuated by Sarah Jessica Parker's shoe-obsessed character Carrie Bradshaw on Sex and the City - Gilt found that the state's average heel height was in one of the lower ranges

The states with the most conservative shoes were in the Midwest and New England: Nebraska, Kansas, Maine and Vermont all fell into the sensibly low range of 1.80-1.97 inches.

The research was conducted by Gilt's Principal Data Scientist Igor Elbert, who 'got a bit curious about whether certain fashion preferences might be regional or universal,' according to the Gilt Tech Blog.

He and Gilt Data Analyst Debbie Chung began looking at regional style trends, also discovering that 'black is, um, still the “new black” in every corner of the country,' before commissioning the infograph from Gilt designer Rhianon Cha-os.

According to the numbers on the map, most American women are standing closer to the ground than their European counterparts.

In 2012, a study by the foot care brand Compeed found that the average heel height in the U.K. was 3.3 inches, while it was 3.2 inches in Spain, 3 inches in Denmark, 2.7 inches in Germany and 2.4 inches in France.
