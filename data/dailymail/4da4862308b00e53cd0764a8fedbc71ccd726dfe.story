Channel 4's Benefits Street has now received more than 1,700 complaints as one of its stars, 'Black Dee' was charged with drug and firearms offences

Channel 4’s controversial Benefits Street documentary has now received more than 1,700 complaints as one of its stars was charged with drug and firearms offences.

The broadcaster and TV watchdog Ofcom have been deluged with calls, letters and emails from viewers who accused the five-part documentary of glamourising crime, promoting drug use and celebrating welfare dependency.

Yesterday it emerged one of the core participants - Samora Roberts, known in the show as ‘Black Dee’ - will face prosecution for a string of charges alongside five of her neighbours.

The 32-year-old - who was also arrested last week for allegedly stealing a packet of condoms from a branch of Boots - has been charged with conspiracy to supply class A and class B drugs including crack cocaine, possession of class A drug diamorphine and possession of firearm ammunition without a certificate.

West Midlands Police raided her house on the now infamous James Turner Street in Birmingham last June.

She will appear at Birmingham Magistrates Court on February 6 alongside other residents, including Benefits Street co-star Charlene Wilson, 29.

Channel 4 have said it has no plans to change the programme despite the potential risk it could prejudice any future trial.

But the number of viewer complaints has continued to soar.

Last night, Ofcom said it had received a total of 945 complaints, while 820 contacted Channel 4 directly.

A
 Channel 4 spokesman said some viewers will have contacted both Ofcom 
and Channel 4 meaning not all should be counted as separate complaints.

Benefits Street is the channel’s biggest ratings hit since its coverage of the Paralympics in 2012.

But some critics labelled it ‘poverty porn’ and said it is paints a false picture of life in modern Britain.

Others praised it for exposing the truth of benefits fraud but said it failed to condemn crime and also exploits children, exposing them to bullying and victimisations.

Some residents said the show - which shows children swearing and misbehaving - has left youngsters to ashamed and embarrassed to go to school.

Last week, another participant Deidre Kelly - known as White Dee - revealed she is a former Liberal Democrat who now supports the Labour party in protest at Nick Clegg’s support for the Coalition.
