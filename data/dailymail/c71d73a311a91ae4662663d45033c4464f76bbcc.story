Bob Kraft, the billionaire owner of the New England Patriots, has been going steady with his blonde girlfriend for nearly three years now - but who is this elusive bombshell?

Ricki Noel Lander, a 34-year-old actress raised in Salt Lake City, Utah, started dating Massachusetts-based Mr Kraft - worth an estimated $4 billion - in the summer of 2012, almost exactly a year after the mogul lost his beloved wife of 48 years, Myra Kraft, to cancer at the age of 68.

Miss Lander - who is 39 years younger than Mr Kraft, and 16 years younger than his eldest son - was seemingly pivotal in lifting Mr Kraft from his period of profound mourning and has remained close by his side ever since, accompanying him to official engagements, football games and family events.

Match made in heaven? Ricki Lander, a 34-year-old actress, started dating 73-year-old Patriots owner Bob Kraft - worth an estimated $4 billion - in the summer of 2012. Pictured, the couple in October 2014

Ricki Lander is a lady in red

Stopping traffic in red satin!

A red satin dress will always make a statement, but with the plunging neckline and high slit, Ricki Lander was turning heads on the red carpet that evening.  She finished off her look perfectly with soft waves, nude heels and sparkling clutch.  The long sleeves and loose fit balance the plunging neckline.

While some may shy away at such a bold color, red gowns are really quite versatile.  They can be worn throughout the year for Valentine's Day, the holiday season or any gala involving Red Cross, AIDs or AMA.  Since it's such a striking color, accessorizing would not be necessary.

We love the selections below and with one very similar dress starting at only $72, it's a good risk to take to be the belle of the ball or the lady in red.

But in addition to her role as Mr Kraft’s significant other, Miss Lander boasts an impressive career history.

The pretty blonde – who is a former model, trained dancer, fashion designer, sometime-actress and TV reporter – is currently a correspondent for PBS' exploration series 'The Travel Detective'.

She also recently designed a collection of casual womenswear called Let Loose By RNL for Fanatics, a sports merchandise retailer which sells NFL-branded clothing.

The website states: 'Recently, after attending several sporting events, [Miss Lander] noticed a gap in team gear for young, style conscious women and was inspired to design lifestyle apparel for the college teams you love.'

Although Miss Lander's 'first love' has always been fashion, she claims, she started her career off as a dancer.

At the age of only 15, she trained with the Los Angeles Classical Ballet, before touring Japan and later graduating from Miami's Florida International University with a Bachelors of the Arts in Dance.

Miss Lander also spent seven years as a Ford model, appearing in campaigns for Levi's, Macy's, Target, and Benefit, among others.

Her acting credits, which begin in 2006, include small, often unaccredited and typecast roles on shows like The Class and Ugly Betty, where she played ‘Stunning Woman’ and ‘Model,’ respectively.

In 2008’s Iron Man, she played a sassy flight attendant who offers Robert Downey Jr's character a drink of hot sake; and in 2011, she was seen as a Servant Faerie on the HBO series True Blood.

In 2012, shortly after meeting, the new couple appeared in a bizarre audition tape together which promptly went viral.

Mr Kraft, who has four sons, was helping his bikini-clad girlfriend with an audition for the role of a pole dancer called ‘Mary Elena’.

The embarrassing video sees Mr Kraft read lines, pretend to punch a male character and yell: 'F*** you, p****!’

At the time, Mr Kraft referred to Miss Lander as merely 'a pal' and issued a public apology in which he expressed his regret that the video had been released, saying: '[I'm] going to stick to my day job.'

Mr Kraft reportedly fell into a deep depression after his wife Myra, a well-known philanthropist, died of cancer at the age of 68.

Speaking to the The Boston Globe in January 2013, Mr Kraft said he felt 'robbed', and his close friend Donald Trump commented: 'They had an amazing marriage, and Bob was devastated when she died.'

During the football season following Myra's 2011 death, all Mr Kraft's Patriots players wore a patch on their uniforms bearing her initials, 'MHK'.

Playing the part: Miss Lander's acting credits begin in 2006, and include small, often unaccredited and typecast roles in movies such as Movie 43, in which she plays 'Nurse Elizabeth' (pictured)

'I try to stay very busy, I basically work seven days a week,' Mr Kraft said of his coping strategies following Myra's death. 'I try to do new things, to meet new people.'

Indeed, his eldest son and president of The Kraft Group Jonathan Kraft, 50, remarked that his father was 'someone who needs companionship'.

That companionship came in the form of Miss Lander, who he was first photographed with in June 2012 courtside at a Celtics game.

Mr Kraft has declined to talk about their relationship to this day, but often attends public events with the statuesque actress on his arm.

Miss Lander will no doubt be playing the supportive girlfriend during what has been a contentious time for Mr Kraft.

On Tuesday, he was forced to deny accusations that the Patriots deliberately under-inflated footballs used in the team's AFC Championship Game against the Indianapolis Colts on January 18.

Speaking in Arizona, where the Patriots are preparing to face the Seattle Seahawks at Sunday's Super Bowl, he insisted his team is innocent over 'Deflate-gate'.

He also welcomed the resulting investigation into these accusations and called on the NFL to apologize if its probe clears them.
