Passionate: Jackie Kennedy, painted in 1960, enjoyed a number of liaisons in the years that followed Jack's death

Jackie Kennedy had secret romances with both of JFK’s married brothers after his 1963 assassination, according to an explosive new book.

While it has been widely reported that Jackie had a passionate fling with Bobby Kennedy, the book alleges for the first time that she also had trysts with his younger brother Teddy.

In Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis: A Life Beyond Her Wildest Dreams, published to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the former first lady’s death, the authors also claim Hollywood stars Gregory Peck and Paul Newman were among her lovers.

Other leading men who reportedly shared her bed include Marlon Brando, Warren Beatty, William Holden and Frank Sinatra.

But it is the claim of an affair with Teddy – thought previously to be simply a trusted confidante – that will be most shocking to followers of America’s most famous political dynasty.

Both brothers were married – Bobby to Ethel in 1950 and Teddy to Joan in 1958 – but were drawn closer to heartbroken Jackie in the wake of her husband’s shooting in Dallas.

Then after Bobby’s assassination in Los Angeles in June 1968, Jackie’s reliance on Teddy turned to romance, authors Darwin Porter and Danforth Prince claim.

‘Teddy stood by Jackie through one crisis after another, becoming the one man in her life she could depend on,’ they write.

‘I’ve always been in love with Jackie, right from the beginning,’ Teddy was quoted as telling David Powers, special assistant to JFK.

‘When Jack died, I knew she was seeing Bobby too but that didn’t stop me. Bobby couldn’t always be with her.’ 

He even told Powers that he married wife Joan ‘because she had some of Jackie’s qualities’.

Jackie wed John F Kennedy in 1953, with Bobby and Teddy in the front row. ‘Call it Brotherly Love. Three handsome Irish-American brothers were destined to fall in love with Jackie. In very different ways, she would love all three of them,’ Porter and Prince write.

Steamy: Jackie's affair with brother-in-law Ted Kennedy began while she was still seeing Bobby, say the authors. They shared many intimate moments together in the 1960s and 1970s from Washington to New York

One night stand: Jackie asked Paul Newman to meet at the Hotel Carlyle to persuade him to support Bobby's run for the Democrat presidential nomination. He was convinced of her sexual charms but not her politics

It was reportedly well-known in society circles that the Kennedy brothers passed women on to each other. ‘Bobby had taken over the affair with Marilyn Monroe after Jack broke it off. Even their father Joseph Kennedy passed women on to his sons,’ a source added.

After Bobby announced his candidacy for president in 1968, Jackie reportedly told writer Truman Capote: ‘I’m in love with two men at the same time, both Bobby and Teddy.’

Jackie and Teddy were said to have shared many intimate moments in the 1960s and 1970s.

But Jackie realised that Teddy – dubbed the ‘Lion’ of the US Senate who died in 2009 aged 77 – was also a womaniser and she began dating Aristotle Onassis in secret while still seeing Teddy. She married the Greek shipping magnate in October 1968. 

According to the book, the Kennedy brothers were by no means Jackie’s only high-profile conquests. Jackie, who died at the age of 64 in May 1994 after battling cancer, allegedly had a one-night stand with actor Paul Newman at New York’s Carlyle Hotel.

Bobby and me: After her husband Jack was assassinated in 1963, Jackie fell into Bobby's consoling arms

Quickies: Jackie confided to a friend that Jack wasn't a great lover. 'He wanted a quickie and then he was back on the phone talking with some silly politician. When we did have sex, he would turn over and go to sleep'

The actor reputedly had one of the strongest marriages in Hollywood, staying with actress Joanne Woodward for 50 years.

But the authors claim he was seduced 
after Jackie set up a meeting in 1968 to urge him to shift his political
 allegiance to Bobby in his doomed race for the White House.

Newman gave Jackie a porcelain rose 
and she reportedly told him that she had never been  able to satisfy her
 husband sexually. The couple are said to have parted the following 
morning with Newman’s allegiances unchanged.

Sparks also flew with William Holden, 
who was also married.  He reportedly invited Jackie to go horse riding 
after they met at a dinner party, and the couple embarked on a week-long
 affair.

According to Jackie’s close friend, 
artist Bill Walton, the fling was ‘primarily driven by Jackie’s desire 
to seek revenge on Jack’ for his cheating. JFK allegedly had affairs 
with actresses including Sophia Loren and Jean Simmons, as well as 
Marilyn Monroe. The book also suggests that Jackie was remarkably 
forward in her seductions.

Strangers in the night: Frank Sinatra long had a thing for Jackie but they didn't get together until 1975 when they went to his suite at the Waldorf Asotia Hotel. 'I can't believe this thing between me and Jackie,' Frank said

‘She kept waiting for me to try to get her into bed,’ Brando once said of their affair.

‘When I failed to make a move, she took matters into her own hands and popped the magic question, “Would you like to spend the night?” I said, “I thought you’d never ask.” ’

Earlier this year another book penned by Darwin Porter claimed Jackie Kennedy had an affair with ballet dancer Rudolf Nureyev while she was still in the White House.

And to add to the intrigue, it said Nureyev, who was nine years younger than the first lady, was also once spotted with Bobby ‘kissing each other passionately in a phone box’.

In The Pink Triangle, Porter describes how Jackie flew Nureyev to Washington in 1963 and they ‘plunged into a secret love affair that lasted years’.

He wrote: ‘Jackie first fell for Rudi the day she invited him and his legendary dance partner Margot Fonteyn to perform at the White House.’
