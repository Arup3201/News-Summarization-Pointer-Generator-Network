Labour has promised not to use any pictures of the Prime Minister in election posters– in a bid to stop the campaign turning into a presidential-style run off between David Cameron and Ed Miliband.

The party said it would not use negative personal attacks on Mr Cameron – and would focus on policies instead of personalities.

It comes as the Tories attempt to use the 'nightmare' scenario of Mr Miliband becoming Prime Minister to scare voters off electing Labour.

The Tories released an election poster last week suggesting Ed Miliband was preparing to make a deal with the SNP and Sinn Fein

In a poster released last week, Mr Miliband is pictured outside Number 10 with the SNP' Alex Salmond and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, under the slogan: 'Your worst nightmare just got even worse.'

Labour's election strategist Douglas Alexander said the Conservatives were preparing to spread 'fear and smear'.

The image was later rebranded by the Conservatives with the slogan: 'Fire up the Quattro, it's time for change.'

But, in a message to party members, the shadow foreign secretary said Labour would not try to match the Tory attack posters.

He wrote: 'The Tories have now bought up hundreds of billboard poster sites on high streets across the country for the months of March and April to run their negative personalised adverts.

'It already seems clear that in their campaign the Tories intend to spread falsehood, fear and smear.

'They will seek to avoid open debate and scrutiny. The Tories will dig deep into their donors' pockets - and plumb new depths - in their desperation to cling on in government.'

A Labour attack poster  during the 2010 election campaign accused David Cameron of wanting to take Britain back to the 1980s, using an image from the TV show Life on Mars

The Labour election poster backfired when the Tories released their own mocked-up version, with the slogan: 'Fire up the Quattro. It's time for change'

A spokesman told the BBC that focusing on 'issues, not personalities'.

Labour's pledge on posters follows the 2010 election campaign, in which it used Mr Cameron's face on a number of billboards and also online.

In one, he was shown as TV detective Gene Hunt alongside the message: 'Don't let him take Britain back to the 1980s.'
