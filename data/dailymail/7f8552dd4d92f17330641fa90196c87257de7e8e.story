Britney Spears split from her fiance Jason Trawick was confirmed to Mail Online yesterday, and now it's been revealed that she's already returned her $90,000 engagement ring.

It's over: Britney Spears has split from fiance Jason Trawick after a year-long engagement

Under California law, the ring must 
be returned unless the man called the engagement off... as Britney and 
Jason mutually agreed to part, the singer is doing the right thing.

The couple announced their engagement in December 2011, after confirming they were dating in May 2010.

A
source told Mail Online that the pair had been sleeping in separate 
bedrooms and their once strong relationship had fizzled into more of a 
friendship.

Britney said in a statement: 'Jason and I have decided to call off our engagement. I'll always adore him and we will remain great friends.'

Jason added: 'As this chapter ends for us a new one begins. I love and cherish her and her boys and we will be close forever.'

Britney's representative Jeff Raymond told Mail Online: 'Britney Spears and Jason Trawick have mutually agreed to end their one-year engagement.

'As two mature adults, they came to the difficult decision to go their separate ways while continuing to remain friends.'

Jason
also acted as Britney's manager, and the pop star has now changed 
management, indicating the pair are also severing ties in their business
relationship. Jason has reportedly resigned as Britney's co-conservator, but her father Jamie Spears will remain as conservator.

Further reports claim Jason has already moved out of the home the couple shared together, according to Radar Online.

While other sources claim the pair split over their differing opinions about wanting more children.

TMZ.com claim Britney was keen to increase her brood and have children with Trawick, but he wasn't keen to do so.

The website states that Jason is 'in another place' and doesn't want to start a family - although 'loves' her boys Sean Preston and Jayden James, her sons with ex Kevin Federline.

TMZ also claims the pair argued as Trawick felt being with Spears 'took away his individuality', while he wanted to expand his business and take on more clients - something Spears allegedly wasn't happy with.

The split announcement comes the same day as Britney confirmed she had quit her role as a judge on the X Factor.

According to the official statement released today, the 31-year-old pop star put in her resignation for the talent competition series on Friday.

'I had an incredible time doing the show and I love the other judges and I am so proud of my teens but it's time for me to get back in the studio,' Britney said, referring to her eighth album.

'Watching them all do their thing up 
on that stage every week made me miss performing so much! I can't wait 
to get back out there and do what I love most.'

However, the Grammy winner's team has reportedly already begun 'serious talks' for lucrative sitcom and Las Vegas concert deals.

According to TMZ, Spears and her 
people have been in serious negotiations with one of the Caesars group 
properties for 'a while.'

The former Mouseketeer is likely 
being wooed to star in her own long-running show at the Colloseum at 
Caesar's Palace since that is where Cher and Celine Dion also held 
residencies.

Dion scored $100 million a year to 
headline her show and her previous A New Day show grossed more than $400
million over five years.

Cher also struck a lucrative deal with the casino where she performed for three years at $60 million a year.

An insider noted that Britney could probably rake even more than either of the other pop legends in her deal.

Spears' team is also reportedly looking into possible sitcom appearances.

A Radar Online source said: 'Britney's manager, Larry Rudolph, is reading television scripts that the singer could accept. Britney's dad, Jamie feels that having his daughter on a sitcom would be a good fit for her.

'Britney needs to be kept busy, and a structured environment such as a television sitcom would be a natural fit for her. She actually has very natural comedic talents and is very funny, in an airhead sort of way.'

Simon Cowell, 53, was reportedly disappointed with his $15 million contracted employee on the talent competition since he wanted 'crazy Britney, but he got boring Britney.'

According toÂ Us Weekly, the network 'paid all that for her to say "amazing" and offer half-claps' for her four protegees.

The December 20 second season finale was watched by only 9.6 million viewers, down 18 percent from the first season finale.
