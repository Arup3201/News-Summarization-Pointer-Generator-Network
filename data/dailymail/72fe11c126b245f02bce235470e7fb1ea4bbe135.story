These days the perfect pint comes in many forms - beers are flavoured with citrus fruits, jalapeno and even bacon.

But now there is a brew made from fossils and it is said to taste 'sweet and untamed'.

The founder of a palaeontology and geology organisation set out to find an untapped strain of yeast to make his strange brew in a bid to sneak science into drinks.

An ancient brew: Bone Dusters Paleo Ale is made from bacteria discovered on a whale fossil (pictured). Two scientists looking for an ancient yeast sample from which to make their brew, discovered a new subspecies and plan on using different fossils to make more palaeontology-themed beers

The creation is called Bone Dusters Paleo Ale and it is said to taste sweet and fairly much like Belgium beer.

Jason Osborne, of Paleo Quest, worked with a brewing scientist called Jason Akerboom from the Lost Rhino Brewing Company to create his unusual tipple, which includes yeast found on a 35-million-year-old whale fossil.

The pair had worked before at a biomedical research centre in Ashburn, Virginia.

Yeast, which is responsible for converting sugar to alcohol, is found in many places and using swabs and petri dishes, the duo discovered that it is found on the surface of fossils, Scientific American reported.

Yummy: The scientific beer-brewing duo had ambitiously hoped that the wild yeast was a completely new strain, but instead of a new species, they captured a previously-unknown subspecies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (pictured), which is well known to breweries and wineries

Mr Akerboom originally planned on extracting ancient yeast samples from inside pieces of amber, which has already been attempted by another brewery in California.

But after discarding the Jurassic Park-inspired idea, the pair visited Calvert Marine Museum in Solomons, Maryland, to swab and collect dirt from fossils, according to Northern Virginia Magazine.

They collected around 20 samples in total but were initially disappointed because ‘the samples were almost 100 per cent bacteria,’ but then they noticed that one containing cells from the extinct whale bones, was fermenting.

They had ambitiously hoped that the wild yeast was a completely new strain, but instead of a new species, they captured a previously-unknown subspecies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is well known to breweries and wineries.

The new variant is called Saccharomyces cerevisiae var protocetus after the protocetid whale fossil from which they took the swabs.

The duo fed the yeast with wort from the brewery’s ‘Faceplant IPA’ recipe and let the mixture ferment for a few weeks.

Mr Akerboom told MailOnline: 'We did two test batches with the yeast I isolated from the fossil bone from the Calvert Museum and we are going to make a big batch on the April 17.

The brewery in Ashburn, will be serving Bone Dusters Paleo Ale in their tasting room.

'It will also be served in Washington DC and in northern Virginia, at our normal outlets - local restaurants and bars,' he said.

'The yeast seems quite wild and untamed, and the flavour is very Belgianesque.'

A portion of the profits from the venture are being donated to a fund that gives science equipment to underprivileged schools.

The pair hope to collect wild yeast from south eastern Virginia’s Great Dismal Swamp and come up with more palaeontology-themes beers.
