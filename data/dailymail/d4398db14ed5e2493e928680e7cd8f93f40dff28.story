Red Bull team principal Christian Horner has warned Mercedes to enjoy their success while they can as he is determined to wrest back the Formula One constructors' championship next season.

After four years of domination in the sport, Red Bull's reign as champions officially came to an end in Russia on Sunday.

On the back of their ninth one-two of the campaign - one short of McLaren's record set in 1988 - Mercedes captured the constructors' crown for the first time in their long motorsport history.

Red Bull's Christian Horner has warned Mercedes that his team will be back stronger next year

Horner was always aware the day would come, almost from the first day of pre-season given the woes of their own power-unit supplier Renault.

Plagued by countless problems, Red Bull barely covered any mileage in pre-season testing, yet despite that they are certain to finish as runners-up, with Daniel Ricciardo winning three races.

Paying respect to Mercedes' performance, Horner said: 'Congratulations to Mercedes and all their guys who have designed and made the power unit. They've done a really incredible job this year.

'They're deserving champions, with the constructors' trophy going 12 miles up the road.'

With a smile, Horner added: 'We've had a little bit of time to get our heads round it - from February in reality.

'In all honesty, Mercedes have done the best job this year, but all it does is motivate you.

'You know how much work goes into winning a championship, and to win it four times in a row is an enormous achievement.

'We've had a disastrous year, but we're still second and we're the only (other) team to have won a grand prix, and three of them at that this year.

'What we've managed to recover out of this season, and the fact we have managed to take them this far into it, is very much a result in itself.'

Horner, though, is eager to ensure Mercedes' time as champion is as short-lived as possible.

'Hopefully next year we'll put up a good fight to try and get it back to Milton Keynes,' said Horner.

'Hopefully as the power units converge into next season we should be able to give them a much bigger fight.'
