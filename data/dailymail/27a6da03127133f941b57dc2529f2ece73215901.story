Pupils in England are among the worst-behaved in the developed world, research has found.

The Government and Ofsted ‘seriously underestimate’ the scale of classroom indiscipline, which affects nearly all schools, says a study.

Even many institutions which are popular and over-subscribed are plagued by bad behaviour.

Schools with the worst problems face serious disruption every day – pupils screaming obscenities, threatening staff, swearing, spitting and refusing to behave when asked. Poor parenting and pressure on schools to avoid expelling troublemakers are thought to be fuelling the crisis.

But the Department for Education and Ofsted seem unaware of the extent of classroom disruption – claiming that behaviour in 99.7 per cent of schools is satisfactory.

Professor Terry Haydn, an education expert at the University of East Anglia, cited international evidence that teachers in England face more difficult pupil behaviour than in many rival nations.

His research highlighted findings from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development which administers the world’s biggest education survey, known as PISA. OECD members include most of the world’s wealthy nations.

‘Some data from PISA research …  suggests that teachers in England may be teaching in more difficult contexts than their counterparts elsewhere,’ his report says.

England, for example, slumped to 32nd place out of 38 for the proportion of students who reported that ‘their teachers never or rarely have to wait long for them to quieten down’.

A further PISA report found that in England, 31 per cent of pupils report that ‘in most or all lessons there is noise and disorder’.

Professor Haydn suggests the poor behaviour may partly explain the superior performance of countries such as China and Japan in international school tests.

Many lessons in England are simply designed to keep control and involve ‘defensive’ strategies such as using textbooks and worksheets or showing the pupils a television programme, he says.

Testimonies from teachers paint a disturbing picture of behaviour in some schools

His paper, published today in the journal Review of Education, is based on four studies conducted over ten years. Three focused on teacher perspectives of behaviour while the fourth surveyed 700 secondary school pupils.

Testimonies from teachers paint a disturbing picture of behaviour in some schools. One said: ‘It is a condition of working at this school that you have to face serious disruption on a daily basis, pupils screaming obscenities, refusing to comply with requests to stop appalling behaviour, threatening, spitting, swearing.

‘You feel wretched for the poor kids who would like to learn.’

Professor Haydn’s study found that ‘at least to some extent, behaviour was an issue which affected most schools’. It added: ‘One of the most striking aspects of the teacher testimony was the number of teachers who had obtained posts in popular, over-subscribed schools, but nonetheless admitted to having to work hard to get complete control of some of their classes.’

It also exploded the myth that poor behaviour is mainly a problem in inner-city schools.

‘Small semi-rural schools also encountered significant problems with poor pupil behaviour,’ it said.

Professor Haydn said Department for Education claims – based on Ofsted findings – that behaviour in 99.7 per cent of schools was satisfactory, and good or better in 92 per cent, were misleading.
