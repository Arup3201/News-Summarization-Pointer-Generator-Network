A son whose no-nonsense dad gave him a fitting punishment for being a bully - and sent his story viral - has seen the error of his ways.

Kayden Robenhorst, 13, said 'thank you, I deserved that' to dad Timothy, who surprised him with a run, 60 push-ups and gardening chores at 4am in freezing Green Bay, Wisconsin, after finding out he'd been mistreating a classmate.

A photograph showing Kayden and Timothy posing with a sign explaining his sentence has been shared thousands of times online.

Spelling it out: Timothy Robenhorst was shocked to heard his son, Kayden, had been bullying somebody at school - so devised the above punishment for him

From above: Kayden said of the punishment 'I learned my lesson, and he's a good dad for doing it' 

Another condition of the punishment is that it remains Kayden's own Facebook profile picture and cover photo until Robenhorst relents.

The surprise punishment, carried out Wednesday in 32-degree weather, came after Timothy got wind that his son had insulted a classmate, and later pushed him into a locker while walking between classes.

Robenhorst, who heard what had happened from friends, decided not to let his son know in advance, but sprang the punishment on him at 4am.

After sitting him down and explaining what was about to happen, he dressed him up, stood over him during the push-ups then sent him out on the run.

Describing the experience to DailyMail.com, Kayden said: 'It was stupid of me - I saw a kid and said a stupid, random comment.'

'When he found up, he woke me up at 3:30 in the morning, and he sat me down on the couch. And when I didn't come up with a good enough excuse to save my butt, I told the truth.

'He made me do 50 knuckle push-ups, run a mile, then come back and do incline push-ups. And I'm still not done.'

'I think it's a really good punishment - I learned my lesson and he's a good dad for doing it.' 

The two planned to have Kayden apologize to the boy in question in front of his whole class, but school authorities decided a private meeting would be a better solution.

Kayden also apologized a second time when there were no teachers and parents around.

Speaking about his high-profile parenting, Robenhorst said: 'He understood - he knows it was wrong and there have been no hard feelings since.'

'He actually has said "Thank you, I deserved that, I understand it was wrong." I believe he also apologized to the child another time the other day.'

'He didn't question his punishment - he had a look on his face, you can see he wasn't very happy when he was getting his picture taken - but it's been successful.'

'And seeing it go around the way it's been going around - I would do anything to put this out there and say "Hey, don't let your child get away with this crap". Even small bullying can turn into something big.' 

Apology: Kayden was made to say sorry to his victim in front of his whole class at Pulaski Middle School, pictured

Kayden, who lives with Robenhorst, who is a business consultant, and his wife, used to live with his mother in South Carolina, where he had a difficult past.

But his father said he has seen him transform since coming north, and is now doing well at Pulaski Middle School.

Under the original post, Robenhorst had written: 'I teach my kids they do not start fights but if someone puts their hands on them they finish it.

'This is what happens when you become a bully! I don't put up with it and at 4:30am today my son found out what happens when you pray on people for no reason and bully!

'Please share this to end this behavior everywhere! Nothing changes until you take a stance and it only takes one person to start a revolution!'

Kayden concurs, adding: 'It's a good message and I hope lots of people see it'.
