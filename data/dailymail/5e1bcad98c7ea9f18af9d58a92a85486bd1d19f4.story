This is the heart-stopping moment a dare-devil, who is just inches from death, climbs to the top of a thin metal framed crane without a harness before balancing at the top while looking down.

James Kingston is seen scaling the 12 storey crane at a building site in Southampton before standing at the top and then leaping on to a nearby roof.

This is despite the fact that just one wobble or gust of wind would have been enough to send him plummeting down to the road below.

James Kingston who scaled the 12 storey thin metal crane in Southampton without the use of a harness or any safety gear 

On reaching the top of the crane, the 24-year-old balances at the top, knowing a gust of wind or a slight wobble would send him plummeting to the ground 

Once steadying himself, Mr Kingston stands tall and looks down to the street below with the footage captured on his head camera 

The video of his exploits was captured on a head camera and after being posted to Youtube has already racked up 50,000 views.

The 24-year-old started free-running seven years ago after being inspired by a documentary on the past time.

He said: 'I get a huge sense of freedom, it's super peaceful as I do most stuff at around 5am and I just have this massive appreciation for life.

The footage, which was posted on Youtube, shows Mr Kingston approaching the building site before running over to scaffolding and beginning to climb up it 

Mr Kingston has climbed many tall buildings and began the dangerous past time after being impressed by seeing a documentary on free-running 

The free-runner says he doesn't consider himself to be reckless when climbing the buildings and says he is careful no to damage them 

'People assume I run off adrenaline and get some kind of 'rush' from it but it's not like that at all.

'Some people can't understand it and therefore are afraid of it and want to get rid of it as soon as they can.

'I'm not reckless, I care about what I'm doing and we're careful not to damage the buildings we're on.'

Mr Kingston, who is from Southampton, has scaled many high buildings and says dangling hundreds of feet above cities allows him to fulfil his creative potential.

It's not the first time Mr Kingston has climbed a crane in his home city as last year he hung from a 250ft structure with just one hand as he captured the terrifying challenge on camera.

It took him twenty minutes to climb to the dizzying heights and the video was subsequently viewed by over three million people. 

He added: 'I wasn't scared. You can't afford to be scared when you're hanging by your fingertips. I did it for the adventure.'

'I didn't go up there to die. I went up there to live.'

Last week, he was in Dubai where he climbed the city's second tallest building, The Princess Tower, a 101-storey residential building in the Marina district.

The video of Mr Kingston scaling the crane has been posted to Youtube and has already had nearly 50,000 views in just four days 

Just last week, Mr Kingston was spotted in Dubai, where he climbed the city's second tallest building, The Princess Tower, a 101-storey residential building 

After reaching the top, the climber spots the roof of one of the buildings and decides to jump down towards it, even though he has no harness 

But the authorities in the city were unimpressed by his stunt and he was arrested, although he was eventually freed without charge.

He was also detained by authorities in Ukraine in April after climbing to the top of the Moscow Bridge in Kiev, and performing a back flip.  

Mr Kingston, a student, shot to fame last year when a video of him hanging one-handed from a crane in Cambridge went viral on the Internet. 

Now his YouTube channel boasts nearly 83,000 subscribers and his Facebook page almost 100,000 likes from people eager to watch his next death-defying stunts.
