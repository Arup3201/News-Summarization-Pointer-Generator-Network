Real Madrid star James Rodriguez denies any tension in the squad if now fit again Gareth Bale immediately walks back into the side.

The Welsh forward made his first Real Madrid appearance in a month, replacing Rodriguez after an hour, during the 1-0 Champions League victory over Liverpool on Tuesday.

Carlo Ancelotti's side have won 12 matches in a row in all competitions to go top of La Liga and Rodriguez welcomes Bale back into the free scoring attack at Los Blancos.

'We've played well in recent games - that's seven or eight top-class performances in a row in which we've scored a lot of goals,' the Colombian told reporters after the Liverpool match.

'We have to keep it up, though there's a long way to go until the trophies are handed out, but we have to carry on in this vein.

'Nobody gets angry (about making way for Bale). He is a great player and if he has to play, he'll always do well. We have to be ready for and open to all possible eventualities.'
