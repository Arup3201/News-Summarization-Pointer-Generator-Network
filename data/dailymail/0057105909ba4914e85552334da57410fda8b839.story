The man who killed his 9-year-old son during a supervised visit Sunday apparently did so to spite the boy's mother, authorities said.

54-year-old Muni Savyon was meeting with his son Joshua and a counselor at the YWCA in Manchester, New Hampshire when he brought out a hand gun and shot his son several times before turning the weapon on himself. The counselor escaped unharmed.

'There's a lot of sadness and also anger on the part of everyone involved that a father would take his son's life for no other reason than apparently to spite his mother,' New Hampshire Assistant Attorney General Jeffery Strelzin told the Boston Herald.

Dead: Muni Savyon shot and killed his 9-year-old son Joshua Sunday during a supervised parental visit at a YWCA in Manchester, New Hampshire

The boy's mother had dropped Joshua off at the YWCA around 9:30am and was not in the building when the shooting happened.The organization is open on Sundays for supervised child visitation and custody exchanges.The couple's marital status wasn't clear: Savyon's rabbi said the couple were divorced while law enforcement officials said the two were separated.

Muni, a software engineer, sent an email to a friend suggesting he was suicidal before the shootings. He had a troubled relationship with the boy's mother and threatened to kill them and himself before.

Response: Police arrived to the scene quickly and in force after 10am Sunday, forming a perimeter

Shooter: Not knowing whether the shooter was alive or dead, police raided the building in a strategic manner

Intent: Savyon had threatened to kill himself, his son and the boy's mother before

'She had reservations which is why he was having supervised visits,' Strelzin said.

Savyon  also recently lost his younger brother who suffered a heart attack in their home country of Israel.

His
rabbi, Levi Krinsky of Chabad Lubavitch, said the man was depressed 
when he returned from Israel to bury his brother but that no one 
expected he was capable of killing his own son.

Motive: Savyon's rabbi, Levi Krinsky, said the man had become depressed after his younger brother died in Israel recently from a heart attack

'He was just very broken, which I thought was directly related to his brother's passing,' Rabbi Krinsky told the Boston Globe. 'Did I think he was suicidal? No. Did I think he was dangerous? Not in the slightest. Apparently this is what he was thinking. End it all.'

Savyon's ex-wife Ellen Vig - not the boy's mother - got a copy of the suicide email written in Hebrew which she says spells out his intentions and what he wants done with his property.

Vig divorced Savyon in 1997, but remained friends with her ex-husband. She described him as a kind-hearted person who loved his son and tried to give the boy varied experiences. 

'He was non-violent. He would try to help anyone he could. He was a really nice guy,' she said from her home in North Billerica, Massachusetts.

Police and emergency services responded at approximately 10:30 a.m. to a
report of shots fired inside the YWCA in Manchester, New Hampshire

Families: On Sundays the YWCA is open for supervised child visitation and custody exchanges

Savyon was active in Libertarian causes, Vig said, and was a twice-defeated candidate for the New Hampshire Legislature, most recently in February.

Current New Hampshre State Representative Peter Sullivan said Savyon was a political hopeful in years past

‘Muni Savyon was my opponent in the special election a few years back,’ Sullivan, who easily beat Savyon, wrote on his Facebook Sunday. ‘He was a gracious opponent. I am utterly stunned at the news concerning this morning's horrific events.’

Born in Israel, Savyon was a naturalized citizen who lived in several Western states before coming to New England, where he worked as a software engineer, Vig said.

Others were inside the YWCA building when the shots were fired partway through the one-hour visitation. The counselor who was present at the time managed to escape unarmed, officials said.

The YWCA issued a statement late Sunday saying its 'thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends of all those involved in this incident.'

Perhaps most tragic is that the 
incident could have been prevented if the organization had enough money 
to hire security officers - something they've done in the past.

'There wasn't any security in place other than the fact that there was a counselor in the room,' Strelzin said.
'They've had security in the past and were able to hire police 
officers, but because of budget cuts they haven't been able to do that 
recently.
