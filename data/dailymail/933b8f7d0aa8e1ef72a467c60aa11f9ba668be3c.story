Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we learned from the Premier League and Football League this week, including how one Argentine is consigning another to distant memory at the Etihad.

1) Carlos Tevez, once the biggest and most controversial name at Manchester City, continues to be pushed deeper into the club’s history books by the goal scoring of fellow Argentine Sergio Aguero.

Match of the Day highlighted the fact that Aguero’s goal at Aston Villa – his 57th in the Premier League since arriving in England – made him at 114 minutes per strike the most frequent scorer in the League’s history.

It also brought him to within two of the 59 struck for City by Tevez – at an average of 140 minutes wait per goal.

2) Nathaniel Clyne can join the England squad this week knowing he’s beaten the persistent groin injury problems which he suffered during the second part of last season.

He finished Southampton’s 1-0 defeat at Spurs as one of only nine Premier League outfield players to have played every minute in every competition for their club so far.

The 23-year-old has not played so many matches in a row for nearly 18 months.

3) Queens Park Rangers might be a tad too nice for the Premier League – Karl Henry’s booking near the end of the 2-0 defeat at West Ham was only the ninth collected in all competitions by Harry Redknapp’s side this season.

That’s the lowest total of any top flight club – leaders Chelsea are far from having the worst disciplinary record, but the four yellow cards in their win over Arsenal took them to 20 in all competitions.

4) Alan Pardew tried to get rid of Gabriel Obertan this summer but literally couldn’t give him away after the French winger, troubled by hamstring injuries and poor form, had played just 34 minutes of Premier League football all last season.

The Toon boss might just end up being glad of that after the performance the 25-year-old gave at Swansea in his first top flight start of this campaign.

The former Manchester United player, who has two seasons left on the five-year contract he signed at Newcastle in 2011, set up one goal and made two more chances with a bright right wing display.

5) Andrew Robertson wasn’t the most glamorous of Hull’s summer signings, but the Scottish full back is blossoming as one of Steve Bruce’s best bits of talent spotting.

The 20-year-old, who cost £2.85million after playing only 36 games for Dundee United, set up one goal and made three more chances with his crossing in the 2-0 win over Crystal Palace.

He can defend too – winning 100 per cent of his tackles and condemning Jason Puncheon to an afternoon where he gave the ball away 31 times.

6) Uwe Rosler will be hoping that Wigan owner Dave Whelan is too wrapped up this week following the town’s Rugby League club to Saturday’s Grand Final against St Helens to notice how badly his side are performing.

The German, touted as the next big thing when he took the Latics into the play-offs last season, has collected only ten points from the first quarter of the season despite signing 11 new players in the summer.

Wigan had taken 14 points from their previous 11 games when Whelan sacked his predecessor Owen Coyle last December

7) Aussie midfielder Scott McDonald fell out with new boss Ian Holloway last January having tried, and failed, to force through a move to Hibernian.

He started only six matches for the rest of the season, and his future looked far from certain until the 31-year-old former Celtic and Middlesbrough star agreed to let bygones be bygones.

Both club and player have reaped rewards from making up. McDonald has not missed a game this term, and was outstanding for the Lions as they battled to a goalless draw away to promotion favourites Derby.

8) Former Manchester United and West Ham goalkeeper Roy Carroll is finding his feet again in English football after four years playing in Denmark and then Greece.

The 37-year-old starred in a 1-0 win over Gillingham that lifted his new club Notts County to just a point off the League One play-off places.

Carroll, likely to take his total of Northern Ireland caps to 37 in next week’s two Euro 2016 qualifying games, has now kept four clean sheets in his last seven matches.

9) Even in these days of Academies and Development Squads it is still possible for a late developer to come from the bottom rungs of the football ladder to break through.

Step up striker Charlie Walker, who made his League Two debut for Luton in the 2-1 win against local rivals Stevenage.

The 24-year-old was discovered playing for Peacehaven, a village club just up the road from Brighton, where he scored 43 goals helping win the Ryman South title and the Sussex Senior Cup.

Louis van Gaal allegedly saw that only United's half of the pitch was watered during the Everton game

He was close to a goal on his professional debut, too – with a header that manager John Still claimed had crossed the line but the ref ruled didn’t. 

10) Louis van Gaal is not averse to a bit of gamesmanship. The sprinklers at Old Trafford were switched on at half time against Everton – but only to water the half of the pitch that Manchester United would be attacking after the break.

That meant the Dutchman’s attacking stars could enjoy a slick surface to ping the ball around going forward, while his defenders would find it easier to keep their feet.
