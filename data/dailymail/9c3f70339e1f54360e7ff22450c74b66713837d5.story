A primary school could collect up to £150,000 from the sale of a painting which has hung in its hall for the past 86 years.

Captain of the Eleven by Philip 
Hermogenes Calderon, which depicts a fresh-faced Victorian boy preparing
to defend his cricket wicket,

It became one of the most famous images of the late Victorian and Edwardian period after being used in a pioneering advertising campaign to promote Pear's soap.

The much-loved painting was picked by the soap company as it represented the innocence of childhood, which was a popular theme among the Victorians who viewed children as models of truth and honesty. The little boy was deemed to look cherubic, with his flawless complexion.

Painted in 1882, at the height of 
Calderon's career, it was included in the famous Pears Annual in 1898 
and then reproduced countless times on posters, postcards and 
presentation cricket bats during the 20th century.

An English painter of French and Spanish descent Philip Hermogenes Calderon is famous for his portraits and subject pictures.

Born in Poitiers, France, his father, the Rev. Juan Calderon, was Professor of Spanish literature.

As a boy Calderon wanted to become an engineer but grew fascinated with drawing technical figures and diagrams and decided instead to study art.

He attended Leigh's art school in London before heading to Paris to study under Picot in 1851.

Calderon was the leader of the St John's Wood Clique - a group of fun-loving Victorian artists living around the St John's Wood area of London who were famous for their love of practical jokes.

Other members members included George Dunlop Leslie, Henry Stacy Marks, George Adolphus Storey, David Wilkie Wynfield, John Evan Hodgson and William Frederick Yeames.

His first works for the Royal Academy were By the Waters of Babylon (1853), followed by Broken Vows (1857) which shows a woman overhearing her lover betraying her through a garden fence.

Originally inspired by the Pre-Raphaelites, his work later encapsulated historical, biblical, and literary themes.

An 1891 painting St Elizabeth of Hungary's Great Act of Renunciation won Calderon the Chantrey bequest.

Depicting the saint bending naked over an altar watched by monks it was perceived as anti-Catholic and generated a huge amount of controversy.

The company brought art to a wider audience with their famous annual, first published in 1891, and would include large lithographs for framing.

However, the painting would never have become famous without Thomas Barratt, Pears managing director and Francis Pears' son-in-law, who first spotted the fresh-faced cricketer and realised its potential.

Known as the father of modern advertising, he also commandeered Sir John Everet Millais' iconic painting Bubbles, after seeing it in the Illustrated London News in 1886.

It then became one of the most recognisable images of the late 19th century and made the artist a global household name.

Tracey Harrison, headteacher of Thames
Primary School in Blackpool, Lancashire, said of the school's artistic 
treasure: 'It was later bought by a local councillor who presented it to
the school which was in his ward in 1926.

'We have long known it is a valuable painting, but the priority is providing the best possible facilities. 

'Ours
is a 19th-century school with some classrooms in need of modernisation 
and if the painting reaches its estimate of £100,000 to £150,000, that’s
what the money will contribute to.

'The
painting also needed restoration and as part of preparing it for sale, 
Bonhams (the auctioneer) have had it lightly cleaned and details such as
a wall and colourful flower bed behind the boy have appeared.'

Although born in France to a French 
mother and Spanish father, Calderon was the leader of a group of artists
called the St John's Wood Clique.

Their aim was to introduce a fresh 
approach to historical painting.

He began exhibiting his work at the 
Royal Academy in 1853 and became a highly regarded Royal Academician and his most famous work, Broken Vows, is in the Collection of Tate Britain.

However the Captain of the Eleven is 
already attracting plenty of interest, according to Bonhams’ director of
19th-century paintings, Peter Rees, in part because of its important 
association with early advertising.

Home for 86 years: The painting found an unlikely home in the hall of Thames Primary School in Blackpool, Lancashire

He said: 'Pears 
pioneered modern advertising techniques using images to reinforce the 
qualities they wanted the public to associate with the product.'

He added: 'It was bought by Pears’ managing director Thomas Barratt, who was skilled at spotting works that might help in the marketing of their famous brand of clear soap.

'It was given away free as a print in the 1898 Pears Christmas annual and became one of the most reproduced images of the early 20th century, appearing, for example, on presentation cricket bats.'

The painting will go to auction next month.
