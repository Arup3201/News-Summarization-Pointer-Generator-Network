New Yorkers love to wear black, and tennis WAG Kim Sears made sure that she stuck to the city's unofficial dress code as she cheered on boyfriend Andy Murray in the US Open on Wednesday.

While her dark outfit of a black blazer and trousers was sombre against the crowd's bright sportswear her smile lit up the Flushing Meadows stadium in Queens as Andy claimed victory against the 33-year-old Frenchman in straight sets.

Tennis WAG Kim Sears made sure that she stuck to New York's unofficial dress code of black as she cheered on boyfriend Andy Murray in the US Open on Wednesday

26-year-old Andy is through to the second round of the tennis championship after the world number three and his 
opponent were the last of any first round matches to be 
started this year.

Having
gone on shortly before 10pm three days into the Open - and with Laura 
Robson already in the third round -  he inflicted a 6-2, 6-4, 6-3 defeat
on the French lefthander in a contest that lasted 98 minutes.

Kim watched from the stands with Andy's other mega fan, his mother Judy
Murray, who wore a black and white leather jacket to complement her latest hairstyle, a chic grey pixie cut.

25-year-old Kim stuck to her favourite understated style, finishing her simple outfit
with a £329 Ted Baker Baillie bag and her signature glossy blow-dry.

The
leather tote bag comes with a detachable clutch designed for women with
last minute party plans, and no doubt the couple were planning some low
key celebrations as Andy began his defence of his US Open title in 
style.

Aspiring artist Kim has been described
by Judy Murray as 'the best thing to happen to Andy' and follows her 
boyfriend around the world to support him in his career, often with 
displays of fist-pumping and clenched teeth.

But on this humid New York night the blonde seemed relaxed and happy as her boyfriend of eight years dominated the 
court.
