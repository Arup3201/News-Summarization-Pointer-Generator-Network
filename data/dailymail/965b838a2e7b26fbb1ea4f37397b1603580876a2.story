A blushing bride who left her employers' business with 'life-threatening injuries' has been ordered to pay back less than a tenth of the money she stole to pay for her wedding.

Kirsty Lane, 30, put 25 jobs at risk when she used her position to siphon off almost £200,000 from the business to pay for the sumptuous ceremony at The Great Hall at Mains.

Now, Peter Sutton, company director of Pure AV in Walton Summit, near Preston, said the order to repay just £17, 831 was 'extremely disappointing', adding: 'I hope she has learnt her lesson.'

With magicians, a harpist and a spectacular firework display, no expense was spared for the lavish wedding of Kirsty and Graham Lane.

Smiling for the photographer, Lane, looked every bit the happy bride as she tied the knot at the lavish ceremony.

But Lane’s smiles hid a secret which was soon to be uncovered - this spectacular celebration was to cost two of her colleagues their jobs and put her employers’ business under threat.

She has now been ordered to pay back less than a tenth of the money she stole from the business, which boss Mr Sutton said was left in a difficult position following the fraud.

Lane's former boss Peter Sutton (pictured) said that her 'unbridled greed' had almost ruined his audio visual business

He said: 'At the time it had a huge bearing on the operation of the company.

'A few people lost their jobs but we are flourishing now, despite having life-threatening injuries a few years ago.

'It is very disappointing considering she has gained so much and had to pay back so little.

'Her guilt has put at risk 25 people that were involved in this business.

'Thankfully the team that was involved has pulled together and pulled the organisation out of it.

'It hasn’t been easy and that theft in reality cost us around £300,000 but fortunately we are now flourishing.'

Lane, of Adlington, was jailed for 20 months after her scam was uncovered within days of her wedding in January 2011.

Using her role as a financial administrator, Lane siphoned almost £200,000 from her employers, splashing out on a free bar for her guests, home improvements and even jewel-encrusted iPhone covers for her bridesmaids.

But suspicions were aroused when a customer queried an invoice and Lane was suspended pending an investigation.

Lane made 122 payments to herself between December 2008 and January 2011, with around £122,000 went into her own account.

A further £70,000 went into her husband’s account and a further £6,000 was paid into a third account.

Mr Lane was acquitted of any wrongdoing after a retrial in May and Lane herself had 'exonerated' her husband of any wrongdoing.

The couple met in 2007 and Mr Lane had travelled up from his home in Luton to move in with the single parent and her daughter in August 2010.

At her trial last year Lane pleaded guilty to 10 counts of fraud by abuse of position and asked for a further 112 similar offences to be taken into consideration.
