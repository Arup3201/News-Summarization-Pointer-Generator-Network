She's one of the most polished A-listers in Tinseltown so it comes as little surprise that Victoria Beckham is passing on her beautifying tips to daughter Harper.

The fashion designer has revealed that she and her three-year-old often have 'nail afternoons' - and they're not the only members of the family to enjoy some pampering. 

Speaking to Vogue magazine, the mother-of-four said: 'I'm very girly and I love nails. Harper and I will often have nail afternoons and when we're in LA, we even send our dog to a nail spa called The Beauty Spot for a paw-pedicure.'

Perfectly polished: Victoria Beckham, who recently unveiled her collaboration with Nails Inc, has revealed that she and her three-year-old daughter Harper often have 'nail afternoons'

The 40-year-old was promoting the new luxury nail polish duo she created in collaboration with Nails Inc.

The two limited-edition shades - a warm tomato red and a pale bone hue - are inspired by the designer's yet-to-be unveiled Victoria Victoria Beckham spring/summer 2015 collection.

While we saw the main Victoria Beckham collection at New York Fashion Week in September, the new polishes offer us a first hint of what Mrs Beckham has in store for her second fashion line next season. 

According to a press release, the upcoming VVB collection features subtle nods to Japanese culture, and this is certainly reflected in the nail polish names - Judo Red and Bamboo White.

Beauty collaboration: Victoria Beckham's nail polish duo with Nails Inc was one of her highs of 2014

The exclusive formulation of the new nail varnishes features silica-rich bamboo extract, which apparently conditions and feeds the nail bed with essential nutrients.

She and Harper both love the orangey red shade. 'I choose it when I'm wearing something uncomplicated, like all black,' she added.

The collaboration is a final highlight in what has been a busy - and successful - year for Mrs Beckham.

The designer was given the prestigious Best Brand award at the British Fashion Awards 2014.

Proving all of her early critics wrong, Victoria Beckham has doubled sales of her fashion business to £30.39million in just two years.

The businesswoman reported sales of £15.76million in 2012. And according to The Sun, Victoria Beckham Ltd made a £1.3m profit in 2013 - selling £83,000 worth of stock (or 55 handbags priced at £1,500) per day.

The designer, who debuted her first collection of dresses at New York Fashion Week in 2008, has expanded her business to include handbags, shoes, sunglasses, denim, a sister line titled Victoria Victoria Beckham, and even a luxury nail polish collection in collaboration with Nails Inc.

The rising sales are thought to be thanks to her recently launched website and her September store opening on Dover Street in Mayfair, London, where hundreds of fans waited in line for the doors to open.
