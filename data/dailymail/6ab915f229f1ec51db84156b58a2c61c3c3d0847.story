Sheik Mohammed has dramatically reshuffled his jockey plans for 2015 by signing up William Buick and James Doyle, two of the Weighing Rooms’ brightest talents, for his Godolphin empire.

Buick will ride the Godolphin horses trained by Charlie Appleby while Doyle will partner those under the care of Saeed Bin Suroor.

Both jockeys will provide crossover cover when required.

In addition, they will also ride Godolphin horses with John Gosden and other trainers which have until now run in the colours of the Sheik’s wife Princess Haya.

Mickael Barzalona will continue to ride Godolphin horses trained in France but Silvestre De Sousa’s position as a Godolphin jockey has ended.

Godolphin riding plans have been unsatisfactory since the ending of Frankie Dettori’s 18-year association.

Shamed by last year’s Mahmood Al Zarooni Anabolic Steroid scandal, they have endured a poor 2014 in Europe with the Middle Park Stake victory of Appleby’s Buick-ridden Charming Thought their sole success at Group One Level.

It is a meagre return for such a lavishly funded operation and one coming under further pressure from the increased involvement of Qatari owners in British racing.

Signing Buick and Doyle is a statement of intent from the Sheik, as was spending over £20million on yearlings at the prestigious Tattersalls Book 1 sale.

The capture of Doyle is most surprising. He has walked away from the job as first jockey to Prince Khaled Abdullah, owner of this year’s champion miler Kingman and Champion Stakes winner Noble Mission.

Doyle said: ‘I have had a wonderful season riding for Juddmonte and Prince Khaled during which I was fortunate to ride the best horse of my career so far in Kingman.

‘Noble Mission was another great racehorse produced by Juddmonte that helped bring my career forward.

‘I shall always be eternally grateful for that one-year contract which leaves me with great memories. Now I look forward to sharing riding duties with William at Godolphin and continue to achieve great things in the world of horse racing.’

Buick added: ‘I have been very fortunate to have been employed by John Gosden since I completed my apprenticeship and without his faith and wise counsel I would not be in the position that I am in today to take what is, in my opinion, the most coveted position in world racing.

‘John has shown me great loyalty and given me access to Classic winners and success on a world stage. No jockey has had a better mentor. Now I am looking forward to sharing the Godolphin riding arrangements with my very good friend James.

‘Both of us have had to make hard decisions but no one has made a commitment to world racing like Sheik Mohammed and it is an honour for both of us to be invited to be a part of his team.’

Buick and Doyle flew out of Heathrow on Saturday evening to meet the Sheik in Dubai.

His bloodstock adviser John Ferguson said: ‘This is yet another clear indication of Godolphin’s pursuit of excellence in both horses and humans.
