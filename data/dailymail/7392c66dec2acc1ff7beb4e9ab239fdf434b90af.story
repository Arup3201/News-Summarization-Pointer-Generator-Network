Allergy: Jenny Pomeroy died from a severe reaction to the venom of a fire ant sting

A 65-year-old woman has died after having an allergic reaction from a fire ant sting as she relaxed by her swimming pool in Georgia.

Jenny Pomeroy, who went into anaphylactic shock after being stung at her condo last week, died in hospital from complications related to the reaction.

The grandmother, who had been chief executive of a blind charity for 17 years, knew she was allergic to the ants' venom and carried an autoinjector, but she couldn't be saved.

'This is just so hard to believe and unexpected,' Laurie Irby, who worked with Mrs Pomeroy at Prevent Blindness Georgia, told ABC News.

Mrs Pomeroy, who was chief executive officer of the Atlanta charity, had been treated in hospital 20 years ago after an allergic reaction to the ants.

'Jenny knew that she was allergic to fire ants and was always very aware of her surroundings,' Ms Irby said.Â 

For most people, a fire ant sting will cause welts, itching and swelling, but for those who are allergic to the venom, it can cause vomiting, difficulty breathing and swallowing and, in extreme cases, a fatal drop in blood pressure.

Mrs Pomeroy carried an epinephrine autoinjector, which quickly delivers life-saving drugs into the blood stream, and her husband immediately called 911 when his wife was stung at their condo after work.

A statement released to neighbors at her Buckhead condo said: 'We all feel the terrible sorrow for the loss of our close personal friend and board president.'

The co-chairmen of Prevent Blindness Georgia, Scott Pastor and Amy Hutchinson, released a statemement on Tuesday saying: 'Jenny
will forever be remembered as an innovative thinker and a selfless, 
dedicated leader in Atlanta and across the state of Georgia. We will 
miss her deeply.'

Atlanta has a big problem with fire ants, which are believed to have arrived in the U.S. in the 1930s on board trade ships.

They can now be found in 13 states, including Georgia, and are believed to be the number one cause of insect bites in the U.S. They bite their victim to get a good grip before injecting the venom.

For people with an allergy, the reaction becomes more severe with age.

However, an allergist at the Atlanta Allergy and Asthma clinic, said many people were not aware that those who are allergic to the venom can be given a course of treatment to build up their immunity.

'The best treatment is allergy 
shots because they're very effective at helping 
patients build a tolerance so that when they're stung again, they don't 
have a reaction,' Dr Stanley Fineman said.

The shots carry small but increasing doses of the venom to help patients build up an immunity over five years.

More than 500,000 Americans seek emergency treatment for insect stings each year and about 40 are killed from insect sting anaphylaxis, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology.
