London's flood defence system was activated yesterday for the first time since 2010 as Britain's wet weather threatens to bring flooding to the capital.

The Environment Agency raised the Thames Barrier yesterday morning to prevent flooding from the current tides as extra rainfall, which has fallen further up the River Thames, flows downstream.

It came as forecasters warned yet more downpours and storms are on the way to bring a soggy end to the wettest year in England since records began in 1910.

The flood gates have been raised due to a combination of a high tide and extra rainfall further up the River Thames which could cause flooding in London

The record for the whole of the UK 
will be broken if, as seems likely, just over 1.8in more rain falls on 
Britain by the end of the year on Monday.

With 50.8in having fallen on the UK 
up to December 26, that is all it will take to beat the 52.6in that fell
in 2000, the UK's wettest year so far.

The record for England has already been set with the 43.1in of rain that had fallen by Boxing Day, the Met Office said.

Heavy rain is expected to fall in 
many parts of the country today followed by storms with sleet and even 
snow over the weekend. A storm brewing in the Atlantic could bring up to
two inches of rain and 90mph winds in some areas.

That could extend the nightmare of 
hundreds of home and business owners who have seen their property 
repeatedly damaged by floods, with the South West hit particularly 
badly.

Yesterday the Thames Barrier was 
closed for the first time in two years to prevent flooding to low-lying 
areas of London. The Environment Agency raised the defence system to 
stop floodwaters from further upstream meeting a high tide last night.

A forecaster for MeteoGroup said: 
'New bands of rain will sweep across Britain from west to east bringing 
some heavy showers. There will be some sunshine and clearer skies on 
Saturday but it will be a stormy weekend and noticeably wet and windy.

'Winds will reach up to 50mph in the North and West of the UK, and up to 90mph along the west coast of Scotland.

'It's going to be a wet and stormy end to the year.'

Paddington and Heathrow Airport or Reading, and delays to services in 
the East Midlands and parts of Scotland and Wales.

of flooding continues.

However, the agency has removed 76 flood warnings and alerts in the last 24 hours.

Back in April that barely seemed imaginable with Britain in the midst of the worst drought since 1976.

More than 20million people were subject to a hosepipe ban as the Environment Agency drew up contingency plans believing the drought could last until Christmas.

But after the wettest summer in 100 years, Britain's climate swung back the other way.

Professor Tim Palmer, from the University of Oxford, told the BBC the topsy-turvy conditions are the result of changes in the movement of the Atlantic jet stream which travels to our shores from America.

'When the jet stream moves up to the north, and then travels back down to the UK, it brings with it cold air, blizzards, very severe and unpleasant weather from that perspective,' he said.

Professor Palmer predicted Britain will see more extreme patterns of weather with periods of drought followed by flooding and cold weather as the jet stream continues to be affected by climate change.

'The question of how it will change is still a very active research problem, and we don't have clear-cut answers yet.

'But I think there is quite a big possibility that what we will see is the jet stream undergoing quite dramatic and erratic excursions.'
