John Harbaugh's Baltimore Ravens fought their way to a Super Bowl victory on Sunday - but that was the easy part.

Moments after the game ended, the Ravens head coach crossed the field to meet with his arch rival for the game - his little brother Jim, the coach of the defeated San Francisco 49ers.

And he greeted him with a slap to the face - no doubt just as he did when they were kids.

'The end of the game was the hardest thing I ever experienced,' John Harbaugh told CBS on the victory podium.

Concerned: Jack and Jackie Harbaugh, the parents of the two coaches, made sure to wear neutral colors during the Super Bowl - because they refused to take sides

The Super Bowl showdown between to brothers - dubbed by some the Har-bowl - could only end with one brother losing.

Jim - the more animated and fiery of the two brothers - victorious brother John that he was proud of him.

John responded with 'I love you.'

From the stands, nervous parents Jack and Jackie Harbaugh watched their sons duke it out on the gridiron.

As promised, they wore neutral colors - giving away no hint over whether they supported on son over the other.

Mrs Harbaugh anticipated the moment after the game and said she expected the coaches will both come away friends.

'We will see both of them after the 
game. Weâ€™re going to hug both of them and tell them how proud we are of 
them and their teams,' she said during a press conference last week.

John Harbaugh, 50, and his younger brother Jim, 49, have been competing against each other ever since they were kids.

The family recounted a story to NFL.com how when they'd all be hanging out in the family's Michigan basement, Jack would ask both sons to run upstairs for refreshments and time them to see who was quickest.

'He'd say, 'Okay, John you're up. Jim had a 17-second world record the last time he went. He'd tear up those stairs and I'd be right there, hoping he didn't break my record,' Jim recalled.

John noted that, 'They were always really close races. It was amazing.'
