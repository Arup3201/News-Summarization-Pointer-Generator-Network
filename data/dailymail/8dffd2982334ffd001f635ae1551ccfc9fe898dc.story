Eleven passenger planes were forced to make Mayday calls to land at UK airports last year because they were running low on fuel, it has emerged.

New figures reveal that a total of 11 planes had to radio an emergency call to schedule an earlier landing because fuel supplies on the aircraft were so low.

A further 100 passenger jets were also caught 'flying on empty', but they didn't have to make Mayday calls, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) figures show.

It means a total of 111 planes ended up running low on fuel during flights in 2014 – almost double the 58 British-registered planes which recorded low fuel levels in 2013.

However, in comparison, the number of Mayday calls issued because of low fuel last year was two fewer than the 13 made in 2013. 

One operator, which the CAA did not name, was responsible for 35 of the 111 reports of low fuel in 2014 - which equates to almost a third.

Another carrier was responsible for 12 incidents, while another was accountable for 10. A total of 36 operators were deemed responsible for the entire 111 incidents.

London's Heathrow Airport experienced the highest number of reports of low fuel incidents in 2014, the figures show.

A total of 19 commercial planes, of mixed nationality, were found to be flying low on fuel as they approached the west London airport.

In comparison, there were 13 planes recorded at London Gatwick, four planes at London Stansted, and three at both Manchester and Edinburgh.

Planes in UK airspace are required to have enough fuel to complete their journey,  have enough to reach another airport in case of a diversion, circle an airport for 30 minutes if necessary and still have a final emergency reserve, which is equivalent to five per cent of the plane's original upload of fuel.

All UK operators have a legal obligation to report safety issues and a low fuel declaration falls within that scope, meaning all carriers are forced to declare when an aircraft's fuel has not met the requirement. 

Some airlines have allegedly been cutting the amount of fuel they carry to make the aircraft lighter and save money. Others suffer fuel shortages during extreme weather when flight patterns are disrupted or aircraft are unable to land because of adverse conditions.

A spokesman for the UK Civil Aviation Authority told MailOnline: 'European airlines have a legal responsibility to carry a set minimum level of fuel, enough for the aircraft to carry out its planned journey and cope with any potential issues during the flight.

'However, in very rare circumstances, for example extreme weather, an aircraft may burn fuel faster than calculated. In most cases the aircraft simply lands with less fuel than expected.

'Occasionally, however, the flight crew decide to request a priority landing as they approach an airport in order to maintain its final contingency reserve fuel.

'Airlines and air traffic controllers have well practiced standard operating procedures in place to deal with these situations.'

Pilots' union Balpa described the rising number of low fuel incidents as a 'matter of concern' and said pressure to remain competitive and keep fuel costs down must never compromise passenger safety.

A spokesman said: 'Aircraft flying on low fuel not only put that aircraft potentially at risk, but also impact on the wider operation. 

'Handling an aircraft on low-fuel means that other aircraft may have to hold longer to give appropriate priority to the emergency aircraft resulting in a possible "avalanche effect".

'It is natural, in such a competitive industry, for airlines to look to carry as little fuel as they can in order to save weight and save money. But that commercial pressure must never be at the expense of ensuring a safe flight.

'The CAA’s approach to safety – that of “Safety Management Systems” – is to allow airlines to make their own judgement calls on safety matters and to monitor the result. 

'Therefore we hope that the regulator has picked up the fact that one company has been responsible for 30 per cent of the low fuel incidents recorded and has reacted appropriately.'

The CAA confirmed that passengers were not in danger in any of the 111 recorded fuel incidents and said there was 'no safety risk to passengers'. 

In 2012, budget airline Ryanair was recommended to 'review' the amount of fuel it carries after three of its planes – including one from the UK - were forced to make 'Mayday' emergency landings in Spain when they started to run out of fuel.

The airline was operating with a level of fuel that was 'close to the minimum' required in the case of a diversion, watchdogs said.

Three Ryanair Boeing 737-800 aircraft heading to Madrid were forced to make emergency landings after being diverted to Valencia because of thunderstorms over the Spanish capital.

At the time, the Irish Aviation Authority Report recommended Ryanair 'reviews its fuel policy and considers issuing guidance to crew with respect to fuel when operating into busy airports with mixed aircraft operators and types, particularly in poor weather conditions when diversions are likely.'

A Ryanair spokesman said: 'The official IAA report into the three Valencia weather diversions in July 2012 confirmed that all three aircraft took extra fuel (because of adverse weather), all three aircraft flew for one hour more than scheduled (due to the diversions) and all three aircraft fully complied with EU safety regulations.'

And in October last year, a Thomas Cook flight from Fuerteventura to Newcastle landed with critically low fuel levels.

The plane landed with just 900kg of fuel left after a problem with the aircraft’s wing flaps saw meant it had to be diverted from Newcastle to land at Manchester.

The jet should have had 1,627kg of 'final reserve,' as indicated in the Air Accident Investigation Branch's report.

The diversion lowered the fuel to dangerous levels, when the pilot could have landed the Boeing 757 at Edinburgh, which was closer, or back to Newcastle once the problem was corrected.

A spokesperson for Thomas Cook Airlines told Mail Online: 'As a result of the AAIB’s and our own internal investigation, we have completely reviewed pilot training for go-around manoeuvres to ensure operating procedures are accurately followed and when necessary low fuel levels are appropriately declared to air traffic control. The aircraft landed safely at Manchester Airport.’
