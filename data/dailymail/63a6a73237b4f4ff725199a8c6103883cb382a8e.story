She's the face of H&M, appeared in a film shot by Baz Luhrmann for Chanel and unveiled the World Cup, so it comes as little surprise that Gisele Bundchen is the world's highest earning model.

But according to a new report, the 33-year-old, who's also a clothes horse for Carolina Herrera, Isabel Marant, Emilio Pucci and Balenciaga, has raked in a reported $47m (£27m) in the past 12 months alone.

Forbes, who have ranked the Brazilian beauty as the world's highest earning model for seven consecutive years, claim that she earns £74,000 ($128,000) every single day thanks to her work with companies such as Falabella, a Chilean department store, and Fidelia, a Korean lingerie brand.

Big bucks: Forbes, who've rank Gisele as the world's highest earning model for seven consecutive years, claim that she earns £74,000 ($128,000) every single day

The site state: 'Since Forbes began tracking Bundchen’s numbers in 2001, her estimated total earnings over the period totaled $386m (£225m) . If corrected by US inflation based on the buying power of the dollar over time, that sum goes to some $427m (£249m).

'That does not include management, agent and attorney fees, but assuming Bundchen’s been managing her cash, spending wisely and making smart investments, which seems to be the case, it’s safe to say she has amassed a respectable net worth.'

To put it into perspective, Forbes say that is almost twice as much as Brazilian football ace Ronaldo Luís Nazário de Lima's estimated net worth.

Gisele, who also has a line of sandals and lingerie range, is keen to keep her earnings private.

Earlier this year she told MdeMulher in her native Brazil: 'It's sad, because the people who write these things don't have my bank account details.

'I do OK, I earn plenty, but not as much as they say. I've already been audited by the IRS because of this list and, truthfully, whether I'm on this list or not doesn't interest me.

Gisele 
shot to fame in the late 1990s and she was credited with ending the 
'heroin chic' era exemplified by skinny, waifish models such as by Kate Moss.

Gisele was one of Victoria's Secret's most famous Angels for seven 
years and she's also had cameo roles in movies, such as Taxi and The 
Devil Wears Prada.
