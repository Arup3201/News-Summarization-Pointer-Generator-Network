Former 'Saturday Night Live' cast member Victoria Jackson has lost her bid as an independent candidate for a seat on a county commission in Tennessee.

Jackson, who calls herself a tea party conservative, moved to Thompson Station last year and said she filed as an independent to run for the Williamson County Commission because she's 'very disappointed with the Republican Party.'

The Tennessean reports Jackson received 632 votes.

Two others received more votes: Judy Lynch Herbert with 1,422 and Betsy Hester with 1,380. The County Commission has two commissioners in each of its 12 districts.

Jackson had made appearances at multiple political events in Middle Tennessee since making her home there.

A stoic Jackson wrote about the lose on her blog.

'My first reaction? Hmmm. Well, I donâ€™t really like numbers, and Commissioners mostly talk about numbers, the budget,' she said.

She went on to note that this was her first shot at an elected office and that as a short-time resident of Thompson Station she was at a disadvantage against incumbents.

But she won't let that stop her from being active in local politics.

'As their annoying constituent, I will try to share my knowledge and research with them, so they can make wise choices,' she said.

Herbert was formerly on the District 3 commission but moved to District 2 because of changes to the district map while Hester was the District 2 incumbent.

'I am very pleased,' Hester told the Tennessean. 'I want to thank all of the voters who 
turned out in early voting and all the voters who came out today in this
 heat. I pledge that I will continue to work hard for the Second 
District and will continue moving forward.'

Gracious Jackson said it might be for the best as she didn't 'like numbers' and the position dealt with budget issues
