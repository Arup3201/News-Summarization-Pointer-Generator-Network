Andre Drummond may be a talented center on the court, but you might not trust him behind the wheel.

The Detroit Pistons star has apologized for the foolish mistake of not only driving recklessly, but bragging about it with a Snapchatted picture of his speedometer edging up to 97 miles per hour on a highway with a 70 mile per hour speed limit.

He later called the picture a 'silly mistake.'

The red light on the dash indicates the seat belt is unfastened. 

'I'll own up to it and move on from here. It won't happen again,' Drummond told The Detroit Free Press. 'Silly mistake on my behalf.' 

Yahoo noted that not only was Drummond taking and posting a pic while speeding, he even took time to put an emoji in his post as well as adding text.

Plus, he wasn't wearing a seatbelt.

Pistons coach Stan Van Gundy said he wasn't worried about Drummond's use of social media, but was worried about his safety.

Drummond called the picture a 'silly mistake' 

He told reporters that it reminded him of the death of Charlotte Hornets shooting guard Bobby Philis in a 2000 accident in which excessive speed played a deadly role.

'I know you're young and you think you're indestructible, but for the people that care about you, it's scary as hell,' the coach said shortly before the team's Sunday night face off against the Oklahoma City Thunder.
