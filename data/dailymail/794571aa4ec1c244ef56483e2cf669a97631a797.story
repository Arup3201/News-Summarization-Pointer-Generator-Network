He may be famous for fighting crime, but Mr Incredible turned Bad Guy this week when he was filmed attacking Batgirl in Los Angeles.

The two superhero impersonators came to blows in front of hundreds of tourists outside TCL Chinese Theater on Hollywood Boulevard on Tuesday.

The scene was made all the more bizarre when other costumed characters in the vicinity including Star Wars' Chewbacca and Where's Wally (also known as Waldo) stepped in to break up the scuffle.

Even Nightmare on Elm Street's villainous Freddy Krueger turned hero as he attempted to protect Batgirl.

The incident was caught on camera by Filmon.com crew, who were filming nearby when the fight kicked off.

It is currently unknown what sparked the brawl, and the clip begins with the two characters already in a vicious tangle.

As the camera approaches, it follows Chewbacca as he marches over to where Mr Incredible and Batgirl are wrestling each other.

The actor dressed as Pixar's Mr Incredible is shown attempting to pin Batgirl up against the wall as she fights back, with Chewbacca attempting to pull him off of her.

A woman in a Where's Wally costume also approaches to intervene, followed by Krueger.

The video cuts to Mr Incredible attacking Batgirl again, shoving Where's Wally into the street and dangerously close to traffic when she tries to stop him. Frozen's Queen Elsa doesn't appear to do much to assist, looking on in horror.

Surrounded: LAPD say no arrests have been made or injuries reported following the incident

After Batgirl is thrown to the ground, other passersby step in to break up the brawl that has clearly gotten out of hand, surrounding Mr Incredible and yelling at him.

No arrests were made and no injuries were reported, LAPD Officer Drake Madison told KTLA. Police are continuing to investigate the incident.

This is the not the first superhero scuffle to take place in the popular tourist zone. According to CBS Los Angeles, Captain America and Spider-Man came to blows outside the Dolby Theater in May.
