Tube fan: London Mayor Boris Johnson called Nick Clegg's radio phone-in to demand Cabinet ministers ditch their 'posh limos' and use public transport

Hosting a radio phone-in to engage with the man on the street, Nick Clegg was probably expecting a broadside about ministers living the high life.

But the Deputy Prime Minister was not prepared for it to be delivered in the unmistakeable tones of a certain ‘Boris from Islington’.

London Mayor Mr Johnson called in to weekly show 'Call Clegg' on LBC to demand Cabinet ministers ditch their ‘posh limos’ and use public transport ‘like everybody else’. 

Voters would not trust the Government to build vital infrastructure while they ‘sit in their chauffeur-driven limousines paid for by the taxpayer’, he fumed. 

Mr Clegg, who instantly realised who he was speaking to, told listeners the Coalition had ‘slashed’ the budget for ministerial cars by about 70 per cent compared with Labour, and that he was about to get a train to his Sheffield constituency.

But only this week, Welsh Secretary David Jones was spotted being driven 100 yards in his Government Jaguar from his office to the gates of Downing Street.

The car waited 90 minutes while Mr Jones attended a Cabinet meeting before driving him back again.

Questioning: Boris (pictured yesterday) asked: 'How can we possibly expect the Government to vote for increases in infrastructure spending which we need in this city... when they sit in their chauffeur-driven limousines'

Transport Minister Simon Burns was 
criticised last year for overseeing inflation-busting rises in rail 
fares, while spending £80,000 a year on a chauffeur-driven car to travel
35 miles to Westminster from his home in Chelmsford.

Yesterday, Mr Johnson said in a 
pre-recorded question: ‘Hi Nick, it’s Boris here from Islington.

'I just 
want to ask you when are you going to get all those Government ministers
out of their posh limos and on to public transport like everybody else.

‘And how can we possibly expect the 
Government to vote for increases in infrastructure spending which we 
need in this city, and upgrading the Tube which we all need, when they 
sit in their chauffeur-driven limousines paid for by the taxpayer rather
than getting down on public transport with the rest of us? Boris – over
and out.’ 

Mr Clegg replied that the largest 
infrastructure project in Europe, Crossrail, was being built in London 
and the Mayor could take advantage of Treasury guarantees for other 
projects.

He added: ‘Tell him to get out of his limo and get the infrastructure projects we are offering him moving.’

David
Cameron announced a crackdown on ministerial cars, which cost more than
£10million a year under Labour, when he came into office. 

He
said: ‘If there is something that really annoys people it’s seeing 
politicians swanning around in chauffeur-driven cars like they’re the 
Royal Family.’ 

Mr Clegg 
also fielded a question about Chris Huhne, the former energy minister 
facing jail, but stopped short of asking him to return his £17,000 
ministerial severance pay.
