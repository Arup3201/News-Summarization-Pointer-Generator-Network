The exhaustive search operation for the MH370 has resumed this morning in much clearer weather, with air teams joined by both military and commercial ships as officials scramble to cover the 600,000 square-kilometre search area.

Australia is leading a new and exhaustive operation some 2,500 kilometres (1,500 miles) south-west of Perth after American satellite imagery picked up two large objects – one up to 24 metres (78ft) in length – on the outer edge of the southern search corridor.

Officials are preparing for the worst possible news, with several aviation experts now claiming the remote location of the debris would almost-certainly point to deliberate cockpit intervention, either by the pilots, the crew or passengers.

Two pieces of wreckage that are possibly from the missing Malaysian Airlines Flight 370 - one estimated to be 78ft in size - have been found to the west of Australia, it was announced today.

Aviation expert Neil Hansford says he's confident that, whether it's an act of terrorism or activism, the disappearance of MH370 was well planned

Neil Hansford, chairman of Strategic Aviation Solutions, told Network 10 this morning that he was convinced that what had happened to MH370 wasn't an accident, and said the evidence pointed to the plane's crew being involved.

'I think it's been put there either by one of the crew or both, and they've picked an area where the aircraft won't be found,' Mr Hansford said.

'This was a crew-related incident. It wasn't a catastrophic explosion. It wasn't hit by military ordnance.

'[The debris is] in about 10,000ft of water. In that part of the world there's currents.

'Whether it's terrorism or activism, it's certainly something that has been well structured and well planned.'

Mr Hansford pointed to the amount of fuel likely on board the Boeing 777-200, at nearly full capacity with 31,000 gallons instead of the 45 per cent loading required to pilot a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, as being a strong indicator that MH370's disappearance was not accidental.

He added that given the location of the debris, the plane very well could have headed for mainland Australia, blaming the co-ordination effort in Malaysia for the slow and frustrating search.

'This aircraft has been positioned to where it is; it could as easily, more frighteningly, have been positioned to the centre of Australia,' Mr Hansford said.

'[Malaysian investigators] have never had control of this incident from the time the passenger manifest was never checked against the stolen passport.

'We've only seriously been involved for really five for six days. We were all out looking in the South China Sea and the Gulf of Thailand until they realised they didn't have a clue.'

A statement from the Australian Maritime Safety Authority said four planes had searched an area of 8,800 square miles (23,000 square kilometres) about 1,550 miles (2,500m) south-west of Perth without success.

The area is about halfway between Australia and desolate islands off the Antarctic – one of the most remote locations on the planet.

The difficult search operation, led by military aircraft from Australia, New Zealand and the US, was hampered by poor visibility, challenging weather conditions and its proximity from land. But officials said the weather had cleared considerably this morning.

It takes an Australian search plane, the RAAF Aurion P3, four hours to arrive at the debris search area from Pearce air base, and the aircraft can only spend two hours scouring the area before needing to return to Perth.

Mr Hansford suggests the pilots on MH370 may have used this knowledge to their advantage and dropped the plane in a part of the ocean it would never be found.

'If I was trying to lose an aircraft, and make sure there was no evidence... you'd certainly be looking to put the aircraft it in very, very deep water a long way from land,' he said.

'In the end if it is in the area it's only going to be found by sonar and other maritime assets, not by aircraft assets.

'There's unlikely to be any naval ships in the area [for days]. You've almost been able to put it (MH370) in with little chance of anything floating up too quickly to be able to isolate the wreck.'
