The parents of a 13-year-old schoolgirl who died from a brain aneurism have published her private diaries.

Jemima Layzell collapsed suddenly at home in Horton in Somerset and later died in hospital having suffered a massive bleed on her brain in March last year.

She had expressed a wish for her organs to be donated and they were used to save the lives of eight others, as well as the sight of three people.

Angelic: The diaries of Jemima Layzell, who died suddenly last year at the age of 13, have been published into a book called The Draft by her parents Harvey, 44, and Sophy, 39, from Horton, Somerset

After her death, Jemima's parents 
Harvey, 44, and Sophy Layzell, 39, discovered her private diaries, which
 she started writing aged four, in her bedside cabinet.

Jemima had dreamed of becoming a writer when she grew up, so her parents decided to try to publish the diaries.

Her
 writing has now been made into a book, called The Draft, which has 
attracted praise from distinguished children's authors Dame Jacqueline 
Wilson and Michael Morpurgo.

Moving: The Draft is a collection of Jemima's most intimate thoughts, and her writing has been praised by leading authors Dame Jacqueline Wilson and Michael Morpurgo

Mr
 Layzell, a photographer, said the family wanted to raise awareness of 
organ donation and children hearing voices through the book.

He
 said: 'We are exceedingly proud seeing Jemima's own words in print 
especially as most of it has never been read during her lifetime.

'Sharing
 her private thoughts could be thought of as quite invasive but we 
decided to publish Jemima's diaries not just because she was so talented
 but also to raise awareness of such things as hearing voices.

'As
 a daughter she was diligent, conscientious and always strived to make 
us so proud. She was gifted creatively and enjoyed analysing and 
questioning the world around her.

'She loved playing make believe with her sister and her favourite thing was hanging out with her friends."

Jemima's
 sister, Amelia, 12, will receive half of profits from The Draft, with 
the rest going towards setting up a charitable trust in her name.

The
 teenager collapsed at home without warning during evening preparations 
for Mrs Layzell's 38th birthday party on March 10 last year.

She
 lost consciousness and was taken to Musgrove Park Hospital in Taunton 
in Somerset, and later transferred to Frenchay Hospital in Bristol.

Jemima, who attended Taunton School, died at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Children at 4.28pm on March 14.

She had previously expressed a 
wish for her organs to be donated and they saved the lives of two 
five-year-old boys, a 14-year-old girl, a ten-month old boy, a 
three-and-a-half year old boy, two people aged 19 and 24, and a 
40-year-old man.

Three people have also had their sight saved.

Thoughtful: Jemima also helped save the lives of eight people through the donation of her organs

Jemima's book, The Draft, went on sale on May 21 - what would have been her 15th birthday.

It begins: 'This diary belongs to Jemima Elizabeth Layzell. If I were a fairy I'd be called Lizzy Stardust.'

The intimate diaries share her 
thoughts about love, friendship and the future - with her secret wish 
'for someone to really, really like me for who I am'.

One
 extract reads: 'Some people say that God can't exist because if he did 
he would help all the poor people in the world. I object to that.

'I feel their despair but WE have to help them. They are there because we did this to them.

Dear Diary.It is times like this when I sit and wonder ‘where’s my Romeo? What happened to my Prince Charming?’ But then I stop and think, do I really deserve him?

...I want to leap out of bed, draw back the curtains and gaze out into the night.To lean out the window, sing for my true love, the love I do not yet possess and possibly never will. If only I weren’t so afraid.Monday 8th August 2011

Some people say that God can’t exist because if he did he would help all the poor people in the world. I object to that. I feel their despair but WE have to help them.

They are there because we did this to them. They are there because we have a wrong to right. They are there to stop us from turning into complete monsters before it’s too late.Sunday 7th August 2011

Anyway I need to write what I think and feel. Not all that you see here actually ‘happened’ but it’s still very real to me. I don’t care if I let my imagination run away with me!

Plenty of brilliant artists and writers were mad! In fact it made their work more interesting! Even if they did cut their ears off, commit suicide, run round doing crazy stuff etc etc. People still loved them and their work just the same. And I want to be loved too.

I almost feel as though I will never live long enough to become an author, to be married and have a family.

'They
 are there because we have a wrong to right. They are there to stop us 
from turning into complete monsters before it's too late.'

Mr
 Morpurgo, author of War Horse, said: 'We all have our stories to tell. 
This is Jemima's first and last and because of that so important to all 
of us who read it now. This is her life.'

Ms
 Wilson also said: 'I think it's the most beautiful, touching, 
heart-breaking book. It must be devastating to lose such a wonderful, 
talented child, but clearly this precious book is one way that she will 
live on in everyone's hearts.'

The Draft is available from Amazon and selected Waterstones stores.
