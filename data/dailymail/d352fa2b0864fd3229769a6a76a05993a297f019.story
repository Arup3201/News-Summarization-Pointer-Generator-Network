Prince Harry was mobbed by tens of thousands of adoring fans on Sydney’s famous harbour as he began his first official visit of Australia yesterday.

Screams greeted the Prince as he went on a walkabout among the excited crowds after officially attending the International Fleet Review, which involved 40 warships from 17 nations.

Despite being in Australia to represent the Queen, Harry’s party-loving reputation preceded him, as one national newspaper warned the country’s prime minister, Tony Abbott, to ‘lock up his daughters’.

Another described the Prince as the ‘most desirable ginger in the cosmos’.

Despite a 20-hour flight from the UK, Harry showed no sign of jet lag as he boarded the Australian Navy’s survey ship HMAS Leeuwin.

The Prince was dressed in a white Army tropical uniform with the sky-blue beret of Army Air Corps.

Harry was joined on board the Leeuwin by Mr Abbott, and Governor-General Quentin Bryce, the Queen’s representative in Australia.

As Harry sailed past the Sydney Opera House, tens of thousands of spectators roared at him.

Later, he changed into a navy blue suit for a walkabout among the  adoring crowds. Among them was student Lauren Burke, 22, who resembled Harry’s girlfriend Cressida Bonas, 24.

She said: ‘I tried my best to flirt with him but it was quite formal and he was well behaved. I told him if he ever wanted to look around Sydney, I would be his guide. He smiled and laughed.’

Another onlooker, trainee medic Renee Simmons, 21, described Harry as ‘gorgeous’, adding: ‘I’m in love. He wears a uniform very well.’

The Prince then made his way across the harbour by boat to Kirribilli House, the official residence of the Australian prime minister.

He posed for photographs with Mr Abbott, his wife Margie and their daughters, Frances, 22, and Bridget, 20 – who the politician had described as ‘not bad looking’ during the recent election campaign.

Mr Abbott, a staunch monarchist, apologised to Harry for his nation’s strong republican movement, saying: ‘I regret to say that not every Australian is a monarchist, but today everyone feels like a monarchist.’

THE press had warned him to ‘lock up his daughters’ – but Mr Abbott was more than happy to introduce Prince Harry to Bridget, 20, Frances, 22, and his wife Margie at his official residence.

The fleet review climaxed with a stunning fireworks display over Sydney Harbour Bridge seen by an estimated million spectators.

He described his Sydney experience as ‘absolutely fantastic’ before boarding Mr Abbott's jet today to fly to the west coast city of Perth.

‘It's just ... really sad that we're leaving,’ the 29-year-old royal told reporters before boarding the jet. ‘Work - just can't get the time off work nowadays.’

‘The next time I come back you're going to be struggling to get rid of me, I'm sure,’ he added.

Western Australia state Premier Colin

throne explained that he had to be home in a few days.

‘He said it was a short visit because he had to be back to work on Thursday,’ Mr Barnett told reporters.

He is then heading to Dubai on Monday for a gala dinner for his charity Sentebale.

Prince Harry last visited Australia in 2003 during his gap year, when he worked on a ranch in the outback.
