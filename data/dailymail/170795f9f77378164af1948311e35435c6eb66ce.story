A haul of previously unheard songs recorded on cassette tape by a 15-year-old Gary Barlow in his bedroom have come to light.

The 100 tracks, on nine cassettes, have spent the last 20 years at the back of a fan’s music collection. Each tape has a handwritten tracklisting of the songs with unknown titles including ‘My Kind of Girl’, ‘Suddenly’ and ‘Your Power to Me.’

And four of the songs even went on to be 
used by Take That: ‘A Million Love Songs’, ‘Nobody Else’, 
‘Another Track in my Heart’ and ‘You are the One’.

Fan alert: Take That fans now have the opportunity to buy the ultimate Gary Barlow memeribilia - almost one hundred songs by teenage Gary Barlow that have never been heard before

Bidding: Auctioneers in West Sussex expect the collection of rare tapes to go for £2,000

The cassettes of five hours worth of self-written songs were recorded by Barlow in 1986, and the last tape is thought to be from 1990.

Band manager Nigel Martin-Smith first heard the collection of songs the year before and was so impressed he chose Gary to be the lead singer of the boy band he was creating.

He then went on to hold auditions for others young men to be part of the group and eventually chose Howard Donald, Jason Orange, Mark Owen and Robbie Williams.

The cassettes have been owned by a private collector for the past two decades and he has now decided to put them up for sale.

They are expected to go for £2,000 in the sale at Bellmans Auctioneers in Billingshurst, West Sussex.

Simon Garner, 38, auctioneer at Bellmans, said: 'This is clearly an unusual set of items to sell.

'In
my mind Gary Barlow is in the lime light at the moment, if he’s not 
doing charity work he is on the television and is quite a likeable 
character.

'Take That are 
huge so I think there is definitely a collector or someone out there who
would be interested in buying these cassettes.

'An awful lot of these songs, 95 out 
of the 100, haven’t been released before and when I looked up a 
selection of them I found nothing.'

Mr Garner said that there are around ten tracks on each cassette and the listing is handwritten on the back.

'Any fan who buys these would be getting a lot of songs that haven’t been heard before for their own personal use,' he said.

'The songs may not have been released for many reasons, it was at the start of his career so he could have decided they weren’t good enough or found better songs.

'He could may well have recorded them in his bedroom for all we know as he was only 15 in 1986, and we think it might be him playing the keyboard on some of the tracks.'

Auctioneers have not yet played the cassette tapes in fear that they may become jammed and break.

The tapes are offered for sale without copyright, broadcast rights, performers consents and other re-production rights, so the buyer would only be able to listen to them.

The auction is on October 11.
