Tory MPs will be ordered to back a Bill to enshrine in law David Cameron’s pledge to hold an in-out referendum on Europe.

In an unprecedented move, the Prime Minister has told his MPs they must scrap constituency meetings to vote through a Bill being launched by backbench Tory MP James Wharton.

Mr Wharton has adopted a private members’ bill that has been drawn up by Tory high command because the Lib Dems refused to allow it to be presented as a government Bill.

It promises a referendum by the end of 2017 following a renegotiation of Britain’s role in Brussels.

Orders: The Prime Minister David Cameron has told Conservative MPs they must back a Bill on an EU referendum

The vote will force Labour and the Lib Dems to decide whether they want to publicly reject a referendum – something the Tories believe will damage them at the next general election. Privately, they believe that a number of Labour MPs who also want a referendum will break ranks with their party and support the Bill.

A No 10 source said: ‘It’s difficult but it’s possible, and we’re going to give it our best shot.’

Most MPs leave Parliament on Thursdays to work in their constituencies, so votes held on Fridays are sparsely attended leaving the Bills without much chance of becoming law.

But Tory whips will impose a three-line whip on the second reading of Mr Wharton’s Bill on Friday July 5, meaning they must attend.

In a letter to all Conservative MPs last night, Foreign Secretary William Hague said: ‘The Party stands fully behind James’ Bill, and we will be deploying every mechanism available to us to ensure we have the best chance of getting this legislation through in the coming session – even in the face of opposition from the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats.

Promise: Tory MP James Wharton's private members' bill will enshrine into law a a pledge to hold an in-out referendum on Europe

‘This is an issue on which there is considerable cross-party interest, and we hope that MPs from both sides  of the House will want to support that.

‘If they do not support such a measure, then it will be clear at the next election that it is the Conservatives who are committed to giving the people a choice, with Labour and the Liberal Democrats turning their face against it.’

Leading Eurosceptic Douglas Carswell MP said: ‘It shows the party is absolutely serious about trying to get this Bill on the statute book.’

- Boris Johnson is desperate to be prime minister but would rather see David Cameron ‘fail miserably’ at the next election than stab him in the back with a leadership challenge, ex-Downing Street spin doctor Andy Coulson has said.

Writing in GQ magazine, Mr Coulson, who will soon stand trial over allegations related to phone-hacking while editor of The News Of The World, said: ‘Boris desperately wants to be prime minister. Stabbing David in the back would be distinctly off brand – just not very Boris.

‘He would much prefer to see David fail miserably in the election and ride in on his bike to save party and country.’
