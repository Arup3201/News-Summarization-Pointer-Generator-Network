New York is famous for its giant structures like the Empire State Building and One World Trade Center - and now another has been added to the list... the tallest stripper pole.

The 25ft whopper - almost as tall as two buses stacked on top of each other - is the central point of new club Vivid Cabaret, which opened over the weekend in midtown Manhattan.

At more than twice the height of other strip poles in the Big Apple, the club owners are promising more than twice the fun too - even if the steel pole does carry a three stripper capacity.

Pole dancing is a gymnastic sport originating from the Indian gymnastic tradition called mallakhab

The club, a joint venture between Rick's Cabaret, a chain of strip clubs and Vivid Entertainment, a major player in adult-film production, has already employed a long list of gorgeous girls.

Rick's Cabaret manager Steven DeAngelo said: 'When we first looked around the space we planned to have the pole in that position to make sure it was the biggest in the city.'

'It's great to have the biggest pole in New York - we love being number one.'

The New York Daily News reports that the stripper pole originates from the Indian mallakhab, a 12th century gymnastic activity that involved a vertical wooden beam.

The stripper pole at Rick's employs similar gymnastic activities of the half naked sort.

The dancer is never fully naked because New York State Law forbids nudity whilst alcohol is served but one can dream can't they?

Dancer Carlie told the New York Daily News that spectators can imagine themselves as the pole on which the dancers are writhing-though they'll probably never be that tall.
