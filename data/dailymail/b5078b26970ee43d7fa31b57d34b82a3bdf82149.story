Calling it quits: David Madden, a hiigh school principal who called a disabled student a 'psychopath,' has turned in his resignation

The principal of a small high school resigned last night after he allegedly called a student with bipolar disorder as a psychopath.

Dr David Madden, who served as principal of Oxford Area High School in Pennsylvania, allegedly made derogatory comments about several special needs students in a series of texts.

Following a public outcry, he was forced to step down from his position of authority.

The Oxford Area School District board
accepted Madden’s resignation 8-1. Following the announcement of their 
vote, members of the audience cheered, the Philadelphia 
Inquirer reported.

Parent Chrissie 
Shelly told the paper: ‘We’re sad to see a man’s career gone, but we’re 
thrilled for the children of Oxford and their futures.’

According to claims, Madden also told a Hispanic student that he was destined to be a gardener. 

But
not everyone is quite so thrilled to see the principal step down. A 
Facebook group called ‘Save Dave’ had more than 400 members. He was also
popular with many students of the school.

His last day will be June 30, the Inquirer reported.

Tension: David Madden, principal of Oxford Area High School in 
Pennsylvania, was suspended in March after several text messages
he sent went public

He was suspended in March after several text messages he sent during a meeting with the student and his mother referring to the boy as 'the biggest accident waiting to happen' and 'the inspiration for the CSI show on school killing sprees' went public.

Parents and advocates for people with disabilities have called for Madden to be fired after he was reinstated as principal earlier this month despite making remarks that the boy was 'scary' and a future John Hinckley Jr, John Wilkes Booth and Lee Harvey Oswald, according to school records.

In those messages, officials found that 
Madden had labelled the boy 'scary' and said he's a 'psychopath who has 
more rights than the kids he stalks or the teachers/administrators that 
have to deal with him.'

The incident was first reported by Lisa Lightner, a student advocate for a service provider for people with disabilities, when she sat in on the meeting between Madden, the boy and his mother.

The woman said she noticed Madden writing a text message about the boy that contained obscenities and referred to the child as 'this manipulator.'

The Arc of Chester County, the agency Ms Lightner worked for, requested a number of records from the school of other messages Madden had sent under a Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act.

Dumbest thing: Parents and advocates for people with disabilities have been calling for Madden to be fired  for six months following the insensitive outbursts

Accepted: Oxford Area School District board accepted Madden¿s resignation 8-1 after six months of controversy

Officials found that Madden made a number of remarks about the boy and special-needs students, in general, according to the records.

Madden described students with disabilities as 'the guilty people.'

'Special ed... the guilty people have more rights than the innocents. Amazing world we live in and equally amazing that people are afraid of lawsuits. I say bring them on.

'If I ever end up being a superintendent I will take it on,' he continued.

In an email, Madden wrote that although the boy only had one incident a year, it was consistent with John Hinckley Jr, John Wilkes Booth and Lee Harvey Oswald.

'Special ed... the guilty people have 
more rights than the innocents. Amazing world we live in and equally 
amazing that people are afraid of lawsuits. I say bring them on.'

He wrote: 'Same thing can be said for Hinckley, Booth and Oswald . . . they only did it once that year.'

Despite the messages, the school board initially voted 6-3 to reinstate Madden as principal. However, he had to refrain from working with students in special education.

Parents and advocates for the 
special-needs children have attended recent meetings with the school 
board requesting that the principal be fired.

Upon hearing about Madden's return, Jenny LeSage, the school's special education director, decided to quit.

She told the Philadelphia Inquirer: 'Why would you have an administrator in a building where you basically say we don't want you to have anything to do with 200 kids in the building? It's the dumbest thing I ever heard in my life.'

Oxford is a small town outside of Wilmington, Delaware, and is between Philadelphia and Baltimore.
