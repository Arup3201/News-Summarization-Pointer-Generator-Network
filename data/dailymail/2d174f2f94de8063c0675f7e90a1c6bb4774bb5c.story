Save of the tournament? Given the magnitude of the game (a World Cup quarter-final) and the timing (the 94th minute), it’s certainly a contender.

A heavy first touch took Karim Benzema wider than he would have liked, but his left-foot strike was still firm and true, the ball arrowing towards the roof of the net at Manuel Neuer’s near-post.

The ice-cool German, however, had other ideas.

Au revoir: Neuer's fine save from Benzema was France's last chance of the game as Germany held out

Sportsmail columnist Jens Lehmann analysed Neuer and Hugo Lloris before the game, and here is what he had to say...

Neuer has better, stronger arms. It can be the difference between clawing a ball off the line or it going in. The stronger your arms, the more likely you are to save powerful shots.

Flinging out his right arm, he brilliantly deflected Benzema’s shot away from goal, to preserve Germany’s narrow 1-0 lead and deflate French hopes as time ticked down to the final whistle.

Benzema could not believe it, turning away and looking to the heavens for an answer as to how Germany’s No 1 had swatted away his vicious strike so effortlessly.

France failed to conjure another chance of note, with Germany advancing to the semi-finals for the fourth World Cup in a row.
