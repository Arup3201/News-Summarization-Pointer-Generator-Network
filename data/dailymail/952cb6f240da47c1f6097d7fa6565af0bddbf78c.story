Chelsea Manning wants estrogen treatments that would help her develop breasts and other female characteristics - and she'd be willing to pay for it, her lawyer has said.

But the soldier, who was previously known as Bradley Manning but announced last week that she wishes to live as a woman, said she does not expect to live separately from male inmates in her all-male military prison and is not seeking sex-reassignment surgery.

Manning, 25, is at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas serving 35 years for leaking mountains of classified material to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks.

Her attorney David Coombs told The 
Associated Press on Monday that Manning hoped the prison 'will simply do
the right thing' over their request for hormone treatment so she won't have to sue.

New identity: Bradley Manning has announced that she wishes to be referred to as Chelsea Manning. In this undated photo provided by the U.S. Army, Manning poses for a photo wearing a wig and lipstick

Coombs said Manning decided to announce that she wanted to live as a woman the day after her sentencing because the prison said publicly it would not provide hormone treatment.

He said that he had seen people objecting to taxpayer-funded hormone therapy online and said if the Army would not pay for it, then Manning said she would.

'It's just to be comfortable in her own skin,' Coombs said.

Coombs said that the soldier had known for a long time she would make a statement about her identity, but 'she wanted, essentially, for the media surrounding the trial to dissipate'.

He added that 'people might think it was an effort to get further attention', but that Manning did not want people to think the statement was insincere.

Coombs said he and Manning knew the 
Army might not provide hormone treatment, but they were hoping the 
military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, would allow it since 
Manning had been diagnosed with gender-identity disorder by an Army 
psychiatrist who testified at his trial.

New life: Manning, pictured outside the Maryland court on Tuesday, said she has felt she is a woman since her childhood and hopes to take hormone therapy to develop breasts and other female characteristics

Support: Manning's lawyer David Coombs announced the soldier's new identity on the Today show last week

Below is the full statement Manning shared with the Today show last week:

Subject: The Next Stage of My Life

I
want to thank everybody who has supported me over the last three years.
Throughout this long ordeal, your letters of support and encouragement 
have helped keep me strong. I am forever indebted to those who wrote to 
me, made a donation to my defense fund, or came to watch a portion of 
the trial. I would especially like to thank Courage to Resist and the 
Bradley Manning Support Network for their tireless efforts in raising 
awareness for my case and providing for my legal representation.

As
I transition into this next phase of my life, I want everyone to know 
the real me. I am Chelsea Manning. I am a female. Given the way that I 
feel, and have felt since childhood, I want to begin hormone therapy as 
soon as possible. I hope that you will support me in this transition. I 
also request that, starting today, you refer to me by my new name and 
use the feminine pronoun (except in official mail to the confinement 
facility). I look forward to receiving letters from supporters and 
having the opportunity to write back.

Thank you,

Chelsea E. Manning

It
wasn't until they read a Courthouse News Service story published before
the sentencing that Manning decided to make the announcement after it 
quoted spokeswoman Kimberly Lewis saying the prison would not provide 
hormone therapy.

'It was 
Chelsea's intent to do this all along,' Coombs said. 'It was only after 
Fort Leavenworth had said that they would not provide any sort of 
medical treatment that we decided not to wait.'

Coombs also said on his blog on Monday that Manning chose Elizabeth as her middle name, replacing Edward.

He
said Manning knows there could be confusion over her name, and she 
expects to be referred to as Bradley when it has to do with events prior
to sentencing, the appeal of the court-martial and the request for a 
presidential pardon. Prison mail must be addressed to Bradley Manning.

'There's a realization that most people know her as Bradley,' Coombs said. 'Chelsea is a realist and understands.'

The 25-year-old soldier made the announcement about her new identity through Coombs last Thursday.

'As
I transition into this next phase of my life, I want everyone to know 
the real me. I am Chelsea Manning. I am a female,' Manning wrote in the 
statement first released on the Today show.

'Given
the way that I feel, and have felt since childhood, I want to begin 
hormone therapy as soon as possible. I hope that you will support me in 
this transition.'

She added that she now wishes to be referred to as Chelsea and as a 'she' rather than a 'he'.

Hours later, an Army spokesman responded to CBS News: 'The Army does not provide hormone therapy or sex-reassignment surgery for gender identity disorder.'

Troubled time: Manning was isolated and alone in the Army because of her desire to dress in female clothing

'Red flags': Defense attorneys said superiors should have recognized issues Manning was having

Military
inmates have access to mental health professionals, including a 
psychiatrist, psychologist, social workers and behavioral science 
specialists, she said.

Manning arrived at the facility after the announcement 
to begin her sentence. The prison is all-male, but spokesman George 
Marcec said soldiers can be separated from other inmates if they're a 
risk to themselves or others.

He added that Manning would not be allowed to wear a wig or bra and that her hair would have to be kept to military standard.

Manning
was demoted from private first class to private at sentencing. She will
be dishonorably discharged when the soldier finishes the prison 
sentence; the earliest she could be released on parole is 2020.

Coombs
added that the Bradley Manning Support Network, which has raised more 
than $1 million and is paying Manning's legal fees, is changing its name
to the Private Manning Support Network.

Speaking out: Manning has received support from across the world - including in Dublin, Ireland, pictured

During the 12-week trial, the Army 
released an image showing Manning wearing a 
blonde wig and makeup in a photograph she had taken herself. Manning had
sent the picture to her therapist in an email with the subject 'My 
Problem' as she struggled with her gender identity in April 2010.

'She
never really wanted this to be public,' Coombs added of Manning's 
identity and the photograph. 'Now that it is, unfortunately, you have to
deal with it in a public manner.'

Throughout
the trial, her lawyers had argued that Manning was under incredible 
stress at the time of the leaks as she struggled with gender identity 
disorder in the masculine environment of the Army.

'The
stress that he was under was mostly to give context to what was going 
on at the time,' Coombs told Savannah Guthrie on Today. 'It was never an
excuse because that's not what drove his actions. What drove his 
actions was a strong moral compass.'

A
psychiatrist, Navy Reserve Captain David Moulton, testified during 
Manning's trial that she suffered from gender dysphoria, or wanting to 
be the opposite sex, as well as narcissism and obsessive-compulsive 
disorder.

Younger years: Manning, who was apparently considering transitioning to become a woman when she returned from the warzone, has said she does not like seeing pictures of herself as a young boy

Struggle: Manning, pictured as a child, was bullied throughout school for being gay, friends have said

Defense lawyers 
had argued that Manning had been increasingly isolated and under intense
stress when she leaked the files, and that her superiors had ignored 
warning signs.

They cited erratic behavior, including sending a picture of her dressed as a woman to a superior and punching another soldier.

Manning was sentenced to 35 years in prison for leaking an unprecedented volume of classified documents to WikiLeaks.

Coombs
added that he did not expect Manning to serve her full sentence - and 
even expected President Obama to pardon the soldier.

The
first class Army private appeared not to show any emotion when her 
long-awaited fate was read out, though spectators gasped inside the 
military courtroom at Fort Meade, Maryland.

Because
of the 1,294 days she has already spent in custody, Manning will 
immediately shave three and a half years off her 35-year term.

Emotional: In this courtroom sketch made Wednesday, Manning is escorted from the courtroom as spectators gasp and cry. She will be eligible for parole after eight years

The
former intelligence analyst was found guilty last month of 20 crimes, 
including six violations of the Espionage Act, as part of the Obama 
administration's unprecedented crackdown on media leaks.

But
the judge acquitted her of the most serious charge, aiding the enemy, 
an offense that could have meant life in prison without parole.

Prosecutors portrayed Manning 
as 'the determined insider,' an anarchist hacker and traitor who started
working within weeks of his 2009 deployment to provide WikiLeaks and 
its founder Julian Assange with exactly what they wanted.

But Manning
and her defense team maintain she was an idealistic soldier with a pure 
motive - to expose brutal truths about America's military and 
diplomatic corps.

The
leaked material included video of a U.S. helicopter attack that killed 
at least two civilians -- a Reuters news photographer and his driver.

'I believed I was going to help people, not hurt people,' Manning said in a courtroom apology.
