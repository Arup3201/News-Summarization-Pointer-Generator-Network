Crime figures are likely to increase sharply following revelations about police ‘fiddling’ the data, MPs were warned yesterday.

The UK’s statistics watchdog revealed there has been no proper audit of the figures recorded by the police for an astonishing five years.

The experts predict that, when the figures are thoroughly checked, it will lead to crime once again beginning to rise.

It would be a blow to ministers who have repeatedly trumpeted that recorded crime has fallen by 10 per cent since the Coalition came to power.

Latest revelations: The UK Statistics Authority has revealed there has not been a proper audit of police crime figures for five years after withdrawing its stamp of approval on police crime figures

In the year to June last year, recorded crime was down by 5 per cent. The figures are 38 per cent lower than 2002-03.

The UK Statistics Authority (UKSA) also said they wanted to check there are no problems with other government data.

Figures on the likes of ambulance response times and NHS waiting times are also likely to come under renewed scrutiny.

Last
 week the Mail told how, in an extraordinary move, the UKSA had stripped
 the police’s recorded crime figures of their ‘gold standards’ status.

The watchdog said there was increasing evidence that the data was ‘unreliable’.

A string of serving and ex-senior police officers have admitted to concerns that forces have been ‘fiddling’ the figures.

Warning: MPs have been told that crime statistics are likely to rise after a proper audit has been conducted of police figures

Yesterday,
 UKSA head Sir Andrew Dilnot expressed regret the watchdog had not 
highlighted major problems with the information earlier.

He
 told Westminster’s Public Administration Committee: ‘It is quite 
conceivable, indeed I think quite likely, that if there is proper 
auditing introduced, the recording of crime is improved, that we will 
see recorded crime increase.’

Sir
 Andrew said there had been inadequate auditing since 2007-8, and 
statisticians had been voicing concerns for years. John Flatley, head of
 crime statistics at the Office for National Statistics, said some 
police appeared to be ‘confused’ about whether offences should be 
recorded if there was not enough evidence to bring a charge.

Crime prevention minister Norman Baker has admitted there is a 'dent' in public confidence in police data

In
 his own evidence to MPs, crime prevention minister  Norman Baker 
accepted that there was a ‘dent’ in public confidence in the police 
data. But he insisted: ‘I don’t accept that the Home Office has any 
interest in manipulating figures. We have no interest in having figures 
that do not tell us the truth.’

He
 added: ‘I still hold to the view that there is not an endemic problem 
in the sense that there is a deliberate attempt across forces to massage
 figures’.

But Labour MP 
Paul Flynn insisted ministers should be more ‘repentant’ about the 
‘mathematical gymnastics’ that had been taking place, claiming there had
 been ‘a remarkable capacity for self-delusion’.

The next set of quarterly crime statistics is due tomorrow.

Committee
 chairman Bernard Jenkin accused the Home Office of ‘complacency’. And 
he warned London mayor Boris Johnson and 13 crime commissioners who have
 set their forces local targets to reduce their recorded crime figures 
to make sure this does not lead them to chase targets rather than to cut
 crime.

In previous 
evidence to MPs, police told how politically sensitive crimes had been 
reclassified. For example, a burglary might be called criminal damage to
 downplay its significance.

Some
 offences are recorded as ‘no crime’. A victim may not be able to prove 
their mobile phone was stolen so it is logged as ‘lost’.
