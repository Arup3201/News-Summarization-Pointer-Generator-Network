A team of black-clad marksmen march across the airport tarmac, while a sea of police outriders rumble through downtown Los Angeles.

Is America mobilising for a major emergency? No, Barack Obama’s due on a chat show.

The President mustered a massive security operation for a few minutes’ joking around with host Jimmy Kimmel.

Television appearance: Barack Obama appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Thursday - but had to muster a massive security troop to keep him safe while he was in Los Angeles

Cavalcade: The President heads for the television studio, to take part in the light-hearted interview

The US president could have opted for the simpler – and cheaper – option of a live satellite link-up from the White House to appear on the late-night show.

Instead he chose to fly to LA in Air Force One to appear on Jimmy Kimmel Live – even enlisting aerial support from a futuristic-looking military aircraft on the way.

Once in the studio, Mr Obama didn’t even have much to say beyond reading out cruel Twitter jibes and making jokes about how much time he spends on the golf course. 

However, his appearance on Thursday’s episode of the show was criticised by those who were faced with traffic disruption in the notoriously congested Californian city. 

Although the President made part of his journey by helicopter in response to previous gripes, locals still vented their fury on Twitter.

However, using a chopper did at least allow Angelinos a glimpse of the latest – and most expensive – toys in the presidential entourage. 

Criticism: Some have suggested it would have been cheaper for him to appear via Skype on the show

Formidable: A vast line of outriders follows the President as he heads to the television studios

Guard: These three US Military V-22 Osprey, worth $68million each, were seen flying next to Marine One

Three £45million Osprey MV-22s shadowed the President as he boarded his helicopter, Marine One, at LAX for the quick hop to Burbank Airport.

The fully-armed ‘tilt-rotor’ aircraft, stationed at a nearby US Marines base, is a cross between a plane and a helicopter and capable of vertical take-off. 

On arrival, a vast motorcade of 40 vehicles then accompanied Mr Obama to the studio in Hollywood.

Meanwhile, wife Michelle recorded an appearance for a different TV show. The First Lady will plug her health initiatives on the Ellen DeGeneres Show, to be screened on Monday.
