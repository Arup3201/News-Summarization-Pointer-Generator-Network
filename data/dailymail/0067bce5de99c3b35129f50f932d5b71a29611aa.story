An Iranian conman allegedly duped ten wannabe models into being his sex slaves after pretending to be an oil tycoon with an enviable list of contacts in the fashion industry.

The 50-year-old, known as Shoja S, reportedly fathered seven children with the women after convincing them all to live at his Spanish palace for three years with the promise of making them catwalk stars.

The European and Asian girls, aged between 19 and 24, soon realised they were being conned, but were unable to leave after allegedly being subjected to emotional and physical abuse.

'They were always controlled and supervised by him,' it was reported by Spanish newspaper ABC, according to The Local.

'He threatened to harm them if they didn't tell him everything they were doing.'

One of the women has now filed a lawsuit against Shoja S for allegedly forcing her family to pay the €6,500 (£5,300) rent for his mansion in Marbella where they were housed.

Eight others have pressed charges against him for physical and psychological abuse that allegedly left them in a state of 'terror'.

Shoja S, who pretended to be a CEO for an oil company, told a court in Marbella that the girls were his employees.

The woman - originally from Germany, Lithuania, Kazakhstan, Denmark, Mongolia, Russia and Turkmenistan - have left the house.

Some are living in shelters, while one has left the country.
