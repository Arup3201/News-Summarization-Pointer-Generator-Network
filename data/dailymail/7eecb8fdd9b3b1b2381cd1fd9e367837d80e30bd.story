They are two of sport's most famous faces and it seems that golfer Rory McIlroy and his tennis player girlfriend Caroline Wozniacki couldn't be more in love.

The athletic couple, who have been dubbed 'Wozzilroy', were spotted sharing a tender kiss after his first round of the Masters golf tournament yesterday in Augusta.

Caroline looked every inch the golfing WAG in a stylish cream and navy knit dress, complete with Panama style hat and quilted navy Chanel handbag.

Adding a touch of sport chic to her outfit, 5ft 10in Caroline donned a pair of pale blue and white trainers.

The Danish-born blonde was in good spirits despite her beau's disappointing day on the course and it seems that Rory wanted to reward her for her support with a cheeky smooch.

Dedicated Caroline was even spotted acting as a caddie for her world number two boyfriend for the traditional par-three competition on the eve of the US Masters on Wednesday.

Rory, 23, got Caroline 
carrying his clubs and even let her hit his tee shot on the ninth hole.

'I really wanted her to come and see what it is all about,' he said.

While she may currently be Rory's biggest cheerleader, Caroline has an impressive sporting CV of her own.

At just 22, she is a former World No. 1 on the WTA Tour. As of 23 January 2012, she held this position for 67 weeks and was the first Scandinavian woman to hold the top ranking position.

While the couple haven't been able to keep their hands off each other over this week's Masters tournament, their relationship hasn't always been plain sailing.

Rory was actually dating long-term girlfriend Holly Sweeney for six years 
when he met Wozniacki at a boxing match in Germany last July.
