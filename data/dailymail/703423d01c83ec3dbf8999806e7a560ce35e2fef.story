Cristiano Ronaldo is reportedly set to become the subject of a four-year degree at a university in Canada.

The University of British Columbia Okanagan is to start up a sociology degree focusing on the cultural importance of Ronaldo’s fame and its effects on the society.

Even though the course won't be based around his step overs or his powerful free kicks, Professor Luis Aguiar says the Real Madrid star will be heavily talked about.

Speaking in a recent interview he said: 'Ronaldo is the centre and every discussion, class meeting revolves around Ronaldo initially. And then we explore, we broaden out to larger themes. 

'So it starts with Ronaldo but Ronaldo is almost like a springboard to talk about larger issues that are much more sociologically significant than just a biography of Ronaldo.' 

Aguiar also admitted that he wasn't sure if the Portuguese star knew about the course but offered him an open invitation to talk to future classes.  

'I don't know if Ronaldo knows about the course.

'I haven't heard from Ronaldo, I haven't heard from his entourage,' he adds. 'I would love to hear from either one, and I would love to have Ronaldo maybe Skyping into the class.'
