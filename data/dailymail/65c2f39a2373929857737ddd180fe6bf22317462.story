A yoga ashram that initially offered a 'healing' fire ceremony to cleanse people who had been drugged, raped and beaten as children at the retreat say they will now offer compensation to victims years after they were sexually abused.

Disturbing details have emerged at a royal commission into the sexual abuse of children in the 1970s and 1980s at the Mangrove Yoga Ashram on the NSW Central Coast.

The commission has heard from nine abuse victims who have told how the former spiritual leader at the isolated retreat in the foothills of Mangrove Mountain, Swami Akhandananda, used them for his sexual gratification. 

Disturbing details have emerged at a royal commission into the sexual abuse of children in the 1970s and 1980s at the Mangrove Yoga Ashram on the NSW Central Coast 

One victim revealed last week that she was held down naked at seven years of age and had the skin between her breasts cut during an initiation ceremony, before a swami licked the blood and had sex with her. 

Child victims have also given evidence of the second in charge, known as Shishy, allegedly subjecting them to fierce beatings and summoning teenage girls for sex with Akhandananda.

Shishy admitted to slapping the children at the royal commission, but couldn't recall some of the more vicious assaults described by the victims. 

Akhandananda came to Australia from his native India in the mid-1970s to start the ashram as a disciple of the well-established Satyananda Yoga movement.

Shishi told the commission last week that, even though sex was banned by the movement's head, Swami Satyananda Saraswati, she began a sexual relationship with Akhandananda in secret when she was a teenager. 

She said she was also expected to have sex with Satyananda when he was visiting Australia

Sarah Tetlow, chief executive of the Satyananda Yoga Academy, said on Wednesday she had no idea until now 'of the depth of the impact that this (the abuse) has had on people' and agreed the initial response should have been different.

The ashram's response to those who came forward to tell of sexual, emotional and physical abuse by Akhandananda and his 'handmaiden' Shishy has come under fire during seven days of evidence at the public hearing in Sydney. 

Mangrove Yoga Ashram posted a generic apology on Facebook, then blocked abuse survivors from posting responses and sent letters threatening legal action to others.

It then invited all victims to a havan - a ritual fire ceremony to help them heal as part of the ashram's 40th anniversary celebrations. 

In reply to Peter O'Brien, solicitor for six of the victims, Ms Tetlow said she appreciated why his clients would be extremely sceptical of an organisation whose response was to have a fire ceremony to deal with their trauma. 

'We were trying to do things that were helpful,' she said, adding she realised they had not done the right thing and welcomed the commission's inquiry.

Mr O'Brien has since sent the Mangrove Yoga Ashram lawyers an assessment of damages, seeking $1 million compensation for each of his clients. 

The amount has yet to be worked out and Ms Tetlow said they expected compensation would be part of any redress.

The academy's assets exceed its liabilities by $5.6 million.

It has two ashrams, Mangrove Mountain, and one in rural Victoria, as well as a school at Manly and three other properties held in two trusts.

In October, the Australian academy received an email from head office in India upbraiding it for not taking responsibility for the abuse and tarnishing the name of the current leader - Swami Niranjan Saraswati.

The Bihar School of Yoga, the international centre of the Satyananda movement, threatened to withdraw all support to its Australian branch and demanded an apology.

A lawyer representing the India-based school told the commission on Wednesday that until the hearing his client did not know the appalling extent of the abuse.

One yoga devotee told the royal commission on Tuesday they didn't think the ashram should be held responsible for abuse inflicted on children by its former spiritual leader and his second-in-command - Akhandananda and Shishi.

Muktimurti, a longtime resident of the Mangrove Yoga Ashram said she did not really believe the allegations against  Akhandananda when he was brought to trial.

She said in her statement to the commission she found it 'morally questionable' for victims to now seek financial compensation.

'I don't agree with the ashram being held to ransom for something that none of us in the ashram community have anything to do with,' she said.

Muktimurti said she believed compensation would imply the ashram had done something wrong.

Akhandananda, who has since died, was jailed in 1989 for abusing four girls but the conviction was overturned on a technicality in 1991. He died in 1997 . 

Muktimurti, who lived at the ashram from 1978 to 1996 and is back there in an administrative position, was Shishy's assistant and denies she ever brought girls to Akhandananda's bedroom for sex on Shishy's instructions.

'All I know is that my experience, my own experience of living in the ashram has had nothing to do with anything like that,' she said.

Tearfully, she said she found the hearing distressing because if the acts were true, it was dreadful and if they weren't, those making the allegations were being 'venal'.

Earlier, the commission heard from a doctor who was a resident at Mangrove in the 1980s.

Henry Sztulman said he never saw any 'overt behaviour' indicating abuse of the children and denied allegations he prescribed morphine regularly for minor ailments such as an infected toe.

The hearing continues.
