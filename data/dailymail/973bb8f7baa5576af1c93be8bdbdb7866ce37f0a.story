Two students arrested for breaking into a home in Florida tried to get themselves off the hook by saying they were only there to have sex.

Allison Riddle and Evan Jones, both 18, allegedly sneaked into a house in Bradenton, Florida, on Saturday night and were found in the owner's bedroom by a deputy sheriff.

But after they were led out at gunpoint and sat down, the two tried to explain themselves, saying they 'were not there to steal anything'.

In a police report cited by The Smoking Gun, the officer describes how he announced himself when he came into house but at first received no response.

When he reached the bedroom door he repeated himself, and Jones responded by saying: 'Alright, we are coming out'.

The officer explained that he had entered by an unlocked door, but Jones later said he had been given a code to get in through the garage by a friend who mowed the owner's lawn.

It is thought that the authorities were tipped off to the alleged break-in by a neighbour who saw the pair entering.

The owner, who lives in Michigan, was not there at the time and had to be told by phone.

Jones was bailed on Sunday for $7,500, while Riddle has been left in custody.
