Australian airlines will be required to have two crew in the cockpit of their planes at all times after the Germanwings tragedy that killed 150 passengers and crew. 

Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said the rules will apply to any regular aircraft carrying 50 passengers or more and will 'take effect immediately'. 

French prosecutors allege Andreas Lubitz, the co-pilot of downed flight 4U9525, plunged his plane into an Alpine ravine on March 24 after locking his captain out of the cockpit.  

Qantas has announced that it is discussions with regulators over it's cockpit policies 

''Today's decision is a sensible, measured response that combines safeguarding the travelling public with the practical capabilities of the aviation sector,' Mr Truss said in a statement. 

A spokesman for Qantas, the nation's biggest airline, said the new arrangement would apply to Qantas, QantasLink, Network Aviation and Jetstar flights.  

'When one pilot needs to leave the cockpit for any reason, another authorised person will occupy the jump seat,' the spokesman said. 

The spokesman said the airline has 'numerous layers of screening and support for pilots'. 

That includes medical checks, stress management training, confidential counselling and psychometric testing during recruitment. 

In the UK, a few airlines have announced the new move will come into force tomorrow and aviation insiders say there are moves to make it 'mandatory' across all airlines

Qantas have said that they are still considering whether or not their policies need to be tightened 

In a statement released to Daily Mail Australia last week, Virgin Australia said their pilots also undergo medical exams. 

The airline said they are constantly in contact with regulatory bodies and have comprehensive measures in place on all flights to ensure the safety of guests and crew.

However they said that those details were to remain confidential for security purposes

'The Virgin Australia Group continuously undertakes detailed risk reviews, including consultation with the relevant regulatory and industry bodies. Any updates regarding changes to our processes will be provided where appropriate,' a Virgin spokesperson said. 

'All Virgin Australia Group Pilots undertake regular aeromedical exams, which include mental health assessments.'   

Airlines and aviation regulators around the world last week began taking steps to ensure there are always two people in the cockpit.

Tragedy: It emerged today that Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz (pictured) locked the plane's pilot out of the cockpit and 'deliberately' crashed the plane into the French Alps, killing 150 people on board

In the UK, EasyJet and Virgin Atlantic announced plans to change their aviation policy on staff numbers in the cockpit.

Monarch and Thomas Cook also confirmed they had changed their policies, while Ryanair, Jet2 and Flybe said they already required two crew members to be in the cockpit at all times.

Elsewhere around Europe, the continent's third-largest budget carrier, Norwegian Air Shuttle, said it would require two people in the cockpit at all times for safety reasons.

A Civil Aviation Authority spokesman said: 'Following the details that have emerged regarding the tragic Germanwings incident, we are co-ordinating closely with colleagues at the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and have contacted all UK operators to require them to review all relevant procedures.

Horror: After voice recordings emerged from the doomed A320 revealing how the pilot tried to kick down the cockpit door, EasyJet said a cabin crew member will enter the cockpit if the pilot or co-pilot needs the toilet

'All UK airline pilots undergo extensive and regular medical assessments to determine their fitness to hold a licence.

As part of this, aeromedical examiners are required to assess a commercial pilot's mental health at each medical examination which, for an airline pilot flying with at least one other pilot, is undertaken annually.

'These detailed medical assessments are in line with international aviation standards.

'We will continue to monitor the situation as the investigation develops and our thoughts remain with the friends and relatives of all those affected by this tragic incident.'

'Deliberate': Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin said Lubitz used the flight managing system to put the plane into a descent, something that can only be done manually

Heart-broken: Family of the victims of the crash gathered near the scene in Le Vernet near the French Alps today, as rescuers tried to recover the dead bodies of their deceased relatives

Rescue: Helicopters lowered investigators down to the scene of the obliterated plane where debris and human remains were scattered

Raid: German police have investigated Andreas Lubitz's €500,000 family home in Montabaur in Germany as well as his apartment in Dusseldorf

Killer's home: A French prosecutor in Marseille said Mr Lubitz's breathing was normal as the plane descended rapidly before crashing into the French Alps
