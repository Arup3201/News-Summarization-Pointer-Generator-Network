Heat-seeking cameras and night vision goggles are common place among police forces, fire services and security firms but, until now, were out of the reach of everyday consumers.

Proving a smartphone camera can be used just about anything, a team of thermal imaging experts has created an iPhone case fitted with a tiny heat-seeking device.

Called FLIR One, the case and camera can be used to find visible, and hidden, heat sources and, coupled with an additional visible camera, even lets users see in total darkness.

The FLIR One case, pictured left and right, is fitted with a small thermal imaging camera. It can be used see in total darkness, through smoke, view wildlife,  and find invisible heat and damp spots. This could help homeowners identify where drafts are coming from, or find mould and wet spots before they appear

Launch date: Expected in Spring

Price:  $350 (around £212)

Scene range temperature: 0°C to 100°C

Weight: 3.2 ounces (90grams)

Dimensions: 5.5 inches x 2.4 inches x 85 inches

Battery capacity: 1400 mA/h 

Sensitivity: Temperature differences as small as 0.1°C

This can help homeowners identify where drafts are coming from, or find mould and wet spots before they appear, for example.

Additionally,
 it could be used to identify heat loss around windows and doors and 
spot overloaded electrical connections and circuits.

The case was created by Oregon-based FLIR Systems.

Users fit their phone into the device, download the FLIR One app and then point the camera at everyday objects. 

The camera uses what's called 'multi-spectral dynamic imaging' to create high-quality thermal pictures in real-time. These images can be seen on the iPhone's screen, pictured

The camera can detect minimal changes in temperature of just 0.1°C to show which areas of an object are hotter, or cooler, than others. As seen in the face and body of this cat. As well as showing heat spots, the camera can be used at night to see in total darkness and see through smoke

The case also comes with a visible camera and is charged by USB. It is expected to cost around $350 (£212) when it goes on sale in the Spring

The camera uses what’s called ‘multi-spectral dynamic imaging’ to  create high-quality thermal pictures in real-time.

These images can be seen on the iPhone’s 
screen and the app can also give temperature readings of the objects in
 the pictures. 

It can even detect minimal changes in temperature of just 0.1°C to show which areas of an object are hotter, or cooler, than others.

As well as showing heat spots, the camera can be used at night to see in total darkness and see through smoke and mist.

It will additionally find invisible heat sources and cool spots that are naked to the human eye.

Elsewhere, wildlife enthusiasts can use the camera to track animals in daylight, and at night.

The case is fitted with its own battery and will last for up to two hours continuous use on a single charge.

However, the technology still comes at a price - the case is expected to cost around $350 (£212) when it goes on sale in the Spring. 

The first model was created for iPhone 5 and 5S models but an Android version is expected later this year.
