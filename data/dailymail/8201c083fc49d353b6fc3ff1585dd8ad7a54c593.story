Scientists believe there are around one million near-Earth asteroids that could pose a threat to our planet – but only a tiny fraction have so far been detected.

The threat is so serious that former astronaut Ed Lu has described it as ‘cosmic roulette’ and said that only ‘blind luck’ has so far saved humanity from a serious impact.

Now the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space has created a special action team to deal with the problem.

Dubbed the International Analysis and Warning Network (IAWN), the team will gather and analyse information on asteroids to warn governments of a potential threat.

According to Leonard David writing for Space.com, a number of groups already exist to monitor the asteroid threat, but the IAWN hopes to combine their expertise.

Another group, called the Space Mission Planning Advisory Group (SMPAG), is also hoping to promote international collaboration to deflect threatening asteroids.

For the first time, SMPAG (pronounced ‘same page’) is allowing national space agencies from North and South America, Europe, Asia and Africa to coordinate their reaction to asteroid threats

Dramatic proof that any of these can strike Earth came on 15 February last year, when an unknown object exploded high above Chelyabinsk, Russia, with 20–30 times the energy of the Hiroshima atomic bomb.

There have been a number of technological – and bizarre - solutions to deal with the threat.

For instance, earlier this year US researchers revealed an audacious plan to blow up asteroid approaching Earth with nuclear weapons.

The Iowa team outlined their vision at a Nasa conference, and say they would need just a weeks’ notice to launch if the system were developed.

Called the Hypervelocity Asteroid Intercept Vehicle, or HAIV, the craft would rendezvous with an asteroid in deep space.

It consists of a leader spacecraft, which would hit the comet and create blast crater.

Around a millisecond later, a follower spacecraft carrying nuclear explosives would hit inside the crater - which increases its effectiveness by up to 20 times.

The resulting shock wave caused widespread damage and injuries, making it the largest known natural object to have entered the atmosphere since the 1908 Tunguska event, which destroyed a forest area of Siberia.

Its not just the world's space agencies that are pooling their talents. Nasa has turned to the public to find asteroid hunters that could help save the planet.

Nasa is offering up to $35,000 (£21,000) to anyone who is able develop computer code that can identify life-threatening asteroids.

The bounty is part of its Asteroid Data Hunter contest which plans to reduce the number of false positives found in images from ground-based telescopes.

Over the past two decades, Nasa has been looking for dangerous near-Earth asteroids larger than 1km in size, and claims to have found 98 per cent of them.

But existing asteroid detection systems can only track one per cent of the estimated objects that orbit the sun, according to asteroid mining firm Planetary Resources, who is partnering with Nasa on the project.

In a session at the SXSW conference in Texas earlier this, Nasa scientist Jason Kessler said: ‘The likelihood of something hitting us in the future is pretty guaranteed, although we’re not freaking out that there is an imminent threat.’

The threat is so serious that former astronaut Ed Lu (right) has described it as ‘cosmic roulette’ and said that only ‘blind luck’ has so far saved humanity from a serious impact. Here he is pictured with Yuri Malenchenko
