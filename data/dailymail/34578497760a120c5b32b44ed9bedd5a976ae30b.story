A new generation of skin creams hailed as the ‘holy grail’ of anti-ageing has received more than 5,000 pre-orders in the UK alone - a week before they even go on sale.

The Yves Saint Laurent Forever Young Liberator cream uses science to ‘trick’ the skin into regenerating by artificially boosting levels of glycans, complex sugars that play a crucial role in the structure of healthy skin.

Experts in ‘glycomics’ or glycobiology - the study of glycans - say they are vital to maintaining the body’s systems but decline in old age, with the skin particularly effected.

The study of the sugars was dubbed ‘one of the ten emerging technologies that would change the world’ by journal Technology Review MIT in 2003, and it has already led to the development of the Hib B vaccine against fatal infant flu.

But it is also vital for the skin, YSL parent company L’Oreal says.

Researchers have found that by synthesising glycans and boosting the levels of three types of the sugar can give the skin greater thickness and elasticity.

A L’Oreal spokeswoman said: 'At our research department the race is on to work out the glycome - all the glycans - of skin because glycans are the key to skin health and regeneration.'

To develop the new Forever Young Liberator range, L’Oreal enlisted the help of chemist Professor Peter Seeberger, of the Max Planck Institute.

In two years of research he found that glycans have a role to play in almost every aspect of what skin looks like and also discovered the number of glycans in our skin diminishes with age, meaning cells no longer receive the messages they need to maintain youthful-looking skin. 

The team realised that by artificially raise the levels of glycans in older skin, you could trick it into behaving like younger skin. 

The glycan combination, known as Glycantif, has been patented and the firm says it is the first time glycobiology has been applied to skincare.

In self tests on 50 women, 88 per cent said their skin looked more luminous while 72 per cent said fine lines appeared less visible.

L’Oreal says that more than 5000 UK women have already registered to order the cream, which goes on sale next week.

Amandine Ohayon, general manager of Yves Saint Laurent, said: 'This is one of the most amazing scientific breakthroughs we have discovered in relation to anti-aging. 

'The products are set to be the holy grail of anti-aging for many women given their proven efficacy. 

'Glycobiology is opening up a whole new area of possibilities when it comes to skincare.  “We’re just at the very start of it and are already excited.'
