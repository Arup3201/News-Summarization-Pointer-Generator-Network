This is the dramatic moment a man dived in to save two British female doctors who died trying to rescue their children swept out to sea off the coast of Spanish holiday island Tenerife.

Barathi Ravikumar, 40, and Uma Ramalingam, 42, were on holiday together with their families but got into difficulty after they were swept off rocks at Playa Paraiso.

It is believed two children and another
 woman from the group were dragged out first by the strong current before their mothers 
jumped in to rescue them.

Dr Ramalingam’s husband, Palanichamy 
Chandra, a 49-year-old consultant gastroenterologist, dived in also but only managed to save their ten-year-old son Hari.

Others nearby also managed to pull another child out before the emergency services arrived with a boat and a helicopter.

The spot is beautiful but deadly according to locals as it appears calm but strong waves can arrive suddenly, crashing into the rocks. 

According to local press a person died 
in similar circumstances 10 years ago and locals are asking the 
authorities to put up warning signs in the area.

The children, a 10-year-old and a 
14-year-old, along with the other woman, are now recovering but the two 
mothers were declared dead at the scene.

Maria Bragalenti, a local who witnessed the tragedy, said: 'It was desperate and so sad.'

Paramgsi
 Kumar, 45, a friend of Mr Chandra, said: ‘I spoke to him and he is 
completely heartbroken to have lost her. He told me, “I saw it all 
happen. I went in after them but I couldn’t save her”.

Tragic: Dr Uma Ramalingam a consultant obstetrician from Altrincham in Cheshire - was pronounced dead at the scene after getting into difficulty at the Playa Paraiso resort

Scene: The group of five were washed out to sea after a large wave knocked them from a rock on this beach in Tenerife at about 6pm yesterday

‘He managed to save his son but couldn’t get to his wife in time. He is devastated.’

Hari,
 who attends Manchester Grammar School, was taken to hospital with 
hypothermia while the 14-year-old was treated at the scene for cuts and 
bruising.

A third woman, who was part of their group, was saved by hotel workers and fishermen in Sunday evening’s tragedy.

Victim: Dr Ramalingam (pictured) registered as a specialist in obstetrics and gynaecology in November 2009, according to the General Medical Council

Rocky: The group got into difficulties off the resort of Playa Paraiso in the south west of the island

Adam
 Cramer, a 49-year-old British father of three, rescued the girl. ‘She 
told me I had saved her life,’ he said last night.

‘As I got her out on 
to the rocks I could see that they had pulled a body from the water.

‘What
 they had been doing was standing on the rocks looking at the waves 
crashing in.

'Unfortunately one of those waves was so big it crashed in 
and swept them out to sea.

'The girl I rescued wasn’t even in swimwear, 
she was in shorts and a T-shirt.’

Dr Ramalingam lived in an £800,000 
house in upmarket Bowdon in Greater Manchester and worked at the Royal 
Oldham Hospital women and children’s unit.

Rescue: Tourists, hotel workers and local fishermen dived into the water and were able to save the lives of both children and one of the women

Neighbour Colin Skelton, 
79, said: ‘It’s a terrible shock. They are a lovely family and she was a
 great mother doting on her son.

‘She was very hard-working and was coming and going at all hours. Her son Hari is very bright and bubbly.’

The
 Indian-born obstetrician suffered tragedy seven years ago when her 
first husband, Dr Kannan Palaniswamy, was killed in a car crash near the
 Dundee hospital they both worked at.

Dr Ramalingam’s close friend and former neighbour Graham Meade, 62, said: ‘She was quite simply a lovely woman.

‘Her
 parents and brother, who is also a doctor, would visit from India and 
we all knew each other because our street was a new-build development 
and everyone was very close.

Location: All of those involved in the tragedy are believed to have been staying at Playa Paraiso in south west Tenerife. The resort is about five miles west of the popular Playa de las Americas complex

'She suffered tragedy in losing her first husband and for this to happen is just unbelievable.

‘My thoughts are with her son and her immediate family.

‘She moved away from Dundee to work in Cheshire as a fresh start and for this to happen now is just heart-breaking.’

Dr
 Ravikumar’s husband Chinnusamy is a consultant in diabetes and 
endocrinology for the United Lincolnshire Hospitals trust. The couple 
were based in the small village of Reepham five miles north of Lincoln.

A
 family friend issued a statement saying the GP was the loving mother of
 two young girls.

‘We are devastated by this shocking news,’ it said. 
‘Barathi will be sorely missed by her family, friends, colleagues and 
patients.’

The deaths were being investigated by local police and the Guardia Civil.

Effort: A spokesman for the local emergency services said a rescue helicopter had been mobilised along with two ambulances, coastguards and firefighters had been called to the beach

Dr Ramalingam was a consultant obstetrician who worked across several hospitals in the Pennine Acute Hospital Trust catchment area - including Royal Oldham Hospital (pictured) and North Manchester General
