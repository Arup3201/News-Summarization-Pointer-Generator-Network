Chelsea target Filipe Luis has moved a step closer to leaving Atletico Madrid after the Spanish champions signed Granada full-back Guilherme Siqueira.

The arrival of £8million Siqueira - who spent last season on loan at Benfica - on a four-year deal opens the door to the likely departure of left back Luis, who has been strongly linked to a move to Chelsea.

New direction: Guilherme Siqueira has signed for Atletico from Granada having spent last season on loan at Benfica

‘Siqueira will increase the competitiveness of the group,’ sports director Jose Luis Perez Caminero told the Atletico website on Friday.

‘He is a player that is very strong at set-plays, taking penalties, he has a lot of attacking qualities as well as great defensive ability.’

Atletico's defence conceded just 26 goals in 38 La Liga games as they won the title for the first time since 1996 and Luis - who the Blues have identified as a potential replacement for Ashley Cole - was an integral part of that feat.
