Chinese presidents are not usually known for popping into restaurants and picking up some lunch so when Xi Jinping decided to grab a bite to eat it caused a media storm.

The leader wandered into the Qing Feng Bun Shop and ordered steamed buns, pig innard soup, and stir-fried vegetables.

When it came to paying the £2 bill, the president paid it himself before sitting down at a small table to enjoy his meal.

Xi's visit to the western Beijing restaurant was quickly captured on smartphones and pictures soon started circulating on Sina Weibo, China's version of Twitter.

His casual visit is a stark contrast to the way the Communist Party usually presents itself, Foreign Policy reports.

The government is known for stage-managed appearances and state-controlled media usually accompany any visits or official business.

But on this trip, the president didn't have any media with him and he was accompanied by two men. 

Today, Xi Jinping did have a more presidential air as he gave the New Year's Eve address on state television

He sat eating his soup as other diners took pictures and asked to be pictured with him.

The president seemed to happily pose for pictures and the grainy pictures show him taking his own tray of food and paying for it as the crowds of people watch.

He follows in the footsteps of US President Barack Obama who has posed for pictures with Prime Minister David Cameron grilling burgers in the back garden at Downing Street.

Today, Xi Jinping did have a more presidential air as he gave the annual New Year's Eve address on state television.
