Former Labour minister Denis Macshane, who was jailed for fiddling his expenses, has welcomed news that thousands of pieces of paperwork relating to the MPs expenses scandal have been shredded.

The ex-MP, who served six weeks of a six-month sentence for fraudulently claiming £13,000, said he was 'so glad' that records of claims made before 2010 had been destroyed so that other politicians 'won't face difficulties'. 

The disposal of the documents led to accusations the Parliamentary authorities, and the Speaker, John Bercow, are trying to avoid any further scrutiny of the claims.

Former Labour minister Denis MacShane was jailed two days before Christmas after pleading guilty to false accounting by filing 19 fake receipts for 'research and translation' services

Today he wrote on Twitter how he was pleased that all records of expense claims from before 2010 had been destroyed to prevent other politicians facing 'difficulties'

Documents are routinely being destroyed after three years, under arcane rules known as the Authorised Records Disposal Practice.

Details of the practice emerged after members of the public wrote to the standards watchdog, Kathryn Hudson, to raise concerns about their MP's claims only to be told there can be no investigation due to lack of evidence.

Writing on Twitter today, Mr MacShane said: So all records of MPs exes prior to 2010 have been destroyed. Bit late for me but so glad for others that they won't face difficulties.'

MacShane, 65, pleaded guilty to false accounting by filing 19 fake receipts for 'research and translation' services and was jailed two days before Christmas 2013. 

A House of Commons spokesman told the Daily Telegraph last night that the rules were designed to comply with the Data Protection Act – a law which protects individuals' private information.

The comments will raise concerns that privacy of MPs is being used as an excuse to delete potentially damaging information - and remove the chance of future investigations.

Under the same set of guidelines, the pay, discipline and sickness records of Commons staff are kept until their 100th birthday and thousands of other classes of official documents on the day-to-day running of the House are stored indefinitely in the Parliamentary Archive.

A disk electronic containing copies of scanned receipts, expenses forms and correspondence which were reported on by the Daily Telegraph in 2009 remains with the paper.

It is now thought to be the last remaining record.

Expenses documents were leaked following a High Court case battle by the Commons authorities to prevent the release of the information.

Details of the deletions prompted the suggestion last night that police could no longer launch 'cold case' investigations like that which undermined Maria Miller (pictured)

Details of the deletions prompted the suggestion last night that police could no longer launch 'cold case' investigations like that which undermined Maria Miller.

The former Culture Secretary resigned in April and apologised to the Commons after Mrs Hudson ruled she had wrongly claimed thousands of pounds in mortgage payments between 2005 and 2009 on a home occupied by her parents. The case was first uncovered by the Telegraph in 2012.

Details of the deletions came after Tory activists the watchdog to investigate accommodation claims worth £103,000 made by Isle of Wight MP Andrew Turner, between 2004 and 2010.

They alleged he improperly designated the five-bedroom island home he shares with his partner as his 'second home' while telling the fees office that a one-bedroom flat in London was his main home.

The MP insisted his claims were audited and found in compliance with the rules at the time.

Mrs Hudson, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards said the allegation was 'serious', but refused to investigate, citing 'availability of evidence'.

She added: 'All records relating to expenses claims before 2010 have now been destroyed.

'No unredacted information is now available here nor any notes of conversations or advice given to Mr Turner which might establish the facts,' she wrote.

A House of Commons spokesman said the policy on destroying MPs' expenses records was 'long-standing', but it was originally set by the Members Estimate Committee, which is now chaired by Mr Bercow.

John Mann (left), the Labour MP for Bassetlaw, said members have been kept in the dark about the policy, while Sir Alistair Graham (right) said historians have been denied the chance to study Parliament's 'worst hour'

In the immediate aftermath of the scandal, in March 2010, the committee called for the policy to be suspended and all expenses records to be saved.

But two years later, it began deleting again, after an agreement between the three main parties.

Only expenses records where inquiries into wrongdoing have already been opened have been retained.

John Mann, the Labour MP for Bassetlaw, said members have been kept in the dark about the policy.

'It sounds like MPs trying to protect MPs again. It will make the public very suspicious of what the motive is. The old gentlemen's club is resurrecting itself.'

Sir Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said historians have been denied the chance to study Parliament's 'worst hour'.

'There was a strong public interest in retaining this information so that people have access to it, and I'm really very surprised.'

Mr Turner said his expenses were independently audited twice in 2009 to ensure the rules had been complied with.

A Commons spokesman said: 'The spokesman said: 'Destruction dates for records are prescribed by the House of Commons Authorised Records Disposal Practice (ARDP) policy, and in compliance with the Data Protection Act.

'The retention period for general financial data, of which Members' Expenses is a sub-set, is three years after the current financial year finishes. The long-standing policy on retention of MPs' expenses records was originally agreed by the Members Estimate Committee (MEC).'

'In accordance with the ARDP, the disposal of records relating to Members' expenses claims pre-2010 was carried out on a routine basis at various times each year up to 2014, four years after the House of Commons' oversight of the MPs' expenses arrangements finished.'
