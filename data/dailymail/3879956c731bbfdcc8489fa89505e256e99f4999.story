Proudly brandishing an axe in front of his bare chest, a balaclava-clad robber strikes a sickening pose before attacking a teenager with a similar weapon in the street.

Lewis Patterson, 22, armed himself with a double-edged axe while high on drugs, and along with two accomplices, threatened a 17-year-old boy who just happened to pass by them.

Hull Crown Court heard the gang, made of Patterson, Louis Coult and Christopher Matthews, struck him in the face and put 
the axe to his neck.

One of the thugs swung the axe, only narrowly 
missing the boy's head.

It became embedded in a fence and Coult pulled it free, held it to their victim's face and demanded he empty his pockets.

The boy handed over his wallet, which contained £10, before he was frogmarched to a cashpoint and withdrew £250.

Despite being arrested and charged with robbery, one of the men, Patterson, 22, went on to assault another victim after being released on bail.

He was then bailed a second time and went on the run.

Now Patterson and the other two offenders have been jailed for a total of 15 years.

Yesterday, the court heard that 
Patterson, along with Matthews, 30, and Coult, 23, took M-Cat on 
September 20 and hid in an alleyway.

Prosecutor Jharna Jobes said: 'The victim said he considered trying to run but had nowhere to go and was frightened of what they would do to him if he failed to get away.'

It took the police two weeks to catch all of the gang.

Jailing each of the offenders for five years, Judge Michael Mettyear said: 'This was absolutely disgraceful behaviour.

'You all disguised your faces. You picked on a 17-year-old.

'He was struck and then threatened with this double-bladed axe. He must have been terrified.

'There are aggravating features here. There was more than one offender, the degree of detention of your victim, he was taken off, you wore disguises and your victim was vulnerable.'

All three pleaded guilty to robbery.

Scene: The victim was frogmarched to this cash point in Bransholme, Hull, and forced to withdrew £250

Coult's solicitor Paul Norton said: 'It was the first time he had taken M-Cat. The effects of that drug are now becoming all too apparent.

'He has never committed offences of this seriousness before.

'He is remorseful and appreciates what a terrifying ordeal it must have been.'

Addressing Patterson in particular, the judge said: 'You committed a nasty assault occasioning actual bodily harm when you still had this robbery hanging over your head.

'You went out and committed this other offence in drunken night-time violence.'

Patterson's barrister Richard Thompson said his client was remorseful and was only on the run for a short period of time.

He said: 'There was no gratuitous violence used towards the complainant.

'He was simply the victim of a theft of money stolen by people under the influence of drugs.'

Judge Mettyear hit out at the police, CPS and magistrates for allowing all three men to be bailed for such a serious offence when they first appeared at court.

After their release, Patterson punched a man in Hull city centre, on January 29.

His victim had to be taken to hospital by ambulance and received three butterfly stitches to his eyebrow, suffered three cuts to his cheekbone and had swelling and bruising to his body.

In 2011, Patterson was sent to a young offenders' institute after pleading guilty to burglary - when he was shot by the homeowner with his air rifle.
