A huge thunderstorm saw lightning hit the newly completed One World Trade Centre making for dramatic scenes in New York on Sunday evening as storms battered the city and raged across the east coast of America.

The thunderstorm provided New Yorkers some much-needed relief from a weekend of sweltering temperatures while also providing one keen photographer the opportunity to capture these dramatic images.

Storms flattened trees and utility poles in parts of northern New England, delayed flights in New York City and caused a tornado to touch down in South Carolina.

Super storm: New York and the east coast of the US were battered by strong winds and rain. The storm caused power cuts leaving many still without electricity on Monday.

The weather service issued a rare tornado warning as a line of thunderstorms raced through New Hampshire into western Maine.  
By early Monday, more than 12,000 customers were still without power in 
Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine, down from more than 40,000 outages at 
the peak.

In northwestern South Carolina, a 
tornado reportedly knocked a home off its foundation and blew part of 
the roof off, said Taylor Jones, director of emergency management for 
Anderson County. Some trees were blown down and there was heavy rain, 
but no widespread damage. No injuries were reported.

The stormy weather in the New York 
City region shortened the Boston Red Sox-New York Yankees game to 5 1/2 
innings and produced backups at major airports. But by early Monday, 
delays were down to 15 minutes or less at airports on the East Coast.

The Big Apple has been sweltering in record temperatures for several days before the thunderstorm.

Lightning strike: lightning strikes the newly completed world trade centre during a dramatic thunderstorm in New York over the weekend.

Temperatures hit 90 degrees 
Fahrenheit (32 degrees Celsius) for the third day in a row in parts of 
New York and New Jersey on Saturday, making it the first official heat 
wave of the year. 

Temperatures peaked at 32 degrees 
Celsius in Central Park and 33 degrees in Newark, New Jersey on Saturday
 afternoon after hitting similar sweltering numbers Thursday and Friday.

Keen photographer 
Nick Carwile, 18, was in the city visiting family and was fortunate to 
have his camera with him when the storm broke.

But it wasn't until he looked closer 
that he noticed the bright blue bolt that had spectacularly struck the 
top of the iconic 1,776ft tall landmark.

Nick captured these dramatic image 
from his aunt and uncle's apartment in Greenwich Village, Manhattan. He 
had never witnessed serious storms where he lives in Alaska.

He said: 'At first I didn't really know what was going on - I started taking pictures just hoping something would happen.

'When the bolts of lightning struck, there was a huge flash of light and
 less than two seconds later the loudest thunder I have ever heard 
rattled my room - I almost picked up my camera in fear of it falling off
 the window ledge.

'After the exposure was complete I couldn't believe what I saw - I felt amazingly lucky to finally capture a strike.

'I didn't know where the lightning had stuck until I looked at the picture again 20 minutes later.

'I actually didn't notice it had struck One World Trade but it was an incredible feeling to know I'd got that exact moment.'

The U.S has been battered by extreme weather in the last month including a two
mile wide tornado which tore through the suburbs of Oklahoma City leaving a trail of devastation reminiscent of a war zone as it leveled entire streets and
buildings killing 13 people

The tornado cut a 20
mile long swath of destruction - flattening an elementary school and medical centre in the town of Moore as the tornado winds reached
upwards of 200 mph. New York itself has see an increase in storms in recent years including the Superstorm Sandy last autumn which caused major flooding throughout the city.

The final part of One Wold Trade Centre was only recently completed with the final component of the antenna installed on top the skyscraper on 10 May this making it the third tallest building in the world.
