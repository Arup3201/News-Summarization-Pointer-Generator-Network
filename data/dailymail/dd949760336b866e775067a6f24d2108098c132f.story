Tony Blair warned Labour must not return to the comfort of the 1980s, opposing everything but offering no leadership

Ed Miliband was embroiled in a damaging row with Tony Blair yesterday over his kneejerk resistance to austerity and welfare cuts.

The former Prime Minister warned Mr Miliband he risked reducing Labour to a party of protest, out of touch with mainstream opinion.

Mr Blair insisted the Labour leader’s belief that the centre ground of British politics has shifted to the left in the wake of the financial crisis was a fantasy.

In his most significant intervention in domestic politics since leaving No 10, he said Labour must get out of ‘the comfort zone’, and that people wanted a party that offered answers to problems rather than merely being a mouthpiece for anger.

He also suggested Mr Miliband needed to be more realistic on issues such as the spiralling housing benefit bill, spending cuts and education reforms.

He was backed by former Home Secretary David Blunkett and former Business Minister Pat McFadden.

Mr Miliband, however, suggested he regarded the former Prime Minister, who won three general elections, as yesterday’s man, insisting he was not interested in ‘old solutions’.

Mr Blair’s intervention comes as Mr Miliband faces growing unrest from a section of his party over his refusal to back any of the Government’s attempts to rein in the bloated welfare budget.

He has previously been circumspect 
about criticising Mr Miliband, but hit out in an article for the 
Left-leaning New Statesman magazine.

Mr Blair insisted that ‘the financial 
crisis has not brought a decisive shift to the Left’ and warned that 
politics was returning to that of the 1980s – with the Tories offering 
fiscal responsibility and Labour simply opposing austerity measures.

Labour must not become simply a 
‘repository for people’s anger’, the former Prime Minister wrote. ‘Parts
 of the political landscape that had been cast in shadow for some years,
 at least under New Labour and the first years of coalition government, 
are illuminated in sharp relief.

In an extraordinary move Labour leader Ed Miliband, pictured this week launching his local election campaign, dismissed the intervention from Mr Blair insisting the party had to 'move on'

‘The Conservative Party is back 
clothing itself in the mantle of fiscal responsibility, buttressed by 
moves against “benefit scroungers”, immigrants squeezing out British 
workers and – of course – Labour profligacy.

‘The Labour Party is back as the party
 opposing “Tory cuts”, highlighting the cruel consequences of the 
Conservative policies on welfare and representing the disadvantaged and 
vulnerable.’

Mr Blair said the scenario was more ‘menacing’ for his party than for the Tories.

‘They are now going to inspire 
loathing on the Left. But they’re used to that,’ he said.

Mr Blair's article will be seen as a damning criticism of the leadership during the 1980s of Neil Kinnock, who has been a strong backer of Mr Miliband

‘They’re back 
on the old territory of harsh reality, tough decisions, piercing the 
supposed veil of idealistic fantasy that prevents the Left from 
governing sensibly...

‘For Labour, the opposite is true. This scenario is more menacing than it seems.’

In an apparent swipe at Mr Miliband’s 
policy vacuum,  Mr Blair warned the public wanted to ‘know where we’re 
coming from because that is  a clue as to where we would go, if 
elected’.

Mr Miliband insisted: ‘I always take 
Tony Blair very, very seriously, but... I am leading in my own way. 
Political parties have to move forwards not backwards, not going back to
 old solutions.’ A Labour spokesman said: ‘It is by challenging old ways
 of doing things, showing we have understood what we did right and wrong
 during our time in office, that One Nation Labour will win back 
people’s trust.’

However, Mr Blunkett said: ‘He [Mr 
Blair] is right to remind us that the pendulum did not swing leftwards 
and there is much to do.’

Mr McFadden said: ‘Advice from a three-times election-winning Prime Minister should always be taken seriously.’

Tory chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Tony
 Blair is right to warn that Labour aren’t a credible party of 
government under Ed Miliband.

'The only plan Labour have is more of what 
got us into this mess in the first place – more spending, more borrowing
 and more debt.’
