Pictured in his white cowboy hat rushing horrifically injured Boston bombing survivor Jeff Bauman away from the finishing line, Carlos Arredondo is one half of possibly the most iconic image from that fateful day in April.

The Costa Rican native became the face of 'Boston Strong', as the proud city battled to recover from the scars left by the two Tsarnaev brothers.

But behind the bravado, Arredondo was and still is fighting his own demons, the hero of Boston tortured by the anguish caused by the deaths of his two young sons and how that pain propelled him to help Bauman as he lay bleeding on the floor.

'I told him to hold on,' Carlos said of the moment he ran to help the injured and saw Bauman lying on the floor with only protruding bones where his legs once were.

'He looked very pale. I thought he was going to die.'

Carlos didn't know his name was Jeff at that moment - he only knew that he looked young enough to be Alex, the son he lost in Iraq, or Brian, his boy who tragically killed himself in the years after that.

The selfless bravery the 52-year-old showed that day on Boylston Street was captured forever by Associated Press photographer Charles Krupa - his image of Jeff Bauman's ashen face and Carlos in his white cowboy hat splashed across the front pages of the world's papers.

Within that one flash of a picture, photogenic Carlos was instantly propelled to fame and hungry reporters began to delve into the hero's life - discovering his dark struggle.

They discovered that Carlos has endured two divorces, suffers severe depression and is bi-polar and of course lost his two sons.

Driven by guilt over his two boys, Carlos feels he is a different man when he goes home and takes the hat off.

He told the Orlando Sun-Sentinel that he feels that God is punishing him for his mistakes.

But, since April, Carlos has become the public face of the rehabilitation of Boston, he eats out for free and appeared alongside James Taylor as he sang 'American the Beautiful' at the World Series.

'I don't know how long this is going to last,' Carlos said in October to the Sun Sentinel. 'I didn't ask for any of this.'

At home when he isn't appearing at a charity function or a commemorative event, Carlos's thoughts delve into the dark.

Thoughts of his two boys keep him awake at night, 'There have been times when I just cry and cry for days,' Carlos said. 'I never stop thinking about them.'

His second ex-wife, Mélida, who still lives with him in Boston, worries when there is no answer if she calls during the day.

She fears he may have killed himself.

Indeed, the pain for Carlos began in August 2004 when his son Alex was killed by a sniper's bullet to the head.

Alex enlisted in the army in August 2001 and because he was 17 need his mother, Victoria Foley. to sign papers to allow him to join.

The events of September 11 only strengthened his resolve and his first deployment was to Iraq in 2003.

In one poignant letter he wrote to his father, Alex said, 'I'm not afraid of dying. I am more afraid of what will happen to all the ones that I love if something happens to me.'

But on August 25th, 2004 everything changed when a van arrived outside his then home in South Florida.

Three Marines in full dress blue uniforms got out and asked if he was Mr. Carlos Arredondo.

'Are you the father of Marine Lance Cpl. Alexander Scott Arredondo?'

'Yes.'

'The commandant of the Marine Corps has entrusted me to express his deep regret that your son, Alexander, was killed in action today in Najaf, Iraq...'

What followed became a blur to Carlos, but he does know that he became enraged after he asked the Marines to leave and they said no - because he needed to sign legal documents.

He grabbed a hammer, a container, a propane torch and set fire to the Marine's van and himself.

Carlos was taken to Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, then transferred to the Ryder Trauma Center at Jackson Hospital in Miami. He had burns on 26 percent of his body.

His actions that day proved polarizing to the nation - was he broken by the news his son died in a controversial war, or was Carlos selfishly stealing the limelight from his hero son?

'I lost my mind,' he said recently of the incident, which led him to be know as the Burning Dad.

In the months after the incident, Carlos sought out the three Marines who informed him of his son's death to apologize.

Police decided to not press charges and even his hospital bills were waived.

Because he was the father of a fallen veteran, Carlos' application for U.S. citizenship was speeded up and he was made on in December 2006.

The photographer who was there to capture the event - The Associated Press's Charles Krupa, the same photographer who would later snap the iconic shot of Carlos with Jeff in Boston.

However, the stresses and strains of his burns and his continuing grief over his son Alex proved too much.

He was admitted to McLean Hospital in Belmont Massachusetts, a psychiatric hospital, having moved away from Florida following his son's death.

But for Carlos, there was worse pain to come.

Alex's brother Brian, was 17 in 2004 and had been struggling since he had left to joint the army.

He was having problems at school and had a brush with the law after stealing jewelry from a girlfriends house.

Brian began to fall into problems with drugs, using cocaine and heroin and moved into an apartment in a shed in his mother's backyard in Massachusetts.

His first suicide attempt came in 2006 when he tried to strangle himself and it failed.

He then tried to commit suicide by cop in 2011 - brandishing a machete at them - only to be subdued and placed in a mental institution.

But on December 19, 2011, Brian's mother went  to check on him in the backyard shed and found Brian hanging by an electrical chord wrapped around his neck - he was 24.

Victoria called Carlos with the news.'No, God, no!!!!' Carlos screamed. 'Not again!!!!'

Carlos drifted after this.

He returned to Costa Rica and traveled with a group of bereaved veteran's families to Europe on a fallen military members.

The week before this year's marathon, Carlos returned to Boston.

There were various groups that sent out runners to memorialize war casualties and a military group called Tough Ruckers that would walk the 26.2-mile course in full gear, carrying 40-pound rucksacks.

Carlos was there to cheer them on.

Oddly, just before Carlos waded in to help the wounded, he took pictures.

This caused the FBI to wonder why, in short, they wondered whether Carlos was involved, so unusual was it to take pictures of blown-off limbs and bleeding injured.

However, the suspicions quickly lifted in the days after the attacks and now as the face of 'Boston Strong' - Carlos uses his fame to keep himself busy.

'I'm just hoping for the best and praying,' Carlos said. 'There's no script for this.'
