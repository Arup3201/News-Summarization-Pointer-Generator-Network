Peroxide blondes must now apply for photographic ID to buy the strongest hair bleach, under little-noticed new European anti-terror rules.

Model car buffs are also hit, as chemicals they use for fuel are controlled under the new scheme, run by the Home Office.

Anyone wishing to buy such materials must pay £40 for a three-year licence, or face two years’ jail. Shopkeepers can also be imprisoned if they do not check papers.

Applicants will face a criminal record check and scrutiny of medical records for signs of mental health problems as well as questions about why they want the chemicals.

Josie Appleton, of pressure group The Manifesto Club, said: ‘This is treating everybody like terrorists. Surely terrorists would be innovative enough to buy their explosives elsewhere? Innocent hobbyists will suffer.’

Seven substances controlled under the rules include the highest-strength hydrogen peroxide bleach, the model car fuel nitromethane and chemicals used to make fireworks.

The Home Office refused to say how many people had so far applied for – or been refused – one since the rules were introduced on September 2.

Muslim extremists behind the 7/7 terror attacks on London in 2005 used bombs made with hydrogen peroxide from hair dye. The attacks left 52 people dead and more than 700 injured.
