A dog lover who died of a broken heart just weeks after his German Shepherd was put to sleep has left almost £400,000 to the RSPCA.

Kevin Johnson, 59, bequeathed £364,568.68 to the animal charity in a final tribute to his Alsatian, Chelsea.

Mr Johnson handed over all his savings to the RSPCA as well as all the cash from the sale of his cottage to say a massive thank you after he'd adopted her from his local rescue centre.

Mr Johnson has donated all of his savings to the Friends of RSPCA Southridge near Potters Bar, after both he and his beloved dog passed away

The nurseryman suffered a massive heart attack and passed away just two months after his best mate and constant companion Chelsea had a deadly stroke.

The animal lover, of Puckeridge, near Stevenage, Hertfordshire, has donated all his wealth to the Friends of RSPCA Southridge, near Potters Bar.

His elderly parents, Margaret and John, had both died and he had no children or siblings to leave his savings to.

Mr Johnson, who ran his family's Clockhouse Nurseries in Enfield, north London, adopted Chelsea from RSPCA Southridge after losing his previous two German Shepherds, Max and Heidi.

Kevin owned Chelsea for about seven years and she was nearly ten when she died.

Mr Johnson's aunt, Myfanwy Gillham, 
90, of Enfield, said: 'Kevin was totally devastated at losing Chelsea - 
she was the apple of his eye and his biggest friend. He just lost heart after she went.

'His
mother had died and Kevin said as he now had more time because he 
didn't have mum to look after he would get another German Shepherd.

'We went to Southridge together one day on the off chance of finding one and immediately spotted Chelsea.

'They bonded straight away from their very first meeting as soon as he set eyes on her. She had been very badly treated and Kevin gave her a whole new life.'

The mother-of-two and grandmother-of-one added: 'Chelsea was always with him, playing all day at the garden nursery. He never went anywhere without her.

'And then one morning he came downstairs and found Chelsea collapsed. She couldn't even stand up. It was a real bolt out of the blue - she was a real ball of energy and very fit.

'The chap from the pub over the road came over and he and Kevin took her straight to the vet, but nothing could be done and she had to be put to sleep.

'Kevin couldn't get over it and started letting his business go. It was totally unexpected when Chelsea had the stroke because she was always such a lively dog.

'Two months later he had a heart attack and was found dead on his bed. We're sure he died of a broken heart.'

Mrs Gillham said he had remembered Chelsea in the best possible way by leaving all his money to the RSPCA.

'Kevin's left a fantastic legacy to the animal centre ' and the gift will help to rescue and look after a great many dogs like Chelsea,' she said.

Grateful Terry Pavey, chairman of the 
Friends, said: 'Words cannot express enough our gratitude to Kevin for 
leaving us this staggering inheritance.

'It will do so much good, notably safeguarding our fostering scheme for years to come.'

A new dog agility and play area at Southridge will now be dedicated to the memory of Kevin and Chelsea and a special plaque is to be put up in their memory.
