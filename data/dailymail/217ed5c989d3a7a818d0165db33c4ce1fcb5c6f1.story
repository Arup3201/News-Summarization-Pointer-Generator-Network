Fast food fans may soon see their meals served at the table on a plate and a knife and fork if an experiment at an Australian branch of McDonalds proves to be popular.

The outlet in the suburb of Warilla, south of Sydney, has been given the green light from the international giant's global headquarters in Chicago to trial a more formal service for five weeks.

The couple who run the franchise Glenn 
and Katia Dwarte, came up with the idea after they started serving their
parents using cutlery during their weekly visits.

No longer finger food: An Australian McDonald's will be first to offer plates, cutlery and table service

Catching on: Other customers noticed the cutlery and began to request similar service

Other customers noticed the cutlery and began to request similar service, reported Illawarra Mercury.

The couple were so taken by their patrons response that put a plan into action and decided to pitch it to the fast-food giant.

When McDonald’s Australia chief executive Catriona Noble visited before Christmas the Dwarte's pitched the idea to her and let her get the full dining experience serving her with crockery and glassware.

Even the fizzy drinks are served in glasses in the trail which started on Monday.

Mrs Dwarte said the initial reaction from diners had been positive.

'Most of the people who came in decided to try it,' she said.

'Most
were quite excited. We actually had a group of eight people who asked 
me to take a photo of them so they could put it on Facebook. We are also
providing customer surveys so we can gauge the feedback.’

McDonald’s Chicago headquarters has even designed and produced a flyer promoting the service..

The Dwartes have owned the Warilla restaurant for 20 years.

Mrs Dwarte has been involved with McDonald’s since 1978 when she started working at McDonald’s Warrawong, the first in Australia with a drive-through service.
