He shot an unarmed teen: Dale Farris, 65, faces multiple charges for shooting at a group teens, striking one of them, armed only with toilet paper

A rural Tennessee man shot a teenager armed only with toilet paper.

One of a group of teens toilet papering his principal’s home Oct 20 was peppered by several pellets that came from a gun fired by neighbour Dale Farris, officials said.

The teens were papering the yard of Huntland School principal Ken Bishop, an Estill Springs neighbour of Mr Farris, according to the Times Free Press.

‘Some kids got out at a residence over there to roll it with toilet paper and this gentleman came out of his residence a couple of houses over and shot one of the teenagers who was rolling this other guy's yard,’ a Franklin County Sheriff’s Office spokesperson told the paper.

Mr Farris, 65, fired at least two shots at the pranksters, striking a 15-year-old in the right foot, inner left knee, right palm, right thigh and right side of his torso, the Times Free Press said.

‘He got peppered pretty good,’ the spokesperson said. ‘The problem is they were not on his [Farris'] property and they were not doing anything to his property.’

Some of the teens involved attend the school Mr Bishop presides over as principal, the report noted. He declined to press charges against anyone involved.

Authorities charged the vigilante with aggravated assault and reckless endangerment. He was released from custody after posting a $125,000 bond, according to the Times Free Press.

When reached for comment by MailOnline, Mr Farris snarled ‘don’t bother me’ and slammed his phone down.

Mr Farris has no prior criminal history, according to court records. He is due in court again Dec 5.A sheriff’s office spokesperson could not be reached for further comment.

The teenager did not suffer any life-threatening injuries from the gun shots.
