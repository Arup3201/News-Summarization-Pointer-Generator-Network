It may have been the official beginning of autumn yesterday, but summer was refusing to go quietly.

Much of Britain basked in glorious sunshine over the weekend, despite trees and plants showing signs of the next season.

Thousands took to parks, rivers and woodland to enjoy the first of the stunning autumnal colours while the sun was still shining.

Yesterday marked the autumnal equinox, nature’s first day of autumn, 
when the sun passes directly above the equator and  day and night become
nearly equal in length.

But it felt more like summer across most of the country with blue skies and highs of 23C in some areas of the south east.

The sunshine was perfect for brave skinny-dippers who stripped off at dawn yesterday in a world record attempt.

They
failed to break it, but 180 people took part, jumping into the North 
Sea off Druridge Bay, Northumberland. And the good weather is not quite 
over yet.

The Met Office said temperatures will be unseasonably warm 
today.

Even parts of Scotland can expect the mercury to rise as high as 23C, while parts of England could  feel even warmer.

A Met Office spokesman said temperatures are currently about six degrees higher than average for September.

Photographer Mark Upton said he saw the heather and 'just had to go and take a picture of the stunning heather'

He
added: ‘That [warmth] will last for the next couple of days  but will 
begin to become more changeable by the end of the week.’

Elsewhere, purple heather was in full bloom at Bratley View, in the New Forest, a favourite spot with walkers and photographers.

Photographer Mark Upton, 25, from Portsmouth, said he had to stop when he saw the heather in the evening light.

He said: 'It was a very spontaneous thing. I was driving through the New Forest and the light began to drop and I just had to go and take a picture of the stunning heather.

'The heather is in full colour and the leaves and grass is starting to turn a golden brown- mix that with the sunset and it's one of the greatest places to sit back and relax.'

However, summer is not quite over yet. The Met Office say temperatures will be unseasonably warm tomorrow.

Aberdeenshire should expect temperatures to rise to as much as 23C, while parts of England could feel even warmer.

A Met Office spokesman said temperatures are currently about six degrees higher than average for September.

He said: 'Locally it will be very warm for this time of year. That will last for the next couple of days but will begin to become more changeable by the end of the week.'

The warm weather was perfect for brave skinny-dippers who stripped off today at dawn in an attempt to break the world record.

The hardy souls jumped into the North Sea off Druridge Bay, Northumberland, in an event supported by the National Trust. 

All proceeds raised were split between mental health charity MIND and the National Trust's conservation work along the Northumberland Coast.

Although 180 people took part, it fell shy of the current skinny-dipping record of 506. 

Jax Higginson, the event organiser, said: 'It was perfect. The sea was like a mill pond and the sky was very clear.

A sea of golden sunflowers at Newton Rigg College near Penrith, Cumbria gave the area a taste of summer today despite it being the first day of autumn

More than 100 people braved the cold to take part in a dawn skinny dip world record attempt at Druridge Bay in Northumberland

The record attempt raised money for mental health charity MIND and for the conservation work of The National Trust

'It wasn't cold at all. People stayed in for ages, most people were in the water for ten to 15 minutes - I was in there for nearly half an hour.

'Everybody was just really feeling alive and being part of nature. 'Nobody was shy - everyone just took part fully.

'The atmosphere was really warm, there was a lot of love.

'Most of the registration money was going to charity so that's £2,000 straight away.

'A gentleman that came last year had his 72nd birthday yesterday and he took part again this year - I think it's now his birthday celebration.

'There was children aged five and six going in their with their parents.'
