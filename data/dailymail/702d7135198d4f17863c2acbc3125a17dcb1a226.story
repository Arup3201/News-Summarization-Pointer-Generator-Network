An historic Grade Two-listed county hall has been subjected to 'shocking' damage after being wrecked by drug addicts and homeless people.

The imposing County Hall in Ipswich, for decades the centre of local government in Suffolk, has fallen into disrepair and been systematically destroyed by junkies, yobs and vandals.

The revered 176-year-old structure, built the year before Queen Victoria came to the throne, has seen its fireplaces ripped out and wooden panelling stripped, while there is a tree growing through a smashed window.

Photographers who specialise in charting urban building damage have revealed how the hall is completely unsecure, with mattresses inside indicating that drug addicts and tramps have taken up residence inside.

The Ipswich building was Suffolk's County Hall until 2004.

Built at the start of the Victorian era in 1836, the grand hall functioned as Ipswich's courthouse in its early days, and became County Hall in 1906.

After being renovated in the 1980s, it was closed in 2004 when Ipswich Borough Council moved to Endeavour House, a new building in a different part of the town.

Ipswich Borough Council are said to have met the building's owners earlier this year to try to ensure it was secured.

One photographer who took images inside the building said: 'Inside the whole place has been trashed.

Broken windows are a common feature inside the hall, which was last occupied in 2004

'It is totally unsecured and there was no problem getting in at all. Once inside it was shocking to see.

'There are mattresses inside so it is clear that people are living there and there are signs of people using it to take drugs.'

The council was so concerned that it was placed on its 'Buildings at Risk' register earlier this year.

Councillor with responsibility for planning and development at the borough, Carole Jones, was horrified to hear how the once glorious county hall has been torn apart.

Cllr Jones said: 'We had thought it had been secured.

'This is dreadful news and we shall have to see what can be done.

'I know the police are concerned about the building as well.'

There are no immediate plans to redevelop County Hall, which was sold by the council shortly after it moved out of the building.

Labour's Bryony Rudkin was county council leader at the time of its move to Endeavour House eight years ago.

Outraged by the attacks on the building, she said: 'It's never been a beautiful building but it is very imposing and it has a great deal of history there.'
