'Radical Islam' was the pass code for entry into the 2016 presidential tryout held this week at the Conservative Political Action Conference.

A mecca for tea party activists, CPAC served as the unofficial kick off to the upcoming presidential contest. 

Roughly 10,000 conservatives from across the country packed the  Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center at National Harbor, Maryland, just down the river from the nation's capitol, to listen to GOP presidential hopefuls clobber the current occupant of the White House over his 'failed' leadership – particularly when it comes to fighting terrorists abroad.

The cavalcade of the Republicans vying for the Oval Office decried President Barack Obama's calls for the global community to ignore the religious beliefs of extremists and fought to position themselves as the heir apparent to the office of the executive.

'Bizarre Orwellian doublespeak': Texas Sen. Ted Cruz blasted President Barack Obama for refusing to refer to ISIS as an Islamic terror group

'Egypt and Jordan recognize that they are at war with radical Islam; isn't it about time that our president proclaimed the same?' former Texas Gov. Rick Perry declared during a session on Friday morning.

'We need a commander in chief who will actually stand up and defend the United States of America. We cannot defeat radical Islamic terrorism with a president who is unwilling to utter words radical Islamic terrorism,' fellow Texan Ted Cruz told conference guests on Thursday afternoon while blasting Obama's 'bizarre Orwellian doublespeak.'

Echoing Cruz, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker that evening said the country needs a leader 'who stands up and realizes that radical Islamic terrorism is a threat to our way of life and to all freedom-loving people around the world.'

'We need a president, a leader, who will stand up and say, "we will take the fight to them, and not wait for them to take the fight to us",' Walker proclaimed.

He later suggested, during the question and answer period of his appearance, that his 2012 fight with public sector unions prepared him to handle terrorist threats.

'If I can do that with 100,000 protesters, I can do the same across the world,' he posited. 

Asked about the viscous terrorists and what it will take to destroy them during his session, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio quipped, 'They're not Presbyterian' before laying out a strategy for victory.

'ISIS is a radical Sunni Islamic group. They need to be defeated on the ground by a Sunni military force with air support from the United States,' Rubio said, taking a stand against a large deployment of U.S. troops to Iraq.

Continuing he said if the U.S. puts 'together a coalition of armed regional governments to confront [ISIS] on the ground with U.S. special forces support, logistical support, intelligence support and the most devastating air support possible,' he said, 'and you will wipe ISIS out.'

Speaking at the conference later that day, Rick Santorum, the 2012 runner up for the Republican nomination for the presidency, said, 'If ISIS wants to establish a seventh-century caliphate, well, let's oblige them by bombing them back to the seventh century.' 

Urging the president to assume a position of leadership in the international community's fight against the 'genocidal thugs,' former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin insisted that  the religion of radical Islamists cannot be overlooked.

'Pretending it’s not there doesn’t make it go away,' she said. Calling it something else won’t make it so.' 

Palin, a tease who is not expected to run for president but remains a possible contender, said the State Department, whose spokesperson recently proclaimed the U.S. cannot kill its way out of a war with ISIS, is 'naive.'

'Really? Tell that to the Nazis,' Palin remarked. 'Oh wait, you can’t because they’re dead. We killed them.'

Obama 'has disqualified himself, and shown himself incapable of being our commander-in-chief' by refusing to characterize savages in the Middle East as Muslims, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal told a crowd later that day.

'We don’t need a war on international poverty; we need a war on the evil that is radical Islamic terrorism,' said Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said the Obama administration has a 'total misunderstanding of what this Islamic terrorist threat is'

'He says we are not at war with Islam; well, certainly we’re not at war with Islam, but we are at war with radical Islam,' he asserted.

Ousted Pennsylvania Sen. Santorum, once the upper chamber's third-ranking Republican, told convention-goers Obama's 'profound lack of experience' fueled many of America's problems at home and abroad.

'Commander in chief is not an entry-level position,' Santorum said. 'And the Oval Office is no place for on-the-job training, not in times like this.'

The former lawmaker said that unlike Obama, he predicted the 'gathering storm.'

'In the 1930s we could have known what the threat was. All we needed to do was read their books, and we will know what they want to do to the U.S.' he stated. 

Jindal derided the Obama administration for contending that terrorism could be counteracted by diminishing poverty in countries that are hot beds for radical activity.

'We don’t need a war on international poverty; we need a war on the evil that is radical Islamic terrorism,' Jindal argued. 'These individuals are going to go straight to hell, exactly where they belong.' 

Likewise, Cruz said administration's jobs for jihadis approach 'utter and complete nonsense.'

Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, the last in the large group of Republican presidential wanabees to address the gathering, said the Obama administration has a 'total misunderstanding of what this Islamic terrorist threat is.'

That 'is very dangerous because it doesn't allow you to have the right strategy to deal with this,' Bush said.

'We need to heighten awareness of what this threat means and be honest about it,' he stated, adding that he believes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday 'is going to be really important.'

'He's going to be able to tell the truth on this,' Bush said of Netanyahu's address, which is likely to be critical of the Obama administration's policies toward Iran, a caliphate state.

Retired neurosugreon Ben Carson, a long-shot contender for the presidency 'radical Islamic terrorists all over the world' threaten to 'destroy' America and the 'Shia in Iran are every bit as dangerous, perhaps even more dangerous' than ISIS.

'We could take our eye off the ball as they develop nuclear weapons,' he warned. 

Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul told the conservative audience that electing another Democrat of Obama's ilk, namely Hillary Clinton, would make 'us less safe.'

'Hillary’s war in Libya allowed thousands of surface-to-air missiles to fall into the hands of radical Islamists.'

Jihadists now 'run amok' in the country, he said. 'They swim in our swimming pool,' he added disdainfully.

'I believe Hillary Clinton’s abdication of responsibility, her refusal to provide adequate defense for Benghazi, her dereliction of duty should forever preclude her from high office,' the freshman lawmaker asserted, denigrating his possible general election foe.

'It’s time for Hillary Clinton to permanently retire.'
