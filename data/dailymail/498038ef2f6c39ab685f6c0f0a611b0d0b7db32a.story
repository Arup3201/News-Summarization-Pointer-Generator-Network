A college friend of Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was convicted Monday of impeding the investigation into the bombing which claimed the lives of three people and injured more than 250 others.

Azamat Tazhayakov was charged with obstruction of justice and conspiracy, with prosecutors saying he agreed with another friend's plan to remove Tsarnaev's backpack containing altered fireworks from his dorm room a few days after the 2013 bombing.

His trial was the first stemming from the bombing, which killed three and injured more than 260 near the marathon's finish line.

Tazhayakov's mother sobbed loudly and rocked in her seat as the jury announced the guilty verdicts, which it reached on the third day of deliberations.

Tazhayakov's lawyers argued that it was the other friend, Dias Kadyrbayev, who removed the items from the University of Massachusetts-Dartmouth dorm room and then threw them away.

Prosecutors told the jury that both men shared in the decision to remove the items and get rid of them to protect Tsarnaev. Kadyrbayev faces a separate trial in September.

'They did it to protect their close friend,' said Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephanie Siegmann

A third friend, Robel Phillipos, is charged with lying to investigators.

During Tazhayakov's trial, FBI agents testified that Tazhayakov - a foreign student from the Central Asian nation of Kazakhstan  - told them he and Kadyrbayev decided to take the backpack, fireworks and Tsarnaev's laptop computer hours after Kadyrbayev received a text message from Tsarnaev that said he could go to his dorm room and 'take what's there.'

The items were removed hours after the FBI released photos and video of Tsarnaev and his brother, Tamerlan, and identified them as suspects in the bombing.

But Tazhayakov's lawyer, Matthew 
Myers, said his client was a naive college kid who was prosecuted 
because he was a 'friend of the bomber.'

Myers said Tazhayakov and 
another friend, Robel Phillipos, sat passively watching a movie in 
Tsarnaev's dorm room as Kadyrbayev took the backpack.

Prosecutors alleged that Tazhayakov knew the identity of the suspected bombers — Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev — before the public found out, allegedly texting Kadyrbayev, “i think they got his brother” hours before the public knew.

Prosecutors
 acknowledged that Kadyrbayev is the one who actually threw away the 
items taken from Tsarnaev's room, but they said Tazhayakov agreed with 
the plan.

One month before the bombing, the prosecution alleges that Tsarnaev met with his friends at a restaurant and told them how he could make a bomb and then spoke about martyrdom.

'It was good to die … as a martyr, as you would die with a smile on your face and go straight to heaven,' Tsarnaev told them, according to Siegmann.

The backpack and 
fireworks were later recovered in a New Bedford landfill. Prosecutors 
said the fireworks had been emptied of their explosive powder — an 
ingredient that can be used to make bombs.

Tamerlan
 Tsarnaev was killed in a shootout with police. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev 
escaped, but was found later that day, wounded and hiding in a boat 
parked in a backyard in nearby Watertown.

Dzhokhar
 Tsarnaev has pleaded not guilty in the bombing and is scheduled to 
stand trial in November. He faces the possibility of the death penalty 
if convicted.

Tazhayakov is 
scheduled to be sentenced on Oct. 16. He faces a five-year maximum for 
conspiracy and 20-year maximum for obstruction but likely will get a lot
 less under sentencing guidelines.

He will be sentenced on October 16, U.S. District Judge Douglas Woodlock said.

Kadyrbayev is awaiting trial on the same charges later this year, while Phillipos faces the lesser charge of lying to investigators.

During six days of testimony at U.S. District Court in Boston, jurors heard FBI agents testify that Tazhayakov told them he had been present when the items were removed and later watched as a garbage truck hauled away the backpack.

They also saw a videotaped statement from Kadyrbayev's girlfriend saying that she told him to dispose of the backpack when she realized the FBI was hunting for Tsarnaev. Tazhayakov's attorneys had said their client never touched the backpack or laptop, contending that Kadyrbayev did so and later dropped the backpack into a dumpster.

None of the three men were charged with playing any role in the largest mass-casualty attack on U.S. soil since September 11, 2001, which injured more than 260 people in addition to killing three.

Tsarnaev is awaiting trial on charges that carry the death penalty. His older brother, Tamerlan, who prosecutors contend also played a key role in the attack, died following a gun battle with police several days after the bombing
