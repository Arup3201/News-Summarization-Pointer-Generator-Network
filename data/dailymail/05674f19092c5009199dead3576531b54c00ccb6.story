Destroyed: About 200 homes were fully destroyed in the blaze and a further 200 more partially burn-out in the fire which was allegedly started by a tree hitting a power pole

Devastation: A class action case, worth about $200 million, has been brought before power company Endeavor Energy by 400 residents in the Blue Mountains

About 3,500 hectares where burnt out in the Springwood and Winmalee area with strong winds and bad conditions fueling its ferocity

He said: 'The Springwood and Winmalee fire started when poorly-maintained trees fell onto electrical conductors in Linksview Road, Springwood' on October 17 last year.

The main focus of the class action case was to recoup the damages allegedly caused by Endeavor Energy for the affected homeowners.

'We believe there are five to six hundred people affected and we believe that the total quantum of loss is going to be in the order of $200 million,' he told reporters

'Quite simply, the residents of this area have suffered losses that are not their fault.'

'They are losses that would not have occurred had the right procedures been followed.'

He said there is no reason these residents should sit back and just accept that this fire occurred, and pay for the damages caused.

State of emergency: Two people died in the October 2013 fires which largely affected parts of Springwood and Winmalee in Sydney's Blue Mountains region

Preventable: Residents have taken a power company to court alleging that they failed to trim a tree which may have sparked the Blue Mountains blaze

He said the class action was a secure and low-risk means for the residents and businesses affected by the fire to claim losses that insurance policies did not cover.

'We’ve successfully settled class actions for four different communities that were burnt outduring the Black Saturday bushfires of February 7 2009.'

In all four cases, the fires were the result of poorly-maintained power lines, or surrounding infrastructure, combining with extreme weather conditions to ignite a fire.'

In last year's fires strong winds fueled the blaze with weeks of harrowing conditions adding to its ferocity in the Winmalee and Springwood regions.

There were a number of other, smaller fires which broke out across NSW, but it was the Blue Mountains blaze which caused the most heartache for residents - destroying about 200 homes and damaging a further 200 more.

Residents banded together in the days during and after the blaze to help with the massive cleanup - estimated to cost more than $100 million.

It drew one of the largest firefighting contingents ever to be assembled in NSW, with crews battling  an active 1500-kilometre fire edge at it's peak.

It led Former Premier Barry O'Farrell to declare a state of emergency for the region, and the state's fire boss, Shane Fitzsimmons, called it an unparalleled natural disaster: 'This is unparalleled in terms of fire activity, in terms of damage and destruction, in terms of multi-agency inter-jurisdictional assistance coming to bear so early in the season.'
