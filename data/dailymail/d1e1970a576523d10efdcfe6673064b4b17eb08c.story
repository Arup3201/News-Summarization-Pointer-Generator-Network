A former Navy pilot who crashed into another plane mid-air back in 1974 just revisited the site of his plane's remains after they were found off the coast of Florida.

Bob Besal was a 24-year-old pilot at the time of the crash, and though he ejected safely and was rescued, he never found out what happened to the Vought A-7C he was flying.

Divers from a Jacksonville marine conservation company found portions of the wreck during a dive last month and once they discovered the data plate of the plane.

Back then: Bob Besal was a 24-year-old pilot at the time of the 1974 crash, and though he ejected safely and was rescued, he never found out what happened to the Vought A-7C he was flying

Sea-faring man: In spite of the crash, Mr Besal recently retired from his 30-year-naval career and now works as an aviation maintenance technology teacher in Charleston, South Carolina

When the divers, who work for Think It Sink It Reef It, cleaned off the identifying plate, they were able to trace the wreckage back to the exact plane, crash, and pilot.

After he survived the crash on December 2, 1974, Mr Besal went on to have a successful 30-year naval career and worked up the ranks to the position of rear admiral.

On the morning of the crash, he was up in the air with three other pilots who were practicing for a training mission where they would be involved with bombing runs.

He accidentally clipped the side of one of the other planes when they were 15,000 feet in the air, and he quickly responded by ejecting from the cockpit.

'It's not one of those things you brag about, honestly,' Mr Besal told CNN.

High flyer: Mr Besal took a picture of a plane that was just like his during a flight just months before the crash

Decorated: Mr Besal went on to win two Distinguished Flying Cross awards during his career

Both Mr Besal, who retired from the navy and now works as an aviation maintenance technology teacher in Charleston, South Carolina, and the other pilot survived the crash.

Now, Mr Besal has revisited the site with the diving crew and revisited his past mistake, but the focus was on the positive and not the negative.

'The fact we could determine it was his aircraft and locate Bob and actually bring him out here to visit the reef his wreckage had created, it's actually a very gratifying experience for us,' said Joe  Kistel, the executive director of the diving company.

Discovery: Divers who work for Think It Sink It Reef It found a data plate off the coast of St Augustine, Florida and were able to trace it back to the exact plane, crash, and pilot that landed it there

Happy find: there are no plans to dig up all of the wreckage, but Mr Besal hopes to take home a piece

There are no plans to attempt to dig out the wreckage, which now sits 80-feet below the water in St. Augustine, Florida.

'I'll treasure whatever Joe (Kistel) lets me have just as a keepsake of the event,' Mr Besal told CNN. 

'It will certainly cause me to pause and remember that day and again to remember the incredible squadron mates I had and the people that entrusted me with that airplane. I may have broken that trust with the mishap, but they saw fit to trust me again, that's what I'll remember when I look at those (pieces).'
