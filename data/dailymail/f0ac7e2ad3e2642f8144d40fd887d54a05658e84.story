Kell Brook believes Amir Khan is attempting to skip the queue in the race to fight Floyd Mayweather Jnr.

Khan dominated Devon Alexander in Las Vegas on Saturday night and immediately called out the pound-for-pound No 1.

But his British rival and world champion Brook wants to tempt Khan into a summer blockbuster at Wembley instead.

‘It was a very good performance from Amir,’ he told Sky Sports.

‘He was too quick and too smart for Devon. Devon lost his confidence in the fight and Khan got into a rhythm early on.

‘But I don’t think he deserves that fight [with Mayweather]. I’ve had to go the hard way and force a world title by being mandatory.

Khan never looked in trouble and kept Alexander on the back foot with a punches in bunches

‘He’s had two fights at welterweight and he’s trying to jump the queue.

‘I want to hurt Khan and give the British public the fight they want to see.’

Brook won his world title by beating Shawn Porter in Los Angeles in August but has been out of action since after being stabbed while on holiday in Tenerife.

He is expected to make the first defence of his title in Sheffield on March 7.
