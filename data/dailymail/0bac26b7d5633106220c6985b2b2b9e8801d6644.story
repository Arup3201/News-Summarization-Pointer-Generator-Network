Jailed: Ex-policeman Jon Webb has been sentenced to six years in prison for forgery and theft

A policeman stole £23,000 from a 94-year-old widow and forged her will in an attempt to inherit the bulk of her £400,000 estate.

PC Jonathan Webb was described by colleagues as an ‘utter disgrace to the uniform’ after he was jailed for six years yesterday.

The
South Yorkshire Police officer admitted preying on a trusting  
pensioner, whom he befriended after he was called to her home when she 
had a fall.

He volunteered to visit her in hospital afterwards, and when she had recovered he gained access to her bank accounts.

He
set up internet banking and applied for a cash card so he could 
withdraw money at will, often taking £300 a day.

He even closed down a 
pension account so he could access her life savings, Leeds Crown Court 
heard.

He also typed a 
false will on his  victim’s typewriter, using details from her old will 
to craft a new document making himself the main beneficiary.

Webb,
who has five children from three marriages, was exposed after he came 
under suspicion for another offence, in which he stole £1,000 and 500 US
dollars recovered after a burglary.

Officers
investigating the case found the pensioner’s faked will in the boot of 
his car, and a box of Second World War medals in his locker – the  
product of another theft.

Webb,
45, of Millhouses, Sheffield, resigned in May after 20 years in the 
force. He admitted five charges of theft, five of fraud and one of 
forgery.

Fraudster: Webb took advantage of a 94-year-old woman to steal money from her and alter her will

Sentencing, Judge 
Guy Kearl QC said: ‘You have brought disgrace upon yourself and upon the
police service for whom you served many years and you have undermined 
the public  confidence in our police service.

‘I
am satisfied once you had seen her [the victim] you had selected her as
your prey and then you committed sophisticated and planned acts of 
fraud and theft on a frail and confused elderly lady.’

Alisha Kaye, prosecuting, told the court Webb had visited the pensioner on more than 30 occasions.

The
victim was ‘independent’ and had ‘worked very hard for everything she 
owns’, the court heard. She has no surviving relatives.

Miss
Kaye said: ‘She does not fully understand why the defendant has done 
this to her. It is very hard for her now to trust anyone.

‘The
defendant preyed upon her vulnerability, she trusted him as a friend. 
She trusted the defendant because he was a policeman and said it is his 
job to look after people like her.’

Webb’s
barrister Sam Green said the former officer realised his behaviour was 
‘disgraceful and despicable’, and wished to ‘apologise unreservedly’.
