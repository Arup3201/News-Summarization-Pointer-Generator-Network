Bank of England governor Mark Carney once described the UK as a 'crisis economy' but he is now optimistic about fiscal growth

There is a 50/50 chance that unemployment will fall to the level next year which would trigger a rise in interest rates, the Bank of England has warned.

Governor Mark Carney said the economic recovery has finally taken hold, raising the prospect of a rise in the cost of borrowing.

With the number in work reaching a record high, Mr  Carney said the ‘glass is half full’ as output grows at its fastest pace in six years.

The Canadian, who took up the job in  July and has previously branded the UK a ‘crisis economy’, added: ‘We have one of the strongest recoveries in the advanced world.’

He predicted unemployment is likely to fall by late 2014 to the 7 per cent he has set as a threshold for the Bank to consider raising interest rates.

Analysts quickly suggested rates may go up at the end of next year or in 2015 rather than in late 2016 as the Bank indicated only three months ago.

The prospect led to the London stock market suffering its worst one-day fall for three months with £25billion wiped off the value of blue-chip companies.

Mr Carney said rates will not need to rise if the cost of living remains under control. Inflation fell to 2.2 per cent in October – close to the Bank’s 2 per cent target.

However he also said he was ‘absolutely’ prepared to raise interest rates in the run-up to the general election in 2015 if required.

The Bank said there was a 50-50 chance unemployment will reach 7 per cent in the final three months of 2014.

It
sparked speculation that rates could rise in as little as 12 months in 
what would be a blow to millions of borrowers but ease the pain suffered
by Britain’s army of savers and pensioners.

Mark Harris, chief executive 
of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said: ‘There is now growing 
panic that interest rates might actually rise next year, rather than 
2016 as previously indicated.’

With
investors betting on an early hike, the pound rose sharply but the 
stock market fell with the FTSE 100 index down 96.79 points to 6630.

Mr
Carney insisted the 7 per cent threshold set by the Bank is a  ‘staging
post’ for reassessing interest rates ‘not a trigger for an automatic 
increase’.

The Canadian 
stressed that although the economy is growing again it has not yet 
returned to ‘normality’ – hinting that rates could stay at rock bottom 
well beyond the end of next year.

He
said the Bank will hold rates down for as long as required ‘so that 
British households and businesses have the confidence not just that the 
glass is half full but that it will be filled’.

Mr Carney said: ‘With the recovery taking hold, our task now is to secure it.

‘A strong and sustained recovery is needed to put people back in work.’

Green shoots: The Bank said it expects the economy to grow by 0.9 per cent in the final three months of this year

Publishing its most optimistic set of 
forecasts for years in the latest quarterly inflation report, the Bank 
raised its outlook for growth and jobs and lowered its outlook for 
inflation.

It came as 
figures from the Office for National Statistics showed that employment 
rose by 177,000 between July and September to a record high of 
29.95million;

Hailing
the good news, Mr Carney said: ‘Inflation is now as low as it has been 
since 2009. Jobs are being created at a rate of 60,000 per month.

The improved outlook is a boost to Chancellor George Osborne ahead of next month's autumn statement

'The
economy is growing at its fastest pace for six years. For the first 
time in a long time you don’t have to be an optimist to see the glass is
half full. The recovery has finally taken hold.’

The
Bank said it expects the economy to grow by 0.9 per cent in the final 
three months of this year – building on the 0.8 per cent expansion seen 
in the third quarter and 0.7 per cent in the second.

It raised its growth forecast for 2013 from 1.4 per cent to 1.6 per cent and for 2014 from 2.5 per cent to 2.8 per cent.

Mr
Carney also said inflation – which has been above 2 per cent since the 
end of 2009 – will fall back to target at the start of 2015.

The improved outlook is a boost to George Osborne ahead of next month’s autumn statement.

The
Chancellor said: ‘Unemployment is falling, the economy is growing and 
inflation is down, that shows our economic plan is working and – as the 
governor of the Bank of England says – the recovery is taking hold.’

David Cameron said the good economic news was evidence ‘tough decisions’ had paid off.

But
Labour shadow chancellor Ed Balls said: ‘After three damaging years of 
flatlining these growth forecasts are welcome, but for millions of 
families this is still no recovery at all.’

The economy is still 2.5 per cent smaller than it was before the recession struck and the ONS employment report showed a record 1.46million people are working part time.

The average worker has also seen wages rise by just 0.8 per cent in the past year, well below the rate of inflation, as the squeeze on household finances continues.
