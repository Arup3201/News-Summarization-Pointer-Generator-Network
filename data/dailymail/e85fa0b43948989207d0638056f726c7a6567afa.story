From the outside, the English Martyrs Catholic Church in Goring is as unremarkable as any 1970s suburban building.

Look inside, though, and prepare to be amazed – by the only known reproduction of Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel.

Sign-writer Gary Bevans spent five-and-a-half painstaking years painting the ceiling at the church in West Sussex.

Masterpiece: Sign-painter Gary Bevans, 60, took five-and-a-half years to paint the ceiling of the English Martyrs church in Goring, West Sussex in the style of the Sistine Chapel

The original: Michelangelo took four years to create the artwork on the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican, Rome

Mr Bevans, 60, began his masterpiece after being inspired on a pilgrimage to the Vatican.

His labour of love has now been recognised as a tourist attraction by TripAdvisor and visitors from as far away as Australia have used the travel website to lavish praise on it.

A record number of more than 1,000 guests have entered the church in the past two months.

Mr Bevans started the project in 1987 despite never having an art lesson.

Working by candlelight at night, he fixed
 plywood panels to the ceiling, sketched the figures on to them and then
 painted in the details.

The end product, although 30ft nearer the ground and only 3,500 sq ft to the original’s 5,000 sq ft, remains the only full copy in the world.

Parish secretary Anne Niven said: ‘It never fails to amaze me when people come from all over the world to our little church. It gives us joy to see their faces when they look up at the ceiling.’
