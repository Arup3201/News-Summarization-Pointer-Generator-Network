A mother-of-nine who claims £38,000 a year in handouts and demanded a bigger council house for her huge family is pregnant again - this time with twins.

Cheryl Prudham, 32, and her husband Robert, 29, are set to receive at least a further £1,400 in handouts when the baby girls arrive.

Mrs Prudham said she will 'not be made to feel guilty' for having children' as she and her husband both work part-time.

Mother-of-nine Cheryl Prudham who claims £38,000 a year in handouts and demanded a bigger council house for her huge family is pregnant again - this time with twins

Last year the couple, from Sittingbourne, Kent  - who were living 
in a three-bedroom council house at the time - said they were entitled 
to a bigger house, because they both work part-time.

Eventually the couple were able to arrange a house swap and they moved to a £200,000 property, also in Kent, the Sun reports.

But the expectant mother is still not happy with the swap - organised via Facebook with a family looking to downsize - because she had to move away from her preferred area of Sittingbourne.

She admits her huge brood were not especially planned because she and her husband do not like using contraception.

Speaking after her bid for a new house last year, she said: 'In the past I have been on contraception but I got pregnant with the coil and the pill just doesn't settle well with me.

'We don't use condoms and me and Rob have never talked about it.

'I did rely on benefits before but I am motivated to be more than a mother.'

And she admitted: 'I was surprised by the cost of our kids in the end.'

Cheryl had her first son George, 13, when she was just 17 and was living in a homeless hostel in Kent in the summer of 2000.

She soon moved into a flat with her ex-boyfriend and had second son, Jack, 12, and her eldest daughter Caitlin, eight.

The mother then had three unplanned pregnancies Maisie, seven, Lillie, five, and Madison, four.

The couple are set to receive at least a further £1,400 in handouts when the baby girls arrive. Mrs Prudham said she will 'not be made to feel guilty' for having children' as she and her husband both work part-time

Mrs Prudham revealed that in her old house her children, who are aged between nine months and 13, sit on the floor to eat at meal times because there is not enough space for a dining table.

In March 2009 she met current husband Rob and they had Leon, now three.

They then had Lenny, now two, before completing the family with daughter Lainey in January this year - before she discovered she was pregnant once again with twins.

The couple both recently started working 20 hours per week a week as carers. Neither pays any income tax because their earnings fall below the minimum threshold - earning them just under £1,400 a month.

They then receive £400 child tax credits, topped up by £70 working tax credits, and their £123 a week rent is footed by the council.

They already reportedly receive £7,326 a year in child benefit.
