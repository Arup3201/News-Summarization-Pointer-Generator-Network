A nine-months pregnant mother, raped and killed by a former doctor who met her for sex before administering a lethal heroin injection, had turned to prostitution to make ends meet, a court heard.

Deanna Ballman and her unborn child, planned to be called Mabel, died after the mother answered a Craigslist ad offering $200 to sleep with Ali Salim, according to a prosecutor.

Kyle Rohrer, prosecuting, said the 23-year-old was in a difficult financial situation after moving home to Ohio from Colorado, leaving her husband and trying to support two children while pregnant.

Salim, a former doctor, used Craigslist extensively to meet sexual partners, with many references in his ads to exchanging drugs for sex, including heroin, the filing said.

Many of the women were young, drug-addicted prostitutes, with several alleging they were drugged against their will and others saying they were sexually assaulted, the filing said.

Salim also wrote prescriptions for hard drugs for women with whom he had sexual relationships, and bought heroin that he gave women who visited his house in an upscale neighborhood.

A message was left for Salim's attorney, Sam Shamansky, who previously alleged Ballman was a prostitute feeding a drug habit.

Ballman, 23, died of a fatal heroin overdose, but there is no evidence she was a drug user, Rohrer said.

She was found dead in the back seat of her car on a rural road a few miles from Salim's house the day after she met him.

Rohrer is pushing for a maximum sentence of 37 years at Salim's Dec. 20 sentencing.

Salim,
44, pleaded guilty to two counts of involuntary manslaughter in 
October; he was accused of fatally injecting Ballman with heroin.

He also pleaded guilty to tampering with evidence and abuse of a corpse.

He
entered a type of guilty plea to a charge of rape under which he 
maintains his innocence but acknowledges prosecutors had enough evidence
to convict him.

Thursday's filing disputes Salim's 
version of events the day Ballman died, namely his claim she was alive 
when she left the house and he drove her to a nearby grocery store 
parking lot where he gave her directions to get home. Salim claims he 
then walked home, according to the filing.

But
investigators say video evidence shows Ballman nude and unconscious on 
Salim's bed, apparently suffering distress consistent with a heroin 
overdose, the filing said.

She
didn't leave the house alive, according to the filing, which said Salim
left to get heroin in a neighboring suburb that evening while Ballman 
was still in the house.

Salim 'furnished and administered 
heroin to a young lady who was nine months pregnant, a young lady who, 
by his own admission, declined even a glass of wine' according to the 
filing. 

It notes that 
Salim, an emergency room physician, neglected his duty to help Ballman. 
'Without regard for mother or child, he dumped their bodies in a remote 
location as if he was taking out his trash' the filing said. 

A
second motion Thursday asks Delaware County Judge Duncan Whitney to 
allow investigators to destroy video, photo and audio evidence in the 
case after it's over, saying the material is obscene and shows acts that
Ballman couldn't have consented to because she was unconscious.

'Some of the material further displays extreme and bizarre violence and cruelty' the filing said.
