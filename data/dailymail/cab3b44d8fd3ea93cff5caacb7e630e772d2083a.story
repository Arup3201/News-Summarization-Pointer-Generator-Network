Everton's home clash against Arsenal is the first match of the season involving two teams from the top six. Although Arsenal eventually clinched fourth spot last season, the Gunners will be keen on revenge after suffering a 3-0 humiliation at Goodison Park in April.

Romelu Lukaku, the scorer of two goals against Arsenal in April, is expected to start for Everton today. 

Meanwhile reports that Lukas Podolski will soon move to Juventus have intensified as the Arsenal striker looks set to be left out of the squad for the fixture.

Team news

Everton

Everton midfielder Darron Gibson could be back in contention for Saturday's Barclays Premier League visit of Arsenal after 10 months on the sidelines.

The Irishman, who suffered anterior cruciate ligament damage last October, has steadily built his fitness and is thought to be nearing a return.

Long time coming: Darron Gibson featured for Everton in pre-season and now could make his competitive return from injury against Arsenal having spent 10 months on the sidelines

Right-back Seamus Coleman (hamstring) is also fit after appearing as a late substitute at Leicester last week but striker Arouna Kone (knee) and midfielder Bryan Oviedo (leg) are not yet ready and midfielder Ross Barkley (knee) faces a lengthy lay-off.

Provisional squad: Howard, Coleman, Distin, Jagielka, Baines, Barry, McCarthy, Osman, Pienaar, Lukaku, Robles, Hibbert, Stones, Alcaraz, Gibson, Besic, McGeady, Naismith, Mirallas, Atsu.

Arsenal 

Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta will miss the trip to former club Everton on Saturday because of an ankle problem.

World Cup winners Per Mertesacker, Lukas Podolski and Mesut Ozil could return to the squad after being given extra time off, as could forward Yaya Sanogo (hamstring) who did not travel in the midweek Champions League play-off away to Besiktas.

Down and out: Mikel Arteta limped off in Arsenal's mid-week draw at Besiktas in the Champions League

Full-back Kieran Gibbs (hamstring) remains sidelined, while midfielders Theo Walcott and Serge Gnabry continue their recovery from knee problems and will not feature in the Barclays Premier League contest.

Provisional squad: Szczesny, Debuchy, Chambers, Koscielny, Monreal, Flamini, Wilshere, Ramsey, Sanchez, Cazorla, Giroud, Martinez, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Campbell, Miquel, Rosicky, Bellerin, Diaby, Sanogo, Mertesacker, Podolski, Ozil.

Key match stats (supplied by Opta)

Everton’s victory against Arsenal in April ended a run of 13 without one against the Gunners in the Premier League.

Arsenal are the only away team to score six goals in a Premier League game at Goodison Park (in August 2009).

Steven Naismith has scored four and assisted two in his last nine Premier League appearances.

Arsenal have now gone four games without a win against Everton, their worst such run in the Premier League.

Case for the defence: Arsenal last beat Everton in the Premier League when Thomas Vermaelen (second right) struck after just eight minutes to seal a 1-0 win for the Gunners at Goodison Park in March 2012

The Gunners have never gone five league games without beating the Toffees in their history.

Arsenal have not won their opening two league games since 2009 (which included a win against Everton).

Last season Everton opened the season with two draws; they drew their opener last week at Leicester.

Everton have scored at least two goals in each of their last six Premier League home games.

But two of the Toffees’ last three Premier League home games have seen them lose 3-2.

Arsenal won more away games than any other Premier League team in 2013-14 (11), yet ended the season with a goal difference of only +2 on the road.
