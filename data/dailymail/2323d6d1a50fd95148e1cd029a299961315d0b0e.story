A jobless mother appeared on national television yesterday and insisted that she 'didn't beg' for a £400,000 council home built for her and her 11 children and paid for by the taxpayers.

Unemployed Heather Frost, 37, of Churchdown, Gloucestershire,  was on ITV's Daybreak where she defended the purpose-built eco-home but said she was only '50/50 whether I’m going to take it'.

MailOnline had earlier revealed that the family own a horse, despite Ms Frost claiming benefits for her 11 children. Yesterday 16-year-old Angel defended her mother saying that it is she who pays for the upkeep of the £200-a-month horse named Annie, but failed to explain where she gets the money.

Defence: Miss Frost told ITV's Daybreak that she 'didn't beg' for the £400,000 home and is '50/50 whether I'm going to take it' because of the 'hassle' she was getting

Miss Frost said that she does not 
want two of the children's three fathers to make a contribution to her 
finances and would 'love' to support her brood herself but does not need to because 'there is 
help out there'.

She told ITV's Daybreak:
 'I'm grateful to the council for giving me the two houses in the first 
place. We moved into one property with the next property becoming 
available soon.

'Size-wise it's fine, but it's a 
hassle having to house so many children in one house and so many in the 
other. I didn't beg or go and put a gun to someone's head to get some 
help.

'I'd love to go out and work. I took a
 business plan two years ago to open my own shop and do my own business,
 but I fell ill. I'd love to support my children myself, but there is 
help out there.

'I was booked in to be sterilised, 
but then I got cancer and it stopped everything. I haven’t said that if 
the house is too small for me, they could just build me another one. I 
didn't beg for this house.

'With the hassle I'm getting at the 
moment, I’m 50/50 whether I’m going to take it. Everyone knows where it 
is now, and I’m not moving in there and then my kids being picked on – 
the hassle.’

Her daugther's grey mare Annie
 lives in a field around a mile from the current Frost family home, with
 the paddock fees, food and vet bills for the horse estimated to total 
around £200 per month.

A worker at the paddock claimed Miss 
Frost had recently arranged to buy two more horses but the deal fell 
through at the last minute.

She
 is understood to pay £65 a month in paddock fees and had negotiated a 
deal last month where she could stable a total of three horses for £175.

The
 worker said Miss Frost bought Annie ‘about eight months ago’, adding: 
‘Horses are expensive. I know, I’ve had them all my life.

‘Annie has breathing difficulties, so the vet has to come out quite often. They must spend at least £200 a month on her.

'They were going to buy two more horses 
recently, but that deal fell through. It’s sickening to think that she 
can afford what most people would consider a luxury at the expense of 
the British taxpayer.’

Miss Frost refused to discuss the horse on Tuesday – but on Daybreak yesterday, her daughter said her mother doesn't make any contribution to the animal.

Angel also took to a local website on Tuesday to defend her mother after it was revealed the family were 
being handed a six-bedroom, three-bathroom newly built home.

'The horse is mine - I got given it by a friend. I pay for it, I pay rent, I pay bills, my mum doesn't pay anything at all'

She wrote: 
‘My mum has nothing to be ashamed about.’

Angel told Daybreak: 'The horse is mine - I got given it by a friend. I pay for it, I pay rent, I pay bills, my mum doesn't pay anything at all. My mum is a very strong lady and she'll get over it (the hassle).’

But at the family’s current home which comprises two terraced houses with a connecting door, her mother said on Tuesday: ‘I will not talk about my horse or my kids.’

She lives with her children  Sophie, 22, 
Toby, 19, Daisy, 18, Angel, 16, Jay, 14, Chloe, 13, Paige, 12, Emily, 
ten, Beth, nine, Ruby, seven and Tilly, two.

Deal: Tewkesbury Borough Council bosses have sold a plot of land in Northway Lane, Tewkesbury, for around £210,000. In return, the housing provider is building the six-bed super-house along with 12 other homes

Grand designs: The plans for the family's plush new eco-home which the council has agreed to build

But her local council has arranged for a 1,850sq ft property to be built on a new housing development in Tewkesbury, Gloucestershire, which is due for completion in June. The eco-home features the latest in energy-saving design.

Frost also lives with partner Jake, who the neighbours say works as a lorry driver, Sophie’s two-year-old daughter Ashley, and Toby’s son Tyler.

The family’s neighbours were outraged on Tuesday by the revelation that Miss Frost has enough cash to keep a horse.

One said: ‘It’s disgusting. Owning a horse should be a luxury reserved for people who work and can pay for it themselves.

‘I don’t pay my taxes so some jobless baby machine can have a horse.’

A commentator using the name ‘Charlie76’ wrote on a Gloucestershire news website: ‘What an absolute joke! How can she afford horses? I can barely afford my dog and I work and have kids. Bloody disgraceful!’

Robert Oxley, from the TaxPayers' Alliance, criticised the decision to build the family a new home.

'It's scandalous that so much time and taxpayers' money is being spent on one custom built mansion,' he said. 'Many people can't afford to buy their own home but have to opt for what their budget allows.

'Benefits are there to help those who need support, not subsidise a lifestyle that most people paying for them could not afford themselves.'

Miss Frost’s daughter Angel defended her mother on a local news website.

Spacious: The house comes with six bedrooms, two living rooms, a kitchen/ diner and two bathrooms

Money-saver: The new house will boast an energy efficient design to help keep Heather's energy bills down

Controversial: Councillor Derek Davies said it was a 'great example' of how the council works with housing providers to ensure affordable housing is provided for all our residents' housing needs

Using the name ‘AngelFrost’, she wrote: ‘Heather is my mum, she doesn’t work, but my father did, and he left, so why are you blaming my mother?

‘How could she possibly work with 11 children, you people have no right judging us. My mum has nothing to be ashamed about, the house we are mooving (sic) to in is smaller then the one we live in now, so its far from a mansion.

‘All us kids are as happy as could be, full of joy and full  of life, and as for thinking we are all going to be following in her foot steps (sic) you can think again.’

She said she was proud of her mother and blamed her absent father for failing to support the family.

Miss Frost (pictured with one of her sons) first fell pregnant at just 14, to a 23-year-old boyfriend who ended up in prison, and has gone on to have ten more children

What a state: Miss Frost's current home in Gloucestershire is blighted by a bashed-up minibus, car and a skip

Councillor Derek Davies, lead member for built environment at Tewkesbury Borough Council, said: 'We have a duty to provide appropriate accommodation to people who are at risk of homelessness.

'Ms Frost's family has been living in temporary accommodation, consisting of two houses, for a very long time because there have been no other suitable properties available.

'This is an excellent example of the council working in partnership with registered providers, using public land to develop more affordable housing in line with government policy.

'We were able to sell land owned by the borough council to Severn Vale for them to develop 13 affordable homes, including this unit to meet the particular needs of Ms Frost and her family.

'By providing this larger affordable property, the two houses currently occupied by the family will be available for other families in need.'
