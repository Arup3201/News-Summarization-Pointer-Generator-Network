Fastfood giant KFC has suspended a member of staff who claimed an order was laced with pubic hair.

The worker at the restaurant in Gabalfa, Cardiff, said the alleged move was an act of revenge after customers told her friend to 'smile more'.

However, bosses claim it could not have happened because there were four other people in the kitchen - 'which is pretty cosy'.

A worker at KFC in Gabalfa, Cardiff has been suspended after claiming order was laced with pubic hair

Details of the alleged incident were published in an anonymous post on the 'Spotted Cardiff' Facebook page, designed as an outlet for 'rants' about the Welsh capital.

The staff member wrote that the victims of the prank, a group of girls, drove through KFC between 1pm and 1.30pm yesterday.

The post said: 'Karma's a **** girls, hope you enjoyed your food I made for you after overhearing the way you spoke to my girl on the head set be picking pubes out your teeth for a week' (sic).

It was then signed off with 'mwah', a word used to express the sound of a kiss.

However, a spokesman for KFC said the worker - who is suspended indefinitely - has now admitted it didn't happen after being interviewed by the 'area coach'.

The spokesman conceded that there was an 'altercation' at the drive-thru but maintain that no food was contaminated - adding that two other workers have since been interviewed and insist it could not be true.

'We were already pretty confident that it didn't happen. The post was put up and then everyone that was there was interviewed by the area coach,' she said.

'It takes a few people to make a meal and the other workers say there is no way she could have done it.

'Two other people are pretty confident that it didn't happen.

The message, which was posted on Facebook page Spotted Cardiff, 
suggested the worker had carried out the alleged act in an apparent 
revenge attack for rudeness - but KFC now claims she made it up

'She has admitted it was a spur of the moment prank to draw attention to the people that were being rude.'

The
 chain said in a statement: 'We have thoroughly investigated this 
incident and can confirm that the content of the post is untrue and that
 the food was not contaminated in any way.

'It
 was a badly misjudged and regrettable social media prank and we'd like 
to reassure customers that the incident did not happen.'

Earlier today the spokesman said: 'We have investigated this incident and although there was an altercation in the drive-thru between the customers and a member of our team, we do not believe the food was contaminated in any way.

'We have the highest standards of food hygiene and do not tolerate even the suggestion of this kind of behaviour, and therefore the employee was suspended as soon as the matter came to our attention.'
