A two-alarm fire sparked by a lightning strike Tuesday ravaged an apartment complex in Celebration, Florida, forcing a cat to jump from a third-story window.

Josue Alicea's pet named Charlie Jasper was caught on camera standing on a window sill before trying to make her way down the sheer wall.

Having failed that, the one-year-old cat took a leap. She landed on the cement floor and took off running.

Leap of faith: A video camera caught the moment a cat jumped out of a third-floor window to escape a two-alarm apartment building fire in Celebration, Florida

Nine lives: The animal landed on the cement floor and ran away before a first responder caught up with her and put an oxygen mask on her face

‘It didn’t bounce or anything,’ fire victim Jim Cooke told the station WFTV of his neighbor’s pet.

Eyewitnesses said Charlie Jasper was given an oxygen mask by responding firefighters, who spotted the cat a short distance away.

Charlie Jasper was said to be purring when a first responder picked her up and handed the feline back to Alicea. 

According to her owner, the kitty escaped with burnt paws, a broken jaw and a few minor scrapes, the channel WKMG reported.

Charlie Jasper is naturally grey, but in the video showing her daring escape the kitty appears jet-black from soot.

Officials said a lightning bolt struck the attic of the 24-unit Evander Sqaure Apartments complex on Latte Drive at around 3pm Tuesday during a massive storm that rolled through the area.

Irreparable damage: The two-alarm fire ravaged the wooden building, the interior of which collapsed down to the first floor

About 20 minutes later a fire ignited, with 50mph gusts of wind spreading the flames, which quickly engulfed the whole interior of the wooden three-story building.

All the tenants escaped the inferno unharmed. Like many of the residents, the cat's owner, Alicea, was at work when the fire sparked.

It took Osceola County firefighters two hours to extinguish the blaze, but not before the roof collapsed all the way down to the first floor.

Outcome: It took firefighters two hours to put out the flames, but despite their best efforts, all 24 families residing in the complex were left homeless

‘Everything internal has collapsed to the bottom floor. I don't see a whole lot of salvageable things here,’ Deputy Fire Chief Danny McAvoy told WESH-TV.

The tenants had moved into the building only five months ago. Now, most of them have been left with nothing.

The American Red Cross is helping the 24 families who have been displaced by the fire.
