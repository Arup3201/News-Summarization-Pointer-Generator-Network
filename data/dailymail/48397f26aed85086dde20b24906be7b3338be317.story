His booming voice has been heard by thousands of visitors to a market town in North Yorkshire for the last six years.

So it is perhaps a little fitting that a town crier who was sacked for allegedly boozing while on duty has refused to go quietly.

Kevin Griffiths was shown the door after he called a councillor 'an idiot' and was accused of going drinking in Skipton's pubs dressed in full official regalia.

Refusing to go quietly: Town crier Kevin Griffiths has vowed to carry on bell-ringing - despite his licence being revoked by the council

However the 58-year-old has refused to be silenced, instead going 'rogue' and vowing to carry on bell-ringing - despite his licence being revoked by Skipton Town Council.

He is now seeking alternative backing - from Skipton Castle as Lord of the Manor or one of the local churches who can appoint their own bellmen.

Failing that, he says he will act in his other capacity as town crier for Bradford.

He said: 'If necessary, I will act as an independent crier and will fight for my rights in court.'

However, the town council’s withdrawal of support does mean he will not defend his position as National Champion at Hastings in two weeks’ time.

Mr Griffiths, who has been Skipton's town crier since 2006, added: 'The town council used to give me £500 in expenses and I used that to cover the costs. Without it, I can’t compete.'

Familiar face... and voice: Mr Griffiths has been a town crier in Skipton since 2006

He described the town council’s decision as totally and utterly ridiculous and claimed he was the victim of a personal vendetta.

He said: 'All the people in the town are behind me; it’s just the council. They have got rid of me for doing my job.'

At issue has been his use of Craven District Council’s town centre car park, where he meets coaches and advises visitors where they can get refreshments.

It is claimed it is a breach of bylaws which prevent commercial activity on council land.

The matter was discussed by the town council behind closed doors on Thursday.

The authority acted after 'numerous complaints, over a lengthy period of time' relating to Mr Griffiths’ behaviour, a spokesman.

Complaints centred on claims that he had promoted local businesses while standing in a council car park, a breach of a local byelaw.

He also got into trouble for calling a councillor an 'idiot' during an argument, which he had admitted.

Councillors also looked into allegations that Mr Griffiths had been drinking while dressed for the role.

Mr Griffiths, a former fireman, said he had not been treated fairly because the allegations about drinking had not been put to him.

He said: 'The meetings have been held behind closed doors and these allegations (about drinking) are the first I have heard. How can I defend against that?'

Mr Griffiths said he would sometimes have 'four or five pints' in the pub but only after his town crier shift had ended, adding: 'I am conscious of the fact that I am wearing the livery and I would not get smashed out of my skull be-cause it’s an insult to the Queen.'

Silenced for good? The rogue crier said he would sometimes have 'four or five pints' in the pub but only after his shift had ended

He said he was self-employed and therefore not 'on duty' when he was in the pub.

He believes businesses complained about him promoting one establishment over another but he denied any bias.

A
council statement said: 'Skipton Town Council has withdrawn its 
permission for Mr Kevin Reid Griffiths to act in the capacity of town 
crier to the parish of Skipton.

'The council has been in receipt of numerous complaints, over a lengthy period of time, relating to activities being undertaken by Mr Griffiths while acting as town crier.

'The quantity of complaints received, together with the repeated refusal to adhere to the reasonable requests and instructions of the council, and a failure to follow the rules of membership of the Ancient and Honourable Guild of Town Criers has made the position untenable.

'The position of town crier to Skipton is an honorary position in the gift of Skipton Town Council.

'At a meeting of the full council, held on September 20, members discussed the situation in full, including the complaints received by the council and the responses from Mr Griffiths to requests made previously by the council in an attempt to find a constructive way forward.

'The decision of members was to revoke the town council’s consent for Mr Griffiths to act as Skipton Town Crier, with immediate effect.'
