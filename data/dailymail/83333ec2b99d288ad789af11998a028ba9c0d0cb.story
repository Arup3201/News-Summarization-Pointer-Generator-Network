Two councillors are locked in a libel court battle after one of them circulated a leaflet depicting his rival as Del Boy from Only Fools and Horses star.

Plaid Cymru's Neil McEvoy, a former deputy leader of Cardiff City Council, claims the leaflet implied that he was 'not to be trusted'.

However, Labour councillor Michael Michael, who distributed the image, insists that it was not meant to be taken literally.

The leaflet, which shows a cartoon of Del Boy superimposed with Mr McEvoy's face, was distributed in the Fairwater area of the Welsh capital.

It carried a message saying it was 'printed and promoted' by Mr Michael, chair of the council's planning committee.

Mr McEvoy is now suing Mr Michael, arguing that it is defamatory to refer to a public figure as 'Del Boy'.

Barristers for the two rival councillors put forward legal arguments at a High Court hearing in Cardiff this week.

David Hughes, for Mr McEvoy, said: 'We all know who Del Boy is. He's not to be trusted. He's a rogue. Which of us would like to be compared to Del Boy?'

But Hugh Tomlinson QC, for Mr Michael, said: 'The comparison between Del Boy and the claimant wouldn't be taken literally by readers of the leaflet.

'Suggesting that Councillor McEvoy is like Del Boy Trotter because he is a roguish character and a fantasist is obviously a comment rather than a statement of fact and can't be read in any other way.'

The lawyer added that he was 'in a minority of one' because he had never watched Only Fools and Horses and did not previously know who Del Boy was.

The leaflet was approved by local Assembly Member Mark Drakeford, Wales's health minister, the court heard.

Judge Andrew Keyser QC reserved judgement in the case.

Del Boy, played by David Jason in the long-running BBC comedy, was portrayed as a chancer with a love of get-rich-quick schemes.
