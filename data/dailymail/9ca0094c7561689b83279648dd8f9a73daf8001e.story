A stoppage-time winner from Moussa Sow saw Senegal complete an impressive comeback against Ghana, the striker netting with the last kick of the game to secure a 2-1 win.

Sow, preferred off the bench to Newcastle’s Papiss Cisse, was in the right place at the right time to grab a back-post winner with seconds left on the clock.

Before the dramatic ending it had been Premier League stars who had taken centre stage as two of Africa’s most star-studded sides played out an entertaining game in Mongomo.

Mame Biram Diouf of Stoke City bagged the equaliser for Senegal after Ghana had taken a first half lead through a penalty won by Everton’s Christian Atsu.

Diouf, lively throughout, was the quickest to react when his own header came back off the post in the 57th minute, nodding the rebound home from close range.

In truth, the pacey striker could have had more than just one goal. In the first half Diouf saw a spectacular bicycle kick saved by Ghana keeper Razak Brimah, denying him what would have been an early contender for goal of the season. Then, just minutes after his equaliser, he spurned a simple chance, swinging wildly at a cross with his left foot, but sending high over the bar from close range.

In the tournament’s ‘Group of Death’ neither side could afford a defeat in the first game, and both seemed set up to avoid conceding, rather than chase the win, in the opening stages. Senegal in particular were keen to sit back and use the pace of Stoke’s Diouf on the break.

But Andre Ayew’s 12th minute penalty changed all that. It was won by Atsu, the winger on loan from Chelsea, showing pace to get to Emmanuel Badu-Agyemang’s through ball ahead of Senegal keeper Bouna Coundoul, who brought him down.

Ayew, captaining Ghana in the absence of Asamoah Gyan – missing with Malaria - chipped home down the middle and ran straight to the dugout to celebrate with his team-mates.

The goal meant Senegal had to come out of their shell, leaving space for Atsu and both Ayews to attack. It was Jordan Ayew who had the most joy, at one point feeding Atsu after a driving run, only for the winger to curl his shot just wide.

But Alain Giresse’s Senegal side, though not particularly pretty, did look a threat - particularly at set pieces.

Centre-back Serigne Mbodji powered a header against the crossbar before Diouf forced a save from Brimah with a spectacular bicycle kick.

Neither side were helped by a shocking pitch, the second the competition has seen in two days. A bobble denied Senegal’s Stephane Badji an early opportunity, before late on in the first half Coundoul was lucky to make contact with a horribly bobbling back-pass, which he managed to slice away for a corner.

But there was still plenty to admire about the jungle stadium in the remote city of Mongomo, which was packed full of noisy and colourfully dressed fans.

In the second half they witnessed a Senegal onslaught, as Avram Grant’s side sat back on their lead.

But Ghana never looked comfortable in defence, and Diouf’s goal, when it came, was no surprise.

Both sides had chances in the closing stages, Pape Kouly Diop charging through a non-existent Ghana defence before dragging his shot wide from just inside the box, before Jordan Ayew put a header wide from seven yards out.

But, it looked as though both would have to settle for a point until dramatic Sow’s last-gasp winner.
