Banish the bucket, sponge and hose.

Japanese giant Nissan has developed the world’s first  ‘self-cleaning car’ which it predicts will make car-washing ‘obsolete.’

Its UK engineers are testing innovative ‘nano-paint technology’ which repels dirt before it gets a chance to take hold on the paintwork.

For drivers who would rather run a mile than wipe down their dirty vehicles with a sponge or wince at the high cost of a car-wash, it means salvation may soon be at hand.

It is set to be an option on future models but is being tested in Britain on the new Sunderland-built Nissan Note which went on sale in October priced from £12,100 to £17,100.

No price has yet been set but it is likely to be around £450 ($750) – or similar to a metallic paint option.

A Nissan spokesman said: ‘The Nissan Note is first car to trial paint which could make car washes obsolete.

‘Washing a car can be a chore - and a costly one at that. In response, Nissan has begun tests on innovative paint technology that repels mud, rain and everyday dirt, meaning drivers may never have to clean their car again.’

Scientists have developed ‘super-hydrophobic’ and ‘oleophobic’ paint, which repels water and oils. It has been applied to the all-new Nissan Note supermini  to create what it calls ‘the world's first self-cleaning car’.

Nissan says it is the first to apply the trade-marked technology called Ultra-Ever Dry on automotive bodywork

A Nissan spokesman said: 'By creating a protective layer of air between the paint and environment, it effectively stops standing water and road spray from creating dirty marks on the car's surface'

Nissan says it is the first carmaker to apply the trade-marked technology called Ultra-Ever Dry® on automotive bodywork and will be testing it ‘in the real world’ over the coming months at its European Technical Centre at Cranfield in Bedfordshire.

Explaining how the dirt-repellent coating works, a Nissan spokesman said: ‘By creating a protective layer of air between the paint and environment, it effectively stops standing water and road spray from creating dirty marks on the car's surface.’

The Note already features a ‘wash and blow dry' function on its rear view camera. This uses water and compressed air to automatically keep the lens free of dirt and ensure the Notes' safety sensors work in all conditions.

A spokesman said: ‘So far, the coating has responded well to common use cases including rain, spray, frost, sleet and standing water.’

Chief marketing manager Geraldine Ingham said; ‘The Nissan Note has been carefully engineered to take the stress out of customer driving and Nissan's engineers are constantly thinking of new ways to make families' lives easier.

‘We are committed to addressing everyday problems our customers face and will always consider testing exciting, cutting edge technology like this incredible coating application.’

Nissan employs 8,500 people in Britain, including 7,300 at the Sunderland factory, 950 at the Cranfield Technical Centre and 50 at Nissan’s European design centre at Paddington in London.
