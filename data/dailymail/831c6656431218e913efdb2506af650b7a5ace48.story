As the search for missing AirAsia flight QZ8501 resumed on Monday morning Australia's Foreign Minister Julie Bishop pessimistically admitted that 'our worst fears may be confirmed', however the government has sent help anyway.

The Foreign Minister admitted that hope that the saga would reach a happy conclusion was fading fast with each passing hour. But despite this, the Australian Defence Force (ADF) deployed a Royal Australian Air Force AP-3C Orion maritime patrol aircraft from Darwin to assist in the search on Monday morning.

'Whilst we hope for the best, as time goes on I’m afraid our worst fears may be confirmed,' Ms Bishop warned.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has told the Indonesian president that Australia has an aircraft ready to go and will do whatever is possible to help with the search for missing Air Asia flight QZ8501

Defence Force boss, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin, said the ADF was still willing to help in the search for Air Asia flight QZ8501, and that the Orion aircraft was perfect for the job.

'The Orion aircraft has a well proven capability in search and rescue and carries maritime search radar coupled with infra-red and electro-optical sensors to support the visual observation capabilities provided by its highly trained crew members,' Air Chief Marshal Binskin said.

Ms Bishop emphasised that discussions are continuing with her government and Indonesian authorities to confirm if there were any Australian dual nationals on the missing AirAsia flight.

The plane was carrying 162 people when it went missing in bad weather on its way from Indonesia to Singapore, and Ms Bishop told The Today Show that the nationalities of the passengers involved were still being double checked.

'We understand there are no Australian citizens on board. We are looking for details of any potential dual nationals or permanent residencies or any linkages with Australia. At this stage we don't have those details but we are accessing the manifest from authorities,' Ms Bishop said.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has already pledged Australia's support and has called Indonesian president Joko Widodo to offer assistance.

Mr Abbott told the Indonesian president Australia would do whatever 'we humanly could' to help.

Ms Bishop also said she had spoken to Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi and expressed similar sentiments in support and assistance for Indonesia in any way.

'I know Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi from MH17 days, because she was Indonesian's Ambassador to the Netherlands when Indonesia lost 12 people on board MH17,' she explained. 

A massive search and rescue operation began for the plane with fishing boats and official vessels being sent out by Indonesia's national search and rescue authority.

Helicopters and Hercules aircraft from Singapore were also sent out to search for the plane, with efforts focusing around the area of the Java Sea near Belitung. 

However the efforts have been halted until sunrise due to poor visibility.  

Mr Abbott said he was sorry to hear about the tragedy, especially the many families who would be left bereft by the loss.

Ms Bishop earlier said she called her counterparts in Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and South Korea, all of whom have citizens aboard the aeroplane.

'Our thoughts and prayers are with their families,' Ms Bishop said.

'We hope and pray there will be survivors.' 

Devastated AirAsia CEO Tony Fernandes also could only hope for the best.

'We are very devastated by what’s happened, it’s unbelievable,' he said in a media address in Surabaya.

'Our concern right now is for the relatives and for the next of kin - there is nothing more important to us, for our crew’s family, and for the passengers’ families.'

The Australian embassy in Jakarta and the Australian High Commission in Singapore have been making inquiries with local authorities.

Air traffic controllers lost contact with the Airbus A320-200 about an hour after it left Juanda international airport in Surabaya, east Java, at 5.20am local time.

It was scheduled to arrive in Singapore at 8.30am.

Shortly before disappearing, the plane asked permission from Jakarta air traffic control to track away from its flight plan and climb above adverse weather in an area renowned for severe thunderstorms.

The pilots requested 'deviation due to en route weather before communication with the aircraft was lost while it was still under the control of the Indonesian Air Traffic Control (ATC)', AirAsia said in a statement on its Facebook page.

It's the third major incident to affect a Malaysian carrier this year.

AirAsia issued a passenger list indicating there were no Australians on the flight, but Ms Bishop said she had sought information on whether there were any dual citizens or Australian residents.

AirAsia said the plane was carrying 155 passengers as well as two pilots, four flight attendants and an engineer on the flight.

As well as the 155 Indonesian passengers there were three South Koreans, one Malaysian, one British and one Singaporean, according to AirAsia's statement on Sunday night. 

One French national has also been identified as part of the crew.

The breakdown of passengers is 138 adults, 16 children and a baby, said Indonesia's air transportation director general Djoko Murjatmodjo.
