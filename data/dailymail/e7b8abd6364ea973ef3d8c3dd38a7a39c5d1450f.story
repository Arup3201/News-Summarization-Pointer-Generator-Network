A female anteater left zoologists at a Connecticut conservation center baffled after unexpectedly giving birth more than a year and a half after being separated from her mate.

Officials at the LEO Zoological Conservation Center said they had removed the only male anteater from the enclosure in August, long before the six-month gestation period for baby Archie would have begun.

However, the mystery of how Armani the anteater eventually  conceived has finally been revealed as  'embryonic diapause' .

It's not virgin birth in the strict sense of 
the phrase, however embryonic diapause happens when a mother puts a fertilized 
egg on hold in her uterus.

How did Archie come into being? Embryonic diapause - not virgin birth in the strict sense of the phrase, but embryonic diapause happens when a mother puts a fertilized egg on hold in her uterus

If environmental conditions aren’t right, the mother can prevent the fertilized egg from implanting and developing for long periods of time.

The process has never been observed in an anteater, however it has been documented in armadillos.

Whilst zookeepers may not have witnessed Armani with her male companion, Alf, at some point they actually were together.

Some scientific papers have mentioned
 the scenario in which an animal's body pauses a pregnancy until 
environmental conditions are right.

‘When she gives birth, her entire 
uterus is going to clear out,’ Stacey Belhumeur, species survival plan 
coordinator for the North American population of giant anteaters, told 
the Greenwich Time. ‘Anything that's in her uterus, even another undeveloped embryo, would clear out.’

For weeks there had been theories as to how Armani became pregnant.

Some had suggested parthenogenesis, or for want of a better term, a virgin birth.

During such cases, the embryo grows and 
develops in the absence of fertilization.

It sounds unusual—some might 
even say miraculous—but it’s a surprisingly common occurrence in the 
animal kingdom.

Researchers believe that an absence of available males likely drives the phenomenon.

Although
 the exact mechanisms of parthenogenetic reproduction can vary from 
species to species, all parthenogenesis produces normal, healthy 
offspring.

Armani the anteater hadn't been with her mate in the months before she conceived

When Archie was born, it gave the impression of immaculate conception
