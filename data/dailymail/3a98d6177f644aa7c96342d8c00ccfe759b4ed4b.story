British forces have been rehearsing surprise airborne assaults which could be used to rescue British hostages from their Islamic State captors.

Troops were seen rappelling quickly from helicopters as others parachuted from planes five miles off the coast of RAF Valley in Anglesey, Wales.

The training missions honed techniques which could be used by elite troops in a shock attack on Islamic State extremists.

Manchester taxi-driver-turned-aid worker Alan Henning, 47, has been held by IS since last December and earlier this month, they threatened to kill him in the same video which showed the beheading of fellow Briton David Haines.

Another British hostage, the journalist John Cantlie, has now been held by IS since November 2012, and last month appeared on a YouTube video.

In the two-week long training exercise launched from RAF Valley – where Prince William served as a search and rescue pilot – various scenarios were rehearsed to prepare troops for whatever might lie ahead.

In one, troops leapt out of RAF Lynx and Merlin helicopters, zipping down ropes in a mock offensive. They were also spotted in a daring manoeuvre launching fast boats from the back of a Chinook helicopter which was flown just inches above the water at breath-taking speed.

Servicemen were also seen leaping from two RAF Hercules transport planes during the exercise, which saw various routines carried out late in the evening until around midnight.

A hostage rescue mission in hostile territory would be one of the most hazardous missions imaginable. 

In 1979, a top-secret attempt by US special forces to free American hostages held in Tehran, Iran, ended in disaster with the death of eight soldiers when two of the aircraft involved – a helicopter and a Hercules – collided and were engulfed in flames.

The British Government has ruled out deploying ground troops against IS militants as the RAF joined air strikes against the extremists in Iraq yesterday.

But that hasn’t stopped military commanders ensuring UK troops are at maximum readiness to strike in a targeted assault. 

Security services have identified six plots involving jihadi fanatics who have returned from Syria to launch attacks in Europe.

One involved a gun and bomb attack in London which was to be carried out on the orders of a terrorist mastermind in the Middle East.

As reported in The Mail on Sunday earlier this year, counter-terrorism officers working with MI5 detained a man who had returned to London from Syria with substantial amounts of cash which he used to buy weapons and bomb-making equipment.

The suspect joined up with another extremist, and security officials arrested them at gunpoint.

David Cameron warned of the six thwarted plots during the parliamentary debate on whether to take military action in Iraq against ISIS

The other plots were uncovered in France, Italy and the Netherlands, but the men were not charged with terrorism offences, security sources said.

David Cameron referred to the six plots during the parliamentary debate on whether to take military action in Iraq against Islamic State.

He said: ‘This international operation is about protecting our people too, and protecting the streets of Britain should not be a task that we are prepared to entirely subcontract to other air forces of other countries. This is not a threat on the far side of the world.’

One plot was not disrupted. In May, Mehdi Nemmouche, 29, who had fought with IS in Syria, was arrested after three people were shot and killed in a Jewish museum in Brussels.
