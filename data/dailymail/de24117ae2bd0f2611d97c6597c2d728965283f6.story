Evidence from Colorado gunman James Holmes' cellphone - including eerie selfies he took just hours before the shooting spree - can be used by the prosecution, a judge has ruled.

The images were taken by Holmes before he allegedly opened fire on a movie theater in Aurora, Colorado during a screening of the Dark Knight in 2012, killing 12 people and injuring 70 more.

Among the photos, which have only been shown in court, is one of Holmes wearing black contact lenses and a black stocking cap, with two tufts of his orange-dyed hair sticking out like horns.

In another, he held a pistol beneath his 
face and grinned at the lens. A third showed an assault rifle and 
shotgun, magazines for ammunition, tactical gear and bags to carry 
rounds arrayed on a bed.

Locked up: James Holmes, who killed 12 people and injured 70 others in shooting in Aurora, Colorado in July 2012 took eerie selfies in the hours before the massacre. A judge ruled these can be used prosecutors

Police have testified the photos were 
taken about six hours before the July 20, 2012, shootings.

Investigators said they also found pictures on his iPhone of movie theater doors taken up to three weeks before the attack, as part of his possible planning, the Denver Post reported.

The ruling, which was made public on Monday, also allows for evidence found in Holmes' iPod, computers, emails and bank records to be used by prosecutors.

Defense attorneys had argued the 
warrant used to seize the phone was over-broad and unconstitutional 
because it failed to be specific enough.

Allowed in court: In another image, he held a pistol beneath his face as he looked at the camera

But the judge disagreed and rejected eight defense motions to suppress the evidence.

'[N]o date range could have been justified,' Arapahoe County District Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. wrote in the ruling.

'Officers
 realized that these were no impromptu crimes; extensive planning and 
preparation had obviously gone into the shooting and the booby-trapping 
of the apartment.

'But they 
had no way of knowing whether it had taken months, a year, two years, or
 longer to complete such planning and preparation.'

Holmes, a 26-year-old former 
neuroscience graduate student, pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity 
to more than 160 counts of murder and attempted murder.

His
 attorneys have acknowledged he was the shooter but said he was in the 
grip of a psychotic episode. The case now hinges on whether he was 
insane.

Selfies: These images - which are not part of the contested evidence - were shared on a website, Adult Friend Finder, ahead of the attack that claimed the lives of 12 people and injured 70 others

Scene: Prosecutors are also permitted to use evidence found on his computer, which was found during a search of his apartment (above). The defense had claimed the evidence was gathered unconstitutionally

Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.

Holmes' trial date is up in the air while both sides work their way through dozens of pretrial motions.

As dramatic as the cellphone photos are, they will likely be less important to the outcome of the case than a mandatory sanity evaluation that Holmes underwent at the state mental hospital last month.

The verdict on Holmes' sanity is up to the jury, and the evaluation will be a key piece of evidence.

The critical conclusions of the evaluation have not been made public, but prosecutors have asked for another by their own experts, saying the doctor who conducted the first one was biased.

Arapahoe County District Judge Carlos A. Samour Jr. has not said when he will rule on the request. He held a four-day hearing on the issue last month that was closed to the public and reporters.
