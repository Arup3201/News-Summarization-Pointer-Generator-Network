Once royalty and celebrities sipped cocktails on her immaculate decks. But how times have changed for the QE2...

Now, workmen in shorts and T-shirts cooking a pig over a barbecue made from half an oil drum is more the norm.

Below decks, the bars and dining rooms of Cunard’s former flagship are dirty and dingy too as she is seemingly left to rot in obscurity in a Middle East port.

Decay: Workmen are pictured roasting a pig on a makeshift barbecue on one of the decks of the iconic liner. The Queen Elizabeth II has been left to rot in a Dubai dockyard after plans to transform it into a hotel stalled 

Abandoned: For 40 years, the vessel criss-crossed the Atlantic with the biggest celebrities of the day on board. Now the QE2 is languishing in the Gulf city - its planned voyage to China now more than a year overdue

Namesake: For decades the cruise liner was seen as the epitome of glamour and luxury. Above, Queen Elizabeth II is pictured leaving the ship for the last time - just months before it was retired in 2008

Majestic: The vessel, which was built on the Clyde and launched in 1967, was to be converted at a Chinese shipyard into a luxury 400-suite floating hotel. Above, the QE2 arrives in Dubai in November 2008

These photographs show how the latest plan for the world’s most famous liner – whose passengers included the Queen, George W Bush, Nelson Mandela and Hollywood legends including Ginger Rogers and Debbie Reynolds – appear to have stalled.

The QE2 has spent the past six years docked in Dubai awaiting renovation. Last year it was announced she was to return to the seas and was scheduled to depart in October 2013 and sail to China.

She was then to be converted into a £60million 400-suite floating hotel before travelling to her final destination, a yet to be announced Asian city, at the end of this year.

The plan also involved revamping the ballroom, seven restaurants, ten lounges and cinema. But she has yet to set sail, and her sorry state has angered former crew and campaigners who want her to be restored to her old splendour.

Yesterday Louis de Sousa, 43, of Bitzen, Germany, who was a bartender on the QE2 for nine years in the 1990s and received these photos of her from workers he befriended on Facebook, said: ‘The ship is an icon, but she’s just sitting there rotting.

Maiden voyage: The QE2 was initially designed as a transatlantic service between her home port of Southampton and New York. Above, well-wishers gather to send off the ship before it sets sail for the first time

Dignified: During her years of service, the QE2 undertook regular world cruises and was known as the height of glamour. Above, the vessel sails past the Statue of Liberty  as it comes to the end of its maiden voyage

Power: On the QE2's maiden voyage (above), passengers dressed for dinner in formal gowns and tuxedos and top-name stars entertained. Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor were among those who travelled on board

‘It would have been better if she’d just gone to the scrapyard then we could have kept our good memories. Seeing her like this makes me feel sad.’ He described the pig roast photos, taken in 2012 in Dubai’s Port Rashid, as ‘disrespectful’.

The other photos which Mr de Sousa – who remembers functions on the QE2 attended by Lady Thatcher and Rod Stewart – sent to the Daily Mail were taken between June this year and last week.

Rob Lightbody, 42, of Glasgow, who runs the world’s most popular QE2 website, said: ‘They keep making all these announcements about what’s going to happen to her, then it just goes silent and now she’s just sitting there.

‘She is the last of her type – British built, British designed, and originally British crewed. She is in the wrong place. Most people in Dubai don’t even know she’s there, nor do they care.’

Star-studded: Originally featuring three classes of service, the ship appealed to celebrities such  Elton John (left), Peter Sellers (right) and Ringo Starr (far right). It also captured the imagination of the less affluent

Alan Snelson, a photographer who worked on the ship, told arabianbusiness.com: ‘If no viable plan can be put in place by her owners then they should release her to someone who can save her before the damage is irreversible.’

The 963ft ship carried almost 2.5million passengers and completed more than 700 Atlantic crossings following her launch from the John Brown shipyard in Clydebank in 1967.

The QE2’s home port was then Southampton for 40 years until she left for the last time in November 2008 after being sold to Dubai for £70million.

No one from the Oceanic Group, which unveiled the plans to ‘transform the QE2 into a luxurious heritage five-star hotel’ last year, was available to comment yesterday.

Fanfare: Crowds line the waterfront to greet the QE2 as it sails into Southampton in 1987. It was reported last year that the vessel had been readied for its voyage to China, where it was to be refitted as a hotel

Stately: The Marine Traffic website, which monitors the movements of ships, shows that as of 18 November, the QE2 still hasn't left Dubai. Above, the vessel was capable of reaching a top speed of 39mph

The QE2 was initially designed as a transatlantic service between her home port of Southampton and New York.

Operated by Cunard, she began an almost 40 year career in 1969 and served as the flagship of the line until succeeded by RMS Queen Mary 2 in 2004.

During her years of service, the QE2 undertook regular world cruises and was known as being the height of glamour.

Originally featuring three classes of service, the ship appealed to stars such as Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton and also captured the imagination of those less affluent, who were blocked by stairways and elevators from entering first-class spaces even for a peek.

Passengers dressed for dinner in formal gowns and tuxedos and top-name show-biz stars entertained.

In May 1982 she even took part in the Falklands War, carrying 3000 troops and 650 volunteer crews.

This involved her being refitted with three helicopter pads, dormitories and fuel pipes to allow for refuelling at sea.

Incredibly, more than 650 Cunard crew members volunteered for the voyage to transport the members of the Fifth Infantry Brigade.

The vessel returned to the UK in June 1982 and was greeted in Southampton by Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother.
