Suspect: CCTV of a man wanted by Durham Police in connection with theft offences in B&Q

Two pensioners have come forward after police released a CCTV image of a man suspected of stealing but who is the spitting image of them.

Bernard Place, 80, and Edmund Britton, 76, both did a double take after seeing the picture of the suspect wanted by North Yorkshire Police printed in their local newspaper.

Both Mr Britton and Mr Place fear those who know them may think they are involved. And they want to make it clear that they are not responsible for the alleged crime.

Mr Britton, 76, said that he was 'embarrassed' over the doppleganger image.

He said: 'The first I saw of it was when I spotted my picture in the paper yesterday.

'It's embarrassing, everyone was telling me that they couldn't believe how similar the person in the paper is to me.'

Their doppelganger is suspected to have bought items from B&Q in Northallerton on October 4 and then returned to the store later that day, taking the same items from the shelves and using the receipt from the first purchase to obtain a refund.

Police issued a CCTV image to the press and appealed for information. But as soon as the photo was published the two local OAPs spotted the similarity.

Mr Britton, of Darlington, County Durham, said: 'It looks identical to me. The clothes on the man look identical to what I would wear, the glasses look very much the same. It is me to a T.'

He said he was concerned that people who knew him would believe he may have been involved in the crime.

Mr Britton, who used to a run a family business, Heats Parts, in Darlington, now run by his daughter, added: 'If any of my customers see this in the newspaper they will think it is me.

He added: 'I'm a well known face around the area because of my business, so a lot of customers know me.

'That was really concerning for me - not only could it have been so embarrassing, but I was worried about the business.

'I contacted the paper as soon as I saw it and the police. The police seemed slightly interested but nobody seems to have done anything about it as yet.

'I don't know what's going to happen with it now, but I'd like it sorting before more people start ringing me up about it.'

Mr Britton was shocked to hear that another pensioner had also called in to express his concerns about how similar he appeared to the wanted thief.

Mr Place, also from Darlington, said: 'I did a double take when I saw it. It looks exactly like me.

'I showed the wife, and she said: 'It's you,' It's a bit worrying really.

'All my friends and family said the man in the picture looks identical to me.'
