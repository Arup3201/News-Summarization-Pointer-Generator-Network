A terminally ill woman who was granted the right to die after a court battle with her own parents then had a last-minute change of heart will be home for the holidays.

Grace Sung Eun Lee, a Manhattan bank manager who fought her family for the right to die then signed a document allowing her deeply religious father to make decisions about her healthcare, is being moved from the hospital to the family's home in Queens.

'Grace will be taken care (of) at home in Douglaston,' her brother, Paul Lee, wrote in an e-mail to supporters. 'We just wanted you to know that this wouldn't have been possible without your help.'

Bitter battle: Grace Sung Eun Lee, centre, is on breathing tubes following a seizure from a brain tumour, but her parents will not allow her to be removed from the tubes

Ms Lee had told her parents and the doctors: ‘I want to die.’

But
because her parents are deeply religious and belong to a Korean 
Christian church in Queens, they believe that allowing her daughter to 
choose death over life is a sin.

A judge at the state appeals court yesterday sided with Ms Lee after the rift with her parents led to an agonising legal battle for the family.

But 24 hours later, she signed over her decision-making abilities to her father, Rev. Manho Lee, according to WABC-TV.

He is certain to keep her on life 
support for as long as possible, as he believes that if she removes her 
breathing tube she will have committed suicide, which he regards as a 
sin.

Ms Lee, a 28-year-old former bank manager from New York, said the decision would allow her 'to make peace with my God'.

Speaking with the New York Daily News, Ms Lee’s mother, Jin-ah Lee, said: ‘Despite all this confusion, (my daughter) wants to go to heaven. I keep telling her she can get better.’

Her daughter is currently at Long Island North Shore Hospital, hooked up to breathing tubes that are keeping her alive. She is paralysed from the neck down due to the tumour on her brain stem.

Ms Lee’s father is Antioch Missionary Church reverend Manho Lee, and practices out of his church in the Flushing neighbourhood of Queens. His congregation flocked behind him to pray for Ms Lee and tell her of God's plans for her life.

The sin of suicide, they said, would condemn their daughter's soul to hell.

The difference in beliefs led to an emergency end-of-life hearing at the hospital, with the two sides bitterly re-affirming their respective stances.

Meeting: On October 1, there was a press conference at North Shore Hospital to inform the media of Grace's condition

Speaking on behalf of Ms Lee, Dr Dana Lustbader testified that the patient ‘consistently asks that her breathing tube be removed.’

However, Rev Lee and his wife argued that their daughter is heavily medicated, and is not lucid enough to make the life-or-death decision.

Doctors said that her medications, including morphine and an anti-anxiety medication, are not strong enough to cloud her judgment. 

Ms Lee’s troubles began last year. Before her illness, she worked as a manager for Bank of America, living and working in Manhattan.

She was also training for the famous New York City marathon.

She had emigrated with her parents from Seoul, South Korea, the Daily News reported. But Ms Lee was devastated when she was diagnosed with a tumour in her brain stem.

Though she received chemotherapy and radiation, the treatments did not successfully target the tumour, and last month, she had a seizure that eventually left her paralysed. 

Ms Lee had apparently talked to nurses at North Shore about removing the tubes, but her parents interceded.

A Facebook page entitled Save Grace SungEun Lee cited a passage from the Old Testament, which reads: ‘”For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord. “Plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.”’

A post from reads: ‘We can see God’s powers working every day and know that God has a plan for her too!’

Children from the congregation have written notes of encouragement for the 28-year-old, with one writing: ‘I hope you feel better. I miss you, Grace Teacher.’

Cultural, as well as religious differences have come to play in Ms Lee’s case. Rev Young Gab Hyun said: ‘In Korean culture... we believe that the decisions that the parents make have a lot more influence in this type of matter.’

Words of love: Young members of the church offered kind words to Ms Lee, calling her 'Grace Teacher,' and pleading with her to come back soon

‘The role of religion in medial decision making really pertains to the patient,’ Tia Powell, M.D., the director of Montefiore Einstein Center for Bioethics, told MailOnline.

‘If the patient is capable of making her decisions, then that’s where we would honour.’

Dr Powell added that while it may be heart-wrenching for the parents to face, she said the goal of bioethics is to bring the families together. ‘The question is not whether she’s going to die, it’s how she’s going to die.

‘There’s nothing worse than losing a child,’ she said, ‘but there are limits to medical treatment. There are many things we cannot fix, we cannot perform miracles.’

Dr Powell said that there are some practices that could help Ms Lee’s parents come to terms with their daughter’s illness. ‘These are religious people, and they know we are all mortal,’ she said. ‘Being clear about that can maybe help decrease their suffering.’
