Aptly titled 'Hunks and Hounds', it aims to raise funds for the charity and promote animal rights.

New York City-based animal rescue group Louie's Legacy Animal Group has unveiled its 2015 calendar, featuring topless male models posing with some of the charity's dogs 

Louie's Legacy is a non-profit animal rescue charity that saves, rehabilitates and re-homes animals from high-kill shelters across the United States, including Cincinnati, Ohio and Staten Island, New York.

The photographs were shot by New York celebrity photographer Mike Ruiz.

After adopting his pet pit bull Oliver in 2012, Mike, 49, began brainstorming about a project that would help more animals in need, eventually settling on a charity calendar. 

The idea was an immediate success - Mike shot the calendar over the course of two days last month and started taking pre-orders on the very first day.

The calendar is called 'Hunks and Hounds'

The 2015 planner will raise funds for the charity and promote animal rights 

Each of the shots were posed for by male models and animals from rescue shelters 

He said: 'It has been a wild success, far beyond our expectations. 

'We are so happy that so many more dogs who need to be adopted or fostered will now have the chance.'

As a sweetener to entice more women to buy the calendar, he has also revealed that most of the men posing for the various pictures are currently single.  

He said: 'I just hope that people enjoy the images, and that they are reminded daily that adopting and loving an animal is the most humane thing a person can do.'

The pictures were taken by celebrity photographer Mike Ruiz 

The calendar was made over the course of two days last month

Just 24 hours into the calendar being made, the animal shelter was already inundated with pre-order requests

'I hope we sell a million so that Louie's Legacy can broaden their services to be able to help more dogs find forever homes.'

Mike arrived in New York from Canada aged 21 with just £190 ($300) in his pocket. 

In the 28 years since, he has become a famous fashion photographer, workng with celebrities including Katy Perry, Kim Kardashian and Nicki Minaj.

He said:  'What inspired me to become a photographer was really my need to communicate certain things that I couldn't do with words. 

'The camera became a conduit for me to express myself effectively.

'I have been so fortunate to have many of my dreams come to fruition and I feel that I need to pay something back.'
