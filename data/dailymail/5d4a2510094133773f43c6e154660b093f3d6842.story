The discovery of the 4,400-year-old burial site of a woman adorned with gold jewellery has prompted speculation that Windsor's royal connection goes back further than suspected.

Archaeologists working in a quarry near the royal family's Berkshire residence have unearthed a rare Copper Age grave of a middle-aged woman buried with some of Britain's oldest gold ornaments.

The find is doubly significant since grave sites from the era containing such fine jewellery, which also included lignite and amber, are usually associated with men.

'It is interesting to think who this woman was within her community,' said site director Gareth Chaffey of Wessex Archaeology, who has worked on the site for the past seven years.

'She was probably an important person in her society, perhaps holding some standing which gave her access to prestigious, rare and exotic items.

'She could have been a leader, a person with power and authority, or possibly part of an elite family - perhaps a princess or queen.'

The Windsor Castle that stands to this
day was begun by William the Conqueror in the decade following the 1066
Norman Conquest, which overthrew the Saxon kings who had previously 
ruled England.

He 
established the site as part of a ring of forts around London intended 
to cement his new position of power and guard against potential 
usurpers.

But experts believe the recently unearthed woman was interred much, much earlier.

They estimate that she was buried between 2,200 and 2,500BC - just a century or two after the construction of Stonehenge.

That stone-circle, which many believe had mystical significance to early Britons, is located just 60 miles to the south-west.

She was found with a large pottery 
drinking vessel, which archaeologists term a 'beaker', dating her to 
communities which lived across Europe at around 2,500 BC.

In more westerly regions like Britain these beaker-using communities were the first to use copper and gold.

At the time of the woman's burial, she
wore a necklace containing small tubular sheet gold beads and black 
disc beads of lignite - a material similar to jet.

A
number of larger perforated amber buttons were also found in a row 
along her body, indicating that she may have been wearing clothing, 
perhaps of woven wool, at the time of her burial.

Further lignite beads from near her hands suggest that she also wore a bracelet.

Dr Stuart Needham, an expert in Copper
Age metalwork, who studying the gold beads said: 'Beaker graves of this
date are almost unknown in South East England and only a small number 
of them, and indeed continental Europe, contain gold ornaments.

'The
tubular beads that were found at Kingsmead Quarry are certainly rare in
Britain, and this gives the grave tremendous research importance.'

Lead
isotype analysis has been used to determine that the gold used in the 
jewellery most probably came from deposits located in south-east Ireland
and southern Britain.

The 
lignite beads used in the necklace are believed to have come from the 
east of England, while the amber may have come from as far away as the 
Baltic.

Scientists hope 
further analyses will shed light on the patterns of gold procurement and
the extent of trading networks in prehistoric Britain.

Osteologist Jacqueline McKinley 
examined the skeletal remains. She said they appear to be those of an 
adult aged 35 or over, possibly female.

She
admitted however that the high acidity of the soil around the grave had
led to the degradation of the the bones and collagen precludes the 
possibility of radiocarbon dating and DNA analysis.

Beaker burials of this type are rare in this region of England and, it was an unexpected find, the researchers said.

The Kingsmead Quarry site: Experts say there is an 'extensive prehistoric landscape' buried beneath the quarry and surrounding areas on the edge of West London and East Berkshire

However, as Dr Alistair Barclay of Wessex Archaeology noted, 'we know from recent research that an extensive prehistoric landscape is buried beneath the edge of West London and East Berkshire.

'The Kingsmead Quarry project is currently adding much new and significant information to this unfolding story and challenging our perception and understanding of prehistory.'

The beads will go on display at the end of April at a special two day event organised by Wessex Archaeology and CEMEX UK, the cement firm which owns the Kingsmead Quarry site where they were unearthed.
