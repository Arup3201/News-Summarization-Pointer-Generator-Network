Tragedy: Veteran fireman Shannon Stone died after he fell from the stand in front of his young son

The widow and son of a fireman who plummeted to his death at a Texas Rangers baseball match after trying to catch a ball walked hand-in-hand behind a fire engine carrying his coffin today.

Shannon Stone, 39, died on Thursday after taking his six-year-old boy, Cooper, to a Rangers game, when he fell 20ft from the stands as he tried to catch a foul ball from Josh Hamilton for his son.

Front-office executives from the Rangers and firemen from across the state have remembered Stone at a memorial service and then an eight-mile fire truck procession to a cemetery.

‘It's still difficult to accept, obviously, the nature of the death and the timing of the death and the way that it happened,' Brownwood Mayor Stephen Haynes said.

The family asked that the church congregation was made up of family and friends. Everyone else was asked to line the cemetery route.

The fireman was remembered fondly at the memorial service for his kindness, love of baseball and skill as both a firefighter and a loving dad, witnesses said.

Stone took his son to the game in Arlington on Thursday night. They stopped to buy the boy a new glove on the way, and sat in left field, behind Cooper's favourite player, Josh Hamilton.

Hamilton threw them a foul ball, but the thrill quickly turned tragic. Stone fell head-first about 20ft onto concrete, with Cooper watching.

Witnesses said Stone was conscious after landing and spoke about Cooper being left alone. He was pronounced dead within an hour. An autopsy ruled the cause as blunt force trauma from the fall.

Stone had been with the Brownwood 
fire department since 1993. He was voted Firefighter of the Year twice 
by his peers, according to the mayor, and had risen to the rank of 
lieutenant.

He also worked as a paramedic, and as
a rescue technician at Texas Motor Speedway. He also was involved in 
disaster relief following Hurricanes Katrina and Ike, and fighting 
wildfires.

Scotty Burke, who was a Brownwood 
police officer for 14 years and is now on the Lake Patrol, described 
Stone as a ‘firefighter's firefighter’.

He recalled that during the town's 
annual, three-day reunion celebration, Stone cooked a barbecue for the 
officers and firemen working at the event. ‘He always did it out of his 
pocket,’ Mr Burke said.

‘Brownwood is a tight place,’ Mr Burke said. ‘When something like this happens, people come together and they take care of you.’

Brownwood is a town of about 20,000 
residents in the Hill Country of central Texas, some 150 miles west of 
the Rangers' stadium in Arlington. Flags across the area have been at 
half-mast since Friday.

Floral tribute: Wreaths and flowers were placed outside the Central Fire Station in Brownwood in memory of Shannon Stone of the Brownwood Fire Department on Friday

Help: Fellow fan Ronnie Hargis, who had been chatting to the victim moments before the tragedy, leans out to try and grab him but it is too late

Several wreaths and a dozen yellow roses were 
left in his memory at a monument outside the fire department.

The little boy, Cooper, witnessed the
whole incident in horror and screamed desperately for his daddy - whose
last words as he lay dying on the pitch were for someone to check on 
his son.

The boy's mother choked back tears as she said the pair had gone to the match in the hope of a ball.

She said: 'That's what they were 
there for was to catch a ball. Cooper loves baseball and he's a big Josh
Hamilton fan. Had his jersey.'

The Rangers players are said to be 
distraught over Stone's death on Thursday night, and they have all 
been offered grief counselling.

Hamilton - who overcame drug and 
alcohol addictions to emerge as a devout Christian and an All-Star 
outfielder - is said to be particularly heartbroken as he has young 
children himself.

He said: 'It was just hard for me, 
hearing the little boy screaming for his daddy after he had fallen - and
then being home with my kids, really hit home. That's one of the main 
things I remember.'

He told the New York Times: 'It’s 
like it happened in slow motion. Here was a little boy, screaming for 
his daddy after he had fallen. I saw him just tip over the edge there. 
It was disbelief.’

The team 
had a moment of silence for Stone, an 18-year veteran firefighter, 
and wore black ribbons during Friday night's game, which continued a bad 
week for the reigning MVP.

A foul ball Hamilton hit during the 
sixth inning against the Oakland A's smacked another fan in the face, 
requiring him to get stitches.

Stone's fatal fall - watched by a 
crowd of 35,041 - has raised doubts over the safety of stadiums and the 
time-honoured tradition of throwing balls to fans.

In a statement, Major League Baseball
said its 'players are encouraged to be fan-friendly and we will 
carefully review this incident with our clubs to continue to ensure a 
safe environment for our fans'.

Texas team president Nolan Ryan 
revealed that they would be setting up a memorial fund for the Stone 
family. He called it a 'very,very sad day for the Texas Rangers 
organisation'.

'It hits us at our roots of what we 
are,’ he said. ‘We're about making memories, about family entertainment 
and last night we had a father and son at the game and had a very tragic
incident.'

Former president George W. Bush, who
used to be the team's managing general partner and often attends games,
was sitting in the front row with Mr Ryan when the 
accident happened.
