Lewis Hamilton was again happy to cast himself in the role of his hero Ayrton Senna, raising the possibility of infamy repeating itself on the typhoon-threatened Suzuka track on Sunday.

It was here, unforgettably, that the rivalry of Senna and Alain Prost reached its nasty zenith with collisions in their title fights of 1989 and 1990.

What chance Hamilton and his championship rival Nico Rosberg turning their silver cars against each other?

Asked if an injustice — such as Rosberg causing him to crash at Spa six weeks ago, perhaps — would incite him to act as Senna did, Hamilton said: ‘Yeah, I think that’s human nature. I’m pretty sure everyone has been through an experience like that, and if they haven’t, good for them.

‘If someone does you wrong, you feel like going all out on them. That’s just normal. It could be from a relationship, where you’ve got a girl and some dude comes and messes with your chick, and you want to kill that dude. It’s the same kind of thing. The same kind of injustice.’

The analogy may have been a bit mid-Atlantic in its argot, a bit ill-judged in its tone. But it was hardly stranger than his remarks about the vagaries of ill-luck.

‘It’s like Mother Teresa,’ he said. ‘You can’t do anything about what she decides.’

A collision at Suzuka in 1989 between McLaren team-mates Alain Prost  and Ayrton Senna had handed the world title to Prost. The following year, at the same circuit, Senna claimed pole but was enraged when his appeal to switch to the cleaner side of the track was rejected. He vowed that if Prost — now driving for Ferrari and the only man who could beat Senna to the crown — gained the advantage into the first corner, Senna would try to take the lead regardless of the consequences. The two duly came together at the first corner, sending both off the track. The crash meant that Senna had clinched the drivers’ championship for McLaren for a second time.

Given that the Blessed sister helped the poor of Calcutta rather than determined the fates of racing drivers, it can only be assumed he meant Mother Nature, whose reach purportedly extends far beyond the Indian subcontinent.

Returning to Senna-Prost, Hamilton said: ‘I think Senna had a sheer belief that something was his.’

Hamilton was excusing Senna’s actions here in this bleak town in the Far East — taking Prost out on the first lap in 1990 — on the basis that the Brazilian was merely avenging the Frenchman crashing into him towards the end of the previous title decider.

Senna's feud with Prost came to boiling point at Suzuka in 1989, where the Brazilian came off second best after a collision

There are concerns about whether the Japanese Grand Prix will even take place due to the arrival of Typhoon Phanfone

Hamilton was aged only four and five on those occasions, but he claims to remember the two incidents. They are probably patched into his memory by the recent Senna movie that charts what are probably the two most memorable moments in motor-racing history.

‘It was a cool period of time in Formula One,’ he said. ‘I had just started watching at that time with my dad. When I watch it back nowadays, the second crash, that was cool. With the other one it’s very hard to call who was right or wrong when they were at the chicane. It wasn’t black and white.

‘I’ve always felt like I could relate or had a good connection with Ayrton. He was always my favourite driver. I have felt a lot of things in my life that I think he may have felt. I related to him more than any other driver.’

The similarities between the Senna-Prost era and Hamilton-Rosberg is helped by the German’s thoughtful manner, which makes him a latter-day ‘Professor’ Prost. Rosberg has made no promise to punt Hamilton off here, saying only: ‘It’s nice to hear comparisons like those because they are two of the greats. But personally I feel it’s a completely different battle.’

It is still a scrap for which any petrolhead would willingly set his alarm at 7.50am for an advertised start 10 minutes later in the dawn of your British Sabbath. But, be warned, you may not be tuning into the race but into a typhoon, waffling pundits or simply a package of highlights.

There is no certainty that the Japanese Grand Prix will actually take place because of Typhoon Phanfone’s expected arrival. Organisers spent Friday exchanging emails containing data from various meteorological authorities.

They are delaying a decision on whether to shift the start of the race but, as of last night, said they were ‘95 per cent certain’ it would be staged as scheduled. What is really putting the wind up F1 people is that the next race is a week Sunday, 5,000 miles away in Russia. Getting the freight out on Monday, when the typhoon is most widely tipped to hit town, will be extremely hard. The scheduling is absurd.

A storm was also brewing along the paddock concerning Fernando Alonso and his future at Ferrari. The growing feeling is that the Spaniard will leave at the end of the season, with his destination unknown.

A swap deal with Sebastian Vettel? Go to McLaren, where he would probably force Jenson Button’s departure and be made outright No 1? Wait for any fallout at Mercedes? Take a year off?
