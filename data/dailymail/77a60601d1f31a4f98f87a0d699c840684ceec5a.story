A pensioner has become the first to receive a 100th birthday congratulatory message from the Queen written in Welsh.

Emrys Evans opened his card wishing him well on reaching the milestone on Wednesday as he celebrated with family and friends.

The former farm worker and gardener struggles to understand English because he wears hearing aids and finds it much easier when people speak to him in Welsh, his first language.

A 100-year-old man has received the first-ever congratulatory telegram from the Queen, pictured, written in Welsh

Mr Evans, who lives in a nursing home in St Asaph in Denbighshire, North Wales, said: ‘I was very pleased that the Queen’s card was written in Welsh.’

His son Elfed said that The Welsh Language Commissioner arranged for the card to be in Welsh after palace officials were initially reluctant. ‘We were a bit surprised that this was the first telegram to be written in Welsh,’ he added.

At the time of the 2011 census there were 610 people in Wales aged 100 years or over and Rachel Stanyer who also lives in Trefnant celebrated her 105th birthday on Tuesday.

Emrys Evans was born in the Chapel House in Prion, near Denbigh, and remembers collecting water from a well for his partially sighted mother.

The centenarian, who has a daughter called Dilys, three grandchildren and four great grandchildren, said: 'I've never driven a car, or tractor, only horses and we would plough, harrow and sow the fields that way.

'The village had no pipeline and a man called T P Roberts had one built and then he opened a shop selling bread, only bread.

'Eventually he opened a bakery in Vale Road, Denbigh and that was where I had my first job delivering bread by bike.

'The first farm I worked on was called Pen Bryn Llwyn in Llanrhaedr but I worked on a lot of others.

'I worked as a gardener for Howell's School in Denbigh but was more of a weeder than a gardener.

'I was very pleased that the Queen's card was written in Welsh, it's very special and I think it's made history."
