Welcome to the world! U.S. Track and Field runner Alysia Montaño gave birth to baby daughter Linnea on August 15

Won't stop: Montaño continued to run well into her pregnancy, competing in the U.S. Track and Field championships at the end of June at 34 weeks pregnant

With the approval and encouragement of doctors, Montaño continued to compete and train throughout her pregnancy.

At 34 weeks, Montaño ran the 800-meter race at the U.S. Track and Field Championships at the end of June in Sacramento, California.

The 28-year-old former University of California track star finished last in her heat, but that didn't matter for the then-expectant mom.

'That took away any fear of what the outside world might think about a woman running during her pregnancy,' Montaño said at the time.

'What I found out mostly was that exercising during pregnancy is actually much better for the mom and the baby. ... I did all the things I normally do ... I just happened to be pregnant. This is my normal this year.'

Montaño finished the race with a time of 2 minutes and 32 seconds, 35 minutes slower than her personal best of 1 minute and 57 seconds.

'I've been running throughout my pregnancy and I felt really, really good during the whole process,' Montaño said. 'I just didn't want to get lapped and be the first person to get lapped in the 800.'

While she trailed the leading pack by more than 120 meters during the race, Montaño never came close to getting lapped.

And just turning up helped her get some of the loudest cheers of the day.

A standing ovation started as Montaño wound around for the first lap and it just got louder until she crossed the finish line at the end.

Montaño is nicknamed he 'flying flower' for the signature hair accessory she always wears while racing.

Linnea is her and husband Louis' first child. They were married in 2011.

In the past four years, Montaño has won some 800 national titles.
