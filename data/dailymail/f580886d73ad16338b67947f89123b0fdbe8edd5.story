A source 'familiar with the divorce' 
told the newspaper by the time Katie and Cruise reached their divorce 
settlement on Monday she had hired three law firms in three different 
states.

The settlement marked a rapid 
conclusion to negotiations between the former couple's lawyers - just 11
days after the Dawson's Creek star filed to end their marriage.

Katie is thought to have won her main objective - primary custody of their six-year-old little girl, Suri.

Suri will remain with Katie in New 
York, where they currently reside, and will allegedly be accompanied by 
her own nanny and team of bodyguards when she visits father Tom on 
weekly occasions.

Tom is expected to pay a 'substantial' sum to his soon-to-be third ex-wife in property, assets and child support.

A pre-nuptial agreement is said to 
have limited the amount he was obliged to pay, but it's accepted that  
he would almost have included a hefty 'goodwill' payoff to help bring 
talks to a speedy conclusion.

She is said to have also pushed to 
have an 'ironclad' clause included in the agreement limiting Suri's 
involvement with Tom's controversial religion, Scientology, according to RadarOnline.

'Under terms of the settlement, Suri 
isn’t permitted to be exposed to anything Scientology-related, and this 
includes going to any Scientology churches, parties, etc.

Instead, Katie is thought to have 
enrolled her in one of New York's top private schools to continue her 
education, after spending her early years being home schooled.

Katie and Tom - who married in Italy 
in 2006 - made no comment on the terms of the settlement yesterday; 
instead they released a joint statement affirming their commitment to 
their daughter.

'We are committed to working together as parents to accomplish what is in our daughter Suri’s best interests.

'We want to keep matters affecting our
family private and express our respect for each other’s commitment to 
each of our respective beliefs and support each other’s roles as 
parents.'

Katie's lawyer Jonathan Wolfe said: 
'This case has been settled and the agreement has been signed. We are 
thrilled for Katie and her family and are excited to watch as she 
embarks on the next chapter of her life.

'We thank Tom's counsel for their professionalism and diligence that helped bring about this speedy resolution.'

Katie sat down with Elle magazine a 
mere six weeks before filing; in an interview set to hit stands on July 
17, the actress opens up about growing into herself.

Admitting as a young girl she 
struggled with her sexual confidence, she said: 'I always felt like a 
little girl before... I didn't even know what sexy was.

'Anytime you feel good about yourself, you embody sexiness. It's almost like a power or a confidence or a secret.'

She also spoke about how she deals with confrontation.

'If something's not okay, then I make 
it known,. I will deal with things... the way my mom taught us girls how
to be. She stressed listen, learn, always be strong and be true to 
yourself,' she said.

In previously-released quotes from the sit-down, Katie also brushed off any pressure to being 'Mrs Tom Cruise'.

'He has been Tom Cruise for 30 years. I
know who I am and where I am and where I want to go, so I want to focus
on that,' she said.
