It was a moment his parents feared they would never see.

Told he had a 10cm liver tumour which was not responding to chemotherapy, Mark and Gemma Pearson feared their son Loki would die.

But to their relief, he defied expectations to survive a life-saving liver transplant and is now thriving.

Loki Pearson, eight months old, was diagnosed with liver cancer when he was just five months old

Loki, now eight months old, was diagnosed with liver cancer when he was just five months old.

He underwent weeks of gruelling chemotherapy before doctors decided it would not work and began searching for a donor.

He underwent a seven-hour operation to replace his liver with that of a teenage boy.

And a month later he is recovering well to the delight of his parents.

Mr Pearson, 40, said: ‘I honestly thought I was going to lose my baby son to cancer.

‘It doesn’t even seem possible. But it’s an enormous relief that Loki looks like he’s recovering.’

Doctors told Mr and Mrs Pearson it was extremely rare for a child so young to be diagnosed with liver cancer.

Mr Pearson said: ‘The doctors said it is more common when children are about three years old, but it’s near enough unheard of for a baby as young as Loki to get the diagnosis.’

Loki was found to have a 10cm tumour on his liver after his stomach swelled and he lost his appetite. He is pictured with his parents, Gemma and Mark, and his older sister, Summer

Mrs Pearson, 24, said that Loki started to get unwell around Christmas time - beginning what would become a hellish few months.

She said: ‘His stomach was all swollen up, he was obviously in a lot of pain and wasn’t really eating anything.

‘Loki didn’t ever seem happy either, he was always crying and seemed distressed. It was so upsetting to see your child in so much pain.’

Liver cancer is rare type of cancer that usually affects older people.

Symptoms are often vague and do not appear until the cancer is at an advanced stage.

They include unexplained weight loss, nausea, vomiting, tiredness and jaundice.

In the UK almost 4,000 cases of liver cancer are diagnosed every year and about 70 per cent of cases are in people over the age of 65.

The disease is linked to excessive alcohol consumption and to hepatitis B and C infections.

Only about 10 children a year in the UK develop liver tumours.

They are more common in boys than in girls.

The cause of liver tumours in children is not known.

The couple, from Denaby Main, South Yorkshire, took Loki to see their GP, who sent him to Doncaster Royal Infirmary.

Mr Pearson said: ‘When we were at the hospital they did loads of scans on him and told us that Loki had cancer in his liver.

‘It was such a shock to hear that Loki had cancer, we couldn’t believe it - you don’t hear of babies having cancer. It was heart-breaking.’

Loki then underwent tests at both Sheffield Children’s Hospital and Leeds Teaching Hospitals before undergoing a course of chemotherapy in Sheffield.

Mr Pearson said: ‘What doctors were going to do was use chemotherapy to shrink the tumour down and then surgically remove it from the liver.

‘But the tumour was about 10cm wide, which is really big for a baby.

‘The chemotherapy didn’t work, though, and the doctors told us that the tumour had not shrunk down to the size where they could remove it.’

The couple were then told that Loki would need a transplant operation to survive.

A week later they were told a donor had been found and headed to Leeds only to discover the donor wasn’t a match.

Mrs Pearson stayed at hospital with Loki while Mr Pearson returned home to look after their eldest daughter, Summer Rose, five, who was staying with relatives.

But early the next afternoon, doctors told the parents another donor had been found.

Mr Pearson said: ‘It was a mixture of massive relief - but then the fear of losing Loki in the operating theatre kicked in.

‘We don’t know anything about the donor, apart from it was from a teenage boy and the surgeons had to trim the liver down for Loki.

‘The operation was about seven hours long.

‘When we were told everything had gone to plan, we were so happy. It was the best feeling of my life knowing Loki was well.’

Barely a month later, the couple are already noticing a difference in Loki.

Loki is now recovering after his liver transplant but will need to take anti-rejection drugs all his life

Mrs Pearson said: ‘When Loki was ill, he was so pale, with black eyes - he looked like a little ghost.

‘But now he’s getting back to normal - the colour has returned to his cheeks, he’s eating, playing, laughing and giggling, it’s amazing to see him happy.’

Loki is still being monitored closely by doctors and will have to take anti-rejection drugs for the rest of his life.

Mr Pearson said: ‘This whole thing has just been a living nightmare for our family.

‘But our little boy’s alive, he’s got his shot at life and we couldn’t be happier.’
