A millionaire property developer is embroiled in a planning row with his council after he was ordered to remove two £15,000 lion-topped gate posts from his castle.

Edward Packer, 73, is furious after officials ruled that the
12ft high Bath stone pillars outside his seven-bedroom £1.7million property are 'out 
of keeping' with the local area.

The gateposts, which were modelled on the entrance to Chepstow Racecourse, were built without planning permission just before Christmas.

Country pile: Edward Packer has been ordered to pull down these £15,000 lion-topped pillars outside his castle because he doesn't have planning permission

Order: Mr Packer, 73, received a council enforcement notice over the 12ft Bath stone pillars he had built just before Christmas

The builder, who moved into his 1840s property around 15 years ago, has been handed an enforcement notice and told to remove them.

But Mr Packer says the posts have been
well-received by local residents and has vowed to fight the 'unelected 
officials' who are demanding their removal.

The property magnate, who lives in the
exclusive Sneyd Park area of Bristol, said: 'An Englishman's home is 
supposed to be his castle.

'Well, I live in a castle but it 
doesn't feel that way after seeing these officials come up here and tell
me to take my pillars down.'

His property is one of the most 
exclusive addresses in Bristol and has around ten acres of land backing 
onto the stunning Avon Gorge.

Mr Packer has instructed his lawyers to challenge the enforcement notice, a process he expects to cost him £3,000.

He criticised Bristol's general 
attitude towards planning policy, adding: 'You can't get anything done 
in this city. We haven't got a decent football stadium and no concert 
venue either.'

A letter from the council states the 
new pillars are 'out of keeping' with the listed house and have 'no 
substantial public benefit'.

But Mr Packer disputes the council's claim and says the posts are an asset, which enhance the road.

He said: 'They say it is out of 
context with the area, but it's the area which is out of context with 
our house, with all the modern developments which were allowed to be 
built around here.

'I see the posts as an asset, which enhances the folly. I haven't met one person who doesn't like them.

'It seems that in the hands of these unelected officials who come up here it must be pulled down.'

The builder, who grew up on a Bristol council estate, said he was unaware his new gate posts would need planning permission.

The businessman criticised the 'draconian' council which, he claims, will not even allow him to apply for consent retrospectively.

He said: 'I didn't realise we needed planning permission for the pillars.

'I found out afterwards that anything above 3ft needed permission so I applied for retrospective planning and they wouldn't have it.

'They won't even let me speak to a conservation officer. The council is so draconian, trees have more rights than people here.

'It is not like it is a block of flats I've just built, they are pillars at the front of a home in a quiet cul-de-sac. What harm will they do? Not one person has complained to me.

'I've lived at the home for 15 years and we've spent thousands restoring it.

'The councillors are a waste of time, they just rubber stamp what unelected planners say. The planners and politicians in Bristol are too busy fighting each other to help the people.

'We've now got to wait for an officer from the Department of Environment to make an independent decision.'

Mr Packer, who still works six days a
week despite being 73, says nobody has contacted him personally other 
than to say they didn't like the colour.

He added: 'The council said the 
pillars are out of context with the home, but the whole area is out of 
context with the home so that point is a load of rubbish.

'Apparently there have been five 
complaints but no one has told me they don't like the gates. One person 
said they didn't like the colour.

'Some people have been talking about me like I'm some toff.

'My father was a prisoner of war in 
Japan and he died in 1950 because of it. My mother bought me up in a 
council house in Bristol. I'm just a working class, hard working 
builder.'

The council has defended the decision,
claiming the authority's planning department had received five 
complaints about the pillars.

Spokesman Peter Wood said: 
'Enforcement officers met with colleagues in the Heritage and 
Conservation Team and assessed the pillars to be harmful to the setting 
of the listed building and this part of the Sneyd Park Conservation 
Area.

Mr Packer's appeal is being dealt with by the independent Planning Inspectorate.
