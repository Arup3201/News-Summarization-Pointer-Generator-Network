A hapless smuggler who tried sneaking an incredible 146 iPhones through Chinese customs by strapping them to his body was caught after officers spotted him walking strangely.

Chan Shih, 30, was found with 126 phones taped around his waist and another 20 around his legs while travelling from Hong Kong to the Chinese mainland, reports People's Daily Online.

A customs spokesman said: 'He appeared to be a big man and was wearing a very loose fitting T-shirt and trousers and had a small carry bag.

'But as he moved towards the Nothing to Declare exit officers noticed he was having difficulty with walking and asked him if he was OK.

'He said he had injured his back after falling over but officers were suspicious so asked him to go through a metal detector.

'When it went off he said it was because of his gold bracelet, but when officers searched him they found the phones cellotaped around his stomach.

'Then they found more around his calves.'

The haul from the known smuggler was the biggest ever seized by Chinese customs

The customs official - from Louhu checkpoint in Shenzhen - added that this was not the first time the man had been caught trying to sneak electronic goods onto the mainland, but it was the first time he had been caught with so many.

It was also a record in phone smuggling for a single person.

The spokesman said: 'This is the fifth time he has been caught smuggling since 2011.

'In total he has tried to bring in 511 iPhones and 127 CPUs, all of which he strapped to parts of his body.

'He needs to think of a new way of doing it as it is getting a bit obvious.'

The man was arrested and is now awaiting trial.
