Kris Boyd hit a hat-trick as Rangers thrashed Clyde 8-1 on Monday night but the striker felt his team-mate Lewis Macleod was a stand-out man of the match.

Boyd also had a goal disallowed for a contentious offside decision but his analysis was spot-on as Macleod produced a creative midfield display that Clyde could not cope with.

The 20-year-old also scored twice in the Petrofac Training Cup second-round game, curling home a right-footed shot from 25 yards before firing home with his left foot.

Boyd, whose goals were his first since returning to Rangers in the summer, said: 'It was great to get off the mark again. You become frustrated when you're not scoring but I've shown over my career that I'm not going to hide away from the fact that I've missed chances. I keep coming back for more.

'I think it all clicked. I thought Lee McCulloch was fantastic getting about the pitch and breaking up play.

'And I thought Lewis Macleod was by far the man of the match. He took the game by the scruff of the neck right from the first whistle and took it right to Clyde. He was fantastic. He got a couple of goals and he was brilliant.'

Boyd had sympathy for former team-mate Barry Ferguson, whose managerial return to Ibrox could not have gone much worse.

Ferguson set up with a 4-3-3 formation throughout in a bid to attack Rangers but it was not until the final minute that they notched their solitary goal.

'It's always difficult when you are managing a part-time team coming to a club this size and trying to get a result,' Boyd said.

'I think a lot of those guys would have been working during the day as well.

'We knew we had to put on a performance. We know it's not been good enough and I think we put that right. We started the game at a high tempo, stopped them playing and got in their faces right up the pitch. It was a joy to play out there.'

Meanwhile, Rangers manager Ally McCoist is hopeful that Cammy Bell's shoulder injury is not as bad as first feared.

Bell missed the visit of Clyde after damaging his shoulder during the 2-0 win at Falkirk on Friday.

McCoist told the club's official website: 'I'm not sure Cammy has actually dislocated his shoulder. There is a problem with it though and he has seen the specialist about it.

'He was reasonably happy with him and he's going for scan. He seems a lot better and has a far greater range of movement than he had.

'Cammy will give me a call once he has been in and I'd be hopeful of good news rather than anything too bad.

'Considering we've not had a report on the scan yet, we don't know how long he'll be out for but we'll have a far better idea of where we are later on.

'I know from Cammy's view, having spoken to him this morning on the phone, that he feels a whole lot better.
