A construction worker was killed and a tractor-trailer driver injured when an interstate overpass undergoing demolition collapsed in Cincinnati, fire and emergency medical officials said on Tuesday.  

The overpass - part of an off-ramp in Camp Washington, Cincinnati - collapsed around 10.30pm on Monday. 

The body of the dead worker, who has not yet been named, was removed around 3am on Tuesday. Airbags were used by rescue crews to lift the tons of concrete debris off his body.

Crystal Hargett, of Bracken County, told Cincinnati.com that her husband Billy's best friend had been killed.

Mr Hargett was on the bridge and watched his friend fall to his death when the overpass collapsed.

Mrs Hargett said the victim leaves a fiancée and four children, three of them under the age of nine.

She also said that her husband and his friend normally worked the daytime shift but that the demolition work was the only reason that they were on night shift this week.

The driver of a tractor-trailer crashed into the estimated 100 tons of concrete as it hit the ground. He was taken to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center with minor injuries.

Police Chief Jeff Blackwell called it a workplace accident, saying crews were taking down the old bridge when something went 'terribly wrong'. 

'The big-rig driver is very lucky; in a matter of seconds his fate would have probably been different,' Blackwell said. 

Emergency crews were searching beneath the underpass - which was undergoing demolition at the time - for any more victims, officials said. 

The southbound I-75 in that area has been closed 'indefinitely' during the cleanup.

Speaking to WLWT, Andre Brewster, who was nearby when the collapse occurred, said: 'I heard, like, a real big 'boom'... I kinda knew right then and there that maybe something had collapsed or fallen.'

In a Twitter Post, Cincinnati fire officials confirmed at least one death, saying: '75 command confirms 1 injury of big rig driver, 1 fatality of a construction worker, 75 will be closed indefinitely.' 

Rescue workers worked through the night on Tuesday to remove the trapped body of the construction worker who was killed when an off-ramp collapsed in Cincinnati, Ohio

In reference to the victim, who is yet to be named, they added: 'Crews are working now to determine a plan of action to remove the worker, it will be a long operation.'

The construction worker's position at the time of the collapse remains unknown. 

EB I-74 at Beekman Street is also closed due to the collapse, according to WCPO. 

Both areas could be shut for up to 48 hours, officials said. Drivers have been told to plan accordingly.

Police have told reporters the incident was likely related to construction on the roadway. However, there is not yet word on an official cause. An extended recovery operation is underway.
