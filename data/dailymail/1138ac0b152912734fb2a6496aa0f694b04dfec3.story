Having hundreds of Facebook friends may seem like the ultimate sign of popularity and happiness, yet it could actually suggest the opposite.

Researchers from Maine compared personality traits to levels of happiness among more than 16,000 people over a four-year period.

People listed as extroverted at the start of the study gradually saw an increase in wellbeing, but as this wellbeing and happiness increased, the same participants became more introverted and withdrawn.

Researchers compared personality traits to levels of well-being in 16,367 participants. People who were more outgoing at the start of the four-year study saw increased levels of happiness. Yet as this happiness increased, the outgoing participants became more introverted, and withdrawn

A 2012 study by Wake Forest University 
found introverts experience greater happiness when they 
act more extroverted.

While follow-up studies found that introverts have an 
exaggerated fear of embarrassment from acting like an extrovert.

Researchers from Ohio recently found that a profile photo on Facebook tells friends, or potential friends, all they need to know to form an impression of someone and virtually no words are necessary.

In one experiment, college students who viewed a Facebook photo of a fellow student having fun with friends rated that person as extroverted - even if his profile said he was 'not a big people-person.'

The only exception is when a photo is out of the ordinary or shows someone in a negative light. In that case, people do use profile text to help interpret what kind of person is shown in the profile.

This suggests having lots of friends can ultimately make people less sociable, and can increase sadness - the opposite of what the researchers expected. 

Lead author Professor Christopher Soto added this could be because the participants felt they no longer needed to seek out new relationships.

Professor Soto, from Colby College, analysed personality traits and well-being among 16,367 participants who were surveyed repeatedly over four years.

He was able to examine which aspects of personality at the start of the study predicted which patterns of well-being later on, and whether wellbeing at the start was linked to later personality changes.

The results showed that people 'who were initially extraverted, agreeable, conscientious, and emotionally stable subsequently increased in well-being.'

But they also revealed that people with high levels of well-being to begin with 'subsequently became more agreeable, conscientious, emotionally stable, and introverted.'

Increased introversion for happy people was the opposite of what had been expected because higher extraversion usually leads to greater future happiness.

The findings suggests having lots of friends in real-life, and on social networks such as Facebook, can ultimately make people less sociable, and increase sadness. The study claims this could be because the participants felt they no longer needed to seek out new relationships

It suggests that the influence of personality on well-being was ‘somewhat stronger’ than well-being on personality, yet both were significant when forming relationships.

Links observed in the study were also likely to grow stronger over longer periods, Professor Soto suggested.

‘Even small changes to an individual’s personality traits or subjective well-being can have important consequences for the course of his or her life,’ he said.

‘These findings challenge the common assumption that associations of personality traits with subjective well-being are entirely, or almost entirely, due to trait influences on well-being,’ Professor Soto concluded.

The study was published in the Journal of Personality.

They believe this is because people don't feel the need to make new friends
