Accused: Naeem Williams allegedly whipped his daughter with a belt and made her eat her feces

A former soldier accused of killing his five-year-old daughter kicked her so hard that he left a boot imprint on her chest, prosecutors have said at the opening of his murder trial.

Naeem Williams, 34, appeared in court in Honolulu, Hawaii, near to where he was based at Wheeler Army Air Force Base, for the first day of the trial on Tuesday morning.

He is accused of inflicting seven months of abuse on his daughter Talia - including making her eat her own feces and tying her to a bed before beating her with a belt - before killing her in 2005.

On Tuesday, federal prosecutors said Talia died after the blow to the chest forced her to smack her head on the floor of her father's home.

Federal prosecutor Darren W.K. Ching told jurors that the kick to her chest was so hard that it left an imprint and caused her left shoulder to separate, the Hawaii Star Advertiser reported.

Defense lawyer John Phillipsborn said Williams admits to beating his daughter on the day she died, but argued that her previous injuries were suffered at the hands of her stepmother Delilah Williams.

Delilah Williams pleaded guilty in a deal
 with prosecutors to testify against her former partner in exchange for a
 20-year sentence. Ching said she will provide a 'firsthand
 account of abuse'.

If he is found guilty, Naeem Williams faces the death penalty 
even though Hawaii abolished capital punishment in the 1950s.

But because Williams was in the Army at the time of the death and because it occurred in military housing, it is being prosecuted by the federal government, so the death penalty could be given.

On Tuesday, Ching spent about an 
hour telling jurors disturbing details of the alleged abuse, including a
 neighbor overhearing Williams commanding his daughter to eat her feces.

Williams
 also allegedly whipped Talia with a belt while she was duct-taped to a 
bedpost and allegedly hit her so hard with a plastic ruler nicknamed 
'Mr. Paddle' that it broke.

She died in July 2005 after she was brought to a hospital unresponsive, vomiting and covered in bruises, and a criminal complaint afterwards said Williams beat her for urinating on herself.

Federal investigators saod that military
 law enforcement agents found blood splatters on the walls of the apartment from when the little girl was whipped by her father's belt.

An autopsy reported that she died from an inflicted head injury due to battered-child syndrome.

Defense attorney John Philipsborn showed jurors a grainy, 
black-and-white photograph that was taken several months before Talia's death and
 soon after the birth of her half-sister.

'This photograph is a photograph of a tragedy in progress,' he said.

Other expected witnesses in the trial will include Talia's former teacher at Wheeler Elementary School, the family's former neighbors and the medical examiner.

Naeem Williams also will take the stand, Philipsborn told the jury.

Philipsborn said Williams was ill-equipped to care for a child, let alone a child with special needs who had bowel- and bladder-control problems.

He added that Naeem Williams was married to a controlling, angry and volatile woman.

'You will understand from Naeem Williams he had both strengths and limitations,' Philipsborn said.

Talia's biological mother, Tarshia Williams, is also expected to testify. Ching said Tarshia Williams and Talia's 
father weren't married but share the same last name because they are 
distant relatives.

She filed a civil lawsuit against the government over Talia's death but it has been put on hold until after the criminal trial.

It claims that the military failed to report that Talia's father and stepmother 'abused and tortured' her even after childcare professionals reported alleged abuse.

Delilah Williams also allegedly told co-workers it was 'okay to whip a child, just don't leave any marks' and in June 2005, military police failed to tell social workers that Talia was found 'naked and mute, standing near faeces on the floor' with marks covering her body and scratches on her face.
