After Britain shivered and froze over the weekend under a layer of its first snowfall, today autumn fought back with one final burst of vivid red before winter sets in.

Stunning photographs taken at sunrise this morning show that parts of the UK have now thawed after sub-zero temperatures meant for several days it was colder here than in Moscow.

Rich red colours burst out of pictures taken in Northumberland and Birmingham this morning as warmer weather fought back.

But despite the bright scenes today, they may be short-lived as much of this week is likely to be a 'miserable' washout, with gales, rain and more snow setting in some spots.

Today was a marked contrast from the weekend, much warmer and brighter after the UK was suffering 'exceptional cold', according to the Met Office.

Snow settled in Scotland and the north of England. The Cairngorms in the Highlands of Scotland was hit hardest, with -7.3C.

England's coldest place on Sunday was Bridgefoot in Cumbria, where temperatures fell to -3.5C.

Parts of London, Essex, Berkshire and Hertfordshire also saw snowfall. 
Snow that far south in October is a 'one in one hundred years event', 
according to The Weather Outlook.

Planes were delayed by up to three hours at Stansted Airport and 
flurries were reported at London City Airport, while up to two inches of
snow fell in Scotland, Newcastle and parts of Yorkshire.

Meanwhile it is being predicted that Britain could have an incredibly cold winter.

Weathermen fanned fears of a repeat of the December 2010 big freeze by revealing indications for more high pressure cutting off mild Atlantic air. This pattern allows Arctic plunges and caused -22C Christmas 2010 chill and weeks of transport chaos.

The Met Office still produces long-range forecasts - but stopped publicising them after 2009’s non-existent “BBQ summer” blunder.

Forecasters said they were briefing their winter outlook to the Cabinet Office, headed by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, as well as transport leaders, councils and emergency services.

More snow could fall than last winter, which was much drier than average in England. This winter shows a 'preference' for average precipitation levels, meaning more moisture-carrying clouds dumping snow if temperatures tumble.

There is little hope of a repeat of last year’s mildest winter since 2007-08. Ocean warmth has plunged, with the ‘El Nino’ effect weakening and warm north Atlantic temperatures falling, the forecast said.

The Met Office said its winter forecast is more accurate than ever, after a study showed a new computer programme spots extreme cold patterns missed by the old system. Study author David Fereday said: 'Investment in science is yielding results.'

Government meteorologists said their winter outlook was based on forecast models, past observations and 'expert forecaster judgement.'

Councils have put thousands of extra staff on winter snow-clearing standby as UK salt stocks nudge a record three million tonnes, beating last winter’s 2.75million.

A DfT spokesman said: 'The transport sector is prepared.' Scotland’s Transport Minister Keith Brown said: 'I’m confident we can keep Scotland moving.'

British Weather Services has forecast a colder-than-average winter with “significant” snow, -18C temperatures and transport disruption.
