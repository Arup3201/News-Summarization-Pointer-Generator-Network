Rugby league commentator Steve 'Blocker' Roach has been sacked by 2GB Radio after he reportedly bullied a younger colleague.

Mr Roach was involved in a verbal spat with another staff member of his radio program Continuous Call, before the coverage of a match on August 15.

The high profile NRL commentator berated the younger employee, who later submitted a bullying complaint to Macquarie Radio HR.

MacquarIe Radio confirmed Roach, 52, was given the boot on Thursday, but failed to give an explanation of why his contract was terminated so abruptly.

'I can confirm that his contract has been terminated,' Macquarie Radio executive chairman Russel Tate told AAP. 'There will be no further comments from the company, or from me.'

Roach was contacted but refused to speak about being sacked. 'I don't want to talk about it now,' he said.

When the usually chatty commentator was asked how he felt about the incident , he replied: 'How do you think?'

Continuous Call co-host Darryl Brohman said he was present for the incident in the radio box but didn't want to comment further.

The prop forward played 206 games for Balmain, represented Australia 19 times and New South Wales on 17 occasions.
