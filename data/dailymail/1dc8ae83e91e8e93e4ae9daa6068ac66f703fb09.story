The Queen's cousin The Duke of Kent lay a wreath at a remembrance service today just weeks after suffering a stroke. 

The 77-year-old was taken ill in March and treated at a London hospital. 

But today Prince Michael joined his comrades - fellow Scots Guards veterans - for their annual 'Black Sunday' remembrance march from Wellington Barracks, in London, to lay a wreath at the Guards Memorial.

Last month Buckingham Palace confirmed the duke had suffered a 'mild stroke' but that it was 'not thought to be serious'. 

The duke is the son of the late Prince George, the fourth son of the Queen's grandfather King George V.

He inherited his title following the death of his father in a plane crash in 1942.

The duke is president of the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club and presents the trophies at the Wimbledon competition every year. 

He has also been president of the charity Stroke Association for the past 20 years.

The Duke of Kent graduated from Sandhurst in 1955 as a Second Lieutenant in the Royal Scots Greys. 

He then served with his regiment at home and overseas in a military career that spanned 21 years.

Following a tour in Hong Kong in 1962-63, he attended the Army staff course in 1966 and then served on the staff in Eastern Command.

In 1970 he commanded a squadron of his regiment serving in Cyprus as part of the United Nations force.

The Duke retired from the Army in 1976 with the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. He was subsequently promoted to Field Marshal in June 1993.

The Duke retains close links to the Army. He holds a number of senior appointments, and visits his regiments on a regular basis, including travelling to Iraq in 2006 to meet members of the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers and in 2008 to Afghanistan and Iraq to meet members of the Scots Guards.
