Soldiers from Chad armed with rocket propelled grenades, armoured vehicles and assault rifles have crossed into neighbouring Nigeria to battle the growing menace of Boko Haram.

Photos taken from the country's east show the heavily armed Chadian soldiers standing before destroyed vehicles and mangled corpses of the Islamist militants.

But in a brutal reprisal, Boko Haram fighters have raided more than a dozen villages near the border with Cameroon, where scores of militants shot and hacked residents to death.

Hundreds of residents fled across the border into Cameroon, prompting Chad - part of a regional coalition against the Islamists - to respond by bombarding rebel positions.

'They targeted  mainly Shuwa tribesmen, who are from the same ethnic group as a large number of the Chadian troops,' said Adum Walfannea, himself a Shuwa Arab, from Anguduram village.

Kurso Khala, who fled one of the worst-affected villages, Mudu, said the militants besieged a local market and blocked all but one entrance.

'They would ask if a person is Kanuri or Shuwa before asking him to go,' said Khala by telephone from Fotokol, across the border from the Nigerian town of Gamboru in the far north of Cameroon.

'Once a person was identified as Shuwa‎ he would be shot in the back as soon as he stepped out of the market entrance to leave.'

Walfannea and Imar Koshnana, from Musiye village, both said the death toll from the attacks could be high but there was no official confirmation of numbers.

News of the raids comes as Nigeria's military trumpets its success in recapturing several towns from Boko Haram and after President Goodluck Jonathan said the 'tide had turned' against the militants.

Details were slow to emerge because the insurgents have destroyed telecom masts since the insurgency began in 2009.

The attacks follow the Chadian ground and aerial offensive against Boko Haram enclaves  that began on February 17 after troops seized the strategic town of Dikwa.

Residents said Boko Haram suffered heavy casualties in the Chadian attacks, which were near the group's Sambisa Forest stronghold, where they have long had camps.

One resident from the herding village of Gonori near Gamboru, Umar Sanda, said troops fought back after Boko Haram stole more than 400 cattle and killed four residents in a pre-dawn raid on Tuesday.

'For more than two hours we kept hearing sounds of gunfire and explosions,' he added. 'The Chadian troops killed scores of the Boko Haram gunmen and recovered our cattle.'

Meanwhile, Nigeria's army chief said that residents displaced from Baga town in the country's northeast should be able to return to vote in March elections after the military reclaimed the town.

Lieutenant General Kenneth Minima spoke to journalists Wednesday in Maiduguri after he said he visited the town on Lake Chad in northeastern Nigeria, near the borders of Chad, Niger and Cameroon.

Minima said that Nigeria's army would take back more towns from the Islamic extremists.

'From today it is never again for insurgents to take hold of any of our territory. I told them that today it is going to be victory all the way because the war is almost ended. From here we move to retake Gwoza, Marte and Madagali,' he said.

He said he was confident that it was 'achievable to end the Boko Haram activities very soon,' and that residents who have been displaced should be able to return to their homes for March 28 presidential elections.

Boko Haram, which denounces democracy as a corrupt Western concept, has warned it will disrupt the elections with attacks.

Neighboring countries increasingly have been drawn into Nigeria's 5-year Islamic uprising, which has killed thousands and driven 1.6 million people from their homes, including across borders into Cameroon, Niger and Chad.

Boko Haram has been recruiting fighters in all three countries.

Cameroon officials said that its prisons, especially at its border with Nigeria, are overcrowded with suspected Boko Haram members.

Maroua Central Prison registrar Ngeh Emmanuel said that 30,000 people have been detained in 25 prisons in Cameroon since May 2014, up from 22,000 detained before that.

More soldiers are needed to stop inmates from endless attempts to break out of jail, he said.
