The investigation into the death of a New Orleans stripper whose dismembered body was found in Mississippi is now being handled by Louisiana authorities.

Authorities found the stabbed torso of Jaren Lockhart, 22, washed up in Mississippi's Hancock County in June 2012, NOLA reported at the time. Her decapitated head and parts of her legs were found in nearby Harrison County.

Authorities were able to identify Lockhart based on her neck tattoos. Her fiance reported her missing after she did not return from a shift at a Bourbon Street club.

Victim: Jaren Lockhart, 22, was found dismembered in June 2012 by Mississippi authorities

What happened? The 22-yaer-old mother, pictured, was reported missing after she did not return home from her shift as a New Orleans dancer on Bourbon Street

The investigation is now being handled by the Kenner police department and the Jefferson Parish District Attorney's Office, Glenn Grannan, a lead investigator for Hancock County, told WAFB.

'The new information, from a circumstantial point, indicates a higher probability that the killing happened in Kenner,' Grannan said. 'The evidence was strong enough to convince the District Attorney, which is huge.'

Terry 
Speaks and Margaret Sanchez were the last two people to see Lockhart 
alive. They were seen on surveillance video walking with Lockhart down a
 street, NOLA reported in 2012.

The search continues: Kenner police and the Jefferson Parish District Attorney's Office continue to investigate the death of Jaren Lockhart, pictured, who was found dismembered in June 2012

Both were briefly held before they were released. Sanchez was released due to a lack of evidence, the Associated Press reports, and Speaks is currently in a New York prison for an unrelated charge.

Grannan told the wire service that Sanchez has since moved from Louisiana and that Speaks was questioned several months ago.

'Turning it over to Kenner is the logical thing to do,' he said. Grannan said that both Hancock County and the FBI will continue to assist investigators.
