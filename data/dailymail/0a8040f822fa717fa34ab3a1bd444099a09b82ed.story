MoD civil servant Bernard Gray is getting a new £90,000 a year communications chief at a time the military is cutting troop numbers

A leading figure in the Ministry of Defence is to get his own £90,000-a-year spin doctor at a time when the forces are facing widespread cuts.

The MoD is recruiting a new assistant for Bernard Gray, the £200,000-a-year civil servant who was appointed to help bring down the military budget.

It comes as the army undertakes a seven-year plan to cut 20,000 military personnel from its numbers in a bid to save money.

The new communications chief will be in charge of lobbying parliament and PR for the new Defence Equipment and Support arm of the Ministry of Defence.

The new boss's salary is equivalent to the starting wage of five regular soldiers, who start on £17,945 according to the army's website.

The government is cutting troop numbers in the regular army from 102,000 to 82,000 by 2020, with some of the shortfall being made up by a newly renamed Army Reserve, formerly the Territorial Army.

The news has been branded an 'absolute disgrace' by the Pension Justice for Troops group, which is fighting the current cuts and pensions changes on behalf of forces families and ex-servicemen and women.

A spokesman told MailOnline: 'Surely if MoD policies are well planned, above board and executed fairly they should stand up to public scrutiny without the need for spin?

'This smacks of the MoD trying to cover its own back while stabbing long-serving serving personnel in theirs, by shortchanging them of the pensions they have earned and deserved.'

The Sun 
this morning reported that insiders are furious at the amount being allocated for the role and government ministers 
have ordered an investigation.

The newspaper said the MoD is also paying recruiters £20,000 to track down the right candidate for the job.

over ten years, raising fears the army could become a 'hollow force'

Dia Chakravarty, Political Director at 
the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'At a time when necessary savings are 
having to be made, splashing out on not just a super-expensive 
communications role but also paying a hefty finder's fee - all at 
taxpayers' expense - is baffling.

She added: 'What people want is an effective and efficient military service, not a highly-paid communications team spinning the news.'

Mr Gray 
has been already been criticised for his spending after it emerged in 
December that he claimed more than £100,000 on expenses for his first 
year in the job.

It was reported he enjoyed 106 stays in London and Bristol hotels, for £23,000, despite 
his home being less than a 60-mile drive from both, and was also given 
an official car and chauffeur, costing the department £65,531.

The former journalist, who was a defence advisor for Tony Blair's administration, earns £220,000 a year as Chief of Defence Material after he was taken on in 2010 to help target waste in the department.

Commenting on his new spin doctor, an MoD spokesperson said: 'This position, which has existed since 2007, is responsible for a range of tasks, including internal communications, on which there will be an increased emphasis following the launch of Defence Equipment and Support as a separate trading entity.'

They said the role would be 'responsible for a team of 51 staff, only 14 of which are currently dedicated to communications'.

In December last year, General Sir Nick Houghton, Chief of the Defence Staff, said there was a huge danger Britain would have too much state-of-the-art equipment but not enough troops to man it.

In a damning assessment of government plans, he said: 'Our current course leads to a strategically incoherent force structure - exquisite equipment, but insufficient resources to man that equipment or train. It is what the Americans call the spectre of the "hollow force".'
