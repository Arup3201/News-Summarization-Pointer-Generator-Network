All charges against six British Greenpeace activists awaiting trial for protesting in the Arctic look set to be dropped after the passing of a new law in Russia.Â 

The 30-member crew of the Greenpeace ship was detained by Russian police during a protest at a floating oil rig in the Arctic.

Six British members of the group were held in prison for two months until they were finally released on bail to await their trial for hooliganism in Saint Petersburg.

But their charges could now be dropped after Russia's parliament today passed an amendment to an amnesty bill. The 26 non-Russians of the so-called Arctic 30 could now be free to return home as soon as they are given exit visas by the authorities.

Released: Anthony Perrett, from Newport in South Wales, was arrested by Russian authorities during a Greenpeace protest in the Arctic - he was freed on bail after spending two months in detention

Finally free: Philip Ball from Oxford was the final British Greenpeace activist to be released from jail in Russia

Britons Philip Ball, from Oxford; Anthony Perrett, from Newport in 
south Wales; freelance journalist Kieron Bryan; Alexandra Harris, from 
Exeter; Iain Rogers, from Devon, and Frank Hewetson, from London, may now get to spend Christmas at home.

But Greenpeace said it was not yet clear when the group will be allowed home, or what will happen to its vessel the Arctic Sunrise, which has remained impounded in Murmansk since the arrests.

Ana Paula Maciel from Brazil, one of the activists, said: 'I'm relieved, but I'm not celebrating. I spent two months in jail for a crime I didn't commit and faced criminal charges that were nothing less than absurd. But now at last it seems like this saga could soon be over and it may not be long before we're back with our families.

'Right now, my thoughts are with our Russian colleagues. If they accept this amnesty, they will have criminal records in the country where they live, and all for something they didn't do. All because we stood up for Arctic protection.'

Arctic Sunrise captain Peter Wilcox, of the United States, said: 'I might soon be going home to my family, but I should never have been charged and jailed in the first place. We sailed north to bear witness to a profound environmental threat but our ship was stormed by masked men wielding knives and guns.

'Now it's nearly over and we may soon be truly free, but there's no amnesty for the Arctic.

'We may soon be home, but the Arctic remains a fragile global treasure under assault by oil companies and the rising temperatures they're driving. We went there to protest against this madness. We were never the criminals here.'

Russia's state duma voted 446-0 in favour of the amnesty bill, which mainly concerns first-time offenders, juveniles and women with small children.

But the amnesty was also extended to suspects of hooliganism who are still awaiting trial, which means the charges against 30 people aboard the Greenpeace ship are likely to be dropped.

The carefully tailored bill, which 
would also see the release of members of the Pussy Riot punk band, 
Nadezhda Tolokonnikova and Maria Alekhina, has been largely perceived as
 the Kremlin's attempt to soothe the West's criticism of its human 
rights record ahead of the Winter Olympics in Sochi next year.

Despite
 the expansion of the bill, it is still drawing criticism because it 
does not cover former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who has been 
widely described as Russia's main political prisoner, and only eight out
 of 26 defendants who took part in a 2012 protest rally on the Bolotnaya
 square in Moscow that ended in scuffles between protesters and riot 
police.

Opposition lawmaker Dmitry Gudkov said the amnesty bill 'has buried all hopes of human rights activists and families of political prisoners that their children and family members will be set free'.

The amnesty could happen as soon as Thursday, when the bill is expected to be published in the government newspaper. But it allows a six-month period to carry out the amnesty, meaning that some of the prisoners could in theory wait weeks or months before getting released.

Lawyers and families of the Pussy Riot members insist that everyone eligible for the release ought to be allowed to walk free as soon as the bill is published. The two are now slated to be released in March.

'We're hoping that in case the bill gets passed, Nadia and Masha will be released on Thursday,' Pyotr Verzilov, Tolokonnikova's husband, told The Associated Press. 'There's nothing to stop this.'
