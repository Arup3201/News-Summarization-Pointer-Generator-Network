Denial: Sir Burce Keogh insists a two-tier A&E system does not mean a cut in services

The disturbing truth of what really happens when ‘super A&Es’ are  created is today exposed by The Mail on Sunday.

Our research has found that:

The country’s top doctor has said costly staff and equipment should be concentrated in 40 to 70 Major Emergency Centres.

Professor Sir Bruce Keogh, Medical Director of the NHS, said last week it was ‘complete nonsense’ that downgrading smaller A&Es would be the price to pay for turning bigger ones into super-centres.

And he argued sending the  most seriously ill directly to super A&Es, bypassing local units, would save lives.

But The Mail on Sunday – which has vigorously highlighted the danger to patients of A&E ‘rationalisation’ – has found that recent moves to centralise A&Es have led to local cuts. The remaining emergency hospitals have frequently been overwhelmed with sick patients.

Across England there are 197 A&E departments. Sir Bruce insists his plan will not mean cuts. He claims evidence shows rationalising the number that deal with serious heart attacks, strokes and life-threatening injuries will lead to ‘vastly increased survival’ for patients.

Sir Bruce said last week: ‘This has been described on the one hand as a two-tier system or on the other as a downgrading of a lot of A&Es. This is complete nonsense.’

But in the North-East, centralising A&E services at North Tees Hospital in Stockton triggered the eventual loss of all emergency facilities in Hartlepool, bar the town’s out-of-hours GP service and a nurse-led minor injuries unit.

What’s more, when health bosses closed
 Hartlepool’s A&E in 2011, they stated the local hospital would 
retain its Emergency Assessment Unit. A reassuring leaflet said the EAU 
had: ‘A highly skilled team of doctors, nurses and other health 
professionals who are specially trained to deal with patients with 
serious medical problems.’

The EAU was particularly important to the town’s 15,000 pensioners – whose numbers will swell by 50 per cent by 2030. 

But last month, after a three-month ‘consultation’, it was closed and relocated to North Tees  Hospital – a total of 13 miles away. Hartlepool also lost 120 emergency beds to North Tees.

Local councillor Keith Fisher said: ‘I did warn that the hospital would lose more of its services if the A&E closed. Some people didn’t believe me. The hospital board made promises and then broke them.’

He claimed: ‘If you dig down, what you find with “centralisation” is a cheaper service, not a better one.’

At least the area kept its emergency beds.

When managers closed the Emergency Medical Centre at Wycombe Hospital, in Buckinghamshire in October 2012, they jettisoned 73 of its 153 medical beds. The centre – which had essentially been an A&E which did not take trauma patients – was downgraded to Urgent Care Centre because it did not have enough consultants.

A&E services were centralised at Aylesbury’s Stoke Mandeville Hospital. But Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust decided not to move the beds to Stoke Mandeville as it could ‘cope’ with the existing 132. It meant that across the two sites, one in four emergency beds was lost.

Managers argued: ‘We expect the number of beds [at Stoke Mandeville] to remain unchanged, as we will continue to reduce the hospital length of stay with greater use of our recently developed community services. This will allow us to cope with the increased number of admissions within the existing number of beds.’

But The Mail on Sunday has been contacted by many patients who have spent hours in Stoke Mandeville A&E as there were no beds free.

Wexham Park Hospital in Slough, which, like Stoke Mandeville, is 14 miles from Wycombe, has also been hit by the fallout. From Wycombe the route to Stoke Mandeville is along a winding A-road, while most of the way to Wexham Park is on the M40. Yet NHS planners thought Wexham Park would get only 2,500 of Wycombe’s emergency patients a year, while Stoke Mandeville would get 13,500.

Nine months before the Wycombe 
closure, Wexham chief executive Philippa Slinger wrote that the change 
might have ‘an impact’ on her hospital although she said this would 
‘likely be towards the end of the year’.

Nonetheless,
 £2.5 million was put aside to upgrade Wexham Park’s A&E. But by 
March 2013 only £150,000 of that money had been spent by deeply indebted
 Heatherwood and Wexham Park NHS Foundation Trust, board papers show.

The
 consequences have been borne by patients and overstretched staff. Like 
all A&Es, Wexham Park is meant to treat 95 per cent of patients in 
four hours – but in the year after Wycombe closed, it only reached that 
benchmark for three weeks out of 52.

In January, executives were forced to admit they had an ‘acute shortage of escalation capacity’ – the whole hospital was too full. They drew up a ‘Remedial Action Plan’ for the A&E and built two quick-fix ‘modular wards’ containing 28 beds.

A&E overcrowding continued and in mid-April almost three in 10 patients were having to wait four hours or more.

Heatherwood and Wexham Park Trust failed to respond when asked to comment. A spokesman for Buckinghamshire Healthcare NHS Trust said that the number of medical beds at Wycombe was cut by 73, but that 20 additional beds were eventually put in at Stoke Mandeville. She said £5 million had been invested in Stoke Mandeville’s A&E.

A spokesman for North Tees & Hartlepool NHS Trust said in 2011 the plan had been to keep the EAU at Hartlepool until a new hospital was built at Wynyard in 2014. However, she said the EAU had to be removed sooner because the Wynard project had been delayed and rising clinical standards forced centralisation sooner.

An NHS England spokesman said: ‘Our recommendations do not suggest the downgrading of A&E departments. Any suggestion that this is the case is to completely misunderstand what we have said.’

Seven A&E units across England have been closed – or ‘downgraded’ – since 2007. And right now, another 15 face downgrading or losing key facilities.

But senior NHS figures believe as many as 60 could go.

NHS England medical director Professor Sir Bruce Keogh claims downgrading smaller units is not part of his super A&E plan.

But as we reveal today, recent evidence shows boosting one hospital’s A&E tends to go hand-in-hand with cutting facilities at another.

In addition, decisions about how to reorganise A&E services will be largely down to local NHS organisations. NHS England will only oversee ‘the big picture’.

Our analysis shows eight of the current 15 facing closure or losing facilities are in London – about a third of all A&Es inside the M25.

Last week, Dr Mark Spencer, medical director for service design and quality for NHS England in London, said he thought that scale of change was needed nationwide.

He said his guess was that ‘there will be a 20 or 30 per cent reduction’ in A&Es taking blue-light ambulances across the country.

If that happened, up to 60 of England’s 197 A&Es will be affected. However, Sir Bruce has made clear that what works in cities will not necessarily work in rural areas.
