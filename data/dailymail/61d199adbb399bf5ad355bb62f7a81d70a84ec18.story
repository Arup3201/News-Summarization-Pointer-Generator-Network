These adorable billies are definitely for the fainthearted.

Myotonic goats, or 'fainting goats', have a genetic disorder called myotonia congenital which causes their muscles to tighten when they get startled.

They drop to the ground and are stiff as a board for about 10 seconds, if shocked by strangers, loud noises or anything else.

 Lancaster, Pennsylvania, has bred fainting goats for almost 20 years and sells them to buyers on America's East Coast.

But it's only recently that her adorable herd has been noticed, after hilarious footage of her goats went viral.

'I didn't think my claim to fame would be my fainting goats. I am called the Crazy Goat Lady by many just because I love my goats,' she told ABC affiliate WHTM.

'(MTV) are going to put it on their show called Ridiculousness we were also contacted by the BBC and provided some footage for their show which is called the world's weirdest animals.'

Although her goats have a genetic disorder, Ellis said the unique breed is living the good life.

'Their uniqueness, people like to have the fainting goats, and they get treated like dogs or cats,' Ellis said.

'They get a really good life. We just fell in love with them, they are the perfect goat in our eyes.'
