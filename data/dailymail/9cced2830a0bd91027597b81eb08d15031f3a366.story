Kittens have been paralysed, had their skulls broken and had ­electrodes stuck onto their brains, ribs and spine as part of a series of shocking experiments at 10 of the country's most prestigious universities.

The cruel procedures on the helpless subjects have been performed so scientists can improve their understanding of the human body.

Some of the animals were raised in complete darkness while others had one of their eyes stitched closed so scientists could analyse problems surrounding 'lazy eye'.

Others had their lungs deliberately collapsed during the brutal procedures and many were injected with paralysing drugs to stop them moving or breathing.

Horrifying: Kittens had their skulls cracked open before electrodes were inserted into their brain. This picture was taken during a similar procedure at the University of Wisconsin

Brutal: Scientists put the kittens under anaesthetic but when the procedures were finished, most of the cats were given fatal overdoses. Animal charity PETA captured these images at Wisconsin University last year

Scientists put the kittens under anaesthetic but when the experiments were finished, most of them were killed.

In a document seen by Mail Online, 10 universities including Cambridge were listed as having performed the controversial tests.

University College London gave adult cats anaesthetic before screwing plates into their skull while they were placed face down.

Electrodes were then attached to their spine to 'investigate how abdominal nerve cells and muscles work together to allow for normal respiration, coughing and breathing.'

To test 'feedback mechanisms' between the eyes and the brain, they placed electrodes onto certain areas of the brain after removing parts of their skull.

The University of Bristol purposely bred cats for their experiments, which involved 'cutting through the skin and bone to gain access to the skull.'

Some of the food regimes, which lasted for six weeks, were high in fat and harmful.

Cardiff University and University of Edinburgh raised kittens and their mothers in 'complete darkness' to test how certain brain functions related to amblyopia, commonly known as ‘lazy eye’.

Some kittens were raised normally and then placed in complete darkness for a week. Other kittens had one eye closed through the use of sutures in the eyelids for up to seven days.

Major head surgery was done to prepare the kittens for testing. They were then anaesthetised and paralysed with a drug which prevented them from breathing or moving.

A hole was made through their throats into their tracheas (wind pipe) so that a tube could be inserted and used to artificially 'breathe' for them.

The Royal Veterinary College is also said to be 'directly involved' in the experiments.

Animal campaigners have reacted angrily to the revelations with one calling the procedures 'repulsive'.

Andrew
 Tyler, the director of Animal Aid said: 'The extreme suffering and 
stress endured by the cats and kittens used in these repulsive 
experiments is deeply disturbing to imagine.

'Quite
 apart from the suffering caused, these appalling procedures are highly 
unlikely to contribute to medical progress, since the results of animal 
experiments cannot be reliably translated to humans.

'Instead
 of torturing cats and kittens in perversely cruel experiments, 
University College London should move into the twenty-first century and 
embrace the wide range of non-animal methods that are available to 
scientists and produce valid, human-relevant results.'

The shocking treatment of the kittens was outlined in a report by the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection (BUAV).

CEO of the BUAV, Michelle Thew, said: 
'Over 5 million families in the UK share their home with one or more 
cats yet these much loved animals are still being used in cruel 
experiments in which they can be subjected to invasive brain surgery or 
deliberately deprived of light or vision by being raised in total 
darkness or by having their eyelids sewn shut.

'Much
 of the research is fundamental and the BUAV believes that sophisticated
 alternative techniques, which do not involve animal suffering, should 
be used instead. We are calling on the Government to end the cruel use 
of cats in UK laboratories.'

Comedian and author, Alexei Sayle, who is campaigning with the BUAV, will deliver report titled ‘What is happening to cats?’ to the Home Office.

Mr Sayle said: 'As a cat owner myself I
 know what wonderful companions they can be and how affectionate, 
intelligent and playful.

'That
 is why I am joining with the BUAV to ask the UK Government to bring an 
end to the use of all cats in experimentation. It is time to stop this 
cruel and unnecessary suffering.'

Last year, animal charity PETA challenged the University of Wisconsin over their treatment of cats during animal testing.

The organisation managed to capture some of the animals during the procedures.

A spokesman from the University of Cambridge said: 'The research to which BUAV refers involved scientists from a number of UK institutions, including researchers from University of Cambridge, who analysed tissue samples.

'This research was part of the development of a potential new treatment for amblyopia (lazy eye), a common disorder of vision which affects one in 50 children.

'As it would be unethical to carry out such research using humans, initial studies were carried out using mice and rats; in order to further understand whether the treatment was effective, it was then necessary to carry out further work in a higher order animal – in this case a small number of cats. '

Controversial: Ten of the country's most prestigious universities were said to be involved in the procedures similar to that performed at the University of Wisconsin (pictured). Many of the cats were held down like this during the brutal experiments

A spokesman for University College London said the experiments mentioned in the article were carried out in 1992 and 1998.

Reacting to the allegations, Cardiff University spokesperson said: 'The research referenced in today’s story ended in 2010.

'Our
 research involving animals is aimed at the alleviation of human and 
veterinary disease through the advancement of medical, dental, 
biological and veterinary understanding.

'All
 animal-related research work at Cardiff University is designed and 
carried out in accordance with the principles of the 3Rs under 
veterinary oversight and in compliance with the strict conditions 
imposed by the UK Government.'

A representative from Bristol University said it could state categorically that the type of research highlighted has not been carried out at the University for at least seven years

Mail Online has contacted the other institutions for comment.
