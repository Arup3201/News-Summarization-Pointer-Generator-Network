Frank Sinatra's widow has branded Mia Farrow's claims that her son Ronan may 'possibly' have been fathered by the singer a 'bunch of junk'.

If true, Farrow's claims would mean that Ronan is not the son of her former long-term partner Woody Allen and that he would have been conceived when Barbara and Frank Sinatra were married.

But Mrs Sinatra, who was married to the singer until his death in 1998, dismissed the revelation as 'a phony deal'.

'I can't hardly believe that,' she told the Desert Sun. 'It's just a bunch of junk. There's always junk written - lies that aren't true."

Mrs Sinatra, 85, said that she had not been aware of the claims - which Farrow made in an interview with Vanity Fair - and that Ronan Farrow, now 25, had been left nothing in her late husband's estate.

Ronan, a journalist and lawyer, has also dismissed his mother's claims, writing on Twitter on Wednesday: 'Listen, we're all *possibly* Frank Sinatra's son.'

Farrow married Sinatra in 1966 in Las Vegas when she was 21 and he was 50. She told Vanity Fair that he was the great love of her life, and claimed: 'We never really split up'.

The marriage fell apart 18 months later when she refused to drop her critically-acclaimed performance in Rosemary's Baby to star in a movie with her husband. They divorced in 1968.

Two years later, Farrow married German-Austrian pianist Andre Previn. The couple adopted three children and also had three biological children before divorcing in 1979.

In 1980, Farrow started a long-term relationship with Woody Allen, although the two never lived together. Farrow became Allen's muse and starred in 13 of his films, most notable Hannah And Her Sisters in 1986.

Her relationship with Allen ended in 1992 when she discovered he was having an affair with her oldest adopted daughter, Soon-Yi Previn, then 22.

Barbara Sinatra was married to Frank Sinatra from 1976 until his death in 1998.

Vanity Fair interviewed Farrow and eight of her 14 adopted and biological children for the article.

Ronan said in the article that he is 'so proud' of his large family.

'I grew up across the table from Moses, who has cerebral palsy, and next to my sister Quincy, born of a drug-addicted inner-city mother, and Minh, who is blind,' he tells Vanity Fair.

'I could never have understood what it means to grow up blind or with cerebral palsy. I saw problems and needs, so the next thing you think is: "O.K., what are you going to do about it?", he adds.

A strained relationship with his father doesn't seem to have held Ronan back; and he has been deemed a child prodigy.

He enrolled in Bard College at the age of 11, graduating at 15, and moving on to the prestigious Yale Law School and graduating by the age of 21- a year younger than most students finish their undergraduate degree.

Since leaving school, Ronan has worked as a special advisor to the State Department, specifically focusing on the youth issues in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Denial: Ronan Farrow also dismissed the claims by tweeting: 'We're all *possibly* be Frank Sinatra's son'

He has lent his face and name to charitable causes for years, serving as a UNICEF spokesperson from 2001 to 2009.

After working under Hillary Clinton in the State Department, Ronan is now moves into the ranks of her husband, former president Bill Clinton, with Monday's Rhodes scholarship nomination.

Farrow's adopted daughter Dylan also spoke for the first time about how she is tormented by 'crippling' fears over her alleged abuse at the hands of Woody Allen - abuse he denies ever occured.

But Dylan Farrow reveals that she refuses to ever say her famous adopted fatherâ€™s name and admitted: 'I'm scared of him, his image.'

Of the claims about Ronan's parentage, a representative for Woody Allen told 
The Associated Press: 'The article is so fictitious and extravagantly 
absurd that he is not going to comment.'
