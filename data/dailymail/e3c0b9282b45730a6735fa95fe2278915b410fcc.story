Leaving Mum in hospital at the end of visiting hours was like being wrenched from a terrified child. This warm, capable, intelligent woman - a former domestic science teacher - had borne years of living with terminal cancer with stoicism and dignity. But two dreadful weeks on a hectic hospital ward had reduced her to a confused and anguished wreck.

Even now, it's almost unbearable to recall my mother gasping inconsolably down the phone: 'You have to come, you have to come.' Or her pinched, pleading looks each time my hospital visits came to an end.

If those had been my last memories of Mum, I don't know how I would have coped. So many people do die like this - but our family was lucky, because Mum was able to move into a Sue Ryder hospice.

Memories: Audrey with daughter Philippa on her wedding day, they had time to reminisce in her final days

Our lovely mum, Audrey Cole, passed away aged 77 more than a year ago, and the loss is still raw. But when dark moments of grief threaten to take hold, I remind myself how the last two weeks of her life, thanks to the hospice, were among the happiest times we'd ever shared together.

It sounds bizarre, I know. But free from anguish, no longer distracted by pain, and cocooned in a place where she felt safe and secure, Mum was extraordinarily content - even though her life was ebbing away. It meant we could make every last moment together really count.

I remember sitting in her cosy hospice room one warm afternoon, sunlight streaming through the open window, as, together with my older sister Lindsey, we pored over old family photos.

How we rocked with laughter at the sight of Dad sporting some ridiculously baggy striped shorts on a holiday to France in the Fifties. And could that be Lindsey and me, aged four and seven, trussed up in matching purple dungarees?

moment together really count

Mum wasn't afraid of dying. She'd been facing her mortality since the breast cancer she'd been diagnosed with in 1991, when she was 56, had returned ten years later with a vengeance.

Her original cancer in her right breast had been treated with a lumpectomy - but now she had secondary cancer through both breasts and in her chest.

Despite a double mastectomy and chemotherapy, the cancer was too hard to control and within a matter of months of that diagnosis in 2001, Mum was given four to 18 months to live.

We were left reeling - we were such a close family, how would we cope with losing Mum? But she never complained and accepted the prognosis with great courage, only to confound such predictions by living for another 11 years.

Missed: Philippa and her sister with their parents on their golden wedding anniversary

In a speech at my parents' golden wedding party in 2009, I jokingly castigated Mum for the fact that both my sister and I had rushed to get married when she had first been diagnosed - and, three grandchildren later, she still was here.

During ever-shortening periods of remission - sometimes as short as 18 months - she and my dad, Brian, a retired bank manager who is now 78, would seize life by the throat, taking trips to China and New England.

She was treated like an individual by nurses who were enduringly friendly and patient

Mum had no intention of going quietly. She was indomitable. When, in a cruel twist of fate, Dad was diagnosed with early stage Alzheimer's six years ago, she insisted she would look after him at home - which she did.

But in April last year, as the cancer pushed relentlessly inwards towards Mum's ribs and lungs, she had to give up caring for Dad and he was moved into respite care. Meanwhile, her doctors admitted that any further surgery would be risky and futile.

Even then she didn't weep or sink into despair, insisting we all carry on as normal.

Then, at the beginning of September, Mum was rushed to hospital with severe breathlessness. The cancer was causing her lungs to fill with fluid, and though doctors managed to drain this away, within a day or so her lungs had filled up again.

Again they were drained, only to refill. The cycle repeated itself two or three times, over several days, until one evening, after my sister and I had left the hospital, Mum’s doctors told her there was no point in repeating the procedure as her lungs were simply going to fill up again.

They were telling her there was nothing more they could do, yet they delivered the words without any compassion or empathy.

Invaluable support: Philippa will always be grateful to Sue Ryder staff

I hate to think of her hearing those chilling words alone.

She was given an oxygen tank to relieve the breathing difficulty, and that was that. The end of the road.

Frightened and isolated, she immediately called me, sobbing so bitterly I couldn't understand a word she was saying. I raced back to the hospital only to find Mum - my quiet, strong, stoic and determined mother - crying and shaking like a terrified child.

A nurse had given her a sedative and tried to explain to me what little she knew. It was three hours before a doctor came to explain Mum's medical situation, but in terms of morale and anxiety, the damage had been done - for all of us.

Over the course of the next two weeks, Mum's situation at the hospital just seemed to go from bad to worse. Lindsey and I visited every day, but we seemed to spend most of our time trying to track down nurses to tell them Mum was in pain or that her bedding needed changing because her sheets were damp with sweat.

Her basic physical needs were addressed, but the total lack of compassion and communication was so upsetting. It was clear that Mum felt utterly confused, lost. No one ever consulted her, no one told her what to expect or how long she would be there for. Matters came to a head when an elderly woman with severe breathing problems was installed in a bed directly opposite Mum.

The lady's family kept a constant vigil since it was clear she didn’t have long to live. Mum could hear every cough, gasp and dying breath. She had no choice but to be a captive audience to this unfolding tragedy. She had to watch this woman pass away.

It was then my sister and I knew we had to get her out of there. Mum insisted she wanted to die at home, a short  drive away in Potton, Bedfordshire, but in her advanced state of ill health, this wasn't possible.

In the meantime, the palliative care team contacted Sue Ryder St John's Hospice in Moggerhanger, Bedford, who readily agreed to take her.

I admit I was very nervous about what the hospice would be like, terrified that Mum would find it a morbid and frightening place filled with dying people.

Women at risk

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in the UK. Around 55,000 women are diagnosed each year

But as soon as we arrived, it was clear my fears had been entirely misplaced. The staff insisted Lindsey and I have a cup of tea while nurses gently led Mum away so they could settle her in a lovely room - her own room - overlooking the gardens.

They spent time talking about how she felt, what pain relief she needed. It created a template for those last couple of weeks of her life in which Mum finally felt she had regained control.

She was treated like an individual by nurses who were enduringly friendly and patient. Lindsey and I could come and go as we pleased. I’d often pop in with my two daughters, Rosie, nine, and Chloe, five, on the way to school. Mum loved it when the girls came running in to bring Grandma her morning paper.

The girls loved it, too: they'd been frightened by what they'd seen on the hospital ward, and had to be cajoled a little into going to the hospice. But after seeing how different it was, they were only too happy to go again.

Meanwhile, we adults rarely acknowledged the great unsaid: Mum was dying - we were going to lose her all too soon. The warmth and peacefulness of the hospice stripped us of any morbid thoughts. Instead, we talked and reminisced.

The only time Mum got agitated was discussing Dad - he was now in a home, but we reassured her he was in good hands. She also made it clear she no longer wanted to go home. She wanted to stay in the hospice until she died.

Once she was there she seemed almost to 'bounce back' - her pain was better controlled, and she slept well thanks to the peace and quiet.

Thanks to such new-found serenity, we developed a new, though all too brief, routine of just spending quality time talking to Mum. She was especially thrilled when I told her I was doing a sponsored 10km walk in aid of the hospice and had raised nearly £3,000.

She died on a bright Sunday morning on the last day of September. It was early, around 8am when I got the call. Mum had fallen trying to get out of bed - independent to the last - and though not injured, once safely and comfortably back under the covers, she simply took a long, peaceful breath and slipped away.

When Lindsey and I got to the hospice, we found Mum serenely laid out in bed, two fresh flowers on her pillow, her hands tucked under the sheets and wrapped around a little wooden cross. It was a beautiful, comforting sight.

And so, as I come to terms with losing my mum, I carry those precious two weeks of hospice care with me. I think of her sitting peacefully in her chair, doing the crossword, watching television, tucking into a hearty casserole or delicious fruit crumble.

I'm just so glad that despite all this she managed to reclaim the peace and control she so badly craved before she died. It’s the very least any of us can hope for.
