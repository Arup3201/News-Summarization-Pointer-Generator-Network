Anthony Joshua has had to scrap his plans for a London fight with Kevin Johnson this month after suffering a stress fracture in his back.

The unbeaten heavyweight was due to fight the American at the O2 Arena on January 31 in what was likely to be his toughest fight to date.

But those plans have gone up in smoke after he aggravated an old injury. His camp say he will return to action on a bill in Newcastle on April 4, stressing that the injury is not serious.

Joshua said: ‘I trained so hard over Christmas and the press conference with Johnson was so lively that I was really looking forward to putting in a great performance.

‘It’s bad news for myself and for the fans that have bought tickets. I hope to be able to put on a fan zone at the weigh-in and the fight itself to meet the fans. I will be competing many times this year but this injury is something that I need to get sorted as soon as possible.’

The O2 Arena show is scheduled to go ahead, featuring Kevin Mitchell’s world title eliminator against Daniel Estrada.

Promoter Eddie Hearn said: ‘It's disappointing to lose Anthony from this great card but after receiving news from the scan, he was left with no option but to rest his back.

‘He picked up a niggle in the (Michael) Sprott camp and had a good month rest after but it hasn't been 100 per cent in camp and the results gave him no option. He hopes to resume punching in early February and come back with a bang in Newcastle on April 4.’

The 25-year-old is unbeaten in 10 fights after winning gold at the 2012 Olympics.
