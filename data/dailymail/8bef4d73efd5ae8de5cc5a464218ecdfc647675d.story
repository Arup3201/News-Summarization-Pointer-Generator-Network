It's not helpful to race relations in America to write off unhappiness with President Barack Obama's policies as race-based animosity, Ohio Senator Rob Portman said today.

Even people who voted for Obama are disappointed, Portman told 'America's Newsroom' anchor Bill Hemmer on Fox News, 'and for good reason.'

'I don't think blaming the opposition to president Obama - which by the way is at record highs when you look at the polling data - blaming that on some sort of racial animus, I don’t think helps us,' Portman, said, responding to comments Attorney General Eric Holder said yesterday on the topic.

Portman went on to cite polling that shows that disapproval of Obama is linked to his poor handling of the economy and irritation with the 2010 health care reform law, spearheaded by the president. The Republican Senator also pointed to gridlock on Capitol Hill as another source of anxiety for many Americans.

'And so, I think there's a lot of frustration, and there's a lot of opposition and its grounded not in some sort of animus to him, but in the fact that he just can't seem to get the results people are looking for,' he said.

Yesterday Holder told ABC News that some people who disagree 'There's a certain level of vehemence, it seems to me, that's directed at me [and] directed at the president. You know, people talking about taking their country back. … There's a certain racial component to this for some people.'

'I don’t think this is the thing that is a main driver, but for some there's a racial animus,' Holder said.

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, pictured here at a news conference this morning, claimed yesterday that some people dislike he and the president because of the color of their skin

Holder said the country is 'a fundamentally better place than we were 50 years ago' and has 'made a great deal of progress.'

'But there's still more we have to travel along this road so we get to the place that is consistent with our founding ideals,' he said.

The first black Attorney General also stood by his 2009 comments that 'in things racial,' Americans 'have always been and continue to be, in too many ways, essentially a nation of cowards.'

'I wouldn't walk away from that speech,' Holder told ABC News' Pierre Thomas in an interview that aired on This Week.

'I think we are still a nation that is too afraid to confront racial issues,' he said, and to engage 'one another across the color line [to] talk about racial issues.'

Portman said he agreed with Holder that America is a better place than it was before the Civil Rights Act passed in 1964, and 'I also agree with him there’s more work to be done.'

The Republican Senator said he just couldn't get behind the Obama administration official's efforts to lump Americans who oppose the president's agenda in with racists, saying such rhetoric wasn't a 'constructive.'

'I don’t 
think it takes us in the right direction in terms of making progress on 
dealing with this eternal issue we’ve got in America, which is making 
sure we are doing everything we possibly can do to fight racism,' he said.
