A woman who suffered from crippling anorexia and survived on only Mini Weetabix and tea all day has recovered and become a dedicated runner.

Izzy Mulkerrins, 19, who was born in Ireland but now lives in Sweden, began battling an eating disorder when she was aged just 11.

Suffering from cystic fibrosis, Izzy looked for an aspect of her life she could control and her weight plummeted to just 6st 4lb, giving her a BMI of 13.

But thanks to the support of her friends and family Izzy has turned her life around and has now regularly goes running - and is planning to do a half marathon.

The student said: 'At my lowest point I would eat two Mini Weetabix, a quarter of an apple and a crispbread and around 10 black teas.

'I'd spend between two and four hours exercising each day and I'd try to do a lot of standing and walking as well.

'When I was in hospital I hit rock bottom. I realised that I couldn't keep going the way I was going.

'I wanted to live a life, I wanted to have my teenager years and to be happy and healthy.'

Izzy first started her battle with anorexia when she was 11. Her parents divorced when she was five and as she got older she began to feel she had no choice in travelling between her parents each week.

She looked for a way to control her life and turned to her diet.

She said: 'I was beginning to think about the future and it scared me a lot. I didn't know what I wanted to do with my life, I didn't know who I was or what I was doing. I felt like I had no control.

'I have always felt this need to be free and not be controlled by anyone else so I began controlling my food. I have been tall and slim my whole life and always been told I can eat lots and so not eating was a form of rebellion as well.

'I suffer from CF as well and I believe that had a very large impact on me developing an eating disorder as well. I was often sick as a child and I had no control over it.

'I went through a phase where I stopped taking my medicines in the hope of being normal, but that just made everything worse and I became more sick.'

Izzy spent almost two months in a children's psychiatric ward where she was tube fed for two weeks, and almost one and a half years in an eating disorder clinic where she was an inpatient five times and a day patient three times.

She said: 'My eating disorder thoughts and habits began when I was 11 and at 16 I was declared healthy.

Izzy's parents divorced when she was five and as she got older she began to feel she had little control

'I started treatment when I was 14, though it took me a year until I finally began to accept the help and begin recovery, and then it took me a year to recover mentally and physically.

'At my very worst I was very depressed - I saw no way out of the hell I was in. I didn't have motivation to recover either.

'I just accepted that I would always be sick because I didn't want to face my fears or my anxiety. I spent a lot of time thinking about suicide and planning suicide.

'I felt no happiness and no motivation when I was at my worst and the only thing that got me out of bed each morning was my fear of resting and being still, so I would only get up to exercise so I wouldn't gain weight.'

Izzy is now looking healthier after her illness, and is hoping to help others recover 

Since her recovery Izzy has concentrated on being happy and healthy. She has got back into running and completed a midnight run, which she has wanted to do since she was 12.

Izzy also plans to do some charity runs and a half marathon.

She said: 'I always loved running and working out so that was a motivation for me to keep going for recovery, though having exercise as the only goal to recover isn't always healthy as it can lead to an exercise addiction.

'I am now stronger than ever and what I went through made me who I am now. I would be a completely different person and be in a different situation.

'I now use my past experience to help others who are struggling though my blog - Life Without Anorexia - and I love knowing that I can help people chose life and to get through the hell of an eating disorder.

'When I was sick what I needed was someone to understand to give me advice and tell me things were going to get better, but I never got that so I'm helping others as much as I can so that they don't feel as lonely or hopeless.'
