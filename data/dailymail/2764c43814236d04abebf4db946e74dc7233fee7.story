Last year’s Champions League finalists Atletico Madrid are still in the Champions League... just.

After 120 exhausting minutes Diego Simeone’s side won on penalties with Fernando Torres scoring the home side’s last spot-kick and Stefan Kiessling missing his to put Atletico through.

The dramatic climax began with Raul Garcia blazing the first kick over the bar. Substitute goalkeeper Jan Oblak saved Hakan Calhanoglu’s awful spot-kick hit low and straight down the middle to put the Spaniards back in with a chance of progress.

Antoine Griezmann stepped up and showed everyone how penalties should be taken scoring high into the roof of the net. Simon Rolfes did likewise to level the scores and Mario Suarez scored his second goal of the night having put Atletico ahead in normal time.

When Omer Toprak put his kick nervously over the bar Atletico looked to have the finish line in sight only for Bernd Leno to save Koke’s kick.

Gonzalo Castro then scored but after Torres had snuck his penalty just inside Leno’s right hand upright Kiessling missed and the Calderon erupted with joy.

Atletico came into the game one goal down from the first leg and struggled to make in-roads early on with a Koke free-kick not really testing Leno. 

Simone’s team knew one lapse on the break would need them leaving to score three and when Son Heugn-Min was put through by Bender on 22 minutes it was his miscontrol that prevented him getting a shot on target.

As he came out to close down Son, Atletico Madrid goalkeeper Miguel Moya pulled a hamstring and had to be replaced by Oblak.

Losing their keeper and having to use a substitute so early was a major set-back for Simeone but four minutes later he was running along the touchline as Atletico Madrid took the lead.

Cani headed the ball down for Mario Suarez and his shot through the crowded penalty area caught and went past Leno to put the home side ahead on the night.

With their next attack Atletico could have got the all-important second goal but a brilliant tackle from Wendell denied Mario Mandzukic. It was Arda’s pefect through ball that put the Croatian striker through but as he delayed his shot the Brazilian defender clean swept the ball away from him to safety.

It was brilliant defending but would any of Atletico Madrid’s previous strikers – Sergio Aguero, Radamel Falcao, Diego Costa – have buried it before the defender could react? Probably yes.

FINAL SCORE: Atletico 3-2 Leverkusen 

Battering ram Mandzukic perhaps has other qualities but he was battered himself just before half time and left the pitch limping at the break. 

Surprisingly when the two teams emerged for the second half he was still on the pitch and Simeone had taken off Cani and put on Raul Garcia.

The midfield so nearly turned the ball past Leno from Koke’s cross in Atletico Madrid’s best chance of the second half. Koke had been inspirational throughout as Atletico took the game to Bayer. 

And as the clock showed 20 minutes of normal time left the crowd responded by cranking up the Vicente Calderon noise levels.

It spurred the team on and Griezmann hurtled down the left and crossed for Turan who flicked the ball behind him where there was no runner to finish the move.

Griezmann then crossed again for Turan and this time he got his shot away only for Leno to save.

Raul Garcia went down in the area under a challenge from Toprak but the referee waved away appeals. Raul Garcia stayed down, Simone urged him to get up and turned to Atletico supporters once more to lift his team. 

Everyone in the Calderon got a lift with eight minutes left when Fernando Torres was roared on to the pitch to replace Mandzukic. Could El Nino win the game for them?

With the match still on a knife-edge Calhanoglu upended Jesus Gamez and became the third Leverkusen player to be booked. Atletico Madrid had also picked up three yellow cards and there was no let-up as the clock ticked down.

Wendal became the seventh player to be booked when he chopped down Torres as he charged down the right with a minute left. The free-kick came to nothing but Torres kept going and forced a corner but Koke’s near-post kick was cleared and the referee blew for full time.

Stefan Kiessling was booked at the start of extra time – the German team’s fifth on the night – and they then had to take off the injured Lars Bender replacing him with Kyriakos Papadopoulos.

Torres was still stretching the opposition and with Leverkusen on the back foot a stinging shot from Raul Garcia was pushed away for a corner by Leno but over the two legs the Germans had proved as good at defending them as Atletico Madrid at taking them.

With five minutes to go Torres so nearly won it with a diving header from Koke’s cross. There was direction on the effort but not enough power to beat Leno. It didn’t matter, he scored his penalty and his dream of reaching another Champions League final - this time with his home town club - lives on.
