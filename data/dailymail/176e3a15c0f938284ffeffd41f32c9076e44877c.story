Debbie Jevans is understood to have received a six-figure pay-off from the RFU after walking out as chief executive of England Rugby 2015 less than six months before the World Cup.

That the RFU are prepared to hand over around £150,000 suggests the Twickenham hierarchy were just as keen to part company with Jevans as she was to leave them.

Jevans is believed to have been paid around £250,000-a-year and her leaving cheque would consist of the remainder of her contract for 2015 plus part of her bonus agreement.

Despite the breakdown of her relationship with the RFU high command of Ian Ritchie and Bill Beaumont, the size of the pay-off shows tournament preparations were in good shape.

The last big split before the Jevans affair in which both sides kept this quiet followed Adrian Chiles’ sacking as ITV’s lead football presenter.

Chiles has still not spoken out about losing his prime sports host role to Mark Pougatch, despite having settled his pay-off terms with ITV.
