Spectators at the Paralympic Games were blocked from filling hundreds of empty seats today as a ticket fiasco broke out during the first day of competition.

Just weeks after empty venues mired the start of the Olympic Games, angry sports fans have accused organisers of failing to learn from their mistakes

More than 400 seats were left empty for the powerlifting event at the Excel Centre today - but fans with day tickets were banned from filling them because officials were told the venue was full.

Sell-out: Incredibly the match was declared 'sold-out' on the official ticket site

Team GB fans queued outside the venue hoping to see home favourite Anthony Peddle compete in the men's 48kg group.

But they were told the venue was full, despite huge chunks of the auditorium sitting empty.

One furious spectator said: 'It's a farce. You would have thought the organisers would have learned after the Olympic ticket fiasco.'

When questioned, officials insisted: 'We have been told it is full so we are not allowing people in.

Elsewhere there were hundreds of empty seats at the Basketball Arena for the wheelchair match between USA and Turkey.

Angry fans who had been told the game was a sell-out were forced to watch the half empty venue on giant screens in the Olympic park.

'Full': Fans queuing outside were banned from filling the seats, because they were told the venue was 'full'

Earlier on Thursday the swimming competition kicked off in a barely half-full Aquatics Centre.

When challenged about the empty seats, organisers Locog insisted blamed late arrivals.

Locog were forced to draft in volunteers and members of the armed forces after a similar ticket farce during the opening stages of the Olympic Games.

Huge swathes of seats were left empty by sponsors and members of the 'Olympic Family' who were given tickets and failed to use them.

A Locog spokesman was unavailable to comment on the empty seats at today's weightlifting event.

The ticket farce came just hours after millions tuned into a spectacular opening ceremony at the Olympic Stadium.

More than 11 million British viewers watched Channel 4's coverage of a performance that included cameos by Sir Ian McKellen, Steven Hawking and singer Beverley Knight.
