This stunning panorama unveils a tapestry of stellar births and deaths spread across 50,000 light years.

The dramatic scene was captured by the Hubble telescope and reveals more details about our mysterious nearby spiral galaxy Messier 83 (M83).

While astronomers are poring over its features, Nasa has also enlisted the help of the public to understand exactly what they are seeing.

This new Hubble image shows the scatterings of bright stars and thick dust that make up spiral galaxy Messier 83, otherwise known as the Southern Pinwheel Galaxy

The galaxy, also known as the Southern Pinwheel, lies 15 million light years away in the constellation Hydra.

Although it looks sprawling, Messier 83 is just under half of the size of the Milky Way.

This galaxy is dramatic and unusual; it has hosted a large number of supernova explosions, and is thought to have a double nucleus lurking at its core.

The stunning image is being used to support a citizen science project dubbed 'STAR DATE: M83' which is enlisting public help to estimate ages for approximately 3000 star clusters.  

This is a Digitised Sky Survey (DSS) image of the area around M83. Located some 15 million light-years away in the constellation of Hydra, it is one of the most visible galaxies of its type in our skies

Located some 15 million light-years away in the constellation of Hydra, it is one of the most visible galaxies of its type in our skies.

M83's centre is mysterious and unusual; the supermassive black hole at its heart is not alone.

This striking spiral displays a phenomenon known as a double nucleus - a feature that has also been spotted in the Andromeda Galaxy, the nearest spiral galaxy to us.

This does not mean that Messier 83 contains two central black holes, but that its single supermassive black hole may be ringed by a lopsided disc of stars.

As well as this double nucleus, Messier 83 has hosted six supernova explosions.

This number is matched by only two other galaxies: Messier 61 (potw1324a) which also has six, and NGC 6946 (opo9910e), which tops the list with nine.

Amateur scientists will use the presence or absence of the pink hydrogen emission, the sharpness of the individual stars, and the colour of the clusters to estimate ages.

For instance, the newest generations of stars are forming largely in clusters on the edges of the dark spiral dust lanes.

These brilliant young stellar groupings, only a few million years old, produce huge amounts of ultraviolet light that is absorbed by surrounding diffuse gas clouds, causing them to glow in pinkish hydrogen light.

Gradually, the fierce stellar winds from the youngest, most massive stars blow away the gas, revealing bright blue star clusters and giving a ‘Swiss Cheese’ appearance to the spiral arms.

These youngest star clusters are about 1 million to 10 million years old.

The populations of stars up to 100 million years or older appear yellow or orange by comparison because the young blue stars have already burned out.

Interstellar ‘bubbles’ produced by nearly 300 supernovas from massive stars have also been found in this Hubble image.  

By studying these supernova remnants, astronomers can better understand the nature of the stars that exploded and dispersed nuclear processed chemical elements back into the galaxy, contributing to the next generation of new stars.

This view of Messier 83 shows new Hubble data combined with ground-based data from the Giant Magellan Telescope, which shows a wider field of view so the whole galaxy is visible
