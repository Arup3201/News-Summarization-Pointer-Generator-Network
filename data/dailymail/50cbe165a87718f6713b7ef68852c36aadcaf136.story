Police have asked parents in South Florida to check their children's social media after three youths were accused of creating an Instagram account to post naked photos of other minors.

Two boys, aged 12 and 15, and a 13-year-old girl were arrested by Pembroke Pines police on Thursday after a 10-week investigation.

The trio faces charges of electronic transmission of child pornography. 

The social media account encouraged its 500 followers to post nude and sexually explicit photos of minors to 'expose' them, police said.

Arrested: Three youngsters, aged 12, 13 and 15, have been arrested on child porn charges for allegedly setting up an Instagram page that shared photos of naked minors and including their personal information

The posts included their names and personal information, and many followers posted cruel comments in response to the images. 

'The Pembroke Pines Police Department urges the community to pay close attention to their children's online activity,' Sgt. Angela Goodwin said in a news release Thursday. 

Sergeant Drew Jacobs told the South Florida Sun Sentinel that he didn't know what prompted the investigation, how long the account had been active, or how many young people were exploited.

'All I know is it's multiple,' he said.

Another spokesman, Sergeant Carlos Corretjer, said Friday the investigation is ongoing but no other arrests were imminent. He declined to discuss further details of the case.

Authorities said the charges could be felonies, depending on what the children are doing in the photographs. 

Parents who think their children may have been exploited can contact Pembroke Pines police or any other law enforcement agency.
