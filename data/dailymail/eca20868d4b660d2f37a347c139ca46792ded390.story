Jailed: Connor King, 18, went on a violent rampage after drunkenly staggering out of a family wedding

A teenager who grinned for his mugshot after staggering drunk out of a family wedding to carry out a 'terrifying' crime spree involving burglary and sexual assault has been jailed for five and a half years. 

Connor King, 18, went on a rampage after the reception, breaking into a flat in Folkestone, Kent, where two women and a baby were sleeping.

He woke the women and demanded alcohol but when they refused he threatened to kill them and they had to lock themselves in a bedroom.

King then went into a second bedroom and attacked a man while he was sleeping, punching him in the head up to 30 times before sexually assaulting him.

Canterbury Crown Court heard he then demanded money, picked up a screwdriver and threatened to stab him. When his victim refused he hurled a TV at him.

He then assaulted another neighbour who had heard the women's screams and stole a gold sovereign ring, a wallet, a mobile phone and USB cable.

King then went next door where he woke a couple and their young child as he climbed out a window to escape, telling them: 'I am going to a party'.

Police arrived to find the teenager standing on a window ledge 25ft from the ground before he climbed down and shouted: 'I'm a terrorist'.

King admitted six charges of assault, burglary and sexual assault and was sent to a Young Offenders' Institute for five-and-a-half years.

Judge Heather Norton told him: 'You embarked on a course of conduct that night which must have been terrifying for everybody involved.'

Not smiling anymore: King admitted six charges of assault, burglary and sexual assault at Canterbury Crown Court and was sent to a Young Offenders' Institute for five-and-a-half years

Phil Rowley, defending, said King was drunk and had no recollection of the night. He said King had been used to help carry out burglaries since he was five.

Detective Constable Neil Moore said: 'It was clear he was heavily intoxicated and decided, in what was a truly bizarre set of circumstances, to hunt out more alcohol.

'It must have been truly terrifying for those involved and the sentence imposed reflects the severity of the crime.'
