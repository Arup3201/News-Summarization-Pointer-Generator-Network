A Darwin woman was left so distraught by the theft of her handbag that she phoned the Northern Territory police on Saturday night for assistance.

After being questioned by the officers, the 44-year-old woman from Jingili revealed she was mainly concerned about her cannabis, which she confirmed she had been keeping in the bag.

The woman even nominated her own suspect to police, saying she believed it had been pinched by a guest at her home.

A 44-year-old woman from Jingili in Darwin, called police on Saturday night asking them to help find her stolen handbag which she claimed held two $50 bags of cannabis

'She reported that her bag contained all the usual items including some cash - none of which she was too concerned about,' watch commander Brendan Lindner said in a statement on Facebook on Sunday.

'What was of particular concern to her, however, was her cannabis that was inside.'

The woman was very upset about the loss, he said, telling police that her handbag contained two $50 bags of cannabis.

'She was even willing to attend the police station at a later time to make a formal statement about her stolen drugs,' watch commander Lindner said.

'The woman's handbag remains outstanding and she unfortunately has no more drugs at home.'

He said if residents knew of anyone with cannabis for supply, 'please call police ... and we'll be only too happy to speak to them'.

The NT Police often communicate directly with Territorians via social media.
