The mother of a seven-year-old girl recovering from cancer has been cleared after keeping her off school for seven days.

Kerry Capper, 25, said she let her daughter have the odd day off to ‘keep an eye on her’ when she was feeling ill – fearing the disease had returned.

In 2010, her daughter Libby Bennett had been diagnosed with a tumour in one of her kidneys, but recovered after several months of chemotherapy.

The cancer has not come back but Libby remains under the care of Birmingham Children’s Hospital for regular check-ups.

Between January and March this year Miss Capper kept Libby at home for a total of seven days when she felt unwell, instead of sending her to Paget Primary School, in Pype Hayes, Birmingham.

Ms Capper, from Birmingham, had been summoned to appear before magistrates today for failing to pay a £60 penalty fine for the ‘unauthorised absence’, which was later increased to £120.

The unemployed mother told Birmingham Magistrates' Court today that she 'couldn’t afford to pay', which landed her with the summons to court, and a trial.

Birmingham council said no reason was given for the time off and that Miss Capper had failed to attend meetings arranged by the school to discuss the situation.

Tom Harrill, prosecuting for the council,
 said Ms Capper provided no evidence of her daughter’s sickness or of 
some 'unavoidable cause' which prevented her daughter attending school.

The mother claims she had run out of credit on her mobile phone so was unable to inform the school that Libby – who had an 85 per cent attendance record prior to the fine – would be absent.

But the authority said it took a ‘robust stance’ on unexplained school absences.

Ms Capper told magistrates that her daughter had a kidney taken out in 2009 to remove a cancerous tumour 'the size of a grapefruit'.

The procedure left her daughter’s immune system weakened, and she informed teachers of that when Libby started at the school in July 2011.

In the run-up to the diagnosis with cancer, Ms Capper said her daughter had complained of 'stomach ache'.

She said that it was a similar complaint,
 together with a three-day bout of hand, foot and mouth, which accounted
 for her daughter’s absences earlier this year.

She accepted missing two meetings arranged by the school to discuss the days off. One one occasion she turned up on the wrong day and on the other she forgot to attend.

Asked why she had not made an appointment with the doctors when her daughter was ill, Ms Capper said: 'Unless you phoned the doctor really early, you couldn’t get an appointment the same day.'

The prosecution argued that she had no doctor’s note or medical evidence to back up the reasons her daughter had been kept off school.

But Neil Davis, defending, said his client had a letter from a paediatric consultant at Birmingham Children’s Hospital which stated that Ms Capper got 'extremely anxious' whenever Libby complained of any abdominal pain.

Birmingham council said no reason was given for the time off and that Miss Capper had failed to attend meetings at Paget Primary School in Birmingham (pictured) to discuss the situation

In her school report, which was read to the court, the little girl was described by teachers as an 'excellent role model” who was a 'pleasure to teach' and was achieving above her age.

But a box had been checked stating her attendance needed attention.

The Government’s change to the law on school absences, in September last year, was designed to stop families taking pupils on term-time holidays.

But some parents have been penalised for children missing class to attend important events or medical appointments.

In May, Gaynor Hodge, 39, and her husband Leigh, 41, were warned they could face a £1,000 fine if they took their ten-year-old daughter out of school for her grandfather’s funeral.

Hanbury’s Farm Primary School, Tamworth, told the couple the reason did not amount to ‘exceptional circumstances’.
