The weather and conditions could hardly have been more different, but Andy Murray continued on from his Davis Cup thrashing of Donald Young earlier this month.

Having beaten the world No 44 earlier this month indoors in Glasgow, he did so again outside in the steaming humidity of the Miami Open to reach the third round.

Murray emerged the 6-4, 6-2 winner after an hour and 22 minutes and was left awaiting either Colombia's Santiago Giraldo or Dutchman Robin Haase.

It was a comprehensive enough performance, although there was the odd lapse of concentration against a player whose own level tends to undulate sharply. Murray raced to a 4-0 lead but was cut back to 5-4 as he briefly struggled with his movement.

In these heavy and windy conditions he was too solid for the American left hander and ultimately cruised through after having to fend off break points in the fourth game of the second set. 

Murray said after the match that he was pleased with his performance and, in particular, the way he handled the windy conditions.

Murray, who now plays hard hitting Colombian baseliner Santiago Giraldo, said afterwards: ' I've played well against him the last couple of times. 

'Obviously today was a very different match to Davis Cup; completely different conditions, the tactics that you go into the match with completely change because of the weather and the wind. 

The heat was okay. The wind obviously cooled you down a little bit when you were at the end changes. Sometimes it can be ridiculously hot, and that makes managing the points and your emotions important. So I just tried to play smart, and it worked.' 

Murray was in high spirits throughout the match and it showed in his high-tempo style of play
