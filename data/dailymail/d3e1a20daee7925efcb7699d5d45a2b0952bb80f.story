Internet predator: Anthony Molina-Iglesias, 30, raped his victims in the forest after posing as a photographer on the Craigslist website

A Miami man who raped and assaulted aspiring models by luring them to the forest after posing as a photographer on the classified website Craigslist, was caught this week.

Anthony Molina-Iglesias, 30, who was arrested on Tuesday, took his victims to the outskirts of Miami near wooded areas under the pretense of wanting to take pictures for a modelling shoot.

In the most recent incident, on June 28, two women aged 20 and 23, travelled from Orlando to Miami to meet Molina-Iglesias after he promised them free modelling photographs.

According to a Miami-Dade Police report, Molina-Iglesias met the two suspects at 3pm on the day of the crime, says the Miami Herald. 

He got into their car and directed them to a series of empty lots with wooded areas on the outskirts of Miami, close to 129th Avenue NW and 13th Street.

Molina-Iglesias first took the 23-year-old deeper into the wooded area while the 20-year-old girl remained next to her car changing her clothes for what she thought was going to be a photo shoot.

When he was far enough away from the car, Molina-Iglesias choked the first woman until she fainted and fell, according to the police report. 

Then he tied her hands behind her back with plastic bands, ripped off her clothes and raped her. 

Molina-Iglesias returned to the car and guided the second victim to the wooded area where he also strangled her and tied her hands.

The suspect took the aspiring models to a remote wooded area outside Miami and strangled them before sexually assaulting them

The police report does not say whether Molina-Iglesias raped the second woman. 

He then fled the scene in the car of the first victim, leaving both women behind, naked with their hands tied.

This is the second time Molina-Iglesias has been accused of posing as a photographer to rape a woman. 

On February 13 a 20-year-old woman claimed he took her to the same isolated wooded area outside Miami and raped her at gunpoint.

The suspect attracted some of his victims posing as a photographer on Craigslist, the web page of classified ads, police said.

José Iglesias, Molina-Iglesias’ uncle, told CBS 4 he was shocked.

‘I know he was charged. But I don’t know whether he did it or not,’ he said regarding the case in February. ‘We are stunned by this. In case he really did it.’ 

Molina-Iglesias was charged with two counts of sexual assault, including one with the use of a weapon.
