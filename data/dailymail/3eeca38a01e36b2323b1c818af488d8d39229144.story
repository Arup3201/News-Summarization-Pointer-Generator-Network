Libya's Prime Minister has claimed his country's former head of intelligence holds the key to solving the murder of policewoman Yvonne Fletcher, who was shot dead outside London's Libyan embassy in 1984.

Leader Abdurrahim El-Keib, who yesterday visited the spot where Wpc Fletcher was shot dead, described Abdullah al-Senussi as the 'black box' who would know who carried out the killing.

Senussi was one of Muammar Gaddafi's most senior henchmen who fled Libya last year and was arrested in Mauritania in March. He is wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. He is also suspected of involvement in the Lockerbie bombing.

Mr El-Keib, Libya's interim prime minister, said Abdul Senussi - also Gaddafi’s brother-in-law - was central to solving the murder case.

He added: ‘He’s the black box. I guarantee he was almost directly or indirectly involved in most if not all of the crimes [of the former regime]. That doesn’t mean others weren’t involved. But he definitely knows who they were.'

A team of detectives from the Metropolitan Police are to fly to Libya to continue their investigations into the unsolved murder, it was announced this week.

During yesterday's visit, the Libyan prime minister paused and bowed in front of the memorial to Wpc Fletcher and laid a wreath of white roses and carnations at the spot.

But Mr El-Keib said yesterday his country would 'work very closely together' with the UK after talks with Prime Minister David Cameron.

Joining the Prime Minister at the memorial were two of his body guards who - with their sunglasses, designer stubble and smart suits - struck a seemingly dramatic stance,reaching out an arm to grasp the metal railings behind, for the camera.

WPC Fletcher, who was 25, was shot dead as she policed an anti-Gaddafi demonstration outside the Libyan People’s Bureau. She was cradled by colleague John Murray, who has been behind a long-running campaign to find justice for her.

What is known is that the bullets which killed her and injured ten protesters came from inside the embassy. No-one has ever been brought to justice for the killing.

Ms Fletcher's mother Queenie, father Tim and sister Sarah Parsons have been hoping to see justice for their daughter ever since.

WPC Fletcher’s death led to an 11-day siege of the building in St James’s Square and the severing of diplomatic links between Britain and Libya. Mr El-Keib worked with the opposition while in exile during Gaddafi’s dictatorship and said he knew some of those involved in the demonstration.

Mr El-Keib worked with the opposition while in exile during Muammar Gaddafi's dictatorship, and said he knew some of those involved in the demonstration.

Senussi is wanted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity in Libya while France wants to try him in connection with the 1989 bombing of an airline over Niger in which 170 people died.

He may also have some information about the Lockerbie bombing.

Officers from New Scotland Yard and Home Office Minister James Brokenshire met Mr El-Keib today to discuss the Fletcher case.

Commander Richard Walton, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism said he was determined to get justice for Ms Fletcher.

He added: 'We have never lost our resolve to solve this murder and achieve justice for Yvonne's family. We see today's announcement as significant.'

Detectives remain in regular contact with Wpc Fletcher's family and update them on developments.

Mr El-Keib said Libya wanted to be 'long-term friends and partners' with Britain, and paid tribute to the role which the UK played in the international military mission to protect civilians from Gaddafi's forces during last year's uprising.

Addressing Mr Cameron he said: 'You took a bold decision when it was very difficult for many to even consider supporting the Libyan people. You took that decision which inspired many of us.'

Mr Cameron said: 'I am very proud of the role that Britain played to help secure a successful outcome in Libya and the support we gave through the Nato mission.

'I am very much looking forward to hearing about the progress towards a full democracy in Libya and the elections which you hope to hold before Ramadan this year.'

Mr El-Keib was appointed interim prime minister of Libya in October last year. Elections for a national assembly for Libya are expected in June or July, though no date has yet been set.

Mr Cameron and Mr El-Keib were also thought to be discussing the reconstruction of the country following last year's revolution.

And just days after the death of the only person convicted of the Lockerbie bombing, Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, they may also discuss whether any further evidence relating to the atrocity has emerged in the wake of the downfall of the Gaddafi regime.

Mr El-Keib spent much of his life working abroad as an academic and businessman in the United States and UAE, and played no part in Gaddafi's administration.

Speaking today, he dismissed his predecessor's regime saying his nation 'was a country where Libyans felt like aliens' and where people lived 'as close as you can get to the poverty line'.

Saying that citizens 'lived in fear of the security apparatus', he spelt out his objectives for the country after elections are held on June 19 - for which 2.5 million people have registered to vote.

The premier said life had already changed in the short time since Gaddafi's downfall with freedom of the press, human rights and transparency as cornerstones of life.

'These are special values that caused the revolution to take place,' he said.

He also promised laws banning people from insulting Libya and glorifying Gaddafi would be erased after the election.

Speaking at a talk in London, titled Re-establishing The State, Mr El-Keib said: 'I guarantee such laws will disappear completely.'

The prime minister also spoke of the massive job of rebuilding the country and its infrastructure with health, education and the economy high on his list of priorities.

'Under the circumstances we have been making excellent progress and we have been making that progress continuously to democracy and the rule of law,' he said.

Mr El-Keib told the audience of 250 that the times of corrupt deals being organised had gone.Contracts for rebuilding the nation would no longer get signed off by "just the man upstairs and he then starts asking you to do him favours'.

Referring to the country's oil and gas capabilities and future business with international companies, Mr El-Keib said: "The door is well open in a transparent fashion.

'You are welcome, everyone, that can help us move forward and enhance our production in the future.'
