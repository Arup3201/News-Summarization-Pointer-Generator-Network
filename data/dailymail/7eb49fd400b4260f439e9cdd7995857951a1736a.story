They were issued to US soldiers by the military at the start of Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2003 showing, in rank, the names and job descriptions of Saddam Hussein's government henchmen.

But today, as the cards are seen on display in the Pentagon in Washington D.C., they are now not much more than collectors items.

The majority of the 52 henchmen featured - including one woman then-known as 'Mrs Anthrax - have been either killed or captured.

Several remain unaccounted for or at large.

Ofcourse at the top was the Ace of Spades himself, President Saddam Hussein, who was captured in 2003 and executed in Iraq in December 2006. 

Collectors item: The deck of 52 Most-Wanted Iraqi Playing Cards from Operation Iraqi Freedom are seen October 17, 2014 in a display case at the Pentagon in Washington, DC

Henchmen: The playing cards provided by the U.S. Defense Department each depicted a leading Iraqi that the United States wanted to pursue, kill or capture in 2003. Several remain unaccounted for today

A deck of the 'Iraqi Most Wanted' playing cards is shown in an Operation Iraqi Freedom display at The Soldiers & Sailors National Military Museum & Memorial in Pittsburgh

The cards were developed by a team of five DIA Army intelligence officers and NCO's to help troops on the ground identify their enemy.

It was an idea that dates as far back as the Civil War and World War II.

The cards were officially named the 'Personality Identification Playing Cards' and went on to become a highly prized item for collectors.

There were rumors at the time that only about 200 decks were printed.

Each deck has two Jokers, one showing Iraqi military ranks and the other Arab tribal titles.

Many card manufacturers have created their own versions of the deck, mimicking them in the best way possible. 

#1 Most-Wanted: Saddam Hussein (Ace of Spades)

The Iraqi dictator was hanged in Baghdad on December 30, 2006.

#2 Most-Wanted: Qusay Saddam Husayn (Ace of Clubs)

Saddam Hussein's second-born son was killed during a US raid on his home in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul on July 22, 2003.

#3 Most-Wanted: Uday Saddam Husayn (Ace of Hearts)

Eldest son of Saddam Hussein was killed during the same raid on his brothers house, the Ace of Clubs Qusay Saddam Husayn.

#4 Most-Wanted: Abid Hamid Mahmud al-Tikriti (Ace of Diamonds)

The Iraqi military officer was executed by hanging in Iraq on June 7, 2012.
