A benefits cheat who claimed £40,000 after telling officials she could barely walk has been ordered to repay the full amount after being spotted walking the Great Wall of China.

Dawn Pinchen has six months to return the money she was given fraudulently after council officials spotted her holiday photographs on Facebook - or she will be sent to jail.

The 40-year-old from Annitsford, Northumberland, collected thousands of pounds in income support and disability allowance over six years after telling officials she couldn't walk 'the length of a car'.

In April, Pinchen was ordered to pay back the money weekly after admitting failure to notify the DWP of a change of circumstance. 

But after only giving back £1,000, she reappeared in court yesterday where a judge gave her six months to repay the remainder or face going to jail.

She has sold her house in order to settle the debt, Newcastle Crown Court heard. 

In 1994 Pinchen was legitimately claiming benefits, but failed to notify local authorities when her circumstances changed, 

Between 2007 and 2013 she continued to claim and was fraudulently given £39,209 in handouts. 

Pinchen and her husband have sold their home in order to repay the debt 

The Department of Work and Pensions discovered her claims were false when she posted photographs of herself on the Great Wall of China on Facebook.

Her husband, who made a large sum of money after selling websites, and deposited the money into her bank account, accompanied her on the trip.

Yesterday she was told she would face an 18-month jail sentence if the full amount wasn't repaid in time.  

Her barrister, Tony Cornberg, said: 'Mr and Mrs Pinchen acted quite expeditiously with this.

'The sale of the house is in train, they are two weeks away from exchanging contracts.'

In April Pinchen denied prosecution's claims that she had walked along the 13,000 mile wall, dismissing their accusations as 'rubbish'.  

Alec Burns, prosecuting, told the court: 'On the social media website, Facebook, Mrs Pinchen posted photos of her and her husband on holiday in China.

'There was a photo of her stood on the Great Wall of China.'  

Addressing the accused, he added: 'You were pictured on the great wall of China, walking.'

Sentencing, Judge Penny Moreland QC told Pinchen: 'Benefits are for those who need them and for those entitled.

'People like you, dishonest people, give those with honest claims a bad name and it is wrong.'
