An overjoyed little boy is seen gushing about his first kiss in a heartwarming video he filmed for his parents.

When Griffin, whose age is not known, told his parents that he had kissed a girl on the playground, they had him share his news on camera, and the video was later posted on YouTube. 

'This is amazing,' he says after introducing himself. 'I got my first kiss today, and it is just so mind-blowing that I can just feel it.'

The elementary school student animatedly recounts the experience inside a moving car, presumably on his way home from school.

'It's mixed up in my head and my heart,' he continues. 'When she kisses me, it goes to my brain. It goes to my heart.'

Griffin puts his hand on his head as he tries to describe the stream of emotions he had felt during the sweet moment.

'It just goes in my brain so much; it just goes kablooey! It’s so good! I had a funny feeling. It was so great.'

The video was first shared by AFV kids on January 9 and has since received nearly 18,000 views. 

'He should marry that girl,' one person commented on the YouTube page. 

Another wrote: 'Never thought a kid THAT young would say any words like that... Wow.'

The following day, the adorable footage was posted on the Facebook page of the Australian radio program The Kyle and Jackie O Show, where it received more than a million views and nearly 23,000 likes.
