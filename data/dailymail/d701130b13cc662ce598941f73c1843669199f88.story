Few games are more ambitious than Grand Theft Auto. But the bold Watchdogs –
splicing hacking with traditional sandbox gameplay, is determined to redefine
the genre.

And for fans who can’t wait to get their hands on the game, a new DedSec pack
has been unveiled  for all versions – packed with content that Watchdogs fans are sure to lap up.

Set to be a hit: There's no denying that Watchdogs is one of the best-looking open-world games ever made

The pack – available on all formats, features a 23cm Aiden Pearce figurine (the
game’s main character), augmented reality cards, a map of Chicago, badges, a
soundtrack and an ‘Art of Watchdogs’ book.

Gameplay-wise, there are three
single-player missions, new outfits and perks.

Ubisoft have kept Watchdogs close to their chest – only showing ‘hands-off’
demos. But that is likely to change as the game moves closer to launch.

Plot follows vigilante Pearce who can hack into Chicago’s electronic devices
tied up to the central operating system.

This opens up various ways to complete objectives –
using cameras to distract people or hacking traffic lights to cause road
blocks, for example.

Combat is a mixture of traditional stealth, parkour
(free-running) and cover-based, third-person shooting.

Although a next-gen title, Ubisoft have confirmed that the PC will be the lead
platform for the game – showcasing Nvidia’s TXAA anti-aliasing.

This creates a
smoother, clearer image than any other anti-aliasing solution by combining
high-quality MSAA multisample anti-aliasing, post processes, and temporal
filters.

NOW WATCH THE LATEST TRAILER HERE:

Watchdogs is released on November 22 for current-gen consoles and Xbox One and November 29 on PlayStation 4.
