An Idaho woman who is suspected of beating a hunter's falcon to death with a beaded scarf after she saw it take down a duck is facing a misdemeanor charge that the pet's owner thinks is too lenient.  

Patti MacDonald, 60, of Hauser, was charged with beating or harassing an animal after authorities say she fractured the skull of an eight-year-old falcon named Hornet on January 7.

Hornet's owner, Scott Dinger, said MacDonald should be charged with killing a protected species.  

Patti MacDonald of Hauser, Idaho, was charged with beating or harassing an animal after she allegedly beat a hunter's pet falcon (example pictured) to death with a beaded scarf in an effort to save a duck 

Scott Dinger (seen with other falcon) thinks MacDonald's misdemeanor charge was not harsh enough

Dinger, who was hunting with Hornet at the time, was about 500 yards away when the bird of prey made a successful attack and landed with the duck.

He said he was approaching the spot when he saw MacDonald's red Jeep Wrangler pull up.

Hornet flew away but appeared injured and Dinger found him dead about an hour later, the Coeur d'Alene Press reported.

The duck also died. 

According to Dinger, Hornet had been with humans since the day he was hatched.

He said: 'They don't really know they are falcons.

'That was probably a part of his undoing because you could walk up to him and he wouldn't fly or try to get away.'

The duck (example pictured) also died. MacDonald is facing up to six months in jail and a $5,000 fine

Dinger said it was tough to accept what happened because his bird was so young and falcons can live for about 30 years when they're with humans.

He said: 'I had planned for Hornet to live longer than me.'

Craig Walker, a regional conservation officer for the Idaho Fish and Game Department, said he received an anonymous call from a woman saying she tried to save a duck from a falcon.

The phone system identified the caller as MacDonald.

Walker wrote in a report: 'The woman later stated that she had been very upset about the duck being injured, but felt bad about injuring someone's pet, because she 'beat the crap out of it really hard.'"

Kootenai County Prosecutor Barry McHugh said he reviewed Walker's report and determined the misdemeanor charge was appropriate. 

Beating or harassing an animal is punishable by up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $5,000 for a first-time offender. 

Peregrine falcons were on the threatened and endangered species list, but they were removed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service in 1999.

'There are between 2,000 and 3,000 breeding pairs of American peregrine falcons in Canada, Mexico, and the United States.' according to the FWS.

It's unclear if Hornet was a peregrine.
