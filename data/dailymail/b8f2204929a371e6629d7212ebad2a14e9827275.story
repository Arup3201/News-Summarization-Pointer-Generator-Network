Manchester United must be kicking themselves after Real Madrid defender Raphael Varane revealed that he chose not to join the club in 2011 due to their purchase of Phil Jones.

But United are not the first club to miss out on a big star due to a combination of bad luck and poor judgement.

Sir Alex Ferguson was responsible for bringing in Jones and not Varane but at least he wasn't the manager who passed up on Diego Maradona in favour of, er, Alejandro Sabella.

Read on for more details about that particular gaffe and other ones who got away in British football's biggest transfer misses.

1 Kenny Dalglish - West Ham, 1966

The man hailed as King Kenny by the Kop could have been handed the same epithet by the Bobby Moore Stand instead had things turned out differently. 

Legend has it that West Ham boss Ron Greenwood thought Dalglish was too lightweight and so turned down the chance to sign the 15-year-old striker, but Harry Redknapp suggests in his new book, A Man Walks On to a Pitch, that Dalglish was always destined for Celtic. 

Dalglish went on to become both Liverpool and Scotland's greatest player.

2 Diego Maradona - Sheffield United, 1978

United boss Harry Haslam spotted a 17-year-old Maradona on a scouting trip to Argentina and was so impressed that he struck a £200,000 deal there and then. But when Argentinos Juniors demanded more cash the Blades board refused to cough up, and bought Maradona's countryman Alejandro Sabella instead. 

Sabella spent two years at Bramall Lane and went on to coach Argentina to last summer's World Cup final. Maradona inspired his side to win the trophy in 1986 and is perhaps the greatest footballer ever to live. Whoops.

3 Eric Cantona - Sheffield Wednesday, 1991

'Ooh Aah' - not just the sound of Manchester United fans singing Cantona's praises but probably also the mumbled response of Trevor Francis when asked why he didn't sign King Eric when he had the chance.

Cantona was up for grabs after an epic tantrum at Nimes (when he threw a ball at a ref and called in turn each member of the French FA's disciplinary team an idiot) and went on trial at Wednesday after threatening to retire from the game.

After a week of training indoors due to bad weather, Francis was somehow still not convinced and asked the striker to stay on for a further week to play on grass. Cantona refused and was snapped up by Leeds. He joined Manchester United a year later and became the first true star of the Premier League era (and the player who consequently transformed English football for two decades).

4 Alan Shearer - Manchester United, 1992

The Premier League's all-time record goalscorer could have ensured near total dominance for the top-flight's most successful club had he moved to Old Trafford from Southampton in 1992. Instead, Shearer chose to join Blackburn Rovers because United 'took too long' to seal the deal, which had been lined up. 

Shearer helped Blackburn pip United to the title in 1995 and became a thorn in their side for years as a world-class striker.

5 Andriy Shevchenko - West Ham, 1995

This one is best told in Harry Redknapp's own words: 'I was at West Ham and Frank Lampard Snr and I were approached by these two villains who said they were doing some business in the Ukraine, and we were so scared of them we agreed to have a look at a couple of these kids.

'One of them we played against Barnet Reserves and he scored the winner. They said they wanted a million quid for him, and Frank said it was too much — well I’m blaming Frank — and we let him go. His name was Andriy Shevchenko!'

6 Zinedine Zidane - Blackburn, 1995

When offered the chance to sign Zinedine Zidane, what might you say? Probably not 'no thanks - we've got Tim Sherwood'. Unfortunately that is roughly what the late Jack Walker, then Rovers owner, said when he had the opportunity to bring the greatest player of his generation to Lancashire. 

Instead, Zidane left Bordeaux for Juventus a year later and went on to become a legend in Italy and then an original Galactico at Real Madrid.

7 Zlatan Ibrahimovic – Arsenal, 2000

Not many 16-year-olds would turn down the chance to have a trial at Arsenal but Ibrahimovic was never your average player.

'Arsene (Wenger) gave me the famous red and white jersey - the No 9 shirt with Ibrahimovic on it and I was so pleased I even posed for a picture wearing it,' he said. 'He never actually made me a serious offer, it was more, "I want to see how good you are, what kind of player you are. Have a trial".

'I couldn't believe it. I was like, "No way, Zlatan doesn't do auditions".

Fourteen years later, Ibrahimovic has won titles at Ajax, Juventus, Inter Milan, Barcelona, AC Milan and Paris Saint-Germain, and is Sweden's greatest ever player.

8 Ronaldinho - St Mirren, 2001

Yes, you read right. Just before moving to Paris Saint-Germain, Ronaldinho was lined up for a short spell at the Scottish outfit, with his advisers insisting that he could do with a stint in Europe to acclimatise to the style of football on the continent.

Unfortunately for the Buddies  red tape scuppered the move. Ronaldinho, perhaps employing selective memory, said a few years later of the St Mirren move: 'I had a lot of offers from Europe. I can't remember where they were all from.'

Ronaldinho was the most skilful forward in the world at Barcelona in the early part of the 21st century

9 Cristiano Ronaldo - Arsenal, 2003

Ibrahimovic wasn't the only player to have been seduced by an Arsenal shirt with their name and the No 9 on the back. Sadly for Wenger, the tactic failed with Cristiano Ronaldo too.

The £80m Real Madrid superstar did what Zlatan would never do and took up a week's trial with the Gunners, but Wenger was gazumped by Manchester United, who used Carlos Queiroz to appeal to the Portugal starlet. 

Oh well, Arsene - at least you didn't miss out on Lionel Messi...

10 Lionel Messi - Arsenal, 2003

Ah. Right. 

Yes, unfortunately Wenger did also miss out on Messi, meaning the two greatest players on the planet both slipped through the Arsenal boss's fingertips.

Wenger came within a whisker of signing Messi from Barcelona’s La Masia academy when he was just 16, along with Gerard Pique and Cesc Fabregas, promising the Barca trio first-team football. Messi was, remarkably, interested in moving to north London, but the deal was ruined because of issues over the Argentina forward’s work permit.

And the rest, as they say, is history.
