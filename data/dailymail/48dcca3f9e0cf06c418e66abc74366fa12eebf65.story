It can reach a top speed of 155mph, and drive for 190 miles on a single charge.

The Detroit Electric SP:01 is the world's fastest electric car, and is set to take on Paypal billionaire Elon Musk's Telsa Roadster is the lucrative electric sports car market.

Only 999 of the cars will be built, and the plans have been masterminded by a team of executives from Lotus, who set up the firm five years ago to revive the century old brand.

Boasting 155 mph (249 km/h) top speed and covering the 0-62mph (0-100 km/h) in 3.7 seconds, the SP:01 has a range of almost 190 miles between recharges which takes 4.3 hours according to the auto maker

Detroit Electric, a startup electric-car maker reviving a brand that dates back more than a century, unveiled its first

With a projected top speed of 155 
mph, the Detroit Electric SP:01 is 'the world's fastest pure-electric 
sports car' the company says, adding the two-seater has a range of 'just
 under 190 miles' between charges.

The $135,000, battery-powered sports car is to go into limited production in August.

Founded more than five years ago, Detroit Electric enters a still-nascent market that is struggling to find buyers.

One of its would-be rivals, Fisker Automotive, a hybrid-electric sports-car company that hasn't built a car since last summer, has hired a law firm to advise on a possible bankruptcy filing.

The car will be built in the Detroit area at a dedicated plant with an annual capacity of 2,500, the company said Wednesday at a reception at its new headquarters in Detroit's historic Fisher Building.

Detroit Electric plans to build only 999 SP:01's, which it says will be followed by 'a new family of all-electric production cars, including two other high-performance models that will enter production by the end of 2014.'

The SP:01 appears to borrow heavily from the British-built Lotus Elise - no surprise considering a number of Detroit Electric executives previously worked for various affiliates of Lotus Cars.

Versions of the Elise have been used by other low-volume carmakers, notably Tesla Motors, which based its $100,000-plus Roadster electric car on the Lotus chassis.

The SP:01 will also see the revival of the century-old Detroit electric brand

The SP:01 will also compete with the Telsa roadster, which previously held the record with a top speed of 125 mph (201 km/h).

Detroit Electric said the SP:01 was being introduced 'following a five-year development and road-test program.'

The Detroit Electric brand had been dormant since 1939.

Previously, it was used on a series of electric cars built in Detroit from 1907.

The brand was revived in 2007 as a joint venture between China's Youngman Automotive Group - which tried unsuccessfully to acquire bankrupt Swedish automaker Saab in 2012 - and a small California-based electric-car company called Zap.

The venture hired Lotus Engineering in 2007 to provide contract design and technical services. In late 2007, Albert Lam, the chief executive of Lotus Engineering, joined the venture as chairman and was named CEO of Detroit Electric in 2008.
