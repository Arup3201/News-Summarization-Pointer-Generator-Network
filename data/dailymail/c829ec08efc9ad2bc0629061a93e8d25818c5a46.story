A boa constrictor is on the loose in Portsmouth after a man threw it into a hedge

A boa constrictor snake is on the loose in a city centre after it was thrown into a hedge when a taxi driver refused to allow it in his cab.

It is understood a man had the snake wrapped around his neck as he got into the cab, but the driver said he wasn't allowed in with it.

The passenger then threw the snake into a hedge and now police and firefighters are hunting for the boa in Portsmouth, Hants.

The whereabouts of the snake has sparked fear in the city as it comes just days after two children were killed by a python in Canada.

Connor, six, and Noah Barthe, four, were sleeping over in the flat where their friend lived above a pet shop.

The 14ft python escaped from the shop and strangled the boys to death.

A Hampshire Constabulary spokesman said: 'Police went to an address in Portsmouth following a report of a missing boa constrictor.

'It is believed the snake may be in nearby hedgerow.

'The RSPCA and Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service also went to the scene.

'A thermal imaging camera was used to try to find the snake.'

Elizabeth Oakshott lives on the street in Milton, Portsmouth, where the snake was last seen on Thursday.

The 75-year-old said: 'My neighbour has three dogs and they kept going to the bush around the side of the garden, but when someone came out to check it, they found nothing.

'The police went all along the hedge with a stick and pulled some of the branches back.'

Steve McGovern, who works for The Landscape Group, which maintains grounds around nearby student halls, said a man is understood to have thrown the snake.

He said: 'We were told a man got picked up by a taxi and he had a snake wrapped around his neck.

Hunt: The snake was last seen on this street in Portsmouth on Thursday

'The taxi driver said "there's no way you're getting in here with that" so he threw it in the hedge so he could still get in the taxi.

'It then drove him to wherever he was going - I don't know what to make of it.'

Security staff at the student accommodation have seen the funny side of things and have already nicknamed the animal Bernard the Boa.

The large snake is a member of the family Boidae, typically found in North, Central and South America.

It usually feeds on a wide variety of small to medium sized mammals and birds and can reach lengths of around 14ft.
