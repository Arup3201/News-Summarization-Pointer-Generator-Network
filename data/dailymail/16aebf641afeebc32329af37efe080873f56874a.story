A high school gym teacher's alleged year-long sexual affair with a 16-year-old student was exposed when she flew into a jealous rage because he was taking another girl to prom.

Joy Morsi, a 39-year-old teacher at Grover Cleveland 
High School in Queens, New York, allegedly had sex with the wrestler in the school gym and basement, and sent him raunchy selfies and emails.

The Long Island mother, whose husband also teaches at the school, was arrested on Monday and charged with third-degree rape.

The illegal relationship began in June last year when Morsi offered to help the student lose weight, prosecutors said in court today.

On June 10, Morsi allegedly lured the unidentified student into a 'secluded closet' where she exposed herself to him, prosecutor Taylor Piscionere said according to  New York Daily News.

She also allegedly sent the student emails asking if he was a virgin, along with saucy text messages.

The court heard the pair had sex all over the school from June to July last year, and continued to meet for sex outside of school.

Prosecutors said the victim reported Morsi to authorities about two weeks ago after she became jealous that he was taking a girl to prom.

In court today, Morsi pleaded not guilty to numerous counts of third-degree rape, a criminal sexual act in the third degree and one count of endangering the welfare of a child.

As the student turned 17 during the nearly year-long dalliance, subsequent alleged encounters are considered legal.

Morsi, described by some students as 'a hard-working teacher' did not comment as she left court. If convicted, she faces four years behind bars.

City Department of Education officials told New York Daily News that Morsi was 'immediately removed' from the classroom when she was reported.

'We find these claims disturbing and reprehensible and she will remain reassigned — far from any student and the school — pending a criminal investigation,' deputy press secretary Marcus Liem said.

'We will work closely with the school to ensure they are given any needed support.'

Meanwhile students at the school said rumors had long circulated about the alleged affair.

'We had a feeling that something was going on,' ninth-grader Josie Gonzalez told New York Daily News. 'They would always be together around the school.'

Eyewitness News ABC7 reported that the Department of Education is now looking into Morsi's interactions with other students.

Queens District Attorney Richard Brown said the case was 'particularly disturbing' because the encounters occurred at school.

'Schools should be safe havens for children. Instead, this defendant is accused of sexually preying upon one of her students during rendezvous all over the school.'
