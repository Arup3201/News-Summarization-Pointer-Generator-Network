A international women's footballer has told how she was forced to strip naked in front of officials to prove she was not a man.

Genoveva Anonma, 27, had just led Equatorial Guinea to their first-ever African Women's Championship when sinister questions arose about her gender.

Instead of celebrating her triumph, she was faced with having to take a crude and 'humiliating' gender test for members of the Confederation of African Football (CAF).

She said: 'They asked me to take all my clothes off in front of officials from CAF and the Equatorial Guinea team.

'I was really upset, my morale was low and I was crying. It was totally humiliating, but over time I have got over it.'

Genoveva Anonma says she was once forced to strip naked to prove she was a woman by football officials

In an interview with BBC Sport, the 2012 African Footballer of the Year said she was forced to take the test in 2008 after scoring the winning goal in a 2-1 triumph over South Africa.

But she said it  isn't the only time the she has  face scepticism from her peers.

At the 2011 Women's World Cup, Anonma was embroiled in a scandal about her gender alongside her international team-mates, sisters Salimata and Bilguisa Simpore.

Nigeria, South Africa and Ghana accused the Guinea trio of being men due to their physical attributes.

'You only need to have physical contact with them on the pitch to know this [that they are men],' said Ghana defender Diana Amkomah at the time.

Once more, the 27-year-old slammed those allegations even offering to undergo medical gender testing in the expectation of silencing her doubters once and for all.

Anonma, who plays for German giants Turbine Potsdam, says she has never had the chance to prove she has always been a female.

'I was hoping they would call me to tell me they were taking me to hospital to do tests, but they never did,' she added.

'They did nothing to me. It was just down to me alone to defend myself, to state that I am not a man, I am a woman.'

Female South African athlete Caster Semenya was banned by the sport's governing body in 2009 over suggestions she was actually a man. She was eventually cleared after a series of gender tests

The most high-profile gender controversy in sport was that of female South African athlete Caster Semenya who faced worldwide scrutiny over suggestions she was a man.

After claiming the world 800m title in 2009, she was subjected to invasive and embarrassing gender tests because of her muscular build and rapid improvement in times.

She had also exhibited high levels of testosterone.

She was sidelined from competition while the IAAF examined results of her tests and was even prevented from competing by officials after turning to a meet in South Africa.

An official investigation eventually cleared her to return in July 2010.

The IAAF said Semenya's case was and would remain confidential.

But the sport's governing body did confirm that a panel of medical experts had determined she could compete as a woman.
