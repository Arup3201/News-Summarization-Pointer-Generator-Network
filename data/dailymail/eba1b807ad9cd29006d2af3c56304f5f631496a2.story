Kris Boyd has warned Celtic’s John Guidetti that, as a newcomer to the Glasgow goldfish bowl, he has no idea how hard it will be to win a high-pressure Old Firm semi final.

Speaking before Saturday’s League Cup draw teed up the first Rangers and Celtic clash in almost three years, the confident Swedish striker had claimed the Parkhead side’s last-four opponents were ‘going down’.

Describing the last-four draw as a shot in the arm for the Scottish game, however, Boyd cautioned his Celtic counterpart that an Old Firm cup tie is unlike anything he will ever have experienced in football before.

‘Good for John Guidetti,’ said the Ibrox striker after news of the city rivals’ first meeting since April 2012 filtered through, ‘but that’s someone speaking who has never played in an Old Firm game before and who doesn’t know what he’s in for.

‘I don’t think it makes sense for anyone to stand up and say they’re going to steamroller teams, or do this or that, or such-and-such is going down.

‘Until you’ve played in that Old Firm fixture you don’t know what it takes and anyone can win those games on the day.’

Boyd reckons that a Rangers old guard featuring himself Kenny Miller, Lee McCulloch and Lee Wallace could give his side the edge in the semi-final.

Perhaps there was a failure on his part to acknowledge the fact that Celtic also have a group of Old Firm veterans featuring the likes of skipper Scott Brown, Kris Commons, Adam Matthews, Emilio Izaguirre and Beram Kayal.

But Boyd, clearly of the belief that the Ibrox side have performers who have been more steeped in the fixture over time, insisted: ‘We’ve got five or six players who have played in Old Firm games before. I’m not so sure about Celtic. It can be an advantage because you know exactly what you’re going into.

‘Celtic will be confident but if anyone was jumping around their dressing room at news of the draw then I’d bet it was none of those who have played in it - it will be those who don’t really know what it takes. We’ll see what happens when it comes around.’

A level of campaign weariness is likely before the tie finally comes around in three months’ time - with the Hampden showdown taking place on either January 31 or February 1 - but Boyd believes the resumption of old hostilities after so long on the backburner is good news for a Scottish game which has been divided and scarred following the Ibrox club’s financial demise in 2012.

‘It’s great,’ said the 31-year-old striker. ‘The whole of Scottish football needs this fixture. It’s a great opportunity for the two biggest clubs in the country to go head to head again.

‘We know that we’re still a division below Celtic, but we look forward to the game. It’s something for people to look forward to.

‘There’s not been a lot to talk about in Scottish football in the last couple of years in terms of Rangers and Celtic.

‘There has been a lot of negativity because they haven’t been playing each other - and it gives us an opportunity to build up what should hopefully be a tremendous game.

‘It’s a chance for us to show that Scottish football isn’t dead.

‘We’re still massive clubs worldwide and we want to go and put on a performance - but we know that we need to be at our best if we’re to have any chance of beating them.

‘People will write us off but we’re confident going into any game with the players we’ve got here.

‘I think everyone in the dressing room will be looking forward to the Celtic game. For us, it’s a difficult game and Celtic will go in as favourites.

‘But we know that if we play at our best then we can give anyone in Scotland a game. But, for us, the main focus is showing our league form of the last couple of months.’

Reacting to a school of thought that the pressure is all on Ronny Deila’s men - given their continued prominence in the Scottish game - Boyd was dismissive of any such suggestion and insisted that no Rangers player ever goes into a game without the weight of expectation on his shoulder.

Speaking after scoring his eighth goal of the season in a 1-0 Scottish Cup win at Dumbarton on Saturday, the frontman added: ‘As soon as you pull on that blue jersey you never accept defeat so the pressure is also on us despite being underdogs.

‘The responsibility of being a Rangers player is that you need to win. It will be a massive game but I can’t emphasise enough how much our focus needs to be getting back into the top flight.

‘We want four, five, six Old Firm games a season and that will only happen once Rangers get back to the top and if you draw each other in the Cups.

‘The most important thing right now is to focus on the league and to get back to the Premiership.

‘We’ve got a massive game coming up against Hearts at the end of the month and before that we’ve got Cowdenbeath on Tuesday night and Alloa and Falkirk at home where we’ll be looking to keep the pressure on Hearts.’
