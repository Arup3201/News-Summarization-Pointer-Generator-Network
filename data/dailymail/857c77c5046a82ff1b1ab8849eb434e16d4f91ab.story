An 11-year-old accusing of beating a tiny baby so badly she died allegedly invited her for a sleepover on the night she died.

The unnamed suspect, who has been charged with the murder of two-month-old Zuri Whitehead, is said to have asked her mother to secure the fatal visit last Thursday in Wickliffe, Ohio.

Whitehead's mother, Trina, said the suspect's parent called her around 9:30pm that evening and asked whether she wanted them to take the child off her hands for the night.

The next morning, Zuri's bloodied body was rushed to hospital, where tests confirmed that she died of repeated, brutal blows to the head.

She suffered massive brain injuries, severe damage to the liver, spleen and kidneys, and extensive internal bleeding, police said.

The eleven-year-old, who is being held in a juvenile detention center, was on a couch with her 39-year-old mother and Zuri until 3am, when her mother fell asleep.

By 3:30am she had awoken to the sight of her child holding the battered infant. Police say the suspect had gone upstairs with Zuri - and by the time she came back the damage had been done.

Zuri was still alive then - though she struggled to open her eyes and had trouble breathing. She died during surgery at Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland.

Trina Whitehead also said that the 11-year-old's mother was her best friend, and that she had no reason to suspect anything untoward would happen.

It had earlier been reported that the sleepover was offered to Whitehead, who has three other children, to give her a break for the evening.

The two mothers had known each other for some five years.

The suspect appeared at the Lake County Juvenile Court Monday, where she was pictured by local TV station WOIO silently burying her head in her hands.

She has had a not guilty plea entered on her behalf for the murder charge.

Wickliffe's police chief, Randy Ice, said the girl has yet to show any signs of remorse.

He told a new conference: 'I'm not sure she appreciated the gravity of what she did.'
