Wasps director of rugby Dai Young described Saracens as a unique team to play against after his side lost a crucial Premiership match at the Ricoh Arena.

Brilliant tries from Christian Wade and Elliot Daly, with two conversions and a penalty from Andy Goode, had seen Wasps build up a 17-3 lead after the first 20 minutes.

But after that the Saracens pack became the dominant force with Richard Wigglesworth and Alex Goode controlling matters at half-back. Their tries came from Chris Wyles and Mako Vunipola with Alex Goode converting both and adding four penalties.

'We knew what was coming from (them) as they don't play a lot of rugby, (they) kick the ball a lot to squeeze you and it's very hard to play against.

'If you can control it, you get options to play as we showed in the first 20 minutes but after that we struggled to deal with the aerial bombardment as we dropped the ball far too often.'

Despite the loss, which was a huge blow to Wasps' chances of making the play-offs, Young was adamant that his team were moving forward.

'Nothing changes as a result of today, we are still a work in progress and we are still aiming for a place in the top six.

'We will address what went wrong today for our set-piece didn't function as well as we would have liked and we lacked a bit of control in the second half.

'However, we do have individual players who can lighten up any stadium as you saw in the first 20 minutes.'

Saracens boss Mark McCall was complimentary to his side as they had stuck to their game plan after going 17-3 down.

He said: 'We had the clarity of thought not to be spooked when they scored two tries in three minutes as we put the ball in the right areas to put pressure on them.

'You can see that they have people who can hurt you from long range as they've scored a lot of tries from inside their own half this season.

'We had chances to close it up late on, which we didn't take, but we did deprive them of a vital bonus point.'

The only downside for the Saracens was the loss of Brad Barritt, who limped off in the second half following a heavy collision with Andy Goode.

'We are hopeful it isn't too serious and we have our fingers crossed because Brad must be very close to England selection next week,' added McCall.
