Beanie Babies creator Ty Warner has pleaded guilty to federal tax evasion after failing to report income earned in a secret offshore bank account.

The businessman behind the stuffed toy animal craze in the 1990s has already agreed to pay a penalty of more than $53 million.

He apologized in a choked-up voice for hiding millions of dollars in a Swiss bank account.

Charges: Ty Warner, the man behind the Beanie Baby craze, allegedly failed to report income in an offshore bank account

Mr Warner, who lives in suburban Chicago and is the sole owner of TY Inc., still faces the prospect of time behind bars. A conviction on a federal tax evasion charge carries a maximum five-year  sentence.

'When I signed those returns, I knew those moneys were missing,' Warner said. 'It was not accurate. I apologize for my conduct. It's a terrible way to meet you,' Warner told the judge.

Struggling to keep his composure, Warner rubbed the back of his neck as he spoke and also said he had much to be thankful for.

In court, Warner acknowledged that he told no one of his foreign bank accounts, not even his accountants.

Warner even concealed his name from one account by registering it as 'Molani Foundation,' a 'sham company,' prosecutors said in court.

Prosecutors say he failed to report $24.4 million in income from 1999 to 2007 and failed to pay taxes of about $5.6 million.

He faces up to five years in prison for one count of tax evasion. Sentencing guidelines call for prison time of 46 to 57 months, according to Warner's 18-page plea agreement.

Taxpayers must report financial accounts in foreign countries if their value exceeds $10,000. Such penalties can equal up to 50 percent of the amount in the account. The account had as much as $107 million at one time, it was disclosed

The 69-year-old, said by Forbes to have a $2.6 billion net worth, was behind the Beanie Babies craze that made the company hundreds of millions of dollars in the mid-90s.

He ranks 209th in a recent Forbes list of the richest Americans.

The small, plush toys come in various animal forms with heart-shaped name tags and were considered valuable collectors' items.

His most valuable investment however, is said to be New York's Four Seasons Hotel. He turned down a $900 million offer to buy it in November last year.

Mr Warner maintained a secret offshore account starting in 1996 with the Switzerland-based financial services company, UBS.

His attorney, Gregory Scandaglia, said Mr Warner accepts full responsibility.

'This is an unfortunate situation that Mr Warner has been trying to resolve for several years now,' Mr Scandaglia said.

According to prosecutors, Mr Warner earned $3.1 million in gross income in 2002 through investments held in the UBS account.

Soft touch: Ty Warner hiding $25 million in income in secret Swiss bank accounts. The toy-maker's 18-page plea deal says guidelines call for a prison term of around four years. He is also going to have to pay a $53 million fine

Income: Ty Warner has agreed to pay a penalty and will plead guilty, his attorney says

He committed tax evasion by failing to inform his accountants about that income.

By leaving out his UBS income, he falsely reported that his total income in 2002 was $49 million, prosecutors said.

'Regardless of wealth, everyone must pay taxes on all of their income, not just the amount they choose to report,' Gary S. Shapiro, the acting U.S. attorney in Chicago.

He will be sentenced on January 15th, 2014.
