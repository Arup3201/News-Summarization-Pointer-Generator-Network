A blazing hot weekend was tonight set to end as more than an inch of rain was forecast to fall in less than two hours before the morning.

The Met Office has issued a yellow ‘be aware’ rain weather warning for tomorrow in Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Essex, Hertfordshire and Suffolk.

Areas of the South East could see up to 1.2in (30mm) of rain and even thunderstorms, with residents told to be aware of localised surface water.

It follows a week of hot weather as thousands of people descended on beaches around the country after temperatures reached 30C in the South East.

And as families packed up their picnic blankets, buckets and spades, the south coast became the place to be for people looking to party.

Danger: A boy jumps from a footbridge into the River Taff in Pontcanna, Cardiff, into shallow water, which only comes up to the waist of other youngsters in the river

Party: A hen do group sit on Brighton beach dressed appropriately for the seaside as sailors, whilst drinking alcohol as the sun goes down on the south coast

Youngsters and hen dos gathered near fires to keep warm while the sun set on Brighton beach in East Sussex last night.

Revellers partied until 6am and slept in tents or in sleeping bags on the pebble beach.

Cleaners dodged groups of people this morning as they prepared to clear up for another day of people seeking sunshine.

But
 those heading to the beach were faced with a slightly cooler day than 
yesterday - with a high of around 23C forecast for Brighton today.

Most
 of the UK has dropped in temperatures today. 
Helen Waite of the Met Office said: ‘It is cooler everywhere today than 
yesterday.

‘In the North 
West there will be cloudy conditions and temperatures of around 20C in 
Manchester, whereas yesterday it was about 27C.

‘There
 is rain and showers between Scotland and Northern Ireland and a few 
showers over northern England. This will continue through much of the
 day.

‘Glasgow will stay 
partly cloudy and windy through most the day with a maximum temperature 
in the high teens, possibly a bit less.

Fire: After a busy day full of people seeking the sun, Brighton beach was not given a break as revellers embarked on the coast for some evening fun

Overnight: Visitors to the beach made the most of the hot weather, when it soared to almost 30C in Brighton yesterday and remained a warm night for most

‘South
 it is drier with some sunny spells. The sunshine might be a bit hazy 
and the maximum temperature will be around 26C or 27C in the South 
East.’

She added that things are set to turn worse tonight but things will clear up by tomorrow.

‘The rain in the north at the moment will move south down the western side and into Wales.

‘North it will be drier overnight with some cool spells and some misty patches this evening.

‘We’ve
 got a yellow warning for heavy rain in the South East and we can expect
 some heavy downpours particularly in the Kent and Sussex area.

‘There might be some downpours through the evening to start with showers transferring down from the north.’

She
 added: ‘There could be some thundery showers in the South East from the
 early hours of tomorrow morning and that risk continues throughout 
Monday, with eastern areas more at risk of seeing a thunderstorm.

‘However
 there will be some sunny spells around and drier weather and 
temperatures are more likely to be around 23C or 24C in the South East.

‘It
 will be about 25C in London and will still feel fairly warm when the 
sun is shining. Tuesday will be dry with a few isolated showers.

‘A
 band of rain will move into the North West and western parts of 
Scotland, while it will be cloudy in Northern Ireland. There is likely 
to be a bit more of a north-westerly breeze.’

During
 the recent hot weather, a group of schoolchildren were filmed jumping 
12ft off a bridge into shallow water in an attempt to cool down.

Daring
 youngsters catapulted themselves into the River Taff, at Pontcanna in 
Cardiff, which is full off obscured rocks and has been notorious for 
tombstoning over the past 30 years.

Despite
 claiming the water was more than 6ft deep, photos reveal children stood
 in waist deep just inches from where their friends were landing.

Horrified by-standers said the stunts ‘defied belief’ and called on authorities to put an end to the craze.

Graham
 Thomas, 56, said: ‘There are parents bringing their children here to 
get involved, it defies belief, it's a weir, not a deep river.

‘It seemed like there was a tiny bit that was just a little bit deeper than the rest.

‘But
 it can be no more than about 6ft, the rest had to be about 3ft or 4ft 
maximum, so if you missed the area there would have been serious 
consequences.’

Mr Thomas added: ‘They were doing back flips and all sorts off this bridge, my heart was in my mouth every time it happened.

‘Someone needs to do something about it, it was terrifying.’

Meanwhile
 a man has died after going into the sea in North Tyneside. Police were 
called to the Fish Quay in North Shields at around 5.33pm yesterday.

The
 man in his 40s is believed to have got into difficulty after jumping 
into the water and members of the public jumped into rescue him.

He was taken to hospital for treatment where he was pronounced dead.

The
 incident comes just three days after Andrew McWilliams died after 
wading into a lake in Watergate Park in Sunniside, Gateshead.

Chief
 Superintendent Kay Blyth, of Northumbria Police, said: ‘We're in the 
process of notifying friends and family and our thoughts are with them 
at this incredibly sad time.

‘There's
 not believed to be any third party involvement and a report will be 
prepared for the coroner, and a future inquest will establish exactly 
what happened in this incident.’

She added: ‘I'd like to reiterate previous advice about staying safe around water.

‘We
 know during hot weather more people spend time at the beach, at rivers 
and lakes and it's important they are aware of the dangers.

‘Open
 water can be extremely deceiving with powerful currents and tides and 
possible obstructions under the surface which pose a risk, even to 
strong swimmers.

‘Some of 
the region's beaches are staffed by Royal National Lifeboat Institute 
Lifeguards with safe bathing areas clearly marked with flags on the 
beach, we'd encourage people who want to go into the sea to visit these 
areas.’

Monday will see some sunny spells and temperatures are more likely to be around 23C or 24C in the South East.
Tuesday will be dry with a few isolated showers

Two school boys have already drowned this year after getting into difficulties in rivers.

Rony
 John, 15, went missing in the River Great Ouse in Cambridgeshire, while
 Conor McColl, disappeared at an old quarry in Bedfordshire.

Despite today’s weather warning, parts of the South East are set to be as warm as the South of France by next week.

Although the heatwave is not set to return, temperatures will remain above average, according to forecasters.

London could top 27C while other areas of the south and the Midlands will see the mercury in the mid-20s.

But
 there will be a split across the country with north-west Scotland and 
Northern Ireland languishing under a low pressure front from Tuesday.

For the rest of the week the south coast should see plenty of sunny spells with a few isolated showers.
