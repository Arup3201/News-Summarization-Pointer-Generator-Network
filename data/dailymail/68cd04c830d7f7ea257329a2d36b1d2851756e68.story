All being well, Alan Pardew will return to the scene of his greatest playing triumph on Thursday. This time, he is the manager.

At Villa Park in 1990, wearing the red and blue striped shirt of Crystal Palace, he scored the dramatic extra-time winner in the FA Cup semi-final against Liverpool.

Credit to Pardew because he intends to take the team against Aston Villa provided the announcement confirming that he is the new Palace manager is made today. That is certainly the intention. 

Alan Pardew is hoping to take charge of Crystal Palace for their New Year's Day match against Aston Villa

Pardew made 128 league appearances between 1987 and 1991, scoring eight goals.

The highlight of his time at Selhurst Park, however, was the FA Cup run in the 1989-90 season.

Pardew was one of the 'Fab Four' (with Mark Bright, Gary O'Reilly and Andy Gray) and scored the winner against Liverpool in that memorable 4-3 semi-final victory at Villa Park (the other three also netted in that match).

The Eagles pushed Manchester United all the way in the Wembley final, drawing 3-3 in the first match, but lost 1-0 in the replay.

Pardew played every minute of both matches.

It would be easy to swerve this one, to sit in the stand alongside co-chairman Steve Parish and club ambassador Mark Bright.

Instead he intends to be there for the game, most likely in the dug-out for the first of 19 matches that will decide whether Palace stay in the Barclays Premier League.

Good on Pardew for that. He takes over a team who need organisation, focus and discipline after Neil Warnock was sacked following the 3-1 defeat at home by Southampton on Boxing Day.

On Tuesday, Warnock gave his first interview since leaving Selhurst Park and he couldn’t resist throwing a few grenades at Parish.

‘I would have liked the chairman to tell me they had a chance of getting Alan Pardew and would I mind stepping down,’ he told talkSPORT.

‘When I was clearing my desk, Ronnie Jepson said “Gaffer, they’ve got someone else”.’ 

Pardew will acquire a leader in the form of Mile Jedinak, but the club captain will be away for a month at the Asia Cup with Australia

His assistant called that right. Pardew was always Plan A, the man Parish wanted when Tony Pulis walked away two days before the opening game of the season. At the time, the former Palace man wasn’t ready.

On this occasion he is and his brief, beyond survival, is to build a team who can compete in the top half of the Premier League.

In an interview given by Parish last week, the ambitious Palace co-chairman admitted that he craved a run in one of the cup competitions.

Palace will turn their attention to the FA Cup on Sunday when they go to Dover in the third round, but the priority remains the Premier League.

All was quiet at Crystal Palace's Beckenham training on Tuesday, with no Pardew announcement imminent

The circumstances will be very different at Palace, where the stadium has changed little since Pardew (below) left for Charlton in November 1991. Back then the team trained at the Imperial Sports Ground in Mitcham, and they have conducted a tour of south London in the intervening years before ending up in Beckenham.

On Tuesday Warnock complained about the infrastructure at the club and claimed the training ground was not the right standard for a Premier League team. It has been interpreted at Selhurst Park as a bit of bitching, particularly after he claimed he took over a club in chaos. Last season Palace finished 11th, which Warnock insists was ‘lucky’. 

In the dressing room, Pardew will acquire a leader in the form of Mile Jedinak, but the club captain will be away for a month at the Asia Cup with Australia.

Steve Parish made a bold move by sacking Warnock after four months, and has appointed Pardew instead

Pardew will also have his work cut out rebuilding the shattered confidence of Palace’s forward line after Warnock’s criticism of them in recent weeks. Fraizer Campbell has not recovered from his miss against Manchester United in November and Dwight Gayle, the best finisher at the club, is in need of direction.

There will be money to spend in the transfer window and the club have already spoken to Pardew about potential targets. 

At Selhurst Park he will have a greater say in recruitment, a refreshing change from the limitations of working for Newcastle owner Mike Ashley.

By hiring Pardew, Parish has overlooked his man’s disappointing spell as manager of Charlton in 2006. He could not halt the slide and they fell out of the Premier League after winning only five games with him in charge.

At Palace, he will need to win a few more than that.
