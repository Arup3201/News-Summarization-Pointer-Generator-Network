For a man who did so much good work in cricket, Richard Bevan should have known when to play with a straight bat. For a man who held an international rally driving licence for six years, he should have known when to swerve.

But Bevan has crashed this time. The ball has gone through the grille.

From the 11 years he spent at the Professional Cricketers’ Association to his six at the helm of the League Managers Association, not many in either sport speak of his mistakes because there aren’t many. He is respected, he trumpets the causes most would agree with and, generally, has succeeded in modernising two organisations that needed it.

Resignation: Cardiff said that Richard Bevan's position is now untenable and the LMA boss should resign

Texts: The LMA described Malky Mackay's messages to Iain Moody as ‘friendly text message banter’

His default position has been to support his members, which in the majority of cases in a trigger-happy sport has been the right course of action. But his organisation has taken a big risk in the case of Malky Mackay.

Far from helping Mackay’s situation, the statement from Bevan’s organisation made it worse, if possible.

The extent of Bevan’s involvement in the statement is not known. But the end product is way out of kilter with his background.

He is a well-educated man, an astute politician of sport. He went to the prestigious Shrewsbury School, whose alumni include Lord Hutton and Michael Heseltine.

His profiles variously point to him competing in three RAC Rallies, as well as windsurfing, playing football and cricket to a high amateur standard and golfing to a handicap of six. But in sports administration he has made his name. People in cricket talk of a tough, streetwise negotiator who shaped up the PCA.

He was the statesmanlike figure guiding the England team in their decision to boycott a tour of Zimbabwe in 2003.

His work to help former cricketers who fell on hard times should also be noted.

He has made errors since taking over the LMA in 2008, but he has also spoken a lot of sense, questioning the consequences of transfer windows and calling for the FA to hold more power over the Premier League.

His work has been motivated by a desire to protect managers, who obviously need it at a time when only 16 of the 92 clubs have retained their boss since the 2011 calendar year.

‘Telling people, “It’s fine, get a mortgage” and the following week sacking them is something that they cannot do,’ Bevan said earlier this year.

Sadly, what his organisation said about Mackay’s situation made far less sense.
