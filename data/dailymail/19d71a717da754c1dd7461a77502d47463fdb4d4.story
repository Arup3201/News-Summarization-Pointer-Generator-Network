The boss of  Blue Sky Hostel in Glasgow, Todd Pedersen, who has sparked an online storm

A hostel owner has stumbled into controversy after being branding a customer as a ‘retard’ in an online spat.

Todd Petersen fired the unpleasant insult at a guest who left a negative review of his property.

Louise Taylor stayed at Blue Sky Hostel in Glasgow during a visit to see the ongoing Commonwealth Games.

But after deciding that her accommodation was less than satisfactory, she vented her frustrations on the hostel’s Facebook page.

‘Worst hostel I have ever stayed in,’ she wrote.

‘Grotty,
 uncomfortable, wires coming out of walls everywhere, mouldy bathrooms, 
only 1 working shower in the building, aggressive, foul mouthed staff 
& at 2am there were people having to change beds & rooms about 
which woke everyone else up.

‘No
 light switch in the room nevermind a plug socket! Bed was a foam 
mattress which didn't even cover the springs. Place is a health hazard. 
AVOID.’

Her words earned the ire of Mr Pedersen.

Now,
 as the row has gone viral, the Canadian hotelier, 46, has defended his 
abusive comment – and claimed that Louise, from Lancashire, did not 
raise any concerns during her stay.

‘It was totally ridiculous,’ he said. ‘She didn't ask anything or make a peep while she was here and was asked when she left, and said everything was OK.

‘Four hours later I saw the review on the webpage and it was just ridiculous. Saying things that were totally wrong.

‘She
 didn't say anything like that. We did have a screw up with people in 
her room. She didn't know where stuff like the showers were and she 
didn't ask.

‘After
 the fourth or fifth person I just started taking the piss out of them. 
Just a big joke after that. People were calling me Hitler and all kinds 
of things, and it just got blown up.

‘I don't remember half the stuff that went on there. What can you do? Everybody just started saying all kinds of crazy stuff. All of a sudden it's gone viral.

‘The part I stand by is when I said look you didn't ask anybody anything, all your assumptions were wrong.

‘Nobody has any face-to-face communications any more. They can type on Facebook and can't come down to reception and say they're unhappy.

Angry exchange: The row has been sparked by a stay at the Blue Sky Hostel which left a guest unsatisfied

‘All your complaints could have been rectified in two seconds if you'd asked. The rest of it was just a bunch of people blowing things out of proportion.’

In his initial online response, Pedersen claimed: ‘We are having a new fire alarm installed, sorry, we care about safety.

‘The
 light switches are right beside the door, open your eyes. There are six
 sockets in the room you were in, they are in the wall where they 
normally are in most houses.

‘The
 reason people were being moved is because you retards left your door 
open and people came in your room that were not booked in your room.

‘This is why everyone must have a key and not put shoes in the doors when you go to the toilet!

‘Not once did you come ask where showers were, if you did you would have been told the locations.

‘There are showers on every floor.

'Obviously you have no communication skills other than typing in Facebook.’

Other
 people were quick to join the debate between the pair after Todd 
claimed the hostel was for those aged 18-35 and said he warned people 
who wanted ‘five-star’ service that this isn't what they will find at 
his establishment.

One Facebook user, Grant Hodgson, wrote: ‘You're lucky you aren't 36, Lou. Otherwise you would've been too old to stay.’

Pedersen
 replied saying: ‘That's why we have a age limit, seems after 35 people 
bitch about everything, ohhh, i booked a 18 bed dorm and couldn’t 
sleep...’

A
 determined Louise told the owner: ‘I didn't want 5 star service; I 
wanted a clean bed for the night, the ability to sleep and the ability 
to have a shower in the morning without scalding myself/feeling sick 
looking at all the mould.’

After
 the exchange went viral, users of the social networking site moved to 
TripAdvisor to post fictitious reviews of the hostel.

Someone
 even mocked up a picture of the hostel owner on a book cover titled: 
‘F**k You: Lessons in customer service and general satisfaction.’

The
 hostel owner remained upbeat about the online conversation which has gone viral online.

He said: ‘There's no such thing as bad publicity. Who knows what's going to happen? It doesn't really matter.

‘I've got thriving business and about 2,500 customers in a month and have about four complaints.

'If she would have just come and asked, everything would have been sorted out, but she didn't.’
