Yale University has found six students guilty of 'non-consensual sex' in the past six months and not one of them has been expelled from the prestigious Ivy League college, according to an official report.

Four of the perpetrators were given written reprimands after the victims reported the sexual assaults to staff, one student received probation and another was suspended for two semesters but will be free to return next year to graduate - with an Ivy League diploma.

Yale, which is based in New Haven, Connecticut, said it responded to a total of eight reports of sexual assault in the first half of 2013. The other two students were found not guilty of rape allegations, the school said.

Yale spokeswoman Karen N. Peart 
insisted the university does not tolerate sexual misconduct but she 
refused to discuss specific cases.

In
the fourth semi-annual Report of Complaints of Sexual Misconduct, 
released on Wednesday night, Peart admits the descriptions of cases in 
the report 'do not fully capture the diversity and complexity of the 
circumstances associated with the complaints or the factors that 
determined the outcomes and sanctions' due to confidentiality.

But she told The Huffington Post: 'Nonetheless, the range of penalties described in the semi-annual report reflects our readiness to impose harsh sanctions when the findings warrant them.'

Yale was required to produce the semi-annual report after the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights launched a federal Title IX investigation the university's handling of sexual violence on campus in 2011.

The university avoided any disciplinary action for creating 'a hostile sexual environment.' Instead the investigation concluded in 2012 with a 'voluntary resolution agreement.'

This year, Yale was slapped with a $155,000 fine by the Education Department for failing to properly report all sexual violence crimes on campus.

Yale graduate Alexandra Brodsky, who was one of the 16 sexual assault victims who filed the Title IX complaint, was horrified to see Yale had allowed multiple students who have been found guilty of sexual assault to return to campus this fall.

She tweeted on Thursday: 'In Sept I'm returning to a campus where, just like when I was a freshman, rape is addressed with "written reprimands." What lovely Yale traditions: the Game, Mory's Cups, administrative tolerance for rape.'

Another student, Hannah Slater, told Jezebel: 'It's really irresponsible (for Yale) to let known perpetrators of rape stay on campus alongside the survivor and alongside other students who could potentially be victimized in the future. They're not making the campus a safer place.'

Slater, founder of campus discussion group, Sexual Literacy Forum, told The Huffington Post that victims regularly tell her they don't bother reporting sex crimes to the university because they don't trust they'll be taken seriously.

'Most of them don't use the Yale complaint system because they don't trust that their needs will be served, and this report proves them tragically right,' Slater said.

Brodsky told The Huffington Post she felt she had been let down not just by Yale but by the federal government, which has been heavily criticized for not coming down harder on the university.
