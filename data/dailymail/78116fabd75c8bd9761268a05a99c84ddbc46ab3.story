A distressed humpback whale who was trapped in fishing nets for more than eight hours has been freed after rescue efforts at The Pass in Byron Bay.

The rope was apparently wrapped around the creature's dorsal fin and tail, and was spotted at first light on Tuesday morning.

New South Wales Parks and Wildlife service kept and eye on the whale early in the day and in a joint effort with Queensland Fisheries officers managed to free the animal just before 4pm.

A National Parks and Wildlife spokesman Lawrence Orel told the Gold Coast Bulletin crews spent nearly two hours trying to release the entangled animal and the outlook for the whale is good.

Mr Orel also told the publication calm water conditions were ideal circumstances for the rescue to take place, and the operation was successful despite the chance the whale could have become very agitated.

The Guardian report that buoys were attached the humpback to slow it down, though it did try to get away from the crews working on cutting the ropes on a few occasions.

While the rescue was taking place people were urged to keep their distance from the whale as it could become stressed and agitated and it would be dangerous to get in the path of such a huge creature.

The 12-metre creature was not the only whale freed off NSW on Tuesday, with one more on the far south coast in Narooma also rescued later in the day.

On Tuesday evening, reports emerged of a third whale in distress at Palm Beach on the Gold Coast in Queensland. It's unsure whether this is the same whale freed in the afternoon.
