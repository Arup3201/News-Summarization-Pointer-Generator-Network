She is in the running to be this year's cover girl of the prestigious Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue.

And this is the first glimpse of Emily Ratajkowski as she prepares to grace the pages of SI once again.

The gorgeous Gone Girl actress stripped down to just a pair of bikini briefs while on set - and was snapped by editor MJ Day, who has been teasing fans about just who will be appearing in the edition.

Revealing: Emily Ratajkowski takes a dip while on vacation this month

She's back in SI: A revealing glimpse of Emily Ratajkowski from this year's Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit Issue - she's in the running to be the covergirl

Emily Ratajkowski of course made her name in the Robin Thicke video, but since stripping off, she's now become a celebrity in another respect. Starring in the highly acclaimed Gone Girl movie, Emily's career is now sure to come on leaps and bounds, despite the film not winning any accolades at the Golden Globes.

Emily was far more covered up at the event than we are used to seeing her in that video, donning an Escada spring 2015 dress.

The vibrant hue was popular at the event, favoured by Naomi Watts and Taylor Swift too.

Emily's asymmetric dress showed off her assets while the full length kept her look sophisticated.

Yellow is definitely the colour to don if you're keen to get noticed and will be great for the upcoming warmer months. So have a browse through the options below and bag a zesty dress of your very own.

Emily, 23, had a starring role in the raunchy Blurred Lines video, parading around topless in a spot seen by more than 324 million YouTube viewers. 

She went on to snag a role in box office hit Gone Girl, playing Ben Affleck's character Nick Dunne's mistress and her next appearance on the silver screen is in the movie edition of HBO’s Entourage, due out in June, in which she plays a version of herself 'on steroids', saying: 'I drive an Aston Martin, and I’m in full hair and makeup when the guys run into me on the street.' 

And she certainly is starting the year as she means to go on,  posting a picture of herself naked in a bathtub while on vacation this month.

Last year, Emily told of her excitement when she got the call to appear in Sports Illustrated, calling her fellow models 'Goddesses' and 'Venuses'.

She could well be this year's cover girl, according to sources, as could model of the moment Gigi Hadid, who was a 'rookie' in last year's issue. 

Model Hannah Davis, Derek Jeter's girlfriend, is also linked with a starring role in the edition, which comes out on February 9. 

Swimsuit editor MJ Day has been tantalizing fans about just who will appear in the issue. 

She's been putting up pictures of the girls - but cropping off their heads to maintain the mystery.  

Two-time covergirl: Kate Upton is a perennial SI favorite and appears again this year 

Glimpse: SI swimsuit editor MJ Day has been posting pictures of the girls - and this looks like Kate's beachy shoot

However, it looks like the ever-favorite Kate Upton - a two-time SI covergirl - has scored another shoot.

Asked if she had an all-time favorite SI Swimsuit cover, editor MJ said: 'I have lots of favorite covers; it’s really hard to pick just one! One I hold dear to my heart is the 2013 cover with Kate Upton shot in Antarctica. Can’t really beat that.' 

Models Jessica Gomes and Portuguese model Sara Sampaio are in the issue, and we know for sure that one of last year's covergirls, Lily Aldridge, is back - as Sports Illustrated is using a picture of her from her 2015 shoot to publicize the upcoming swimsuit fan festival. 

Lily's fellow coverstars Nina Agdal and Chrissy Teigen are also back.

Meanwhile, MJ Day is revealing this year's new rookies every day up until the cover's release.

So far, she has unveiled Erin Heatherton and Ashley Smith. 

The editor travels the globe for the swimsuit issue - and starts shooting the following year's issue is released.

She told the New York Times last March: 'I swear when we go out on shoots, we look like a traveling band of Gypsies. There’s me, my assistant, hair stylists, a model or two, our photographer, two photo assistants and sometimes our own TV crew. 

'It can be up to 12 or 15 people, and part of my job is to herd everyone and make sure we get where we’re going, which can include one location per trip, or sometimes two.

'This year, we shot on all seven continents, and it was crazy. Obviously, we don’t just take carry-ons. We have a lot of luggage. I have the cell numbers of all of the skycaps at Kennedy Airport and La Guardia, and I’ll call ahead and they meet us outside. I can’t tell you the number of times people in airports have asked if we were in a band or something. It’s kind of funny.'

'But what’s really amusing is watching reactions to the models. One of my favorite airport pastimes is people-watching, and watching people watch the models walk through the airport is hysterical. The models are obviously tall and gorgeous, in a preternaturally perfect kind of way. 

'People try to be cool and not stare at them, but they can’t help themselves. Men stare. Women stare. Children stare. Even babies stare.'

Rookie: Erin Heatherton makes her SI debut in the 2015 issue

Trying to hide: Erin Heatherton hides her face for editor MJ Day

'The longest trip I’ve taken was to a shoot in the Philippines. I took three flights, two car rides, two buses and a boat to the location. It took a total of 36 hours, door to door. With all of the luggage and crew, it was insane. I wanted to die by the time we got there. 

'The crew and I were dragging. The models looked just fine, which doesn’t seem fair.'
