For many of us, putting the phone on charge is one of the last things we do before going to bed.

One user of Reddit was awoken from his dreams to the stuff of nightmares as his phone exploded as he slept.

Vizionx1208 posted pictures of the destroyed Samsung Galaxy S3 smartphone, claiming he was 'awoken by a loud noise and a weird squeaking sound.'

Nightmare: The owner of this phone says they were awoken by a 'hissing' sounds and could smell burning

Sorched: The phone reached such a high temperature it left burn marks on the mattress

Molten: The battery pack had apparently become so hot it was liquid in form

He states the phone was on the verge of setting alight, although the room already was filling with smoke and had a pungent smell.

He was able to put out the smouldering phone by chucking a glass of water over it.

The phone had already burnt his mattress cover and left a small burn on his finger.

Although the pictures appear convincing and genuine, there have been reports of people deliberately setting their phones on fire simply to create attention.

Evasive action: The owner ended up having to pour water over the phone to stop the burning. He also burnt his finger

Hoax: There have been instances in the past where users have pretended their phone exploded. Samsung has not yet commented on this latest claim

Last year, a man from Ireland deliberately placed his Samsung Galaxy S3 in the microwave and then proceeded to claim that it was faulty.

Reacting seriously to the claim that 
their wildly successful smartphone might be faulty, Samsung enlisted 
Fire Investigations UK (FIUK) to determine the exact cause of the damage
 done to the smartphone.

The customer eventually admitted that the phone had been placed in the oven in an attempt to remove water damage from the unit.

A Samsung spokesman said: 'Samsung is aware of this issue and will begin investigating as soon as we receive the specific product in question.

Once the investigation is complete, we will be able to provide further details on the situation. We are committed to providing our customers with the safest products possible and are looking at this seriously.'
