Leading figures during the reign of the first Queen Elizabeth included Sir Francis Drake, Sir Walter Raleigh and William Shakespeare.

A list of ‘New Elizabethans’, by contrast, features Barbara Windsor, Billy Connolly and Simon Cowell.

DJs, fashion designers, pop stars and even shamed banker Fred Goodwin have also been selected by a panel of historians and experts for the list of 60 people said to have ‘defined’ the era of our Queen’s 60 years on the throne.

Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair are the only Prime Ministers to be listed, with the impact of the others during the reign of Elizabeth II not deemed significant enough.

Instead the list features Rupert  Murdoch, the under-fire head of News Corporation, footballer George Best who became an alcoholic, feminist writer Germaine Greer and even the DJ Goldie.

The full list was announced yesterday in advance of a Radio 4 series, The New Elizabethans, to mark the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee. It examines how this Elizabethan age compares with that of Elizabeth I.

Those selected were said to be ‘men and women whose actions in the reign of Elizabeth II have had a significant impact on the life of these islands, and/or given the age its character – for better or for worse’.

The house of Windsor: Barbara Windsor, the Eastenders actress, was named as one of the 60 people who have defined the Queen's reign. Tony Blair, right, was one of only two Prime Ministers named in the list

On the list: TV executive Simon Cowell and unexpectedly DJ Goldie have both made the list of 60 people said to have defined the era of the Queen's 60 years on the throne

Nearly 1,000 names were submitted to the BBC by the public for consideration. A panel including historian and journalist Sir Max Hastings and Bamber Gascoigne, the original presenter of University Challenge, reduced them to the final 60.

The Queen herself was added, despite serious debate on the panel whether she should qualify.

Fred Goodwin is believed to have been selected because he was both a leading banker and represented the greed that has come to symbolise the industry.

Recognition: Courageous Doreen Lawrence, mother of murdered teen Stephen Lawrence, and Indian-born author Salman Rushdie, pictured in 2008 were also chosen for the Radio 4 series

Doreen Lawrence, mother of murdered black teenager Stephen Lawrence, was selected for her courageous campaigning for victims of race crime. Bobby Moore and Sir Bobby Charlton, two of the heroes of England’s 1966 World Cup win, failed to make the list.

Instead George Best was chosen because as the first celebrity footballer he was said to have a wider influence on popular culture, before his life was destroyed by alcohol.

Perhaps the most unexpected entry is Goldie, the dance music DJ who has also appeared in East-Enders and Celebrity Big Brother.

James Naughtie, who will write and present 60 profiles of the New Elizabethans in the series, said they made up a ‘glittering mosaic’ of this country in the second half of the twentieth century, touching ‘every corner of our lives’.

The series will begin on June 11.

Nowhere: Despite Gordon Brown, left, presiding over the global financial crisis and John Major, right, signing the European Union's Maastricht treaty, there was no place for either in the list
