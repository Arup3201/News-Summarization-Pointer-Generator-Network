Egypt is facing threats to its aid payments and a tourism boycott amid international outrage over the jailing of three foreign journalists yesterday.

Sentences of between seven and ten years were handed to the trio for ‘spreading false news’ in reports for Qatar-based Al Jazeera that were deemed too sympathetic to former elected president Mohammed Morsi, who was ousted by the military last year.

David Cameron said that he was ‘completely appalled’ by the verdicts against former BBC correspondent Peter Greste, Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed, while Foreign Secretary William Hague summoned the Egyptian ambassador in London for crisis talks.

The trio were accused of supporting Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, which the authorities have declared a terrorist organisation

The three were arrested in December as part of a sweeping crackdown on Islamist supporters of ousted president Mohammed Morsi.

The trio were accused of supporting Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood, which the authorities have declared a terrorist organisation.

They also faced charges of fabricating footage to undermine Egypt's national security and make it appear the country was facing civil war.

The prosecution offered little evidence to back up the charges against them.

The journalists and their supporters have said they were simply doing their jobs, covering the wave of protests led by the Brotherhood against the military-backed government installed after Morsi was ousted on July 3 by then-army chief Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi, who is now the president.

The police crackdown on the protests has killed hundreds and put thousands more in prison.

'I swear they will pay for this,' Fahmy shouted angrily from the defendants' cage after the sentences were announced. Greste raised his fists in the air.

'They just ruined a family,' said Fahmy's brother Adel, who was attending the session.

He said they would appeal against the verdict but added that he had little faith in the system. 'Everything is corrupt,' he said.

The judge also handed 10-year sentences to two British journalists and a Dutch journalist who were not in Egypt and were being tried in absentia.

Two defendants among 14 others on trial in the case were acquitted, including the son of Mohammed el-Beltagy, a senior figure in the Muslim Brotherhood.

British ambassador James Watt, who was in court, said he was 'very disappointed' by the verdict.

'Freedom of expression is fundamental to any democracy,' he said.

John Kerry, the US secretary of state, speaking on a visit to Cairo, described the sentencing as ‘chilling and draconian’.

Conservative MPs called for an urgent review of UK and EU aid payments to Egypt. There were similar calls in the US, which has just handed Cairo a huge slice of foreign aid.

Tory Peter Bone said: ‘It’s fundamentally wrong to give taxpayers’ money to corrupt foreign governments that are imprisoning people for reporting facts. The Arab Spring is turning into a disaster.’

The other defendants were mainly students, arrested separately, accused of providing the Al Jazeera journalists with footage along with a variety of other charges, including belonging to the Brotherhood.

The latest official figures show that the UK gave £8.4 million to Egypt in 2012, mostly through the Foreign Office.

But Britain also contributes to a £4.2 billion EU aid package that was agreed in 2012

However, MPs also warned that, following the Leveson Inquiry, proposals for a form of state regulation of the British press made it more difficult for this country to lecture others about media freedoms.
