Yaya Sanogo can finally change his Twitter handle.

Before Wednesday night it was: @Yayasanogoal22 in homage to his Arsenal goal record. Credit to the young Frenchman for being able to laugh at his own expense.

It took a while - 13 appearances in total - but he is finally off the mark for Arsenal.

Arsene Wenger has shown huge faith in Sanogo when supporters - and even some of his team-mates - have doubted his ability.

With that rod off his back, maybe he can establish himself fully at the Emirates Stadium.

Jack Wilshere's loss has forced Arsene Wenger into rethinking his January transfer strategy.

The Arsenal manager is still prioritising the capture of at least two central defenders; a position the Gunners have been dreadfully short this season.

But Wenger is also now looking to purchase a defensive central midfielder to replace Wilshere - who could be out for four months if he needs surgery on his injured left ankle.

Bayer Leverkusen's Lars Bender remains Wenger's dream signing, but Sportsmail understands they are also showing an interest in Sevilla's Grzegorz Krychowiak, who could be cheaper option.

Their defensive targets include Celtic's Virgil van Dijk, Manchester United's Chris Smalling and Ipswich left back Tyrone Mings.

Here's a little known fact: Borussia Dortmund defender Neven Subotic once had a 10 day trial with Crystal Palace in 2006.

Iain Dowie was manager at the time of Subotic's stint at Selhurst Park. He arrived as a defensive midfielder, but his 6ft 3ins frame meant Palace viewed him as an imposing defender.

Subotic, who spent part of his childhood in the USA, played for the Eagles' sister club Crystal Palace Baltimore.

Palace wanted to sign the then 18-year-old, who held a US passport, but red-tape meant a deal wasn't possible after the club failed to secure him a work permit. Soon after Subotic signed for Mainz.

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain made his 100th appearance for Arsenal in Wednesday's Champions League encounter.

Quite an achievement for a player still only 21-years-old. There was conjecture about just how much the England man would play this season during the summer months.

He was touted as the fall-guy following Alexis Sanchez's arrival. But Chamberlain has already started 10 games for the Gunners this term.

It'll be interesting to see where he fits in once Mesut Ozil is fit again, though.
