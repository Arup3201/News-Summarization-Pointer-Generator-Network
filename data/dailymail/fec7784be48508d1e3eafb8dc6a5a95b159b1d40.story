A four-year-old girl was sent home from hospital without any treatment after being bitten by what her mother believes was a deadly false widow spider.

Amy Harris, 28, was stunned when doctors told her to take her daughter, Sophie, home and give her allergy tablets.

After the pain on Sophie’s back intensified, her mother eventually chose to squeeze the venom, which she suspected had come from a false widow, out herself.

Ms Harris took Sophie to Shrewsbury Royal Hospital, near their home in Baschurch, Shropshire, after the wound started to swell after an hour on Friday.

She told of her anger today, explaining that Sophie had come back from school complaining of something hurting on her back.

‘When I looked I discovered a lump of black in the middle with yellow around the outside about the size of a 5p piece,’ the mother said.

‘She said a spider bit her but because she is four and she’s got a wild imagination I didn’t know whether to believe her.

‘I’d read all about these spider bites and showed people on online forums pictures of the wound and they were sure it was a false widow bite.

‘They posted links to people who had been bitten by false widow spider’s and the bites looked identical to Sophie’s.’

When her daughter complained of further pain, Ms Harris decided to take her to the hospital.

‘They said we haven’t been given any warnings so it can’t be that serious,’ she said.

A number of false widow bites have been reported across the UK in recent weeks

Ms Harris accused medics at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital of sending her daughter away with a dangerous bite

‘The doctor checked her breathing and lymph nodes and just said take her home and give her some Piriton.

‘She was in agony and they just sent her on her way - I couldn’t believe I had to be the one to treat her.’

When she got home, the wound got ‘really nasty’ and, fearing the worst, the mother felt she had to deal with it and squeeze it out.

Sophie felt better within a matter of hours.

Her mother added: ‘I don’t understand why the hospital couldn’t have just done that in the first place.’

Ms Harris has not been able to catch the culprit, but believes a false black widow was behind the bite.

She is now worried about her younger children, Thomas, one, and Alfie, two.

She said: ‘Thomas isn’t walking yet so I’m not letting him on the floor as much as I would do because I don’t know if I’ve got them all. It’s a big worry.

‘The more I’ve heard about them and the people who have been bitten and needed surgery I felt really lucky that hers didn’t get to that.’

Sophie came home from school on Friday complaining of the pain coming from her back

A spokesman from Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust said staff did not know what had caused Sophie’s injury.

‘In a typical A&E Department we will see people coming in with reactions to stings or bites,’ they said.

‘When it is not clear or not known what the cause was, as in this case, we make a clinical assessment of both the site of injury and the effect on the patient.

‘In a case where there is simply a minor reaction, the course of treatment will be to use antihistamines and monitor the situation at home, and if it does not improve we advise people to contact their GP.

‘Generally stings and bites can be treated through self care at home and remedies such as antihistamines.’

Amateur footballer Steve Harris, from Devon, was bitten in bed last week by the false black widow

The
false black widow, which is said to be spreading further north due to 
warmer weather, has the worst bite of any spider in the UK.

There have been a spate of bites reported across the country in the past few weeks.

Amateur Devon footballer Steve Harris, for instance, had to undergo emergency surgery after a bite on his leg last week.

The spider is a cousin of the Black Widow and is about the size of a 50 pence piece.

It unleashes venom that can kill those who are allergic to it.

It first came to the UK more than 100 years ago in crates of fruit from the Canary Islands.

The
Natural History Museum’s Insect Information Service hears of about ten 
cases of spider bites each year, although no one in the UK has ever died
as a result of one.

The
distribution of the false widow spider is expected to increase 
northwards in the UK due, at least partly, to mild summers in recent 
years.
