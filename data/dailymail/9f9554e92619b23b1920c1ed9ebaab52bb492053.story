Regular viewers will know that yellow is very much the colour of transfer deadline day on Sky Sports News.

And in an amusing parody  for BT Sport, Robbie Savage  donned a bright yellow suit to advertise their own coverage of the closing of the window.

Usually, the male presenters on Sky Sports News sport yellow ties, while their female counterparts wear yellow outfits.

And it is something that their rival Barclays Premier League broadcaster have clearly picked up on.

Savage's brightly-coloured suit  caught the eye of many on Twitter, including Gary Lineker.

The Match of the Day presenter wrote: 'Good heavens! Transfer deadline duck.'
