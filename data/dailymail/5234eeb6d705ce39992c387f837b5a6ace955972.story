More DNA tests will be carried out on the weapon thought to have killed Meredith Kercher it was heard today as the bar owner wrongly accused of her murder claimed Amanda Knox is guilty.

Knox's second appeal trial began in Florence where the Italian judge agreed to test one DNA trace not previously examined because it had been deemed too small.

A court-ordered review in the first appeal trial discredited DNA evidence on the kitchen knife linked to Ms Kercher.

Italy's highest court in March 
ordered the new trial for American student Knox and her former Italian 
boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito, overturning their acquittals in Ms 
Kercher's 2007 murder.

Knox, now a 26-year-old student in Seattle, has not returned to Italy for the trial and she is she compelled by law to do so.

The appellate court hearing the new case could declare her in contempt of court but that carries no additional penalties.

'We refute the idea that because Amanda is not coming, that Amanda is guilty, that Amanda is using a strategy.

Lawyer: Francesco Maresca, representing the Kercher family, said Knox was present at Meredith's death

Family: Francesco Sollecito, centre, the father of Raffale Sollecito, was at the hearing although his son was not

'Amanda
always said she was a friend of Meredith's, Amanda has always respected
the Italian justice system,' Knox's lawyer Luciano Ghirga said before 
the trial opened.

Knox and Sollecito, now 29, were convicted and later acquitted in Ms Kercher's death.

Knox
served four years of a 26-year sentence, including three years on a 
slander conviction for falsely accusing a Perugia bar owner in the 
murder, before leaving Italy a free woman after her 2011 acquittal.

The
bar owner wrongly accused of killing Meredith Kercher today insisted 
that Amanda Knox is guilty of the British student's murder.

Patrick
Lumumba, who Knox initially suggested might be responsible for killing 
Meredith, told the hearing that he had suffered from the false 
allegation, which saw Knox convicted of slander.

'I say the same thing I said six years ago,' he said. 'I think she is guilty, and that is why she slandered me.'

Francesco Maresca, representing the Kercher family, said that the 
victim's relatives believed Knox was present at the scene of Meredith's 
death in the flat the two students shared in Perugia.

'I think she is talking too much, sincerely, and this attitude of continuous playing the victim is inappropriate,' he added.

Knox
and her one-time lover Sollecito served four years in jail for the 
murder of Meredith, who was found semi-naked with her throat slit in the
flat she shared with Knox.

Both were freed on appeal in 2011 but in March this year Italy’s highest court sensationally ordered them to face retrial.

In
June judges published the reasons for that decision, saying the ruling 
by the appeal court that freed them was full of ‘deficiencies 
contradictions and illogical conclusions’.

Knox has said that her decision not to attend the re-trial was ‘common sense’.

‘I was imprisoned as an innocent person and I just can’t re-live that,’ said told NBC television.

In
a memoir released earlier this year, Knox sought to portray herself as a
naive young woman railroaded by a foreign justice system and not a 
callous sexual deviant as she was painted in many reports after her 
initial conviction.

Knox is not obliged to attend the retrial and can be represented by her lawyers. 

If found guilty, she would be able to appeal again, but Italy could apply for her extradition if that failed
