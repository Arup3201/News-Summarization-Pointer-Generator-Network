Aviva Premiership club London Irish have confirmed rugby director Brian Smith's departure from the club.

Irish said Smith has been granted early release from his contract - which was due to expire on June 30 this year - on 'compassionate grounds' and he will return to Australia for family reasons.

Exiles forwards coach Glenn Delaney will take on the role of interim head coach between now and the end of this season.

Former England attack coach Smith, 48, had two spells with Irish as rugby director.

He was in charge between 2005 and 2008, guiding the club to a third-place Premiership finish and the European Challenge Cup final. He also took Irish to the 2008 Heineken Cup semi-finals, when they were beaten by Toulouse at Twickenham.

Smith then spent three years with England, before returning to Irish.

'My family has to be my priority right now, which is why I have asked to be released from my contract early,' he said.

'I have thoroughly enjoyed my 10-year association with London Irish and I will look back on my time with fond memories.'

Irish are currently 20 points above Premiership bottom club and red-hot relegation favourites London Welsh, effectively securing their top-flight status for another season.

Delaney, meanwhile, will be assisted by Richard Whiffin and Mark Tainton, and the club's academy coaching team of former Exiles players Nick Kennedy, Declan Danaher and Paul Hodgson.

Irish executive chairman David Fitzgerald added: 'London Irish is grateful to Brian Smith for the contribution he has made to the club.

'He led us to the greatest experience we've had to date of European rugby, and introduced some great players to the club.

'We believe that, following Sunday's results at Madejski Stadium and Kingston Park (where Newcastle beat London Welsh), our Premiership status for next season is more or less secure and allows us to focus on preparing for next season.

'All involved with London Irish, especially the new owners, would like to personally thank Brian for his considerable contribution over the last two-and-a-half years, and wish him and his family well for the future.'

Irish say they will announce a new head coach 'in due course'. Former Ireland boss Declan Kidney is thought to be in the frame.
