Former Manchester United manager David Moyes is to be questioned by police over claims he attacked a reveller outside an upmarket wine bar after being taunted about losing his job.

The 51-year-old, who succeeded Sir Alex Ferguson as boss at Old Trafford but only lasted nine months, apparently snapped after receiving a torrent of abuse at The Emporium, in Clitheroe.

The alleged victim is 23-year-old joiner Joshua Gillibrand.

Investigation: Moyes was present at the bar in Clitheroe at the time of the assault

Incident: Joshua Gillibrand claims he was attacked at just after 10pm on Wednesday night

Moyes is said to have been enraged when one drinker goaded him about his recent sacking and called him 's*** and something about having never won anything', a witness said.

The 51-year-old was sacked by United in April after a disastrous first season at Old Trafford which saw United surrender their Premier League title and fail to win a trophy.

In the resulting furore, a table was almost upturned and glasses sent smashing on the floor during a brief scuffle near the bar entrance.

Mr Gillibrand, a joiner, allegedly suffered a lump on the side of his head and a bruised shoulder in the confrontation but did not need hospital treatment.

Police today confirmed they had launched an investigation into the fracas and were set to speak to the ex-Everton boss.

Location: The Emporium wine bar in Clitheroe, Lancashire, where the alleged assault took place

The incident happened at around 10pm on Wednesday after Moyes and friends – including Derek Shaw, the chairman of Preston FC while Moyes was manager there - had enjoyed a meal at Piccolino in Clitheroe before crossing the road and making their way to the nearby Emporium wine bar.

A group of revellers were standing outside the bar enjoying a drink after a warm day but when they saw the former manager arrive they began making abusive remarks.

A witness said: ‘Moyes started to head with his mates in but he was being barracked by drinkers outside who were giving him grief.

‘He was getting a bit of lip from a couple of blokes and then one guy, who was a bit drunk, said something about him being s**t and having never won anything.

‘Moyes kept his head down and carried on walking towards the door with his friend and everyone thought he was just ignoring the banter.

'It was crazy. No-one could quite believe what had happened. We were stunned. He’s obviously had enough of all the abuse he’s been getting.’

A spokesman for Lancashire Police said: ‘Officers attended the bar at about 10pm on Wednesday, May 21 and it was reported that a 23-year-old local man had been assaulted by a 51 year old man. He did not require hospital treatment.

‘Inquiries are ongoing and we are speaking to a number of people to try to establish the circumstances. There are a number of differing accounts which we need to work through to try to establish exactly what has happened. No-one has been arrested at this stage.’

A spokeswoman for the Emporium said: ‘There was an incident outside the building. However it did not affect any of our customers or staff and has been dealt with by the police.'

Another witness told the Clitheroe Advertiser and Times that what happened was nothing more than a scuffle.

'Around 10pm, one of the men [in Moyes' group]
 went outside, perhaps for a cigarette, when he became involved in a 
heated argument. A table was knocked over, but that was as serious as it
 got.

'David Moyes and the others went outside to see what was happening and the police arrived incredibly quickly.

'The group involved in the scuffle seemed to be in their 20s. I don't know what was said, but it obviously caused some offence.'
