If a man in Maryland was self-employed as a bank robber he simply may have been including his child in take your son to work day or perhaps he just couldn't find a babysitter.

Charles County authorities say that a man in his 30's or 40's accompanied by a boy between the ages of 10 and 13 attempted to rob a Sun Trust bank on Friday but may have decided to change their minds at the last minute.

The older man handed a note to the bank teller which said something along the lines of 'give me all your money' and implied that he had a weapon.

Not a piggy bank: This man accompanied by a child allegedly gave a bank teller a note demanding she give him all her money then left without saying a word 

Before the bank teller could do anything to respond the threat, the man allegedly left with the boy without demanding any cash.

'Something may have scared him, Diane Richardson, a spokeswoman for the sheriff’s department told The Washington Post.

'Or he may have had a change of heart,' she said of the bizarre decision to leave a threatening note then walk away without stealing any money.

Richardson said that witnesses were unsure as to whether the boy was aware of the robbery or if he was perhaps acting as a lookout for the older man.

'We don’t know if this young man knew if anything was going on,' Richardson said.

Police has a surveillance video of the event but have not identified any suspects.
