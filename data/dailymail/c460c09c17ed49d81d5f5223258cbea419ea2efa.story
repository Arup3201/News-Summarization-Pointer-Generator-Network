Harvey Weinstein has revealed that his new son's name, Dashiell, is a reference to his first date with wife Georgina Chapman.

The movie producer, 61, told CBS: 'On the first date that I took my wife 
out . . . she walks into the restaurant and she trips and falls right on her
butt.

'I go first, "There is a God!" because that evened the 
playing field right away and secondly I said to her, "That was the 
opening scene when Myrna Loy walked into William Powell in The Thin 
Man."

Baby boy:  Miramax co-founder Harvey Weinstein, 61, has revealed tht he named his first son Dashiell after author Dashiell Hammett, because it reminds him of his first date with his designer wife, Georgina 
Chapman

'I said, "Georgina, meet [the novel's author] Dashiell Hammett," and she read The Thin Man.'

Dashiell, who was born on April 11, is his father's fifth child but first son.

He is brother to 37-year-old Ms Chapman's daughter India Pearl, two, as well as Emma, 18, Lily, 16, and Ruth, 11, Mr Weinstein's daughters from a previous marriage.

The Miramax co-founder admits he is delighted to finally have a son, mostly because he is 'so tired of going to Forever 21 and Abercrombie . . .

'On Sundays I wake up and I go, "The game’s on!" and [my daughters go], "At the mall, you’re driving us to the mall."'

Not that they want his style advice, he adds.

'I'm so tired of going to Forever 21 and Abercrombie on Sundays'

'They say, "Dad, park three miles [away], we don’t want to be seen 
with you. Meet us at the pizza store four miles over here because we’re 
embarrassed of you and you’re annoying."'

Mr Weinstein met British-born Marchesa co-founder Ms Chapman in 2004  - the couple wed in Connecticut three years later.

When Mr Weinstein announced that his wife was expecting again in December, he said: 'We don’t know the sex. It could be Harvey and five daughters. I’d be happy either way.'

Ms Chapman, who spent months expertly hiding her baby
bump under loose-fitting red carpet dresses, told Celebrity Baby Scoop that her pregnancy had been 'perfect' and 'easy.'

The former model, who established Marchesa in 2004 with Keren Craig, also discussed juggling children with a high-profile, and demanding business.

'I make sure I carve out time to be with my daughter. My family is my number one priority,' she told the website in December.

'India comes into the office with me 
most days – she has her little area with a desk and she draws. I leave 
later in the mornings now and spend the mornings with her, so I do see 
her.

Hollywood couple: Ms Chapman already has a 
two-year-old daughter, India Pearl, with Mr Weinstein - who also has three daughters from a previous marriage

'She spends a lot of time with me at work.  I don’t know how that’s going to work once she’s at school – I’m going to miss her, it’s going to be hard.'

She admitted she would 'love to' design a separate line for children, but, she said, 'I don’t know whether that will happen any time soon.'

The evening wear designer, who regularly has dresses the likes of Jessica Alba, Renee Zellweger, Jennifer Lopez and Hedi Klum, said being pregnant actually helps the design process.

She explained: 'It’s funny, because I sometimes feel that I’m most creative when I’m pregnant.

'I guess it’s because I am physically creating at the same time. I just keep going – the show must go on. You just work through and obviously some days you’re a little more tired than you normally might be, but I do feel very creative when I’m pregnant.'
