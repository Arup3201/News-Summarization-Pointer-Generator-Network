Forget the zippy motorbikes to get the delivery of burgers and fries to arrive on your doorstep as fast as possible - McDonald's fast food giant has pulled out the big guns with flashy sports cars.

A white Lamborghini and red Ferrari were parked outside the South Melbourne outlet which was one of the first suburbs to trial the home delivery service back in July.

The gleaming cars attracted a lot of attention from impressed customers who were taking photos on their phones of the new high-end delivery vehicles.

The extravagant delivery service comes as the global net income of the major food supplier has recorded a profit drop of 30 per cent in the last quarter ending September 30.

As competition against other fast-food suppliers rises, and a food scandal in China damaging the company's reputation in Asia, McDonald's has tried to redeem themselves through a number of campaigns that promote it as a healthy, classy option.

Rob Moodie, a professor of public health at the University of Melbourne told Daily Mail Australia that he believes this continues to remain far from the truth.

'One would hope these changes are because we as consumers are more discerning and demanding of healthy food, because that's the only way that we would ever receive a change in McDonald's rather than through government regulation,' Professor Moodie said.

'They are the masters of marketing, they don't come much better than Ronald McDonald for instance – he's the 21st century pied piper.

Meanwhile, 20 restaurants throughout Brisbane will join the home delivery trial during November and December.

There are least seven Sydney outlets and three stores in Melbourne that have already jumped on board the online delivery service trial. 

Many of the items on McDonalds regular menu will be available with the delivery service, including Big Macs, french fries and healthy options like wraps and salads.  

Customers must order a minimum of $25 and are charged a $4.95 delivery fee.
