Sasha Obama has arrived in China with an unusual accessory: a thumb brace.

The 12-year-old was seen wearing a brace on her right hand that only covered her thumb when she de-planed in Beijing on Thursday.

Calls to the White House about the cause of her injury were not immediately returned, but given the Obama girls' love of sports, an athletic accident could be a likely explanation.

Sasha, 12, is clearly wearing a brace of some kind on her right thumb but the White House has not yet commented on the cause

Sasha plays basketball at Sidwell Friends School- a fact that was revealed because President Obama often coaches as a parent volunteer.

Mrs Obama has previously stated that both Sasha and Malia must play at least two sports in a year, including one team sport. Earlier reports stated that Sasha also enjoyed taking classes in gymnastics, tap dancing and tennis when they lived in Chicago before moving to Washington.

The girls have joined their mother and grandmother Marian Robinson on a trip to China during their spring break from Sidwell Friends School.

They landed in Beijing on Tuesday and will be traveling to two more cities- Xi'an and Chengdu- over the course of the next week. 

Growing girls: Sasha, who was 7-years-old when her father arrived in office, has clearly kept with the family genes as she has grown dramatically taller in recent months

Red stair looks: Both Sasha and Malia opted for high-waisted skating-style skirts, though older sister Malia, 15, chose to go the more glam route by selecting a silver pleated version as compared to Sasha's red velvet skirt

Despite her injury Sasha was clearly in a great mood as she arrived in China

Though they are off from school, that doesn't mean that Malia and Sasha will skimping on their work as Mrs Obama previously said that she and her husband make the girls write reports about the trips they take.

Mrs Obama's chief of staff Tina Tchen, who is a first-generation Chinese-American, told The New York Times that the family trip featuring three-generations of the Robinson family will be appreciated by the Chinese because of the importance they place on tradition.

This is both Mrs Obama and the girls' first trip in China- and Mrs Obama's third international trip without her husband since becoming First Lady. They were welcomed by the Chinese First Lady Peng Liyuan.

Fashion aficionados have always keyed into Mrs Obama's sartorial choices but as the girls have grown up- both in age and in height- they have become trendsetters in their own right.

Malia, 15, and Sasha wore similar high waisted skating-style skirts as they deplaned Tuesday, with Sasha opting for a red velvet version while Malia chose the glitzy route with a silver pleated option.

'I'm just so proud of how they have managed all this with poise and grace and maturity,' Mrs Obama said in an interview with ABC's Robin Roberts earlier this month.
