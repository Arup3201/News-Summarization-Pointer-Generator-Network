al-Shabaab reportedly set off this car bomb, seen Sunday in Mogadishu 

NBC News reported its sources revealed 'a military drone launched Hellfire missiles at at least two vehicles in a remote area of southern Somalia, with al-Shabaab's top leader, Ahmed Abdi Godane, believed to have been the target.'

The U.S. action comes after Somalia's government forces regained control of a high security prison in the capital that was attacked Sunday by seven heavily armed suspected Islamic militants who attempted to free other extremists held there.  

The Pentagon statement did not indicate whether the U.S. action was related to the prison attack.

Somali officials said all attackers, three government soldiers and two civilians were killed.

Mogadishu's Godka Jilacow prison is an interrogation center for Somalia's intelligence agency, and many suspected militants are believed to be held in underground cells there.

The Somali rebel group al-Shabab, which is linked to al-Qaida, claimed responsibility for the attack that shattered a period of calm in Mogadishu after two decades of chaotic violence.

The attack started when a suicide car bomber detonated an explosives-laden vehicle at the gate of the prison, followed by gunmen who fought their way into the prison.

According to CNN, Somalia's Information Minister H. E. Duhulow said 'These terrorists groups are against the security improvements we are currently experiencing here in Mogadishu. We say to them that these foiled attacks strengthen our forces and prove their bravery to the people of Somalia.' 

It was al-Shabab gunmen who attacked the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, with guns and grenades last September, killing at least 67 people.
