Kellie Maloney, 61, formerly known as boxing promoter Frank Maloney, shocked the sports world - and her family  - when she announced that she had embarked on a new life as a woman.

But the news, as well as her appearance on Celebrity Big Brother, led to greater understanding of their father from her estranged daughters - so much so, that they now want her back in their lives on a daily basis after a two-year rift.

Today she spoke to Lorraine Kelly with her 19-year-old daughter Sophie about the impact the news had on their family, as she prepares for her final operations next year.

By her side: Ex-boxing promoter Kellie hit the headlines in August when she announced she was having a sex change from Frank to Kellie. Today she spoke to Lorraine for the first time with her 19-year-old daughter Sophie about the impact the news had

Kellie recently told the Sunday Mirror that being on Celebrity Big Brother after nearly two years of living alone and as a recluse from her family was a tremendously positive thing. 

Speaking to Lorraine about starring on the reality TV show, she said: 'I think it's helped me, it's just thrown me into the world. I had time to sit back and think about it.

'I've just had to get on with it and that's what helped me and other transgender people.'

We are family: Kellie Maloney has revealed that her stint on Celebrity Big Brother led to her daughters Sophie, right, and Lilly, left, to having a greater understanding and acceptance of her new life as a woman

On air: Speaking about whether she had an inkling of her father's woes, Sophie, 19, said: 'I knew that she was unhappy, very angry and upset a lot but I had no idea why'

Opening up: Speaking about her father's news, Sophie said: 'I much prefer Kellie,'  before explaining that she still calls Kellie 'dad'

Research: Sophie said that when she found out the news, she and her sister spoke about it for ages and looked it up and tried to figure it out

Opening up about how being on the show helped bring her daughters back into her life, she said: 'My family, they are the most important people. 

'Without being rude, if the public hadn't accepted me, I could've got through that but if my family rejected me, that would've been the hardest thing to get through.

'Thankfully my three daughters, granddaughters and some of my nieces and nephews, my aunts, have been fantastic.'

Speaking about whether she had an inkling of her father's woes,  Sophie, 19, said: 'I knew that she was unhappy, very angry and upset a lot but I had no idea why.'

Her girls: Kellie said to her daughters: 'I'm always going to be your dad so if you want to, call me dad'

Happiness: Kellie said she is extremely happy and the operation will be the final piece of the jigsaw, then she can start living her life properly

Describing how she felt when she found out the news, she said she was 'confused'.

'I remember making a joke and my dad was crying and then I went home with my sister and we spoke about it for ages and looked it up and tried to figure it out.'

But now, she says it's 'the best feeling'. 'I much prefer Kellie,' she laughed before explaining that she still calls Kellie 'dad'.   

'I said to them, I'm always going to be your dad so if you want to, call me dad,' added Kellie. 'It doesn't really matter.'

Sharing her plans, Kellie revealed that she's having surgery in Belgium in November to have her nose made slightly smaller. 'My youngest daughter told me my nostrils were too big,' she said.

'I was always concerned about my chin but they tell me it's within the female parameters and the gender doctor can do the full operation, hopefully, and breasts in January.'

She added: 'I am living really well now, I am pleased that the public are really good to me and my daughters are great. The operation will be the final piece of the jigsaw, then I can start living my life properly.

'Most of my friends are retiring but I am living life all over again.'

Kellie is also sharing her story and supporting others within her support group, talking at events and helping other transgender people.

She even revealed that she's toying with the idea of getting back into boxing to prove that women can do it too. 

'At least it will stop me shopping,' she joked.
