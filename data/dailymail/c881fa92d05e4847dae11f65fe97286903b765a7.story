For months, astronomers have been following a comet that's zooming towards a blisteringly close encounter with the sun.

But only today at 18.35 GMT will they know if ISON will survive its closest approach to our star, when it fights the sun's fierce heat and gravitational pull, which could destroy it.

If ISON, which has been branded the 'comet of the century' does survive, scientists expect it to put on its best and brightest show yet during December, when it will appear low in the sky at dawn in the UK.

In this frame grab taken from enhanced video made by Nasa's STEREO-A spacecraft, comet ISON, left, approaches the sun on November 25. ISON, which was discovered a year ago, is making its first spin around the sun and will come the closest to the super-hot solar surface today

Here, Comet ISON enters the field of view of the ESA and Nasa's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory on November 27. In this picture, called a coronagraph, the bright light of the sun itself is blocked so the structures around it are visible. The comet is seen in the lower right and a giant cloud of solar material, called a coronal mass ejection is seen billowing out under the sun

Some scientists fear the delicate comet has already started to disintegrate, even before it grazes the 'surface' of the sun, 1.2 million kilometres away.

Dr Dan Brown, an expert in astronomy at Nottingham Trent University, told MailOnline that when the comet enters the sun's hottest outer layers it will be exposed to a temperature of several million degrees.

It is now thought to measure less than a mile (1.6 
kilometres) wide and could fry and shatter, as a victim of the sun's 
incredible power.

Professor Tim O'Brien, associate director of Joderell Bank Observatory, told the BBC: 'It's like throwing a snowball into fire. It's going to be tough for it to survive.

'But luckily, it's a big object and it moves fast, so it won't spend too much time close to the Sun. There is a lot of uncertainty.'

Professor Mark Bailey, from Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland, said: 'It's going to be exposed to the worst that the Sun can throw at it. 

Comet ISON was discovered by two amateur Russian astronomers in 2012 and will come within 730,000 miles of the Sun today

Appearance: Comet ISON entered the view of NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory on Nov. 21, 2013, where it can be seen with Earth, Mercury and comet 2P/Encke

'It will be getting exposed to more and more intense solar heat, and that will start to sublimate the ices (turning them into gas) at an increasing rate.'

But if the comet does survive as astronomers hope, it is set to put on an incredible show and appear at its brightest yet.

The heat from the Sun will excite the dust and gas in the comet's core, allowing it to blaze a trail, where it will appear low in the skies at dawn in the UK during December.

Dr Brown said: 'Astronomers around the world are hoping that ISON will become an amazing sight for the naked eye in the first half of December. People at home can also capture a glimpse if it survives.

'Just look out for it half an hour before sunrise from December 1 onwards. It will be visible low in the east south-eastern horizon.'

Earlier this week, NASA has released a high resolution image of the streaking comet that look like a swimming tadpole.

It was captured by the H-1 camera on board NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory on November 21. 

Nasa said ISON, which is officially labelled as Comet C/2012 S1, appeared to still be intact in its video and can be seen in these images along with Earth, Mercury and Comet 2P/Encke.

The tails streaking out from behind both comets can be seen moving along with the steady stream of particles – called the solar wind – that flows out from the sun.

A composite image from the European Southern Observatory's TRAPPIST telescope in Chile shows Comet ISON streaking toward the sun on Nov. 15. The image combines four different 30-second exposures of the moving comet in different wavelengths

Should
 it survive, ISON, pronounced EYE'-sahn, will be visible with the naked
 eye through December, at least from the Northern Hemisphere.

Discernible at times in November with ordinary binoculars and 
occasionally even just the naked eye, it already has dazzled observers 
and is considered the most scrutinised comet ever by NASA.

But the best 
is, potentially, yet to come.

Dr Brown told MailOnline: 'This close encounter with the sun offers a unique opportunity for astronomers to analyse the composition of a comet. Comets are icy, dusty snowballs - the remains from the formation of our solar system 4.5 billion years ago.

'The long tail containing the material frozen in the comet and released through the heat of the sun offers astronomers the chance to identify different elements.

'It has already been bright enough for astronomers to capture amazing pictures. However, if the comet survives its burning close encounter with the sun it may have a huge and impressively long tail with a brightness that might make it an easy to spot object even with the naked eye.

'This happened in 1965 with the comet Ikeya Seki that had an enormously long tail; but some comets, like Lovejoy three years ago, have been ripped apart during their close encounter by the sun's gravitational force. 

'The magic limit for survival of the comet seems to be the size, which has to exceed 2 km so it does not get boiled away or ripped apart by the sun. ISON is estimated to be that size, so we should all cross our fingers and await our early Christmas comet,' he said.

Ison, which has been dubbed the 'comet of the century',has been visible to the naked eye this month. German amateur astronomer Waldemar Skorupa recorded this image from Kahler Asten, in Germany, on November 16

Detected just over a year ago, the 
comet is passing through the inner solar system for the first time.

Still fresh, this comet is thought to bear the pristine matter of the 
beginning of our solar system.

It's
 believed to be straight from the Oort cloud on the fringes of the solar
 system, which is home to countless icy bodies - most notably the frozen balls of 
dust and gas in orbit around the sun known as comets.

For
 whatever reason, ISON was propelled out of this cloud and drawn toward 
the heart of the solar system by the sun's intense gravitational pull.

The closer the comet gets to the sun, the faster it gets and in January, it was clocked at 40,000 mph (64,000 kph). 

By last Thursday, the comet had accelerated to 150,000 mph (240,000 kph) but by the time ISON slingshots around the sun, it will be moving at a mind-boggling 828,000 mph (1,332,000 kph).

The place to see the ‘comet of the century’ is in a clear dark sky where the horizon is unobstructed, such as in the countryside.

It can be seen with the naked eye, but binoculars will highlight details such as its tail, streamers and bumps in the surface.

It should be seen before dawn in the eastern sky.

Ison will pass within 1.2 million miles of the sun’s surface today at 18:35 GMT.

Whether it survives or is torn apart, humans have nothing to fear.

The comet will venture no closer to us than about 40 million miles (64 million kilometres), less than half the distance between Earth and the sun.

The closest approach to Earth will occur on Boxing day - if the comet survives.

Then it will head away in the opposite direction forever, given its anticipated trajectory.

ISON is named after the International Scientific Optical Network, used by a pair of Russian astronomers to detect the comet in September 2012, but it officially is known as C/2012 S1, which indicates when it was discovered.

Take heart: The 'C' means it is not expected here again.

The comet, top right, has so far been photographed through telescopes and long exposures but is expected to be visible to the naked eye throughout December and January. It could be the brightest for 100 years

The comet has been creating a spellbinding cosmic spectacle of late as ice in its body vapourises and forms a distinct bright tail
