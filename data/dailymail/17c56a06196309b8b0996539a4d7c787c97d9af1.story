Ordeal: Jeanette Akua, pictured in her high school days in South Africa, was handing out leaflets in Johannesburg when she was attacked

X-Factor star Jeanette Akua has revealed she was kidnapped by a gang of armed thieves who held her at gunpoint for two days.

The Miss Dynamix star said she feared for her life during the terrifying ordeal which happened when she was in her native South Africa.

Miss Akua, 21, was standing at a taxi rank in Johannesburg handing out flyers.

The gang approached her and a friend and dragged her off them from the street into a room in a taxi office.

The terrified girls were told to hand over money in return for their release.

Miss Akua, who was 18 at the time, was working in the notorious Randburg district of the town, which has high levels of muggings, gun crime and car-jackings.

She was locked up for 48 hours and given no access to food or water.

She said she was singled out by the yobs because she was from a 'good home'.

The singer, who is now a beautician in the UK, was only freed after she contacted the employment agency she was working with and they agreed to pay a £400 ransom.

Now competing in the live shows of the Saturday night talent show, she said the ordeal has made her feel lucky to be alive.

Recalling the incident, the singer told The Mirror: 
'I thought they were going to kill us. In South Africa people are 
murdered for less than 2p. You hear these stories but you never think it
will happen to you.

New life: The singer, pictured centre with Miss Dynamix, said she was lucky not to be killed after the gang put a gun to her head and demanded money

'They
made us sit in the corner, refused to give us any water or let us use 
the phones. They had guns. My friend understood them a bit. They were 
saying, 'This is a gold mine for us.' They could tell we came from good 
backgrounds.

'I was so traumatised I could hardly speak. I am lucky to be alive.'

Attention: The South African born star is enjoying the trappings of fame now, but she was singled out in her home land for being from a 'good home'

She went to the police to report the incident, but the beauty assistant said officers laughed it off, telling her she should be grateful for being alive.

Her three-piece female group had to pull out of last week's show when pregnant bandmate Sese Foster, 22, had to be rushed to hospital when she collapsed in rehearsals

But Jeanette has confirmed that Miss Dynamix will be back to full strength for this week's live shows.
