Eating Disorder: Bradley Squires, five, with mum, Kerri, 23, outside Bradley's school, Dunston Primary School in Chesterfield

A five-year-old boy with a rare eating disorder has been banned from eating his required diet of mash, custard and yoghurt at school because of health and safety regulations.

Bradley Squires suffers from oral hypersensitivity, which means he can only eat foods which have a smooth texture.

His special requirements includes three bags of frozen mash potato and 40 yoghurts a day at a cost of £77 a week.

But staff at his primary school have barred his mother Kerri, 23, from bringing in the prepared meals in a thermos flask.

The unemployed mother also asked if staff could put together the specific meals in the school kitchen, but they refused the request because teachers have not had 'appropriate hygiene training'.

Miss Smith, who lives in Chesterfield, said: 'We came across a thermos flask and it would keep the food at the same temperature but they said it was a health and safety issue.

'Just letting him take it in a thermal flask could change Bradley’s life and change mine.'

She has been forced to make and deliver Bradley’s lunch to Dunston Primary School in Chesterfield everyday for more than a year.

Miss Smith has made more than 200 trips to the school, costing more than £4,000 a year, and thought she had found a solution with a heated thermos flask.

The youngster is violently sick if he
eats anything lumpy and was advised by doctors to eat mashed potato for
lunch everyday at school.

His illness is so bad that he is sometimes sick when he sees other people chewing food.

Her son's everyday needs has also meant she has not been able to find a job and is struggling to pay for the food as a result.

She added: 'I am angry and upset because I have been doing this for years for nothing.

'I had to make him sandwiches that he wouldn’t eat and then he had to come home for dinner.

'This has made me and Bradley suffer for two years because he has not been doing the same as the other children.

'It’s just really hard, it has been a struggle.

Special Diet: Bradley Squires, 5, can only eat frozen mash potato, Amrbosia custard and yogurt

'His food costs me so much and I’m not getting any help.

'I’m angry, upset and disappointed with the school as I think they could have been more helpful and supportive.'

Kerri got a letter from the headteacher at the end of last term saying it was ‘not appropriate for the school to prepare food’ and it did not have a ‘facility appropriate to meet all the safety standards for food preparation and storage.’

Letter: Bradley's primary school have said it would 'not be appropriate' to prepare food for his specific diet because the school does not have the facilities and staff have not received the correct training

The letter stated: 'It is not appropriate for the school to prepare food as has been requested by yourself.”

Staff do not have the hygiene training to prepare Bradley’s lunches, it added.

Miss Smith said: 'It costs me £11 a day. He can eat up to 40 yogurts and three bags of Aunt Bessie’s frozen mash a day.

School gates: Staff at Dunston Primary, Chesterfield, have said Bradley already has food he likes in his packed lunch and it did not require his mother to bring in mashed potato

'I can’t buy myself any shopping.

'It’s ridiculous the amount of money it costs to feed him.

'I’m having to live off cheap foods such as noodles and soup. I am spending more than I have got coming in.'

Bradley has suffered from allergies and psychological eating difficulties since he was a baby and has constantly been in and out of hospital.

'Some days he is really weak and poorly through it and others he eats constantly,' Miss Smith added.

'I just worry about his health. I worry that he is going to be weak.

Hypersensitivity
is characterised by reactions to specific sensations such as food 
touching the back of the throat, causing a gag reflex.

It makes feeding very uncomfortable and unpleasant for children,

Hypersensitivity
may also cause other reactions in the body, such as, muscle stiffening which limits the bodies movement 
patterns.

Children with severe or long term hypersensitivity may develop adverse reactions to feeding.

For example, the sight of a spoon may cause a spasm or turning of the head, the smell of food may cause a gag reflex.

Some children may also develop responses to meal times and refuse all food, regardless of whether they touch or taste it.

'He only tried mashed potato because the texture was so smooth. If he finds a lump he would be sick.

'From the age of two-and-half he has eaten nothing but mashed potato, fromage frais and custard.

The single mum goes through a gruelling daily routine in a bid to improve Bradley’s relationship with his food.

'He tries to touch it, feel it and smell it and I am trying to get him to handle food every day,' she said.

'I was hoping they would have sent me a letter to arrange something for the start of the new term.

'Someone needs to help us because me and Bradley will be homeless if they don’t. If they don’t give me the decision I need at the school I can’t get a job.

'If they don’t say that they can cook his food on site then I don’t know what I am going to do.'

Bradley has to go to Chesterfield Royal Hospital regularly, where his condition is monitored.

He is given iron and vitamin supplements to help his diet and cannot be referred for mental health treatment until he is seven.

'It has taken three-and a-half-years to get him to bite a custard cream. If the biscuit is broken he won’t eat it.'

Dunston Primary and Nursery School acting headteacher Paul Burgess said: 'We’ve been working closely with this child’s family to accommodate his special dietary needs and will arrange a meeting with them to try to resolve the issue.'

Miss Smith now hopes to resolve the issue in a meeting with the school.
