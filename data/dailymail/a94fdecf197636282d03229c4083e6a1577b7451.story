Some of Mesut Ozil's performances at last summer's World Cup might have been criticised but the midfielder's decision making off the pitch cannot be faulted since Germany's triumph in Brazil.

Having helped Joachim Low's side to victory over Argentina at the Maracana in July, the Arsenal star decided to spend his bonus money on operations for 23 seriously ill Brazilian children.

Each surgery was a success and Ozil, who is currently recovering from a serious knee injury, was delighted with the results of his generous donation.

Speaking after picking up a Laureus Sport for Good award in Berlin on Wednesday night, Ozil said: 'We had the idea to help 23 children, because we had 23 players in the [Germany World Cup] squad.

'And they underwent surgery, which was successful. I am very thankful. The doctors did a great job. I am very happy because it goes well for the children.

'This award will get a very special place at my home.'

Ozil was not the only man with Arsenal links to pick up an award from presenters Wolfram Kons and Kathi Woerndl, with former Gunners goalkeeper Jens Lehmann earning himself a Laureus Media gong for his impact on the sporting world.

Ozil, who is due to return to action for the Arsenal early next year, also confirmed that he plans to continue helping deprived children.

He added: 'Thank you for this Laureus award. 

'I promise that this will be the beginning of further projects for disadvantaged children.'
