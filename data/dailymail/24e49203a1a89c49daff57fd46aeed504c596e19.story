A woman has been found dead in a lake at the University of East Anglia, police have confirmed.

The body was found in the lake known as the UEA Broad shortly before 9am today at the university's Norwich campus.

Police say that an angler, who is said to have been fishing for carp in the lake overnight, spotted the the body floating face down in the water.

Detectives say that initial inquiries carried out by the university have accounted for all students.

A Norfolk Police spokesman said: 'Officers were called to the University of East Anglia shortly after 8.40am following reports a body had been found in a lake on the site.

'Emergency services are on scene and the area has been sealed off.'

A tweet posted by the university a short time after the body was discovered read: 'UEA will be fully supporting the police with their inquiries.'

A spokesman for the university added that there are no further details available at the moment.

Emergency services are said to have taken the body from the site, which is popular with dog walkers and joggers, at around 11am.

Police would not comment on whether the incident was linked to swimming but a cordon was put in place around a small beach area.

There are several no swimming signs at various pointsÂ  around the beauty spot.

The lake area was quiet today but several people could be seen swimming and paddling in a nearby river.

An angling competition was due to take place at the lake yesterday evening.

The University of East Anglia has around 15,000 students enrolled on courses during term time.

It is marking its 50th year as a university this year.

The majority of students have left the campus for the summer holidays, but the university hosts a series of summer schools for students preparing to apply for university and an International Summer School for foreign students between terms.

Graduation ceremonies and leaving balls were held at the university last month.

The lake is normally open to members of the public.
