Using nothing but his hands and a rake, this artist's creations look amazing - until the tide comes in.

Tony Plant, 50, of Newquay, Cornwall, drew these eye-catching pieces of artwork in the sand at Watergate Bay, Bedruthan Steps and the Great Western Beach along the Cornish coast.

The father of two spends hours on different coastlines creating eye-catching geometric patterns that can be seen far into the distance from cliff tops - but are quickly washed away by the incoming tide.

He has been working on beaches for more than two decades to make this kind of temporary art, taking him from his native south-west England to the likes of Scotland, France, Spain and Sri Lanka.

Mr Plant said: ‘I've been doing this a long time just for me with an audience of one. I just think of the art as non-precious things.

'They're temporary. The reason for being there is the landscape is constantly changing.

‘I love that kind of interaction I've always worked with landscapes.

'My work is based in process so it leads me to different areas. It's a creative licence to do anything anywhere you want.’

He graduated from the Chelsea College of Art and Design - formerly known as the Chelsea School of Art - in central London with a fine art painting degree in 1990.

Mr Plant's personal information area on his Facebook fan page says: 'Tony Plant creates unique interventions in the natural landscape to be seen and experienced.'
