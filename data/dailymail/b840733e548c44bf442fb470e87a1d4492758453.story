A schoolboy suffered a horrific ten-inch leg wound after being tackled during a football match by a player wearing bladed boots.

Goalkeeper Kavan Ryan, 13, collapsed on the pitch when a fellow player sliced his leg open as he went in for a tackle with the bladed football boots.

The teenager was rushed to hospital but the bleeding was so heavy his father thought he may have severed an artery and feared he may die of blood loss.

Injured: Kavan Ryan, 13, was rushed to hospital after he suffered a ten-inch wound to his leg when he was tackled by a player wearing bladed boots during a football match

Police are now investigating an allegation of assault following the incident. 

His father Rob Copestake, 48, said: 'I've never seen anything like that, and I've played a lot of football.

'My big fear was that it had hit a main artery and Kavan could've bled to death.'

Kevan was playing in a friendly game between his team Codland Colts and Alvechurch Youth on August 14 when he suddenly collapsed.

Shocked spectators ran on to the pitch to find the huge gash torn in his thigh after the tackle from an Alvechurch player who was wearing the controversial bladed boots.

The match was abandoned as police and paramedics were called by the team's manager Andy Taylor, 41, and Kavan was rushed to Alexandra Hospital in Redditch, Worcestershire.

Doctors needed to place ten large stitches in the deep wound and kept Kavan under observation for 24 hours.

The Alvechurch player who caused the injury was sent off for serious foul play but a senior FA official said the tackle was recorded as reckless rather than violent.

West Mercia Police has confirmed they have launched an inquiry after the incident was logged as an assault.

Officers have even seized the 13-year-old opposition striker's football boots as part of the investigation.

So far no arrests have been made. 

Mr Copestake, who was on the touchline at Redditch's Abbey Stadium when his son's leg was sliced almost to the bone, is now calling for bladed studs to be banned.

The supermarket worker, who lives with wife Samantha, 42, a nurse in Solihull, West Midlands, said: 'I was in a daze, to be honest. I cried.

'Kavan was such a brave lad. I think he was in shock, but he kept on telling the people around him, "look after my dad". He was worried about me.

'A lot of people felt physically sick. Even the linesman had to turn away because he felt ill.

'I just don't want any other youngster to go through this.

'I can't help thinking the injury 
would not have been so severe if the other player was wearing good old 
fashioned moulded studs.

'We don't know when Kavan will play again - he's hobbling at the moment. When it happened, he said he wanted to quit football.

Concerned: Kavan Ryan with his father Rob Copestake who was worried the blade had severed an artery because there was so much blood

'But it's a one-off injury, something like that will never happen to him again. We do know he will be scarred for life.'

His
comments echo recently retired Manchester United manager Sir Alex 
Ferguson who claimed Swansea defender Ashley Williams could have killed 
star striker Robin van Persie when he kicked the ball at his head last 
season.

But schoolboy Kavan yesterday shrugged off the incident, which happened just 20 minutes into his debut for the club.

Wound: The gash on Kavan's left leg before it was stitched up

He said: 'I'm OK really, I just can't wait to get back out on the pitch again.

'It's
just one of those things really. I ran out to smother the ball and he 
came running through, didn't even slide, he just stamped on me.

'I got up and started hopping around and pulled my shorts up to just see my skin hanging off.

'That's when I started screaming.'

Coldland Colts manager Andy Taylor, 41, believes the cut was just centimetres away from an artery.

He said: 'It was literally centimetres away from an artery - that is how close it was to being something much more serious.

'I think bladed boots should be banned from kids' football.

'Kids wear them on paths and gravel and the blades become sharp, almost like a weapon.'

The referee's report from the abandoned game said the tackle was a result of 'youthful over-enthusiasm'.

A
spokesman for the Alvechurch club described the injury as 'terrible' 
but stressed there was no malice behind the challenge that caused it.

He said: 'I think people reacted to the injury - and, yes, it was very bad. But it was not the result of violent play.'

A spokesperson for West Mercia police said: 'We can confirm we are investigating an allegation of assault in relation to this incident.

'There have been no arrests made but the football boots the 13-year-old was wearing at the time have been seized as part of the investigation.'

The horrific injury was similar to that caused to Manchester United star Wayne Rooney by the bladed boots of Fulham's Hugo Rodallega last season.

Blades are meant to provide players with better grip than their studded counterparts

But the boots have come under fire for being both dangerous to player's opponents as well as to themselves.

A study by researchers at Dundee University found that the traditional stud was safer in a series of tests involving amateur players.

Researchers claimed the traditional stud helps to distribute the pressure being placed on a footballer's feet while the cleats increase the loading on the front of the foot where soccer stars are prone to metatarsal injuries.

Meanwhile bladed boots were 'relatively more harmful' due to the unnatural increased loading under the lateral half of the foot.

Professor Rami Abboud, of the university's Institute of Motion Analysis and Research, said: 'The additional pressures placed on that area of the foot predispose it to injury.

'Our study showed that studded boots can be considered safer, as the pressure distribution across the foot and the pattern of pressure progression mimicked the normal motif, whereas the same was not true of bladed boots.'

In 2005, Sir Alex Ferguson called for the boots to be banned after Roy Keane broke a bone in his foot.

Speaking at the time, he said: 'The shot of the injury shows the shape of a blade stud on Roy's foot. The bladed studs are a danger.

'We have strong views about this, we don't allow our players to wear them as they can cause serious injuries.

'We have photographs in the dressing room of some of the injuries caused by blades. Some of our academy boys had bad injuries, including some terrible facial injuries.

'Hopefully the fad will evaporate and they will think of something else.'

But eight years on, bladed boots are still popular among both professional and amateur players.
