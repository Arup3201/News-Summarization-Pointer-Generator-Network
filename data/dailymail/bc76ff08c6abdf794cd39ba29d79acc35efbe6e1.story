An American sailor on trial for the rape of a Darwin woman, was a friendly guy who made her and her friends laugh, a court has heard.

Hugh Patrick Malone, 23, has pleaded not guilty to sexual assault, indecent assault and depriving a woman of her liberty.

It is alleged that on September 4 last year he was drinking and dancing at Monsoon's bar in Darwin's CBD with a trio of local women who had gone out with some American sailors they had met earlier that week. 

The sailors were from the USS Denver, docked in the port.

It is alleged that on September 4 last year Hugh Patrick Malone was drinking and dancing at Monsoon's bar (pictured) in Darwin's CBD with a trio of local women who had gone out with some American sailors they had met earlier that week. After having sex with one woman he tried to have sexual with another despite her saying no

The court heard that Malone had sex with one woman earlier in the evening before returning to the bar and 'pestering' her friend, the complainant, for sexual favours, which she declined.

He then told her he needed to pick up a bag from his hotel room to check out before curfew. She agreed to accompany him there on the way to the hotel room of the man she was seeing, another American sailor.

But it is alleged that when they arrived he pulled her into the room and sexually assaulted her.

ABC News reported, crown prosecutor Matthew Nathan said Malone 'picked her up, put her on the bed and digitally penetrated her, but stopped when she started to cry.'

Afterwards the complainant called her friend Nina Ah-Wong, the court heard on Tuesday.

In a 'jumpy voice' she told her that 'Malone just tried s*** with me', and the following day recounted the assault again in more detail, using the word 'rape' and saying that he 'tried to stick it in' and penetrated her for five to 10 seconds.

Afterwards, Malone allegedly said to the woman 'please forgive me, you're such a beautiful girl, I have a family'.

ABC News reported that Malone apologised via Facebook and Mr Nathan read part of the exchange in court which also said. 

'I thought I couldn't have you and I really want you but I just went to your friend and that was the wrong choice, you're so f***ing hot'.'

There was no indication of an attraction between the complainant and Malone, Ms Ah-Wong told the court.

She said although the woman was intoxicated 'she still knew what she was doing'.

She told the court Malone was 'a good guy and fun to be around'.

ABC News also reported Malone's defence lawyer Tom Berkley gave a brief opening submission.

'This is a case of regret, not a case of rape,' he said.

The trial continues.
