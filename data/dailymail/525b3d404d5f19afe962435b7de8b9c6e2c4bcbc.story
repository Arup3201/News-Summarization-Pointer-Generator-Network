A dolphin has been spotted near downtown New York after straying from the ocean and swimming up the East River.

Biologists say the dolphin, first seen yesterday near the Upper East Side of Manhattan, appears to be healthy despite being alone and away from its usual ocean habitat.

The species has yet to be identified but it is believed to be either a common dolphin, an Atlantic bottlenose dolphin, a white-sided dolphin or a white-beaked dolphin.

Marine experts are slight concerned as dolphins are sociable animals and rarely leave their pods

Kimberly Durham, the rescue program director at the Riverhead Foundation for Marine Research and Preservation said: 'I've seen some video of it swimming, and it seems to be swimming fairly strong.

'It appeared to be swimming around a fairly large area of the river, which was an encouraging sign.

'I do get nervous when I see a lone animal,' she added, explaining that dolphins are social animals that typically do not separate themselves from their pods.

A biologist from Riverhead was planning to take a boat out on the river along with officials from the state's Department of Environmental Conservation to photograph the dolphin, identify it and to assess its health.

It was seen swimming near the Robert F. Kennedy bridge in an area roughly bounded by the East 90s of Manhattan, Randalls Island and the end of Astoria Boulevard in Queens.

Police said they were no longer on the scene after notifying Riverhead, which oversees the monitoring of marine animals that enter city waters.

In January, a sickly male common dolphin died after becoming stranded in Brooklyn's polluted Gowanus Canal.

The Riverhead Foundation said on its Facebook page:

'We have documented four occasions of reports of cetaceans in or near the East River since 2010. Three of those events were in February and March timeframe. In all four events, intervention was not deemed necessary and the animals did leave the area without further sighting reports.'
