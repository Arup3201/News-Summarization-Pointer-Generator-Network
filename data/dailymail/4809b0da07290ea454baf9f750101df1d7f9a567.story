A pardon for thousands of Irish soldiers who joined the British to fight Nazi Germany will help make amends for the shameful way they were treated after the Second World War, Ireland's Justice Minister has said.

The Irish Government has enacted legislation to grant an amnesty to the former troops - who were blacklisted and branded deserters at home.

Ahead of the historic move, Alan Shatter said tens of thousands of Irish people put their lives at risk during the global conflict in the fight against fascism and tyranny.

'The Bill is being enacted in 
recognition of the courage and bravery of those individuals court 
martialed or dismissed from the Defence Forces who fought on the Allied 
side to protect decency and democracy during World War Two,' he said.

'It
 gives important statutory expression to the apology given by me on 
behalf of the state last year for the shameful manner in which they were
 treated.'

Mr Shatter 
said the pardon would make an important difference to thousands of 
families in Ireland and goes some way to right the wrongs of the past.

'Unfortunately,
 many of the individuals whose situation is addressed in this Bill did 
not live to see the day that this state finally acknowledged the 
important role that they played in seeking to ensure a free and safe 
Europe,' he added.

Mr 
Shatter has already apologised to the ex-soldiers, who were dismissed en
 masse from the Irish Army under special powers introduced during the 
Second World War, known as the Emergency in neutral Ireland.

Branded traitor: Paddy Reid (left) was one of the thousands of Irishmen who joined the British Army to fight Nazi Germany

Paddy Reid was the son of a deserter and grew up in Ireland an outcast.

He was shunned as a schoolboy and branded a traitor because his father fought Nazis for the British Army.

Now, at 62, the soldier's son has nothing but pride for his father of the same name.His one regret: that Paddy Reid senior died before legislation was finally passed vindicating him and others for their bravery during the Second World War.

'Those men did what they believed to be right and they are now vindicated,' Mr Reid said. 'They did nothing wrong and they paid a high price for it throughout their lives.'

Barely 16 when he enlisted, the soldier boy was blacklisted and branded a deserter for serving as a gunner for the British Royal Artillery.

He returned home in 1946 and struggled for years to find work, living hand to mouth in the deprived Docklands area of Dublin.

His wife died at just 39 as the hardship and struggle to feed their eight children took its toll, and it was 15 years after his return before he was granted proper employment, driving a horse and cart for a steamboat company at the docks.

'It took all those years to find work and when he did, he never missed a day in his life,' Mr Reid said of his father, who died in 1984 aged 64.

'He worked through every flu and sickness. He was just so relieved to be employed - the sort of thing you take for granted.'

The family lived like social pariahs right up to the 1960s, with the children bearing much of the brunt in the classroom.

'The teachers would let you know that you didn't belong,' said Mr Reid, who now lives in Balbriggan, Co Dublin. 'They would have been very pro-Republican and they made a point of singling you out because you weren't really Irish, you betrayed the country.'

He said his father was just a boy when he joined the British Army, and paid for that decision his whole life, but he never regretted it.

'The thing that he did regret was the lives lost in the war. That stayed with him to his dying day - the memories of fighting the Japanese. There was a lot of death. And when he was dying himself, he felt a lot of sorrow for the Japanese soldiers he killed.

'How the soldiers were treated in Ireland was just so petty in comparison.'

Mr Reid, a community worker who counsels and teaches literacy, said his family knew no different from the discrimination they endured. It was normal to be shunned in the community, particularly by those considered to be well-off and the 'so-called educated', he said.

'But now there's a great sense of vindication. Those soldiers did what they did and they fought with bravery. They should be remembered for that.'

'Deserters': Many in Ireland believed the soldiers were needed at home, where troops are seen surveying a creamery in Wexford after it was bombed by Nazi warplanes in a violation of the country's neutrality

The Defence Forces (Second World War
 Amnesty and Immunity) Bill 2012, passed in the Dail today, provides for the granting of an amnesty
 and immunity from prosecution to 5,000 Irish soldiers who fought with 
the Allies.

They had been found guilty by a military tribunal at the time of going AWOL.

It is expected to be signed into law by the Irish President Michael D Higgins 
  in the next few days.

Special
 powers brought in - which became known as the starvation order - saw 
the deserters barred from state jobs, refused military pensions and 
faced with widespread discrimination.

Mr
 Shatter has referred to the soldiers as idealists and said people's 
understanding of history has matured and that it was time for 
understanding and forgiveness.

Apology: Justice Minister Alan Shatter said the pardon for thousands of Irish soldiers would go some way towards righting the wrongs of the past

In 2006 26 Irish soldiers who were shot at dawn for military offences during the First World War were formally pardoned by the British Government.

The pardon was prompted by the years the Irish Shot At Dawn Campaign spent trying to prove the troops - many of whom were still in their teens - should never have been killed.

The campaign won the support of the Irish Government, which submitted a report to the British outlining the background to each of the executions in 2004.

Legislation was enacted in Britain to clear their names in November 2006.

Ireland remained neutral during the Second World War, but that did not stop thousands of soldiers making the decision to leave the Irish Army and the country behind to join Allied troops on the front line.

And it was not just Irish troops that joined forces with the British and other Allied leaders on the battlefield as the war rumbled on.

The U.S. was neutral early in the war, although it began providing increasing levels of assistance to the Allies before declaring war on Japan in 1941 following it's attack on Pearl Harbour.

It went on to become the primary Allied power in the Pacific Theatre as well as, politically, the leader of the western Allies in forming NATO.

Belgium declared its neutrality at the outbreak of war, but joined the Allies after Nazis marched through the country as part of its invasion of France in 1940.

Brazil maintained its neutrality until 1942, when it sided with the Allies. In 1944 Brazil became the only Latin American nation to send troops to Europe when it dispatched the 25,000 strong Brazilian Expeditionary Force to fight on the continent.

The Netherlands declared its neutrality at the start of the conflict in 1939, but was invaded by the Nazis the following year in the face of fierce resistance. The Dutch joined the Allies and their surviving naval and armed forces joined in the defence of East Asia. Dutch troops fought alongside the Allies in landmark struggles including the Battle of Britain.
