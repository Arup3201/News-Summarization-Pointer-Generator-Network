Britain’s economy will not prosper unless its ‘mediocre’ education system is overhauled, a hard-hitting report says today.

Failing schools and poorly performing teachers lead to a ‘waste of human resources on a grand scale,’ causing long-term damage to the UK, the scathing document says.

Local councils which do not let failing schools close must see their wings clipped, and the system for assessing teachers must be revamped, it argues.

Written by a Nobel Prize-winning economist as well as former members of the Bank of England, the report from the London School of Economics calls for radical change to get the UK growing again.

It says ‘short-termist’ banks that refuse to lend to small businesses are suffocating innovation.

It also blames ‘years of inadequate investment’ and ‘political procrastination’ over the UK’s ageing transport and energy infrastructure for holding back growth.

The symposium has spent the last year looking at ways to help the UK’s moribund economy, which is now teetering on the edge of a triple-dip recession, grow in the long term.

The report says: ‘After years of inadequate investment in skills, infrastructure and innovation, there are longstanding structural weaknesses in the economy, all rooted in a failure to achieve stable planning, strategic vision and a political consensus on the right policy framework to support growth.’

The potential of thousands of children from poorer backgrounds are being squandered by underperforming schools, it says.

‘Our failure to provide adequate education to children from disadvantaged backgrounds constitutes a waste of human resources on a grand scale.

‘It holds back economic opportunities and is detrimental to growth,’ the report states.

Co-author Professor Tim Besley, a former member of the Bank of England’s influential rate-setting body, said: ‘Rarely are skills thought of as a growth issue. But catching up with Australia or Finland would lead to very significant increase in income for the UK.’

He suggested doubling teachers’ probation periods from two to four years, and assessing them more on the job rather than intensely at the start of their career.

‘We need to focus more on how schools are dealing with disadvantaged children – such as those on free school meals. That is where the big gains in growth will come from,’ he added.

It should be easier for underperforming schools to shrink in size, meaning fewer children join them each year, the report also says.

It wants local councils to allow failing schools to shrink and successful schools to take on more pupils.Vocational skills are ‘particularly poorly developed’ and should be made more available through more apprenticeships, it adds.

The UK’s economy will lag until ‘short-termist’ banks begin lending to small businesses again, the report also says.

A lack of competition among lenders is stifling badly-needed investment in innovation and holding back the recovery.

The government must make it easier for new banks to enter the market, and high street giants such as Lloyds and RBS could even be broken up to improve competition as a last resort, it says.

Despite cutting-edge science, small and medium-sized enterprises cannot get access to funding which could turn their ideas into reality.

It says small British firms which ‘punch above their weight’ need to be prioritised by the government’s new Business Bank.

It wants to make obtaining banking licenses easier, and remove other barriers to entry so that the pool for businesses to choose from is expanded.

Professor Besley said breaking up existing banks to create more players in the market was ‘an option’ that should only be considered as a last resort if all other schemes to improve lending fail.

The report also slams ‘repeated political procrastination’ over large infrastructure projects.

‘Nowhere is the problem of UK infrastructure better illustrated than by airport capacity in the South East, where generations of politicians have prevaricated to a point where there is a serious risk to London’s position as a major hub,’ it states.

It calls for a new infrastructure strategy board to be created to decide on the most badly-needed projects, as well as an infrastructure bank to help secure financing.

‘The UK has been incapable of building enough houses to keep up with growing demand,’ it says, and also suggests that road tolls could be introduced to ease congestion.

In response to the report, business secretary Vince Cable said: ‘The Government is implementing an industrial strategy in partnership with business to tackle the very issues the LSE’s Growth Commission report identifies.

‘The two most important points coming out of the report are the need for continued investment in skills and innovation, which the department is committed to.

‘Measures like the £1billion business bank to improve access to finance, a £75million package of investment to fund research-intensive and innovative SMEs, investing in record numbers of apprenticeships, and sweeping away red-tape will help create economic growth.’
