The live-in boyfriend of an Indiana mom who disappeared last year has been charged with her murder even though the woman’s body has never been found.

The alarm was only raised about Kelly Armstrong, 28, when her sister conducted her own search after not having heard from her in weeks.

Armstrong’s boyfriend and father of her child, Travis Funke, now 34, eventually confessed to police that he killed Armstrong by hitting her in the head with a hammer but he thought it was all a dream.

Missing: Though Kelly Armstrong's boyfriend admitted that he killed her, no physical evidence has ever been found except from some blood stains on the carpeting of the Indiana trailer the couple shared

The case against Funke has been complicated as police have been reluctant to follow up due to a lack of hard evidence- and diminishing resources.

The latest change has been an upgrade in Funke’s charge, as he originally faced a voluntary manslaughter charge but now heads to court with a full murder charge.

Adding to the problematic twists in the case is the well-being of Armstrong and Funke’s child, who has been in care of Armstrong’s family since Funke was arrested for an unrelated crime in late September of last year.

Armstrong’s sister Shelly Rush travelled to Armstrong’s home in Kokomo, Indiana in August 2011 after she hadn’t heard from her sister in an unusually long amount of time.

On top of that, Armstrong’s boyfriend Funke was giving Rush unclear answers, continuing to say that when Rush called, Armstrong had just stepped out of the house, or was unavailable to speak, and he never knew when she would be back.

Charged: Now Travis Funke, 34, is charged with Kelly Anderson's murder, months after he admitted to hitting her repeatedly with a hammer though he initially thought it was only a dream

Though she alerted Kokomo police that she was concerned about her sister’s welfare during that August trip, no real breaks in the case came until September 28, 2011 when police responded to the home where Armstrong and Funke lived.

At the time, Funke was wearing an 
ankle monitoring bracelet for criminal activity that has yet to be 
released, and police arrived at the home because the bracelet had been 
cut off. Funke was taken into police custody, charged with attempted 
escape, and sent to the Howard County jail.

The Kokomo Tribune reports that in October, Funke told a fellow inmate that he tried to kill Armstrong.

That
tip prompted a search warrant of the trailer that Armstrong and Funke 
shared and police found blood stains on the carpet and bedroom that 
matched that of Armstrong.

For
some unknown reason, police only interviewed Funke directly in January,
and that was the first time that he confessed to killing Armstrong 
directly to authorities.

The
affidavit states that Funke told police that ‘he and Kelly had been 
fighting for three days’ leading up to her reported death around July 1,
2011.

WISH TV reports that the fight was over prescription pills.

‘Funke
stated that he fell asleep on the couch and he awoke to Kelly hitting 
the couch with a hammer. Funke stated that he believes that Kelly hit 
him on the head with the hammer and knocked him out.

‘Funke
stated that, when he came to, Kelly was dead on the floor and bleeding 
from the head. Funke said that he has memories of hitting her in the 
head with a hammer but thought that it was a dream.’

The Huffington Post
reports that he told police that he put a plastic bag over her head, 
wrapped her body in a tarp, and put it in a garbage container that was 
picked up later that day.

Trouble: The two-year-old child shared by Anderson and Funke was used as a part of a now-revoked plea deal that police had offered Funke in exchange for more clues about Anderson's body

During the interrogation process, Funke directed police to a local landfill and after the spent six days looking through 6,000 tons of trash, they still found no clues relating to the case.

Because the body has never been found, Funke was originally charged with voluntary manslaughter.

Another aspect of the case has been the couple’s son, and Funke tried to bargain with prosecutors over releasing further details about the murder in order to secure custody of the 2-year-old child.

After learning of the prospect that the child may go back into the care of the accused murderer, Armstrong’s family were predictably upset and petitioned the courts for the plea deal to be taken off the table.

The next formal verdicts in the case will come when it goes to a jury trial on August 21, but until then the fight between the Armstrong family and the local police will likely continue to play out, as they blame Howard County Prosecutor Mark McCann with failing to properly inform the Armstrongs about the details of the plea deal.

‘This case is so screwed up,’ Kelly’s father David Armstrong told the Kokomo Tribune.

‘Something needs to be done.’
