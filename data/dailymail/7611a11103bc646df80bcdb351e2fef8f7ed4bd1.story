Covered in blood and mud and clad in a bulky suit of armour with heavy chainmail protecting his head, there’s nothing measly about Ron Weasley’s new role.

Rupert Grint, who played Harry Potter’s Hogwarts pal, looks unrecognisable in these exclusive pictures taken on the set of his new film Enemy Of Man – an adaptation of Shakespeare’s Macbeth.

Rupert plays Ross, a Scottish nobleman and friend of Macbeth. In Shakespeare’s play, Ross is a minor character who serves as a messenger to the major players. But if these pictures are anything to go  by, the manly 25-year-old’s role  looks more robust.

From Ron to Ross: Grint started working on the Harry Potter films in 2000 when he was 12 years old

In one shot we see Rupert riding into battle atop a black steed,  while another sees him caked in mud and blood against a background of flames.

It’s a far cry from his magical adventures in the Potter films. Rupert began playing Ron – opposite Daniel Radcliffe as Harry and Emma Watson as Hermione – in 2000 when he was just 12 and went on to star in all eight films.

He is worth a reported £24million thanks to the Potter franchise and an expanding property portfolio.

Enemy Of Man is due out next year, and Rupert is currently filming on location in Britain. 

Enemy of Man, directed by Vincent Regan, stars Sean Bean as Macbeth

Charles Dance plays Duncan in the film, an adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth

The film’s director Vincent Regan – best known for his acting roles  in the movies 300 and Troy – said he wanted to make a film that Shakespeare would have made had he been alive.

Regan, who also wrote the screenplay, said he was ‘stripping back  the dialogue and cranking up the action for the timeless tale of war, regicide, betrayal and ultimately revenge’.

The film also stars Charles Dance as Duncan and Sean Bean as Macbeth.

The role of Lady Macbeth is still to be cast.  It is a running joke among Bean’s fans that the 54-year-old actor  dies in nearly every role he takes  – most recently losing his head  as Eddard Stark in the hit TV series Game Of Thrones, which also stars Dance.

And as he is playing Macbeth, it’s not looking good for Sean in this film either...
