An Alabama minister who confessed to having sex with church members without telling them he had AIDS is fighting through the courts to keep his job.  

Circuit Judge Charles Price yesterday said he will rule within a week on whether Reverend Juan McFarland can return to Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Montgomery or whether a temporary ban from the church will become permanent.

McFarland's attorney argued that the church approved bylaws in January 2013 giving the pastor his job for life. He said a vote that decided to ban McFarland from the church in October was improper. 

Reverend Juan McFarland, who confessed to having sex with church members without telling them he had AIDS, is fighting through the courts to keep his job

McFarland, right, has argued the Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church approved bylaws in January 2013 giving him his job for life and that a vote leading to him being banned from the church in October was improper  vote that decided to ban McFarland from the church in October was improper

An attorney for the church's deacons and trustees argued that McFarland pushed through the 2013 bylaws improperly and that the October vote was valid.

McFarland had served the church for 23 years before he confessed to his congregation that he suffered from AIDS. 

In October Judge Price issued a preliminary injunction -  which had been sought by the deacons and trustees of the church - requiring McFarland to return his church keys and church-provided Mercedes and to stay away from the place of worship. 

Church members hugged and prayed after the ruling. 'Now we've got the church back, and the healing can begin,' said Lois Caffey, a member for 21 years, said at the time.

After that ruling, McFarland returned to the church and met with leaders in a private session. He then turned in his keys and left, less than an hour ahead of the judge's deadline.  

Earlier the preacher had confessed to his affairs, his AIDS diagnosis and that he had been abusing drugs in a series of sermons that stunned church-goers.

Parishioners reacted with astonishment, and some urgently sought tests to see if they had been infected.  Some called for the reverend to be jailed.

Following McFarland's confessions, the church's board of trustees chairman Lee Sanford said the challenge now was to reunite the 170 active members of the congregation.

He said:  'I'm confident with God's help we will be able to do that.'

The plaintiffs in the lawsuit said the congregation voted to fire McFarland after his confessions but that he refused to leave and changed the church's locks and how the church bank accounts could be accessed. 

The boards of deacons and trustees sued McFarland after he preached on October 12 despite the vote to fire him a week earlier.

One of the plaintiffs, Deacon Nathan Williams Jr, said church leaders had no suspicions about McFarland until he delivered sermons in August and September, revealing his dark secrets.

McFarland has said that God had directed him to make the confessions.   

Williams said that the congregation first tried to help the pastor but that when it didn't work, members took a vote on whether to fire him. He said some were upset that McFarland tried to fire several longtime church officials and others were concerned about taking communion from the ill minister or having him around their children. 

Price said the courts have no role in religious matters, but they sometimes have to step in when congregations can't settle their differences over control of buildings and money. 

Judge Price said at the first court hearing: 'If it could be resolved in the church, it would have been already.'
