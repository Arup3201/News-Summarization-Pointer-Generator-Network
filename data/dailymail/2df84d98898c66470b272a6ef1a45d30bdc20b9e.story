A barmaid says she is so scared of her wardrobe that she has to turn it away from her bed in case something jumps out.

Kirstie Hughes, 20, can't even face looking at wardrobes in shops after being traumatised in childhood by a terrifying horror film.

She now refuses to watch even beloved children's films such as The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, Monsters Inc. and E.T., because they all feature wardrobes.

The phobia first arose when she was 10 years old, and it was not until last year that she summoned up the courage to buy a wardrobe herself.

'There was a scene in a film I watched and a boy was dragged into a wardrobe and ever since I have been scared of them,' Miss Hughes said.

'Old wardrobes like the one in Narnia are my biggest fear, they just look really creepy.

'I have to walk straight past the wardrobe aisle in big furniture stores.'

After she bought her first wardrobe, Miss Hughes, from Merseyside, painted it white so it would 'look less scary'.

And she keeps it facing away from her bed because of her irrational fear that something might jump out.

Caution: Miss Hughes checking inside her wardrobe to make sure there is no danger

'I use drawers as much as I can to avoid using them and I have to have my bed facing away so I don't have to look at them,' she said.

A few months ago, she thought her worst nightmare was coming true when she heard scratches from the inside of a wardrobe at her boyfriend's house.

'I was staying at my boyfriend's house and I didn't know but his cat had got into his wardrobe,' she said.

'I could hear scratching coming from inside it and I just froze up and couldn't move.

'It took me a while to go back in his room because I was that freaked out, it was horrible.

'My friends and family just laugh at me and think it's a bit strange - nobody takes it seriously, they think it's a joke, but I do genuinely have a phobia of wardrobes.'

She added: 'Even though I am still terrified of wardrobes I've had to force myself to get one because I was literally going through three sets of drawers a year due to breaking them because I have that much stuff.

'It was my boyfriend who got me them because I couldn't bear to go shopping to look for some. I only agreed to have a wardrobe if it was painted white so they looked less scary.

'It still terrifies me now if I hear a bang or a strange noise I automatically think it's coming from the wardrobe.'

Phobia of wardrobes is so rare that it does not even have a scientific name.

Psychiatrists say that while the most common fears are claustrophobia, agoraphobia and fear of flying, it is possible to become scared of anything.

The usual treatment for a debilitating phobia is behavioural therapy, which aims to reduce the patient's anxiety by helping them get accustomed to the thing they are scared of.

In the most extreme cases, patients can be prescribed anti-depressants to help them deal with their fears.

Kirstie Hughes is not the only person whose life has been affected by an unusual fear of an everyday phenomenon.

Last month, shop assistant Mike Amess admitted that he had a crippling phobia of reality star Kim Kardashian.

He said that his condition started after he watched her notorious sex tape as a teenager in an attempt to stop himself being gay.

Melissa North, a 22-year-old student, has a phobia of cheese, and breaks out in a cold sweat when she gets too close to it.

She says she finds it difficult to go to the supermarket, because she is desperate to avoid the cheese counter.

Faith Watson, from Suffolk, has a problem which is even closer to home - her fear of loud noises means she can't stand hearing her boyfriend eat.

After receiving an official diagnosis of misophonia, she is now rebuilding her life and launching a career as a model.

Jo Collins, who works in a bar, is frightened of the music of Elvis Presley, which causes problems when well-meaning punters put him on the jukebox.

And mother Lindsay Broom is worried that her daughter will become a lover of the Muppets, as she has a phobia of all puppets and refuses to have them in the house.
