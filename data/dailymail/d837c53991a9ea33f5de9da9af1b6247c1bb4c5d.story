Mysterious death: Researchers identified a new tick-borne illness called the Bourbon Virus believed to be the cause of John Seested, 68, this summer

Researchers have identified a new tick-borne illness believed to be the cause of a Kansas man's death this summer.

The Centers for Disease Control are investigating a new disease being named the Bourbon Virus that doctors struggled to identify for months.

WPTV reports that a patient entered the University of Kansas Medical Center with symptoms like those of other diseases carried by ticks.

In spite of the symptoms, John Seested, 68, tested negative for known tick-borne illnesses, according to the Fort Scott Tribune.

'It was very frustrating,' Dr Dana Hawkinson, an infectious disease physician at the hospital told WPTV about the uncertainty surrounding the diagnosis.

'That's one of the biggest problems with my job, which I love, when we can't answer those questions, when we can't help the patients or their families.'

The man did not respond to treatment, according to Dr Hawkinson, and soon went into multiple organ failure and died.

Seested's death certificate listed three causes of death, with tick-borne illness as the third, Seested's wife, Jan, told the Tribune.

An obituary for Seested stated he was a member of the Stanley Buccaneers 4-H Club and president of the Junior Hereford Association, and noted he had a passion for raising show calves.

Six months passed before researchers from the CDC and the University of Kansas discovered that Bourbon Virus, named after the county where Seested lived, was to blame for his death.

Diseases: Though he was bitten by a tick and experienced symptoms similar to other tick-borne diseases, tests of John Seested came back negative

There is still no vaccine for this newly discovered illness, though researchers say they're pressing ahead to look at how to fight the disease.

'This may be a cause of other people's illness as well and those will be steps we're going to be looking at with the CDC too,' Hawkinson said.
