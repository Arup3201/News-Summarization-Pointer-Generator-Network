A police officer sent a picture of his penis to a person he believed was a 15-year-old girl, a court heard yesterday.

PC Anthony Fellows, 26, denies sending the sexually explicit photograph.

The officer, who has been a PC for four years, was arrested last month and suspended from duty by West Midlands Police.

PC Anthony Fellows arrives at Birmingham Magistrates Court where he is accused of sending an obscene picture

He appeared at Birmingham Magistrates Court charged with 'attempting to cause a child aged 13 to 15 to watch or look at an image of sexual activity' under the Criminal Attempts Act 1981.

The offence allegedly took place between October 19 and November 11 last year.

The prosecutor said: 'The girl in question has not been able to be traced, and the person who reported the crime has no details for the girl.

'It appears that the girl in question didn't actually exist, so Mr Fellows didn't expose any youngster to inappropriate content.'

Fellows, from Rugeley, Staffordshire, spoke only to confirm his name and address during the 10 minute hearing.

He was bailed and ordered to return to Birmingham Crown Court on June 14.
