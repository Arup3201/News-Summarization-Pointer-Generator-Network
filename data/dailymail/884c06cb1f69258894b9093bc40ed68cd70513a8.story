Demcoratic Senate Majority Leader 
Harry Reid made waves on Thursday by predicting that his GOP 
counterpart, House Speaker John Boehner, will ultimately 'cave in' and 
green-light a comprehensive immigration reform bill.

But
 Republicans' frustrations ignore the fact that most U.S. Hispanics 
prefer their approach to the thorny subject over the Democrats' central 
idea.

Reid, a Nevadan, told the Las Vegas Sun that Boehner is 'going to cave in' eventually because of outside pressure from Hispanic activists.

'I think there’s going to be so much pressure on the House that they’ll have to pass it,' he said.

'If
 the Republicans ever want to elect a Republican president again, 
they’re going to have to get right with the Hispanic and Asian community
 who, by more than 70 percent, voted for Obama last time.'

Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, claimed House Republicans 'will cave in' and embrace his party's approach to an amnesty for 11 million illegal immigrants

President Barack Obama met on Nov. 29 with immigration reform activists who are fasting in protest. The president's coattails on the issue have shrunk, with 60 per cent of Americans now disapproving of how he handles the immigration fight

The questions: How will Hispanics like these men in a Los Angeles County Latino district vote, and will a GOP walk-back on immigration change their minds?

The Reid-led Senate 
passed a bill in June that includes most of President Barack Obama's 
immigration wish list, most notably a pathway to citizenship for people 
who live in the United States illegally.

The
 effort has stalled in the House of Representatives, with 
Republican leaders insisting that America's 11 million illegal 
immigrants must not be given new legal protections until the U.S. border
 with Mexico is largely sealed.

Some
 Republican lawmakers have proposed a '90 per cent' test, agreeing that a
 pathway to legal status could be extended only after the U.S. is capable of 
blocking nine out of every ten people who try to make an illicit border crossing.

That approach seems to resonate with Hispanic voters.

Does it matter? In a Pew poll, only the national
 economy drove more dislike of Obama's policies than immigration, a 
political reality that could put Speaker John Boehner (L) in the 
driver's seat

In a June 2013 
poll, the most recent published survey on the subject, 60 per cent of 
registered Hispanic voters said they supported granting illegal 
immigrants a new status 'only when the 90% goal is reached.'

Just 34 per cent disagreed.

Not a big deal? In the 2012 Pew Hispanic Center poll, immigration placed nearly last among issues U.S. Hispanics said were 'extremely important' to them

The survey was
 conducted by the Latino Opinions organization and sponsored by Jordan 
Winery.

It asked respondents if they thought illegal immigrants should 
be permitted to collect benefits from the federal government, including 
health insurance subsidies, 'while they are going through the legalization process and before the 90% goal is reached.'

They opposed the idea by a 56-40 margin.

The
 poll also found that while Hispanics in general rank immigration reform
 among the issues that concern them most, those who are registered to 
vote consider it less important than the economy, education, or health 
care.

A June 2012 Gallup survey
 found much the same. Twenty per cent of Hispanics told Gallup's 
pollsters that immigration was their most important issue – tying it for
 the lead with two other issues – but Just 12 per cent of Hispanic 
registered voters said the same. That number put immigration near the 
bottom of the pack.

Those
 finding may give Republican hard-liners some solace. Centrists have 
argued that the GOP needs to embrace a liberal-leaning immigration 
stance in order to entice Hispanic voters away from Democrats' waiting 
arms.

'It puts us on a 
playing field where we can compete for the Hispanic voter,' Arizona Sen.
 John McCain told PBS host Gwen Ifill in July.

'If
 we don’t do that,' he said, 'frankly ... I see further 
polarization of the Hispanic voters and the demographics are clear that 
the Republican Party cannot win a national election. That’s just a 
fact.'

They speak Spanish, they vote, and they support Democrats: So what's the GOP to do? Some Republicans believe 'caving' on immigration will be the first step toward rapprochement with U.S. Hispanics

But a 2012 Pew Hispanic
 Center poll showed that few in that demographic group – only 34 per 
cent – said immigration policy is an 'extremely important issue.'

Fully
 55 per cent said education was extremely important to them, closely 
followed by 'jobs and the economy' with 54 per cent, health care with 50
 per cent, and the federal budget deficit with 36 per cent.

GOP's complication: Many immigration activists are organized by the Service Employees International Union or other labor groups, making an easy ideological bridge to the Democratic Party

Only the issue of tax reform, rated 
as extremely important by just 33 per cent of Hispanics, polled lower than 
immigration – and by just a single percentage point.

Still,
 the Pew survey found that a paltry 22 per cent of Hispanics self-identify 
as Republicans, a reality that some in the GOP believe they can turn 
around by conceding the immigration issue to Democrats.

Speaker Boehner's office announced Tuesday that it has hired Rebecca Tallent as his new point person on immigration policy.

Tallent
 caught flak from conservatives when she was Sen. McCain's chief adviser
 on the same issue. She played a role in drafting a failed comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2007.

More recent polls find Hispanic Americans splitting with President Obama in record numbers.

Gallup reported
 Thursday that Obama has lost 23 percentage point of support from that 
group since  the month after his 2012 re-election. Now 52 per cent of 
Hispanics approve of his job performance, down from 75 per cent a year 
ago.

And Pew found last 
month that 60 per cent of Americans disapprove of how the president is 
handling the immigration issue, a number that had never before broken the 50 
per cent threshold.

That policy mirrors the most conservative Republican approach that would take action to untangle America's immigration knot
