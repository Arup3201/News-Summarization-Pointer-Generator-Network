North Korean authorities say are holding a U.S. tourist after he apparently tried to claim asylum in the pariah state.

The 24-year-old was arrested for improper behaviour while he was bring processed to enter the Communist dictatorship as a tourist, state media reported.

The arrest was announced as Barack Obama issued a stark warning to North Korean despot Kim Jong-un of fresh economic sanctions over his nuclear ambitions.

The U.S. President said he would stand 'shoulder to shoulder' with South Korea in opposing the North's plans for a fourth nuclear test.

The American arrested by officials in North Korea was identified as Miller Matthew Todd - possibly putting his surname first.

The official North Korean Central News agency said he had entered the country on April 10 with a tourist visa, but then tore it up and shouted that he wanted to seek asylum there.

The brief report said he chose the North 'as a shelter'.

In Washington, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters that the U.S. is aware of the report, but she did not confirm an American was being held.

She said the department is in touch with the Swedish Embassy which handles consular cases for the U.S. because Washington does not have diplomatic relations with Pyongyang.

'There is no greater priority to us than the welfare and safety of U.S. citizens. We don't have additional information to share at this time,' Ms Psaki said.

A large number of foreign tourists were in North Korea in mid-April to see events held for the anniversary of national founder Kim Il Sung's April 15 birthday.

North Korea has been trying to boost tourism recently to generate income, but it also continues to be highly sensitive about the activities and conduct of foreigners who are allowed in.

It remains ostracised internationally for its insistence on developing nuclear weapons. As the country threatened new nuclear tests Obama said it may be time to consider further sanctions.

Testing times: He made the comments hours after North Korea made its feelings on his visit clear, sending two DPRK patrol boats into South Korean waters, violating the maritime border and forcing its neighbour to respond with a series of warning shots. Finally the vessels withdrew

But Obama acknowledged there are limits to what impacts additional penalties can have on the country.

'North Korea already is the most isolated country in the world by far,' Obama said. 'Its people suffer terribly because of the decisions its leaders have made. And we are not going to find a magic bullet that solves this problem overnight.'

It comes as North Korea
 warned last month it would not rule out a 'a new form' of nuclear test 
after the United Nations Security Council condemned Pyongyang for 
launching ballistic missiles into the sea.

Nuclear 
expert Jeffrey Lewis, of the Monterey Institute of International Studies
 in the United States, said this month that the reference to a new form 
of test could mean simultaneous detonation of two or more devices as 
part of a programme of more intense nuclear testing expected over the 
next few years.

Obama said the missile technology and nuclear weapons that North Korea is developing pose a direct threat to Korea and Japan, two very close U.S. allies in the region, but to the United States as well.Â

He said the missile technology and nuclear weapons that North Korea is developing pose a direct threat to Korea and Japan, two very close U.S. allies in the region, but to the United States as well

Great sorrow: Obama also noted that his visit comes at a time of 'great sorrow' for South Korea, which is mourning the loss of more than 300 people in a ferry that sank off the country's southwestern coast. The vast majority of the victims were high school students

'We can't waver in our intention. We have to make sure that, in strong concert with our allies, that we are continuing to press North Korea to change its approach,' Obama said, presenting a united front in the presence of Park.

The White House said it was keeping close tabs on activity at North Korea's nuclear test site, where commercial satellite imagery this week showed increased activity. Park said the assessment of her government is that North Korea is 'fully ready now' to conduct another nuclear test. 'This is a very tense situation,' she said.

'President Obama's visit to South Korea sends a strong message to North Korea that its provocative acts cannot be tolerated,' she said.

Obama also noted that his visit comes at a time of 'great sorrow' for South Korea, which is mourning the loss of more than 300 people in a ferry that sank off the country's southwestern coast. The vast majority of the victims were high school students.

'So many were young students with their entire lives ahead of them,' Obama said, invoking his two daughters, both close in age to many of the ferry victims. 'I can only imagine what the parents are going through at this point, the incredible heartache.'

He said he was donating a magnolia tree from the White House lawn to the high school in honor of the lives lost and a symbol of friendship between the U.S. and South Korea.

Egregious: Obama also said Japan's use of South Korean 'comfort women' during World War II was a terrible and egregious violation of human rights. Pictured: a group of Japanese protesters supporting former comfort women, or sex slaves, outside the Japanese parliament in Tokyo in 2005

Fresh from his visit to Japan, where he dined yesterday with Prime Minister Shinzo at Tokyo's finest sushi restaurant, Obama also said Japan's use of South Korean 'comfort women' during World War II was a terrible and egregious violation of human rights.

He said South Korean women were violated in ways that were shocking even in the midst of war. He added that those women deserve to be heard and respected and that there should be a clear account of what happened.

As he addressed historical tensions between U.S. allies Japan and South Korea, he said the Japanese people and their prime minister understand the past must be recognized honestly. But Obama is urging Japan and South Korea to move forward because he says their interests clearly converge.
