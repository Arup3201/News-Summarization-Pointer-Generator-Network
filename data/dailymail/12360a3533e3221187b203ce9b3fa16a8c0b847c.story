You need the courage of a lion to stick needles into a big cat like Lucifer – or an extremely effective anaesthetic.

Happily for vet Nicki Grint the dose given to the 30st animal worked perfectly while she used acupuncture on a sore foot where a tumour was removed.

She has used the method on dogs before but not cats.

Making a swift recovery: Lucifer is the first animal to have acupuncture at Paignton Zoo in Devon

And 11-year-old Lucifer is the first animal to have acupuncture at Paignton Zoo in Devon where he lives.

The needles stay in for 15 minutes and are being used with conventional therapy to relieve pain and improve blood flow to the wound to help it heal.

Veterinary Associate at Paignton Zoo Jo Reynard said: 'Lucifer had a tumour removed from his right hind foot but the place has not healed properly.

'We are using acupuncture to decrease pain and improve blood flow to the site, helping the healing process.

'We’re using gas anaesthesia and all the usual medical painkillers.

'The acupuncture is simply being used opportunistically, as an adjunct to conventional therapy in the hope that it might help the wound heal.'

The needles are inserted at 2.5cm intervals around the wound - the Chinese, where the alternative treatment was first used, call this ‘ringing the dragon’.

The procedure requires the animal to stay still, so they need to be under a general anaesthetic and it is only done when absolutely necessary.

Acupuncture uses thin needles to treat a range of conditions, most commonly pain relief.

A form of complementary medicine and a key component of traditional Chinese medicine, it is thought to have developed thousands of years ago.

The zoo said the signs are that Lucifer will make a swift recovery.
