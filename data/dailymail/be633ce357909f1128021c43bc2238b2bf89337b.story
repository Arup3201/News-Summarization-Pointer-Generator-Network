Stewart Downing thought occasions like this had passed him by and you might say it passed him by again. First start for two-and-a-half years and then hooked after 45 minutes. Every silver lining comes with its own cloud.

It just goes to emphasise how fleeting chances can be in international sport and how vital it is to grasp your opportunity when it comes and make the most of it.

Take a bow Nathaniel Clyne, who has proved precisely how it can be done. Only four days into his England career and Clyne, who extinguished the threat of winger Ikechi Anya on Tuesday night, looks like he will take some moving from the right back spot.

Stewart Downing made his first start for England in two-and-a-half years and was hooked after 45 minutes

Across the back four on the left, Luke Shaw offered a reminder of his talent and a warning to Leighton Baines and Kieran Gibbs, who replaced him after an hour.

Shaw is strong and quick and more composed on the ball in the heat of Celtic Park than a teenager has any right to be. He will surely improve as a defender as he matures, just as Jack Wilshere has rapidly developed as a deep-lying playmaker, because he has the necessary tools and a good football brain.

Wilshere has been outstanding in the last four England games, dictating tempo, organising those around him, passing the ball, biting in the tackle and controlling his instinct to dribble the dangerous areas.

He also produced the pass of the match for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to score the opener. It was an England goal made in Arsenal, with a little help from Southampton. Eight of Roy Hodgson’s 22-man squad have strong connections to Saints.

But where the Ox flourished, with a reminder of his energy and his goal threat, Downing’s chance came and went. He did nothing wrong. He held his shape on the left of a tight midfield trio, with Wilshere and James Milner, and patrolled the areas he was expected to.

But the ability to produce something special under intense scrutiny is what international football is about, especially if your role carries creative responsibilities.

Adam Lallana came on and immediately the team played with a happier rhythm, with more balance. Downing is entitled to counter that the hardest part of Tuesday night’s game was the opening half-hour, where England had to be disciplined.

He played his part in helping England take the lead and take a grip. They were two up within minutes of Lallana coming on, and he was able to play with more freedom. He may not have Downing’s determination to track back to the edges of his own penalty box simply to deny the opponents space, but Scotland were a wilting force by then.

Spaces were starting to open up and Lallana’s fluency does not help Downing’s chances of adding to his 35 caps. At the age of 30, will he be back? Who knows who will be fit and in form by the time these players meet again for international duty in March.

Downing did nothing wrong but lacked the creativity to produce something special when it matters

Downing’s confidence has been built at West Ham. The test is to return to Upton Park and impress again. According to Opta’s statistics, he has created 34 chances, more than any other English player in the Premier League this season.

Modern coaches love to have tactical flexibility at their disposal and his ability to play in different roles is an advantage. It has helped him into tournament squads in the past, but it will only help again if his form holds.

Too often in this match his touch let him down. It might have been nerves playing their part. He found it hard to get on the ball as Scotland disrupted England during an opening passage of play which was still reverberating from an extraordinary pre-match atmosphere featuring flames and bagpipes (together at last, although perhaps not in a way the English were hoping).

Amid the din, Downing’s first touch was inconsistent. Poor control encouraged Shaun Maloney to snap into an early tackle which had England’s No 8 hopping around in pain. Having aggravated an injury during the warm-up at Wembley on Saturday, he did not want another setback. Perhaps this was a factor in his subdued performance.

Others were able to thrive in the atmosphere and Hodgson will be delighted with the work-rate and willingness to match Scotland’s aggression and desire.

Fraser Forster, another enjoying the rare treat of an international start, might have liked more activity to prove what he can do but it is a fine line for a goalkeeper . Forster was alert to save from Russell Martin, when he needed to be, but could not protect his clean sheet.

As for Downing, he will hope there is another chance to come next year. If there isn’t, this was a night for all England players to savour: an England win in Glasgow.
