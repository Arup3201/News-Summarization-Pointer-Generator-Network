An on-the-run Polish killer questioned over a ‘new Baby P’ case was part of a burglary gang that cut a man’s throat for his TV.

The 30-year-old woman and two accomplices left the man for dead after making off with the set and his jacket worth just £179.

Yet after absconding from her 12 year sentence for the appalling crime, she was able to freely enter the UK and move into a taxpayer-subsidised home.

The 30-year-old mother  (pictured with her son) was jailed for 12 years in her home country after leaving a man for dead after making off with the TV and his jacket worth just £179

Now the woman and her boyfriend are at the centre of a Scotland Yard murder investigation after their six-month-old son died from serious head injuries.

Social services face serious questions over what steps they took to safeguard the youngster after discovering she was a wanted killer.

Her local council, Haringey, is poised to launch a serious case review to discover what went wrong in the weeks before his death.

The woman has appeared before an extradition court 14 times since she was arrested in Tottenham in January last year.

Her brother revealed she may have been in the country for two years before she was finally tracked down by the police.

The Daily Mail can now reveal full details of the horrific crime for which the Polish authorities want her extradited to serve the rest of her sentence.

In December 2002, when she was just 18, she was part of a gang who robbed a man called Janusz Marosz in her hometown of Leczyca, in central Poland.

According to court documents, he was beaten and struck with a ‘dangerous implement’ and struck ‘at least twice in the area of the jugular vein’.

The trio then ‘bludgeoned him with other blunt instruments causing damage to his main arteries and as a consequence, death.’

They then stole a TV set and his jacket from his apartment. The possessions had a total value of about 1,000 zloty, or £179.

The woman and her boyfriend, aged 26, are due to answer bail later this month as inquiries continue into what happened in the days before he son was found fatally wounded.

One source close to the inquiry said ‘this can only get worse’ amid fears opportunities were missed to save his life.

Her son, known only as Baby O, was rushed to hospital from his home in Haringey, North London, last month after his parents dialled 999.

Paramedics raced him to North Middlesex Hospital and he was transferred to Great Ormond Street Hospital where he died three days later.

A post-mortem examination found he died from a head injury. The parents have been arrested on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm.

The woman’s brother, a 26-year-old employee of a medical supplies manufacturer, said her family have been told the little boy died in an accident.

The woman's son, known as Baby O, died in Great Ormond Street Hospital after suffering head injuries 

Speaking in Leczyca, a small industrial town two hours west of Warsaw, he said the woman emigrated to the UK ‘two or three years ago’.

‘She is devastated. What happened was a terrible accident as far as we know,’ he added.

‘[She] always spoke to me about her children in a loving way. I’ve never met her boyfriend but I have no reason to think anything bad of him.

‘She never gave me any sign that they were having problems.

‘We had a tough life growing up. We were definitely poor, we were four brothers and three sisters and Dad wasn’t around. Our mother just died in April.

‘When she was 18, she got in with the wrong people, small time crooks who were into heavy drinking and drugs.

‘She got a sentence for murder because she was with two of these guys when they were robbing a man in his home and beat him up so badly that he died.

‘The law came down very hard on her because she was an accomplice and had been hanging around with these people.’

Haringey Council endured a storm of criticism after the death of 17-month-old Peter Connelly, known as Baby P, in August 2007.

A spokeswoman said the Local Safeguarding Children Board is preparing to commission a review into the role of all agencies that were involved with the family.
