Raise a glass and say cheers to pubs - for according to scientists the local is worth up to £120,000-a-year to its community, it was revealed yesterday.

An 18-month academic study into Britain's rural pubs found they offer economic, social and other benefits to communities that would probably not be replaced if they were to close.

Some of that is social, like providing a place to meet for local people, many of them old or single who may not mix with their neighbours if it wasn't for a friendly inn nearby.

But also it is economic, said Dr Ignazio Cabra of Northumbria University's Newcastle Business School who was given a £7,700 grant to go round community pubs across the UK.

He found the value of a pub to a rural community was equal to between £80,000 and £120,000.

This includes business connections, such as sourcing local produce for food and drink, to giving work to locals, holding events and bringing communities together.

It also, in many areas, includes the pub becoming the replacement for the post office, village shop and other services that have been closed down nearby, he said.

The research is good news for an industry struggling against sky high tax on alcohol and supermarket price wars which has seen many replace a night at the pub with drinking at home.

But Dr Cabra said: "Pubs are not just businesses they are assets.

"In many villages there is no shop, no post office, no local traders but there is still a pub and that pub embodies all that those those services provided to the community.

"If you lose a pub, you lose much more than a building and once that pub is gone it will never come back."

The study was conducted in partnership with the Leeds University Business School and examined rural pubs in 2,800 parishes with a population of less than 3,000 and situated at least five miles from the nearest town.

Pro-pub campaigners hope the report can be used to influence government policy around planning applications regarding pubs, where many are being turned into other uses.

John Longden of campaign group Pub is the Hub said: "In rural areas, pubs act as essential melting pots for bringing the community together from all walks of life.

"This study concludes that is a yet another vital service that the countryside cannot afford to lose."
