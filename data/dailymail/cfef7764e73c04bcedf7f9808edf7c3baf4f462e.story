This is the heartwarming video when Ellen DeGeneres sent 'Apparently' boy Noah Ritter to go walking with dinosaurs.

The five-year-old from Pottstown, Pennsylvania became an internet sensation after appearing on a live TV interview in August following the Wayne County Fair in Pennsylvania. 

He was invited on the Ellen DeGeneres show where he proved such a hit, producers decided to send him on a VIP trip to Walking With Dinosaurs.

Little Noah Ritter warns paleontologist Thomas Huxley 'not move a muscle' when the T-Rex approached

When face to face with the T-Rex, Noah covers his ears as the giant dinosaur roars 

Noah met with a paleontologist Thomas Huxley before being introduced to three animatronic dinosaurs. 

Mr Huxley asked Noah to close his eyes as the first dinosaur approached. The youngster jumped as the robot animal let out a roar. 

Noah said: 'That's a Stegosaurus.' 

The five-year-old was able to explain that the Stegosaurus was heavily armoured with protective plates on his back and wouldn't die 'without a fight'. 

Next up was the Triceratops. When asked whether the beast was a predator or a herbivore, Noah replied: 'He's a plant eater. I've seen a lot of dinosaur movies in my day.' 

Mr Huxley asked Noah to close in on the animal when it sneezed. 

'He just sneezed on me,' cried Noah as he ran of to safety. 

Finally, when the T-Rex approached, Noah advised: 'Do not move a muscle. That's a T-Rex. He would tear my arm off in a second.' 

At the end of his visit, Noah had an endearing message to the television host: 'Thank you Ellen for sending me. I had a great time, even though i got sneezed on by a Triceratops. It wasn't real boogers. It was just water.'

He later returned to the studio where he gave host Ellen DeGeneres a full lowdown on his escapade 

Noah became an internet sensation after an unprompted interview in which he endearingly used the word 'apparently' eight times - without even knowing what it meant. 

But the big news of the night was when he told the crowd that 'he got over' the word 'apparently'- whether he ever learned what it meant or how it is spelt is uncertain.

When asked what his new preferred word was, he jubilantly proclaimed 'seriously' before launching into an arm-waving celebration.

After achieving world-fame with his hilarious first interview with WNEP TV at the Wayne County Fair in Honesdale, Pennsylvania - Noah may struggle to reach such heights again with his new word.

Noah Ritter became an internet sensation after an interview with WNEP TV last month.

A newscaster is seen approaching him on the opening day of the Wayne County Fair in Honesdale, Pennsylvania.

While reporter Sofia Ojeda was seeking a verdict on the ride he had just been on with his grandfather, Noah had his own agenda.

Exhibiting a fondness for the word 'apparently', he said: 'It was great and apparently I’ve never been on live television but apparently sometimes I don’t watch the news because I’m a kid and apparently every time Grandpa just gives me the remote I have to watch the Powerball.'

The preschooler was clearly excited to share his views, confidently holding the microphone and speaking in a somewhat newscaster-y voice.

Still attempting to get her soundbite, Ms Ojeda asked again how Noah had enjoyed his ride, only to get more of his adorable perspective on life. 

'Well, it was great because apparently you’re spinning around and apparently every time you get dizzy, that’s all you do is get dizzy,' he said. 'I’ve never ever been on live television. I've never been on live television.'

The amused reporter, who is seen crouching down to speak at his level, asks: 'Are you excited?'

To which Noah replies: 'Yeah, and apparently I only went down the super slide. . . I was scared half to death. I just freak out.'

Noah used the word 'apparently' no less than eight times during the one-and-a-half-minute interview, and repeated that he had never been on live television three times.

Noah's grandfather, Jack Borowski, who had accompanied him to the fair, told ABC News: 'Noah is pretty talkative. He has a large vocabulary.'
