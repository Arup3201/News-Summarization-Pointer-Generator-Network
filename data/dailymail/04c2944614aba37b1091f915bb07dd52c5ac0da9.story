A Labour MP's researcher has been accused of hypocrisy after a picture emerged of her giving a Hitler salute hours after she slammed a Tory MP for attending a party where guests chanted Nazi slogans.

Charlotte Hale, who works for MP Emma Reynolds, said that Conservative Aidan Burley was 'disgraceful' for attending the stag do where he sat next to the stag who was wearing a Nazi SS uniform.

However, her jibe on Twitter castigating the Tory now appears to be rather premature as a picture emerged of her next to a waxwork model of Adolf Hitler with her right arm thrust in the air.

The picture of the 21-year-old Wolverhampton University war studies and politics student, taken at Madame Tussauds,  was leaked to the Guido Fawkes political blog.

After Mr Burley was exposed, had written on Twitter: 'Story about the Cannock Chase TORY MP is disgraceful. He should step down.'

She has worked for Ms Reynolds, the Wolverhampton East MP, as a constituency assistant since September last year. Ms Reynolds was first elected as an MP at the general election.

The picture was apparently taken in April 2009.

She stood unsuccessfully as a Labour candidate in South Staffordshire District Council local elections this year and is chair of the Wolverhampton University Labour Students society.

Conservative Aidan Burley was forced to apologise in a bid to save his career after attending a party with 12 Oxford-educated some of whom chanted ‘Hitler, Hitler, Hitler’, 
at a restaurant in a French ski resort.

Labour called for David Cameron to sack Mr Burley, a senior aide to Transport Secretary Justine Greening, for bringing ‘shame on the country’.

Mr
Burley, the MP for Cannock Chase in Staffordshire, was filmed by 
journalists from the Mail on Sunday raising his glass before a fellow 
guest made a speech saying: ‘Let’s raise a toast to Tom for organising 
the stag do, and if we’re perfectly honest, to the ideology and thought 
process of the Third Reich.’

The MP did not raise his glass during the speech. He did appear to pay the bill for the meal, although he later said he had paid only his share.

Mr Burley said on Twitter: ‘Deeply regret inappropriate behaviour by some guests at stag party I attended and I am extremely sorry for any offence caused.’

Members of the stag party may face prosecution in France, where it is a crime to wear Nazi uniform in public except in a film or play.

Mr Burley, 32, has known the Prime Minister for at least five years and the pair ‘high five’ when they meet, according to Mr Burley’s friends on the stag night, who joked the MP was ‘the candidate for Berlin East’.

The Nazi incident happened on December 3 in Restaurant La Fondue, an upmarket venue in the centre of the ski resort of Val Thorens.

The MP, elected in 2010, sipped wine as one of the group taunted a waiter for being French.

Neither the Labour Party nor Emma Reynolds' office had responded to a request for comment.
