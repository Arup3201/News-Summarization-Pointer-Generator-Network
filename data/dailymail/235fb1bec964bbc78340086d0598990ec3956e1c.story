A cash-strapped council has been slammed for spending thousands of pounds on a sculpture of a dead tree - despite facing £42million in cuts.

Knowsley Council is facing major criticism after commissioning the divisive tree, thought to have cost up to £60,000 - but has defended the artwork as 'absolutely spectacular'.

The six-metre iron sculpture, called 'The Tree of Life', was put up in Kirkby town centre in Merseyside after supermarket giant Tesco pulled out of plans for a new store in the area.

The  statue is part of a £320,000 project to spruce up the town centre, partly paid for by Tesco - whose new supermarket would have created 800 jobs.

Knowsley Council represents one of the most deprived areas in the country and is facing budgets cuts of up to 30 per cent or £42million this year.

The structure, which is without leaves or full branches, has left many residents frustrated, especially as major cuts announced last year were predicted to cost as many as 300 jobs.

Knowsley Council has called the piece 'absolutely spectacular', but many have taken to social media site Facebook to call it a 'monstrosity'. 

Deborah McLean said: 'Speechless, words fail me.'

Kirk Phillips wrote: 'Have a guess who is paying for that plazzy tree.....that's where your council tax is going.'

And Billy Elliott added: 'What a monstrosity. How can they call it the tree of life when it looks dead? Not a leaf in sight.'

But Geoff Wood, the artist behind the tree, is hoping it will grow on people.

He said: 'This tree was based on the oldest tree in the borough but it was a very sick tree. It was falling down, it was dangerous so it had to be felled anyway, so I suggested we should cast it in iron and give it a new life.

'The tree was over 400 years old so, with it, it carries all the memories of all the people who have lived during that time.'

He says it is not yet finished and is one of three art pieces. Others called 'Three thrones' and 'Edward's Elephant' are set to follow.

Nine tonnes of molten iron went into making the tree. A golden disc, which will catch the sunlight and provide some shelter from the rain, will complete the design.

Mocking: Many people have taken to Twitter to ridicule the new sculpture, thought to have cost up to £60,000

A spokesperson for Knowsley Council said: 'The tree is absolutely spectacular and will be a real focal point in the new-look town centre.

'The idea for the tree came from discussions with local people who wanted a piece of art to illustrate strength and roots in the local community and a place they could meet up with friends in the town centre.'

'The idea for the tree came from discussions with local people who wanted a piece of art to illustrate strength and roots in the local community and a place they could meet up with friends in the town centre.

'We have engaged with local schools and community groups throughout the process and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Local people have really played their part in creating this piece of art and we are sure they will love it for years to come.

'The overall cost of the three new pieces of public art in Kirkby town centre is £320,000. This is made up of significant contributions from Tesco and arts funding grants, along with council funding, so this money could only have been used for public art and not for any other purpose.'
