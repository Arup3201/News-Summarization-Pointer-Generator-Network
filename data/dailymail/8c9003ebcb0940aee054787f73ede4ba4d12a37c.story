The father of a severely ill newborn baby has launched a desperate appeal to save his son's life and bring him home from China for treatment.

When tiny Constantine Martland was born on May 5 his parents Michael, 30 and Cath were told their son had the rare heart condition, Hypoplastic Right Heart Syndrome.

The illness means only the left side of Constantine's heart can function and he will require a three-step operation to survive.

Mr Martland, who moved to Beijing in 2007 to work as a teacher, said immediately after his son was born he was taken away from the couple as Chinese policy dictated he needed to be cared for in isolation.

Tiny Constantine Martland was born in China on May 5. Within hours of his birth his parents Michael and Cath were told he had the rare condition Hypoplastic Right Heart Syndrome

On the second day of his short life, Mr and Mrs Martland were told their baby son had just 24 hours to live, because the Chinese hospital did not have the resources necessary to care for Constantine.

The distraught couple discharged their son and upgraded him to the Western-style Anzhen Hospital, with the help of Mr Martland's friend and boss Daphne Hutagalung.

There doctors said Constantine could survive but he faces very risky surgery when he is a month old.

The procedure, to implant a BT shunt, aims to restart the left side of Constantine's heart.

If successful, the tiny baby could be deemed well enough to fly back to the UK for his second operation.

But the couple have used up their life savings on hospital fees in China, and are now launching a desperate appeal to raise money to continue funding Constantine's treatment.

'We still need to raise more so Constantine can have the first operation so he can return safely to the UK for the second and third step operations,' said Mr Martland.

'For the first few months, Constantine will be isolated as he cannot risk to be infected, therefore we will not be able to see him for that length of time.

'During the first few days of understanding our child’s condition, my wife and I were going through a range of emotions.

'I wrote a log to vent feelings and also to keep a record of everything that we’d experience so far for future reference.'

Constantine is currently in a stable condition, with doctors predicting he has a good chance of surviving the risky first procedure.

His parents have launched a desperate bid to raise money to pay for his first operation and after care in China and to fund bringing him back to the UK where he will need another two operations

Mr Martland, who is originally from Wigan, Greater Manchester, added: 'With Constantine stable enough we contacted Helen Walker from the Alder Hey hospital who was extremely understanding with our situation.

'We had an idea to fly Constantine from 
Beijing to Liverpool using the SOS International Group but as it turns 
out that because of the severity of his condition and lack of prior 
insurance we could not afford to fly him out with the medical 
assistance.

Hypoplastic Right Heart Syndrome is a very rare condition which causes the right side of the heart to be underdeveloped at birth.

It results in the chambers, valves and blood vessels of the right side of the heart being malformed.

These malformations include a very small right ventricle and a small pulmonary artery.

The malformation means the heart is not able to pump blood efficiently to the lungs causing low blood oxygen levels.

Symptoms of the condition normally develop almost immediately after a baby is born.

Affected babies often take on a bluish tint - particularly to their skin, lips and fingernails.

Treatment options include open-heart surgery and a heart transplant.

'So at least the first operation must be performed here in Beijing, and it’s usually common for a child to be in the hospital for four months average before they are discharged.

'Our life savings, which were meant to be used for a return to the UK, have been spent in a matter of days.

'That is why we are asking for help and donations for Constantine and other children who need similar help when insurers find it difficult to provide for them.

'We would like the readers to be aware all extra money that is donated after we reach our goal will be re-donated to other children heart foundations in the UK and China so they can also provide care that is needed during a heart wrenching time.'

A target of £15,000 has been set and a third of that has been raised so far.

Mr Martland added: 'It is difficult for us but at the same time, we find this a painful yet small price to pay for a chance at life for our boy.

'Constantine would not be where he is without the help of people like Daphne, the team at Jia De Montessori Kindergarten (JDM) and the parents who helped us with donations, Dr Jayne Ziermann and all the staff at Oasis Hospital, Dr Helen Walker and Alder Hey and Dr Chen at Anzhen hospital.'
