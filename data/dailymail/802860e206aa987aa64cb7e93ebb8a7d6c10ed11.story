A man's threatening tirade on board a Sydney-bound Virgin flight which forced the plane to turn back to Perth has cost him almost $60,000.

But the embarrassing debacle on July 9 doesn't seem to have bothered Brenden James Tume too much as he has posted a TV news report about his antics as the cover photo on his Facebook profile like a badge of honour. 

The 23-year-old father of two appeared in Perth Magistrates Court on Thursday, pleading guilty to two offences related to his aggressive outburst, while under the influence of alcohol and cannabis, which has cost him $48,500 in reparations for the distressing disruption and a $10,000 fine.

The plane left Perth at 5pm on July 9 but returned two hours later when Tume woke up during the flight and became abusive towards crew members.

'Stop talking s*** about me,' he repeatedly said to the flight staff.

'You have got my f***ing wallet.'

The court heard Tume shook his fists and threw magazines around with children seated nearby.

He then went on to threaten staff saying: 'I will get you. I will cause a stir and bring this plane down.'

The court heard Virgin suffered a significant financial loss for fuel and to accommodate passengers for the night because a curfew prevented it from arranging another plane.

The 23-year-old has to cough up almost $60,000 for his disruptive antics which forced the plane back to Perth

Tume, a father-of-two with a third child on the way, was disorientated when he woke up during the flight, the court heard.

His lawyer submitted that there was no forethought in his actions and the incident was not an accurate reflection of his character.

Chief Magistrate Steven Heath said people expected to fly safely and Tume's selfish act had caused distress to many people.

'Your behaviour on this occasion under the influence of whatever was completely inappropriate and irrational,' he said.

Tume must pay reparation costs of $48,568.90 and was also ordered to pay court costs of $94.30.
