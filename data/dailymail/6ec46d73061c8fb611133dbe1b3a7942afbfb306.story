It was an embarrassing arrest that threatened to bring down George W. Bush's presidential campaign in 2000.

The revelation that he had been caught drunk driving in 1976 was reported just days before Americans went to the ballot box - but it didn't stop him winning two terms in the White House.

Now Australian tennis legend John Newcombe, who was with the the former president on the night he was pulled over, has revealed what really happened, and how the politician was a bit of a 'party boy' back then.

The former Wimbledon champion described how Bush, then 30, took him to a local pub near their enormous family estate in Kennebunkport, Maine, where he was staying as a guest of  'close friend' and tennis fan George H. W. Bush, who was then director of the CIA.

Claims: Former tennis player John Newcombe (left) says 'party boy' George Bush was trying to keep up with him at a pub near the politician's holiday home in Kennebunkport, Maine, on the night he was arrested for DUI

The sportsman, who was inducted into the Australian Hall of Fame on Friday evening, had not met the younger Bush, but as they were similar ages they decided to go out with Bush's younger sister and his father's press sectary Peter Roussol.

During the evening Bush tried to 'keep pace' with Newcombe, then 32, while drinking 'reasonably-sized' mugs of beer and played a 'silent game' with him. 

Newcombe told Melborne radio station SEN: 'After about four of these, I picked the glass up in my teeth without my hands and skulled it straight down and I said, "What are you made of, George?" And so he had to do that.' 

As they staggered back to the car, Newcombe's wife Angie offered to drive but Bush insisted he was fine.

'We had about three miles to drive down this road along the sea and after about a mile he got pulled over,' Newcombe said.

'The cop got out of the car and made him walk the line and back and he kind of did it alright but he was a bit cheeky when he was doing it.' 

Younger: Newcombe (pictured left winning Wimbledon) in 1971 and Bush (pictured right in 1970) were staying together when the former US President was pulled over as they made their way back home in 1976

Estate: They had only three miles to drive back from the enormous summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine (pictured), but they were pulled over after two. The officer then made him walk a straight line 

As the officer was writing Roussol came out of the car and told him he was the son of the current director of the CIA.

The cop, whose name was Calvin, then said: 'Oh my God, I've just booked the son of the director of the CIA, I'm in real trouble.' 

Bush had managed to keep his crime a secret for 25 years before it was reported on networks around the country just days before Americans went to the polls.

He was fined US$150 dollars over the offence and gave up drinking in the 1980s.

The politician has subsequently apologized for his drinking: 'I'm not proud of that. I oftentimes said that years ago I made some mistakes. I occasionally drank too much and I did on that night.' 

Father and son: The tennis player was a guest of George H. W. Bush (right), who was director of the CIA at the time (pictured making his son a 2nd lieutenant with the Texas Air National Guard in 1968) 

Events: The seven-time grand slam winning player described how his wife, Angie, offered to drive as they walked back to the car, but Bush insisted he was fine
