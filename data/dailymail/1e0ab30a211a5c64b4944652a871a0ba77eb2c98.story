Should you be so inclined as to walk up to a random man in a fast-food joint, late at night, after consuming alcohol and grab him by the hand before slapping him across the face with a slice of pizza, do not be shocked when he hits you back.

This is what happened to a young man from Ontario, Canada, who wanted to play what he saw as an innocent prank on a man that had been annoying a friend of his after a night out.

Al Sutcliffe was filmed playing a ‘pizza slap’ prank on a man in a fast-food queue, but ended up being on the receiving end himself.

Mr Sutcliffe claims the man in the blue cap had been 'f***ing' with his friend, so decided to play a 'prank'

After grabbing hold of his hand in greeting, Mr Sutcliffe holds on and slaps the man across the face with a pizza

A short while later, the unsurprisingly furious victim comes back and knocks Mr Sutcliffe unconscious

The short clip, believed to have been recorded in Kitchener, Ontario, sees Mr Sutcliffe walk up to another young man, offering his hand to greet him.

However, Mr Sutcliffe has other motives, and instead of shaking the young man’s hand, he slaps him across the face with a slice of pizza.

On his YouTube page, Mr Sutcliffe describes the idea behind walking up to a stranger and slapping them across the face with a cheese pie as: ‘Buddy was f***ing with my buddy so I decided to pizza slap him!’

The stunned ‘pizza slap’-victim shouts abuse back in disbelief at what just happened, while Mr Sutcliffe laughs him off.

Aftermath: Moments after Mr SUtcliffe has 'pizza slapped' the young man in the queue, the 'victim' comes from behind, punching him in the head so he hits the table

Recovery: A few minutes later, Mr Sutcliffe is helped by witnesses, in particular a young lady seen on camera

Warning: Mr Sutcliffe's video, which has more than 260,000 views at the time of writing, posted that ' slapping people across the face with a slice of pizza could potentially get you sucker punched from behind'

It does not take long before the slapper becomes the slappee when the angry victim knocks Mr Sutcliffe out cold on the table.

According to the video, which has now gone viral, Mr Sutcliffe was unconscious for two minutes before being helped by other diners in the shop.

 ‘WARNING: Slapping people across the face with a slice of pizza could potentially get you sucker punched from behind,’ Mr Sutcliffe writes in a ‘disclaimer’ on his page.

‘You've been warned...’

Mr Sutcliffe’s clip has had more than 260,000 views since it was uploaded on Sunday.
