Cindy Crawford’s children have proved themselves a chip off the old block by collaborating on a stunning photo shoot featuring a series of images of Cindy’s 13-year-old daughter Kaia, which were taken by her 15-year-old son Presley.

In the photos, which were shared on the family’s Instagram account @kyyp, Kaia can be seen modeling a number of her mother’s most recognizable outfits, including a colorful Roberto Cavalli number first worn by Cindy at the Conde Nast Traveler Readers' Choice Awards in New York City in 2003. 

In another, which Ms Crawford shared with the caption 'Love seeing my my kids work together for @kbyp #proudmama,' Kaia wears a flowing fuchsia frock by Calypso St. Barth that her mom wore in a recent commercial for her signature furniture line.

It is not the first time that Kaia and her 15-year-old brother have worked together on a shoot. The pair first started posting pictures to the Instagram account back in June, when they shared a series of ethereal shots of Kaia wearing a flowing white dress and lying outside under a tree. 

The Instagram account, in which Kaia plays muse for her older brother, now has 11 images that look as though they were taken professionally.

Most of the comments on the photos note Kaia's good looks, resemblance to her mother and potential for a modeling career.

'You are really pretty! You have a great FUTURE! Good luck!,' one user writes, while another says 'Somebody stick her on a runway! Wow!'

In 2012, Kaia was chosen to star in a campaign for Young Versace. The brand said in a statement: 'Like her mother, Kaia has a very special gift. The camera really, really loves her.'

But just a few months later, Ms Crawford, 48, announced that she was putting her daughter's modeling career on hold until she got a little older, telling the Daily Front Row: 'There aren’t even a handful of jobs for a 10-year-old girl. But if she’s 17 and wants to try it… of course, what can I say?'

Ms Crawford launched her own modeling career at the age of 16, appearing on hundreds of magazine covers including Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, Elle, Cosmopolitan and Allure.

Her 52-year-old husband Rande Gerber, whom she has been married to since 1998, also pursued modeling before launching his own nightlife companies, Midnight Oil and the Gerber Group.

Presley, who has a beauty mark on the right side of his mouth similar to his mom's trademark mole, also earned praise for his photography skills.

'U r a great photographer!!,' wrote one Instagram user. 'Sharp angle, keep up with ur great works.'
