Didier Drogba is poised to take a step closer to realising his dream of a return to Chelsea this week.

Talks have been ongoing over a one year player-coach contract which will see the 36-year-old Stamford Bridge idol reunited with mentor Jose Mourinho.

Drogba is understood to have already texted some of his former Chelsea teammates to hint at his return.

Chelsea have wanted to lower the age of their playing squad but recognise the significant contribution Drogba can still make to the club on and off the pitch.

His experience and winning mentality can influence those around him while he has the ability to make an impact from the bench as he provides cover for main striker Diego Costa.

Chelsea have spent well this summer and will continue to add but have lost Samuel Eto'o and Demba Ba while Romelu lukaku could yet join Everton despite initially being recalled into the fold.

A player-coach contract though would also fall more comfortably into Financial Fair Play guidelines as part of his wages would be absorbed into the coaches budget.

Drogba first signed for Chelsea ten years ago and left in 2012. To confirm his departure, Drogba told the club's official website: 'I wanted to put an end the speculation and confirm that I am leaving Chelsea. It has been a very difficult decision for me to make and I am very proud of what we have achieved.

But the time is right for a new challenge for me. As a team we have accomplished so much and have won every single trophy possible.'

He returned last season as an opponent in the Champions League with Galatasaray and was presented with a thank you gift of a silver boot on behalf of the club.

His return will be welcomed by supporters and will strengthen Mourinho's position within the club. Yet fans will still be demanding another, younger striker or that Chelsea keep Lukaku. Much will depend though if the Belgian is willing to play second fiddle to Costa and Everton are poised with an offer to give him the starting place he demands.

Meanwhile, Chelsea are sending new signing Mario Pasalic out on loan to Elche for the 2014/15 season.

The Croatia Under-21 midfielder spoke to 24sata about the move revealing: 'As I went to say goodbye to my manager Jose Mourinho, he told me that I'm on the best way to one day return to Chelsea.

'He also told me that I must do my best on loan in Spain because he will keep track of all my games. Director of sport Michael Emenalo also told me that he and Mourinho will come to see me in Spain. I like this option from Elche... I always dreamed that I would play in La Liga once.'
