A neglected puppy who gnawed off her leg in a fight for survival  is now on the road to recovery.

Five-month-old Elsa was taken into the Wisconsin Humane Society in Milwaukee on December 22 and given immediate treatment for the horrific wound.

The terrier's previous owner had apparently left her unsupervised for two days and during that time, she'd bitten through her rear left limb to set it free from tangled curtain cord.

In a spot of bother: Five-month-old Elsa was taken into the Wisconsin Humane Society in Milwaukee on December 22 after gnawing off her hind leg 

The terrier's previous owner had apparently left her home alone for two days and during that time, she'd bitten through her rear left limb to set it free from tangled curtain cord

Despite the injury, vets said Elsa was 'full of kisses' with her 'tail wagging away' when she arrived at their facility.

She was given pain medication and antibiotics to treat signs of infection.

Further amputation was needed to clean up the stump and Elsa went in for surgery the very next day.

Footage of the canine shows she is already adapting well to being on three legs and can run at a good pace. 

Angela Speed, a spokesperson for WHS, said that young amputees usually learn to function 'very well' and can keep up with their able-bodied counterparts with no problem.

On to a new home: Elsa is expected to make a full recovery and will go up for adoption this week

'We know from experience that a leg amputation doesn't necessarily affect a dog’s mobility,' Speed noted.

Elsa is expected to make a full recovery and barring any medical complications, she will go up for adoption this week.

Humane Society officials say Elsa’s story highlights the importance of not leaving young dogs alone.

A note on the non-profit's Facebook page reads: 'Please note that puppies can easily get into trouble. 

'Always supervise play time, and confine your puppy to a safe room or kennel when you need to leave the house.'
