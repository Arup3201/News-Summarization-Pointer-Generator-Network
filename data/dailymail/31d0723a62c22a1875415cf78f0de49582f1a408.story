Theresa May has asked the College of Policing to draw up new guidelines on dealing with crime suspects

Police were last night ordered to halt their march towards arresting and charging suspects in secret.

Theresa May intervened to ‘protect transparency in the criminal justice system’.

It follows revelations by the Mail that one force in three is refusing to name suspects even after they have been charged.

Mrs May fears that if a person’s identity is kept hidden ‘witnesses and other victims might not come forward’.

The Home Secretary is warning chief constables that there ‘should be no right to anonymity at charge apart from in extremely unusual circumstances’.

Where suspects have been arrested but not charged, she said, they could be named if it was in the ‘public interest’ – a broad definition that does not tie police hands.

Forces have been justifying the new policy by quoting the Leveson report on Press standards.Lord Justice Leveson said that, save in exceptional circumstances, ‘the names or identifying details or those who are arrested or suspected of a crime should not be released to the press or public’. 

But in a letter to police policy chiefs, Mrs May pointed out that while the comments had been included in Lord Leveson’s report, they did not form part of his ‘substantive recommendations’.

She added: ‘I would like police forces to be aware of this fact.’ 

In the wake of the Leveson report, senior police began drawing up their own national guidelines stating that suspects should not be named on arrest. Critics likened the policy to a totalitarian state where people can be swept off the streets without anyone being told.

One force said last week that it would no longer name suspects even after they had been charged with a criminal offence.

Warwickshire Police made the announcement in a footnote to a press release which revealed that one of its former officers had been charged with stealing more than £100,000.

Senior officers – who were later forced to scrap the policy – explicitly cited the Leveson inquiry to justify their actions.

A Daily Mail survey revealed that 14 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales are keeping secret the names of suspects, even after they have been charged.

Mrs May’s letter, seen by the Mail, was sent to Alex Marshall, the chief executive of the new College of Policing, which trains officers and draws up policy guidelines.

She has asked the college to write new rules on dealing with crime suspects. Previously, the Association of Chief Police Officers had taken the lead on this.

The Mail has campaigned for transparency in the justice system

The letter says: ‘I am writing because of my concern about the different approaches taken by police forces regarding the anonymity of suspects upon arrest and charge.

‘In particular, I am concerned that the refusal of some police forces to name suspects who have been charged undermines transparency in the criminal justice system and risks the possibility that witnesses and other victims might not come forward.

‘I strongly believe that there should be no right to anonymity at charge apart from in extremely unusual circumstances.

‘I believe that there should be a right to anonymity at arrest, but I know that there will be circumstances in which the public interest means that an arrested suspect should be named.‘I would like you to work on new guidance that makes this clear.’ 

The move follows the revelation that BBC sexual predator Stuart Hall might never have been brought to justice under the proposed secrecy regime.

Publicity surrounding his arrest in December led to more than a dozen other victims coming forward. If they had not added their complaints, the case might have collapsed for lack of evidence.

After his arrest, Hall, 83, declared his innocence and invoked Leveson to complain about ‘systematic leaks to the media’.

Liberty director Shami Chakrabarti – an adviser to the Leveson inquiry – said that although it was wrong for the police to brief against suspects, it was ‘equally chilling’ for officers to refuse to name someone they have detained or charged. She also condemned a ‘blanket policy of arresting people in secret’.

Former Metropolitan Police Commissioner Lord Blair said it was in the interests of justice for suspects to be named because the resulting publicity could help uncover vital evidence.

Kirsty Hughes, of Index on Censorship, said: ‘In certain cases, it may be appropriate to preserve anonymity but a “policy” of secrecy reverses the principle of open justice that we have in the UK.’

Earlier this week, the Mail revealed how police had concealed the arrest of Jimmy Tarbuck for almost a fortnight.

The veteran comedian was questioned by North Yorkshire Police on April 26 over claims he sexually abused a young boy in the 1970s.

But news of the 73-year-old’s controversial arrest did not emerge until it was discovered by the Mail 11 days later.
