North Korea sent special forces teams to the US in the 1990s to target nuclear power stations and conduct terror attacks on major cities in the event of war, a declassified intelligence report has revealed.

The rogue state successfully infiltrated five units of highly-trained commandos onto U.S. soil ready to strike at key installations, according to a Defense Intelligence Agency report dated September 13, 2004. 

The report states that the North Korean Ministry of People’s Armed Forces 'established five liaison offices in the early 1990s, to train and infiltrate operatives into the United States to attack nuclear power plants and major cities in case of hostilities.'

They 'had agents in place to attack American nuclear power plants', it continues, 'in the event of hostilities between the United States and DPRK'.

Military experts believe that the commando units were brought in because at the time North Korea lacked any long-range missiles capable of hitting the U.S.

The report adds: 'One of the driving forces behind the establishment of the units and infiltration of operatives was the slow progress in developing a multi-stage ballistic missile.' 

The rogue state was then under the control of Kim Jong il

Today the rogue state is believed to have at least two types of long-range ballistic missile  capable of reaching the U.S.

North Korea has one of the largest number of Special Forces in the world with more than 60,000 commandos under control of the shadowy Reconnaissance Bureau, part of the country’s Armed Forces.

The Bureau is known to have been behind a string of terror attacks over the years including airline bombing, kidnaps and assassinations. 

The source of the information is not disclosed but may have come from a defector or electronic surveillance.

The redacted document was recently released thorough a Freedom of Information Act request, the Washington Free Beacon reports. 

It comes after hackers, believed to be working on behalf of North Korea, successfully forced Sony to withdraw a comedy film about a plot to assassinate Kim Jong un.

The Interview, which depicts a catastrophic attempt to assassinate the North Korean dictator, will not be shown in cinemas and is understood to have been shelved indefinitely.

The hackers, who are believed to work for a sophisticated cyber-warfare cell called Bureau 121, issued a a terrifying warning to American audiences, telling them to ‘remember September 11, 2001’.

They stole an estimated 100 terabytes of data including unreleased films and could cost the movie studio hundreds of millions of dollars.

The U.S. government said yesterday it was weighing the proportional response to the sophisticated perpetrator of a cyberattack that crippled Sony Pictures, exposed its executives and led to the cancellation of the film 'The Interview.'

Spokesman Josh Earnest said the White House is not in a position to confirm that North Korea is responsible for the hack at Sony, after a US official said Wednesday that Washington may soon formally announce the involvement of the Pyongyang government. 

The effect of any response, such as cyber retaliation or financial sanctions, could be limited, U.S. experts said.
