Human cannonball Matthew Cranch, 24, as killed when the safety net intended to break his fall after he was fired into the air collapsed

A human cannonball died when a faulty catch released the safety net as he flew into the air in front of hundreds of spectators, an inquest heard yesterday.

Matthew Cranch, 24, was a ‘thrill-seeker’ who had become a stuntman only a week before the tragedy.

His final moments were captured on video and played at the inquest yesterday – with the safety net suddenly falling to the ground as he left the mouth of the cannon.

The short but dramatic video started with a ‘3-2-1-Fire!’ countdown and, accompanied by the flash of a firework to simulate gunfire, Mr Cranch shot out of the end of the cannon.

As he left the barrel, the large rope net below immediately fell flat to the ground.

Mr Cranch continued on a brief upwards arc, hunching into a near ball as he prepared for a headlong dive to the ground. The video was stopped before the moment of impact. Mr Cranch’s parents and sister left the room before the video was played.

Two health and safety experts told the hearing that a fault in the machinery holding the netting in place meant that it could be loose despite clicking into position.

The recoil from the firing set off enough vibrations to shake the safety net loose – meaning Mr Cranch was doomed to fall 40ft to the ground. Paramedics and an air ambulance crew could do nothing to save him. 

Mechanical engineer Alex Grimes said he staged experiments with the cannon and found that the quick-release safety catch for the netting was liable to appear locked while in fact being dangerously loose. He added that it seemed to have been left dirty for years, adding to the risk.

Mr Grimes said: ‘The safety net release latch could be “falsely closed”. This made the latch susceptible to opening by movement or vibration. 

If the latch was set up in the “false-closed” position, the firing of the cannon could cause the release of the safety catch, causing the net to collapse.’

Present at the inquest in Maidstone, Kent, yesterday was stunt motorcyclist Scott May, 38, who employed Mr Cranch for the show at Kent County Showground in Detling in April 2011.

He was represented by barrister Tania Robinson, who tried to stop the video of the accident being shown to the jury, claiming it was ‘unnecessary, emotive and distressing’.

Mr Cranch suffered multiple injuries when he plunged to the ground after being fired from this cannon during Scott May's Daredevil Stunt Show, jurors at the inquest into his death were told

Two staff who worked on the human cannonball device – Tommy Austin and Tony Nicholls – were also at the inquest.

Mr Cranch’s parents – Michael, 69, a company director, and Pauline, 65, a teacher – and sister Eleanor asked the coroner that their son be described as a ‘mechanic’.

They sat alongside representatives from Maidstone Borough Council who took over a health and safety inquiry into the death started by police.

Coroner Patricia Harding began the hearing by leading the jury through an explanation of how the ‘cannon’, mounted on the back of a lorry, worked.

As Mr Cranch was fired out of the cannon, the net collapsed, causing him to land on the ground

At the time of Mr Cranch's death, his friends described him as a ‘thrill-seeker’ who opted out of his promising academic career and his conventional middle-class upbringing

It contained a large bucket attached to the mouth of the barrel by eight thick elasticated ropes.

Mr Cranch – described by a school friend as a ‘thrill-seeker’ – climbed into the mouth of the cannon and stood in the bucket, and a mechanised winch pulled it backwards, stretching the ropes taut.

After a dramatic countdown, the bucket was suddenly released – and flew up to the mouth of the cannon, some 25ft in the air. A restraint stopped the bucket abruptly at the cannon mouth, and the momentum meant ‘cannonball’ Mr Cranch carried on travelling upwards, and flew 10ft or higher into the air.

Mr Cranch had been fired from the cannon mounted on this lorry in front of a crowd of spectators at the showground in Detling, Kent, on April 25, 2011

Miss Robinson told the hearing the stunt had been staged 900 times without the quick-release safety catch failing.

Mr Austin, responsible for attaching the safety net to the lorry with two colleagues, said: ‘I checked it was secure by pulling on the metal wire and putting body weight on the net itself.’ He was unaware there was a danger of the latch having a ‘false-closed’ position.

Kent Police announced in 2012 that there would be no prosecutions over the incident. The hearing continues.

The tragedy happened in front of the assembled crowds who had paid £12 to see the stunt show

Mr Cranch had suffered serious injuries to his heart, head and chest and died in the ambulance after suffering a cardiac arrest two minutes before arriving at hospital, the inquest was told
