Images have emerged showing a security guard unconscious on the floor after he was knocked out by a teenager at a school struggling with discipline.

Alphonso Stevenson, a 63-year-old conflict resolution specialist hired to quell the violence at Bartram High School in Philadelphia, was allegedly assaulted by a 17-year-old student on March 21.

Stevenson was greeting students as they walked to class when the teenager knocked his clipboard from his hands, and when Stevenson went to reach it, the boy allegedly pushed him against a wall.

The staff member's head smashed against a wall, knocking him unconscious and leaving him with a fractured skull, concussion and other injuries, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported.

Attack: Alphonso Stevenson, a security guard at Bartram High School in Philadelphia is pictured on the floor after a 17-year-old student allegedly hit his head against a wall following an argument

'It sounded like a melon hitting the wall,' social studies teacher Stephen Pfeiffer said.

As he lay on the floor, students swarmed around him and snapped photographs before sharing them on social networks. Meanwhile, the teenager who had allegedly assaulted him ran off.

But he was stopped by school police and has been charged as a juvenile with aggravated assault, simple assault and other charges, authorities said.

Stevenson has been 
released from hospital and is recovering at home.

Hurt: The 63-year-old suffered a fractured skull, concussion and other injuries and the teen was arrested

This is just the latest violent act at the school, which employees complain is understaffed and where students say their classmates rule the hallways.

The school has struggled with fights, drug use and violent crime, as well as teachers and principals transferring out after just weeks on the job. Cars and laptops have also been stolen at the school.

'I had a better chance in Vietnam,' Pfeiffer, an Army veteran, told the Inquirer. 'Here, you lock your door and pray no one comes in.'

The school has long endured unruly students - in 1999, an assistant principal was shot by a student - but teachers claim that the teenagers are even more out of control now.

They largely put it down to budget cuts, which has left them with 100 extra students from a nearby school that closed but the same number of staff.

Teachers told the Inquirer that they have been told not to ask for help before 9.30am because there are no staff members to help them.

'There are fights constantly,' one teacher said. 'I call
 downstairs for help - sometimes they answer and sometimes they don't.'

Another added: 'I'm even getting anxious to walk the halls any more.'

The school district superintendent has acknowledged that the school has problems and he is sending a respected former district principal in an effort to calm the school, he said.
