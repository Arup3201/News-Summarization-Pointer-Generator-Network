The pilot of a hot air balloon that crashed during a pleasure ride and killed four people did not have a licence, air safety officials have revealed.

Six people are still in a critical condition and 28 were injured after the balloon hit a tree and burst into flames  near the Slovenian capital, Ljubljana.

The pilot's licence was confiscated on June 7 because he needed to retake some health exams, according to Ziga Kotnik, head of the civil aviation authority.

He told local media: 'The pilot did not have a proper licence.'

Hot air balloon expert Darko Kralj told 
local television that a thunderstorm which broke just before the doomed 
flight took off was so severe it would have been 'better to have a 
coffee and not to fly.'

Meanwhile speculation was growing that 
one of the four dead was British 
after the UK Foreign Office said that two British citizens were 
involved.

None of the casualties have been officially identified following the horror crash during the tourist excursion.

They were too badly burned to be identified, and many of the survivors were also so severely injured that it had not been possible 
to talk to them properly.

Novo
Mesto Clinic's medical director Mira Retelj, however, said that those hospitalised included only one 
British woman - indicating that if there was a second passenger then they
must have been one of those killed.

A British woman who was being treated for head injuries left the hospital early Friday without speaking to the media.

The Britons were believed to have been on holiday in the central European country.

A Foreign Office spokesman in London said: ‘We are aware of the hospitalisation of two British nationals.’

The official STA news agency said two hot air balloons were in the air at the time of the crash.

They set off at 5.30 in the morning to catch the sunrise.

Just after 8am, witnesses said they 
saw one of the balloons, carrying 32 people reportedly including six 
children, crash into a tree as it attempted to land 
during a storm.

Several witnesses who were working in a field nearby said they saw victims leaping from the basket to escape the flames.

One said: ‘The balloon was caught in a
sudden storm, there was lightning but I don’t know if that hit the 
balloon, but I saw the balloon hit the tree and then I saw people 
starting to fall out.

‘The balloon basket hit the ground 
fast, some of the people inside fell out but then the basket went back 
up into the air with others still inside – and this time it was on 
fire.’

Emergency services arrive at the scene of the crash which saw four people killed and a British woman among the 28 injured

Janez Cimperman, mayor of the small 
rural community of Ig, where the accident happened, said: ‘People were 
either falling from the basket of the balloon or jumping from it. It was
horrible to watch.’

More than 70 rescuers from the 
capital Ljubljana, seven miles away, were on the scene within minutes 
and spoke of the carnage that greeted them.

A medic who was among the 
first at the scene told local media he had seen four charred bodies 
lying on the ground.

At least ten others needed to be resuscitated at the scene.

Tomaz Kucic, head of the firefighting team, said they extinguished the fire.

The British woman was said to be 
among survivors then taken to the Ljubljana Clinical Centre. It is 
believed she was later moved with four others to a nearby hospital at 
Novo Mesto.  

Locals where the accident happened said the balloons should never have set off as the weather was bad.

But other reports said there had been a sudden storm, which caught the operators unaware.

It was reported that the second balloon landed safely.
