It's a hobby enjoyed the world over - what could be better than spending a few hours kayaking across a shimmering mountain lake admiring the stunning scenery while keeping fit?

Unfortunately, transporting all that bulky equipment around can prove a real headache and then you've got to find somewhere to store it.

But now, an enterprising kayak enthusiast from California has come up with an ingenious solution - a 12-foot long kayak that can fold away into a small plastic case.

The Origami Kayak: The Oru looks like any normal kayak, but can be folded away into a small plastic case and re-assembled within five minutes

Compact: The plastic case measures 32in by 29in and weighs 25lbs. It can fit in the boot of a car or checked into the hold of an aircraft

Resilient: The fold-up kayak is just as durable as a normal moulded one and has a lifetime guarantee of 20,000 folds

Anton Willis, an architect by trade, has designed the origami boat after being forced to pay for storage when he couldn't fit a conventional kayak into his apartment.

The Oru kayak folds into a compact case measuring 32in by 29in and weighing 25lb which can be stored anywhere - even in the luggage hold when flying.

When unfolded, Mr Willis, 36, says you can assemble it and be out on the water in five minutes.

Fully equipped: A standard fold-away paddle can fit easily inside the kayak when packed into the plastic case

Plenty of space: The Oru is 12ft long and 25 inches wide

Transportable: Inventor Anton Willis says the Oru can be carried anywhere. The architect and kayak enthusiast had not been able to store his boat in his apartment

He said: 'I grew up in rural Northern California, kayaking the rivers and coast. When I moved to the city a few years ago, I had to put my kayak in storage, as it wouldn't fit in my apartment.

'At the same time, I read a magazine article on new advances in the art and science of origami, and started thinking- 'what if a boat could fold up like a piece of paper?'

'The Oru Kayak is made of a single, seamless sheet of corrugated plastic. It's a heavy-duty version of a material often used for packaging and signage.

Testing the waters: Kayakers try out the Oru on still waters, but the inventor says it will also withstand extreme conditions

Sense of adventure: The Oru kayak is available later this month and costs £500

'It's very tough and durable, as well as lightweight. We have tested it in extreme conditions, including ocean surf, and never had a skin breach.

'The case can hold a breakdown paddle, life jacket, and other accessories too.'

What's more, the Oru is fully recyclable and used 70 per cent less petroleum to manufacture than its standard moulded counterparts.

Mr Willis claims the kayak is guaranteed for 20,000 folds throughout its lifetime.

The Oru Kayak will be available for pre-order Nov 14th from Kickstarter.com, for £500.
