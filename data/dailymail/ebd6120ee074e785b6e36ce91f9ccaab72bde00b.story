Survivors of the capsized Costa Concordia have today been commemorating the second anniversary of the disaster which killed 32 people.

Former passengers of the ship marked the occasion by laying two wreaths in the water beside the ship which is still stranded off the coast of Giglio island, near Tuscany, before a planned candlelight march this evening.

Judges and survivors alike also stood in silence Monday morning inside the theater-turned-courtroom where Capt. Francesco Schettino is on trial.

Sailors on board a coastguard boat today laid a wreath beside the wreckage of the Costa Concordia to commemorate the second anniversary of the crash

Survivors of the crash that killed 32 people also laid their own tribute in the shadow of the wreck

In total 32 people were killed when the luxury cruise liner ran aground in 2012 near Giglio island

Schettino stands accused of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning the Concordia before all passengers had been evacuated. He denies all charges and says his actions saved lives.

The wreck of the Concordia cruise liner is due to be removed from the waters by Giglio's port in June after an unprecedented salvage operation.

In September crews pulled off a feat of engineering by righting the 115-tonne, 1,000-foot-long wreckage in preparation for it to be towed away.

Giglio Mayor Sergio Ortelli said: 
'Definitely (this anniversary) is something that takes us back to that 
terrible night, even if today we are looking at this anniversary ... 
with a light that is a little bit different.

There will be a candlelit march across the island later today as well as a service in the church which provided shelter for the victims after the diaster

In the coming months 30 tanks filled with air will be used to lift the wreckage off of the seabed

'Today we are looking forward optimistically to what will be the final operation.'

Giglio's commemorations began with a Mass in the church that welcomed in survivors following the shipwreck in 2012. 

The day will end with an evening 
candlelight procession to mark the exact time - 9.45 pm - that the 
Concordia slammed into a reef and capsized.

Schettino
 is accused of having taken the ship off course in a stunt to bring it 
closer to Giglio, and then delaying the evacuation order until it was 
too late to lower many of the lifeboats from the listing liner.

'Two years means that, let's not say 
we've gotten used to it, but almost,' said Giglio resident Giuseppe 
Modeste. 'But eventually this wreck will be taken away.'

It took crews an entire night using an intricate pulley system to right the ship from where it ran aground

Ports are now fighting over the right to dismantle the cruise liner, a contract which could be worth Â£200m

In the coming months, a total of 30 giant tanks will be affixed to both sides of the Concordia to float it off the false seabed where it is resting, so it can be towed to a port to be dismantled for scrap.

Five Italian ports are vying for the contract, but ports in Turkey, France and even China have also submitted bids.

The ship owner, Costa Crociere SpA, is a unit of Miami-based Carnival Corp., the world's largest cruise line operator.
