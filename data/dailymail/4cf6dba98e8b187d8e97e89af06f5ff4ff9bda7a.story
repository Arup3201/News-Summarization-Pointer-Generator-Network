An eight-year-old girl has died in suburban Johannesburg after she was allegedly kicked and beaten by three male pupils at her school

Lebohang Makala returned home from school on Valentine’s Day, visibly in pain and with swollen legs.

She told her mother that three boys at her school in Soweto had begun to hit her while she was playing with her friends.

Tragedy: Lebohang Makala died on Friday, one week after she returned home from Batsogile Primary School in Soweto, Johannesburg (pictured) limping and in pain, saying three boys had started hitting her for no reason

Lebohang said that three boys at Batsogile Primary School had attacked her 'for no reason', while responsible teachers were absent.

One boy had used his fists to punch her in the head, after which the trio threw her to the floor and kept hitting her while she laid helplessly on the ground, Lebohang’s mother Martha Makala told The Daily Sun.

Ms Malaka took her daughter to a local hospital where she was examined and given pain medication.

After several sleepless nights with Lebohang crying in pain, her mother took her back to the hospital the following Thursday.

Last Friday, a week after the schoolyard attack, Lebohang died in hospital from excessive internal bleeding.

Attacked: Lebohang, from Soweto (pictured), died in hospital from excessive internal bleeding, but not until the following Monday did the school report the incident to the education department

An investigation had now been launched by the local education department in Soweto after it emerged that the school failed to report the incident.

‘This matter only came to our attention yesterday,’ Gauteng education department spokesperson Phumla Sekhonyane told the South African Press Association today.

‘An independent investigation has been instituted to investigate the circumstances around this incident.’

‘We immediately dispatched a team to the school, as well as a team to assist with counselling for the mother of the deceased and the school,’ she said.

‘We are looking into why this matter was not reported to the Gauteng department of education head office.’

Ms Sekhonyane said officials had met Lebohang’s parents on Monday but that any further details would be kept under wraps until the investigatyion is concluded, adding thatr the education department are ‘very concerned’.

‘An investigation was only opened yesterday by the parents. There was no case reported to the police before that and the school did not open a case,’ Police spokesman Warrant Officer Kay Makhubela said.

‘We just got [information] that the child was injured in school. The circumstances of what transpired will be looked into.’
