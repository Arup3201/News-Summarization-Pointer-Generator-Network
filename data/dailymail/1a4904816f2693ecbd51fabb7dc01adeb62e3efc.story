A Russian man who was fined after his pet bear did its business outside a Russian newsagents has escaped having to pay after pointing out to police that the law only applies to dogs.

Robert Biryukov was walking his bear cub down Lomonosov Avenue in the  capital Moscow when the animal was suddenly caught short.

He said: 'It had been snowing so I suppose it was a bit more obvious than usual, and I didn't have a bag with me when suddenly shop owner came out and started shouting.

Bear placed cheek: The cub was caught short during a walk around Moscow. It's owner admitted that the result was 'more obvious than usual' as it had been snowing

'Then two policemen who were walking nearby came over and got involved, and told me I had to clean it up. When I pointed out I didn't have a bag, they tried to fine me.'

But when the 27-year-old pointed out that law only applied to dogs, police officers let him off with a warning.

He agreed to come back later and clean up the mess with a shovel.

He said: 'I have trained my bear to do all sorts of tricks as he is really smart, but I can't seem to train him not to do his business in inappropriate places.'

He said: 'He is completely safe and well trained apart from one small issue of where exactly he is allowed to relieve himself. 

'I voluntarily keep him on a lead and make him wear a muzzle, but to be honest it is not really necessary but it makes people less nervous.

'But although he is pretty tall when he stands up he is still really only a baby.'

Although not a common sight on the streets many Russians do keep bears as pets and it is perfectly legal to do so.

Bears are still forced to perform in circuses although campaigners are calling for the practice to be banned saying it is amounts to animal cruelty.
