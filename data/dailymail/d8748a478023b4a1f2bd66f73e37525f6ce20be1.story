A spurned teenager plunged a knife into his ex-girlfriend's back to make her 'feel the same pain he was going through', a court has heard.

Thomas Dalton, went to the house of Samantha Laney, 19, 'angry and frustrated' and stabbed her to death.

However, the 19-year-old claimed he was struggling to cope following the breakdown of his relationship with Miss Laney when he attacked her in February this year.

Murder charge: Thomas Dalton, 19, (left) is accused of stabbing Samantha Laney, 19, after lying in wait outside her home before launching a vicious attack on her and her father

Giving evidence at his murder trial, Dalton described how he went to Samantha’s home in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire armed with the six inch blade feeling but claimed he did not intend to kill her, telling a jury: 'I just wanted to hurt her, because she’d hurt me.

'I wanted to hurt her, just to make her feel how I felt.'

He decided to confront his ex during a telephone conversation with her, the court was told.

After rolling 'two or three' cannabis joints, Dalton then borrowed a friend's bike and cycled to Miss Laney's house, waiting more than an hour for her to return, he told the court.

He burst into her home before launching his vicious attack.

He added: 'It was while I was talking to her on the phone. That’s when I picked up the knife. I borrowed a bike from a friend and cycled to Clayton.

Dalton is also accused of the attempted murder of Miss Laney's father Steven (pictured), during the attack at their home in Newcastle-under-Lyme

'I wrapped the knife in a bag and rolled two or three spliffs. I was angry. I went to kick the back door open. Sam’s friend was there.

'That’s when I pulled the knife out. I shouted, "Where’s Sam?" I turned a corner and saw her. I couldn’t see anyone else. I was totally focused on Sam.

'As soon as I stabbed her I looked at the knife and it was like I’d just woken up. I thought, "What have I done?" I turned around and walked out.'

The single stab wound to the back punctured Miss Laney's lung and severed an artery. She bled to death.

Despite Dalton admitting he had previously threatened to kill his ex-girlfriend, he insisted that at the time of the stabbing his intentions were only to hurt her.

He also denies attempting to murder Miss Laney's father Steven, who he fought with immediately after the attack.

The court heard how Dalton was diagnoses with a condition called adjustment disorder (AD) at the time of the stabbing.

Consultant forensic psychiatrist Dr Stewart Vaggers said: 'Adjustment disorder is a reaction to a stressful life event, such as a bereavement or a separation.

'It fits in between more severe mental illness and a normal reaction. Patients are capable of quite dramatic behaviour, and also violent behaviour.'

People suffering from AD would have impaired judgement, it would not necessarily hamper their ability to plan ahead, Dr Vaggers added.

Earlier in the trial, the court heard from another forensic psychiatrist, Dr Tom Clarke, who did not believe Dalton was suffering from AD.

At the opening of the trial Philip Bennetts QC, prosecuting, said Dalton had told Samantha he was going to 'slice her open' after she ended their relationship in January.

The court also heard shortly after the killing, Dalton updated his Facebook profile, saying: 'Some things got to be done in life.'

Dalton, of Kidsgrove, Staffordshire, denies murder and attempted murder.

The trial continues.
