Crystal Palace want to offer Swansea City striker Michu a return to the Premier League if he recovers successfully from ankle surgery.

Palace boss Neil Warnock is pressing to sign a goalscorer in the January transfer window and is prepared to rescue Michu from an unhappy loan spell with Napoli where he has failed to score in his five matches played.

The Spaniard is currently recovering from an operation to trim his right ankle but is expected to be able to play in the second half of the season.

Michu has made five appearances for Napoli since moving on a season-long loan from Swansea this summer

The forward could be allowed to move to another club on loan for the second half of the season

Michu scored 18 league goals during his first season with Swansea, but struggled with injury in his second

Neil Warnock wants to add more fire power to his squad in  January   and is considering a move for Michu

Swansea sent the 28-year-old on a season-long loan to Serie A with manager Garry Monk making Wilfried Bony the new focal point of his attack.

But Michu's time under Rafa Benitez has been so unhappy the Italians may allow him to move on to another club on loan.

Palace also like another Swansea forward Bafetimbi Gomis but are scared off by the £7million price tag.
