Six-time World Championship finalist Jimmy White has told of his battle with crack cocaine addiction.

The 'Whirlwind', 52, became a huge fans' favourite in the 1980s and 90s, reaching the Crucible final in 1984 and in every year from 1990 to 1994 but losing on each occasion - four of those to Stephen Hendry.

White, though, was hiding a drug habit which cost him up to £10,000 a month after moving from cocaine to its stronger form.

White ranks fifth in the all-time rankings of British prize money earned by a snooker player. The 52-year-old has collected £4,673,066 during his career with Stephen Hendry leading the way on £8,722,739. During this time White won 10 professional ranking tournaments listed below:

The Classic (1986, 1991)

Grand Prix (1986, 1992)

British Open (1987, 1992)

Canadian Open (1989)

European Open (1992)

UK Championship (1992)

Players Championship (2004) 

White, who told The Sun 'I'm lucky to be alive' and admitted drugs 'probably cost me 10 world titles', told of smoking crack with his close friend and fellow player Kirk Stevens in a hotel room at the Irish Masters. 

He wrote in his new autobiography Second Wind, serialised in the same newspaper: 'Jimmy White... snooker hero... people's champion... crack addict. Sounds far-fetched, doesn't it? But for about three crazy months it was true.

'I think Kirk tried it first but I'm my own man and I don't blame anyone else for making me do something as stupid as smoking crack. The blame for that lies at my door only.'

White admitted he had 'frittered away' most of the prize money from his illustrious career, during which he won 23 professional titles including the 1984 Masters, the 1992 UK Championship and two Grand Prix crowns.

Recalling the financial cost of his habit, he wrote: 'I had one sneaky account with NatWest. I started dipping into this every now and then to fund my crack habit.

'I did the lot in less than three months. Every penny.' 

White rose to prominence when he became the 1980 World Amateur Snooker champion - aged 18.

The London-born star's achievement made him the youngest-ever winner of the tournament before he turned professional later that year.

The left-hander's first taste of success on the professional circuit came in 1981 where he won both the Scottish Masters and Northern Ireland classic defeating Cliff Thorburn and Steve Davis in the respective finals.

White has since gone on to win 17 other non-ranking tournaments with his last success coming in the 2010 World Seniors Championship.

In ranked events, the 52-year-old has won 10 titles but never the World Championship. His last triumph at a ranked event came in the 2004 Players Championship against Paul Hunter - beating him 9-7.

A popular player, White's highest ranking was No 2 in the world between 1987-88 - a lofty 53 positions better than his current state.

The 'Whirlwind' ranks fifth in the all-time rankings of British prize money earned by a snooker player having collected £4,673,066 during his career. Hendry tops the charts with £8,722,739.
