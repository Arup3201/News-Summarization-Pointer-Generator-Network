Carlos Tevez has revealed he has no intention of extending his contract with Juventus after 2016.

The Argentina striker has been linked with a return to Boca Juniors when his present deal at the Italian champions expires, though Juve would like to keep him until 2018.

But it seems the former West Ham, Manchester United and Manchester City striker feels he will be ready for a new challenge.

'I said I wanted to fulfil my contract and that's my idea, I'm not thinking of signing an extension because that's not how I feel at the moment,' Tevez told reporters in Buenos Aires on Wednesday before returning to Turin from the year-end holidays.

'As I always said, my idea is to complete my contract. Everyone knows I said so from the moment I arrived at Juve.'

However, Tevez, who has been in fine form since joining Juventus from City last year and earned an Argentina recall in October after a three-year international absence, said it was too soon for him to think of returning to his first club Boca.

'I have a year-and-a-half left on my contract and it's complicated to leave when you're playing well at this level.

'I have to take things calmly and enjoy and not go crazy with the idea of coming back (to Buenos Aires).'
