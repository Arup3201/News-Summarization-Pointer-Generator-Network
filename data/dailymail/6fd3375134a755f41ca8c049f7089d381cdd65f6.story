If a week chained to the desk or the tools beckons, as it does for most, best look away - Abe Kislevitz is very unlikely to be your favourite person right now.

Abe, 27, is an adrenaline junkie from San Francisco whose job includes going on epic adventures on slopes, surf and in the sky, and capturing them for others to envy on his camera.

As part of his role as a senior production artist for GoPro, Abe takes incredible images of himself and others living it up, from surfing the world's finest breaks to skiing the resorts of France, Chile and New Zealand. No wonder he considers this the 'perfect' job.

It helps that he's a bit impressive at all of these things, with some shots including him mid backflip on the snow or grinding on his skis. Oh, and he also mountain bikes and climbs, but just as much he enjoys capturing the sunset after a big day's action.  

'Over the past few years my job and adventure seeking have taken me around the world,' Abe said. 'It's led me to want to share and document the incredible sights I was coming across.

'The GoPro camera is the perfect tool to have on me at all times and I'm constantly seeking new ways to use it and capture unique perspectives inside and outside of my job.

'Outside of work, I'm an active outdoor enthusiast where freestyle skiing is my main source of adventure year-round. Surfing is my local after-work fix during the week. Beyond that I'm into anything that'll give some good adrenaline and require some hard work and progression.

'It's pretty obvious but I'm doing things that give me a ton of adrenaline and capturing epic moments at the same time. It's a dream come true for a creative person that loves adventure.' 

As they say, the proof that he's right is in the pictures. 

Dream job: Abe Kislevitz, 27, travels the world shooting videos, commercials and stills for the action cameria company GoPro

Regular fix: When at home in San Francisco, surfing his local breaks is Abe's usual means of getting the rush he craves

Soaring and smiling: Adrenaline junkie Kislevitz shows his flipping skills on skis and if he not screaming with delight and grinning

Not too cool: Abe might be the action-adventure freak many of us envy, but it's not beyond the skilled 27-year-old to take a selfie atop a mountain at Whistler

Grinding it out: It's not always sunshine and perfect moves for Abe - here he make working a rail look easy but on the right he works through a whiteout 

Wheel-deal: When he's not surfing, or skiing, or climbing, Abe can be found hitting the road on a bike - anything that offers a rush he's up for it

Next adventure: Yes ladies, Abe likes sunsets too - here he takes a selfie as he prepares to get on a plane in Alaska
