Fast food chain In-N-Out Burger may only have outlets in five states but its reputation for fine hamburgers is known throughout the land.

The chain is notoriously 
strict about what products it sells and for over 65 years its menu has 
consisted of three burger varieties: hamburger, cheeseburger, and 
‘Double-Double’ (double meat/double cheese), plus French fries and 
drinks.

Now a new innovation has been uncovered, but don't expect it to appear on the menu at In-N-Out any time soon.

'Monkey Style' burgers: In-N-Out employees won't admit to its existence, but that doesn't have to stop you from simply creating your own

Inspired by chat on Twitter about the emergence of a new 'Monkey Style' burger, the food blog Foodbeast took a trip to an In-N-Out Burger to see what all the fuss was about.

The 'Monkey Style' burger is a hamburger but with addition of a portion of  'Animal Style' fries (that's french fries covered with spread, cheese and grilled onions) sitting alongside the patty in between the buns.

The Foodbeast crew couldn't get an In-N-Out employee to admit on camera to the existence of the 'Monkey Style' burger, but that didn't stop them from simply creating there own.

Earlier this year a chef at an In-N-Out Burger revealed some of the secret food experiments that go on in the kitchen after the last customers has left.

Since it launched in 1948 the chain's menu has consisted of three burger varieties: hamburger, cheeseburger, and 'Double-Double', plus French fries and drinks

The beauty of the West Coast burger 
chain's simple menu is the different tiers of customization you can 
accomplish with a simple base of hamburgers, cheeseburgers, fries and 
drinks.

The restrictive 
menu hasn’t stopped In-N-Out chefs from experimenting after hours, 
coming up with their own combinations and adding other foods to the mix 
including bacon.

‘Took bacon in to cook after closing and it really changes everything,’ raved dravila9, the username of an Arizona chef who posted his revelations on the ‘Ask Me Anything’ forum on Reddit.com.

‘Sweet Jesus it was the greatest thing I've ever had!’ he said of his bacon burger and animal fries topped with torn up burger patties and bacon, smothered in Famous Dave's BBQ sauce. 

Another illicit invention concocted by Dravila9 after closing time were donuts made by squirting milkshake syrup onto buns and dunking them in the fryer.

The 'not-so-secret menu' on the In-N-Out Burger website features several items that can be ordered at the fast food chain

A super baked potato was also created by
 coring a potato, frying it and then filling it with chopped burger 
patties, melted cheese, onions, chiles and tomatoes.

However dravila9 reserved his biggest 
praise for an item that only gets served at the company's annual family 
picnics - chili dogs.

‘OMG if In-N-Out sold the chili dogs they give at the family picnics the world really wouldn't be able to handle it,’ he wrote.

Unfortunately these delicious sounding delights are unlikely to be available to eat any time soon. The company’s menu has barely changed since the chain was launched 65 years old in Southern California.

The company already has a 'secret menu', which it actually publicizes it on the company’s website and includes the ‘Protein Style’ Burger, which is a burger wrapped in crisp Iceberg lettuce instead of a bun, ‘Animal-Style Fries,’ which has grilled onions, pickles and cheese piled on top of French fries.

Another noteworthy non-menu item is the ‘Neapolitan Shake,’ a creamy blend of chocolate, vanilla and strawberry ice cream.

Experts have attributed much of the chains success to the fact that it has focused on 
producing a limited number of items very well and hasn’t expanded to include chicken or fish products or launch a breakfast menu.

In-N-Out has achieved a glowing reputation by doing things at its own pace. So far it has so far resisted becoming a franchise or a publically listed company. It currently has less than 300 branches across five western states: California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah and Texas

As well as a highly loyal customer base some of its biggest fans including renowned chefs including Gordon Ramsay, Thomas Keller, Julia Child, Anthony Bourdain, and Mario Batali.
