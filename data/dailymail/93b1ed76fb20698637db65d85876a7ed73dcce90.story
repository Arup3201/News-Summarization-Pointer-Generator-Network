Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow cabinet office minister, accused the coalition of 'electioneering at the tax payers expense'

The coalition has been accused of 'electioneering at the tax payers expense' after launching a multimillion pound newspaper and television assault to promote its policies, it has been reported.

The Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats are said to be using public money to fund campaigns that highlight their Help to Buy Scheme and superfast broadband.

Other adverts were said to include those raising awareness of healthy school meals and improvements to the health service. 

'Ministers need to justify this immediately,' Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow cabinet office minister, told The Times.

'This looks like shameless electioneering at taxpayers' expense.'

The Government's Help to Buy 30 second advert reached a prime time television audience after appearing during the hit ITV series Broadchurch starring David Tennant.

A spokesman for the Treasury told the MailOnline that the advertisement, that is set to run for three months, has been paid for by the banks.  

'For the scheme to support homebuyers across the UK, as many people as possible need to know how it works and understand if they are eligible,' said the spokesman.

'That's why the Government have developed a targeted public information campaign. The costs are funded by fees paid by the mortgage lenders under the scheme, not the taxpayer.

'So far, Help to Buy has helped 71,000 people realise their home owning aspirations, and is a key part of our long term economic plan that has ensured that first-time home buyers in 2014 rose to their highest level since 2007.'

The government's Department for Culture, Media and Sport told the Times their superfast broadband awareness campaign would provide 'value for money for the tax payer,' as contractors BT will return more money to the public purse as more people sign up. 

The Cabinet Office said they have actually halved the cost of government communications since the 2010 general election.The proposed spend for this year was £289 million.

 'As part of our long-term economic plan we have halved the cost to taxpayers of government communications since the 2010 General Election,' he said. 

'We are now coordinating this centrally to ensure it is properly focused and effective, using low-cost campaigns whenever practical. 

'All marketing and advertising delivers coalition government priorities, for example supporting our Help to buy scheme which is helping hardworking people buy a home, army recruitment and improving public health.'
