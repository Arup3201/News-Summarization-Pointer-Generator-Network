Police have admitted they are baffled by the disappearance of a University of Cincinnati student who vanished five days ago when he went outside to retrieve his dropped cell phone.

Brogan Dulle, 21, has not been seen since about 2am on Sunday after returning to his Clifton Heights apartment block following a night out with friends.

Surveillance footage shows the group of friends heading down the road before the group jumps into a car to go to a Taco Bell, while Dulle heads into the apartment block.

But moments later - leaving behind his jacket and phone and leaving his keys still in the door - he returns to the sidewalk with a flashlight to look for his cell phone, police believe.

Where is Brogan? Brogan Dulle vanished on Sunday after a night out with friends and police have said they have no leads. His parents, Beth and Tom (pictured), said they had no idea why he would disappear

The footage, which was taken from a nearby home, shows him wandering slowly along the road with the light before he walks out of the view of the camera.

Dulle hasn't been seen since and officials have admitted that they have no idea where he is.

Cincinnati Police Lt. Col. James Whalen said at a press conference that the department is stumped.

'We are basically into our 
fifth full day here that Brogan's been missing and we've exhausted most of 
the leads we can find,' Whalen said. 'I don't know any more about where he is today
 than when I first found out about this Monday evening.'

Last sighting: He was captured on surveillance footage walking near his apartment block on Sunday

Mystery: Police believe he had left his apartment to look for his cell phone along the route he had just walked

'It's 
unusual that we donâ€™t get a phone call. Somebody saw something,' he added, but stressed that they had no evidence of foul play.

He added that friends said Dulle gave no indication that he had any thoughts to leave the area, and he did not have a car, WLWT reported.

Whalen released the video to help the search for Dulle and called it 'our most valuable piece of evidence' so far. He thanked the resident for the video and the media for spreading the word.

Dulle's parents said on Friday that they first felt concerned about their dependable son's whereabouts when they learned he'd missed swim class on Sunday and work on Monday.

'Brogan, we love you and miss you terribly,' his mother, Beth Dulle, said in the press conference. 'We're worried sick about 
you. We need you home. Nothing is more important than
 you being home with us.'

Massive search: Laura Lewis, spokesperson for the Dulle family, adjusts a sign near the university campus. Hundreds of friends, relatives, classmates and strangers have joined the hunt for the man

Concern: Brogan, pictured center with his dad and brother, has not been seen since the early hours of Sunday

Tom Dulle added that he knew of no reasons why his son would disappear, but that, 'we'll deal with the reasons after we find him', Cincinnati.com reported.

Friends, relatives and classmates have now launched a massive search for the young man. They have passed out fliers, looked in homeless shelters and scoured nearby wooded areas.

More than $13,000 has also been raised to help fund search efforts and a reward of $25,000 has been offered for information leading to his return.

Courtney Knowles Hass, Dulle's cousin, said the family is so grateful for the support.

'Each painful day that passes is eased by the love and support we are seeing in each one of you,' she wrote online.
