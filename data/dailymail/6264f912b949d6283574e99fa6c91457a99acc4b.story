Arsenal are concerned Mathieu Debuchy will miss three months if he needs an operation on his dislocated shoulder.

The France right back suffered the injury in Sunday’s 3-0 win over Stoke City following a shove by Marko Arnautovic, who has escaped FA sanctioning over the incident.

Debuchy will see a specialist in the next 48 hours to establish whether an operation is required.

The news comes as a major blow to the Gunners, who have been plagued by defensive injuries all season, and Debuchy  only returned from a three-month spell out with an ankle injury in December.

Goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, reprimanded for smoking in the showers following the defeat at Southampton on New Year’s Day, was on the bench against Stoke, but manager Arsene Wenger is adamant the antics had nothing to do with axing him.

Szczesny believes Wenger wants to rest him even though David Ospina has started the last two games and hasn’t conceded a goal. Wenger refused to reveal who would play against Manchester City.

Peter Crouch has apologised to Nacho Monreal for leaving the defender with a cut head. The Stoke striker, who caught the Spaniard with an elbow, said: ‘It was totally accidental. I have apologised to him, I did catch him with my arm.’
