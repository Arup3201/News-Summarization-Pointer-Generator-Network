An Ohio kindergarten teacher has been suspended for ten days after surveillance video appeared to show her grabbing a six-year-old boy by his neck.

The boy's parents, Anthony and Autumn Nelson, were shocked at the school's response to the footage, which showed their son Ian being lifted off the ground by his shirt collar.

Teacher Barb Williams was put on unpaid leave, but the Nelsons are calling on her to be fired from the school district where she has taught for 14 years.

Shocking: Surveillance footage at Riverdale School in Ohio show's six-year-old Ian Nelson's head being tipped back as his kindergarten teacher appears to lift him off the ground

Grabbed: The footage appears to show Barb Williams holding on to Ian's shoulders as he comes out of a bathroom

Williams is seen on surveillance footage appearing to confront Ian as he comes out of a bathroom at Riverdale School.

Action: Kindergarten teacher Barb Williams has been suspended without pay for ten days

As the little boy walks out of the bathroom, Williams allegedly grabs him and lifts Ian in front of a wall.

The teacher then appears to grab him by the throat, tilting his head back and forcing him off his feet.

In another shot, Williams appears to have grabbed the boy's shirt and used that to lift the terrified boy off the ground.

'We thought it was just a little incident that happened.That's what the school made it sound like. All of a sudden, we get this video today and this is just outrageous,' Mr Nelson said.

The incident came to light when a member of staff at Riverdale Schools in Hancock County reported Wiliams.

Seeing
 the way their child, who was left bruised, had been treated has been upsetting for the Nelsons, 
who were given a copy of the footage by the school on May 7.

 'I 
just started crying. I burst out in tears. I called my mom. I called his
 mom,' Mrs Nelson said. 

She and her husband were shocked by the school's reaction however, and are demanding that Williams be fired.

The unpaid suspension will end just as the school breaks up for the summer vacation.

Terrified: Ian is allegedly lifted off the ground by his neck and put up against a wall

Upsetting: Ian's mother says she cried when she watched the footage, which appears to show her son being grabbed by the throat

'If I were to do that to her, I 
would go to jail,' Mr Nelson told Toledo News Now. 'I don't think she should be teaching 
anymore ...there's no one that 
should ever put their hands on a child.'

Not only will Williams be back at the school after the summer vacation, she will also be teaching Ian's class.

His parents requested that their little boy - or the teacher - be moved, but the school has refused.

'He's
 scared of her, even going to the school next year, even the year after 
he'll still have to see her if she's present in the building. That’s 
probably going to scare him,' Mrs Nelson told Fox.

Her husband added: 'The principal told at that time that 
she's a highly recommended teacher and they are unwilling to transfer 
him to a different class.'

Concerns: Ian's parents, Anthony and Autumn Nelson, are calling for the teacher to be fired

Investigation: Riverdale School has reported the incident to the sheriff's department

Eric Hoffman, the superintendent for the school, apologized to the Nelsons and said: 'We haven't dealt with this much at Riverdale ... This should not happen.'

He added that the school had filed a report with the sheriff's office, Department of Education, and Child Protective Services.
