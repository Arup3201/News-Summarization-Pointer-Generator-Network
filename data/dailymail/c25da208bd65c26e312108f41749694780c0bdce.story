A Spain team spearheaded by Diego Costa recorded the worst defence of a World Cup title in history, and the impending Chelsea striker did little to replicate his La Liga form on the world stage.

The 25-year-old, on the verge of a £32million deal to join Chelsea from Atletico Madrid, failed to register a single shot on target, as Vicente Del Bosque's team self-destructed and were dumped out after two Group B defeats.

The forward isn't alone, though, as Fernando Torres, Romelu Lukaku and Samuel Eto'o haven't hit the target either, which begs the question - will the Chelsea curse hang over Costa's head, too?

Costa, an out-and-out striker, is hardly a disciple of tiki-taka football and never matched the Spain way.

Indeed, he has been carrying a niggle and was gambled by Del Bosque.

And yes, it's ludicrous to condemn a player, who only last season led Atletico to their first La Liga title in 18 years with 27 goals, to failure after less than two World Cup games.

But it is hardly the vote of confidence that long-suffering Chelsea fans need.

They have, after all, been through it with Torres - a player who has become renowned as a £50m flop since moving from Liverpool four years ago.

But in Costa, they look to have found the solution to a problem, should he keep his La Liga form instead of that at the World Cup so far.

In 126 minutes for Spain, Costa had two shots - neither on target - and scored none.

It is a similar story for Torres.

In 68 minutes, the striker had zero shots, zero goals, zero points for the dead rubbers.

The same goes for Belgium's Lukaku in 58 minutes, whose form during his Everton loan spell wasn't present at the Estadio Mineirao on Tuesday.

In fact, the forward didn't even touch the ball in Algeria's box before being substituted at 1-0 down.

Chase: Costa played as an out-and-out striker for Spain but their tiki-taka ways were lost on the forward

Overhead: Costa will look to break the trend of misfiring strikers that Chelsea seem to attract

Switch: Costa is substituted as Fernando Torres comes on, but the Chelsea striker couldn't hit the target

No go: Romelu Lukaku (left) and Samuel Eto'o (right) are yet to score in the World Cup for Belgium or Cameroon

Eto'o, 
sidelined by an unfortunate knee injury, got away one shot against 
Mexico in Cameroon's World Cup opener, only to be denied by the post. He
 was benched for their follow-up 4-0 loss to Croatia.

Costa's limited performances for Spain created a backlash on social media, as Chelsea fans voiced their opinions and worries.

Mourinho
 can only hope the man who opted for Spain over Brazil breaks the trend 
of misfiring strikers that Chelsea attract, and is just what they need 
to challenge for the Premier League title next season.
