A grieving widow has described how her terminally ill husband was failed by the new NHS 111 helpline in the last hours of his life.

Kim Green was trying to get a nurse to administer pain relief to her 53-year-old husband Jonothan, who was dying of prostate cancer.

She said she was on the phone to a female call centre worker for nearly an hour, but the employee was apparently unable to summon any of the local district nurses as they were not answering their phones.

Mrs Green, 36, who has two sons, 
said: ‘The horrible thing is, I should have been sitting next to him 
holding his hand, reassuring him help was on the way, and I couldn’t 
because I was on the phone frantically trying to get somebody to help 
him.

‘It was absolutely awful. I don’t know whether that made his anxiety levels worse or not, but it certainly didn’t help him.’

By chance, Mrs Green spotted a 
district nurse going to a nearby care home for adults with learning 
disabilities. She ran into the street and was able to persuade the nurse
to administer the medication to her husband.

Upsetting: Mrs Green is now left with the feeling that her husband's anxiety levels in his final hours may have worsened because of the stress caused by her unsuccessful attempt to get a nurse to visit

He died hours later last Wednesday at his home in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire.

Mrs Green’s account comes days after 
NHS England, the new body in charge of running the health service, 
launched an urgent review of the 111 helpline.

It has replaced NHS Direct and GP 
out-of-hours numbers and is meant to make it easier for patients to get 
medical advice, especially at evenings and weekends.

But it has struggled to cope with 
high volumes of calls and there have been reports of critically-ill 
patients waiting for as long as 11 hours to speak to a nurse.

Mr Green, who ran a taxi firm with 
his wife, had begun suffering from violent spasms and although Mrs Green
had the necessary medication, it could only be administered via syringe
by a nurse.

A&E departments are braced for a surge of patients over the bank holiday as a result of flaws with 111

Telling Sky News about her ordeal 
with the 111 call centre, she said: ‘Initially they phoned the nursing 
team and they wouldn’t answer their phone. Nobody would answer the 
phone, they couldn’t get hold of anybody.

‘I was on the phone while she [the 
call centre operator] kept coming backwards and forwards, “I’m trying 
this, I’m trying that, I’m trying the other” and she just couldn’t get 
hold of anybody.’

Although Mrs Green does not in any 
way blame NHS 111 for her husband’s death, she believes it could have 
been more peaceful had a nurse come more quickly.

Since the 111 system was introduced 
earlier this year, many hospital A&E units have been overwhelmed 
with patients who have abandoned the helpline or have been given the 
wrong advice.

At least three people have died as a result of flaws in the system, while the real figures are thought to be higher

Nursing leaders say that waiting 
times of 12 hours are now routine and with some units so overcrowded 
that patients are being put on trolleys in cupboards.

This weekend hospitals have been bracing themselves to be even busier than usual.

Many have recruited extra doctors and
nurses to work or have put in place contingency plans which would see 
temporary wards used for additional patients.

Last week figures obtained by Pulse 
magazine revealed that the helpline was investigating 22 incidents 
involving possible poor care, including three deaths.

The 111 system is run by private GP out of hours firms, NHS Direct or ambulance services in different areas of the country.

NHS England has pledged to fine these organisations if they are found to be failing to run the helpline properly.

A spokesman for the NHS 111 service in Buckinghamshire said: ‘This is a very sad case and our sympathy goes out to the family.

‘We take the responsibility for the safety and well-being of our patients extremely seriously.

‘When a concern such as this is 
raised about the NHS 111 service we undertake an incident review 
involving experienced clinical staff. This allows us to identify clear 
actions so that lessons can be learned and acted on quickly and 
thoroughly.

‘We would urge the family to contact us directly so that we can discuss this case further with them.’
