Australian journalist Peter Stefanovic was detained by an armed pro-Russian group during a 'very threatening' 40 minute standoff in Ukraine overnight.

The Nine News reporter and younger brother of Karl Stefanovic said the situation was tense after he and his camera crew were stopped by armed men at the edge of Slovyansk, Ukraine.

Stefanovic, 30, said they were approaching a checkpoint at the rebel-held town when six to 12 armed separatists ordered them off the road.

Threatening standoff: Australian reporter Peter Stefanovic was detained by an armed pro-Russian group in Slovyansk, Ukraine overnight

'A man had a machine gun pointed right at us,' he said during an interview with his brother Karl on the Today Show this morning.

'They told us to get out of the van. They wanted to know who we were, where we came from, what we were doing.'

The European correspondent said the high levels of tension in Ukraine made conditions 'very difficult' to report in.

'They went through our bags. They wanted to take our armour, they didn't in the end but they did take some of our protective equipment,' he said.

'They wanted us to delete our pictures as well.'

Stefanovic said he and his crew were held for about 40 minutes, before being told to 'get out of town'.

'They were talking to us all the while in Russian and talking to us in a very threatening way – our translator had to relay what was going on,' he said.

More than 30 pro-Russian rebels were killed in a military assault in Slovyansk on Monday, amid fresh concerns of civil war.

Ukraine Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said on his Facebook page that four government troops also died and another 20 were injured during the clash.

Stefanovic said well-equipped and well-armed separatists were expecting a full-on assault by the Ukrainian military.

Ukraine is facing its worst crisis in decades as the polarised nation of 46 million tries to decide whether to look toward Europe, as its western regions want to, or improve ties with Russia, which is favoured by the many Russian-speakers in the east.

Stefanovic has been filing stories from Ukraine for several weeks.

He and his team were the only crew to film as pro-Russian separatists seized a television station Donetsk last week.
