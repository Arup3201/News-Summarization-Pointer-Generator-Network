An illegal online market selling hard drugs and fake passports has reopened just six weeks after being shut down by the FBI, it can be revealed today.

Silk Road 2.0 - which can only be accessed through a modified internet browser - sells items such as cocaine, ecstasy, fake utility bills and driving licences using the encrypted digital currency ‘bitcoins’.

The original website, Silk Road, was closed on October 2 by the FBI, who charged Ross Ublricht, 29, known as ‘Dread Pirate Roberts’, in San Francisco with running the site - which he has denied.

On offer: British-based user 'Saint Nic' said he was selling '50x Nintendo Mario Allstars 170mg MDMA Ecstasy' and they would be posted first-class by Royal Mail. The drugs are available for 1.79 bitcoins (£390)

Murky: Silk Road 2.0 - which can only be accessed through a modified internet browser - sells items such as cannabis, ecstasy, fake utility bills and driving licences using the encrypted digital currency 'bitcoins'

Cannabis options: Silk Road became popular with users thanks to its well-designed interface and third-party payment system. There were said to be almost 960,000 registered users with the website

British-based user 'Saint Nic' said he was selling '50x Nintendo Mario Allstars 170mg MDMA Ecstasy' and they would be posted first-class by Royal Mail. The drugs were available for 1.79 bitcoins (£390).

Another item was a fake Lithuanian passport, which the vendor 'ThreeKings' said can be used 'for work, migration to EU country, renting a car or other reasons'. This sells for 7.58 bitcoins (£1,665).

Prices of other lower-cost items include 0.1 bitcoins (£22) for 25 pornographic films, 0.14 bitcoins (£30) for 0.2g of 'high quality uncut cocaine' and 0.01 bitcoins (£2.50) for a Spotify Premium account.

The marketplace - which is effectively a back-alley version of online marketplace Ebay - can only be accessed by downloading a browser which grants users anonymity when surfing online.

Start: Anyone can access the website by creating a profile - not linked to an email account - and are greeted by a note from its new operator, also called Dread Pirate Roberts

Anyone can then access the website by creating a profile - not linked to an email account - and are greeted by a note from its new operator, also called Dread Pirate Roberts.

Part of the message says: ‘It took the FBI two and a half years to do what they did. Divide, conquer and eliminate was their strategy… but four weeks of temporary silence is all they got.

‘And as our resilient community bounces back even stronger than ever before, never forget that they can only ever seize assets - they can never arrest our spirit, our ideas or our passion, unless we let them. We will not let them.’

The message - on the homepage of Silk Road 2.0 - adds that it has ‘implemented a complete security overhaul’ which ‘marks the dawn of a brand new era for hidden services’.

Drugs: Like the new version, the original Silk Road allowed tech-savvy sellers to post adverts for illegal products, which they sold for bitcoins and shipped to customers through standard postal services

Currency: Supporters say bitcoins offer a lower fraud risk and better privacy, but critics argue the anonymity it offers makes it a magnet for drug transactions, money-laundering and other illegal activities

Fashion accessories: Fake Burberry scarves, Ray Ban sunglasses and Gucci belts were on sale on Silk Road

Other items available for purchase on Silk Road 2.0 from various sellers include fake jewellery, clothes and accessories, adult content and hard drives full of music albums and films.

But some commentators have expressed caution at Silk Road 2.0, with one suggesting it could be a scam by law enforcement agencies, set up in order to capture details about those using the website.

Access: Users of the Silk Road marketplace can pay 0.01 bitcoins (£2.50) for a Spotify Premium account

Adult content: Prices of other lower-cost items include 0.1 bitcoins (£22) for 25 pornographic films. Some of the images on this webpage showed full nudity and have been covered up by MailOnline for decency reasons

The value of one bitcoin - a currency not backed by a government or central bank - is currently equivalent to £220 or $350. Therefore, £1 is equivalent to 0.005 bitcoins, and $1 to 0.003 bitcoins.

The currency is now gaining a footing among some businesses and consumers, although it is yet to become an accepted form of payment on the websites of major retailers such as Amazon.

Supporters say bitcoins offer a lower fraud risk and better privacy, but critics argue the anonymity it offers makes it a magnet for drug transactions, money-laundering and other illegal activities.

The charges against Ulbricht said the original Silk Road – launched in February 2011 - generated sales of more than 9.5million bitcoins - equivalent to $3.3billion or £2.1billion at today’s rates.
