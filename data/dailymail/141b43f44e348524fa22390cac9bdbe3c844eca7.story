A jilted air stewardess has admitted smashing a glass into the face of a pilot who ended their love affair by text message.

Senior British Airways cabin crew member Frances Smith, 36, flew into a rage when the divorced pilot ended their 18-month relationship, smashing a wine glass as they were out drinking near Cardiff Airport, a court heard.

She then drove the jagged glass into his face leaving him with a three-inch deep wound to his jaw which needed internal and external stitches.

Divorcee Smith and the pilot were out drinking in a series of nightspots near Cardiff Airport when they began arguing in a bar.

Prosecutor David Pugh said: 'The couple had a disagreement and a verbal argument, which passed.

'There were then text messages between them and he said: "Leave me alone, we're finished".

The court heard Smith, of Horley, Surrey, claimed she had become pregnant twice during the affair - she later told police the pilot had asked to have a termination both times.

The prosecutor said: 'She became intoxicated and emotional. At about 9.30pm they were in the bar and she said to him: "Why didn't you tell your family I'm pregnant?"

'Miss Smith threw her drink into his face and, when he turned to the bar, she struck him with a broken glass to the face.

The pair had been drinking in several bars in Barry, near Cardiff Airport, when they started having a row

'The wound bled profusely and she ran from the premises and was detained by an off-duty police officer.'

Cardiff Crown Court heard Smith later confessed to police saying: 'I did it, I'm really sorry, I've done a stupid thing.'

Smith told officers she had not come to terms with two pregnancy terminations which were allegedly carried out at the pilot's request, but was not pregnant on the night of the assault, during which she and the pilot drank at the Premier Inn, Wetherspoons, and Finnegan's Bar in Barry, south Wales.

Smith admitted wounding and was 
sentenced to a year's imprisonment suspended for two years.  She was 
given a one-year supervision order and told to carry out 150 hours' 
unpaid work.

  'Had that injury been lower, the consequences would have been utterly dreadful.'

   - Judge Tom Crowther, QC

Scottish-born Smith, who had no previous convictions, was also ordered to pay costs of £535 and a victim surcharge of £100.

Tracey Lloyd-Nesling, defending, started to give the court Smith's mitigation but Judge Tom Crowther told her: 'You don't need to, I'm not sending this woman to prison.'

Judge Tom Crowther QC told Smith: 'Had that injury been lower, the consequences would have been utterly dreadful.

'You made early admissions and you have shown remorse.'

After the case, the divorced pilot, who asked not to be named, said: 'This has been a terrible experience which I just want to put behind me.

'I'm still scarred by what went on. I've learned a very bitter lesson.

'It was completely untrue about the pregnancies. This was not a big affair but a work relationship which went on too long.'

A spokesman for British Airways said Smith no longer worked for the airline.
