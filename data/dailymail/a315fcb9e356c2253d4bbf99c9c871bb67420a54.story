A British man who moved to Australia to start a new life has been missing for five days in bitterly cold mountains.

Berkshire-born Gary Tweddle, 23, was attending a technology conference in the Blue Mountains, west of Sydney, when he vanished in the early hours of Tuesday.

His father David Tweddle, an Army officer, has flown to Australia to join the lines of police and emergency service workers scouring the dense bushland, where there are a number of dangerous cliffs.

Police said they feared the missing man could be lying injured in harsh conditions, as darkness began to fall on the fifth day of the search effort.

Mr Tweddle called a friend shortly after midnight on Tuesday and told them he was lost in bushland near a main road after becoming separated from a group.

Nothing was heard from him after that, 
suggesting that he was out of range of a mobile signal or that his phone's 
battery had run flat.

Mr Tweddle, described as being 'extremely fit', appeared to be in good spirits when he made the phone call.

'He's not dressed for these conditions so we need to find him quickly,' police commander Mick Bostock said.

His father has been putting up posters in small towns in the mountains appealing for help in trying to locate his son.

'It's been several days now and obviously there is concern,' said David Tweddle.

'We're all praying for his safe return.'

Bad weather was setting in today, adding to fears for the missing man's well-being.

Police bushland experts along with members of the Rural Fire Service and the State Emergency Service have been searching the dense forests - where there are dangerously steep cliffs - since first light on Tuesday but there has been no sign of the young man.

Friends said that after growing up in Britain, Mr Tweddle moved to Queensland's Gold Coast before moving again to live in Sydney.

His girlfriend, Anika Haigh, has been waiting anxiously at a police command post in the mountains along with Gary's father as the search for the young man continued today.

'We're absolute desperate to bring him home to his very loved family and friends,' Miss Haigh told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation earlier.

The search teams, made up of 75 officers and volunteers, have been scouring bushland around the small town of Leura, risking their own lives among the cliffs and gullies.

Mr Tweddle's family and friends have taken to Facebook to appeal for any information.

'Keep up the prayers that our little Gary is just having a bit of an adventure and is safe and well,' his sister Amy wrote on Facebook.

His brother Craig wrote: 'Stay safe, don't panic. USE YOUR SKILLS'.

Gary, who is 5ft6ins, is of medium build, with brown eyes and short brown hair.

When last seen he was wearing a black jacket, checked shirt and blue jeans.

In July, 2009 - almost four years ago to the day - British backpacker Jamie Neale was found alive after going missing in the Blue Mountains for 12 days.

Aside from the four year separation, only a day's difference stands between Mr Neale's discovery on July 15 and the early hours of July 16 when Mr Tweddle went missing.
