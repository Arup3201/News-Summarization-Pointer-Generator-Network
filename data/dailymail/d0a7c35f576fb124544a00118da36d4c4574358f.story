It is Arsenal versus Manchester United on Saturday evening, a match that has in every season since the Premier League began featured at least one team with genuine title credentials.

Not so this time. Where once, Arsene Wenger and Sir Alex Ferguson knew the result would likely shape the destination of that over-sized silverware, now the clubs are in a modest battle for the final Champions League spot.

Neither side is in the top four currently and you have to trawl back to September 1998 for the last occasion that was the case heading into this fixture.

Both entered the final day of that season capable of lifting the trophy following an epic struggle over many months. United beat Tottenham to edge their rivals by a point and went on to claim the Treble. It seems improbable in the extreme that a similar story could unfold this year.

Before and after that match at Highbury in September 1998, when Arsenal were eighth and United 10th, the fixture was a premium one in the top-flight calendar.

For nine consecutive seasons from 1995-96 to 2003-04, United and Arsenal shared the crown between them, many times finishing one and two in the table.

The matches where they faced off directly would often define each of those seasons. Marc Overmars did for Gary Neville in March 1998 to get Wenger a win that would see his side claw back an 11-point gap on route to the double.

In April 2003 United clinched a 2-2 draw at Highbury from behind that invigorated their charge and had Ferguson running across the pitch to celebrate.

Had Ruud van Nistelrooy converted a last-minute penalty at Old Trafford in September 2003, The Invicibles would never have happened. The reaction from Martin Keown et al following the 0-0 draw painted a picture of its importance.

Fast-forward 13 months and to the 2-0 defeat in Manchester that stopped Arsenal's unbeaten run at 49 games and triggered a food fight in the tunnel which left Ferguson with pizza on his lapel and a Battle of the Buffet nickname coined.

Roy Keane's fury at Patrick Vieira in the Highbury tunnel in February 2005 was fuelled because he was aware of the overall significance of the game.

Chelsea, under Jose Mourinho, would finally end the dominance of the two clubs that season but back then Arsenal versus United was still the fixture to watch.

It was a Clasico for the Premier League, pitching a side from the nation's capital against another from far outside, with all the cultural differences that brings; and two clubs steeped in success.

In Keane's latest autobiography, his index requires 20 separate page references for all mentions of Arsenal, such was their impact on his career.

'Which of us was the better team?' he asks at one point. 'You couldn't call it. We were like two heavyweights battering each other.'

Saturday's bout might push cruiserweight, if you're being generous; an undercard contest when once it was the main event.
