A versatile cushion shaped like a Möbius strip promises to make any situation suitable for taking a nap.

The Forever Pillow's never-ending single surface provides infinite folding possibilities allowing you to sleep in almost any position.

The looped cushion gets its name because of its mathematical shape and makers claim it is so comfortable that it allows you to 'literally nap for eternity'.

Makers recommend using it as a desk pillow, back support, a scarf, eye mask, keyboard rest and more

Whether you're laying down, sitting or even standing, you can wrap and twist the soft, portable pillow around you for comfort.

The Möbius
 infinity concept inspired studio BCXSY for HUZI to create a versatile pillow that can be
 used in endless possible ways when you twist and turn it: The Forever Pillow has a twist that creates a never-ending surface.

Makers of the alternative to the U-shaped travel cushion recommend using the soft furnishing as a desk pillow, back support, a scarf, eye mask, keyboard rest and much more.

The lightweight 'silky smooth' product is made form 100 per cent environmentally friendly, hypoallergenic and antibacterial Bamboo fabric and 3M Thinsulate filling. It claims to keep you cool in the summer and warm in the winter.

Shoppers can choose from six colors: navy, taupe, off white, apricot, grey and orange; but the pillow's not on sale yet. It features as a Kickstarter project and has already surpassed it's goal of raising £6,118. They are just short of reaching £10,000 with 10 days still left to pledge.
