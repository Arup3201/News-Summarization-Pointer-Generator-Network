Grammar pedants have been urged by a minister to rise up against councils who have tried to erase apostrophes from road signs.

Brandon Lewis said that if humanity can put a man on the moon and split the atom it can build a sat-nav which understands proper punctuation.

The local government minister insisted there is ‘no Whitehall rule or Brussels diktat’ forcing town halls to wipe punctuation from the map.

Scholars' Walk in Chesterton where somebody has added the missing apostrophes

Councils in Mid Devon and Cambridge have been criticised for removing apostrophes from street names and road signs.

Locals armed with black marker pens have fought back, with with missing punctuation, such as that at Scholars Walk, having the  correct apostrophe inserted overnight.

On the same sign in the Cambridge’s East Chesterton area, an apostrophe has also been added to Pepys Court.

However, Mr Lewis insisted that if the humble apostrophe is ‘good enough for Her Majesty's Government, so should it be for local councils’.

In a lengthy response to a parliamentary questions, he said there was no Government guidance issued to councils about the use of the apostrophe on street signs.

He said: ‘I understand this may stem from a misunderstanding of guidance issued by the Geoplace National Land and Property Gazetteer which is overseen by local government.

‘However, Geoplace has confirmed it doesn't require councils to remove apostrophes either - councils can continue to use apostrophes and punctuation if they're used in the official street name.

‘One of the spurious reasons for abolishing apostrophes has been the suggestion they may cause confusion for emergency services' IT systems.

‘If mankind can put a man on the moon, split the atom and decode the double helix then I'm sure it's not beyond the reach of 21st Century technology to have a sat-nav which can understand an apostrophe.’

Mr Lewis said he could not support ‘grammar guerillas’ who return missing apostrophes to new signs because it is an offence to deface a street sign under 1907 legislation.

But in a call to arms to grammar fans across the country, he added: ‘We would encourage residents to defend their traditional place names from over zealous municipal pen pushers.’

Banned: Existing apostrophes such as Blundell's Avenue in Devon will not be changed but no new signs will be permitted to use such punctuation

Official guidance: Mid Devon Council said in future all road signs should avoid using punctuation entirely

Mr Lewis said apostrophes should stay on road signs, and satnav systems could cope

Mr Lewis was responding to a question from Conservative MP for South Swindon, Robert Buckland.

Mr Buckland said: ‘I think I join a long queue of people who get upset when they see misuse of this punctuation mark!

‘There is a serious point to be made about how we need to make sure things are spelt correctly - otherwise what is the point in having these rules?’
