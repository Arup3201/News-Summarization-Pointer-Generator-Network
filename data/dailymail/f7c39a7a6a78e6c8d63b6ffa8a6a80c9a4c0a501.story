A Florida congressman has accused his wife of bigamy after almost 24 years of marriage.

U.S. Representative Alan Grayson said in divorce papers filed last week that his wife Lolita was married to another man when she married the congressman in 1990.

Grayson says he was unaware that his wife was still married when they tied the knot.

Alan Grayson, a liberal Democrat from the Orlando, Florida area claims that his wife Lolita (left) is a bigamist who was already married when they tied the knot in 1990

The Democrat says his wife, who was born in the Philippines, secretly divorced her other husband in 1994.

An attorney for Lolita Grayson, Mercedes Wechsler, wouldn't comment on the court papers on Tuesday.

Earlier this year, Lolita Grayson accused her husband of pushing her during a confrontation at their home but sheriff's investigators found no probable cause to charge him.

In March, Lolita Grayson was granted a restraining order against her husband. She alleged that Grayson pushed her against the front door of their home when he stopped by the house.

Grayson's lawyers later released a video showing his estranged wife shoving him in front of their house but doesn't reveal the congressman slamming his wife against a door as she claimed.

The video, shot by a staffer for the congressman, shows Lolita Grayson walking from a red minivan parked in front of their home, pointing her finger and shouting.Â 

The video then cuts to the congressman and his wife arguing at the front door to the house. It then shows Lolita Grayson pushing her hand at her estranged husband's face. Alan Grayson was at the house to visit his children.

The Graysons have five children and the congressman is seeking parental responsibility for the four who are still minors.

Grayson was ranked as the 11th richest person in Congress in 2010, based on financial disclosure forms with a net worth of $31.4million, according to rollcall.com.

His largest asset was a claim against the now-defunct Derivium Capital for at least $25 million. The Florida lawmaker also reported a trust valued at $5 -$25 million with no debts.

In the early Nineties, Grayson founded law firm Grayson & Kubli, which concentrated on government contract law.

He is known as a Democratic firebrand
 in the House of Representatives. Last October his re-election campaign 
emailed a fundraising solicitation that compared the conservative tea 
party to the Ku Klux Klan. A burning cross took the place of the 'T' in 'Tea Party.'
