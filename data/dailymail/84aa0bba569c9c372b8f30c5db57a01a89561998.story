This is the touching moment a North Dakota cross country runner carried a competitor across the finish line after she badly injured her leg.

Melanie Bailey, a senior at Devils Lake High School, was running in the Eastern Dakota Conference’s Cross Country Championship when she spotted Danielle LeNoue lying on the ground sobbing in pain.

Miss LeNoue, a senior at Fargo South High School, had fallen just 800 meters from the finish line after feeling a 'pop' in her left knee, which turned out to be an injury to her patella tendon.

While dozens of runners had sprinted past her, Miss Bailey stopped to help, before lifting her rival on to her back and carrying her over the finish line in an incredible act of compassion.

The pair finished the race eight-and-a-half-minutes after the first-place runner, ABC News reported.

Today, Miss LeNoue described Miss Bailey's actions after she crumpled on the ground with a torn tendon as 'pretty cool, a touching moment for myself'. 

The teenager, who is still recovering from the injury, told Valley News Live: 'I felt like a pop in my knee. I felt like my leg was getting cut off... it was a bad pain. I could not go any further.

'She came and picked me up and put me on her shoulders and away she carried me. She sacrificed her time to some stranger she didn't even know.'

A helping hand: Miss Bailey lifted her rival on to her back (pictured) and carried her over the finish line. The pair finished the race near Glyndon, Minnesota, eight-and-a-half-minutes after the first-place runner

Speaking to WDAY-TV, Miss Bailey said: 'All I could think about was she was in a lot of pain. And I wanted to help her. It's just a race that's the thing. A person is forever, a race just lasts 25 minutes.'

She added that the joint finish at the race at the Ponderosa Golf Course, near Glyndon, Minnesota, on Saturday was a 'great' way to end her cross-country season.

Since the race, Miss Bailey and Miss LeNoue said they have exchanged Facebook messages and become firm friends.
