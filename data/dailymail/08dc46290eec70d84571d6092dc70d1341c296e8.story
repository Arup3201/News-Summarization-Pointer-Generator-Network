Three men have been arrested by the Egyptian army for apparently trying to cut through an undersea Internet cable.

A patrol stopped a fishing boat near the Mediterranean port city of 
Alexandria and arrested three divers, an army spokesman said on his 
official Facebook page.

It is believed they were trying to cut through an SEA-ME-WE 4 undersea cable -  one of the main connections 
between Asia and Europe, running from France to Malaysia and linking 
Italy, north Africa, the middle east and south Asia.

If the men had been successful, experts warned they could have taken an 'entire continent offline', but interruptions were reported around the region, including Dubai and India, today.

The cable targeted, the SEA-ME-WE 4, is 18,800 kilometres long, and is the primary internet 'backbone' between south-east Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Middle East and Europe. It has 17 landing points, pictured above, which are the areas where the cable comes ashore

The men were reportedly just 750metres off the shore of Alexandria when they were caught.

No indication of who the men were or what their motive for cutting the cable was. It is also unclear how much damage was done.

But Sky News reported that there was evidence of slow internet connections as far away as Pakistan and India, according to a network security firm which studies web traffic.

The cable is owned by Telecom Egypt, the biggest web provider in the north African country and slow services were expected to be improved by the end of today.

Operator SEACOM said in the hours that followed the men's arrest that it was confident that full service would be restored quickly.

It added in a statement earlier today: 'We understand from our Egyptian colleagues that the investigation is in its early stages and nothing is as yet confirmed with regard to the cause of the damage to SMW-4'.

The company said that it did not believe that recent damage caused to another cable was caused by sabotage due to its location.

Under the sea lies a multi-billion-dollar network of high-power cables through which 99 per cent of global internet traffic travels.

Submarine cables are expensive to build (generally ranging from $100m - $500m) but they deliver a huge amount of capacity.

Most of the new cables can deliver several terabits (terabit = 1,000 gigabit) of capacity.

Each cable costs about $10m a year in maintenance costs -- the price operators have to pay to keep repair ships on standby, and other costs.  

The cables themselves are often not much wider than garden hoses and contain fibre-optic lines which can each contain bandwidth for up to 20 million people.

One cable between the US and the UK carries 3.2 terabits of data per second - the 7,600 mile journey takes 0.00072 seconds.

Data on newer, hi-tech internet cables is 'flashed' down the lines by high-powered lasers, and the intensity is maintained by electrical repeaters costing up to £1 million each.

An electrical cable runs parallel to the fibre-optic line to power the repeaters.

Failures can be catastrophic. One cable failure - between Sicily and Egypt - left more than 50 per cent of India without power in 2008, sending the country's computer industry and stock markets offline for hours.

Jim Cowie, chief technology officer of US-based Renesys, said a cut cable can cause data to become congested and flow the long way around the world.

The same SEA-ME-WE 4 was seriously damaged back in 2008 by a ship's anchor.

Then, Egyptian web traffic was cut by around 75 per cent until the cable was repaired.

News of the men's arrest comes after a bitter feud between two online companies - a group which aims 
to block unwanted emails known as ‘spam’ and a firm accused of sending 
them - has already been blamed for days of disruption for internet users, in the biggest cyber-attack ever launched.  

Spam-fighting organisation Spamhaus said it has been subjected to a massive cyber-attack, apparently from Dutch company Cyberbunker which it black-listed earlier 
this month.

At its peak, Cyberbunker clogged up 300 gigabits per second of the Internet, it has been reported.

But if the men had been successful in their undersea sabotage attempt, it would have effectively switched off 1.28 terabits — four times as much bandwidth— and with nothing more high-tech than an axe, Quartz.com claims.

It said: 'Most big countries have several redundant cables landing on their shores.

'But the loss of even a single one means that all the traffic must be jammed through remaining connections, causing congestion.

'And there is nothing to stop determined attackers from targeting several cables. Indeed, since many cables go through geographic chokepoints like the Suez, it wouldn’t be difficult to disrupt a whole bunch of connections in a brief period of time.'

In the past week there have been several reports of severed cables off the coast of Egypt that are part of Seacom, a network of cables serving much of Africa.

Business Standard, of India, reports many using Bharti Airtel, Vodafone India, Tata Communications and state-run Bharat Sanhar Nigam Ltd (BSNL) had witnessed disruption or a slower speed during the past few days as a result of the recent fibre optic cable breaks off the Egyption coast, close to Alexandria.

It reports the fibre optics which were cut include Europe India Gateway (EIG), Telecom Egypt North (TEN), South East Asia–Middle East–Western Europe 4 (SMEWE4), India-Middle East-Western Europe (IMEWE).

It had been thought that ships had accidentally caught the cables, but there are now concerns there could be a concerted effort to take down
 Egypt’s connectivity, although it has not been confirmed whether the 
incidents are connected.

Cyberbunker, is based at an ex-Nato bunker, is what is known as a hosting company, meaning it allows organisations to make their websites accessible on the internet by providing space on a server

SEACOM did not give any explanation for the cuts it said hit its cables and other network systems funneling telecoms traffic backwards and forwards in the early hours of Friday.

Web users have reported slower connections across Egypt since then.

The firm, which carries traffic for other companies, said yesterday that services had been restored only to report hours later another connection had been cut.
