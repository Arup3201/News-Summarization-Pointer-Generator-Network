A kind-hearted London cabbie has reunited a couple with treasured holiday photos after they left their camera on his back seat.

One million people saw black cab driver Roshan Varma's internet appeal to find the Aussies after they flew home on Sunday evening.

His search for the couple was shared widely on social media and Peter Fox and his wife Su Harris, who had travelled to London, New York and Europe to celebrate her 40th birthday, were found.

Kind-hearted: Black cabbie Roshan Varma managed to track down the Australian couple who left their camera in his taxi

Mr Varma, 45, picked up the couple on Sunday evening from The Shard, and quickly struck up a conversation with them. He dropped them at London Paddington station where they caught the Heathrow Express to the airport.

But when the cabbie picked up his next customers, they pointed out there was an expensive camera on the back seat. He contacted Australian airline Qantas and Heathrow Airport, but feared he would never be able to track them down. 

'I picked up this Australian couple at The Shard in London and took them to Paddington to catch the Heathrow Express,' Mr Varma said.

'We were chatting away, they were a lovely couple, nice young decent couple and off I went and I thought that was the end of it -  until I picked up another customer and they said "oh someone has left a black carry case in the back of the cab with a camera in it".

'I tried Qantas but they didn’t get back to me and I contacted Heathrow. And then another cabbie told me to contact Lostbox.'

Yesterday, Mr Varma contacted lost and found site Lostbox and in less than five hours his message had been seen by one million people.

Today, Mr Fox contacted the site to say it was the camera he and his wife had left behind.

'And then it was shared and the next thing I know we’ve found the guy,' the taxi driver added. 'We get a bit of bad press at the moment but it’s nice to show London cabbies go the extra mile.

'The camera is an expensive bit of kit, I didn’t go through all the pictures but these are obviously happy memories from their time going round the world.'

Mr Fox told MailOnline: 'We are blown away by the efforts the cab driver took to track us down. The kindness of Roshan the taxi driver and all the people who liked and forwarded on the post has just blown us away'

The Aussie added: 'This positive social media experience has now turned a disaster into one of the most memorable holiday experiences'

Internet appeal: Mr Varma contacted the website Lostbox on Thursday and in less than five hours his message had been seen by one million people

'A cab friend of mine, Mike, has said his daughter is flying over to Australia later this month and she could reunite it then.'

Mr Fox told MailOnline: 'We are blown away by the efforts the cab driver took to track us down. 

'He was friendly and kind which is why we were chatting to him, which probably helped tracking us down given he knew we are from Sydney, Australia. 

'The kindness of Roshan the taxi driver and all the people who liked and forwarded on the post has just blown us away.

'The reason we were on holidays to New York City, Europe and London was to celebrate Su's 40th birthday, so to have the photos of our trip found is so wonderful to enable us to preserve memories of such a great holiday.'

 

On Friday, Mr Fox contacted the lost and found site to say it was the camera he and his wife had left behind

He added: 'This positive social media experience has now turned a disaster into one of the most memorable holiday experiences.' 

Clare Owen, director of Lostbox, said that in a matter of hours from Mr Varma getting in touch, more than 3,714 comments were posted, 'tagging' people in Australia.

She said: 'We were contacted yesterday afternoon by Roshan on Twitter.

'We shared the story to our website and from there to Twitter and Facebook. It was shared thousands of times on Twitter but tens of thousands on Facebook.

'We knew this was going to be a big one because in the first hour it reached 30,000 people and then last night after 25,600 shares, Peter Fox got in touch from Australia to say it was his camera.

'He verified the type of camera it was which we hadn’t disclosed.'
