Simon Cowell and love Lauren Silverman have officially decided to call their baby son Simon Cowell Jnr, MailOnline can reveal.

The X Factor supremo, 54, and his girlfriend are expecting their son next month and he will be born in New York so Lauren can be near her eldest son, Adam.

And although many thought Cowell was joking when he said that Simon was his favourite name, a friend of the couple said: ‘Simon and Lauren have decided that their favorite name for the baby is actually Simon.'

‘For a while it was between Simon and Eric- Simon’s dad’s name, but now it looks like Eric will be the middle name.’

Indeed, at Lauren’s baby shower last month, guests brought baby gifts emblazoned with the name Simon on them. Including gifts embroidered with the initials SC.

'There were baby clothes and little games all personalized with the name ‘Simon’', a source said

Cowell's
 Beverly Hills mansion was decked out in blue and white and a 
muscle-bound male server gave out drinks ; and a stunning floral 
arrangement was composed using white orchids, yellow orchids, blue 
hydrangeas and white roses. After the party the flowers were given to 
the nearby Cedars Sinai hospital in Los Angeles. 

Cowell and Lauren, 36, are currently on vacation aboard the Silverstream yacht in St Barts.But it will definitely be all hands on deck when the couple return to Manhattan ahead of their baby’s birth at one of the city’s most exclusive hospitals on February 28.

The couple will bring their son home to the $26-000-a-month apartment they are renting in Manhattan.

Cowell said that Simon was his favourite name while being interviewed by his former girlfriend Terri Semour for Extra last month.

The expectant father said: 'My number one choice is Simon because I like the name.'

He revealed that his second favourite for his first child with girlfriend Lauren Silverman is Eric, after his father, who passed away in 1999.

The music millionaire said: ‘His birthday is going to be very close to my dad’s birthday,' adding that his father would be proud and amazed if he were here.

The X Factor judge said he would like to adopt the same parenting style with which he was raised.

'Be cool about it, and don’t worry 
about things to much… the way my brother and I were brought up, it was 
kind of relaxed. There were no self-help books.'

Cowell
 went on to say that he was looking forward to having his son follow in 
his footsteps, and would like to teach him how to run the business.

As fatherhood draws near, the star knows he'll at least be great at handing out advice.

'I’m
 not brilliant with babies,' he told Parade. 'I never know what to do. 
But [once he’s older] I think I’ll be a good dad in terms of advice.

'And
 then I’ll get to do all the things I want to do, like go to Disneyland 
or Universal Studios, teach him how to drive - I love all that.'

Lauren already has a seven-year-old son Adam with her ex-husband, millionaire property developer Andrew Silverman.

She was said to be keen to have the baby in New York so she is near to Adam.

But
 the couple will be on the go as they will likely take the tot – who 
will have dual nationality – back to the UK to Cowell’s  Holland Park 
mansion soon after his birth as Cowell will start filming TV hit 
Britain’s Got Talent and will be based in the UK for weeks.

Close enough? Lauren patted her man's chest protectively as they walked down the beach

Such bliss: The pair took a romantic stroll and walked arm-in-arm

What's the gossip? Something was making the pair chuckle as they enjoyed their time together

And the pair practiced for parenthood as they strolled the beaches of Barbados last month and Cowell looked comfortable as he held tight to a little blonde child, smiling as he bonded with the baby.

Dressed
 in a strapless black bathing suit with a black sarong, Lauren - who 
seemed thrilled her boyfriend was so into the tot - showed pregnancy 
isn’t affecting her style. 

The besotted couple held hands and linked arms on their stroll as they enjoyed a relaxing Christmas vacation. 

And
 it's all change for Cowell, who recently revealed he will be giving up 
his cigarettes and not smoke in front of his son, after he was 
criticised for puffing away near his pregnant girlfriend.

'I
 won't do that,' he told LBC 97.3. 'I've learnt that. I'm trying to 
do electronic cigarettes, they're not bad. But moderation would be 
better.'
