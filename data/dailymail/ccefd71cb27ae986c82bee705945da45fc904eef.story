An Australian man who was searching for his laptop in a rubbish skip found himself in a terrifying tight squeeze today when he was tipped into the back of a dustbin lorry.

The man, who has not been named, was trying to retrieve his computer from the skip in Perth, Australia, at 4.30am.

His escape was described by one rescue worker as a 'miracle' after his screams of terror were heard by the lorry driver above the sound of the vehicle's engine - just as he was about to start the even noisier crushing mechanism.

But because of the steep sides inside the lorry, the man was unable to climb out and the fire brigade had to be called to rescue him with a ladder.

The man told his rescuers that he had climbed into the rubbish skip to look for his laptop computer, which he had believed was in there.

His explanation baffled his rescuers because the incident had occurred at 4.30 in the morning.

While he was in the skip, he said, he realised it was suddenly being lifted up and he, along with piles of rubbish, was dumped into the rear of the compactor truck.

Police said later that on investigating screams, the driver found the distressed man among waste that was due to be crushed.

A fire brigade spokesman confirmed that the man had escaped uninjured.

But his rescuers agreed that psychologically he had received a terrifying blow he would never want repeated.
