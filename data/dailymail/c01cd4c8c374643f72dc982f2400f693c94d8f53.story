Facebook paid no corporation tax in Britain last year despite raking in more than £200million from its UK operations, documents reveal.

It means the internet giant has paid just £1million in corporation tax on the half a billion pounds of revenue it has made since arriving in Britain in 2007.

Furious MPs last night accused the social media company of ‘deliberately manipulating’ its accounts – and demanded tougher action on tax avoidance by big multinationals.

Revenues: Social networking site Facebook, founded by Mark Zuckerberg, claims to have made a loss last year despite generating an estimated £223million in revenues from Britain

Facebook makes money from selling adverts targeted at its users based on their personal preferences.

In a practice that is legal but has been branded ‘immoral’ by MPs, the social networking company records most of its UK sales in Ireland. Like other US technology firms such as Google, it bills its UK arm simply as a service and marketing division.

During 2012 the company’s UK division states it made a pre-tax loss of £2.4million on sales of £34.6million – which meant it incurred no tax bill. But according to some analysts the true sales figure from its UK operations would be closer to £223million, the majority of which will have been registered to its Irish division.

Margaret Hodge, chairman of the Public Accounts Committee which has investigated Google and Amazon over tax avoidance, said: ‘This is yet another example of what appears to be deliberate manipulation of accounts of economic activity to deprive the British taxpayer of a rightful tax contribution, according to the profits they make in the UK. I am getting fed up of this constant stream of stories and little sign of a challenge from HM Revenue & Customs and a strange silence from Government.’

This figure could be higher than £300million during 2013.

France is pushing for Europe to adopt a new corporation tax regime which would see multinationals such as Google and Facebook taxed in the countries where customers use their websites.

A Facebook spokesman said: ‘Facebook pays all taxes required by UK law and we comply with tax laws in all countries where we operate.

'We take our tax obligations seriously, and work closely with national tax authorities around the world to ensure compliance with local law.’

Tax accountant Richard Murphy said: ‘This company is avoiding tax, plain and simple. If its income was recorded in the UK, as it should be, then it should end up paying tax.’
