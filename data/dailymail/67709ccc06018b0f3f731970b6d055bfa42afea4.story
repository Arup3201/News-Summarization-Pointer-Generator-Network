Confession: Labour MP Tristram Hunt has admitted he might send his three children to private schools

Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt has admitted he might send his children to private schools.

The Labour MP has a five-year-old son, Digby, who goes to a primary school in London.

He also has two younger daughters who he suggested could go to the same school.

But asked if he would pay for them to attend independent schools, he said: ‘As a parent you can never rule out whatever takes place but we are delighted with the education he’s [Digby’s] having.’ 

The TV historian turned MP, the son of Lord Hunt of Chesterton, benefited from a public school education himself.

He was educated at £15,465-a-year University College School in Hampstead, north London.

It is part of the Eton Group, which comprises 12 of the most elite independent schools in the country.

And he would not be the first Labour MP whose commitment to the Party’s philosophy of equality and egalitarianism is open to question when it comes to educating their children.

Tony Blair and Harriet Harman both send their children to the selective London Oratory School.

And ardent Left-winger Diane Abbott - who had criticised the way her colleagues educated their children - enrolled her son, James, at the prestigious private City of London School.

Details emerged in 2003, a month after she spoke out about the public deserving ‘education on the basis of merit, not ability to pay’.

Tory MP Peter Bone yesterday said Labour MPs had a tendency to ‘say one thing and do another’.

He added: ‘I think he [Hunt] should send his children to the best school for them - if that’s a private school that’s absolutely the right thing to do.

‘But then it’s a little worrying when they lecture us about where to send our children to school.’ 

Barnaby Lenon, the chairman of the Independent Schools Council, said: ‘We’re delighted that the shadow secretary for education is thinking of sending his children to an independent school.’

Mr Hunt’s comment, in the Daily Mirror, raises the prospect of his children being taught by unqualified teachers - despite Labour’s policy that full-time teachers in state-funded schools must be fully qualified.

He said: ‘We are not going to come in and sack teachers but we are going to say they have to work towards qualified teacher status or they have to go.’ 

He also suggested Labour could bring back Education Maintenance Allowances for 16-18-year-olds, which were cancelled in England by the Coalition amid claims they were being used as ‘beer money’.

Their reinstatement could be paid for by axing wealthy pensioners of the winter fuel allowance.

The 39-year-old, who studied history at Trinity College, Cambridge, presented several television documentaries and wrote a number of books before being elected as the MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central in 2010.

But he slipped up when asked the date of the Battle of Crecy, where Edward III defeated the French.

He suggested 1419 but admitted he was ‘probably wildly out’. The actual date was 1346.
