British nurse William Pooley who survived Ebola, has described the new Band Aid charity single as 'cringeworthy'

The British nurse who survived Ebola has described the new Band Aid 30 charity single as 'culturally ignorant and cringeworthy'.

William Pooley - who went back to work at an isolation unit in Sierra Leone in West Africa, just weeks after he was airlifted to London for treatment - described the lyrics as 'a bit much'.

His comments come after pop star Emeli Sande, who featured in Band Aid 30, said the song needed rewriting and celebrities, MPs and charities have joined a backlash against it, claiming it 'patronises' Africa. 

Pooley criticised the lyrics in the reworked version of Do They Know It's Christmas? featuring One Direction, Bono and Ed Sheeran and put together by Bob Geldof.

'On the way into work I heard the first half of it. It's definitely being talked about here among my colleagues,' he told Radio Times magazine.

'But stuff about Do They Know It's Christmas? - it's just like, actually people live normal lives here and do normal things.

'It's Africa, not another planet. That sort of cultural ignorance is a bit cringeworthy. There's a lyric about 'death in every tear'. It's just a bit much.'

Asked if he had a message for people back in Britain, he said: 'I would say that it's a good idea to read as much as you can about what's going on in West Africa, and if you feel so inclined then donate some money to one of the charities, like King's, that are working out here, directly caring for Ebola patients.'

It has faced a barrage of criticism from those who say the lyrics are outdated and perpetuate negative stereotypes of African countries. 

Emeli Sande, who featured in Band Aid 30, said the song needed rewriting.

She apologised 'if the lyrics of the song have caused offence' and said that new lyrics she and African artist Angelique Kidjo recorded did not make the final version.

Lily Allen also said  she refused to take part in the project because she felt there was 'something smug about it'.

She added: 'I prefer to do my charitable bit by donating actual money and not being lumped in with a bunch of people like that.'

Meanwhile British-Ghanaian rapper Fuse ODG revealed he pulled out of the project because he disagreed with the lyrics, which have been revised since the first Band Aid track in 1984.

Writing on Twitter, the 26-year-old said he felt the message of the song was ‘not in line’ with his own thoughts on how to help Africa. Sir Bob supported his decision, adding: ‘He said he just felt awkward’.

But the Boomtown Rats star, 63, responded furiously to his other critics. Appearing on Sky News he said their concerns were a ‘complete load of b*******’.

The new recording - which became the fastest selling single of the year - marks the 30th anniversary of the song, which was originally put together to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia.

Liberian academic Robtel Pailey, 32, who studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, has previously labelled the lyrics are ‘incredibly patronising and problematic’.

She told Radio 4’s Today programme:‘It paints the continent as unchanging and frozen in time. If you look at the revised lyrics, there are references to ‘them’ versus ‘us’.

‘And the fact of the matter is, if you look at countries that have been most affected by Ebola, the vast majority of the population in Sierra Leone is Muslim, the vast majority of the population in Guinea is Muslim. Yes, we know it is Christmas, but not all of us celebrate Christmas.’

When it was first released in 1984, the Do They Know It’s Christmas? came under fire for perceived inaccuracies and offensive lyrics.

At the time, the line ‘There won’t be snow in Africa’ was criticised by those who pointed out there is snow in some parts of the continent.

U2 singer Bono – who also recorded the latest version – later admitted he ‘loathed’ another line which said: ‘Well tonight thank God it’s them instead of you.’

This year, it was replaced with the words ‘Well tonight we’re reaching out and touching you’, while the line ‘Where the only water flowing is the bitter sting of tears’ was replaced with ‘Where a kiss of love can kill you and there’s death in every tear.’

Mr Pooley, from Eyke in Suffolk, became the first confirmed Briton to contract Ebola and was flown back to the UK in August.

He was treated with the experimental drug ZMapp and left hospital in September after making a full recovery.

The nurse said that money coming in from governments was 'filtering through at a glacial pace'.

'Governments pledged money months ago... I don't know whether it's working. I'm sure it's better to donate than not, but it's just a shame it gets tied up in lots of bureaucracy,' he said.

He added: 'There are still people outside the front of the hospital dying of Ebola because there aren't enough beds for them. I had hoped that by now that would have been over.'

Mr Pooley, who will be celebrating Christmas with a meal 'and a few beers' after his shift ends at Freetown's Connaught Hospital, dismissed the idea that he was a hero.

'I'm working with masses of local staff who are risking death,' he said.

'The big problem at the moment is they haven't been paid for months -which sounds bad enough to English ears, but in Sierra Leone if you're not getting paid, then you're facing starvation. But they're still coming to work. They are the heroes.'
