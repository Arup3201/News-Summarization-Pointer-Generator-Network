Steve McClaren will resist any attempts to prise him away from Derby County and is committed to the task of getting the club promoted next season.

Southampton are reported to be considering an approach for the Derby head coach after Mauricio Pochettino left for Tottenham and took his backroom staff with him.

But McClaren is happy at the iPro Stadium and focussed on the summer transfer window with preparations underway for the coming campaign following play-off heartbreak.

Gut-wrenching: Steve McClaren's Derby were undone by an injury-time winner from Bobby Zamora

Commitment: McClaren says he wants to stay with Derby

Derby came agonisingly close to promotion but were undone by Bobby Zamora’s late strike for Queens Park Rangers at Wembley.

McClaren has forged a strong relationship with his squad and supporters after replacing Nigel Clough last September and has serious ambitions for automatic promotion next year.

The interest from Southampton is understandable given the way in which McClaren solidified his reputation for innovative coaching and trusting in youth last season - matching the blueprint at St Mary's.

But the job at Derby is very much unfinished and the 53-year-old, alongside assistants Paul Simpson and Eric Steele,  wants to be the one to complete it. He has two years left on his contract.

George Thorne, the 21-year-old on loan from West Bromwich Albion who shone in the play-off final, is the club’s prime transfer target.

Brought in at the end of January he quickly became a vital player but his performances might have convinced West Brom to retain his services or alerted other Premier League sides to his ability.
