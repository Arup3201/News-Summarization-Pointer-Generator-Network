Apprentice boss Lord Sugar has been accused of bullying behaviour after calling a plus-size model 'fatty' on Twitter.

The multi-million pound business tycoon, 67, became embroiled in a Twitter row after sending the 'cruel' message to beauty queen Elena Raouna, 23.

The row unfolded after she sent him a cheeky message on Sunday night, which said: 'Evening sugar ;-) can I call you that? Lol.'

He replied: 'yes no problem as long as I can call you fatty,' which sparked outrage from some her 2,800 followers who branded him 'a bully', 'arrogant' and a 'miserable old goat'.

Miss Raouna, who won Miss British Beauty Curve in 2013, is now demanding an apology from the no-nonsense TV personality, who made his name founding British electronics company Amstrad.

Miss Raouna had messaged the multi-million pound business tycoon because she was a 'massive fan'. She is now demanding an apology from the Amstrad founder, and has received support from fellow Twitter users

Lord Sugar replied to Miss Raouna's tweet asking if she can 'call him sugar', by saying: 'Yes no problem, as long as I can call you fatty.' He received a wave of abuse for the 'cruel', 'disgusting' Twitter message (above)

She said she was 'absolutely fuming' at his 'cruel' tweet and said she had only sent him a message to get his attention because she was a 'massive fan' of BBC's The Apprentice.

His reply was seen by his 3.8million followers, retweeted more than 1,400 times and favourited by 900 Twitter uses.

Miss Raouna, from Doncaster, said: 'The worst thing about it is I was actually a fan and all I wanted was a simple hello.

'I kind of got excited when I saw his name come up in my newsfeed until I read the end of the tweet.

'I think it’s just really rude and disrespectful, there’s no need to respond with that kind of attitude, and the fact that he can’t even apologise. And why block me? I didn’t do anything wrong.

'I just would really like it if he said sorry. He’s not just offended me, but a lot of plus sized people all over Britain.

'I never got personal with him, I just wanted a friendly tweet.'

She said she is a size 16 – the average size for a woman in Britain – and claimed the tweet was an insult to all women, not just her.

She added to the Mirror: 'I'm still absolutely fuming. It was so cruel.

'I can see people joking about it online and it's as if he's sent out a message to his followers saying it's ok to call people fat.

'It was just a friendly tweet to say 'hi' but my face froze in shock with his reply and I had to check it was his official Twitter page because I couldn't believe he would be so abusive.

'It's cyber bullying.'

The Apprentice star later told a follower who waded into the row to 'get stuffed and mind your own business'

Miss Raouna, a size 16 plus-size model, said she originally wrote to Lord Sugar on Twitter to get his attention because she was a 'massive fan'. However, she is now demanding an apology from the wealthy businessman

Writing on Twitter, she said: 'A light hearted commented to get someone's attention who you are a big fan of for a simple hello did by no means deserve the response I got.

'Over 1300 retweeted and almost 900 favourites #LordSugar s***** comment. That Lord is representing it's ok to call people Fat anywhere! Tut. (sic)

'Sugar doesn't deserve to have the title Lord in front of his name after his childish immature rude choice of message. And no apology!

'Who would want that kind of man as your child's role model? Terrible...'

Many Twitter users also took offence to Lord Sugar's tweet, with one branding it 'disgusting'.

Imogen Grace King said: 'Just seen what @Lord_Sugar tweeted @ElenaRaouna and a hell of a lot of respect has been lost for him. Disgusting.'

@BenDPB wrote: 'I am a big Lord Sugar fan but his comment was awful. You are a beautiful natural woman.'

And Rachel Clark told Miss Raouna: 'I'm so sorry 4 what Alan Sugar said 2 u,digusting&unprovoked, I only hope u don't have 2 deal w things like that everyday.xx'

As the row grew on Twitter, Miss Raouna said to her followers: 'Less than 24 hours and I hope a certain someone is now eating his words. Rude. Arrogant. Horrible person.'

Miss Raouna took on modelling full-time after giving up her job at her parents’ fish and chip shop in South Yorkshire. She won Miss British Beauty Curve in 2013 and now describes herself as a model and public figure

The size 16 model branded Lord Sugar's comments 'childish, immature and rude' and demanded an apology

In a series of tweets, Miss Raouna, from Doncaster, condemned Lord Sugar's behaviour and his 'bullying'

Miss Raouna took on modelling full-time after giving up her job at her parents’ fish and chip shop in South Yorkshire.

She won Miss Britain Curve 2013 – a beauty pageant for women of all sizes – and vowed at the time to use her position to let other voluptuous women know that 'you don't have to be size zero to be a model, and you can be pretty and plus size at the same time'.

The former nail technician student, who was born in Doncaster and is part Cypriot, has since gone on to appear on Channel 4’s Coach Trip and Catchphrase.

Last year, she told MailOnline: 'To go from the chippy to the catwalk is a strange way to do it, but I'm so glad that I entered and the win came as a total surprise.

'My confidence has grown over the years and hopefully I can inspire other plus- size girls to be confident in their own skin.

'I wanted to show that you don't have to be a stick thin model to take part in a beauty contest.'

The model, who describes herself as a ‘public figure’ on Twitter, also revealed how she once applied to appear on The Apprentice but failed to turn up to the audition after being given a place on C4’s Coach Trip.

Representatives acting on behalf of Lord Sugar declined to comment when contacted by MailOnline.
