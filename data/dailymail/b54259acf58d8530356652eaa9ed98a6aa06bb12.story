Wolves star Bakary Sako is aiming to shine in his 100th game for the Championship club this weekend in his customised crystal boots.

The 26-year-old has had bespoke boots made with the club’s colours and wolf symbol to mark the special occasion.

The sparkling footwear is covered in Swarovski crystal, raising the question of whether Sako will be played at the tip of a midfield diamond for Wolves against Brentford on Saturday.

Sako is clearly excited to reach the landmark for Wolves, posting a picture of the eye-catching boots on Instagram.

He added the caption: ’I will be playin my 100 games for Wolves this weekend so a special day deserve a special boots  Big Thanks to @orravan_design the best handmade #football #fit #swarovski #boots #100 #nike #picoftheday #photooftheday #wolves #best.’

Sako has been a real gem since signing for Wolves in 2012, scoring 30 times in his 99 matches and being an integral part of the side who won League One last season.

And he will hope his boots will inspire Kenny Jackett's side to a victory at the weekend following three straight Championship defeats.
