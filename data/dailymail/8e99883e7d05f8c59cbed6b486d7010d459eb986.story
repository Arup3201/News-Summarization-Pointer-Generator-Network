Twenty-five German factory workers have been hospitalised after eating sandwiches laced with rat poison.

So far none of the victims has shown symptoms of illness but they are being kept under observation as a precautionary measure.

A box of filled sandwiches were left on the doorstep of Mueller-Technik, a car parts company in the north-western town of Steinfeld, Lower Saxony, on Tuesday morning.

Employees helped themselves to the sandwiches, filled with cheese and sausage, before one of the workers noticed a strange substance on them.

Emergency services were called and anyone who had eaten a sandwich was taken to hospital.

A Berlin laboratory confirmed overnight that the food had been sprinkled with rat poison.

Police spokesman Frank Soika said the employees had not thought the gesture unusual as it was apparently quite common for workers to buy sandwiches for each other.

'We don't believe the amount of poison used would have been deadly, but it could have caused serious illness,' he said.

Police have interviewed some of the affected workers, but as yet have no indication of who left the sandwiches or why.

Helmut Kohake, managing director of Mueller-Technik, told a press conference yesterday there had been no problems with staff, and no one had been made redundant.

He added that his employees were upset by the incident: 'You don't know whether something like this will happen again.'

Mueller-Technik, founded in 1984, makes plastic parts for use in cars, and had around 240 employees.
