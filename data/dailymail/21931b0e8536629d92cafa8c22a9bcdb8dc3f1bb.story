A petition has been launched to save the Natural History Museum's adored diplodocus skeleton following an announcement it is to be pulled from the museum's great entrance hall and replaced with a blue whale.

It was revealed yesterday museum bosses are to replace it because it was no longer considered relevant, while its replacement blue whale would act as a reminder of 'our responsibility to the planet'.

But the decision has backfired, with the 110-year-old diplodocus - affectionately known as Dippy - now the focus of a vociferous campaign calling for it to remain where it has enthralled millions for the past 110 years.

Affectionately known as Dippy, it was unveiled at a special ceremony at the museum at 1pm on May 12, 1905

Dippy's replacement is to be a blue whale skeleton, previously the centrepiece of the Mammal Hall, and a resident of the museum since 1891. Pictured is an artist's illustration of what it will look like

The campaign, aptly titled 'Save Dippy', has so far gathered more than 14,000 signatures.

The online petition states Dippy is 'loved around the world and is a monument of British heritage. Replacing Dippy with a blue whale skeleton would threaten this and lead to many unhappy faces.

'He has inspired generations of schoolchildren to look back to the earth's past and help them think about looking after the planet's future.' 

Furthermore, it demanded 'Dippy is saved and remains in the main hall forever'.

The change is part of a 'decade of transformation' planned at the museum by its director, Sir Michael Dixon.

Dippy is a fake - one of 10 replicas around the world based on the near-complete skeleton of a real Diplodocus unearthed in Wyoming, US, in 1898 and housed at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh.

If the change goes ahead as planned, from summer 2017, it will be replaced with the 83ft long real skeleton of a blue whale, suspended in a diving motion from the ceiling of the central Hintze Hall.

The whale, previously the centrepiece of the Mammal Hall, and a resident of the museum since 1891, is a symbol of environmental destruction and hope, Sir Michael said.

The biggest animal ever to have lived on Earth at 160 tonnes, it was hunted to near extinction for its oil, meat and body parts.

It is still endangered but its population has recovered ten-fold after being granted protected status in 1967.

Sir Michael said: 'The story of the blue whale reminds us of the scale of our responsibility to the planet.

Our purpose is to challenge the way people think about the natural world, and that goal has never been more urgent.'

Dippy, however, won't be left in pieces in a dusty cupboard.

There are plans to send the model on a tour of the UK. 'Dippy's an icon of the museum but the new exhibit will allow us to tell a range of stories,' Sir Michael said.

The museum recently unveiled a stegosaurus exhibit which, unlike the diplodocus, is made of real fossils.

Sophie the stegosaurus is the most complete dinosaur to go on display at the museum for over a century, and the most complete stegosaurus specimen in the world.

The Natural History Museum holds over 80million specimens, including mammoth skeletons and items from the voyages of Charles Darwin and Captain James Cook.

The museum has a moon rock brought back from the Apollo 17 mission, the only piece in the UK.

It keeps a 900-strong colony of tiny flesh-eating beetles, which it uses to strip carcasses down to skeletons for study or display.

The most valued fossil in the museum's collection is the archaeopteryx, or the 'first bird', which is 150million years old.

This sperm whale skeleton stood in the central hall between 1882 and 1901. The whale was found near Thurso, Scotland, in 1863, and two years later its skeleton was presented to the Museum by Captain D. Macdonald
