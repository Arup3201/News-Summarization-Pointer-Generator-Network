Samuel Amin, 18, went missing at 2am on Saturday after leaving a bar next to the River Avon in Bath, Somerset

Fears were mounting yesterday that a teenager who vanished on a night out may have drowned in a notorious stretch of river - the sixth in five years.

Samuel Amin, 18, went missing at 2am on Saturday after leaving a bar next to the River Avon in Bath, Somerset.

Five people have drowned in the river since 2009 and there have been calls for increased safety measures.

Samuel is described as being of Asian appearance, 5ft 7ins tall, of slim build with black short hair.

He was wearing blue jeans and a red and black lumber-style jacket when he was last seen leaving OPA bar.

Avon and Somerset Police has not begun searching the river but are still looking for the teenager.

A spokesman said: 'If you see Samuel or know where he is, please call our 24-hour Police Enquiry Centre on 101 and quote reference MP2338/14.'

Two people have already drowned this year after falling into the river - which runs right through the city centre - on nights out.

In January Christopher Taylor, 21, drowned despite desperate attempts from the emergency services who raced to the scene.

Then in April the body of Donovan Weale, 42, was pulled out of the water but he was pronounced dead at the Royal United Hospital in Bath.

Other deaths in the river include Kharunigan Jayanatham in 2009, graphic designer Casper Flagg also in 2009, and Bath Spa University student James Bubear in 2011.

All of the men had been returning from nights out when they went missing, apart from Kharunigan Jayanatham who lost his footing while on the phone and fell into the river.

Last year, a 930-yard stretch of fencing was put up along the towpath between Windsor Bridge and Victoria Bridge to improve safety.

Calls were again made at the start of this year though to further improve safety following the most recent deaths.

Three years ago, a Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents report made a series of recommendations to make the waterways safer, such as better highlighting ladders or placing signs dissuading people from walking along a towpath when drunk.
