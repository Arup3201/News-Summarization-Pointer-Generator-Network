Yorkshire's Drax coal power station: Ozone pollution is often produced by combustion in cars and coal-fired power stations. The chemicals that cause ground-level ozone can travel between continents

Man-made air pollution from north America causes Europe to lose 1.2 million tonnes of wheat a year, a new study has found.

Ozone pollution - produced by coal fired power stations and cars - travels between continents much more easily than thought, traveling thousands of miles on the wind.

Crops on every continent are damaged by pollution from others.

The wheat loss in Europe is the biggest worldwide.

The chemical - a powerful air pollutant - is produced when pollutants near the ground react with sunlight.

The researchers say that the pollution could even endanger the security of the food supply in future.

Ozone pollution in all of the northern hemisphere's major industrialised regions - Europe, America and southeast Asia - harms major crops such as wheat, maize, soy, cotton, potato and rice on other continents.

The scale of the impact has previously been unknown.

Ground-level ozone pollution is
produced from chemicals released during 
high temperature combustion, for example by combustion of fossil fuels 
by motor vehicles and in coal fired power plants.

It's separate from the ozone layer, a protective layer around the outside of our atmosphere. Ground-level ozone is harmful to humans as well as plants.

The study also suggests that increasing 
levels of air pollution from one continent may partly offset efforts on another.

The findings have important implications 
for international strategies to tackle global food shortages, as well as climate.

Dr Steve Arnold, a senior lecturer in atmospheric composition at the University of Leeds, who led the study, said: 'Our findings demonstrate that air pollution plays a significant role in reducing global crop productivity.

'It shows that the negative impacts of air pollution on crops may have to be addressed at an international level rather than through local air quality policies alone.'

Michael Hollaway, a PhD student at the University of Leeds, used a computer model to predict reductions in global surface ozone if man-made emissions of nitrogen oxide from the three continents were shut off.

Using crop location and yield calculations, he and the research team were able to predict impacts on staple food crops, each with their own unique sensitivity to ozone pollution.Dr Lisa Emberson a senior lecturer from the University of York: 'This study highlights the need for air pollution impacts on crops to be taken more seriously as a threat to food security.

'Air quality is often overlooked as a determinant of future crop supply Given the sizeable yield losses of staple crops caused by surface ozone, coupled with the challenges facing our ability to be food secure in the coming decades further coordinated internationalÂ  efforts should be targeted at reducing emissions of ozone forming gases across the globe.'
