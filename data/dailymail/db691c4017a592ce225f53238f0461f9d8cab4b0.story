Like the old saying goes: if you hang out with chickens, you're going to cluck.

It should come as no surprise then that Crackle, a six month old pig from Darwin, has started acting like a dog after spending all his time with a blue healer named Tyson. 

The owner of the pig Terry Cox told Daily Mail he picked Crackle up after a call from his local RSPCA.

 Crackle was quick hit it off with Tyson, a 10-year old blue heeler. But soon the pig started to copy everything Tyson did, including playing fetch

'The manager from my local branch called me up a couple of months ago and offered him to me. He had been spotted around town a couple of times, but nobody had managed to catch him.

'He was four months old at the time, and he was just a tiny little thing. I figured why not.'

Crackle was quick hit it off with Tyson, a 10-year old blue heeler. But it soon became apparent that Crackles was having somewhat of an identity crises.

'Crackle started copying everything Tyson does. He jumps and sits on my lap when I'm watching Telly, he follows me around the house, he plays fetch.'

'The funniest thing is the barking. He's genuinely learned to bark. Even my neighbours have said it-it sounds exactly the same as Tyson. He even makes growling noises.'

Terry Cox says that Crackle has learned to bark and growl in a way that sounds exactly the same as his canine counterpart

Terry says pigs are great household pets. He believes that they are very smart and are easier to train that dogs

Mr Cox also owns eight chickens and for Barramundi, and he says that pigs are a great option for a household pet. 

'They're very smart. You still need to train them, obviously, but I'd say they might be easier to train than dogs.'

It's not the first time that pigs have imitated dogs. In 2011, there were reports of a pig named Louie that competes in dog talent shows in North Wales.

In 2013, a story surfaced about Gilbert, a pig from Cheshire, who was raised with a pair of Yorkshire Terriers and started rolling over, begging for biscuits and bringing in the newspaper for its owner.
