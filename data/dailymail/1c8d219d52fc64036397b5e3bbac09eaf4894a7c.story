A father has been arrested for assault after his own daughter posted a video on Snapchat apparently showing him attacking a teenager during a road rage altercation.

Steven Paula, 43, allegedly attacked 18-year-old Mason Deal in Parker, Colorado, leaving him with a black eye and a concussion - and his daughter caught the whole episode on her cell phone.

Police say that the girl then posted the video on Snapchat and a screenshot was saved by a friend, before the footage was deleted. 

The image was then passed on to a friend of the victim and was shared with the police.

The image - which appears to show Paula swinging at Mr Deal - allowed police to identify him as their suspect

Mason Deal, 18, said the incident occurred while he was heading along a stretch of road in Parker, Colorado

According to Fox 31 Denver, police initially had very little to go on, but the single image - which appears to show Paula swinging at Mr Deal - allowed them to identify him as their suspect.

Mr Deal told the news channel: 'Part of me feels bad for her thinking that it was okay to post something like that on social media - and think it was funny - but at the same time she gave us everything we needed and for that I'm grateful.'

He said the incident occurred while he was heading along a stretch of road in Parker, some 20 miles from Denver, that merges from two lanes to one. The suspect allegedly tried to pass him  and the two cars clipped each other.

Mr Deal recalled stopping his car and seeing the other driver getting out of his minivan. He said he thought the man was going to ask him for his insurance information, but instead he attacked the teenager.

'Social media is a powerful thing,' Mr Deal's father Mike said in an interview with Fox 31 Denver. 'If we didn't have that one image we would be sitting here today wondering who did this.'

Mike deal added that it was 'incredibly fortunate for us' but 'incredibly thoughtless and stupid' of Paula's daughter to post the video of the attack on Snapchat.

Police said Paula was booked with misdemeanor assault because no weapon was used and there was no permanent injury to the victim.
