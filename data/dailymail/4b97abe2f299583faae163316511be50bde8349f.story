Video emerged today apparently showing the three runaway British schoolgirls in Turkey before they fled into Syria to become brides for Islamic State militants.

The footage is believed to have been taken by a foreign spy who was yesterday arrested for helping the trio cross the border.

Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, can be heard talking to an Arabic interpreter about  fake Syrian passports while laden with bags. 

The girls are said to have first arrived at Istanbul Ataturk Airport before heading to the southern city of Gaziantep close to the Syrian border.

From there, they reportedly take a taxi to an arranged meeting point where they are greeted by the spy, named by Turkish media as Muhammed Al Rashad.

On the run: New footage has emerged that claims to show three British schoolgirls in Turkey before they fled across the border in Syria to become jihadi brides for ISIS militants

Caught on camera: The footage is believed to have been taken by a foreign spy working for the Canadian intelligence service who was arrested on Thursday for helping the trio cross the border

Runaways: Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16, are understood to have since reached the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa after fleeing the UK to join a friend last month

Footage shows him instructing them to take their baggage and not leave anything behind and says they will be in Syria within the hour.

Al Rashad can be heard saying 'Come on sisters ... Don't forget anything. You will be there in an hour insh'Allah,' before the girls' luggage is unloaded from the taxi and the trio are helped into a silver minivan.

He speaks both English and Arabic in the four minute-long video and his face is visible at several points.

Al Rashad then allegedly delivered the girls to ISIS and returns to Turkey, where he is arrested, according to Daily Sabah. 

Separate footage released by Daily Sabah appears to show Al Rashad being taken into custody in Sanliurfa near the Syrian border. 

One report said he was a Syrian who was working for the Canadian intelligence service. Another said that he was a dentist.

Turkish news agency Dogan said Rashad has been held in solitary confinement in a prison in Sanliurfa province since being caught. 

Citing his testimony to police, it said he had identified fighters he helped enter Syria to an official at Canada's embassy in Jordan.

'I have no intention of spying. My aim is to prevent terrorist activity,' Dogan quoted him as saying. 

Rashad also allegedly told the agency he had accompanied at least 25 foreign fighters so far to Gaziantep.

He said: 'Border commanders within Islamic State instructed me where to drop these people. I drove them to Gaziantep city centre in a cab and handed them over to others. 

'I don't know how and from where they took them to Syria.' 

Evidence: The secret camera shows an alleged spy working for the Canadian intelligence agency helping the girls with their bags and arranging their fake Syrian passports

Suspect: Separate footage claims to show the Canadian intelligence agent being led to the courthouse by plain-clothed police officers after he was arrested on suspicion of helping the cross into Syria

The film featuring the three girls was confiscated after his arrest.   

Turkish foreign minister Mehmet Cavusoglu yesterday said the suspect worked for the intelligence agency of a country that is part of the US-led coalition fighting ISIS.

But he did not identify the country, saying only that it was not the United States or a member of the European Union.

Canada's Office of the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness said: 'We are aware of these reports.

'We do not comment on operational matters of national security.' 

The footage shows the girls walking with another man who is suspected of helping them cross into Syria

Mr Cavusoglu, who was interviewed on Turkish channel A Haber TV, said he had shared the information with his British counterpart - Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond. 

Britain's Foreign Office had no immediate comment and a spokesman for the Metropolitan police said he had no information.

The schoolgirls are understood to now be in the terror group's de facto capital Raqqa after fleeing the UK last month. 

It emerged earlier this week that the three girls had paid for their flights out of the UK after stealing jewellery from their family.  

A man has been arrested for allegedly helping three British schoolgirls - Shamima Begum, Amira Abase, both 15, and Kadiza Sultana, 16 (above) - cross into Syria to become Jihadi brides for Islamic State militants 

The girls were pictured going through security at Gatwick Airport last month, dressed in Western clothes

Police discovered they paid the £1,000 cost of their flights from Gatwick airport to Istanbul in cash.

Before they went missing, the girls are believed to have communicated with 20-year-old Aqsa Mahmood, a notorious jihadi who left Glasgow for Syria last year.

The former medical student has become the online contact of choice for those wanting to travel to Syria and marry a militant fighter. 

One of the girls, Shamima Begum, used her Twitter account to try to contact her directly, asking for her to open a private line of communication. 

Friends suspect the girls were in touch with Mahmood and Islamic State recruiters via their mobile phones in the weeks before Christmas.

The girls were pictured going through security at Gatwick Airport last month, dressed in Western clothes.  

They were later seen on CCTV in Turkey, dressed in burkas and waiting for a bus to take them to the border with Syria.

They are now believed to be in Raqqa, Islamic State's stronghold and scene of some of its most barbaric atrocities.

It is thought they were staying with a British girl – believed to be a pupil from their school who went missing in December and is believed to have joined ISIS. 

The 15-year-old student, the first to disappear from Bethnal Green Academy in east London, has not been identified by the authorities. 

Mark Rowley, who has overall responsibility for police counter terrorism, said the three girls would not be arrested for terrorist offences if they returned to the UK.

'We have no evidence in this case that any of the three girls are responsible for any terrorist offences,' he said. 

Over the weekend it also emerged that letters from Scotland Yard to the girls' families – explaining that the pupils would be part of the inquiry into their friend's disappearance – had been given to the schoolgirls rather than their parents.

Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe admitted that 'with the benefit of hindsight' officers should have communicated directly with the families.  

But he said parents had a responsibility to come forward if their teenagers betrayed any interest in extremist ideology.

However, the families refused to accept any responsibility for the teenagers' actions when they appeared before a committee of MPs earlier this week.  

Instead, they spent spent more than an hour castigating police over what they claimed was a failure to inform of their children's potential radicalisation. 

They were led by their lawyer Tasnime Akunjee, once the representative of a close associate of the Woolwich killers, who repeatedly demanded an apology. 

He accused Scotland Yard of a catalogue of errors in its handling of the disappearance of the trio in February and their close friend in December.  

Extreme beliefs: The Al-Khansa Brigade (pictured with automatic weapons) in Raqqa has said children as young as nine should be encouraged to marry and it is women's duty to obey men - who are their masters

Evidence: Khadiza's cousin Fahmida Aziz (left), Shamima's sister Sahima Begum (centre) and Amira's father Hussen Abase (right), appeared before the House of Commons home affairs committee earlier this week

The country's top police officer was later forced to apologise to the families over a misplaced letter relating to the fourth girl's disappearance.  

However, senior figures, led by David Cameron, insisted parents must take responsibility and play their part in stopping the spread of militant beliefs. 

'Everyone has a role to play,' said the Prime Minister.  

Foreign Secretary Phillip Hammond echoed the comments saying: 'Parents have responsibilities, schools and community workers have responsibilities as well as the authorities and airports and airline operators.'  

At least 22 young women, the vast majority under the age of 20, are feared to have travelled to Syria from the UK over the past 12 months.

Police said the total confirmed number of people travelling to fight is now around 700, with many more suspected of flying out undetected. 

Islamic State seized large swathes of land last June, including territory close to the Turkish border. 

The U.S.-led coalition is using mostly air power in an attempt to push the Sunni militant group back.
