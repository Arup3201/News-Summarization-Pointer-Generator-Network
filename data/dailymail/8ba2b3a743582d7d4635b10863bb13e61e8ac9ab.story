Cheltenham Town have two games to preserve their Football League status - and manager Gary Johnson has revealed one of the techniques he is using to try and bring the best out of his players.

When Johnson took over as manager of the League Two club on March 30, he wrote 'I promise to do all I can to keep Cheltenham Town in the league' on an A3 sheet of paper and asked his players to put their signature on it.

'They all signed it,' Johnson said to the BBC. 'Some signed it and meant it, and some signed it and didn't mean it.

'When you come to this stage of the season you need everyone to give everything for the cause,' Johnson added. 

'You also need team-mates you can rely on. The lads that are here need to know they can rely on the others - and if they can't rely on some then you have to move them on.'

Cheltenham occupy 23rd in League Two and trail 22nd placed Hartlepool United and the safety places by a point.

Their final two games are against second placed Shrewsbury and 13th placed Wimbledon.
