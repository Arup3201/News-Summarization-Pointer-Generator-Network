A teenage professional footballer attacked two nightclub bouncers while shouting racist abuse and claiming he was a 'gipsy fighter' during a night out to mark his birthday, a court heard. 

Crewe Alexandra winger Ryan Colclough, 19, was in the Liquid nightclub in Hanley, Staffordshire, when he was alleged to have racially abused bouncer Mo Khan and threatened to kill him.

Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court was told Colclough was then thrown out of the club, but the trouble continued outside, with Colclough claiming to be a 'gipsy fighter' and punching another doorman.

Footballer: Crewe Alexandra winger Ryan Colclough, 19, (left) is accused of attacking two bouncers at the Liquid nightclub in Hanley, Staffordshire, (right) while shouting racist abuse and claiming he was a 'gipsy fighter' during a night out to mark his birthday

The winger denies assault occasioning actual bodily harm, racially aggravated assault by beating, and racially aggravated intentional harassment, alarm or distress.

Stuart Clarkson, prosecuting, said Liquid door supervisor Mr Khan was alerted to Colclough’s behaviour inside the venue at 2am on December 27 last year.

'Mr Khan simply wanted a word about what may or may not have happened,' he said. 

In action: Colclough, (left) from Stanfield, Staffordshire, is playing in his second season with League One club Crewe Alexandra, and has scored two goals this year

Nightspot: The court heard Colclough punched one bouncer, Mo Khan, and was then thrown out of the club, only to  punch another doorman, Stuart Mann, above his eyebrow

Denial: Colclough claims he acted in self-defence, saying he says he was the victim, and the door staff were the aggressors

'The defendant did not want to speak to him.

'Mr Khan tapped him on the arm and asked if he could speak to him. The defendant shrugged away.

'He was not going to be spoken to about anything, as far as Mr Khan was concerned.

'Another door staff member attended and Mr Khan took hold of Colclough’s arm.

'The effect was Colclough punched Mr Khan to his temple and then delivered a second blow to the right side of his jaw.

'There was a struggle and both men fell to the floor. As this was going on, the defendant was shouting racial abuse at Mr Khan.'

The court heard Colclough was then thrown out of the club where he then punched another doorman, Stuart Mann, above his eyebrow.

Mr Khan told the court: 'I tapped him on the arm to get his attention. I got his attention, but with a blow to the side of my head, on the right temple.

'Once I got him to the floor the racial abuse started. He said, "Wait until I get you, I am going to kill you, you dirty scumbag".

'Outside, he started being aggressive to me and Stuart. He claimed to be a gipsy fighter. He said, "You scumbag, go back to your own country".

'He managed to punch Stuart above the eyebrow.'

Colclough, from Stanfield, Staffordshire, claims he acted in self-defence. He says he was the victim, and the door staff were the aggressors.

The footballer is playing in his second season with League One club Crewe Alexandra, and has scored two goals this year.

The trial continues.
