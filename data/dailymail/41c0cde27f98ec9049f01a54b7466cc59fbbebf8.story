A toddler has dramatically cheated death after falling 10 feet out of an open first floor window and landing on a tiny cushion that had been thrown away.

One-year-old Leonte Ward is recovering well despite suffering a 
fractured skull as a result of the terrifying plunge from his older brother’s 
bedroom window at his home in Thetford, Norfolk.

Leonte was rushed to West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St Edmunds by his mother Katie, 25, following the fall early on Sunday morning, but was well-enough to go home the following evening.

Leonte's life was saved because his 10 foot fall was broken by a foot-square dining chair cushion.

As he sustained a hairline skull fracture despite landing on the cushion, it is likely he would have suffered fair greater head injuries or even death had he hit the concrete directly.

Leonte’s relieved mother last night described the incident as 'horrifying'.

'I just thank God that he hit the cushion and not the concrete, because I don’t know what would have happened to him,' she said.

Leonte fell out of the open window after climbing on to his older brother's bed.

CT scans showed he had sustained the fracture and he was kept in for observation on Sunday night.

Ms Ward said the accident happened 'in the blink of an eye', adding: 'My eldest child had a sleepover the night before and had opened the window because it was a bit hot and stuffy in his room.'

'Leonte was in bed with me and my partner having his milk and then he got up to go to his brother’s room,' she said.

'A few seconds later we heard my six-year-old screaming, sprinted in there and saw the window open...We ran downstairs and he was just lying there, she added.

Ms Ward rang 999 and an ambulance and rapid response doctor arrived at the scene within minutes.

'I was devastated...I can’t stand him even being ill and in that situation you just think the worst,' she said.

Police officers investigated the incident but will be taking no further action after finding no criminal culpability.
