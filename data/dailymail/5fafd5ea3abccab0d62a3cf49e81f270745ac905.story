A stranded piglet had to be rescued by firefighters after wandering into the middle of a frozen lake.

Farmer Jan Klumaski discovered the piglet was missing from his barn and went in search of the animal - eventually finding it stuck on the lake in Ryk, Poland.

Unable to reach the piglet, the farmer called emergency services who sent several firefighters to the scene.

Skating on thin ice: Firefighters use a sledge to rescue a piglet from a frozen lake in Ryk, Poland

Firefighters had to use a sledge to slowly inch out on to the ice which was beginning to crack under the weight.

A fire brigade spokesman said: 'The piglet was shivering and was clearly scared so the officers went into action on a sledge.

'It was touch and go.  If the piglet fell through the ice he would have been a goner.

'It was touching to see the faith in his little eyes as we moved closer to him.'

The firefighters eventually managed to grab the piglet and put him a cage.

The spokesman added: 'Getting him into the cage was a bit 
hairy as he started to kick and squirm. Luckily, the ice held and we 
managed to get back to dry land safely.'

Despite the dangers, the spokesman admitted the firefighters did enjoy the icey mission.

He said: 'If truth be told, I think they enjoyed the ride. But of course the safety of the pig took precedence over any fun.'

The piglet was reunited with its owner Mr Klumaski, who said: 'He somehow managed to escape from his pen, but I think he'll be happy to be back.  I don't like to see animals suffer.  The firemen are the real heroes in this story.'
