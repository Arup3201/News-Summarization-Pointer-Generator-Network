Shocking CCTV footage shows the horrifying moment a baby is kidnapped while his unsuspecting mother sleeps at a train station in India.

Two-month-old Salman Shaikh was kidnapped from his mother's arms at the busy Dadar Railway Station in Mumbai.

And despite the devastating episode being captured on CCTV cameras, Indian police have failed to find the baby or the kidnapper.

Terrifying: Shocking CCTV footage shows the moment a baby being kidnapped while his mother slept at a train station in IndiaÂ 

Salman was sleeping next to his mother Parveen Shaikh, 35, and his three-year-old sister Sajida on March 9.

Parveen, who works as a construction worker in the city, told police she'd argued with her husband the previous day and had left him.

With nowhere to go, she and her children had slept at the train station for the night.

The CCTV footage shows a man in a white shirt and black trousers hovering near the family before sitting down next to them.

Making his move: The man craddled the child in his lap for a few seconds

Walking away: After checking the coast is clear - the man walks out away calmly with the baby in his arms

More than 90,000 children go missing in India each year; more than 34,000 are never found.

Some parents say they lost crucial time because police wrongly dismissed their missing children as runaways, refused to file reports or treated the cases as nuisances.

Campaigners say ineffective policing and useless laws are blamed for the high number of missing children in India.

Activists say some children are trafficked and forced to beg on the streets.

Some work on farms or factories as forced labor and others have their organs harvested and sold.

The activists say young girls are pushed into the sex trade or sold for marriage.

Delays let traffickers move children to neighboring states, where the police don't have jurisdiction, activists say.

There is no national database of missing children that state police can reference.

Police have insisted that most of missing children are runways fleeing grinding poverty.

After just a few minutes he is seen scooping up Salman in his arms and walking away.

Ravinder Dalvi, the investigating 
officer at Mumbai police, said: 'We have failed to find the baby or the 
kidnapper so far. We're still working on the case but it seems they've 
left the city. We're still hoping to find the baby and unite the family.

Dadar
Railway Station is one of the busiest stations in Mumbai and has around
the clock security following the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.

Nearly
90,000 children go missing every year in India, many of them are 
kidnapped by criminal gangs and are trafficked into the sex trade and 
begging rings.

Campaigners say ineffective policing and useless laws are blamed for the high number of missing children in India.

Bhuwan Ribhu, a child rights campaigner, said: 'Each missing child in India is actually kidnapped. Someone somewhere is holding him or her illegally. Police don't do anything to find these poor innocent children.'

Last week, a five-year-old girl, known in the press as Gudiya, was kidnapped from her family and gang-raped and left to die by two men in New Delhi.

Police refused to investigate the case, forcing the family to search for her on their own.

Neighbours - who heard her crying in a locked room inside the same building where she lived with her family - found her two days later.

The girl is currently undergoing treatment at a New Delhi hospital.
