Beware any lady who invites a One Direction member to her home - their fans are famously protective. But they might make an exception for this one.

The Queen gave Niall Horan the star treatment today after he was included in a list of Irish cultural heroes at Buckingham Palace.

And the thrilled 20-year-old didn't let his age knock his confidence, joking: 'I might ask her if she wants to come to a show.'

One's Direction: The Queen was all smiles when she met the 20-year-old pop sensation Niall Horan at a reception today to recognise those who have enriched Irish culture. He was by far the youngest there

Historic: The reception was held ahead of the first state visit to Britain by an Irish President next month

Royally envious? Some of 1D's famously protective female fans may baulk at seeing Niall with another woman

Niall, who came straight from a One Direction rehearsal and appeared alongside X Factor judge Louis Walsh, said being at the Palace was 'mind-blowing'.

He added: 'It's an absolute honour to be here with two great countries coming together.

'I couldn't believe it when I got the invitation. To have met Her Majesty again was a great experience.

'[The others] were really happy when I told them. They know it's an Irish thing so they're not being left out. I might ask her if she wants to come to a show.'

But it was not Niall's first Royal visit - he and his four bandmates met the Queen after they appeared at the Royal Variety Performance in November 2012.

Today's reception was held to mark the first official state visit by an Irish President to Britain next month.

President Michael D Higgins will come to Britain after the Queen became the first British monarch to visit the Republic of Ireland three years ago.

Joke: Louis Walsh laughs during the reception at Buckingham Palace, which included 300 guests

The Queen and Prince Philip chatted with 300
Irish guests from the world of sport, business, politics, the arts, and 
community work, who have all made a positive contribution to Britain.

Guests included singer Imelda May and hat designer Philip Treacy - who fashioned 36 headpieces for the Royal wedding including the fascinator worn by Princess Beatrice.

Others at the ceremony were fashion designer Orla Kiely, racehorse trainer Jonjo O'Neill and former 
Formula One racing boss Eddie Jordan.

Irish 
ambassador to Britain Dan Mullhall and Northern Ireland secretary Teresa Villiers also attended alongside Princess Anne and her husband, the Duke
 and Duchess of Gloucester, and the Duke of Kent.

Louis Walsh said the Queen told him she would love to come back and visit Ireland again.

'She said she thought she picked the perfect moment to come while Mary McAleese was still president,' he said.

'She is an amazing woman and she proved that on her visit. Everybody loves her.

'I didn't ask if she watches The X Factor but I think she might be watching Strictly Come Dancing.'

"From
 the Queen down, everyone is wholeheartedly invested in the visit by the
 President and would like to return the hospitality. This evening's 
event kicks off that process."

The Queen asked a fishmonger if he had brought any fish with him - after recognising him from a previous visit in 2011.

Pat O'Connell said he met the Queen at the English Market in Cork during her visit to Ireland in 2011.

At the time he made headlines by sharing a joke with the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh about an unattractive monkfish - which he said was nicknamed 'the mother-in-law fish'.

The Queen did not forget him this evening, greeting him with the words: 'You're here, have you bought any fish with you?'

Laugh: The Queen instantly recognised Cork fishmonger Pat O'Connell (third from right) from her historic state visit to Ireland in 2011 - and asked him if he had brought any fish along with him

Awestruck: Mr O'Connell (right) said: 'I'm very surprised to be here. I sell fish in Cork. I'm one of 44 traders and any one of them could have been here tonight'. He sent the Queen a signed photo of them together

Mr O'Connell said: 'We had great fun in Cork when she visited.

'I told the Queen when she last came to see me was the week of my 30th wedding anniversary and I said that the last time I was this well-dressed was 33 years ago.

'She laughed and then she asked me if I brought her any fish.'

Mr O'Connell also sent the Queen a copy of his autobiography, The Fishmonger, and signed a photo of them in Cork. 'Apparently it's hanging somewhere around Buckingham Palace,' he added.

'I'm very surprised to be here. I sell fish in Cork. I'm one of 44 traders and any one of them could have been here tonight. I was just very lucky I hit it off with the Queen when she arrived and am here representing Cork and the English market.'

A
Palace spokesman said the Irish President's visit next month was 'both exceptional and historical'.

The spokesman added: 'Because
 of the phenomenal success of the Queen's visit to Ireland in 2011, 
where she was made to feel very welcome, there is a sense that visit was
 a really important moment in the bilateral relationship.'
