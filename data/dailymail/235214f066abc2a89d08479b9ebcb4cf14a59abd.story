Accused: Shareyll Hunter, 26 (pictured), allegedly drove a car into Alise Kelly, 21, pinning her against the wall of a house in Houston

A pregnant woman has had her foot amputated after a love rival deliberately crashed a car into her - pinning her against a building, police said.

Alise Kelly needed specialist hospital care after Shareyll Hunter allegedly crushed her against the house in Houston where Ms Kelly's boyfriend - and Hunter's ex - Chris Chaney lived.

The horrifying incident is said to have happened after Hunter, 26, who is also pregnant, turned up at Mr Chaney's home this morning and began arguing with Ms Kelly.

The force of the crash left a wall at the property partly demolished.

A shoe, apparently belonging to Ms Kelly, could be seen lying amongst the rubble after being knocked off.

Mr Chaney told khou.com that he was in the house asleep when Hunter arrived at the property.

He said the pair had been 'texting and talking over the phone saying they want to fight each other and meet up right here and do it.'

Mr Chaney said that when he came outside he saw Ms Hunter shouting that she wanted to fight Ms Kelly.

The police said Hunter eventually jumped into his Lincoln car and put her foot down - pinning Ms Kelly, 21, against the house.

Witnesses have spoken of hearing Ms Kelly screaming in agony after being hit by the vehicle and out of fear for her unborn child. Both of her legs are believed to have been broken during the incident.

Pain: Witnesses said they could hear Ms Kelly screaming in agony after she was pinned against the wall

Argument: The pair - who are both pregnant - are believed to have rowed outside the home of Chris Chaney (pictured) who is Ms Kelly's boyfriend, and Hunter's ex

One of her feet was so badly damaged it had to be amputated - but her baby is thought to be unharmed.

Hunter, who is five months pregnant, is then alleged to have sped off in Mr Chaney's Lincoln LS car - and has not yet been caught by the police.

Mr Chaney, who already has two children with Hunter, said she and Ms Kelly are both pregnant by him.
