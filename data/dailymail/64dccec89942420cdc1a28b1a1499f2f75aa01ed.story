A 14,000-square-foot palace built by a former NFL player has been burned to the ground as part of a firefighter training exercise.

The luxurious estate in Gretna, Nebraska, was home to ex-Buffalo Bills safety Rod Kush and was once worth $2.6 million.

But the 'finest mansion in all of Sarpy County' was set alight yesterday morning by the Gretna Volunteer Fire Department, after being overrun with mold.

Fire crews first set individual rooms on fire to practice fighting a residential blaze.

Eventually the whole mansion was set on fire and a crowd of onlookers watched the mansion burn to the ground.

'It would cost more to mitigate the mold damage than the house is worth,' Sarpy County Assessor Dan Pittman told the Omaha World-Herald.

Mr Kush, who also owned a chain of 
small furniture stores, completed the lavish 17-room home in 1997 and 
sold it after 10 years, when he ran into financial troubles.

The
property, which sits on 35 acres, changed hands a couple of times 
before it was snapped up by a developer for just $612,000 in 2010.

But
last month Mr Pittman said the mansion is now worthless.

He said a 
leaky roof was never fixed and mold soon took over the house.

'At one time there was nothing like it in Sarpy County, with that big staircase like something out of 'Gone with the Wind,'' Mr Pittman told the newspaper.

'But it got to the point where there was standing water in the house and it wasn't safe to enter it without a mask.'

The palace was built between 1996 and 1997 by the Omaha native whose NFL career lasted from 1980 to 1986.

After retiring, he opened Rod Kush's 
Furniture, a store that was well-known in the greater Omaha area but 
went out of business in 2007.

Mr Kush initially put the property on the market for $3.4 million in 2003.

He finally sold it for $1.6 million in December 2008 to FRK Development of the Elkhorn area.

After a year, FRK Development donated
the property to Catholic Charities, which planned to open a 16-bed 
substance-abuse treatment centre on the site but a lack of funds meant 
it never happened.

Massive: the mansion has 17-rooms, which firefighters will set alight one by one

Research: 'We'll be doing the research to find at what temperature will metal lose its strength,' the Fire Chief Rod Beuthe said

In October 2010, the organisation 
sold it to Larry D. Smith. Property developer Kevin Irish now owns the home and wants the decrepit property gone so 
he can build a new development on the land.

It isn't clear what he wants to put on the space but previously discussed options included multifamily structures or perhaps an 
assisted living facility.
