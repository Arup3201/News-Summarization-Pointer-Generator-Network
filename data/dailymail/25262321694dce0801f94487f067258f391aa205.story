A teddy bear fanatic has spent more than 40 years building up 'Britain's biggest collection' of Rupert Bear memorabilia and has even given her collection an entire room in her house.

Doreen James, from Worcestershire, fell in love with the white bear in a red jumper when she was a little girl.

Now, 65 years after being given her first Rupert annual, she is the owner of what she believes is the UK's largest hoard.

Lifelong passion: Doreen James in her special 'Rupert room' which houses her Rupert Bear memorabilia which she has built up over the last 40 years

Bear essentials: Doreen has scores of cuddly Rupert toys as well as some of his friends, including Bill Badger and Podgy Pig

Doreen, a retired receptionist, has spent thousands over the years on her hobby, which contains everything from annuals to tins of Rupert pasta and chocolate wrappers from the 1970s.

Her collection grew so large she was forced to give some of it away and has so many Rupert ornaments on display she has now given up dusting.

After 40 years of packing away her ever-expanding collection in boxes, she decided to create a 'Rupert room' where everything from the curtains to the bedding and even the rugs are plastered with Nutwood's most famous son.

Doreen, whose eccentric home was even used as a meeting point for Midlands members of the Rupert fan club - Followers of Rupert - for 14 years, said: 'I have always loved Rupert, but I never intended to start a collection. It just sort of happened.

'My parents bought me my first Rupert annual when I was about five years old, and I got one for Christmas every year - it was always very exciting.

'I would spend hours reading them, I loved the stories. But as I got older, I stopped collecting and gave my annuals away. I thought I'd grown up, but I was obviously wrong.

'I was in my 20s when I came across an old annual in a toyshop one day, and I bought it for old times' sake.

'Once I'd re-read it, though, I wanted to replace all of my old collection - and I started trying to find all the old copies.

'I bought a new copy of the annual every year, too. But one day I saw a really unusual Rupert teddy, with porcelain hands, and I had to have him - and it spiralled from there.'

The most expensive item in Doreen's 
collection is an original 1936 Rupert annual - the first ever published -
which set her back an undisclosed four-figure sum.

Rekindled her love: As a child, Doreen would spend hours reading her Rupert annuals, but as she got older, she gave them away not realising that she would live to regret that decision and start collecting again

Collection, collection, collection: Doreen has a huge 4ft-high Rupert taking pride of place on the bed and an entire bookshelf dedicated to Rupert annuals and story books

Rupert Bear was created as a comic strip by English artist Mary Tourtel and first appeared in the Daily Express newspaper on November 8, 1920 in a bid to win sales from the rival Daily Mail and Daily Mirror.

He lives with his parents in a house in Nutwood, a fictional idyllic English village and is drawn wearing a red jumper and bright yellow checked trousers, with matching yellow scarf.

Originally depicted as a brown bear, his colour soon changed to white to save on printing costs, though he remained brown on the covers of annuals.

The success of the Rupert stories has led to the creation of several television series based on the character as well as a wide range of teddies and other products.

And although most of the items in her collection cost just a few pounds each, she estimates she has spent thousands on the bear over the years.

In her Rupert room, she has dozens of ornaments featuring scenes from her favourite Rupert stories, and scores of cuddly Rupert toys - as well a few cuddly friends - including his chum Bill Badger and Podgy Pig.

The cupboards in the room are full to the brim of Nutwood-themed goodies and rare items - including tins of lemonade and hundreds of jigsaw puzzles.

An entire bookshelf is dedicated to Rupert annuals and story books, with a huge four foot high Rupert taking pride of place on the bed.

Doreen added: 'I had so many items that I was running out of space for them, even with my Rupert room.

'I gave a lot of my Rupert bath toys and other items to charity, so hopefully someone else can benefit from my collection.

'My friends don't think it's strange I have a Rupert room - they're used to my bear obsession by now.

'I buy new items whenever I can. The Followers of Rupert meet annually and there's always lots of new items that people bring along to swap or sell.

'I also find a lot of items at antiques fairs - I usually find bits and pieces at Bromsgrove antiques market.

'My favourite Rupert story was one I read when I was very young, where a Christmas tree came to life, and started walking around.

'For years, I would sit in our garden and stare at the trees, convinced that they really might grow legs of their own one day.

'Rupert has lasted so well through the ages because everyone can relate to him - grannys, mums and dads and children all love him.

'I think he's so popular because he is safe, colourful, every mother's favourite son, and most importantly, he's always home in time for tea.'
