According to the Sacramento Bee, at 9pm police officers were on their way to an address in the Hayer Circle part of town, responding to information that Cooper allegedly planned to burn down the residence and was on his way over.

Before they reached the address, police received further information that an alleged firebomb-type device had been thrown into the property's window.

Inside the house there were several adults and a three-year-old child.

The occupants escaped without injury and fire personnel out out the blaze.

According to the sheriff's department press release, cops found Cooper hiding in nearby Dry Creek 20 minutes later.

Cooper is being held without bail.
