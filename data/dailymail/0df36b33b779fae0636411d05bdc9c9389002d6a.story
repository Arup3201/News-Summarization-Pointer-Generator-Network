Southampton manager Ronald Koeman has told Dejan Lovren he is not for sale and has ordered the Croatia defender to return for training on Sunday.

Lovren has been given extra time off after participating in the World Cup, but is due back this weekend. The centre back handed a formal transfer request to the club in May and has since spoken out about his discontent at St Mary’s.

But Koeman said: ‘I have  spoken twice to Lovren and I want to keep him. He has a  contract. He has to come back on Sunday. I do not know what will happen after that.

Not for sale: Dejan Lovren has been told he is staying at Southampton by new manager Ronald Koeman

‘We want to keep all that information in private. That was not a good thing on his side. I hope he will come back. I spoke to Dejan five days ago. He said it is a difficult situation and he will have another talk to his agent and the club. He knows he has to come back.’

Koeman is trying to stem the flow of star players leaving the club. After discussions with executive director Les Reed ahead of his appointment, Koeman was aware that Luke Shaw, who moved to Manchester United, Adam Lallana and Rickie Lambert, both now at Liverpool, would be leaving.

He is determined to keep hold of Lovren, who only signed for the club last summer for £8.5million from Lyon. But the Dutchman has a fight on his hands, with Liverpool and Manchester United both understood to be interested in the 25-year-old.

‘We are not a selling club,’ Koeman added. ‘We would like to keep the rest of our good players and bring better players in.’
