In a heart-warming throw back to the good old days, large-scale gold mining is once again on the verge of booming in California.

The California Mother Lode is the state’s main gold mining area, but the industry has been almost silent since the end of World War Two.

However next year there will be a commercial mine producing gold bars in the area for the first time in more than 50 years.

The Lincoln Mine will be re-opened near Highway 49, extract 1,800oz of gold per month and create 100 jobs, reported the Daily Telegraph.

There could be around $800million of gold underground - at a time when the price of gold is rising in an uncertain economic climate.

It comes more than 160 years after gold was discovered in the Golden State by a carpenter and everyone was soon piling into the industry.

But green campaigners are not happy about mining’s return to the area, especially raising concerns over potential pollution issues.

‘They're going to start their process,’ Dan Jacobson, of Environment California, told Fox News.

'They're going to start their process. Boom, the price of gold is going to drop and these companies are going to be out. And who cleans up that mess?'

But mine operators the Sutter Gold Mining Company say its modern and cleaner techniques will make it more environmentally-friendly.

The Lincoln Mine was a tourist attraction but its last underground tours took place last week as it gets ready to go back into production.

Another mining firm is expected to re-open a mine 60 miles away - and it follows other openings around the state in 2008 and 2009.
