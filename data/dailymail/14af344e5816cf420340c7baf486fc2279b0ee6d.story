David Cameron yesterday thanked David Bowie for backing the Union  as Scottish Nationalist leader Alex Salmond branded Westminster politicians ‘thieves’.

The Prime Minister revealed that he ‘let out a cry of joy’ when the music legend used his acceptance speech at the Brit Awards last week to urge: ‘Scotland, stay with us.’

Mr Cameron spoke out as both he and Mr Salmond, Scotland’s First Minister, stepped up hostilities over independence – both taking their cabinets to Aberdeenshire to fight over the future of the oil industry.

Delight: David Cameron revealed his reaction to David Bowie's pro-union message, which he admitted would resonate more than his own plea against independence

Supermodel Kate Moss delivered the 'stay with us' message from  67-year-old since who chose to stay in New York rather than attend the event in London to pick up his first Brit for 18 years

The Prime Minister, speaking yesterday
 on an oil platform in the North Sea, made clear his delight that Bowie 
had put the independence issue at the top of the agenda in a way he has 
failed to do.

Bowie did not 
attend the awards, but his message was read by supermodel Kate Moss when
 she collected his award for best male artist.

Mr
 Cameron, whose cabinet met in Aberdeen, told the BBC: ‘I was watching 
the Brit Awards and when I saw Kate Moss leap to the stage and utter 
those words I have to say I did let out a cry of joy because I’m sure 
that maybe someone like David Bowie might be able to reach parts of 
Scotland that perhaps I can’t.’

The
 Prime Minister issued his own positive message, saying: ‘This family of
 nations is better off together, not just that Scotland is better off in
 the United Kingdom but we in the rest of the United Kingdom think that 
we are better off with Scotland – that we want you to stay.’

First Minister Alex Salmond today accused Westminster politicians of 'jetting into Scotland and jetting out again'

Despite taking their Cabinet's to meet just seven miles apart, Mr Cameron will not meet Mr Salmond who repeated his call for a debate with the Prime Minister

Yesterday
 Mr Cameron argued that Scotland risks losing £200billion of investment 
in the oil industry if it chooses independence in September’s 
referendum.

He said that 
only by staying with the UK could the oil industry get the tax breaks it
 needs to invest in those North Sea oil and gas reserves that are harder
 to reach.

But Mr Salmond, a
 former Westminster MP, said: ‘I’ve got some form in oil and gas as I 
was an energy economist before I fell among thieves, by which I mean the
 House of Commons and not the Scottish Parliament or the Scottish 
Government.’

Mr Salmond, 
whose cabinet met in Portlethen, near Aberdeen, earlier told Radio 4’s 
Today programme that he had been working in the oil industry when Mr 
Cameron ‘was fooling around on the playing fields of Eton.’

Bowie's
 surprise intervention sparked a furious response from nationalists, who
 used the internet to tell the singer to 'f*** off back to Mars' and 
'keep your big mouth shut'.

However,
 the pro-union campaign, led by former Chancellor Alistair Darling, have
 been delighted with the impact of the comments from one of the world's 
biggets music stars.

They hope to persuade other celebrities to join the campaign ahead of the referendum on September 18.

Mr Cameron today revealed his reaction to Moss's message at Thursday;'s Brit Awards.

The
 Prime Minister told the BBC: 'I was watching the Brit Awards and when I
 saw Kate Moss leap to the stage and utter those words I have to say I 
did let out a cry of joy because I'm sure that maybe someone like David 
Bowie might be able to reach parts of Scotland that perhaps I can't.'

The
 admission came as Alex Salmond accused Westminster ministers of jetting
 in on ‘Scare Force One’ to bully and threaten Scots, as his own Cabinet
 arrived in nearby Porthlethen on a bus.

Mr Salmond has repeatedly challenged 
Mr Cameron to a head-to-head debate, but the PM insists arguments over 
independence should be thrashed out between Scots.

The Prime Minister warned investment in the oil and gas industry would be threatened by Scottish independence

While they hold their meetings just a short drive apart, there are no plans for the two men to meet.

Downing
 Street insisted that because Mr Cameron does not have a vote in the 
referendum it would be wrong for him to go head-to-head with Mr Salmond.

Instead
 he wants to see Mr Salmond go up against former Labour chancellor 
Alistair Darling, who is leading the Better Together campaign.

Visiting
 an oil rig 150 miles east of Aberdeen, Mr Cameron said: ‘I profoundly 
believe the United Kingdom will be better off if we all stay together.

‘We
 all bring things to this United Kingdom and I've been very clear to say
 on behalf of the rest of the United Kingdom to the people in Scotland 
we want you to stay.

‘We 
think that we'll benefit by you being in the United Kingdom, by keeping 
this family together, but in the end the choice has to be for people in 
Scotland.

‘It's their 
choice, they will make it, but I think it's important to lay out all the
 arguments of the benefits of staying together.’

The PM warned that an independent Scotland would find it harder to invest and deal with oil market volatility.

‘Because
 we are a top 10 economy we can afford the tax allowances, the 
investment, the long term structure that is necessary to make sure we 
recover as much from the North Sea as possible,’ he said.

The
 Prime Minister argues that vital investment in the oil industry could 
be put in jeopardy because Scotland would be unable to afford the 
generous tax breaks needed to encourage firms to seek out the remaining 
stocks.

Mr Cameron claims 
the 'broad shoulders' of the UK Government were able to support 
investment in the industry as volatility in the oil market could have a 
dramatic effect on Scottish finances in the event of independence.

The
 visit is designed to boost support against separation and comes as a 
poll shows support for independence has stalled while backing for the 
Union has bounced back.

The 
Scottish National Party is desperate to present Mr Cameron as an 
out-of-touch Conservative Englishman talking down to Scots.

But he has rejected advisers who urged him to keep out of the debate over independence, ahead of the referendum on September 18.

Mr Salmond  accused Westminster politicians of lecturing Scots as he chaired a meeting of his own Cabinet

Mr Salmond went on the attack, accusing Tory ministers from London of jetting in to lecture Scots.

He
 said: ‘Why don’t we have a debate? Why don’t we get that debate? 
Because I think there’s a difference between delivering a message on 
high or sending his Chancellor or his Foreign Secretary up to Scotland 
to tell us what to do.

‘There’s
 a difference between jetting into Scotland and jetting out again than 
having a real democratic debate about the future of the country.’

Following reports of senior ministers flying into the RAF base in Aberdeen, the SNP stepped up its attack.

Angus
 Roberston, SNP leader in Westmintser, said: 'This Cabinet Minister is 
clearly living the high life by chartering "Scare Force One" to Scotland
 – so that Westminster can once again talk down an independent 
Scotland.'

North Sea: The Cormorant oil field, north-east of Lerwick, Shetland. Scotland could miss out on a £200billion jackpot from North Sea oil if it votes for independence, David Cameron will warn today

According to an ICM poll, 37 per cent said they will vote Yes while 49 per cent said they will vote No.

The most significant factor in the latest poll is the swing from the 'don't knows' towards voting No.

An ICM poll in September found 32 per cent support for Yes, 49 per cent No and 19 per cent undecided.

The
 Yes camp took five points from the Noes in a second ICM poll in 
January, with the Yes vote rising to 37 per cent, No dropping to 44 per 
cent and a steadfast 19 per cent still undecided.

The
 new ICM poll shows undecided voters have dropped to 14 per cent with 
the No camp taking all the gains and the Yes camp standing still.
