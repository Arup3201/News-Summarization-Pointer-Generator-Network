Though animal rights groups like PETA outraged over the deaths of three horses on the set of HBO’s now-defunct series Luck, one animal trainer says the animals’ deaths are nothing more than tragic accidents.

Matthew Chew, who trained two of the three horses that died, reportedly told friends that it has been about luck only – or rather a lack of it – that has resulted in the horses’ deaths.

‘We were just horribly unlucky… sometimes s**t happens,’ he said, according to TMZ.

However, PETA alleges that he knowingly used ‘arthritic and injured horses’ and
raced even healthy horses more than the recommended amount.

Mr Chew was in charge of both Outlaw 
Yodeller and Marc’s Shadow. Outlaw Yodeller suffered a fatal injury on 
April 30, 2010, and Marc’s Shadow suffered a catastrophic breakdown on 
March 28 of last year.

Dr Rick Arthur, who worked on the 
production and serves as medical director at the California Horse Racing
Board, agrees that injuries happen.

‘Accidents do happen,’ he told TV 
Guide. ‘It’s not as outrageous as it’s been played to be. Any of these 
accidents are not unique circumstances.’

The third horse, for example, died on
the way back to its stall and hit her head on the ground. Trainers then
made the decision to euthanize her.

He said these so-called accidents are not ‘unique circumstances.’

Controversial: Now three horses have died on the set of Luck and HBO has suspended filming as the protocols are being reassessed

The HBO drama series Luck was 
cancelled earlier this week by network brass after a third thoroughbred died during 
production of the show, which stars Dustin Hoffman and Nick Nolte.

The decision came after the horse was injured and euthanised on Tuesday.

A
humane group that oversees Hollywood productions had issued an 
immediate demand 'that all production involving horses shut down'.

The American Humane Association has been overseeing the production since it started.

HBO said: 'While we maintained the highest safety standards possible, accidents unfortunately happen and it is impossible to guarantee they won't in the future'.

'Accordingly, we have reached this difficult decision.'

'Racing itself is dangerous enough. This 
is a fictional representation of something and horses are still dying, 
and that to me is outrageous'

-PETA representative

Animal rights group PETA have 
challenged HBO on their claims, saying these 'accidents' were waiting to
happen and a 'sloppy oversight'.

Whistleblowers
contacted them during the first season of the show but their complaints
went nowhere, even after the death of the first two horses, according 
to CBS.

The group then obtained documents through a Freedom of Information Act.

Earlier
this week they asked the Los Angeles district Attorney's Office to 
investigate the deaths of the horse. Spokeswoman Lisa Lange said: 'We 
got the necropsy reports on those horses and what we found was shocking.

'One of the horses had been pumped full of painkilling drugs, another one was old and arthritic.'

In
its defense, the AHA tried to argue the latest horse to die did not do 
so on set but as the result of an accident while being led back to its 
stable by a groom when it reared and fell back, suffering a head injury.

In its complaint, PETA said the first two horses died during and immediately after running in a 'race' being filmed for the show and that it is too mentally and physically demanding on retired racehorses.

Karen Rosa, senior vice president of the AHA's Film & TV Unit, told the Washington Post that the races filmed for the show weren't full length and no more than a quarter mile each.

But PETA vice president Kathy 
Guillermo said the horses would not understand it wasn't a real race  
and would have exerted themselves as if it was and the first two horses 
that died should not have been 'anywhere near a racetrack'.

'Racing is an exhausting activity and most young horses have at least a week’s rest between races to recover. These horses were sometimes asked to race twice in a day.'

Hard tack: Jill Hennessy also starred in in the series

She told the Washington Post: 'One of the horses was so sore, he was given a potent cocktail of 
muscle relaxant and anti-inflammatory and painkilling drugs, including 
Butorphanol, a painkiller so strong that it's often used as an analgesic
for horses undergoing some kinds of surgery.

'They could castrate a horse on that drug.'

But doctors hired by HBO contend that PETA misread the death report and the network released a statement saying that any allegations of 'lax attitudes or negligence couldn't be further from the truth'

Dr Rick Arthur, a veterinarian at the Santa Anita racetrack in California, told CBS News: 'HBO did everything they possibly could to ensure the safety of those horses.

'We see several of these injuries every year, it is more common than people realize.'

According to autopsy results, the first horse was a five-year-old male who suffered from a 'catastrophic humeral fracture' of its right front leg and was on multiple pain killers and anti-inflammatory medications.

The second, an eight-year-old male, had an open fracture of its right radius and a history of arthritis.

In the series, which looks at racing's
seedier side, Dustin Hoffman plays a crime kingpin who's scheming to 
gain control of a racetrack and introduce casino gambling.

During season-one filming in 2010 and 2011, two horses were hurt during racing scenes and euthanized.

HBO defended its treatment of the animals, saying it's worked with the American Humane Association and racing industry experts to implement safety protocols that exceed film and TV industry standards.

The American Humane Association's film and TV unit, the group sanctioned and supported by the entertainment industry to protect animals used in filming, called for a production halt at the Santa Anita Racetrack in suburban Arcadia after the second horse's death.

Racing resumed after new protocols were put in place and proved effective, Karen Rosa said in February.
