A woman who went for a routine smear test was astounded to be told she had two wombs and two cervixes.

Jane Woodhead, 38, had no idea she was suffering from a condition called uterus didelphys.

It means a woman can be born with any combination of two wombs, two separate cervixes and sometimes two vaginas. 

It also makes it possible to be pregnant twice at the same time - with a baby in each womb.   

Jane Woodhead, 38, went for a smear test and was astounded to be told she had two wombs. The condition can cause complications during pregnancy, but baby Grace, now 12 weeks old, was born healthy

When the female foetus is developing, two tubes normally join to create one larger, hollow organ - the uterus (top picture). But in a minority of women, including Ms Woodhead, the tubes don't join - allowing two hollow organs to form instead. This means the woman is born with two wombs (bottom picture)

After being diagnosed with the condition - which carries risks of complications during pregnancy - Ms Woodhead was told she would need IVF treatment if she ever wished to have children.

But weeks later, she found out she was already pregnant - and  later gave birth to her 'miracle baby', Grace. 

Ms Woodhead, from Barry, South Wales, said: 'When I was told about the uterus didelphys it was a huge surprise, as I'd been having routine smears for years and no one had picked it up.

'They said it was possible alternate ones had been checked, which was obviously a bit of a shock.

'To think it's something I was born with, but never knew, was bizarre.' 

Doctors explained she had a rare condition called 'uterus didelphys', also known as a double uterus, where a woman is born with two uteri, two separate cervixes and can sometimes even have two separate vaginas.

Only three per cent of women are born with an abnormality such as having two wombs every year.

The condition is normally diagnosed during an examination, a smear test or in a scan during pregnancy.

It occurs because in a female foetus, the uterus starts out as two small tubes.

As the foetus develops, the tubes normally join to create one larger, hollow organ.

Uterus didelphys, also known as a double uterus, is a condition where a woman is born with two uterus, to separate cervixes and sometimes two vaginas, though this is not always the case.

It occurs because in a female foetus, the uterus starts out as two small tubes.

As the foetus develops, the tubes normally join to create one larger, hollow organ — the uterus.

Sometimes the tubes don't join completely and each one develops into a separate hollow organ so the woman is born with two wombs.

It often only becomes noticeable after puberty and is diagnosed with a physical exam or an ultrasound scan.

In terms of physical anatomy, the two wombs are often slightly smaller than average in order to fit, though they can be as big as a 'normal' womb.

It also makes it possible to be pregnant twice at the same time - with a baby in each womb. 

Some women are also born with two vaginas, which can lead to complications with sex and during menstruation. 

Women will frequently have a slightly higher risk of late miscarriage, premature delivery and bleeding during pregnancy.

Often Caesarean sections are recommended, to reduce the risk of complications.

There is no treatment or cure for the condition. 

However sometimes the tubes don't join completely and each one develops into a separate hollow organ - so the woman is born with two wombs.

The condition often only becomes noticeable after puberty.

Dr Leila Hanna, a consultant gynaecologist & Obstetrician at BMI The Sloane Hospital, said  women can go for years without realising they have an extra womb.

She told MailOnline: 'Sometimes it's discovered in a physical exam, or when they have cervical smears.

'If the lady is pregnant and they have an early scan it can be picked up then.

'But if they don't have any tests, then it's not noticed - and they can go for years and years without knowing.'

In terms of physical anatomy, the two wombs are often slightly smaller than average in order to fit, though they can be as big as a 'normal' womb.

Two different pregnancies are also possible at the same time.

‘Although women normally produce only one egg a month, sometimes they can produce two,' explained Dr Hanna. 

‘If they have sex at the right time, they can have a pregnancy in each womb -  non-identical twins.

‘It’s a rare thing, but it can happen once in a blue moon. 

Some women are also born with two vaginas, which can lead to complications with sex and during menstruation.

Dr Hanna said: 'Some have a septum in the vagina. If they have two vaginas they will need to wear two tampons.

'If they've got one vagina it doesn't affect sex. But if they have two vaginas then there can be some difficulties with sex.'

And to properly check they are healthy, smear tests should be carried out in both cervixes.

She reiterated that having two wombs can lead to complications during pregnancy.

Ms Woodhead and partner Paul Herridge were delighted to find out she was pregnant with baby Grace, as doctors said the condition meant she would need IVF to have a baby. The condition is linked with higher risks of miscarriage, premature births and bleeding during pregnancy

'They're more likely to have a baby breach position and require a Caesarean. These woman are also more likely to have miscarriage.'

She added: 'If they've got a small uterus, they're more likely to have a pre-term birth.' 

After being diagnosed with uterus didephys, Ms Woodhead was told she would need IVF to have a baby.

She signed up for the treatment, which has a waiting list of up to 18 months.

But after feeling unwell, and doing a urine test for the GP, she was told she was seven weeks pregnant.

She said: 'What worried me the most was that I wondered if I'd ever be able to become a mum as they told me my chances of getting pregnant would be slim.'

'She's our lovely, beautiful miracle' Ms Woodhead said about her daughter

'I certainly didn't think it would be possible naturally. But just a week before we were about to have our first IVF appointment I was given the bombshell, brilliant news.

'I had to wait four days before having a scan which I needed for reassurance that everything was okay.

'They needed to check it wasn't ectopic and, sure enough, there was a baby in my left womb and I was very much pregnant.

'They did check the other womb and there was a chance I had been carrying another baby as they could see  something there... but there was definitely no heartbeat. It took a long time to sink in.'

The  risks for pregnant women, include early or late miscarriage, premature or early labour, low birth weight.

Doctors normally opt for a Caesarean to avoid these complications.

Ms Woodhead admitted the risks worried her.

She said: 'I had got through the first challenge of getting pregnant and I just wanted a successful outcome.

'We had to keep a close eye on everything and I had 17 scans in 39 weeks. 

'It was there that we found out we were having a little girl at 15 weeks and we were just so overwhelmed and excited.' 

She said: 'I never felt able to relax during the 39 weeks as I was aware of the risks and I was so grateful to be able to tick every week off the calendar and move closer to my due date.'

Grace Violet Herridge was born on July 18. 

'She was born 11 days after my 40th birthday and was the best 40th birthday present I could ever have asked for or dreamed of. She's my little miracle.

'I still stare at her for hours even now 12 weeks after she was born and can't believe she is really mine. 

'She is our lovely, beautiful miracle.'
