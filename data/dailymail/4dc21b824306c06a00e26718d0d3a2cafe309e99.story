Apple fell further behind rival Samsung in the battle of the smartphones with iPhone sales slowing and profits falling for the first time in ten years.

In the first three months of 2013 it sold 37.4million handsets compared to 35.1million a year earlier.

In contrast, Samsung is expected to shift 65million phones over the same period – up from 41million last year.

Lost its shine: Apple is expected to reveal first profit fall in a decade today as sales of iPhone and iPad sales slump

And with its latest Galaxy S4 phone 
going on sale as early as today in the US, the South Korean company 
looks set to extend its lead in the global smartphone race.

Apple, which last week lost its crown 
as the world’s most valuable company to oil giant Exxon Mobil, posted 
its worst set of results in the last decade.

The US tech giant’s profits for the 
period fell by 18 per cent to £6.3billion after it was forced to cut 
margins to keep prices down.

Sales were better than expected, 
rising 11.3 per cent to £28.6billion. Some 19.5million iPads were sold 
during the quarter, up from 11.8million.

Apple’s Wall Street shares have fallen by more than 40pc since September on fears that its flagship iPhone has lost its lustre.

But yesterday Apple tried to appease shareholders with a 15 per cent hike in dividend to $3.05 per share.

The results pile further pressure on Tim Cook, Apple’s boss who took over from founder Steve Jobs in January 2011.

However he assured shareholders: ‘Our 
teams are hard at work on some amazing new hardware, software, and 
services and we are very excited about the products in our pipeline.’

Drop: Apple's shares have hit their lowest levels in a year-and-a-half suggesting the company has lost crucial ground to rivals including Samsung

Since Cook  began running the company,
 Apple has only launched the iPad mini, which has sold poorly and 
whittled down profit margins.

Under Jobs, who died in October 2011, 
Apple released a series of revolutionary gadgets, from the music-playing
 iPod to the iPhone and the iPad.

Its products dominated every sphere the company entered, forcing rivals to play catch-up.

Now Cook faces renewed calls to launch new game-changing products.

Laurence Balter, technology analyst 
at Oracle, said: ‘It was OK when Steve Jobs would say we have some great
 things in the product line, but right now that credibility has been 
lost.’

He added: ‘The market needs to see some evidence that the future is bright because the candle is flickering.’

Shares in Apple hit a record high in September, but have dropped sharply since then.

Earlier this month the company that 
manufactures iPhones and iPads in China, Hon Hai Precision Industries, 
reported its biggest fall in sales in 13 years – raising suspicions 
Apple has cut orders for the coming months.
