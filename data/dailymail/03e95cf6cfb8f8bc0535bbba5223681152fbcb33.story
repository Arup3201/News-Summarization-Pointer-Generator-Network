A dramatic home video has emerged of the moment when a Mexican drug lord was shot and killed by an assassin dressed as a clown.

Francisco Rafael Arellano Felix was shot dead at a family birthday party on October 18 and a new video shows that the revelers had no idea what was going on.

The minute-long video shows a rather docile crowd sitting inside a party venue while a band and singer belts out a traditional song.

Halfway through, a clown wearing a bright blue costume and hot pink curly wig walks in front of the camera.

Moments later, the camera becomes obstructed and four successive gunshots are heard. People are then heard screaming and running.

The video was obtained by the local Tijiuana paper Semanario Zeta which reports that the assassination is still being investigated.

There were reports that the 'clown' was accompanied by two other people but it is not clear who they are or whether or not they were also wearing costumes.

The Felix family is a prominent one in the drug trade as the assassination target was the oldest brother of the leader of the Tijiuana Cartel.

Felix, 63, spent nearly 15 years behind bars for drug-related offenses after his arrest in Mexico in 1993.

American authorities found enough evidence to bring charges and Arellano Felix was extradited to the U.S. in 2006 to face California charges stemming from a 1980 case in which he allegedly sold cocaine to an undercover police officer.

After being granted parole and released, he returned to Mexico in 2008.

Led by a large family of brothers and sisters, the Tijuana Cartel was one of the most powerful drug gangs in Mexico until it was gradually weakened by the capture or killing of several leading members.

Arellano Felix's younger brothers, Francisco Javier, Benjamin and Eduardo are serving prison sentences in the U.S.

Another of his brothers, Ramon, was killed in a shootout with police in 2002.
