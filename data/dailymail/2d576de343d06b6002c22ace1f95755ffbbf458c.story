A former Florida A&M band member accused of being the ringleader of a brutal hazing ritual known as 'Crossing Bus C' that killed a drum major was convicted today of manslaughter and felony hazing.

Prosecutors said Dante Martin, 27, was known as 'the president of Bus C' and organized the initiations that required fellow band members to try to make their way through a pounding gauntlet of fists, drumsticks and mallets from the front of the bus to the back in November 2011 after a football game. 

Two other band members went through the bus before Robert Champion, 26, of Decatur, Georgia. Martin was convicted of misdemeanor hazing counts in their beatings.

Guilty: Former Florida A&M band member Dante Martin, 27 (left), pictured in court Monday, has been found guilty of manslaughter in the hazing death of drum major Robert Champion, 26 (right)

Hazing: Martin, left, was found guilty in court on Friday. On Monday, he was supported by his family members in court who sat behind him, pictured

At fault: Martin's defense attorneys (left and right) argued that Champion voluntarily took part in the Crossing Bus C ritual in 2011. The jury disagreed in their guilty ruling on Friday

Champion's parents, Pam and Robert Champion, sat silently as the verdicts were read. Martin sat with his head down.

Martin's sentencing was set for January 9 and he was taken into custody. He is facing up to 15 years in prison.

Champion complained of trouble breathing and vomited after the ritual, then collapsed and died of internal bleeding caused by severe bruising in a hotel parking lot after Florida A&M played Bethune-Cookman in their annual rivalry football game November 19, 2011.

His death cast a pall over the school's nationally acclaimed band, which had played at Super Bowls and before US presidents. The famed band was suspended for more than a year after the death and several school officials resigned in the aftermath.

Martin's defense attorneys told jurors the ritual was more akin to a competition and that there was no actual hazing. They said Champion and the others voluntarily participated.

Tragic end: Champion complained of trouble breathing and vomited after the ritual, then collapsed and died of internal bleeding in a hotel parking lot

Jail? Martin could face up to 15 years in prison when he is sentenced in January

Co-accused: Brian Jones, left, and Ryan Dean, right, have already been sentenced after pleading no-contest to third-degree felony hazing last year

'You can't take it in isolation and act like it was just any other band,' defense attorney Richard Escobar said during closing arguments. 'Brutal as it was, foolish as it was...it was competitive.'

Prosecutor Jeff Ashton said testimony made it clear that band members were looking for a measure of respect and acceptance by 'crossing Bus C.' But he challenged the defense's argument.

'Tradition didn't kill Robert Champion,' Ashton said. 'Tradition isn't to blame. Tradition is not an excuse...It's not a defense to those that got caught.'

Disgraced: The famed band was suspended for more than a year after the death and several school officials resigned in the aftermath

Grieving: Champion's parents, Pam and Robert Champion, were in the courtroom every day during the trial and sat silently when the guilty verdict was announced Friday 

Several other former band members have pleaded guilty to lesser charges, and three others await trial. 

Brian Jones and Ryan Dean were sentenced after pleading no-contest to third-degree felony hazing in 2012.

Jones was sentenced  to six months of community control, which strictly limits his freedom with measures including frequent check-ins with probation officials.

He also was given two years of probation and required to perform 200 hours of community service.

Dean received four years of probation and 200 hours of community service.
