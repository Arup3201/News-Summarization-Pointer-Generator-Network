Claims: The Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim has claimed the missing jet would have been tracked by the country's sophisticated radar system

The Malaysian opposition leader has claimed the missing jet would have been tracked by the country's sophisticated radar system and has accused the authorities of withholding information.

Politician Anwar Ibrahim said that when he was the Malaysian finance minister he had personally authorised the installation of the radar, and that the system would have picked up the missing plane changing course.

The 66-year-old also suggested it was possible that the Malaysian authorities had colluded in the fate of flight MH370, and said an international committee should take over the investigation into the disappearance of the aircraft.

He said that the integrity of the entire country was in jeopardy, and added that the families of the 153 Chinese passengers who were on board the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 were correct to seek more information from the Malaysian government.

The aircraft was carrying 239 passengers and crew on a flight from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing when it vanished on March 8.

Mr Anwar, who has admitted he was related to the plane's pilot Zaharie Ahmad Shah via an in-law, said the Marconi radar system, which covers the Malaysian mainland, including its east and west coastlines from its base in the South China Sea, was approved by him in 1994.

He said the radar would have instantly noticed when the plane turned west away from its planned route, and said he could not understand why radar operators were unable to check on the plane's journey.

Mr Anwar also questioned why the 
Malaysian air force had not gone after the plane, and said had concerns 
over the way the hunt for the plane had been carried out in the days 
after it vanished.

'I
 believe the government knows more than us. They have the authority to 
instruct the air force … or Malaysia Airlines,' he told The Daily Telegraph.

Location: Mr Anwar said that the government should not have allowed the international search teams to scour the South China Sea as they would have known the plane was not there

'They are privy to most of
 these missing bits of information critical to our understanding of this
 mysterious disappearance of MH370.'

He said he was unable to comment on a suggestion that the Malaysian authorities knew what had happened to the plane, or whether a terrorist act had been responsible for its disappearance.

But he said that the government should
 not have allowed the international search teams to scour the South 
China Sea as they would have known the plane was not there.

Fading hopes: No trace of the jetliner has been found nearly four weeks after it vanished, and hopes of locating the plane's data recorders before the batteries fail are slim

Search crews are now looking for the aircraft in the Indian Ocean, around 1,100 miles north of Perth,. Australia.

No
 trace of the jetliner has been found nearly four weeks after it 
vanished, and although there is no timeframe for ending the search, 
hopes of locating the plane's data recorders before the batteries fail 
are slim.

Finding the
data recorders, often called the black box, would provide a wealth of information 
about the condition the plane was flying under and the communications or
 sounds in the cockpit.

Desperation: Mr Anwar said families of the 153 Chinese passengers who were on board the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 were correct to seek more information from the Malaysian government

False hope: One government source said authorities could not provide families with information that may not be accurate as it could hinder the investigation

The 
data recorders emit a ping that can be detected by special equipment in 
the immediate vicinity.

But the battery-powered devices stop 
transmitting the pings about 30 days after a crash. Locating the data 
recorders and wreckage after that is possible, but becomes an even more 
daunting task.

Mr Anwar described the Malaysian government's efforts as 'at the least, incompetence, but claimed there was an 'intention to suppress key information'.

Opposition: Mr Anwar was once Malaysia's deputy prime minister but fell out with other members of the government and now heads a pro-democracy group of parties

However, critics of Mr Anwar had said he is trying to exploit the tragedy for his own political purposes.

One
 government source said authorities could not provide families with 
information that may not be accurate as it could hinder the 
investigation as well as giving them false hope. 

Malaysian authorities have not commented on Mr Anwar’s accusations, but previously the country's sports minister Khairy Jamaluddin said he had spoken of pilot Captain Shah's support for his party so he could 'play the victim'.

Denial: Some reports suggested Captain Shah (pictured) may have hijacked the plane, although both his family and Mr Anwah have rejected the claims

Mr Anwar was once Malaysia's deputy prime minister but fell out with other members of the government and now heads a pro-democracy group of parties.

In the country's election last year they won more than 50 per cent of the popular vote, but lost the election - prompting allegations of corruption.

The day before the jetliner went 
missing, Anwar was sentenced to five years in jail for a second sodomy 
offense, preventing him from running in a by-election later this month.

His prosecution on a 
charge of sodomy is seen by many Malaysians as political persecution.

Campaigners
 say the politician, the key challenger to Malaysia’s ruling party, was 
the victim of a long-running smear campaign and had faced trumped-up 
charges.

Captain Shah, a supporter of the pro-democracy coalition, was thought to be 
incensed by the verdict.

Some reports suggested Captain Shah may have hijacked the plane, although both his family and Mr Anwah have rejected the claims.

Mr Anwah said that had the pilot been involved in the aircraft's disappearance, he would have been unable to hide radar readings.

He said: 'To condemn a person because he is a supporter of democracy is totally unjustified. Having said that, there’s nothing stopping the police or the authorities from conducting an open and fair investigation into anybody – including the radar operators, the defence minister – why are they concealing this information?'
