LeBron James was among the Ohio State fans celebrating long into the night after the Buckeyes beat the Oregon Ducks 42-20 in the first ever College Football Play-off National Championship Game in Arlington.

The basketball superstar watched on at the home of the Dallas Cowboys as Ohio State, led by 246 rushing yards and four touchdowns from Ezekiel Elliott, were crowned the best college football team in the country on Monday night.

'This will go down as one of the great stories in college football history,' Ohio State coach Urban Meyer said. '(It's a story of) closeness, selflessness and team.'

Third-string quarterback Cardale Jones was again thrust into the spotlight after injuries to the team's top signal callers, and he shook off his side's four turnovers to throw for 242 yards with one passing score and another on the ground.

Jones stood toe to toe with Oregon's Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback, Marcus Mariota, who threw for 333 yards and two touchdowns in the defeat.

Meyer delivered the national title to the Buckeyes after taking over the program in 2012, and won his third overall following titles with Florida in 2006 in 2008.

Oregon reached the championship game by humbling Florida State 59-20 last week, but the Ducks' fast-paced offense was slowed by the Buckeyes.

After trailing 21-10 at half-time, Mariota launched a 70-yard touchdown pass and Oregon added a field goal to make it 21-20 midway through the third quarter.

Ohio State turned to Elliott to seal the game as he pushed the lead back up with a third-quarter score then added two more in the fourth. The performance was his third straight 200-yard rushing game.

'The offense just started clicking so well and the offensive line stepped up,' Elliott explained. 'It's a surreal moment. We finally did it.'
