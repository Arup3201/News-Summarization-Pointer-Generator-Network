Never mind the World Cup connotations. For now, the bigger picture can remain out of focus, in the background. Friday night it is all about Wales versus England; an annual tribal confrontation that needs no wider significance.

The 2015 edition of the RBS 6 Nations explodes into life under lights and the night sky in Cardiff, with a cross-border grudge match that deserves to be viewed as the be-all and end-all for both competing nations.

When the arch rivals collide at the Millennium Stadium, there will be no thought of tomorrow or the championship title, let alone events to follow later this year.

How the Wales and England packs compare

Few fixtures stir the blood as much as this one, which is why the result’s ramifications for Pool A of the World Cup — where the next encounter will take place in September — is a topic now on hold until the post-match dust has settled.

All that will count amid the maelstrom of a typically fervent atmosphere in the Welsh capital is the here-and-now business of supremacy on the scoreboard. Any other considerations amount to so much hot air.

Both teams have been determined to address this game in isolation and they are absolutely right to do so, knowing that success here will play a part in addressing the bigger picture anyway. There is vast respect for the traditions of this historic sporting duel within both camps.

‘It doesn’t get any better as a set-up to the championship,’ said England head coach Stuart Lancaster, as his men prepared to engage in what they hope will become a ghost-busting exercise.

‘It’s an iconic rugby stadium, it’s an iconic fixture, the history behind the two countries in rugby is huge.’

On behalf of Wales, an English voice struck a similar note, with Shaun Edwards adding: ‘We have always said we are judged on the Six Nations. The big competitions are the Six Nations and the World Cup. The Six Nations is very special and the oldest competition in the world.’

This is a fitting place and contest to launch the latest instalment of European rugby’s blue-riband event. In time, both Wales and England are hell-bent on usurping Ireland as champions, but they will be painfully aware that this fixture has a make-or-break feel to it.

For Lancaster’s regime and for many of the players in white on Friday night, there is a subplot of far more immediate significance than the World Cup. This match represents a shot at redemption in the arena where captain Chris Robshaw and Co were subjected to a record 30-3 defeat in 2013.

All involved in that debacle — which saw Grand Slam hopes blasted to oblivion — are desperate to make amends and that is a powerful motivating force in the visitors’ favour.

Wasps captain James Haskell is one of those who was on duty two years ago and, recalling the bleak episode, the flanker said: ‘I was very frustrated that we didn’t win and get the Grand Slam. The nature of the way we were beaten was disappointing as well.

‘I call it getting caught in the tumble-dryer where you just keep going round and round and there’s no sign of getting out of there. There’s no purple patch — everything is a mistake compounded by a mistake. That’s a sign of a good team inflicting that on another one.

‘We’re in a completely different place this time. We’re a lot more experienced. A couple of years on, the guys have played at that level a lot more. They’ve gone behind to some big southern-hemisphere teams and clawed it back, and other scenarios which can only help keep your head calm.’

Ominously for England, defence coach Shaun Edwards believes Wales are far better equipped for the battle

However, the ominous news for England is that Edwards believes Wales are far better equipped for the battle than they were a year ago, when they were well beaten at Twickenham.

‘We are in a better place than we were this time last year when there was a lot going on,’ he said. ‘I just feel we are more focused this year. We are also healthy, which is a massive factor.’

Certainly, a glance through the line-ups explains just why Wales are considered clear favourites. They are more or less at full strength, many of their leading players are fresh and they will have a roll-call of predatory Lions roaming the relaid turf.

Two years ago, Warren Gatland’s men dashed English dreams with an onslaught founded in part on their superiority at the breakdown, based on the back-row alliance of two specialist opensides, captain Sam Warburton and Justin Tipuric. This time, the latter is in reserve, with Dan Lydiate back at blindside, but Haskell knows that he, Robshaw and their England team-mates again face an arduous task in that pivotal area of combat.

‘As a team we have to be spot on at the breakdown,’ he said. ‘We’re all aware of the threat posed by Lydiate’s ability to tackle low and Warburton coming over the ball. That’s going to be a very hot area for us. The team that gets the upper hand there will go well.’

England are weakened by injuries, but remain strong, especially up front. Edwards was right to note: ‘England are the envy of the world when it comes to tight-five forwards.’ The intrigue will be to see whether a side with ample clout in the pack opt to adopt an arm-wrestle approach or stay true to the attacking instincts of their playmaker, George Ford, and seek to cut loose at times. If so, the onus will be on recalled Bath centre Jonathan Joseph to provide the spark in wider channels.

Welsh experience is a valuable asset and Lancaster has been so alert to the issue that he has summoned Haskell and Dan Cole to start, plus Tom Croft and 36-year-old Nick Easter to take places on the bench, to provide some English nous and know-how. Composure in the cauldron will be a crucial factor, not least for the goal-kickers.

Ford will need to be at the peak of his powers to match the relentlessly clinical Leigh Halfpenny. Dylan Hartley, the visitors’ hooker, is another who will have to keep his head, to avoid providing the Welsh hot-shot with ammunition and spending any more time in sin-bins or disciplinary hearings.

Even if England are clear-headed and precise, it may not be enough. Wales are favourites for a reason. They have the edge in big-match pedigree, and they will have the Cardiff cacophony at their backs.

A home win is the most likely outcome. What that would mean in the long run, only time will tell.
