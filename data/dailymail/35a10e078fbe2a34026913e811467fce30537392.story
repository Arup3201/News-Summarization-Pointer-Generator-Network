Police want to question new suspect in the murder of a 57-year-old businessman who was found dead in his New York City home last Friday night.

Surveillance video shows victim John Laubach being escorted into his apartment by two men Friday night, sources told the New York Post.

One man was called in for questioning yesterday morning but was released without charge. The other man, sources say, is still at large, and so is Mr Laubach’s laptop.

Suspect: Cops are looking to question this man in connection to the Chelsea slaying of a floral designer

John Laubach, 57, who was well known for carrying a parrot on his shoulder, was found bound and gagged in his apartment on Friday

Known in the Chelsea neighbourhood 
for carrying his parrot Bolo on his shoulder, Laubach was tied to a 
bedpost with an electrical cord.

He was found by a female friend with his
 hands and feet bound and duct tape over his mouth in what may have been
 a sexual tryst gone wrong.

The home had been ransacked, but police found no signs of forced entry.

Sources told the New York Post that Mr 
Laubach often met young men for sex and cops are investigating whether 
his death was part of a sex game gone wrong.

Mr Laubach, who had been running his own floral design business since 2000, was wearing just a white undershirt and his face was covered with a towel.

A female friend had gone to Laubach’s fourth floor apartment in West 22nd Street to check on him after he failed to answer her calls.

She called 911 just before 8pm after making the grim discovery.

'I always saw him walking around with a parrot on his shoulder,' a neighbor told the Post. 'He looked like Mel Brooks - just better looking.'

His parrot was heard squawking in his apartment for several hours before the discovery of his body.

Sources said the Maryland native, who moved to the building after selling his Fifth Avenue apartment in 2010 for  $650,000, was formerly a company CEO and had business interests overseas, according to the Post.

He was in poor health, having suffered two strokes in the past.

Laubach was a committed churchgoer, according to those who knew him, and often volunteered to help out at services.

Bob Clemens, 57, who lived in the same building, told the Post that Mr Laubach and a female friend had a close relationship.

'They went to church every Sunday. They came to my Christmas party. They were totally cool and fun,' he said.

Other locals recall him sitting on a bench near his apartment with the parrot on his shoulder.

Mr Laubach’s former neighbors on Fifth Avenue described him as an outgoing person who had frequent male visitors, and regularly attended a nearby church.
