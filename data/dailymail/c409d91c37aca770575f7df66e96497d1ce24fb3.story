Seattle Seahawks fans set a Guiness World Record for the loudest stadium last night during the game against San Francisco's 49ers.

The group, called Volume 12, announced on its Facebook page it had set the mark late in the first quarter.

The decibel reading taken during a sack of San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick in the first quarter — following a one hour weather delay — was 131.9 decibels.

The previous record for 'loudest crowd roar at a sports stadium', was 131.76 decibels, set in 2011 in Turkey at the Ali Sami Yen Sport Complex Turk Telekom Arena during a soccer match between Galatasaray SC and Fenerbahce.

The group footed the bill for the Guinness World Records official to come to Seattle and wasn't affiliated with the team.

Meanwhile, Seattle Seahawks corner back Richard Sherman celebrated by dancing with cheerleaders, Marshawn Lynch cut, plowed and strolled his way to three touchdowns, and Pete Carroll got a rousing birthday gift.

But the highly anticipated NFC West showdown between the Seahawks and 49ers was a one-sided rout.

Lynch scored on runs of 14 and 2 yards, and added a 7-yard touchdown reception in the second half, Seattle flustered Colin Kaepernick into his worst passing game as a starter, and the Seahawks dominated in a 29-3 win last night.
