When sending a text or instant message, sometimes words just aren’t enough and that’s where emoticons come in.

On Twitter, users can already track how many of these emoticons from the emoji list of designs are tweeted every second, using Emoji Tracker.

And now a developer has taken the most popular designs and plotted them on a globe to see these emojis being tweeted worldwide, in real time.

The Silicon Feelings globe, pictured, was created by Dallas developer Bradley Griffith. It shows the most popular 400 emojis, according to website Emoji Tracker, that are being posted on Twitter in real time. Griffith said only tweets that contain geolocation data appear

A study in April found that the top trending word of the year, so far, 
is emoji – the small digital images used to express an idea or emotion 
in electronic communication - which are continuing to spread like 
wildfire online.

The words and phrases were plucked from among millions used online in social media, blogs and global media.

Other terms to make the list include 'futebol’, and 'ghost plane' - relating to the 
missing Malaysia Airlines plane.

The Silicon Feelings project was built by Dallas Developer Bradley Griffith.

He used the Emoji Tracker, which highlights the use of the emoticons on Twitter, to find the 400 most commonly used designs – out of a list of approximately 800.

These include smiley faces, winking faces, love hearts, food items, travel-related emojis, and more.

But, because so many emoticons are tweeted every second – so much so, Emoji Tracker comes with an epilepsy warning – Griffith chose to only plot the tweets that contain geolocation data.

This means a user has opted in to reveal their location each time they tweet.

The globe spins slowly on its axis 
around the equator, but clicking the image and dragging it with the 
mouse cursor lets viewers pinpoint particular countries and regions.

It was built predominantly using javascript and WebGL.

The
 Earth textures were created by designer Tom Patterson at 
Shadedrelief.com, while the font is called Rayon and was created by Sergey 
Yakunin.

High-resolution emoji images were then taken from Greaterweb.

Griffith explained: ‘I'm a developer and wannabe designer currently living in Dallas.

‘I
 released Silicon Feelings as a small offering to the internet and 
effort to learn some technologies I've been meaning to learn.'

Emoji were originally popular in Japan, and widely used online. However, in recent years they have become hugely popular elsewhere.

Originally meaning pictograph, the word emoji literally means 'picture'
 (e) + 'letter' (moji).

Icons
 are standardised and include some specific to Japanese culture, such as
 a bowing (apologising) businessman, a face wearing a face mask, a white
 flower used to denote 'brilliant homework' or a group of emoji 
representing popular foods: ramen noodles, dango, onigiri, Japanese 
curry, and sushi.

Some 
emoji character sets have been incorporated into Unicode, allowing them 
to be used elsewhere in the world - and more could now be added.

Twitter allowed emoji to be used on its web version, as well across its apps, last month.
