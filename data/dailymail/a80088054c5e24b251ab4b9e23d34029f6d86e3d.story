The suspect arrested in an early morning robbery in Seattle on Tuesday led police to where he'd stashed the stolen cash:

Between his buttocks. 

The unnamed 42-year-old's loot eluded officers during a pat down and he was taken all the way back to the precinct before the truth came out.

After revealing where he'd stashed it, the man kindly reached around and retrieved two $20 bills.

A 42-year-old suspected mugger led police to where he hid the loot from an early morning stick-up outside a Seattle gas station on Tuesday: between his buttocks

He was booked on robbery charges and a theft warrant, reports KIRO.

The thief had pulled a knife on his victim in front of a Shell gas station in the city's Capitol Hill neighborhood at the corner of Broadway and East Pike Street.

The knife was recovered and the victim was not reported to have been harmed.

However, a knife attack across town didn't have such a humorous ending last month when a 65-year-old employee at a Georgetown neighborhood gas station was savagely stabbed at New Year's.

The attendant was rushed to a hospital after a customer called 911 upon fining him unconscious and bleeding from the face on the floor, the Seattle Times reported. 

Two men would subsequently be arrested in connection with the crime.

The knife wounds--which numbered 11 in total to his face and eyes--left him completely blind.
