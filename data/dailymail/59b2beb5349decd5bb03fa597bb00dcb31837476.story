MPs are demanding a bigger expenses bill so they can live in some of London’s most expensive districts – and avoid using public transport.

Generous rules already allow MPs to claim £20,000 to rent a second home but some are complaining it is not enough to fund ‘suitable’ accommodation close to Westminster.

Officials at the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) insisted ‘MPs should, where possible, be treated in the same manner as other citizens’ but is now considering increasing the rent limits so MPs can live within walking distance of the Houses of Parliament.

MPs say they should be able to claim expenses to live within walking distance of the Houses of Parliament, so they do not have to use public transport late at night

Critics said Westminster is one of the most expensive places to live in the country, and hard-pressed taxpayers should not have to foot the bill to make life easier for MPs.

Public anger over MPs expense threatens to erupt again after details of their landlords were published. At least eight are renting flats from other MPs, peers or ex-MPs who continue to benefit from the taxpayer despite no longer being in the Commons.

Of 320 MPs who claim expenses for renting in London, 51 successfully blocked details of their landlord being made public. Those affected include Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg, former Labour Cabinet minister John Denham and Nadine Dorries, who has been suspended from the Tory party for taking part in I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here.

It also emerged that former dfence minister Sir Peter Luff is renting a London flat from Chelsea footballer Frank Lampard.

Now MPs have complained to IPSA that its rules insisting they can use public transport like everyone else are unfair.

They
 have suggested their desire to live close to Parliament, the London Eye
 and Trafalgar Square is movtivated by ‘security concerns’

IPSA
 said: ‘Some MPs who rent in London have raised concerns that they have 
difficulty finding suitable rental accommodation close to Westminster 
within the annual Accommodation budget. 

‘Some
 of these MPs wish to live in flats which are within a short walking 
distance of Westminster, citing reasons such as security concerns 
(particularly when there have been late sittings of the House of 
Commons) and the need to live in a convenient location because of the 
unpredictability of parliamentary business.’

However, from this year the Commons now only sits late on Mondays, starting at 2.30pm and finishing at 10.30pm. Late sittings on Tuesdays have been dropped and the Commons now begins business at 11.30am, rising at 7.30pm.

IPSA rules state that the expense regime is ‘designed to support the renting of a property which is within reasonable travelling distance of Westminster’. 

‘It is not calculated on the basis of walking distance from Westminster,’ IPSA adds.  ‘Working on the presumption that in matters relating to expenses, MPs should be treated in the same manner as other citizens, the IPSA Board has taken the view that it is appropriate for MPs to use transport to get to work, in common with members of the public.’

Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘MPs already get substantial living allowances, so it’s not right that some have approached Ipsa to see if they can have more taxpayers’ money to move within walking distance of the House.

‘That will mean much more expensive bills for hard-pressed families as rental costs in Westminster are some of the most expensive in the country.’
