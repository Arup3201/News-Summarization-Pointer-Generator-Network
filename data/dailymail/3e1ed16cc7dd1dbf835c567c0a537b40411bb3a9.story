Mexican police and soldiers apprehended Wednesday the notorious Zetas drug cartel leader Omar Trevino Morales, alias 'Z-42,' a federal official said.

The official, who was not authorized to be quoted by name due to government policy, said Trevino Morales, 41, was arrested in a pre-dawn raid in San Pedro Garza Garcia, a wealthy suburb of the northern city of Monterrey.

The Mexican government had offered a $2million reward for his capture on weapons and organized crime charges.

The US Drug Enforcement Administration, which had Morales on its 'Most Wanted' list, had offered a $5million reward for his capture on cocaine-trafficking charges.

Trevino may also face charges for several abductions and murders. 

Trevino's give name is Alejandro, but he has had multiple aliases and nicknames, including 'Omar,' '42' and 'Commandante 42.' 

The arrest of Morales comes just days after the capture of Servando 'La Tuta' Gomez, leader of the Knights Templar drug gang, who was the the most wanted capo still at large in Mexico.

The suspect is the brother of Miguel Angel Trevino Morales, described as the most bloodthirsty leader of Mexico's most violent organized crime group. 

Miguel Angel was arrested in July 2013, almost a year after marines killed the Zetas' other biggest leader, Heriberto Lazcano 'El Lazca.'

‘Omar Trevino was the heir to all the Zetas who were going down,’ said Raul Benitez, a security expert at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. 

The Zetas carved a path of brutality, bloodshed and mutilated bodies across northern Mexico during their turf battles with the rival Gulf cartel, claiming upwards of 100,000 lives since 2007.

Among the most notorious incidents attributed to Los Zetas are the massacres of dozens of migrant workers, an arson attack on a Monterrey casino in 2011 that killed 52 and the dumping of 49 decapitated bodies near the same city in 2012.

Once the flashpoint for the worst of the violence, security in northern Mexico has improved considerably, except for the lawless northeastern border state of Tamaulipas, said Raul Benitez.

Founded in the late 1990s by deserters from an elite Mexican army unit, the Zetas initially acted as enforcers for the powerful Gulf cartel, based along the border with Texas and one of the oldest criminal syndicates in Mexico.

But the group struck out on its own in early 2010, setting off the most violent phase in Mexico's drug war.
