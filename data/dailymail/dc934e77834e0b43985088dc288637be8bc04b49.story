Luis Suarez is 90 minutes from his first final with Barcelona but his coach Luis Enrique could leave him out of the Copa del Rey semi-final second leg against Villarreal because he is one booking away from suspension.

Suarez has now scored five goals in his last five games but Pedro, Neymar and Messi could start the match if the Barcelona manager decides he wants his £75million striker saved for the final and not exposed to the risk of a yellow card that would rule him out of it.

Barcelona will have reached their 38th Spanish Cup final if they can take the 3-1 first leg result over the line. No club in Spain has made it to more  finals or won the competition more often than their 26 trophies.

Villarreal have never made it to a big final and supporters were preparing for what will be one of the greatest nights in their history with yellow balloons placed on all the seats of the 20,000 El Madrigal stadium.

The last time they came close to reaching a final was 2005 when Manuel Pellegrini was in charge. They lost 1-0 to Arsenal in their Champions League semi-final first leg and won a last-gasp penalty in the second game only for Jens Lehman to save Juan Roman Riquelme’s spot-kick and prevent the game going into extra time. 

They reached the Europa League semi-final in 2010 but were beaten 5-1 in the first leg, with Radamel Falcao scoring four and making the second game an irrelevance.

A 2-0 win would see them go through on Wednesday but Barcelona have not failed to score in a Cup game since the 2010-11 Copa del Rey final against Jose Mourinho’s Real Madrid. Since then they have scored in 33 cup games. Villarreal will probably need to score three. 

They are at least buoyed by drawing with Real Madrid at the weekend. ‘You don’t win these games playing with your heart, you win them by being smart,’ said Villarreal coach Marcelino on Tuesday.

He has La Liga’s hottest young striker at his disposal in the shape of Luciano Vietto, who has scored 18 goals in all competitions this season and weighed in with 13 assists. His agent Jorge Cyerszpiler – who was Diego Maradona’s first agent – was talking up his client's fondness for Real Madrid in the lead up to this game.

Diego Simeone is a massive fan and wants the player at Atletico Madrid next season, while Liverpool lead a clutch of Premier League clubs who are keeping a close eye on the latest South American talent discovered by Villarreal. 

They are determined not to let their player leave for anything less than €30m and they want to see the 21-year-old help them to their first ever final before they even consider his possible departure.
