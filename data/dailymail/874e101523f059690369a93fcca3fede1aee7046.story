Comedy duo Wallace and Gromit will star in a £4 million ad campaign to show off the best of Britain this Summer.

In an effort to boost UK tourism, the beloved animated characters will visit top UK destinations on their holidays.

Wallace and Gromit are seen traveling the country, finding fun at York Castle, Stonehenge and the Tower of London.

The advert will be shown in cinemas and on television as part of 'Holidays at Home are GREAT' campaign, which starts this Sunday.

It is not known how much of the £4million budget was spent commissioning Wallace and Gromit creator Nick Park, 54.

He told the Sun: 'A nice cup of tea and some tasty local cheese is always a favourite, so they won't be disappointed with their holidays in the UK'

It aims to encourage people to holiday at home, to raise £80 million in additional tourism spend and more than a million overnight stays.

VisitEngland chief executive James Berresford said: 'Wallace and Gromit are wonderful ambassadors for holidays at home.

'They are a quintessentially English 
double-act with universal appeal at home and abroad, and I’m sure they 
will capture the public’s imagination.'
