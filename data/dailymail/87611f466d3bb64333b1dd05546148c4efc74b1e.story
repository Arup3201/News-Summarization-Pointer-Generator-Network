Luxury label Issa - loved by the likes of the Duchess of Cambridge, Cara Delevingne and Samantha Cameron - announced earlier this year that it would be collaborating with Banana Republic on an affordable high-street line. 

Last week we had a sneak peek of the collaboration's take on the swishy blue silk wrap dress that Kate wore when her engagement news was delivered to the world in late 2010.

And now, FEMAIL brings you a look at the 40-piece collection with Banana Republic, designed for fashion fanatics hoping to get a touch of the Issa magic for less.

Available from between £25 and £100 per piece, the new collection is much more modestly priced than Issa's high end collections - but it still offers the Brazilian-born label's signature wrap dresses, albeit with a high street twist.

Boho babe: The boho-inspired line has been created so that copy-Kates can get her look for less (both dresses £75)

Launching on 8 August, the line will be carried in 700 stores globally, as well as online.

The line features kimono, wrap-tie and pleated dresses in patterns and block colours.

There are also plenty of wrap-tie blouses in a range of vibrant colours, chunky knits for winter, as well as range of jewellery and accessories.

Speaking about the collaboration, Simon
 Kneen of Banana Republic told WWD: 'We always love animal prints such as zebra and 
giraffe stripes.

'Issa took that and modernised it. I love that the collection is our world and their world.'

The fun
 campaign video, which has been unveiled today, shows a
blonde model dancing in and out of a wardrobe wearing a different 
wrap-dress design each time.

She then
 tries to impress a band of Buckingham Palace style guards by prancing 
around them in her stylish dresses, even kissing one on the cheek.

Celebrity favourite: Cara Delevingne loves the label and Michelle Williams was spotted out and about this week wearing the red and purple printed dress (L, £75, R, £85)

Expanding: Camilla Al Fayed decided to buy a majority stake in the company and is now spearheading their global expansion, which looks set to do very well if their latest collaboration is anything to go by (L-£75, R-£85)

Prints: The boho-inspired line features kimono, wrap-tie and pleated dresses in patterns and block colours (L-65, R-£85)

The brand, which was already a huge success at London Fashion Week and in certain social circles, went global when Kate wore her £500 Issa wrap dress for her engagement announcement in 2010.

It sparked one of the first of many 'Kate Middleton fashion frenzies' and put the label even more firmly on the style map.

Both Cara Delevingne and Jourdan Dunn walked in the Issa catwalk earlier this year, and while designers were bending over backwards to get model-of-the-moment Cara 
on their catwalk during London Fashion Week, she said she wanted to walk
 for Issa because its bohemian style was right up her street.

However, Issa's founder Daniella Helayel has since parted ways with the company, two years after Camilla Al Fayed bought a majority 
stake in the company and spearheaded their global expansion project.
