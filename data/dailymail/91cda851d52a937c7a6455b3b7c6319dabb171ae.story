Manchester United are on the trail of teenage French striker Yassin Fortune.

Club scouts watched on as the 16-year-old from Lens scored for France Under 16s against Switzerland on Wednesday in their 2-1 win at St George's Park.

United are due to watch him again on Saturday when Fortune, who turned 16 in January, lines up against England.

Fortune, who plays for Lens Under 19s, has the same agent as Timothy Fosuh-Mensah who signed for United from Ajax last year.

It's clear the United recruitment is currently focused on youth as Louis van Gaal's side have also signed promising Belgian teenager Indy Boonen on a three-year deal.

Sportsmail reported in December that United were interested in the 16-year-old attacking midfielder, who can also play as a left back, as well as his brother Seppe, a 13-year-old goalkeeper.

Boonen, who has been on trial at Carrington for the past month, can sign professional terms now he has turned 16.
