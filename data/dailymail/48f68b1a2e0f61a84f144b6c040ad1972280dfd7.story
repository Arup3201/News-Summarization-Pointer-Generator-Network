An NFL Hall of Famer has been reunited with his treasured Super Bowl ring 21 years after it was stolen from him.

Lance Alworth, now 73, won the ring back in 1972 when he played for the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl VI.

The Cowboys beat the Miami Dolphins, 24-3, in New Orleans and Alworth caught a touchdown pass.Â

Last month Alworth had received a phone call demanding $40,000 for the ring. He contacted the San Diego County Sheriff's Department in Encinitas who ensured that it was returned to him.

No arrests have been made and the investigation has been turned over to the district attorney's office for review.

The ring was reported stolen in 1992 from a San Diego bar that displayed sports memorabilia.

Former wide receiver Alworth spent most of his career with the San Diego Chargers but his final two seasons with the Cowboys.
