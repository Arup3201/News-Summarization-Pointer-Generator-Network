The first weekend of the Premier League is done and dusted and, largely true to form, the usual suspects of Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool already occupy the top four spots.

And with the opening games come debuts, and plenty of them, as every club in the top flight featured at least one summer acquisition in their starting line-up.

But how did did they all get on? Here, Sportsmail ranks the top 10 who impressed on their first Premier League appearances for their new clubs...

10

Brede Hangeland

Team: Crystal Palace

Cost: Free

His Eagles debut ended in defeat against Arsenal. But his performance at the Emirates Stadium made for encouraging viewing for Palace fans. Not only his goal, but the way he handled Arsenal's lively attacking unit bodes well for Palace's attempts to stay in the Barclays Premier League.

Big man: Brede Hangeland was an imposing presence in the heart of Crystal Palace's defence against Arsenal

9

Leonardo Ulloa

Team: Leicester

Cost: £8m

Foxes boss Nigel Adkins has decided to put his faith in the Argentinian striker - a man who has no Premier League experience - in Leicester's top-flight return. His capture has raised a few eyebrows but what better way to answer your critics than a debut goal. And the striker did just that, scoring his new side's first goal of the season in the draw against Everton. Could be a snip at £8m.

Joy: Leonardo Ulloa celebrates scoring on his Leicester and Premier League debut against Everton

8

Andrew Robertson

Team: Hull

Cost: £2.85m

Perhaps the player with the lowest profile on this list, but if he puts in more performances like his one against Queens Park Rangers on Saturday then that won't last long. The young Scot was playing for Queens Park two years ago, on Saturday he was lining up against Rio Ferdinand. And the occasion didn't get to the left-wing back one little bit.

7

Fernando

Team: Manchester City

Cost: £12m

Not the most explosive of debuts but he was extremely effective in the Barclays Premier League champions' win over Newcastle on Sunday. He showed a great understanding of the game, sniffing out danger in front of his back-four. Manuel Pellegrini has been on Fernando's case since the back end of last year, on Sunday we caught a glimpse of why.

Power player: Fernando was a force in midfield for Manchester City as they outplayed Newcastle

6

Dusan Tadic

Team: Southampton

Cost: £10.9m

The Serbian is essentially Adam Lallana's replacement at St Mary's and maybe, just maybe, the Saints will not miss the England midfielder as much as they thought they might. Technically Tadic looks on point. He also looks to have the X-factor, too - his back heel to set up Nathaniel Clyne's goal against Liverpool was one of the highlights of the weekend.

Nice tough: Dusan Tadic showed glimpses of being the player who could replace Adam Lallana at Southampton

5

Calum Chambers

Team: Arsenal

Cost: £16m

The 19-year-old looked like he'd been a Premier League centre-back for 10 years against Crystal Palace on Saturday. Composed, comfortable on the ball and strong in the tackle, the teenager has all the hallmarks of an England regular in the making. The fact he broke through at Southampton as right-back makes his rapid transition inside even more impressive.

Composed: Calum Chambers started at the heart of Arsenal's defence against Crystal Palace

4 

Diego Costa

Team: Chelsea

Cost: £32m

When you cost as much as Diego Costa does then you have no option but to hit the ground running. And the Spain international showed exactly why Jose Mourinho splashed so much on him by scoring on his debut. There'll be tougher opponents for Costa this season, but he's already off to a flier.

Impact: Diego Costa may prove to be the missing link in Chelsea's attack this season following his arrival

3 

Cesc Fabregas

Team: Chelsea

Cost: £30m

Arsenal and Manchester United supporters look away now. Yes, it is just one game. Yes, it's against Burnley (no disrespect!) but Fabregas was sensational at Turf Moor. He knows exactly what the Premier League is all about so there'll be no problems with him adapting. Remains one of the world's best centre-midfielders despite his struggles at Barcelona.

Class touch: Cesc Fabregas assisted two goals on his return to the Premier League against Burnley

2

Eric Dier

Team: Tottenham

Cost: £4m

Perhaps not the most glamorous of summer signings but he is already a fans favourite amongst the White Hart Lane faithful following his injury time winner against arch-rivals West Ham. His versatility will be huge asset for Spurs this season. Looks a shrewd signing by Mauricio Pochettino.

Announcement: Eric Dier scored a last-gaps winner for Tottenham as they beat West Ham on Saturday

1

Gylfi Sigurdsson

Team: Swansea

Cost: Undisclosed

Okay, he's played for Swansea before, but what a way to re-announce yourself to the club's fans. It doesn't get much better than scoring on your (second) debut, but not only that, scoring the winner at Old Trafford in Louis van Gaal's first game in charge. Swans boss Garry Monk was desperate to bring the Icelandic midfielder back to the club, it's not hard to see why.

Return: Gylfi Sigurdsson scored the winner at Old Trafford in his first game back for Swansea
