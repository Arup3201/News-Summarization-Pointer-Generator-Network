Almost a winner: Auburn alum Mark Skiba bet $100 on Auburn to win at 500/1 odds, they led after the third quarter but ultimately lost the game

An Auburn fan almost won more than $50,000 for placing a bet on Monday's BCS National Title game before the teams playing in it were even decided.

Mark Skiba bet on December 1 $100 that Auburn would win the BCS Title Game at 
500/1 odds - the payout would have been $50,100 if the Tigers had won. But his chances were dashed after Florida State University scored the go-ahead touchdown to put FSU up 34-31 with only 13 seconds remaining.

Mr
 Skiba graduated from Auburn in 1998, and had previously won a bet on 
them winning the national title in 2010, according to Fox Sports.

He placed the bet on tonight's game on Dec 1, before it was even known if Auburn would be in the national title game.

The Auburn alum did not win the $50,100, but he did collect $2,000 earlier in the game - so it wasn't a total loss.

'I caught FSU at Even money early in the game for $2K,' he wrote on Twitter. 'So that should make some of you feel better.'

Jameis Winston, Florida State's Heisman Trophy winning quarterback had other ideas though.

He threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Kelvin
Benjamin with 13 seconds left and No. 1 Florida State beat No. 2 Auburn 34-31
to win the last BCS National Championship game on Monday night.

The winning toss capped a tumultuous 12 months that saw him face rape allegations, 
win the Heisman Trophy as college football's best player and go undefeated to win the college 
football championship.

The clinching catch: Florida State Seminoles Kelvin Benjamin (C) catches the game winning touchdown pass while being covered by Auburn Tigers Chris Davis (L) in the fourth quarter

Mr Winston struggled much of the night but was near perfect
when the Seminoles (14-0) needed it most, going 6 for 7 for 77 yards on the
game-winning 80-yard drive.

A pass interference penalty on Auburn's Chris Davis
gave Florida State a first-and-goal at the 2 and on the next play Winston hit
his big receiver for the touchdown.

'I said this from Day 1 in spring ball. These kids are
special,' coach Jimbo Fisher said. 'This group never faltered. They
wanted to be elite. They wanted to go to the top and there's so much character
in this group.'

Tre Mason had given Auburn (12-2) a 31-27 lead with a
37-yard touchdown run with 1:19 left after Kermit Whitfield had put Florida
State in the lead for the first time since the first quarter with a 100-yard
kickoff return to make it 27-24 with 4:31 left.

Mason ran for 195 yards.

Winston was 20 for 35 for 237 yards and two fourth-quarter
touchdown passes.

The perfect birthday present: Mr Winston lifts The Coaches' Trophy while surrounded by teammates after the NCAA BCS National Championship Game

Nick Marshall ran for a touchdown and threw scoring passes
to Mason and Melvin Ray in the first half, and Auburn led 21-13 after three
quarters.

It was after that third quarter that a picture of a betting slip began circulating around Twitter.

All-America kicker Roberto Aguayo's second field goal of the
night accounted for the only third-quarter points for either team as both
defenses took charge after a frenetic first half.

The powerful Seminoles trailed by 18 points in the second
quarter and 21-10 at halftime, but picked up momentum in the third quarter with
solid defensive play and improvements by Winston, who was fighting a case of
big-game jitters.

Uncertain future: Where Mr Winston goes from here is anybody's guess - he has suitors in both Major League Baseball and the NFL

The Heisman Trophy-winning freshman went 6 for 15 for 62
yards in the first half on his birthday, with a key fumble setting up
Marshall's 4-yard TD run 5:01 before halftime.

Mr Winston also led a 66-yard
scoring drive late in the first half and consistently moved Florida State in
the third quarter â€” but with only three points to show for it.

After trailing for the first time in any game since Sept.
28, Florida State needed a big finish to become the first team to rally from a
halftime deficit to win the BCS title game.

The end of the season brings a host of questions for the embattled, and battle-tested, FSU quarterback.

Will he stay in college or declare himself eligible for the NFL Draft? He is not assured of being a number one pick when going up against Alabama's QB AJ McCarron or Texas A&M's Johnny Manziel - should he also declare.

The perfect setting: The BCS National Championship was played at the Rose Bowl, in Pasadena, California

Will the rape allegations from last year hurt his draft stock? That cloud may never lift from Mr Winston's head, and time will only tell how NFL teams feel about his character when making draft picks when Mr Winston does decide to go pro.

Will he also pursue a baseball career? The Texas Rangers have been adamant about signing the two sport collegiate star and developing him in the mold of famous two sport stars Bo Jackson and Deion Sanders.

The challenge to Mr Winston being a two sport star is that neither Mr Jackson nor Mr Sanders was a quarterback, as the Dallas Morning News noted.

But Mr Winston seems undeterred.

'I want to be better than Bo Jackson,' Mr Winston told reporters in New York before receiving the Heisman last month, according to the paper. 'Of course, I want to keep doing both. Thatâ€™s my dream.'

His stock may never be higher, but that doesn't mean he's ready to bolt FSU's Tallahassee campus just yet.

One thing is certain, he can't defend his BCS title because college football is moving to a playoff system next season.
