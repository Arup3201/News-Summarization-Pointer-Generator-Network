Travellers at an illegal site in Essex have erected a second watchtower today as the battle lines are drawn in their fight against eviction.

Residents at the Dale Farm site have also strengthened other parts of the site after they lost an 11th hour legal challenge yesterday to halt the eviction.

The moves have heightened fears that there will be a violent outcome to the dispute, which has lasted for ten years.

Look out: This second watchtower was constructed today by travellers at the camp as they tried to avoid eviction

Resistance: The Dale Farm travellers say that they won't go quietly if police move in and have begun to barricade the entrances in Crays Hill, Essex. Many locals fear the situation will turn ugly

Aerial photos of the site at Crays Hill also appear to show that large parts of the area are already unoccupied, sparking fears the travellers could end up being evicted only to move 50 yards down the road.

One anarchist who has joined the travellers at the site said:  'There is no way we are leaving them here 
to be attacked by the thugs who pass themselves off as bailiffs.

'Yes, we are preparing for battle and want here to be our fortress - What other option have these people been left with?

'A life in supermarket carparks is no future for these good people.'

Earlier today, Basildon Council 
leader Tony Ball made a last ditch appeal for the 1,000 or so travellers
to leave peacefully, and avoid the need for bailiffs to move in.

Mr Ball said: 'I am making a final appeal to the residents to leave Dale Farm peacefully.

'I
would also ask any visitors to the site or anyone who truly has the 
travellers' interests at heart to urge them to do this as well.

Big issue: Dale Farm is the largest Romany Gypsy and Irish Traveller site in the UK

'Direct action to clear Dale Farm is a last resort for the council and we take it reluctantly - but after almost 10 years of legal wrangling, the travellers have left us with absolutely no choice.

'This settlement has been illegally developed on greenbelt land. By doing this and failing to comply with various enforcement notices over a period of years, the travellers have broken the law.

'By taking this action we are not discriminating against the people on Dale Farm - we are treating them the same as we would any other resident in the local area who built on or developed greenbelt land without permission.

'We now have a difficult operation which we will carry out in a safe and lawful fashion.

Protest: The residents of Dale Farm say the eviction is a massive waste of public money and that they will put up resistance if police try to force them out

Evictions: Resident Mary Flynn talks to reporters at Dale Farm where local authorities will be clearing their homes

Save our homes: Patrick Sheridan, aged seven, poses in his Power Rangers' outfit at the entrance to Camp Constant at Dale Farm where his family will soon be moved on from

'We will continue to offer housing 
assistance to those who may become homeless as a result of the clearance
and we will work closely with other agencies such as the NHS to provide
necessary support for the more vulnerable members of the community 
during the operation.

He added that action will only take place after the travellers have been informed of the date of the operation.

For a number of months now the site – which the travellers bought
and then built on without planning permission – had already been 
fortified in an attempt to deter forced removals.

Officers believe these fortifications 
are now being strengthened. There is barbed wire and scaffolding at the 
perimeter and guarded gateways.

High-pressure canisters have been stockpiled which could be detonated, causing serious injury or even death.

Large tyres have been placed at 
strategic points as barriers – although it is believed these will be 
doused with petrol and set alight.

Travellers had already threatened all-out war if anyone tried to evict them.

An Essex police source said: ‘Up to 
2,000 people from 30 different groups could turn up, according to 
intelligence from a number of sources including social networking 
websites.

‘The residents of Dale Farm won’t be 
able to control these groups. Some are getting worried about that. There
is anxiety that they have created a monster they cannot control. I 
think some people will come to Dale Farm who will be intent on 
violence.’

A traveller living on one of the 
legal plots next to the farm said he feared that the protest could be 
hijacked by the anarchists and other outsiders.

‘It’s your right to defend your home 
but that’s not what these people are here for,’ he said. ‘I don’t want 
them here and others think the same.’

The 50 who have already made their 
way to the sprawling green belt site have set up their headquarters on a
plot referred to as Camp Constant.

One is understood to have worn a 
balaclava throughout a meeting with police to protect his identity in a 
disturbing echo of the way troublemakers disguised themselves at the 
student protests earlier this year and the recent countrywide looting 
and rioting.

Unconfirmed reports suggested UK 
Uncut, whose members occupied Fortnum and Mason in Piccadilly in March 
as violent groups split from a peaceful march against cuts, could be 
among them.

Conservative MP Priti Patel, who 
represents Withan in Essex, said: ‘This is yet another example of the 
political Left encouraging law-breaking and shows they are out of touch 
with all the local communities in Essex who have been affected by 
illegal traveller sites.

‘We need to see strong action taken 
to protect families living near these sites, not Left-wingers trawling 
the bottom of the barrel to find spurious excuses for them to stay.’

Basildon District Council has spent 
ten years trying to remove around 500 travellers from Dale Farm after 
they settled beside dozens of legal plots.

It ended up in the Court of Appeal 
last year when 80 families on 52 plots were ordered to leave. The 
council issued a 28-day notice to leave the camp which expired at 
midnight last night. It said it would be ‘checking compliance’ in the 
coming days.

But police insiders fear that when 
council-appointed bailiffs arrive it will either trigger bloodshed or 
lead to a lengthy stand-off.

Vanessa Redgrave, 74, the actress and
prominent Left-wing campaigner, was among supporters at the High Court 
yesterday as the travellers made a last-ditch attempt to stop the 
eviction. But the action failed.

The case hinged on the treatment of 
72-year-old site resident Mary Flynn, who suffers from breathing 
problems and uses an electric nebuliser.

Mr Justice Kenneth Parker said Court 
of Appeal proceedings, which considered human rights law and concluded 
the council’s decision to evict was legal, was of ‘crucial 
significance’.

Miss Redgrave visited the camp on 
Tuesday to praise the ‘strong, wise, warm and gentle community’ and say 
she hoped ‘humanity would triumph’.
