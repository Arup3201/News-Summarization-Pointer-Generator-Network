The father who raised over $500,000 to help raise his Down syndrome son after claiming his wife abandoned the little boy because of the 'shame' he brought on her family, was previously charged with assaulting his first wife's father, it has been reported.

Almost 18,000 people donated money to Samuel Forrest who said he was trying to bring his son Leo to his native New Zealand after his wife, Ruzan Badalyan, filed for divorce just one week after their son's birth in Armenia on January 21.

Earlier this month, it was revealed Mr Forrest travelled to Armenia four years ago after divorcing and his first wife Kylie Forrest, and losing contact with the three daughters and one son they had together in Whanganui on New Zealand's north island.

Reports have now emerged that in March of 2010, Mr Forrest - who has not yet left Armenia - was fined $530 after being convicted of assaulting his then father-in-law before he fled the country, according to The New Zealand Herald.

Samuel Forrest, who  split from his wife just a week after their son Leo was born with Down syndrome in Armenia on January 21, was convicted of assaulting his first wife's father in 2010 

A former housemate of Mr Forrest's told the newspaper: 'He told me why he did it. [His father-in-law] was making some physical changes, meddling in his house, and yet Sam was not allowed to go there.'

His ex-wife has denied earlier reports that their youngest daughter was born with Down syndrome, clarifying that she had been born with medical complications after a premature birth.

She also slammed claims by her ex-husband that, as a member of the Exclusive Brethren church, he was ex-communicated when he divorced her and was banned from seeing his four children, now aged between six and 15 years old.

'He chose to leave the marriage and the church…and he has put it around the other way,' Ms Forrest told The New Zealand Herald.

'He still has legal access arrangements, it was his choice not to see them,' she said of their children.

Mr Forrest, said his second wife abandoned their son Leo (pictured) because her family were ashamed of his condition, has made global headlines since he started crowd fundraising to bring Leo to his native New Zealand

In a series of emails around the time he left the church, Mr Forrest repeatedly says he 'lost four innocent children' and blames the Exclusive Brethren for the 'deliberate break-up of a family'.

Daily Mail Australia has obtained a photo of Mr Forrest with his four children before he lost contact with them in 2011.

'All his extended family are also members of the Exclusive Brethren and are still forbidden by their religion to have any contact with him,' a source said.

'It was one of the reasons why he left in the first place and went to Armenia. He had no contact with his children and saw no future for himself in New Zealand. It was all very sad.' 

Mr Forrest married his Armenian wife Ruzan Badalyan 18 months ago and they divorced a week after baby Leo was born on January 21

Mr Forrest's crowd funding website has already raised more than $600,000 in his bid to bring up baby Leo in Auckland where he can have access to established disability services

Mr Forrest married his Armenian wife Ruzan Badalyan 18 months ago and they divorced a week after baby Leo was born.

At the time, Mr Forrest said his wife refused to look at or even touch Leo because Armenian culture believes a child with a condition like Down syndrome brings shame on the entire family.

She has been under scrutiny since her decision to give up Leo was made public.

Mr Forrest, who was brought up as a member of the Exclusive Brethren church in New Zealand. His ex-wife denied that he was ec-communicated after he divorced her, saying: 'he chose to leave the marriage and the church…and he has put it around the other way'

Mr Forrest wrote on his crowd-funding website on Monday that he 'still feels a great deal of love' for his ex-wife despite her decision to give up their son.

'I can assure you that I have tried my best to convince my wife we could keep the baby, but in her family, an orphanage seemed a safer option for Armenia,' he wrote. 

'I did everything I could to keep our family together, including suggesting we all go to New Zealand together. Her family also spent time trying to persuade me to surrender our son to an orphanage. 

'Ruzan should not be the target of all of the frustrations that this situation has created. Our paths may be moving in different directions, but she is Leo's mother and I still feel a great deal of love for her.' 

It comes after Ms Badalyan hit back at her ex-husband's claims she abandoned her baby, instead saying she had to make a 'ruthless decision' in the best interests of Leo. 

She released a statement via Facebook saying the long-awaited birth of her son was the happiest day, but when she woke she could only see alarmed faces around her.  

'My first question was about the whereabouts of my child. I remember the sad faces of my relatives and the doctors and the diagnosis that sounded like a verdict: 'Your child was born with a Down Syndrome.' One can never imagine my feelings at that moment,' she wrote.

'Hardly had I recovered from the first shock, when the doctor approached me and told me to voice my decision whether I was going to keep Leo or not. I had to make the most ruthless decision in my life within several hours.

'The first thing that came to my mind after the diagnosis was that I don't want my child to live in a country where certain stereotypes dominate the lives of people with DS and no opportunities at all. I want him to be involved and well-received in society, an integration that will require years and years for our society to adjust to.

'I saw the evasive looks of the doctors, my relatives' tear-stained faces, received calls of condolences and realised that only a move to a country with such standards as New Zealand would entitle my son to a decent life.' 

Leo's mother said the cost of raising a children with a disability also weighed on her.

'In Armenia every child is loved and respected and family is a high value, but in this country children with special needs do require special attention, huge financial resources and dedication,' she said.

'In the hardest moment of my life when my husband should be next to me and support and help to take the right decision, I could not find any support from his side.

'After that incident, he left the hospital notifying me hours later that he was taking the kid with him, that he is going to leave the country for New Zealand and I do not have anything to do with the situation.'

Mr Forrest's crowd funding website has already raised more than $490,000 in his bid to bring up baby Leo in Auckland where he can have access to established disability services and adequate support.

But it is unclear how much family support he will receive when he returns.  

'It's well known within the Exclusive Brethren community that Sam has been cut off by everyone because of divorcing his wife. He has no one to come back to,' a source said.

'You would hope that he'd get some support but it's very unlikely.'

Mr Forrest has been left stunned by the outpouring of support since he first shared his story. 

The outpouring of kind emotions and great wishes has been overwhelming. Leo is one lucky guy,' he said.

'He is doing well and is very healthy. He gets visitors daily who shower him with love and affection. Leo is the number one priority for me right now and needs all my attention.'

He said the money raised was far beyond what they expected or needed. 

The money will be used find a house in Auckland and to give Leo education opportunities.

There are also plans to use some of the funds to support parents in Armenia who are raising children with disabilities.
