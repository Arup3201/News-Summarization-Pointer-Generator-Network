The woman who claims to have allowed 84-year-old Powerball winner Gloria Mackenzie cut in line when she bought her lucky ticket said today she doesn't regret the decision - even though it might have cost her $590million.

Mindy Crandall, 34, says allowing the elderly Mackenzie to buy her lottery ticket first taught her young daughter an important lesson about kindness.

When Mackenzie came forward on Wednesday to finally claim her prize - two weeks after the record May 18 drawing - she thanked the anonymous woman who let her cut in line at that Publix grocery store in Zephyhills, Florida.

Mackenzie has since left the tin-roof duplex where she resided in Zephyrhills and moved in with her son Scott, who lives in a modest home in a working-class neighborhood in Jacksonville. She said she plans to split her winnings with him.

Neighbors say the elderly millionaire plans to continue living with Scott in Florida - albeit in a slightly bigger home. It's unknown how she will split her winnings with her other three children and her grandchildren.

'It could have been us, but things happen. Sometimes it's better to be patient than right. I knew we were teaching our daughter the right thing,' told ABC News.

Mrs Crandall says she believes she is the woman Mrs Mackenzie was talking about when she revealed in her public statement: 'While in line at Publix, another lottery player was kind enough to let me go ahead of them in line to purchase the winning Quick Pick ticket.'

Mrs Crandall, who lives in Zephyhills - the same small city where Mrs Mackenzie retired, told ABC News that she still remembers the elderly woman who stepped in front of her while she was waiting in line to buy her Powerball tickets last month.

Mrs Crandall says she was tending to her children at the time and didn't notice that someone had cut the line.

'My 10-year-old said, "Mom, There's a lady in front of us." I noticed that the lady was there. Didn't pay a lot of mind to it,' she told ABC.

When Mrs Mackenzie made it to the register, the clerk motioned for Mrs Crandall to come forward instead. Mrs Crandall waited. 'Go ahead,' she told the elderly Mrs Mackenzie.

'The joke was, that's the lady that's going to win it. I was like, "Yeah right. No one is going to win from little Zephyrhills," Mrs Crandall said.

Mrs Mackenzie, a widow and with four children and at least four grandchildren, also said in her statement that she is planning to split her winnings with her son, 54-year-old Scott Mackenzie, who lives in Jacksonville, Florida.

She declined to appear at the Florida Lottery news conference announcing her winnings on Wednesday and refused to speak with reporters as she left lottery headquarters.

She opted to take the lump sum payment of $370million - which will result in winnings after taxes of about $278million.

Mrs Mackenzie, 
who was the wife of a machine technician at a Maine paper mill, left the
trailer park where she spent more than two decades last year so that 
she could move into a low-income housing duplex across the street from a
cow pasture.

The building was worth just $105,000. Now she can buy the 
entire property more than 2,500 times over.

When
Mrs Mackenzie's former neighbor Nancy Williams, 79, learned that she 
had won millions, she responded: 'Oh bless her heart. Lord knows she 
could use it, too.'

Mrs Williams lives in the well-kept 
trailer park where Mrs Mackenzie spent 25 years with her husband Ralph. 
She said that Mrs Mackenzie came over every Sunday to visit with her 
neighbor and talk about family.

She said her grown children came to visit several times - even her family still living in Maine.

'She
never complained about anything. She was very nice and very friendly. 
We'd sit here and talk over an hour every Sunday,' Mrs Williams said.

Mrs Mackenzie bought four other Powerball tickets for the May 18 drawing, but the winning scorecard was her final purchase.

Last year, she moved from her trailer to a small grey duplex across the street of a cow pasture. Her old Ford Taurus sedan still sits out front.

News that a millionaire is living next door was pretty shocking to most of her neighbors, but in a good way.

'I was floored. I was shaking,' said a neighbor. 'I had no idea, I'm still shaking, I don't believe it. It's hard to believe.'

'We ain't seen her in awhile,' said 
another neighbor Sharon Cecil. 'I know she has kids I don't know where 
they're from or anything, but they might have come and got her!'

'I remember one time someone came and 
stole her alumninum off her air conditioning and somebody was replacing 
it and that's when I actually got to see her more,' said another 
neighbor James Hill. 'I'd say she's a very patient, lovable person, 
getting to know her.'
