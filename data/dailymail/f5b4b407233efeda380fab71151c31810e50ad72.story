It is believed that 58 people have died and it is feared that the death toll could reach three figures as a remote part of northern Afghanistan is hit by floods.

In addition, thousands more have been left homeless. The flooding is the most recent in a series of deadly flash floods, landslides and avalanches in a part of the country that is almost cut off from the rest.

Lt Fazel Rahman, the chief of police in the Guzirga i-Nur district of northeastern Baghlan, said that 54 bodies have been recovered so far including the remains of women and children, but many others are still missing.

He called for emergency assistance from the central government.

'So far no one has come to help us. People are trying to find their missing family members,' Lt Rahman said, adding that the district's police force was overstretched by the scale of the disaster.

A statement from the office of the president Hamid Karzai put the death toll at 58 while other sources placed it higher still.

Gen Mohammad Zahir Azimi, a spokesman for the Afghan Defence Ministry, said that two Army helicopters have been sent to the area to provide assistance.

The Afghanistan Natural Disaster Management Authority has begun shipping out stockpiles of food and other supplies to the affected area, said Mohammad Aslim Sayas, the deputy director of the agency.

Guzirga i-Nur district is located more than 85 miles north of the provincial capital, Puli Khumri.

Jawed Basharat, the spokesman for the Baghlan police, said that they were aware of the flooding, but that it would take eight to nine hours for them to reach the area by road.

Although people in the north of the country have for the most part been spared the horrors of the war, they have been subjected to several natural disasters.

Last month, a landslide triggered by heavy rain buried large sections of a remote northeastern village in Badakhshan which borders China, displacing some 700 families.

Authorities have yet to provide an exact figure on the number of dead from the May 2 landslide, and estimates have ranged from 250 to 2,700. Officials say it will be impossible to dig up all the bodies.

A landslide in Baghlan in 2012 killed 71 people. After days of digging unearthed only five bodies, authorities decided to halt the recovery effort and turn the area into a memorial for the dead.
