A tiny Victorian garage on a millionaire’s row has gone on the market for a whopping £80,000.

The lock-up in Cambridge on a road with an average house price of £900,000 has been described as a ‘Victorian detached’ in an ‘outstanding location just to the north of the river’.

The current owners are hoping the bubbling housing market and competition for property in the university city on Chesterton Hall Crescent will bag them a generous £80,000.

Garage for £80,000: The lock-up in Cambridge is in an 'outstanding location just to the north of the river'

Pricey location: Measuring just 20ft by 12ft, the garage in Cambridge comes with a 20ft by 13ft forecourt

Measuring just 20ft by 12ft, the garage comes with a 20ft by 13ft forecourt - but you can’t even sleep there, after a planning application to turn it into a home was refused by the council in 2004.

But changes to planning laws could mean permission may be granted by the council in the future.

Chris Carey, head of residential with Bidwells estate agents, said: ‘The price reflects the fact that in Cambridge it very difficult to find off street parking in the more urban areas.

‘And if someone owns a house in a street where house prices are up to a million pounds then they will want off street parking to go with the property, because that’s what buyers want.

‘It may not have planning permission to be a dwelling now but 10 years down the line it may and then £80,000 will look cheap. Cambridge is reflecting what is happening in London where garages are going for £300,000 to £400,000.’

The priciest recent sale on the road was £1,245,000 for a five-bedroom semi-detached house in August 2013. That is also the road's most expensive home by current value, according to Zoopla.

Expensive: The average house price on Chesterton Hall Crescent in the university city is £900,000

Cambridge house prices have soared by 20 per cent with property website Rightmove estimating the cost of an average home in the city as £419,000.

It has also become the fastest selling city in Britain. The Nationwide house price index, published in April, found average Cambridge prices are higher than those in London - £406,040 to £401,000.

Nick Redmayne, of estate agents Redmayne Arnold & Harris, which is representing the owner of the garage, said: ‘It was refused planning permission 10 years ago to be a dwelling but it may be easier now. But it could be an office studio or a place to park some very nice cars.

'I don’t think this is really a reflection on house prices in Cambridge or parking. It is an unusual property. It also has an inspection pit so it may be for someone who likes to fix up cars or turn it into a business.’

A new record was set in April for the most expensive garage in Britain, after a 568ft former coach house in Camberwell, south London, was sold for £550,000 - triple the asking price.
