Police have charged a 40-year-old Pennsylvania woman with having sex with a 13-year-old boy and then making him fake a toothache so he could get painkillers for her.

The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reported Latrobe police have charged Jesse Kuhns with having sex with the boy when he stayed at her home in March.

Kuhns also is accused of threatening him to keep him from telling anyone.

She threatened 'I will hurt you and bring your family down,' police told the newspaper.

The boy was coached on how to fake a toothache for his visits to the emergency room at Latrobe Hospital, police said

The boy was allegedly flashed by Kuhns and turned down her offers of sex on two separate occasions last year, according to The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.

Police say she also coached the boy about how to act if he had a toothache so she could obtain hydrocodone, which he was prescribed during emergency room visits in October, February and March.

Online court records don't list an attorney for Kuhns.

Kuhns faces a preliminary hearing Oct. 20 on charges including statutory sexual assault and corruption of minors.
