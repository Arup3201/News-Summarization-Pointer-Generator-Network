A Chinese mother has given birth to a baby weighing a huge 13lbs 10oz – more than six bags of sugar.

The unnamed woman, 27, believes her diet of milk, eggs and fruit was responsible for the size of her baby.

The newborn weighs almost twice as much as an average Chinese baby but both mother and baby are thought to be doing well.

A Chinese mother has given birth to a baby weighing a huge 13lbs 10oz - more than six bags of sugar

It is not currently known whether the baby was born naturally or by C-section.

Medics at the Shanghai hospital where the child was delivered believe the baby’s size was caused by the mother eating a lot and spending much of her pregnancy in bed, Sky News reports.

The doctors explained that she put on weight quickly during the pregnancy meaning the baby grew more rapidly than normal.

The new mother told Chinese state TV: ‘I drink one glass of milk [and] eat an egg every day. That's a must since I became pregnant. I also ate a lot of fruit.’

A relative of the woman added: ‘Soup with chicken, pigeon and fish is normal for an expectant mother, as well as seafood including shrimp and fish.’

Xu Chang'en, of the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Hospital of Fudan University, believes the baby could face health problems as it grows up.

He explained that the baby could struggle with its weight and with diabetes as rates of these conditions are higher in adults who were overweight at birth.

Despite the baby’s impressive size, it is not China’s biggest newborn.

His parents both had gigantism - his mother, Anna Bates, was 7ft 5ins tall and his father, Martin Van Buren Bates was 7ft 11ins tall.
