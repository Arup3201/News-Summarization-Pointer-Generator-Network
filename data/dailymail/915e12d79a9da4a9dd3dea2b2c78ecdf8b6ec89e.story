Ally: Ethiopian PM and long-term friend of the West Meles Zenawi has died following a lengthy illness

After two decades in charge of Ethiopia, Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has died.

The controversial ruler, who became a friend of the U.S. but was also accused of human rights abuses, lost his long battle with an undisclosed disease.

The 57-year-old who held a tight grip over the East African country but became a major US counter-terrorism ally, had not been seen in public for around two months, Ethiopian state television said.

Meles died just before midnight on Monday after contracting an infection, state TV announced.

Hailemariam Desalegn, who was appointed deputy prime minister and minister of foreign affairs in 2010, is thought to be in charge of the Cabinet.

In mid-July, after he did not attend a meeting of heads of state of the African Union in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia's capital, speculation increased that his health problems were serious.

Ethiopian officials gave no details and said the prime minister was in 'very good' health and would return to office soon, but international officials said quietly it was unlikely he would recover.

Born on May 8, 1955, Meles became president in 1991 and prime minister in 1995, a position that is both the head of the federal government and armed forces.

The U.S. has long viewed Meles as a strong security partner and has given hundreds of millions of dollars in aid over the years.

U.S. military drones that patrol East Africa - especially over Somalia - are stationed in Ethiopia. But Ethiopia has long been criticised by human rights groups over the government's strict control.

During Meles' election win in 2005, 
when it appeared the opposition was likely to make gains, he tightened 
security across the country, and on the night of the election declared a
state of emergency, outlawing any public gathering as his ruling party 
claimed a majority win.

Opposition
members accused Meles of rigging the election, and demonstrations broke
out. Security forces moved in, killing hundreds of people and jailing 
thousands.

In 2010 Meles won
another five years in office while receiving a reported 99 per cent of 
the vote. He is the long-time chairman of the Tigray People's Liberation
Front and has always identified strongly with his party.

'I
cannot separate my achievements from what can be considered as the 
achievements of the ruling party. Whatever achievement there might have 
been, it does not exist independent of that party,' he once said when 
asked what he thought would be his legacy.
