Bafétimbi Gomis scored his first goal for Swansea as they stepped up their preparations ahead of the new Premier League season with a 2-0 win at Exeter City.

The Swans followed up their 4-0 win over Plymouth on Sunday with a narrow win against the League Two side, as they played the final game of their pre-season tour in Devon.

It was the home side that started the brighter with Tom Nichols going close after just nine minutes. Craig Woodman found Nichols in the area but the 20-year-old headed narrowly over.

However, it would be the visitors who would go on to take the lead just 10 minutes later.

Gomis would make it a debut to remember as he headed home excellently from close range after Neil Taylor found the former Lyon man on 31 minutes.

Exeter City: Pym (Hamon 71); Baldwin, Coles (Riberio 60), Bennett (Tillson 68), Woodman (Dawson 64); Wheeler (Jay 64), Oakley (Butterfield 58), Grimes (Byrne 63), Davies (Riley-Lowe); Keohane (Pope 68); Nichols (Watkins 53).

Att: 2,274 (375 away)

Goals: Gomis 31, Sheehan 78

The hosts were unlucky not to equalise just before half-time as Arron Davies's cross found David Wheeler, who then flicked it onto the bar.

Just a minute later Garry Monk's side went straight up the other end and nearly doubled their advantage.

New signing Jefferson Montero found Gomis inside the area, who in turn shot off the post as the Swans went into the interval with a narrow one-goal lead.

The hosts, who fielded a comparatively young side, continued to give a good account of themselves in the second period, with crucial interceptions from Dwight Tiendalli thwarting the Grecians from drawing level.

The game was settled as a contest with 12 minutes remaining as young Swans midfielder Josh Sheehan fired in from close range after an assist from substitute Wilfried Bony.

Bony then went close to extending Swansea's lead in injury-time when his goal-bound header was cleared off the line by Aaron Dawson, as an entertaining friendly at St James Park drew to a close.
