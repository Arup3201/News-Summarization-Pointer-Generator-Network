Carlton Cole insists a shouting match with Sam Allardyce has eased the tension over his failed move from West Ham to West Brom.

Calamity struck on deadline day when, at 10.55pm, Allardyce was forced to call the striker at West Brom's training ground to tell him his move was off because a bid to sign Tottenham's Emmanuel Adebayor as a replacement had collapsed.

Having missed out on a two-and-a-half-year £5million contract at West Brom, Cole has confirmed he tore into his manager on the phone, but subsequent talks have cooled the situation.

By a quirk of timing, Cole is likely to face West Brom in the FA Cup fifth round, having made his first start since November 22 in the 0-0 draw at Southampton on Wednesday.

The 31-year-old, whose West Ham deal expires in four months, said: 'Mark Noble and Kevin Nolan said to me it would be something else if I could score the winner at West Brom for West Ham given what went on in the transfer window.

'I was upset at the time because I wasn't playing here as much as I wanted to.

'So when a team shows interest in you and offers you game time and it doesn't come off you might react this way. 

West Ham striker Cole had words with manager Sam Allardyce but has now moved on

'The manager has talked to me since that and we have moved on from there. It wasn't personal and these things happen in football. 

'I just have to get on with it and be professional and wait for my chance to come to start and it did against Southampton.'

Cole added: 'I was over there and the deal didn't go through. 

'The gaffer kept faith in me obviously by starting me against Southampton when I didn't expect it. I want to try to put a solid performance in.

'He knows what he gets from me and that's probably what Tony Pulis saw as well.'

West Ham striker Andy Carroll hobbles away from Southampton on Wednesday night

Cole's prospects of starting at the Hawthorns have been increased by the latest injury to Andy Carroll. 

The striker had a scan on his left knee on Thursday after being hurt in the draw at Southampton. Having injured the same knee against Liverpool at the end of January.

Allardyce fears Carroll will be out for more than two weeks, but will not find out categorically until he receives the scan results on Friday.

Noble and Nolan are expected to be fit for the West Brom clash after missing out in midweek through illness and a foot injury respectively.
