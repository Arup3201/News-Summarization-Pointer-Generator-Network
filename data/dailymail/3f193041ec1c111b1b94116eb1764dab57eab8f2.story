An operator of a highly popular YouTube channel dedicated to high-powered guns and explosives was found mysteriously shot to death, authorities said.

Keith Ratliff, who was a business partner at FPSRussia, YouTube's ninth most popular channel with more than three million active subscribers and a combined half billion views, was discovered on a rural road in Carnesville, Georgia.

Ratliff had a single gunshot wound the head and police are treating his death as a homicide.

Armed: Ratliffe had several weapons on him when he died

When authorities made the grisly discovery on Thursday, they noticed there were several guns near Ratliff, according to a local radio station report.

'For him not to pull out that gun and try to defend himself, he had to 
feel comfortable around somebody. Either that or he was ambushed,' said Ratliff's heartbroken widow, Amanda.

'You know, it just doesn't really add up,' she told a television station.

'We all want to know and we all want justice to be done,' Amanda says. 'He had way to much to look forward to in his life.'

Tragedy: Ratliffe had a wife and a two-year-old son

Amanda said their two-year-old son is having a terrible time adjusting to life without his father.

'It was really hard.  To know that he's going to go the rest of his life without his dad,' Amanda said, as their child, Jayden, clutched a picture of his dad that was taken on Christmas Eve.

Besides running the YouTube channel, Ratliff was also the owner of FPS Industries, which works in customized weaponry.

It is located in Carnesville, which is about a 90 minute drive from Atlanta.

Ratliff, who lived in Frankfort, Kentucky, with his family, wrote on his LinkedIn profile about his company, 'After a life of loving firearms and computers. I have combined both into
 one great new business that offers both viral marketing and quality 
firearms from one place.'

FPS is short-hand for first person shooter amongst video gamers.
