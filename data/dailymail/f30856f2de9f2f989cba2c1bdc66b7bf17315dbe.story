Lying almost 4,000 metres above sea level, this vast salt lake nestled amid the snow-capped peaks of Tajikistan's Pamir Plateau is one of the highest in the world.

Believed to have been formed when a meteor struck the earth millions of years ago, the aquamarine waters of Lake Karakul appear oasis-like amid the barren, stony landscape of the soaring Pamirs - known since Victoria times as the 'roof of the world'.

But despite its beauty, the ancient lake is home to little marine life aside from a few hardy loaches, and locals claim the water is so dense with salt that anyone who tried to sail a boat across the surface would find themselves capsizing.

The Dead Sea of Pamir: Lake Karakul, also know as the 'Black Lake', is a vast salt lake in the Pamir Mountains in Tajikistan

Less inviting than it looks: The vast salt take lies in the Pamir Mountains in Tajikistan, where the small population endures long and bitterly cold winters broken only short, cool summers

According to an article on EnglishRussia.com, the water is so dense that boats simply turn over, meaning anyone who wishes to sail along the lake must use a special raft weighted down with lead plates.

The more dense water is, the more likely it is that things floating on its surface will become unbalanced, because the depth of flotation is much higher.

Karakul is an inhospitable 
environment for its few inhabitants - a small community of Kyrgyz 
people living in a village that takes its name from the lake.

The community survives in the bleak region on the border with Kashgar, one of Central Asia's most sparsely populated regions, through the nomadic herding of flocks of sheep, yaks or goats.

The villagers spend the summer in the high pastures, but in winter return to Karakul, tending fires in their yurts to endure the penetrating cold in the mountains, which can plummet to -45C in the winter months.

The lake is famous for the ever-changing colours of its surface, which reflects the surrounding peaks and shimmers dark green, azure or light blue depending on the light.

But when the sun slips behind the clouds the depths of the lake - which is 238metres deep in parts - appear dark as night.

It is the this quality that saw the ancient crater lake christened Lake Karakul, or the 'black lake'.

In the 19th Century the British named the salt lake Lake Victoria in honour of their monarch, and all British maps from that period label it as Lake Victoria of the Pamirs.

That name is understood to have fallen out of use with the advent of the Soviets, and once again the salt lake became known by its Kyrgyz title.

Stunning scenery: The vast salt lake, the highest of the Pamir Plateau and the biggest of hundreds of ancient lakes in the region, makes for spectacular scenery

Bleak: Lying at the extreme edges of habitation, the landscape surrounding the lake has no trees of flowers, and is home only to the occasional sheep or yak

Endurance: The area around Lake Karakul is home to a village of the same name, where a small community of Kyrgyz live in yurts and herd yaks and sheep

Barren: Rocky ground surrounds the lake in the Pamirs in Tajikistan, close to the border with western China

Vast: The high salt content in the lake's waters mean Karakul is home to scant marine life, apart from a few hardy loaches

Shades: The clear waters of Karakul can take on dazzling shades of green or blue - but its shadowy appearance when the sun moves behind the clouds mean it is sometimes known as the 'black lake'

High altitudes: The high, rugged peaks of the Pamirs are reflected in the glassy surface of the ancient salt lake, believed to have been formed when a meteor struck the earth

Remote: Lake Karakal lies in the Tajik Pamirs close to the border with Kashgar, China, in one of the most sparsely populated regions of Central Asia

Inhospitable: Karakul's inhabitants, nomadic farmers, spend the summer months in the high pastures before returning to the village in winter, burning fires to ward off the penetrating cold

The 'roof of the world': Divided into two basins, Lake Karakul sits amid spectacular scenery in the rugged Pamirs

Survival: The small Kyrgyz community in the village of Karakul spend the summer months in the high pastures, before returning to the village to sit out the bitter cold

Lone: Lying close to the border with Kashgar in western China, the lake is within one of the most sparsely populated regions of Central Asia

Views: The surface of the water changes from black to azure to deepest green depending on how the light falls on Karakul

Vast: In Victorian times the British marked the lake on maps as Lake Victoria, in honour of their monarch, but the name fell out of use with the advent of the Soviets

Nomadic: The Kyrgyz community that lives in the village of Karakul in the remote region herds small flocks of sheep, goat or yaks amid the barren landscape
