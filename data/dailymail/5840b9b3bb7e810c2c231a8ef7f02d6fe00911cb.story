A man who violently raped a 14-year-old schoolgirl is pleading to have his electronic monitoring tag removed because it’s making him ‘paranoid’.

Darren Michael Costello’s victim hanged herself after he raped her after following her as she walked near a skating rink in southwestern Brisbane in November 1995.

His release from jail in 2010, after spending nearly 15 years locked up for rape and his other offences, sparked outrage from the local community when Queensland’s Attorney-General Cameron Dick failed in his bid to keep Costello in jail under the Dangerous Prisoners Sexual Offenders Act.

Now, Costello, 43, is asking Queensland’s Supreme Court to take off his ankle tag because he ‘doesn’t want people asking questions’ when it beeps, the Courier Mail reports.

In an application for its removal on December 19, he reportedly said the device makes him feel ‘uncomfortable, paranoid, uneasy and anxious ... with everyone knowing my personal business’.

‘I feel the monitoring device is an obstacle and barrier in my way from (sic) being able to try and live a normal life and engage with people.’

The Courier Mail reports Costello has been offered three jobs if he can get his monitor removed.

His case will be heard in court on February 3.

He was originally released back into the community under a supervision order in a judgement handed down by Supreme Court Justice Debra Mullins.

In her ruling, Justice Mullins said that psychiatric tests revealed Costello was not a paedophile but had a low IQ.

She warned that he should stay away from drugs and alcohol. 

Costello was on parole for two other offences when he attacked the 14-year-old girl.

Ankle monitors are designed to be tamper-resistant, if a criminal tries to remove it themselves than it will usually alert authorities.

The tags are mainly used on offenders who are on parole or under house arrest and work by sending a radio frequency signal that shows their location to authorities.
