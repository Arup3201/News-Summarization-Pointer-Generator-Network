It has been revealed that the famed Chicago chef who died suddenly in his home yesterday had a brain aneurysm and knew that the condition was fatal.

Charlie Trotter's initial autopsy was deemed 'inconclusive' by the Chicago medical examiner's office and they will conduct additional tests that will be finished in six to eight weeks. They said that there was no foul play or trauma.

A close friend has spoken out about how the 54-year-old chef had previously disclosed his medical condition.

A sommelier who worked with Trotter and became a close friend over their years of working together said that doctors had told Trotter not to fly to avoid adding pressure to his brain.

'It was a time bomb, and he felt that he didn't have a lot of time left,' sommelier Larry Stone told The Chicago Tribune.

Final appearance: Charlie Trotter spoke at a culinary conference on Friday and he flew to Wyoming to attend, going against doctors orders as they wanted to avoid extra pressure on his brain

The last picture? Trotter spoke at a culinary conference in Jackson Hole on Friday, just four days before he died and one audience member noticed that his left hand- seen in his pocket while posing with attendee Megan Gallagher- was shaking

'It was inoperable, and it was not something that could be repaired; it was deep inside the brain.'

Mr Stone told the paper that his 54-year-old former boss had multiple seizures in the time leading up to his death on Tuesday.

The first hints of trouble came last year when he closed his eponymous, award-winning restaurant after 25 years, saying that he wanted to spend more time with his family and study philosophy.

That didn't keep him from staying active, in spite of doctor's orders.

Just days before his death, Trotter flew to and from Jackson Hole, Wyoming to speak at a culinary conference.

Nothing
seemed particularly unusual about Trotter during that appearance, but 
one audience member did notice that the chef's left hand was shaking 
slightly as he held the microphone.

Well-respected: Trotter won 10 coveted James Beard awards including the humanitarian award last year

The chef's wife Rochelle was seen by neighbors screaming and crying hysterically as ambulances arrived at their home after Trotter's son Dylan found his father unconscious.

'He was much loved and words cannot describe how much he will be missed,' she said in a statement.

'His impact upon American cuisine and the culinary world at large will always be remembered.'

Multi-course tasting menus that are now seen on many fine dining establishments were his handiwork, as he traded the 10-course menu at his flagship restaurant on a daily basis and boasted that frequent customers never had the same thing twice.

He had a great influence on both the local and national food scene, one that many expect to be felt for years to come.

Wine was a passion for Trotter, and when asked at the event in Jackson Hole what he would like for his final meal, he said he wanted only the best: a bottle of 1900 Chateau Margaux, a wine that costs up to $16,000.

During an interview when he decided to close his restaurant, he revealed his grand plans for what would happen to his restaurant's 26,000-strong wine cellar after it closed last year.

'I did a mathematical 
calculation: If I live to the average life expectancy of the American 
male — 78.9 — and I consume one bottle of wine every day, I should 
consume the last bottle on my last day on this planet,' he said in an 
interview with The New York Times.
