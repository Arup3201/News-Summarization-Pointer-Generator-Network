A one-year-old cat has finally been rescued after spending six days stuck up a tree in Brighton.

The animal, named Coco, was spotted on the branches of the tree after disappearing from her home on Monday.

But despite their best efforts, neither firefighters nor the RSPCA could encourage the animal to come down.

Failed attempt: Despite their efforts, neither firefighters nor the RSPCA could encourage her to come down

Each time they ventured up the tree to rescue her, she darted on to a different branch, out of reach.

However, the cat was eventually saved six days later - after her owner, Andrea, was advised to ask a tree surgeon to help with the rescue.

A neighbour, who wishes to remain unnamed, described the rescue as 'pretty blooming amazing'.

He said: 'This middle-aged guy just said: 'f**** this' and with that, scaled the tree really, really high, grabbed a pole and prodded Coco to encourage her to jump on the roof.

'Just as he did this, Andrea arrived. She was terrified Coco would fall, but we all stood underneath with a massive blanket in case she slipped.

'She was on a tiny, thin branch so had very little leverage to jump, but she sort of threw herself and just made it. With that, she legged it over the roof and ended up on a ledge.

'But the guy didn't leave it at that. He then organised planks and ladders and Andrea climbed the ladder and grabbed her.'

An East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service spokesman said firefighters had attended the scene, but had been unable to coax the cat down.

'It is likely we will have advised the animal's owner to contact someone like the tree surgeon,' she added.
