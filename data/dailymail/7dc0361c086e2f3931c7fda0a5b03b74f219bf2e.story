Dentists are calling for a dramatic reduction of around 75 per cent in daily sugar consumption to save the nation’s teeth.

Experts at University College London say consumption of added sugar in treats like sweets, cakes, chocolate and fizzy drinks should be cut to around four teaspoons a day.

A cap at that level would equate to less than half a normal can of Coca-Cola, which contains nine teaspoons of sugar, two digestives or just one bowl of Kellogg’s Frosties cereal.

The availability of advanced toothpastes and the addition of fluoride to the water supply in some countries and regions has reduced tooth decay, however treatment still accounts for 6-10 per cent of total health costs.

A study published today argues that only a significant cut in the use and consumption of sugar – particularly when it is added to processed food and drink – will make a difference.

The findings will fuel demands for the introduction of some kind of sugar tax on fizzy drinks and other foods – similar to those applied to cigarettes – in order to drive up the cost and drive down consumption.

Any such measure would be fiercely fought by the food industry, which insists sugar is natural source of calories and can be eaten safely as part of a normal healthy diet.

The warnings about sugar consumption come from Professor Aubrey Sheiham, who is Emeritus Professor of Dental Public Health at UCL and co-author of the study.

Prof Sheiham said: ‘Tooth decay is one of the most widespread health problems and it is thought around a third of UK children aged 12 have visible tooth decay.

‘Added sugar has found its way into almost all food, and the use of sugar as a means to calm, entertain, or reward children has become normalised, whereas sugar should be an occasional treat. ‘The government must stop acting in the best interests of the food and drink industry rather than individuals, and take action on sugar now.’ 

The government’s chief medical officer, Dame Sally Davies, has expressed sympathy for the idea of a sugar tax, while an expert group set up by the official watchdog Public Health England has signalled it should be considered.

An ‘options for action’ document prepared by the organisations identifies six possible ways of reducing sugar intake: a tax on sugary drinks; foods being reformulated to contain less sugar; a cut in portion sizes; advertising rules being tightened; health warnings on  sugary products; and encouraging farmers to grow fruit and vegetables instead of sugar beet.

The report estimates that a 20 per cent tax on fizzy drinks, which would raise the price of a can from 70p to 84p, would cut the number of overweight Britons by more than a quarter of a million.

The average sugar consumption per day is around 58g or 14.5 teaspoons for adults and 76g or around 19 teaspoons for teenagers.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) has recently called for a reduction in consumption to around 5 per cent of daily calories, which equates to 25g or six teaspoons. 

The new study suggests even lower levels are necessary to protect teeth from decay or caries, bringing the figure down to 2-3 per cent of calories, which equates to 15g a day or four teaspoons. That would represent a reduction of 74 per cent against the current average for adults.

The research paper, co-authored by Prof Sheiham and obesity expert Professor Philip James, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, is published in the Public Health Nutrition Journal.It concludes: ‘Previous analyses based on children have misled public health analyses on sugars….The much greater adult burden of dental caries highlights the need for very low sugar intakes throughout life, e.g. 2-3 per cent energy intake, whether or not fluoride intake is optimum.’ 

Nutritionist and Campaign Director of Action on Sugar, Katharine Jenner, backed the study findings, saying: ‘Added sugars are completely unnecessary in our diets and are strongly linked to dental decay as well as to obesity and Type II Diabetes.’
