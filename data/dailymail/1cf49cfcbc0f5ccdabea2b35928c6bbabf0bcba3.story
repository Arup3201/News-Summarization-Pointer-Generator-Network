A Russian billionaire whose partner complained she was struggling to live on £10,000-a-week has gone to the High Court in a bid to lift a freezing order on his assets.

Sergei Pugachev was made the subject of a strict court order which caps his and his partner, Alexandra Tolstoy's, spending at £10,000-a-week due to an investigation being carried out in Russia.

Ms Tolstoy recently told the Mail on Sunday the order made it difficult for the couple to manage their homes and staff - who include three nannies, two housekeepers, two drivers and a personal trainer.

Today, Mr Pugachev challenged a global order freezing on his £1.1billion assets by the High Court in London, which was made earlier this year after an application by Russian authorities investigating his role in the collapse of a bank in 2010.

Sergei Pugachev and his partner Alexandra Tolstoy, have complained about a court order which restricts their spending to £10,000 a week

Russia's ASV — the Deposit Insurance Agency, in translation, which monitors and safeguards Russian banks — is looking into the collapse of his Mezprombank in 2010.

The freeze prevents the couple - who have three children - from selling their two London homes or their villa in the south of France or doing anything to diminish their value.

But it was a stipulation that their budget be limited to £10,000-a-week which Ms Tolstoy - a distant relation of the famous Russian writer - branded 'draconian'.

She said it prevents them from maintaining their historic chateau in the hills overlooking Nice which is set in 15 acres and whose neighbours include Elton John.

She said: ‘The budget for that house alone is £1.2 million a year (£23,000 a week), hence the legal appeal. It’s like maintaining a stately home.’

She added: ‘Apart from the five of us, we have live-in nannies and a live-in Bulgarian doctor, because Sergei has a heart problem.’

Ms Tolstoy said the order made it difficult for the couple to run their two London houses, their 'stately home' in the south of France and employ their team of nannies, security staff and housekeepers

There are three nannies who work in rotation - English, French, and Russian - to enhance the children’s language skills. Each one lives with the family for a week before the next one takes over.

Ms Tolstoy wouldn't disclose salaries, but given that sought-after nannies can command £40,000 a year, while housekeeping and security staff may be on roughly £25,000, the couple could well be spending about £250,000 a year on staff just for their London home.

At the time of the interview, with the Mail on Sunday, it was reported that the family also had five cars to maintain and run in London, including a Rolls-Royce and Bentley, and two yachts in France.

It was also reported that their eldest children, aged four and five, were due to start at a French-speaking private school in London in September, at a total cost of about £30,000 a year.

Ms Tolstoy also admitted to being ‘a clothes-aholic’ but said she believes in buying investment fashion items in London, Paris and Monaco, rather than cheap High Street ‘tat'.

She revealed that she likes French and Italian ‘pretty’ designers, such as Chanel and Valentino, and cutting-edge British designers like Christopher Kane and Jonathan Saunders.

She said of the staff payroll: ‘People might think that’s a crazy amount of money, but why is it a bad thing for Sergei to pay that into the English economy?

‘Those people might otherwise be unemployed. And why should the people who work for us lose their jobs because of some political thing the Russians are doing?

‘We feed them and pay for all their travel - we’re good employers. Hopefully they will all come in under the £10,000-a-week budget.’

Mr Pugachev started High Court action today against the order, which was brought in at the request of Russian financial investigators

Mr Pugachev - once called the ‘Kremlin’s banker’ - insists the investigation into the collapse of his former bank is politically motivated.

Despite once looking after the money of president Vladimir Putin’s inner circle, he fell out of favour in 2010 and was eventually forced to flee the country.

He launched a bid to overturn the freezing order today in a High Court case which is expected to last six days.

The Russian DIA dispute his claims that the investigation is a campaign ordered by the Kremlin and insist Mezprombank was given ample opportunity to pay Russian authorities.

It issued a statement saying: 'The DIA believes that it has strong claims against Mr Pugachev, who is accused of extracting very significant sums (in excess of US$ 2 billion) from Mezhdunarodny Promyshlenniy Bank CJSC to the detriment of its creditors.

'The DIA will contend that the freezing injunction was rightly granted and should be maintained. 

'Also, the DIA rejects Mr Pugachev's allegations, which have been widely reported in the media, that the proceedings are politically motivated and that it is an untrustworthy or corrupt organisation. 

'The DIA takes its responsibilities very seriously and believes that it is in the best interests of the Bank's creditors to pursue the litigation against Mr Pugachev.

“In relation to Mr Pugachev's challenge to the jurisdiction of the English Court, the DIA brought proceedings against Mr Pugachev in England because until recently he had not engaged in any way in the Russian proceedings and also because he permanently resides in England. 

'Provided that S.V. Pugachev formally submits to the jurisdiction of the Russian court and defends the case on the merits, the DIA is prepared to agree, subject to certain conditions, that the claim in Russia should go ahead first. 

'What is most important is that Mr Pugachev faces justice, whether in England or in Russia, and that any judgment ultimately obtained by the DIA can be enforced against Mr Pugachev's assets outside Russia.'
