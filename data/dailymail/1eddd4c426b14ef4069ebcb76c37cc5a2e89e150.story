Travel ban: Cheryl Carter, personal assistant to former NI chief executive Rebekah Brooks, has been forced to surrender her passport

Rebekah Brooks' personal assistant was planning to emigrate to Australia just days before she was arrested in the News Of The World phone hacking scandal, it has emerged.

Cheryl Carter, 47, had her passport confiscated by officers 
from Scotland Yard's Operation Weeting team, set up to investigate 
allegations of phone hacking at the newspaper, where Ms Brooks 
was a former editor.

The 
arrest, on suspicion of attempting to pervert the course of justice, means that Mrs Carter has been separated from her husband and two
children, who have had to fly to Australia without her to meet strict 
visa requirements.

As Ms 
Brooks' personal assistant for 19 years, police believe Mrs Carter has an
'intimate knowledge' of the former chief executive's day-to-day 
arrangements.

Mrs Carter 
would have had to keep business diaries and personal schedules as Ms 
Brooks rose through the News International ranks, From News Of The World
editor to Sun editor, and finally to NI chief executive.

Police hope Mrs Carter, who denies any wrongdoing, can shed more light onto the
hacking investigation, and felt it necessary to arrest her and restrict
her movement for further questioning.

In stark contrast, no such restrictions are currently placed on Ms Brooks, who enjoyed a New Year sunshine break in Cape Town, South Africa, with her husband Charlie.

Though arrested on July 15 last year, like many News International executives Ms Brooks was allowed to attend a police station by appointment to be questioned.

She is bailed to return for questioning by police in March. Her lawyer has said she denies committing any criminal offence.

Ms Brooks also became a mother to a baby girl Scarlett, born via a surrogate at the end of January.

It is unclear how long Mrs Carter will be separated from her own children. She was arrested on January 6 at her home in Billericay, Essex, during a dawn raid by Operation Weeting officers.

Detectives are understood to be 
investigating allegations that emails were destroyed at the company 
before evidence was handed over to the Metropolitan Police.

Mrs Carter is a partner in a cosmetics 
business with former model and celebrity make-up artist Sue Moxley, and 
has also offered beauty tips on website Thinkingslimmer.com.

It is understood she left NI shortly 
after Ms Brooks resigned from the company and was planning to relocate to 
Australia at the end of January to take up employment at News Limited, 
the Australian arm of Rupert Murdoch's News International.

While sources at NI told The 
Independent newspaper that Mrs Carter's move Down Under had been planned
for some time, other colleagues reportedly expressed surprise - not only at the move but how
Mrs Carter and her family were able to obtain Australian visas.

One was quoted in the paper as saying:
'It's quite difficult to get to Australia and Cheryl is a make-up 
expert - she doesn't exactly have expert skills.'

Operation Weeting is running in 
parallel with Operation Elveden, into alleged bribery of public 
officials. A string of senior journalists at The Sun newspaper have been
arrested in connection with the Elveden investigation.

Phone-hacking
detectives working their way through 300 million emails from NI have 
arrested a series of high-profile figures, including ex-Downing Street 
communications chief Andy Coulson.

Some
1,800 people have come forward to express fears that they may have been
hacked but the final total of people whose phones were hacked by the 
News of the World will be about 800, the force believes.

The
scandal has already led to the closure of the Sunday tabloid after 168 
years, prompted a major public inquiry, and forced the resignation of 
Metropolitan Police commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson and assistant 
commissioner John Yates.

The News International Staff Association wants an urgent meeting with News Corp boss Rupert Murdoch over the role played by an internal committee into the arrests of ten journalists at The Sun newspaper.

The association, representing NI staff, has discovered that the Management and Standards Committee (MSC)Â  - set up by News Corp - gave information to the police about News Corp staff.

One claim, denied by the MSC, is that it is passing details of expenses claims - specifically lunch or drinks claims with contacts.

NI staff - including those at newspapers The Sun, The Times and the Sunday Times - are concerned the MSC is compromising the anonymity of their sources and contacts.

But a spokeman for the MSC told The Guardian: 'The information handed to the police is relating to unlawful material. The information is redacted to ensure that lawful journalistic inquiries are not threatened.'
