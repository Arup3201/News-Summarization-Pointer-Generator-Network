The owner of a Sydney convenience store which caught fire, killing three people, deliberately planned the explosion with a 'complex' set-up of fuel containers so that he could collect on the insurance pay-out, police will allege.

Adeel Khan, who was charged on Tuesday with the murder of three people living upstairs from his Rozelle business, demonstrated 'disregard for human life' as he deliberately set his business ablaze on September 4, court documents claim. 

Police will allege he deliberately' and 'dishonestly' started the inferno.

'It (is) the belief of police that the accused intentionally set about to destroy his business by fire,' the statement of facts says.

'The intent when doing so was to make a financial claim against his insurance.'

Adeel Khan, 44, was charged with three counts of murder in hospital over the fire explosion in Rozelle - Sydney's inner west - that killed three people

Emergency services were called to a fire explosion at a convenience store on Darling Street on September 4

Police will allege Khan knew Bianka O'Brien and her one-year-old son Jude, along with their 27-year-old Chris Noble, who all died in the fire, and he was aware that the building's only entry and exit was via the rear driveway.

'The accused acted to cause the explosion and subsequent fire during early hours of the morning when it could only be expected that the above residents would be at home and at their most vulnerable whilst asleep,' court papers said.

'The very act of setting even a small fire in the circumstances demonstrated the accused disregard for human life.'

Court documents say baby Jude woke early on the morning of the fire. His parents comforted him and put him back to sleep.

Ms O'Brien later told her husband, John, it smelt as if someone was spray-painting in their driveway.

John then decided to go to work early, and left about 3.30am before the explosion erupted about half an hour later.

Forensic examiners allegedly found what police described as a 'complex and elaborate set-up' of petrol fuel loads throughout Khan's shop, office and storeroom. 

Plastic fuel containers were found placed at various points throughout the rubble 'connected by lengths of material cut into strips and tied together', police will allege.

One was connected to a rechargeable 6V battery and adjacent from this was 'a number of AA batteries stuck together and joined to the larger battery by lengths of wire.'

Forensic tests later claim to have detected petrol on Khan's clothes and shoes, and police allege to have found a carbon-fibre breathing mask in the pocket of his trousers. 

Plastic fuel containers were found inside milk crates similar to those seen via CCTV footage being filled up by Khan at a Croydon Park petrol station just three days before the fire on September 1, it has been alleged. 

Police found a receipt for 38.82 litres of petrol, and also a further 7.28 litres, during a search warrant of Khan’s home in Greenacre, the report states. 

Police also claim that Khan's car – a black Rav 4 - was found unlocked with the keys in the ignition in the rear driveway of the shop with a 10 litre fuel container full of petrol. 

Khan's version of events differ from the police documents as he told officers he was held up by three robbers at 11.30pm the night before the blaze which happened at about 4am.

He said one bought a packet of cigarettes while another produced a handgun ordering him to lock up the shop and turn off the lights as a third offender arrived.

He told police he was put in the storeroom and his hands were loosely bound by garbage bags, and his eyes were also covered by a bag.

During the next four hours Khan said the thieves stole $3,000 in cash from his pocket, his wallet, mobile phone and between $1,500 - $1,700 from the cash register.

Then the offenders snacked on sandwiches and drinks from the shop.

He said five to ten minutes after the offenders eventually left the store, he fled to his car when the explosion went off.

However, shortly after the blast, paramedics allege when they questioned Khan to assess his level of consciousness that he repeatedly responded saying : 'I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I didn't mean it, I'm so sorry.'

Emergency workers had to extricate Khan, who was trapped under the commercial drinks fridge, after seeing his hand sticking out from the rubble. Police will allege a cigarette lighter was found nearby. 

Paperwork seized during the search warrant of Khan's house 'revealed signs of financial distress' detailing a disconnection notice by AGL for being in arrears of $3,435 for a bill which had a due date of August 25, police allege.

The police will also claim that Khan told his real estate that he would pay his monthly rent of $8,800 on the day that the fire occurred - although it was due three days before on September 1.

The documents state that Khan increased his insurance for the shop's stock and interior in February, and then again in May, to the current value of $225,000.

Police claim Khan said his business was in 'direct competition' with the larger IGA supermarket, which was only 60-70 metres away, and also 'surrounding specialty food outlets.' 

Bianka O'Brien and one-year-old son Jude were killed in the fatal inferno earlier this month

It has also been reported that when the Pakistan Consul visited Khan in hospital, the shop owner said the blast was started by a gas cylinder. 

Daily Telegraph reports than Mr Khan told the consul member: 'I didn't do anything. I don't know what happened, I am very upset.'

'I have sympathy with the people who lost their lives.' 

However reports claim his wife  was worried about her husband's unusual disappearance from their home in south-west Sydney at 4am - the morning the shop on Darling Street was destroyed in the fatal explosion. 

A close friend revealed Naima Adeel was concerned when she discovered her husband wasn't at their Greenacre home and tried to reach him on his phone a number of times.

Days after the fire rocked the close-knit community, neighbours told media outlets that Mr Khan usually closed his store at midnight and reopened it at 7am.

Rozelle businesses say it was unusual for Mr Khan who wasn't often seen behind the counter of his business, to be at the shop that early as it doesn't open until about 7am.

But Ms Adeel, who has been questioned by police over the fatal fire at Rozelle, has also dismissed allegations her husband was involved and labelled them as 'rumours'. 

At a bedside hearing on Tuesday, Khan was charged with 25 offences, including three counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder, three counts of manslaughter. He also faces 17 charges related to property damage including one of setting a fire for a financial gain.

He was refused bail and will face Central Local Court on October 21. 

Chris Noble (pictured), 27, was also killed in the fire explosion which also injured three others, including shop owner Adeel Khan
