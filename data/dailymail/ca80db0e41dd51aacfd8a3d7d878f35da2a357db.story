Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt has asked NICE to work with cancer charities in the hope that more life-extending drugs will be approved for use

Jeremy Hunt will today order a review of the system for approving cancer drugs amid criticism that thousands of NHS patients are denied life-extending treatment.

The Health Secretary will tell the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence to work with cancer charities and researchers.

He will also announce a 40 per cent rise in resources to pay for vital treatments blocked by NICE.

He is to increase the Cancer Drugs Fund from £200million to £280million for the next two years to improve access to drugs currently deemed too expensive.

NICE has been ordered to review its system for approving drugs following complaints that it bases its trials solely on patients with no other underlying health conditions.

It is being asked to include evidence from patients with other conditions, a move that could see more drugs being approved.

Health chiefs have been told to renegotiate with the drugs industry to drive down the price of cancer treatments.

‘It’s vitally important that as many people as possible have access to these pioneering, life-enhancing drugs,’ said Mr Hunt, adding that the fund ‘has an essential role in helping us realise our ambition to be the best place in Europe to survive cancer’.

Two more drugs have been approved for immediate inclusion on the Cancer Drugs Fund list as a result of today’s decision.

The first is Xtandi, a drug for treating advanced prostate cancer.

The second is Revlimid, which will become available for patients with the rare blood condition myelodysplastic syndrome for the first time.

Officials will also now review the list of drugs approved by the fund ‘to ensure patients are offered the most effective drugs for their condition and [so that] new drugs can be added to the list’.

The Cancer Drugs Fund was established in April 2011 following a public outcry at decisions by NICE to block certain treatments on cost grounds.

It is credited with helping more than 55,000 cancer patients by paying for costly drugs that would not otherwise have been provided on the NHS.

But critics complain it is little more than a sticking plaster and are pressing for fundamental reform of NICE.

The organisation, which is responsible for deciding which drugs are made available on the NHS, is blamed by some for unfairly blocking drugs it deems to be poor value for money.

Xtandi, a drug designed to fight prostate cancer (pictured), has already been approved under the new rules. Mr Hunt will also increase the Cancer Drugs Fund from £200million to £280million for the next two years

NICE says it makes no sense to fund drugs that can extend life for a few weeks or months but cost tens of thousands of pounds per patient, when the money could be better spent on other treatments.

But critics point out that it rejects almost two-thirds of the cancer treatments it assesses – meaning that patients in England are denied drugs that are available in other parts of the world.

NICE came under fire earlier this month when it rejected the drug Kadcyla, which can extend life for women with an aggressive form of breast cancer for six months, but which costs £90,000 per patient.

The Department of Health last night said the drug was available via the Cancer Drugs Fund, and that funding for the scheme has been guaranteed until at least 2016.

Cancer charities welcomed the increased funding and said a thorough review was vital.

Mark Flannagan, chief executive of Beating Bowel Cancer, said: ‘The current system of pricing and approving drugs is broken and is letting down cancer patients.

‘NICE and the pharmaceutical industry must show greater flexibility and a genuine willingness to work together in the interests of all cancer patients.’ Andrew Wilson, chief executive of the Rarer Cancers Foundation, described the funding increase and review as ‘an important start’ in ensuring the Cancer Drugs Fund is sustainable in the long-term.

Chris Askew, chief executive of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, also welcomed the news, but warned that several ‘innovative, effective drugs’ are still ‘sitting on the shelf of no use to anybody’.
