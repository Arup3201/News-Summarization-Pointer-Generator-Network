Caught in startling close-up detail, these stunning images give an unusual perspective on the animal world.

Award winning Hungarian photographer Bence Mate's breathtaking images capture wildlife unbelievably up close and personal.

His nickname - 'the invisible wildlife photographer' - offers an explanation as to just how he manages to capture such intimate snaps. Bence can spend days, weeks or even months quietly tucked away in a hide that he himself has carefully designed and built.

These often utilise one-way glass, which is what enables him to get so close to his oblivious subjects. 

Bence comments: 'When walking in the wild with a pair of binoculars around our necks, we often witness breathtaking moments in nature.

'But at such moments, factors such as distance, light, background, environment and the miracle of surprise, seldom enable us to pass on our visual experience to others.

'In my work, I have strived to "forecast" when such moments will occur and capture them in photographs.'

He adds: 'Planning and lots of patience are usually behind a well executed natural history photograph. Along with a dose of good luck!'

'Indeed, I have crouched for hours, days, weeks, sometimes even months waiting for fortune to shine.'
