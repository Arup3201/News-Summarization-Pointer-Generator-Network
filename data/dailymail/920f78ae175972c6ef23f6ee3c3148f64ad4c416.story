An Egyptian teenager accused of illegally protesting his country’s government has defected to the United States after attending an international science fair for high school students in Los Angeles.

Abdullah Assem, 17, decided not to board a Cairo-bound plane Sunday for fear he would be arrested upon landing.

For the last four days he has stayed with family friends in Los Angeles County while he seeks asylum in the U.S.

Seeking asylum: Egyptian teen prodigy Abdullah Assem chose not to board a flight home after attending a science fair in Los Angeles

Last week, Abdullah was one of 1,787 teens participating in the six-day International Science and Engineering Fair sponsored by chipmaker Intel at the Los Angeles Convention Center.

His project, 'Eye Detection and Tracking-Based Communication System for Tetraplegia Patients,' had qualified for the competition through one of the program’s 450 preliminary science fairs. His research involved the use of eyeglasses and motion sensors to enable quadriplegics to use computers.

Abdullah was arrested April 25 in Tahrir Square in downtown Cairo and accused by police of illegally protesting - apparently by flashing the banned four-fingered hand gesture showing support for ousted Egyptian President Mohammed Morsi.

Assem said he was handcuffed, blindfolded and forced to sit on the floor of a government building while he was kicked and called a traitor for 16 hours, reports The New York Times.

He spent two weeks in jail, but was finally released and permitted to attend this week's science fair in Los Angeles after his imprisonment received much publicity in Egypt, where he is celebrated as the 'little inventor.'

Against violence: Assem was arrested and held for two weeks, accused of forming an anti-government group and firing at a government building, charges he denies. He says he has no political inclination but 'rejects the blood' that has been shed recently

'They accused me of a crazy thing - saying I had created a group with 15 people and shot against a building that is impossible to get to,' Assem told The New York Times Thursday..

'When they took me in,' he said, referring to the Egyptian police, 'I had no idea where I am. They were asking me about everything I have written in my life. I asked them the whole time to tell my family where I am or that I am alive, and they refused that. They just said again and again: "Something bad can happen to you."'

It wasn't until he arrived at the airport Saturday that Assem made the decision not to return home, when his chaperones refused to guarantee that he would be safe upon returning to his country.

After skipping his return flight, Abdullah told Al-Jazeera he feared being rearrested.

'In case I get back to Egypt, my future will be in jail, considering that I am threatened all the time to be detained,' the boy said.

Farida Chehate, an attorney with the Los Angeles-area Council on American-Islamic Relations, said her group will help the teen apply for amnesty with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services.

She said the teen may also be accused of setting fire to cars belonging to police officers, although Chehate has yet to see Egyptian authorities’ reports.

'He’s somewhat politically active,' Chehate said. 'He has posted on Facebook and formed a group. His feelings have put him on the wrong side of the government.'

Chehate said media coverage of Abdullah’s apprehension in April apparently motivated the government to allow him to attend last week’s International Science and Engineering Fair. She said the boy’s family supports his asylum effort.

'We’d hope the family is not in jeopardy' since Abdullah’s arrest attracted extensive Egyptian media attention, she said.

The boy’s father, Assem Mohammed, told Egyptian news agencies that his son did not perform well in last week’s fair 'because he didn’t have enough time to prepare' for judging. 'He made his presentation with handwritten notes. He didn’t even have time to type it on a computer.'

Some $5 million in cash prizes and scholarships were awarded at the competition’s end.

Abdullah, a senior at Dar Heraa Islamic Private School in Assiut, Egypt, was scheduled to take his final high school exams this week.

Sharon Rummery, a spokeswoman for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in San Francisco, said her agency would not be authorized to discuss an asylum application, even if one had been filed on behalf of Abdullah.

There are five criteria for asylum, which can lead to citizenship, and two of them are fear of political leanings and membership in a social group, she said.

Rick Bates, interim chief executive of Washington, D.C.’s Society for Science & the Public, said he knows of no previous situation where a high school student participating in a fair has defected at the end of the competition.

'I don’t know that we have a reaction,' Bates said. 'The young man and his family have made that decision.'

Annual science fairs have been conducted since 1950, and the event began including international high school students in 1958.

After Abdullah arrived in Los Angeles on May 12, 'I think he had a normal week,' Bates said. 'He did indicate that he wanted to stay and look at colleges.'

Abdullah is staying with a family friend in the Los Angeles area while his bid for asylum is considered.

He refused to speak about his family in Egypt for fear that they will become targets of the government.

'I can’t continue my life,' he told The New York Times. 'I am a normal person. They are killing innocent people - this is what I am against.'

'I don’t have any political inclination at the moment,' he wrote on Facebook on May 18, while in Los Angeles. 'But I absolutely reject the blood, and I’m against the massacres that occurred in Egypt during the past period just like anyone who respects humanity.'
