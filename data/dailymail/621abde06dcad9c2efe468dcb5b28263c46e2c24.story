Until yesterday, Carol Thatcher’s tousle-haired companion’s only regular exposure to British politics was confined to the annual Parliamentary skiing competition in Klosters.

Marco Grass, 43, is a leading ski instructor in the Swiss resort and regularly puts British MPs through their paces before the contest with their Swiss counterparts.

His place in the Thatcher family line-up was a surprise even to some of Lady Thatcher’s closest friends.

A daughter's grief: Carol Thatcher is comforted by partner Marco Grass and her brother Mark's wife, Sarah, at Mortlake Crematorium after yesterday's funeral

Rarely seen in Britain, let alone photographed with Carol, he has studiously avoided any publicity since the pair met on the Alpine slopes in 1992.

He has been a constant and discreet companion ever since, though the exact nature of their relationship is ambiguous.

They were certainly a romantic item initially. Yet Carol, who at 59 is 16 years his senior, said on one of the few occasions she has talked publicly about Marco: ‘One day I’m sure he will vanish into the distance with someone younger and prettier.’

Two years ago, Marco broke both his legs in a skiing accident, and Carol nursed him back to health.

Yesterday, however, as Carol emerged hesitantly from the official car outside St Paul’s, it was easy to see that it was his moment to support her.

Support: Although Grass, 43, is rarely seen in Britain, let alone photographed with Carol, yesterday he was constantly by her side during the funeral

As she walked up the aisle of the cathedral, Carol looked distracted and tense and repeatedly darted her head in Marco’s direction for reassurance.

In contrast, only once — and then just briefly as they earlier walked up the cathedral steps — was there physical contact between Carol and her twin brother, Mark. He touched her arm just at the moment her face crumpled with emotion.

Sitting in the front row pew, she constantly clasped and unclasped her hands, crossed her legs over each other and back again, fanned herself with her Order of Service and re-arranged her hat. She showed all the outwards signs of inner unease.

On the cathedral steps after the service, as they waited for the hearse to take away their mother’s coffin, Carol and her brother stood apart, almost symbolically, in the family group — separated by their respective partners.

For years, the twins were barely on speaking terms. Carol was always closer to her father, Sir Denis, who died in 2003, while Mark was always his mother’s favourite.

‘They rarely see each other but put on a good show when they are on public parade,’ said a friend of Carol. ‘The truth is that there is little between them.

‘Carol would have felt very isolated without Marco. In fact, I don’t think she could have got through the service without him.’

When they first became an item, Marco, whose family were hoteliers, lived in Carol’s riverside apartment in Fulham, West London, and she referred to him as her ‘lodger’. He soon became an occasional guest at her parents’ house in Chester Square, Belgravia.

Mischievously, Marco would ask Lady Thatcher if she thought Switzerland should join the EU, knowing that it would trigger one of her famous political diatribes on the subject of Europe.

He also got on well with Sir Denis, who advised him to emulate his example: stay out of the limelight and never give interviews.

Marco followed that advice to the letter. Indeed, until the funeral, only a handful of Carol’s friends knew what he even looked like.

Lady Thatcher would have been pleased that Marco was at St Paul’s because she knew that he made Carol happy and that he has never embarrassed her family.

Sir Denis would also have approved, as Marco is a consummate party host back in Klosters, where he and Carol own a small, stylish apartment. Carol divides her time between the Swiss resort and an apartment in Madrid, where she is learning Spanish.

Her flight home to Switzerland would also have earned the approval of the famously thrifty Iron Lady. Carol and Marco will leave as they arrived in Britain — on an EasyJet budget flight.
