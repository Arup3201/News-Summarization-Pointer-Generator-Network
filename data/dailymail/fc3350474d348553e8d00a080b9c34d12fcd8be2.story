Embattled Stephen Belafonte has emerged defiantly wearing his wedding ring amid reports his marriage to former Spice Girl Mel B is on the brink of collapse.

The 39-year-old film producer, who has denied claims he beat his wife, was pictured with their daughter Madison, three, at a Los Angeles cafe on Wednesday.

Belafonte is believed to have flown to the US on Sunday while Mel - who has remained silent on the abuse claims - is in the UK having just finished her judging duties on British talent show X Factor.

Sparking allegations: Belafonte has denied beating wife Mel B after she appeared on The X Factor on Sunday for its live final, sporting what appeared to be a swollen face, a bruise on her cheek and scratches on her upper arms

The allegations unfolded after Mel B, also 39, appeared on the show's Sunday live final, sporting what appeared to be a swollen face, a bruise on her cheek and scratches on her upper arms.

Within minutes of the show starting, Twitter was awash with extraordinary claims, pointing the finger at Belafonte - Mel's husband of seven years.

Mel, who was not wearing her wedding ring, had previously been rushed to hospital on Thursday, causing her to miss Saturday's live X Factor show.

2000: Accused of assaulting two men in a row on a highway, and according to initial charges he threw a missile of some sort at their car. The assault case was reduced to vandalism after he agreed to pay for the damage caused to the vehicle.

2003: Admits domestic charge linked to drunken attack on his partner Nicole Contreras. Later said he admitted it when 'confused' but the conviction stuck

2007: Two months after marrying Mel B he admitted battering a mallard to death with a brick.

2010: Involved in brawl with three men in exclusive London hotel. One man went to hospital. Mel B said he was defending her. Police were called but no charges brought.

A week on, the America's Got Talent judge is still to comment on why she was admitted to hospital.

She has not been seen in public since her appearance on television on Sunday night.

On Friday, The Sun reported that Mel is lying low in London and has changed her phone number.

Her husband is said be concerned the furore could 'severely damage' his reputation.

But Belafonte - who has a string of previous convictions, including assault - spoke exclusively to MailOnline on Wednesday, addressing allegations he beat his wife. 

'No one has accused me of anything,' he said, adding that this is 'not the first time' he's been branded a violent thug.

When asked about the speculation of domestic abuse, Belafonte said: 'Who accused me of it, did she accuse me of it, the police, the hospital, who accused me of it? I thought when you beat someone up the police or the hospital or the person you beat up says it.'

He predicted to MailOnline that the media storm currently surrounding him would be ‘gone in a second’.

He added: 'I mean come on, how long will it take, two weeks a month, two months, a year. It's totally around me, it's not big news, it's not all over the newspapers here (in the US)… it's not a big massive story.'

Belafonte, who is believed to be staying in the couple's Los Angeles home, was asked by MailOnline whether his wife had left him, following the reports that she had walked out on their relationship.

'I already said that on my Twitter,' he said, although MailOnline could not find any references to his marriage by Belafonte or his reps on the social networking site.

The Sun reported earlier this week that Mel B had packed up and left the couple's London home after their furious arguing became too much to bear.

On Monday morning a furious Belafonte hit back, saying: 'I don't usually respond to Twitter msgs but I will respond to comments of hitting my wife which I think are quite disgusting un true!

'Mel was very ill a bunch of doctors helped her get better if fans can't just relax B4 being negative they r not real fans of @OfficialMelB.'

In 2007, shortly after his marriage to Mel B in June that year, it emerged that Belafonte had been charged with battery in America after being arrested for attacking his then girlfriend, Nicole Contreras.

He pleaded 'no contest' to the battery charge – which the judge stated was the same as a guilty plea – and was ordered to take part in a Domestic Violence Batterers' Programme. 

In 2007 Belafonte admitted to battering a mallard to death with a brick.
