Arsene Wenger has urged star man Alexis Sanchez to produce a big performance away from the Emirates Stadium in his battle with Sergio Aguero on Sunday.

Two of the deadliest attacking threats in the Barclays Premier League go head-to-head when Arsenal travel to Manchester City. Sanchez has been a revelation since joining from Barcelona in a £30million summer move, scoring 18 goals for the Gunners.

However, only four of those have come away from home, while he was not quite up to his usual high standards in the matches at top-four rivals Liverpool and Chelsea.

‘Yes, at Chelsea and Liverpool he wasn’t at his best,’ admitted Wenger. ‘It’s maybe because the team has not been as effective away from home, because when you are a striker you depend a little bit on how much your team pushes forward.

‘But he can use that as a motivation to play well on Sunday. As a team we didn’t play well as we would like (against Liverpool and Chelsea) and it was difficult for the strikers to get good balls. But he has had some good away games, too.’

Arsenal legend Thierry Henry — who will make his debut as a Sky Sports pundit for the clash at the Etihad Stadium — said this week that Sanchez has the potential to be Wenger’s best ever signing.

Producing a match-winning display against Manuel Pellegrini’s side on Sunday would further those claims.

‘It’s difficult to compare Laurent Koscielny, for example, with Sanchez,’ said Wenger. ‘All the signings we made this year were good. Sanchez is one of the better ones, but you have to consider the price you pay as well to decide that because we paid good money for him.

‘But whichever way you look at it, he is good value for money. He is one of the fastest to adapt to the Premier League. I believe it’s because he feels accepted by the other players, that he feels he is an important player.’

Victory against the champions will provide Wenger’s men with a huge confidence boost in their attempts to finish in the top-four.

Their record against English football’s elite remains a concern for Wenger, who admits three points over City could be a pivotal moment in their season.

‘We are going through a period where confidence is important,’ said the Frenchman.

‘So a big performance could be decisive. I feel we have to play with a bit more freedom. From every big game you gain confidence when the result is good. Let’s focus on going there and giving ourselves a chance to win by putting a great performance in.

‘We want to have a good balance between attacking and defending because we know that City attack very well.’

Meanwhile, Wenger confirmed the signing of Legia Warsaw midfielder Krystian Bielik, pending a successful medical. Bielik arrived in London on Friday to complete his move.

Wenger insists the fee for the 17-year-old is less than the £2m that has been touted — but admitted it was a hefty sum to fork out for one so young.

‘It’s an awful lot of money for a player if he doesn’t succeed,’ said Wenger. ‘If he does succeed then it’s cheap. He’s a defensive midfielder, 6ft 2in, he has a good energy level and technical level. It’s a gamble. But on what we saw it’s worth to take the gamble. He will go straight into the first-team squad.’
