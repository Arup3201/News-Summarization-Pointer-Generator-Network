Horrified witnesses screamed at 30-year-old Jesus Rodriguez Rojas to stop inappropriately touching his four-year-old niece and immediately told police, authorities said on Friday.

Rojas has been arrested and charged with sex abuse and injuring a child.

NY1 reports that Rojas was riding on the Q53 bus in Queens with the young girl when he allegedly started touching her in a sexual manner.

Witnesses say they saw Rojas engaging in the perverse behavior and yelled at him to stop.

The child has been taken to the hospital for evaluation.

It is unknown whether or not the child will be placed with her other family members at this time.
