New charges: Alleged 'Hollywood Ripper' Michael Gargiulo, 35, is now accused of killing a young woman in Chicago in 1993

A man tagged the 'Hollywood Ripper' who is suspected of killing the former girlfriend of actor Ashton Kutcher has been charged with murdering another woman 18 years ago.

Air conditioner repairman Michael Gargiulo, 35, is already facing trial over the violent stabbing deaths of two female victims.

Now investigators in Chicago claim he also stabbed Tricia Pacaccio to death after she returned home after a night out with friends in 1993.

Prosecutors say the killing shows a similar pattern to the February2001 slaying of 22-year-old Ashley Ellerin, who was then Mr Kutcher’s girlfriend.

The actor, now married to Demi Moore, told Los Angeles police that Miss Ellerin never came to the door when he went to her Hollywood Hills home to pick her up to go to a post-Grammy Awards party.

Her bloodstained body was found later inside the house.

Gargiulo is also being held for the December 2005 stabbing of Maria Bruno in her El Monte, Los Angeles apartment.

According to police in Chicago, Gargiulo was a family friend of 18- year-old Miss Pacaccio, who was found by her father in August 1993 on the step of her Chicago home after she had been stabbed 12 times.

He lived a block away from the Pacaccios and had long been a suspect because a small amount of his DNA was found under her fingernails.

But it wasn’t enough to bring charges until the case was featured on the CBS show ’48 Hours.’

According to a statement released today by prosecutors in Cook County, two men came forward after the show to say that Gargiulo had confessed to them that he’d carried out the killing.

They said he told them he’d stabbed a girl in Chicago and left her for dead on the steps of her home.

Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart said in the statement: ‘Our detectives have been committed to this case and never once wavered in their belief that we would one day be able to bring justice to it.

‘It is our hope that those who knew and loved Tricia can find some measure of peace as a result of this'.

Gargiulo was arrested in 2008 after allegedly stabbing a Santa Monica woman who fought with an intruder who broke into her home.
