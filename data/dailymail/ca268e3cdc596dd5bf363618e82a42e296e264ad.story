A pedestrian walking home at 5am Wednesday morning was recorded being completely bowled over by the force of a snowplow in Brooklyn, New York.

The footage was taken by security cameras inside and outside a car dealership on Coney Island Ave in Sheepshead Bay.

The man is seen walking down the street when a snow plow comes barreling down the road pushing a huge wall of snow that knocks him to the ground.

Early morning pedestrian: This man was probably making his way to work in Brooklyn when a speeding snowplow approached

Wall of snow: The snow can be seen arcing away from the plow as it approaches the man

Cold shower: The man is almost consumed by the snow

The plow was coming towards the pedestrian so quickly he didn't have time to move - not that moving would have helped him.

According to JM Legend Auto Group, the force of the wall of snow actually smashed their glass doors in.

Staff arrived at the dealership to find dirty snow and broken glass inside the showroom and watched security footage to see what had happened.

The unsuspecting pedestrian got up from the icy ground and shook the snow off himself before picking up something he dropped and hobbling off.

Buried: The pedestrian can't be seen for all the snow covering him

Wall of snow: The plow driver made no attempt to slow down after knocking a pedestrian off his feet

It is unclear if he was injured by the snow and slush that knocked him to the ground.

The Department of Sanitation is investigating whether the snow plow was part of the city's fleet of sanitation trucks.

Bad start to the day: The man clambers to his feet before continuing on his way, no doubt a lot colder and wetter than he was before

A storm Wednesday and subsequent snowfall left the New York City a mess of dirty snow, slush and ice.

The ongoing inclement weather in New York City has caused problems for new Mayor Bill DeBlasio, with residents from all over the city unhappy at efforts to clear snow this winter.

On Monday in another plowing incident, a 73-year-old man was tragically killed when a snowplow reversed into him as it was cleaning snow in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn.
