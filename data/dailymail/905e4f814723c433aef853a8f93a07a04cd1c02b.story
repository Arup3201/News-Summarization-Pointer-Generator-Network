Amir Khan has warned Kell Brook and his promoter Eddie Hearn that they will have to play second fiddle if there is to be another Battle of Britain at Wembley Stadium.

Khan, in Las Vegas preparing for Saturday's clash of former world champions with American Devon Alexander, will only agree to fight Brook 'on my terms.'

Brook, who is recovering from being stabbed in the leg while on holiday, is a potential fall back opponent for Khan next year if Floyd Mayweather continues to renege on his promise of giving Bolton's favourite son the mega-fight of his dreams.

But Khan is angered by Hearn going public with an offer of $5million (£3.2m) and will not concede Brook the thick end of the purse which usually goes to a defending world champion.

He says: 'I respect Kell for winning his title but the fact is that I would be the main draw if we fight and he will have to accept that.'

Of Hearn, who staged the biggest fight in modern British boxing when Carl Froch knocked out George Groves in front of an 80,000 crowd at Wembley earlier this year, Khan says: 'Who is he to tell me how much he will give me to fight Kell?'

Brook has long been seeking a showdown with Khan, who says: 'That fight could happen but only under the complete control of Khan Promotions, on my terms and conditions. We will choose where and when it takes place and I will decide how much I am paid. I dictate my purse for my big fights.

'It was disrespectful of Hearn to say what my purse would be. I will only fight Brook if it makes financial sense, if the public genuinely want it and if a fight for me with Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao doesn't materialise.'

Khan is hoping to make such an emphatic statement against Alexander on his first top-of-the-bill appearance at the fabled MGM Grand Garden in Las Vegas that Mayweather will finally be forced to fight him.

The Money man, who is widely regarded as the best pound-for-pound boxer in the world., failed to make good on a promise to fight Khan this year.

Khan pulled out of a world welterweight title challenge to Alexander a year ago on the understanding that he would meet Mayweather in May. Since then Alexander has lost the title and Saturday's fight is one neither man can afford to lose.

Khan, who twice lost his own world titles, acknowledges: 'I can't afford to make another mistake but although I'm still young in boxing terms I'm now older and wiser.'

The prize of a mega-millions challenge to Mayweather is again tantalisingly close for Khan and he says: 'I need to make a statement against Alexander which mobilises the public in America to put pressure on him to fight me.'

Khan remains keen to fight Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao in 2015

There is a sense in the US that Khan would be the only viable alternative for Mayweather if he continues to prevaricate about meeting Pacquao in what would be the richest fight of all time.,

The world has been waiting years for that and Khan says: 'It would be great for boxing for those two to fight each other but obviously it would upset my plans. I've been waiting a long time for Floyd.'

He also suspects that Mayweather is wary, saying: 'A lot of people over here, including my Hall of Fame promoter Oscar De La Hoya, are saying that my speed would give Mayweather a lot of problems and that I could be the first boxer to defeat him.

Khan beat Luis Collazo on points in his last fight back in May

'I want the biggest fights and would also be happy to box Pacquiao but to be honest I think Mayweather would be an easier fight for me style wise.'

Then he reassures his army of fans: 'Don't worry. I'm not looking past Alexander. I'm excited about boxing at the MGM and there are giant posters all over the Vegas Strip to remind me of how big this fight is in its own right.'

Amir Khan v Devon Alexander will be televised live Saturday night on Sky Sports.
