A man who has hiccuped constantly has received the devastating news there is probably no cure and he could have them for life.

Daniel Clavin, 38, spoke out last year to appeal for help in finding the cause of his chronic hiccups.

Now, he has been diagnosed with the neurological condition multiple sclerosis and believes the illness could be responsible for his hiccups.

Daniel Clavin (pictured with his wife, Susan) has had chronic hiccups for almost three years

He began suffering constant hiccups after a night out and the problem is now ruining his life.

He has to sleep in a separate room to his wife, is embarrassed about going anywhere in public and struggles to eat normally.

He said: ‘They’ve taken over my life and I don’t know if I’ll ever get rid of them.

‘Now I’ve been diagnosed with MS I think that’s the reason for them.

‘They are not a common symptom of MS but MS can affect your brain in lots of different ways.

‘I’m told I’ve got a high burden of the disease and this is the only symptom so far, so I can’t complain.

Mr Clavin has tried every trick that could possibly stop his hiccups but nothing has worked

Mr Clavin (pictured eating sugar and vinegar in a bid to stop his hiccups) has recently been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. He believes the neurological condition is responsible for his hiccups

‘But MS is a progressive disease so I don’t know if I’ll ever be cured of them.’

Mr Clavin’s hiccups began in July 2011 after he went on a stag do.

He said: ‘I just woke up with them and I’ve no idea why they started.

What is MS?

MS is a neurological condition that affects nerves in the brain and spinal cord.

It causes a wide range of symptoms including problems with muscle movement, balance and vision.

Each nerve fibre in the brain is surrounded by a layer of protein called myelin which protects the nerve and helps signal from the brain travel to the body.

In MS this fibre becomes damaged disrupting these nerve signals.

Usually, people with MS have flare-ups of symptoms for a few days to a few months followed by periods of few symptoms.

After about 15 years, half of patients then develop secondary progressive MS in which symptoms gradually worsen over time.

There is currently no cure but treatments can help control the symptoms.

MS is an autoimmune condition which occurs when the immune system starts attacking the myelin covering of nerves.

MS is usually diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 40 and life expectancy is five to 10 years less than in the population as a whole.

MS and hiccups:

Some experts believe the damage that occurs to the central nervous system as a result of MS can result in the body losing its ability to control hiccups.

But, it is a rare way for MS to present - one study suggested about eight per cent of MS patients struggle with hiccups.

‘I’m not a big drinker and I’d had more than I’d for some time but it was nothing out of the ordinary.

‘Since then I’ve tried just about everything - all the old wives’ cures - but I can’t stop.

‘Some days are bad and I’ll have difficulty eating and keeping my food down.

‘Other times they lock up my diaphragm and I won’t be able to breathe for 30 seconds.

‘I spend most nights in a different room from Susan so she is not disturbed but that’s not ideal and it puts a strain on things.

‘I can be lying there for hours, hiccupping every three seconds.’

Mr Clavin is currently seeing a neurologist who has prescribed chlorpromazine, a drug normally used to treat schizophrenics.

That has failed to stop the hiccups - but appears to have reduced them to a regular on-off pattern.

He said: ‘I’ll have them for seven or eight days and then they’ll suddenly stop and I’ll be without them for five or six days and I’ll be perfectly fine.

‘It’s been like that for several months now and I don’t know if it’s because of the drug.

‘I’ve got another appointment with the neurologist in a couple of weeks when he says he’s going to put me on an anti-epilepsy drug to see how I react to that.

‘There’s also the possibility of having a pacemaker fitted in my diaphragm which would interrupt the signal from my brain and hopefully stop them.’

Despite the problem, Mr Clavin says he has been able to keep his job as a software worker with British Telecom.

He spends a couple of days a week in their Dublin office and the rest of the time at home in County Roscommon, Ireland.

He said: ‘My work colleagues are very good and very tolerant and I do everything I can to keep the hiccups quiet.

‘I find I can control them best and hold my breath if I’m not talking so I try to keep quiet.

‘People find it quite funny when they first meet me but then it becomes quite annoying for someone to have to listen to.

‘I to try to keep cheerful but the medical community doesn’t seem to know what to do for me.

Mr Clavin (pictured with his wife, Susan, and children, Harry and Megan) believes that as there is no cure for MS he could have his hiccups for the rest of his life

‘I’m told there’s only a handful of people in the world at this moment who will have hiccups as bad.’

Mr Clavin - father to Harry, four, and 20-month-old Megan - has seen a number of experts, had two endoscopies, a CT scan, changed his diet, taken tranquilisers and consulted a chiropractor but all in vain.

His wife, Susan, 39, said: ‘It’s a big struggle.

‘I try to block it out but I can’t sleep with it - the sound and the constant twitching of the bed.

‘Even when he’s having a good week it’s hard having him back in the bed because I’ve got used to sleeping by myself.

‘It is very tough on him and day to day he’s not very happy, although he tries to remain positive.

‘It’s difficult for anyone to concentrate on anything else when he’s around.

‘We are still desperate to find someone who can help him because the hiccups are ruining our lives.’

Jo Chapman, Information Resources Manager, at the MS Society said: 'People with MS can experience chronic hiccups, which may be caused by having MS, but this link isn’t proven.

'No two cases of MS are the same and the condition can present itself with a wide range of different symptoms.

'We wish Daniel and his family all the best for the future and would encourage him to get in touch if he would like and support or further information about the condition. Our helpline is 0808 800 8000.'
