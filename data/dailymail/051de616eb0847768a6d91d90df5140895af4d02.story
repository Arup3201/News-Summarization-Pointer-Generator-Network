It is the image that sums up international relations in the internet age.

Analysis of more than ten million emails has revealed which countries get along and which do not.

A team of computer researchers have studied millions of emails from Yahoo! Mail and have discovered that emails are most frequently sent between countries with certain similarities.

A team of computer researchers have studied millions of emails from Yahoo! Mail and have discovered that emails are most frequently sent between countries with certain similarities.

The researchers analysed emails over a period of 6 months in 2012.

They worked out the user's location from their IP address, and anonymised the data so users could not be traced.

The research, by Stanford University, Cornell University, Yahoo!, and Qatar’s Computational Research Institute, suggests that how many emails are exchanged between two countries is dependent upon their relative GDP, language and trade relations.

The study also revealed that countries with tangible ties – such as a shared border, regular interconnecting flights, and close trade relationships – share the most emails.

In the journal ArXiv the researchers wrote: ‘The ﬁndings (unsurprisingly) support the idea that geography, transportation and administrative decisions are all important determinants of between-country communication: distance decreases density, as do visas, while direct ﬂights increase it.’

However, there were some surprises.

The
 research revealed that people in different countries of the European 
Economic Area email far less than the scientists predicted.

It also showed that people in countries with colonial ties do not email more as a result.

The researchers wrote: ‘Our ﬁndings in the main model with respect to contiguous borders and common European Economic Area membership appear surprising, as they decrease rather than increase density.'

The US (left) unsurprisingly has strong links with the rest of the world. Latin America (right), however, appears almost as an 'island' at the bottom of the image

‘These curious ﬁndings do raise the issue of potential problems with European integration, as well as of the higher potential for conﬂict between countries sharing borders, which may lead to less communication.

'In The Clash of Civilizations, Samuel Huntington argued that the primary axis of global conflict was no longer ideological or economic but cultural and religious, and that this division would characterize the 'battle lines of the future.

'We focused on the flows of interpersonal communication as a bottom-up view of international alignments.

'To that end, we mapped the locations of the world’s countries in global email networks to see if we could detect cultural fault lines.

'Our analysis shows that email flows are consistent with Huntington’s thesis.'

In addition to location in Huntington’s “civilizations,” our results also attest to the importance of both cultural and economic factors in the patterning of inter-country communication ties.'
