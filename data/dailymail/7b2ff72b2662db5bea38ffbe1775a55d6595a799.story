An ultra-fit California couple intends to soon take their hardcore fitness lifestyle to the next level by rowing a boat 2,400 miles from Monterey to Hawaii.

Tech entrepreneur Sami Inkinen, 38, and his former competitive gymnast wife Meredith Loring, 34, if they complete the grueling feat, will become the first couple to ever successfully make the trip across the mighty Pacific.

But short of being scared to undertake a task only ever completed by a handful of adventure seekers, Inkinen and Loring are more afraid of what it may do to their relationship.

Ultimate challenge: Sami Inkinen his wife Meredith Loring are pictured training for their Monterrey to Oahu trek across the Pacific in just a row boat

'It's going to be uncomfortable. We'll be sleep-deprived and hungry and sore, so it will be easier to cross boundaries that we don't want to cross,' Loring told SFGate.com.

Her husband agreed: 'The mental side is going to be the most challenging. How we deal with ourselves and with each.

But these are two people accustomed to pushing boundaries and coming out on top.

Finland native Inkinen started the real estate website Trulia in 2005 while pursuing his MBA at Stanford. He also became a competitive triathlete during that time.

Loring grew up competing in gymnastics in New Hampshire and after receiving a master's, she had a successful run with a company that sells software to investment banks.

Their decision may not be so surprising when you learn they met on Match.com before making a kayaking date in Sausalito their first meeting.

The excursion will mark their fourth wedding anniversary.

Inkinen and Loring want to become the first couple to row from Monterey to Hawaii

Fit: Inkinen is one of the world's greatest amateur triathletes in his age group and Loring recently won the women's division of a marathon in Nepal dubbed 'the world's highest trail running event.'

The sporty couple had never rowed before they decided to cross the Pacific, but were very much in shape going into their new training

Inkinen is one of the world's greatest amateur triathletes in his age group and Loring recently won the women's division of a marathon in Nepal dubbed 'the world's highest trail running event.'

Currently, their focus is on rowing, though neither had any experience with the sport before the decided to make the trip.

'Both of us were looking for a new and difficult adventure that would push our mental and physical capabilities,' said Inkinen.

'The longest I've spent rowing was six hours, and that was in a 35-pound shell, not a heavy boat like Sami and Meredith are going out in,' said Shirwin Smith of the Sausalito rowing center.

'But they have gone about their training and preparation in a really disciplined way. They were super fit to begin with, but they came here to get the right form. They learned and practiced in the heaviest boats we have,' she said.

Death to sugar: Their website Fatchancerow.org will track their progress and serves as a place where donors can give money to help with the couple's pet cause - ending the epidemic of world sugar consumption

Their water-tight boat and cabin will come stocked with a desalinator that will allow them to safely drink seawater.

They'll also have all the food they'll need, a GPS system, emergency beacons, and a radar system to warn them of oncoming boasts.

Several others have made the trip from West Coast of America to Hawaii in a row boat.

A man made the trip from Washington state in 1976 and another did the same in the 1980s.

Roz Savage was the first woman to row from San Francisco to Oahu, and did it in 99 days.

For their chosen route, the record is 64 days, set by Mick Bird in 1997.

'I don't think it's crazy, but it is an aggressive challenge,' Ray Dean of the San Francisco Dolphin Club told the SFGate.com. 'The mental strain is hard to imagine. It's like living locked in your car and you can't get out.

'It's a little boat in a very big ocean.'
