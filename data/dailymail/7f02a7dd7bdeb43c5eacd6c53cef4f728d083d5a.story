FOX News President Roger Ailes has never been afraid to voice his disdain for liberals and has called President Obama 'lazy' and said that while the president's second-in-command is lovable, Joe Biden is 'dumb as an ashtray.'

His no-holds-barred assessment of the Obama administration came in a new excerpt released today from a forthcoming book about the cable news mogul, Roger Ailes: Off Camera,  by Zev Chafets.

It's a well known fact that there is no 
love lost between FOX News and the left but Chafets' piece portrays a side of Roger 
Ailes that is rarely seen, the man as a father, husband and a human who lives with a very real sense 
of his own mortality.

A man and his empire: Roger Ailes founded the FOX News Channel in 1996 and it has grown to become the most watched cable news network

Mr Ailes delivered his scathing criticism of Mr Obama during the 2012 presidential election in response to the comments made by Democratic strategist Hilary Rosen, who said Anne Romney had 'never worked a day in her life.'

'Obama’s the one who never worked a day in his life. He never earned a penny that wasn’t public money,' Ailes said, according to the excerpt published in Vanity Fair magazine

'How many fund-raisers does he attend every week? How often does he play basketball and golf? I wish I had that kind of time. He’s lazy, but the media won't report that.'

No love: Ailes called President Obama (left golfing on Martha's Vineyard in 2010) lazy and said Vice President Joe Biden (right at a campaign stop in Concord, N.H.) was dumb

As the founding president of the news network owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, Mr Ailes has built FOX News from a fledgling channel created in 1996 to become the most watched cable news channel.

He is a formidable force inside News Corp. and enjoys what Mr Murdoch has described as a 'close personal friendship' with the media mogul.

But the newsman demurred, insisting that his survival at the global conglomerate is based on his ability to make a profit.

'Does Rupert like me? I think so, but it doesn’t matter,' he said.

'When I go up to the magic room in the sky [Murdoch's office on the eighth floor at News Corp. headquarters in New York] every three months, if my numbers are right, I get to live.'

'If not, I’m killed. Our relationship isn't about love - it's about arithmetic. Survival means hitting your numbers. I've met or exceeded mine in 56 straight quarters. The reason is: I treat Rupert's money like it is mine.'

Though Ailes has successfully maintained FOX News as a cash cow for the Murdoch empire, their relationship became strained when Murdoch's son-in-law, PR exec Matthew Freud, said the family was 'ashamed and sickened' by Ailes.

Freud, the second husband of Rupert's 44-year-daughter Elisabeth, made the comments to the New York Times in 2010 but Rupert was quick to downplay the remarks and said through a spokesman that he was 'proud of Roger Ailes and FOX News.'

Mr Ailes gave Zev Chafets unfettered access to his personal affairs, a rare move by the media mogul known for his extreme distrust of outsiders, that has even been described as sheer paranoia.

Chafets visited the powerful businessman at his office in midtown Manhattan at FOX News headquarters, his family home in Putnam County in upstate New York and at various outings, including watching his son at a school basketball game.

The father of one son, 12-year-old Zachary, Mr Ailes, 72, speaks openly about his realization that he won't live forever and voices his fear that he will not live to watch his son grow.

'I'd give anything for another 10 years. My doctor told me that I’m old, fat, and ugly, but none of those things is going to kill me immediately,' he said.

'The actuaries say I have six to eight years. The best tables give me 10. Three thousand days, more or less,' he predicted.

'I’m not going to be here forever and I want Zac to know me.'

In preparation, he has been creating memory boxes of momentos to leave behind. So far he has stuffed letters, pictures and memorabilia into nine plastic crates for Zac.

Among the tokens include a pocket-size copy of the U.S. Constitution, a picture of Zac's mother, Beth, a press release about Ailes and a biography of Ronald Reagan.

'This is advice Zac might need to hear from me in 10 years and I won't be here to give it to him,'  he said about his collection.

'I’ve told him, if he has a problem or he feels he needs me, to go off to a quiet place and listen, and he will hear my voice.'

Ailes was diagnosed with hemophilia when he was a child and said that from an early age he had to come to terms with the prospect of dying.

'I've been prepared to face death all of my life...So I'm ready. Everybody fears the unknown. But I have a strong feeling there's something bigger than us. I don’t think all this exists because some rocks happened to collide. I'm at peace. When it comes, I’ll be fine, calm. I'll miss life, though. Especially my family,' he said.

When probed about the afterlife, Ailes said he thinks he and God will get a long just fine - until the interviewer presents a problematic scenario.

'What if you get there and it turns out that God is a liberal?' Chafets asked him.

'Well, hell, if God’s a liberal, that’s his business,' he said.

'But I doubt very much that he is. He’s got a good heart.'

Family: Roger Ailes married his third wife Beth (right) in 1998. They have one child, a son Zachary, now 12

Mr Chafets had previously profiled conservative icons including radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee.

The chapter from his book was published in Vanity Fair this month, just weeks before his full project, Roger Ailes: Off Camera, is released on March 19.

In May, New York magazine reporter Gabe Sherman will release his own book about Ailes, The Loudest Voice in the Room: Fox News and the Making of America.
