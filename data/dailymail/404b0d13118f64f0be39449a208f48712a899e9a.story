Patti LaBelle, pictured in 2007, has agreed to the $100,000 settlement, according to Roseanna Monk's lawyer

Disco diva Patti LaBelle has paid a $100,000 settlement after a pregnant mother accused the singer launching a foul-mouthed tirade in front of her 18-month-old daughter because the toddler was playing in an apartment building lobby.

The Grammy-winning singer allegedly lashed out at Roseanna Monk and little Genevieve at their New York home, calling the woman a 'c***' and drenching the woman with a water bottle.

LaBelle, 68, had also been accused of screaming at the toddler and trying to punch her mother in a profanity-laden rampage so furious it that it is said to have caused Genevieve to vomit violently.

During the alleged altercation, Ms Monk said she put down her 
daughter to carry luggage out of the building. When Ms LaBelle walked in
 and saw the child running around the lobby, she went ballistic, 
according to the suit.

'What
 are you doing letting your kid run around like that?' the Marmalade singer asked Ms 
Monk, a kindergarten teacher who was pregnant at the time.

When
 Ms Monk picked Genevieve up, Ms LaBelle, herself a mother of five 
children, admonished her for leaving her daughter by the door.

Now following the alleged outburst in 2010 the singer has paid out a $100,000 settlement before the case was deposed.

Ms Monk's lawyer told the New York Post the case has been settled between the mother and LaBelle.

Ms Monk said all proceeds would be donated to the Hope and Heroes Children's Cancer Fund.

She said: 'This is an opportunity for Patti LaBelle to help a lot of children, and I feel good about that.'

The Monks said the incident they say took place in the lobby of their Upper West-side apartment building.

Lady Marmalade singer LaBelle reportedly had to be dragged away by her entourage after the confrontation two years ago

Ms Monk told the New York Post she responded: 'I have no interest in what you say or think.'

The diva, who was dressed in a fur coat and over-sized sunglasses, started hurling profanities at Ms Monk and her baby, according to the lawsuit.

Ms LaBelle then threw water from a water bottle in the baby's face.

When Genevieve started to cry, Ms Monk told her: 'Are you happy that this is what you have done to this baby?'

That's when the singer, known for hit songs including I'll Be Your Friend, 'tries to take a swing' at Ms Monk, the couple's attorney Sam Davis told the New York Daily News.

Ms. LaBelle's entourage restrained her and shuffled her off into a waiting car.

The couple said they didn't want to sue. First, they asked the singer, who was staying at the New York apartment building while she worked on the Broadway show 'Fela!', for an apology.

But they decided to file a lawsuit after reading about an incident in Houston where Ms LaBelle's bodyguards were arrested for beating a West Point cadet in March.
