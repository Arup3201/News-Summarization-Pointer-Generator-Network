Adam Johnson is set to start for Sunderland in Dick Advocaat’s first game in charge at West Ham on Saturday.

The winger returned to training on Wednesday after the club lifted his suspension following his arrest on March 2 on suspicion of sexual activity with a 15-year-old girl.

The Black Cats took the decision to allow Johnson to return after his bail was extended to April 23.

And the 27-year-old flew to London with the rest of the squad last night ahead of the game at Upton Park.

Advocaat has worked with Johnson at the Academy of Light this week and he took part in a full-scale practice match on Thursday.

When asked during his unveiling press conference if Johnson would play at West Ham, Advocaat said: ‘Everyone who is training is available for selection.’

Advocaat has inherited a side one point and one place above the drop zone. The Dutchman, however, has never been relegated in his 27-year managerial career and does not intend to add demotion to his CV at Sunderland.

‘I have never been relegated and always have the feeling that I will never go down,’ he said. ‘So I don’t really want to talk about relegation.’
