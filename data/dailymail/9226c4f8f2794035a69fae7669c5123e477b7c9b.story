A kitten which holds an uncanny resemblance to Batman has been left at an animal rescue centre. 

Thanks to unusual markings on his face, this black and white moggy is reckoned to be a spitting image for the comic book hero by staff at the RSPCA centre in Swansea, South Wales.

And he's even been named Bruce after the caped crusader's millionaire alter-ego Bruce Wayne as played by Christian Bale and George Clooney.

A kitten which holds an uncanny resemblance to Batman has been left at an animal rescue centre in Wales. 

The animal charity are now looking for a new home for the adorable cat who looks like he is wearing Batman's mask.

Cat lover Susan Chambers said: 'I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw him, he looks just like batman.

'I just hope he doesn't get his hands on Robin.'

Black and white kitten Bruce currently lives at an RSPCA centre in Swansea, South Wales.

Centre manager Gary Weeks said he is one of 150 cats who they are trying to rehome.

Mr Weeks said: 'We are looking to re-home 50 cats at least, we are looking for new homes for cats.

'They have been neutered, microchipped and are covered with insurance for four weeks.'

Anyone able to take a cat in should contact the centre on 01792 229435 or www.rspca-llysnini.org.uk
