The son of a man killed in the 7/7 London bombings has sued his mother after she spent his entire £50,000 compensation.

Adam Gray was just 11 when his father Richard died in the suicide bomb attack near Aldgate station on July 7, 2005.

The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority gave his mother, Louise, £250,000, Adam £50,000, and £100,000 to his sister, who did not wish to be identified.

When Mr Gray reached 18 he was given the money, but asked his mother to look after it for him until he was older.

However, less than two years later she admitted she has spent every penny.

She allegedly squandered it on shopping sprees, luxury clothes, top restaurants and redecorating her home and garden in Ipswich.

When his mother failed to repay the money, Mr Gray, 20, took her to court – and a judge at Northampton County Court has now awarded him £43,750. Mrs Gray is appealing the ruling.

‘I feel sick it had to happen,’ said Mr Gray. ‘Not only have I lost my beloved dad in the most tragic circumstances but I’ve lost my mother too. Finding out my dad had died was unimaginable. In that moment my life changed for ever.

‘My mum lost her husband, which will have a big effect on somebody, but she is a grown woman who took money her son entrusted her with.’

His father, a 41-year-old tax expert, was one of seven passengers murdered on a Circle Line train by Bradford-born bomber Shehzad Tanweer.

The 7/7 suicide attacks on packed Tube trains and a bus killed 52 people and injured 700 more – the UK’s worst ever terrorist attack.

Mrs Gray later met the Queen at a St Paul’s Cathedral memorial service for victims and survivors.

Mr Gray blames the large compensation payout on changing his mother’s personality. She quit her job as a carer and went on spending sprees that included five new cars, seven chihuahuas and a hot tub.

‘After my father died she became a lavish spender,’ he told the People. ‘Most people would be excited by a life-changing amount of money – I was scared of it. When she agreed to look after it, I thought it was in safe hands.’

It was only when he asked for some money to fund a move to London for an apprenticeship that Mrs Gray confessed she had spent it.

‘Naturally, I trusted her because she was my mother. Trying to understand how my mother could do it with such ease is difficult. And to think she spent it on materialist rubbish is very hurtful.’

Mrs Gray said she begged her son to forgive her.

She said: ‘It’s true that I spent his money. I didn’t spend it on all the fancy things – that came before, when I had the compensation for my partner.

‘It’s all a mess. I’ve said sorry to my son over and over again but he won’t listen to me. He’s still my son so I want to talk to him and explain.

‘The judge says I have to pay it all back straight away but I can’t, so that’s why I’m appealing.’
