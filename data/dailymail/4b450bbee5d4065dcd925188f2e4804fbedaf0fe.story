The traditional Christmas dinner of turkey and all the trimmings contains as much as 900 calories - and that does not even include pudding.Â 

Now two chip shops owners believe they can take festive gluttony to a new level.

Andrew Doughty and Chris Christoforou are offering a fast-food version of the traditional feast - complete with battered sprouts, roast potatoes and carrots.

The Bearwood Fish Bar, in Smethwick, near Birmingham, have created a deep-friend Christmas dinner served in a bun.

The trimmings are wrapped in turkey breast and doused in batter.

They also offer battered mince pies and Christmas pudding.

Mr Doughty said: 'I think we'll have a decent take-up on the mince pies and the pudding, but I don't think as many people will try the Christmas dinner.

'Even so, it's a challenge for the team and you never know what the response will be.'

Not to be outdone, Mr Christoforou, who owns the Hollywood Fish Bar, in nearby Wythall, is planning to serve a burger consisting of a turkey crown, stuffing and cranberry sauce, covered in gravy - with battered Christmas cake for pudding.

Mr Christoforou, 31, who runs the take-away with his wife Nicki, said: 'I'm really pleased with the burger.

'It's a complete Christmas meal - without the sprouts.

'It's the ideal thing to bite into while watching the Queen's Speech or Great Escape.'

The seasonal special - to be rolled-out in the next two weeks - is the latest in a line of culinary stunts dreamed up by Mr Christoforou.

At Easter he served up battered Cadbury Creme Eggs.

He said: 'Everyone tells me I should be in PR.'

A battered cheeseboard is also in the planning stage, with the working title 'Cheeses of Nazareth'.

And turkey and cake are not the only Christmas fare in danger of getting the Hollywood treatment.
