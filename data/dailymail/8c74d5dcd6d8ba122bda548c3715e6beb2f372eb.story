If you’re stuck up a tree, it’s nice to know you can rely on your big brother to help you down – even if it means standing on his head.

The lion had climbed into the tree in search of some shade but ended up clinging on after his cheeky brother dragged him down.

But the joke soon backfired on the bigger brother, who ended up being used as a sturdy platform by the younger sibling.

He ain't heavy, he's my brother: The stranded lion stands on his sibling's head

The two lions, named Echo and Etosha, left onlookers at Antelope Park in Zimbabwe roaring with laughter.

Although they are both related, Echo is better known for his pussycat demeanour, while Etosha has a reputation for being a fearless hunter.

Photographer David Jenkins, 40, was the only person to snap the big cats in action but thankfully the only thing that took a bruising was the lion's pride.

David, from Dublin, Ireland, was one of a lucky handful of people who managed to witness the comical moment and said: 'Echo had no trouble getting into the tree but was not so confident climbing down until his brother arrived.

That looks nice and cool... can I have a turn? The brother approaches the shady tree spot

Sting in the tail: The lion's nap is disturbed when Echo is pulled out of the tree by his tail

'It was really funny to watch as Echo got himself more and more into trouble.

'He was hanging from the branch by his front paws and was clearly searching for some solid ground under his back legs, until eventually he found his brother's head.

'They are both extremely playful with each other but they have very different personalities.

'Echo is very friendly and very lazy while Etosha is a great hunter - he always comes back to look for his sleepy brother.

'Lion cubs love to climb but it becomes more difficult as they get bigger and heavier.'

I'm not gong anywhere! Determined Echo clings on for dear life as Etosha looks around... then gets stomped on

Don't worry, I've got you! Eventually Echo loses out to the power of grrrr-avity

Its brother decided he wanted to have some fun, so pulled him from the tree... but it did not go quite to plan
