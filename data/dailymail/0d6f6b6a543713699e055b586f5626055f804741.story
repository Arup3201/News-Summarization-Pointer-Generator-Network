Bodybuilder: Davey Fallon died after losing his grip and plunging two floors from the bedroom window of his flat

A bodybuilder high on drugs and intoxicated from alcohol died after plunging from his second floor flat, as he tried to climb through the bedroom window after an argument.

Davey Fallon suffered serious head injuries when he lost his grip on the windowsill and fell.

The 20-year-old used a wheelie bin to climb on to the porch roof. From there he he was trying to clamber through the bedroom window.

An inquest heard the bodybuilder, who worked at a gym in Warrington, had argued with his girlfriend Leanne Chadwick, hours before he fell at the home in Warrington, Cheshire, in the early hours of July last year.

Miss Chadwick, 31, said she was woken in the early hours by banging at her bedroom window.

She told the inquest: 'As I looked towards the window I saw a white vest and I asked him what he was doing?

'Then he just disappeared. One minute he was there and the next minute he wasn't.'

A row erupted between the couple as they headed home after enjoying a day with friends at the Glastonferry festival.

Miss Chadwick, who had lived with Mr Fallon for about a year, left without him at around 10.30pm on July 6, the inquest heard.

She locked him out, telling him to go back to his family home on Newton-le-Willows.

His friends told the inquest he was 'very drunk'.

'He just disappeared': Miss Chadwick, 31, was woken by banging at the bedroom window. She said: 'As I looked towards the window I saw a white vest and asked him what he was doing. Then he just disappeared.'

In addition, a toxicology report revealed Mr Fallon also had traces of cocaine in his system - although his girlfriend said he was not a regular drug user.

A Cheshire police officer working with paramedics battled to save the 20-year-old.

He was taken to Warrington Hospital, where doctors failed to save him and he was later pronounced dead.

The death was ruled as misadventure by Deputy Coroner Dr Alan Moore, at Warrington Coroner’s Court.

Dr Moore agreed Mr Fallon's drug use was 'out of character', but added the drug is likely to have played a part in the 20-year-old's death.

'Go home': Miss Chadwick locked her boyfriend out of the Warrington flat they had shared for a year, telling him to go back to his family home

He said: 'One of the effects of 
cocaine is increasing confidence.

'One of the others is increasing risk 
taking.

'We know that Davey climbs onto the roof to get to the window. 
That was clearly a risk.

Miss Chadwick said she loved how he was with her and her son, and that they had a ‘happy relationship’.

Mr Fallon's father, David Fallon paid tribute to his son, adding he ‘lived life to the full’.
