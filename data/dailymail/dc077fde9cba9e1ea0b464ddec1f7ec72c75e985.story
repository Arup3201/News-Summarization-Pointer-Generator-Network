Frankie Essex is the latest TOWIE star to turn her hand to designing as she unveils her range of colourful party dresses and she's already got her eye on a certain customer.

Speaking to MailOnline about her new range, Frankie said: 'My new dresses are classy with a sexy twist. I have some going out party dresses, a few casual looks for daytime and some sexy playsuits for the summer. They are all great quality and I am really happy with the finished product.

'I love the Kim Kardashian look and she 
looks amazing in bandage dresses. I've heard she reads MailOnline so 
if you see this Kim, let me know if you want any of my collection.'

Fashion designer: Frankie Essex, who found fame as Joey's sister on TOWIE, has designed a range of party dresses (£75)

Frankie has created her 11 pieces with both her own style and a woman's silhouette in mind.

'I am known for wearing bandage dresses and I get a lot of tweets about them so this collection is definitely me.

'The reason I wanted to have these styles is because I am a curvy girl and they accentuate your curves.

'If you aren't massively curvy it will help you achieve the "curvalicious" look. I am hoping all girls will look and feel good in my clothes,' she said.

There's a red plunge-neck dress, grey tunic style design and rainbow print bodycons, which Frankie hopes will flatter all body types.

Beauty aficionado: Frankie says she has toned down her look since her early TOWIE days but still couldn't live without her make-up bag

Speaking about her personal style and how she was influenced by her late mother, she said: 'My style is very classic. My mum was a very stylish woman and she always read Vogue.

'When I first started on TOWIE I used to wear very heavy make-up but I have calmed that down as I suit natural so I suppose my clothes reflect that.'

Despite her new natural look, Frankie couldn't live without her make-up bag.

'My make-up bag is my life! If I
 lost it I would be fuming and cry. My main items are lipgloss, foundation and blusher. That’s all I need.'

Frankie is just one of the many TOWIE girls to unveil a clothing collection, so is it competitive between the designers of Romford?

High fashion: 'Speaking about her personal style and how she was influenced by her late mother, she said: 'My style is very classic. My mum was a very stylish woman and she always read Vogue' (jumpsuit, £45)

'We have similar dress sense and we 
all love clothes. I would love to see some of the girls in my brand. I 
wear Cara Kilbey's collection as we are really good friends and have a similar style.'

Frankie is currently coveting Sam Faiers' look and says the blonde is looking 'beautiful' lately.

As for the boys of Essex, she reckons Diags is dressing 'really nicely' and maintains that she'd never change her brother Joey's 'individual' style because he 'always looks great'.

Flattering: There's a red plunge-neck dress, grey tunic style design (£35) and hot pink reversible playsuits (£35), which Frankie hopes will flatter all body types

Speaking about her style icon, Frankie said: 'It would be a cross between Victoria Beckham and Kim Kardashian with a hint of Carrie Bradshaw from Sex And The City.

'Victoria Beckham has the smart classy look, Kim Kardashian has the curves and Carrie Bradshaw is a girly dresser and she loves shoes like me.'

Since leaving the ITV2 show, Frankie has already set her sights on a fashion and beauty empire.

'I am concentrating on my businesses. As well as the dresses I have a hair company called Frankie Essex Hair and it's just over a year old.

'I have some other exciting news coming out this week so watch this space.'

Siblings: Frankie said she would never change Joey;s style because he 'already looks great'
