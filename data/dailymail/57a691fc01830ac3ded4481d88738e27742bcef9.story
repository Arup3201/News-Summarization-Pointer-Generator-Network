Russian President Vladimir Putin has fired a top Russian Olympic official after publicly ridiculing him on a visit to the winter Olympics site.

In an attempt to stamp his authority on the event he sacked Akhmed Bilalov, 42, vice-president of Russia's Olympic committee, after becoming annoyed that the ski-jump was not on schedule.

The current price tag for the Sochi Games is 1.5 trillion rubles ($51 billion), which would make them the most expensive games in the history of the Olympics - more costly even than the much-larger Summer Olympics held in London and Beijing.

Pressure: Next year Games are even more costly than even than the much-larger Summer Olympics held in London and Beijing

The games at the Black Sea resort of Sochi are considered a matter of national pride and one of Putin's top priorities.

Putin's decision came after he 
scolded officials over a two-year delay and huge cost overruns in the 
construction of the Sochi ski jump facilities.

The Russian official involved, Akmet 
Bilalov, had a company that was building the ski jump and its adjacent 
facilities before selling its stake to state-owned Sberbank last year.

During his tour of Olympic venues, 
Putin fumed when he heard that the cost of the ski jump had soared from 
1.2 billion rubles ($40 million) to 8 billion rubles ($265 million) and 
the project was behind schedule.

So a vice president of the Olympic Committee is dragging down the entire construction? Well done!

You are doing a good job,' Putin said Wednesday, seething with sarcasm.

Deputy
 Prime Minister Dmitry Kozak told reporters Thursday that Putin had 
recommended that the Russian Olympic Committee fire Bilalov, one of its 
six vice presidents.

'As far as Bilalov is concerned the 
president voiced his decision yesterday: People who don't make good on 
their obligations at such a scale cannot head the Olympic movement in 
our country,' he said.

Most countries that host the Olympics
 use public funds to pay for most of the construction of the sports 
venues and new infrastructure like roads and trains.

The Russian 
government, however, has got state-controlled companies and tycoons 
to foot more than half of the bill.

Assurances: Despite these setbacks, Russian officials today went to great lengths to reiterate that everything in Sochi was now on schedule

Priority: The games at the Black Sea resort of Sochi are considered a matter of national pride and one of Putin's top priorities

Both the companies and the tycoons 
understand the importance of maintaining good relations with Putin, who 
has a lot of prestige riding on the success of the Sochi games.

Kozak said the costs constantly 
increased for the ski jump project because Bilalov's company did not 
properly check the land and, as a result, picked a geologically 
challenging plot.

'His calculations failed,' Kozak said.

The Russian Olympic Committee was 
quoted by Russian news agencies as saying that Bilalov's future can only
 be decided by a session of its executive committee.

Despite these setbacks, Russian 
officials went to great lengths to reiterate that everything in 
Sochi was now on schedule.

'As IOC members and we stated 
yesterday, it is already clear that we have succeeded with this immense 
and possibly the most immense project in Russia's modern history,' Kozak
 said.

Taking a cue from Putin, however, Russian officials sought to
 play down the high costs. Kozak said the government spent no more than 
100 billion rubles ($3 billion) on the Olympic venues and the immediate 
infrastructure.

The government has spent a total of 
$13 billion so far, and expects to spend about $18 billion overall 
before the games begin, Kozak has said previously.

On Thursday, Kozak said it was unfair
 to compare Sochi's budget to that of previous Olympic games because 
Russian organizers had to build most of the vital and costly 
infrastructure that was needed - roads, railways, tunnels, gas pipelines
 - from scratch.

No Russian officials went near the 
topic of possible corruption, even though Russian business is 
notoriously plagued by it. Russia last year ranked 133rd out of 176 in 
Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index, along with 
countries such as Kazakhstan, Iran and Honduras.

Although there were no documented 
cases of corruption directly linked to Olympic construction in Sochi, a 
dozen officials from the Sochi government have been slapped with charges
 of corruption in the past year.

Kozak and Sochi officials insist that
 they're keeping the situation under control and that no money is being 
stolen at Olympic sites.

Sochi organizers also sought to 
assuage fears that the 2014 Games may fall victim to a warm and snowless
 winter - or a howling blizzard.

Temperatures at Sochi's Krasnaya 
Polyana ski resort hovered at 59 degrees Fahrenheit (15 degrees Celsius)
 on Thursday, and reached 66 degrees F (19 C) in the coastal city of 
Sochi.

That's after a cold snap the previous
 week in which athletes competed in test events amid snowstorms as 
temperatures dipped to 20 degrees F (-6 C).

Dmitry Chernyshenko, head of the 
local organizing committee, said Sochi boasts one of one Europe's 
largest snow-making systems and also has equipment that can store snow 
throughout the summer and protect slopes and tracks from rain and fog.

More than 400 snow-making generators will be deployed on the slopes.

He said Sochi has special equipment that can make snow even in temperatures up to 59 degrees (15 C).

'Snow will be guaranteed in 2014,' Chernyshenko declared.

Warm temperatures and rain disrupted 
some of the snowboarding and freestyle skiing events at the 2010 Winter 
Games in Vancouver.

The countdown celebrations were to 
culminate later Thursday in a star-studded ice show at one of the 
Olympic arenas, attended by Putin and IOC President Jacques Rogge.

Also Thursday, tickets for the games went on sale online in Russia.

The prices range from a low of 500 
rubles ($17) to a high of 50,000 rubles ($1,700). Organizers said about 
40 percent of the tickets would be priced under 3,000 rubles ($100).

The total number of tickets put on sale was not disclosed.

In a bid to combat ticket scalping, 
Sochi organizers said they would limit the number of tickets that can be
 bought by one person. For the most popular events, such as the opening 
ceremony and top ice hockey games, the limit would be four tickets per 
person.

Sochi organizers will also require 
visitors to apply for a special spectator pass without which they will 
not be able to access the venues.
