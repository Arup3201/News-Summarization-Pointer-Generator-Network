Remorse: Pete Townshend has apologised for swearing at a seven-year-old fan during his concert

Pete Townshend has apologised for telling a   seven-year-old fan and her father to 'f*** off' during his concert in Ontario, Canada.

The Who star upset Jenny Costello when he targeted her and her father at a show after spotting her homemade 'Smash Your Guitar, Pete!' sign. 

According to the Toronto Sun Jenny was sat on her father Eric Costello's shoulders 
waving the colourful placard.

In video footage posted online the musician can be heard saying, 'Go away with that sign please, just go away with it, just go away with it.

'Don't bring your children... I want to tell you two words but I can't because you've got a child there.'

The guitarist, wearing a white blazer with a red handkerchief, then mouthed the words "F*** off!" at Mr Costello.

The father was offended by the obscenity and left the concert early with his young daughter.

The special education teacher had spent a week's salary - nearly $300 (£199) - on the 15th-row floor tickets.

He said he was horrified by the 67-year-old rocker's actions - especially because Townshend is his daughter's idol.

'Nobody talks to my seven-year-old daughter like that,' Mr Costello later told the Toronto Sun.

'I expect a 70-something-year-old man to respect the fact there's a seven-year-old girl standing in front of him.'

According to the Sun News Network, Townshend
wrote a letter to Jenny which read 'Apologies and condolences from my 
side, and very best wishes to you and your family.'

The letter continues: 'I could tell you that I am so sorry the story about us blew up the way it did, but also to tell you that I sympathize with you both, and your daughter's mother, and that I am most certainly not angry. I was not angry on stage either. I was in rock star mode, the big mouth. I could have handled it differently.'

The British guitar great is now hoping to meet the child and her father, so they can 'put this behind us.'

In the letter he invites the pair to meet him at Stratford Shakespeare Festival in 'more agreeable and safer circumstances,' to watch a Broadway version of TOMMY from 1993.

Mike Tyler, a DJ for the classic rock station Giant FM 91.7 in Hamilton, told UPI.com: 'I was surprised at the whole thing because it's really nothing like Pete,' Tyler said of what happened at the Hamilton concert.

'He is a very friendly person. He invited my family to the Hamilton show and genuinely felt bad about what transpired and wanted to make it right.'

Townshend ended his letter by making a promise: 'I will not swear.'

While he doesn't expect rock stars to be on their best behaviour, Mr Costello insists they need to use common sense, especially at all-ages shows.

He said he would consider bringing his daughter to see The Who again in the future, but only if Townshend has his mouth washed out with soap.

'I don't want people to think I'm exploiting the situation,' he said. 'I don't want anything out of this. I would appreciate an apology from Pete Townshend, but I certainly don't expect one.'
