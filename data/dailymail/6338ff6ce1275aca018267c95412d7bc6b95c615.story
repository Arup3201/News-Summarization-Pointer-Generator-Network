The Imitation Game trailed close behind with eight nominations. 

Clint Eastwood's Navy SEAL drama American Sniper did especially well, landing six nods including best actor for Bradley Cooper. 

Angelina Jolie's WWII epic Unbroken was not recognized, and other snubs included Jennifer Aniston for Cake, Amy Adams for Big Eyes and the animated film The Lego Movie.

Best Picture nomination: Birdman received nine nods in total, one for Best Picture, it was announced on Thursday morning by the Academy Of Motion Pictures Arts And Sciences

On the list: The Grand Budapest Hotel, starring Ralph Fiennes, also got a nod

Up for Best Picture: Boyhood, starring Ellar Coltrane (left) and Ethan Hawke (right) was recognized

There were theories about this: The drama The Theory Of Everything got a nomination too; it stars Eddie Redymane and Felicity Jones as Stephen and Jane Hawking

On the list too: Selma, starring Colman Domingo, David Oyelowo, André Holland and Stephan James, was produced by Brad Pitt's Plan B Entertainment and Oprah Winfrey

Also with six nominations was Richard Linklater's coming-of-age epic Boyhood, which remains the best-picture favorite. On Sunday, it won best drama at the Golden Globes.

But Wes Anderson's old Europe caper The Grand Budapest Hotel, which also won best comedy or musical at the Globes, has emerged as the most unexpected awards heavyweight.

Mr. Turner

With $59.1 million at the North American box office (opening all the way back in March), it's also the most money-making best-picture entry. 

That, however, is likely to change soon after American Sniper expands nationwide this weekend.

The eight best-picture nominees left out two wild cards that might have added a dose of darkness to the category: the creepy Jake Gyllenhaal thriller Nightcrawler and the tragic wrestling drama Foxcatcher. 

She won a Golden Globe this year already: Julianne Moore in the film Still Alice; she received a nod

In the three previous years since the category was expanded (anywhere between five and 10 film may be nominated), there were nine movies contending for best picture.

The nominees for best actor are: Cooper, Steve Carell (Foxcatcher), Benedict Cumberbatch (The Imitation Game), Michael Keaton (Birdman) and Eddie Redmayne.

David Oyelowo, who stars as Martin Luther King Jr. in Selma, was left out.

There was not a single person of colour nominated in the acting or directing categories.  

Marion Cotillard for the French-language Two Days, One Night was the surprise nominee for best actress. She was joined by Felicity Jones (The Theory of Everything), Julianne Moore (Still Alice), Rosamund Pike (Gone Girl) and Reese Witherspoon (Wild).

The nominees for best supporting actor are: Robert Duvall, The Judge; Edward Norton, Birdman; Mark Ruffalo, Foxcatcher; Ethan Hawke, Boyhood; and J.K. Simmons, Whiplash.

The nominees for best supporting actress are: Patricia Arquette, Boyhood; Laura Dern, Wild; Keira Knightley, The Imitation Game; Emma Stone, Birdman; and Meryl Streep, Into the Woods.

A long trek for this Oscar winner: Reese Witherspoon, who took home the gold for 2005's Walk The Line, was nominated for playing Cheryl Strayed in Wild

This year's modestly sized but much-beloved favorites - Boyhood, Birdman - have been largely locked in place throughout much of the ever-expanding industrial complex of Hollywood's lengthy awards season, where statuette-hunting campaigns span months and are feverishly chewed over by Oscar prognosticators. 

As studios have focused more and more on easily marketed blockbusters, Oscar season increasingly exists apart from the regular business of the movies, in its own highfalutin, red-carpeted realm.

Ratings are on the rise. Last year's Oscars, hosted by Ellen DeGeneres, drew 43 million viewers, making it the most-watched entertainment telecast in a decade. 12 Years a Slave took best picture. 

This year's ceremony on Feb. 22 will be hosted by Neil Patrick Harris. 

He will be at the Oscars in February: Clint Eastwood's Navy SEAL drama American Sniper did especially well, landing six nods including best actor for Bradley Cooper

A bright future for this newlywed: Redmayne received a Best Actor Oscar for The Theory Of Everything

Golden boy: Hawke, pictured with Coltrane, got a nod for Boyhood; he already picked up a Golden Globe Best Actor Drama award for the part

Shortly after the announcement, the host shared a video on his Twitter page.

He told his 12.9million followers: ‘The Oscar nominations just came out this morning and that can only mean one thing – I just lost 20 bucks.’

Neil then turned to his four-year-old daughter Harper and handed her the cash, claiming he had bet on who would be up for Best Credit Design Of A Foreign Language Film – a made up category. 

The new host: Neil Patrick Harris is taking a stab at hosting the 87th Academy Awards on February 22
