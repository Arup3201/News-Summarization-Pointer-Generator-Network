Robert Graves the soldier-turned-poet, (pictured in 1967), twice turned down the offer of an honour from Downing Street

Robert Graves used his Claudius novels to warn of the dangers of becoming too close to the centre of political power in Ancient Rome.

But newly released documents show that the soldier-turned-poet was equally sceptical about modern politicians – and twice turned down the offer of an honour from Downing Street.

Graves feared that his artistic independence would have been jeopardised if he had accepted either of the honours offered to him by two different Tory Prime Ministers – Harold Macmillan and Margaret Thatcher.

His reluctance to embrace the honours system is revealed in Cabinet Office letters obtained by this newspaper under Freedom of Information laws.

They show that other writers and artists, including Roald Dahl, Francis Bacon and Lucian Freud, also turned down honours.

Graves, who died in 1985 aged 90, refused Harold Macmillan’s offer of an OBE in 1957.

In a letter to Downing Street on May 10, 1957, he wrote: ‘I sincerely hope that the Prime Minister will not consider me churlish or ungrateful if I decline his proposal.

'My reason is that I am primarily a poet, and poetry is a private activity which in my opinion should not be recognised by the award of an honorific appropriate to public servants.’

Artists Francis Bacon, left, turned down a CBE in 1960, and Lucian Freud, right, declined a CBE in 1977 it has emerged.

The writer, who served as an Army officer in the First World War, added: ‘I am content with the three campaigning medals awarded me by Her Majesty’s Grandfather [King George V] for my services as a soldier only.’

Graves later rejected Margaret Thatcher’s plan in May 1984 to enrol him as a Companion of Honour. He was in poor health and his wife Beryl declined the honour on his behalf.

The writer’s son Robert said last night: ‘My father turned down the honours because he didn’t want to be beholden to anyone.

'He thought artists should have complete independence so they could speak their minds.’

Roald Dahl’s rejection of an OBE in 1986 was abrupt. He wrote: ‘I refer to your letter . . . telling me my name is being considered . . . This is to inform you that I do not wish to accept.’

Francis Bacon had turned down a CBE in 1960, saying: ‘I do not want my name now or ever to be recommended to Her Majesty for such an honour.’

Lucian Freud declined a CBE from Labour’s James Callaghan in 1977, writing: ‘I am grateful to the Prime Minister for his kind thought . . . Although unable to accept this honour, I hope it will be understood that I have come to this decision for selfish reasons.’
