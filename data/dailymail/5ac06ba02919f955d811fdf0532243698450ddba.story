It looks like any other office building in New York's Financial District.

But 27 Cliff Street has a little more to it than the steady drone of keyboard-tapping and murmured phone calls.

It is home to a raucous swinger sex club - and the police claim they are powerless to shut it down.

Unsuspecting: This grey office building in New York's Financial District houses a raucous swingers club

The Amsterdam Society, based on the third floor, describes itself as 'the sexist place around' that is 'one part Ibiza style-night club and one part playboy mansion'.

It hosts 'wild weekly events' that have enraged their neighbors - three tech companies and a research business. 

According to the New York Post, the NYPD raided the premises on September 19, but found the antics to be legal as the participants are not paying for the service.

They handed the group a summons for selling alcohol before leaving them to continue the event.

The club's next event 'Freaky Friday' charges an entry fee of $80 to couples and $20 to ladies - and $120 to 'select men'.

It advises participants to 'get naked and have fun' after having their body painted.

They are told 'bring your own lock' and there will be 'adult toy giveaway' at some point during the event.

Week night: Workers have blasted the group for the smell and noise left by their parties during the week

On Mondays, guests are treated to a free buffet served by a 'sexy bartender' before they 'dance, drink and watch football'. 

And the building's other tenants are not happy about it. 

'This is an office building. We saw them move eight mattresses up there!' one worker told the Post.

'That was horrendous.'

Another said: 'We come in in the morning and you can smell cigarette smoke in the halls.

'We found drugs in the lobby. There's condoms in the trash in the back.

'It's horrifying.'

A third raged: 'If they can go that long, God bless them, but we shouldn't have to hear it.'

The owner of the building has now filed a lawsuit again the Amsterdam Society, which allegedly claimed to be a video production company when they signed the lease.
