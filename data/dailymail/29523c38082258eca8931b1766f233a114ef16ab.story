Many of her peers glistened in elaborate gowns at Sunday's ceremony.

But Julia Roberts opted to keep it simple yet sleek in a plunging black Givenchy jumpsuit as she attended the 21st Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards at The Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on Sunday.

The 47-year-old actress appeared sophisticated chic in a 3/4-sleeved onesie which hugged her curves at all the right places.

Sophisticated chic: Julia Roberts displayed her lean figure in a plunging black Givenchy jumpsuit as she attended the 21st Annual Screen Actors Guild Awards at The Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles on Sunday

The Normal Heart star paired the elegant number with black peep-toe platform stilettos while adding some glitz with jewels from Tiffany & Co - diamond drop earrings, an ornate diamond and platinum bracelet, and coordinating diamond ring.

Julia recently revamped her thick tresses by tinting them with her signature red hue, and for Sunday's ceremony, she styled her lustrous locks in loose curls.

The Pretty Woman beauty appeared to be in high spirits, and it's no wonder, as she was one of the evening's honoured attendees.

We do love any event where there's a red carpet and a whole host of celebrities and we love it even more when Julia Roberts shows up. She took to carpet in a black jumpsuit, ready to find out if she'd won an accolade for her performance in The Normal Heart. Sadly, it wasn't meant to be for Julia, but that doesn't lessen her in Fashion Finder's eyes.

Being the face of Givenchy, it was no surprise she rocked up in the brand's wool jumpsuit. With its satin lapels and detailing and plunging neckline, it was definitely red carpet material.

We weren't convinced the fit was perfect for the superstar, but it went unnoticed as she otherwise looked stunning with her red locks falling around her shoulders.

If you want to bag your own jumpsuit, you can snap it up to the right - but hurry as there's very few left.

The award-winning actress was nominated for the SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a TV Movie or Miniseries for her role as Dr, Emma Brookner in The Normal Heart.

Though, Frances McDormand was the actress to take home the honour for her work in Olive Kitteridge.

Julia's co-star Mark Ruffalo was also nominated for his outstanding performance in The Normal Heart - and did indeed win.

The actress had the honour of presenting the award for Best Actor to Eddie Redmayne and took a moment to praise him before J.K Simmons swooped the gong for Whiplash.

She said: 'I just wanted to say that Mark Ruffalo is one outstanding actor. And I am just tickled to my toes that he won tonight.'

The HBO movie takes place in the 1980s in New York and follows a writer (Mark) and his friends, as they join forces to expose the truth about the emerging AIDs crisis to both the government and the gay community.
