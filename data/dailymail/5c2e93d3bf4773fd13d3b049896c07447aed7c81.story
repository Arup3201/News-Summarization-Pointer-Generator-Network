Brendan Rodgers has teed up Liverpool’s trip to Manchester United by declaring: 'this is more than just a game'.

The Reds boss finds himself under sustained scrutiny for the first time since taking over at Anfield two years ago and won’t want a defeat against United adding to the club’s list of woes this season.

In fact, Rodgers believes the intensity of this fixture could be just the tonic for a side finding it difficult to find the net without the injured Daniel Sturridge.

‘It's more than a game. You are representing a city. Today on the training field out job as staff was to lift the spirit. The game against Manchester United is perfect for us,’ Rodgers said.

‘You perform better when you are happy and confident but we can't dwell on it. You just have to refocus the minds of the players and get them focused on a great opportunity.

‘They know what is expected of them. They are playing for Liverpool. You always look at the next game as the start point. I know what I am working with in terms of the players. With confidence, we will get results. We don't compare to anyone. We are just focused on being strong ourselves.’

Rodgers asserts that he is ‘more determined to succeed’ and says he is giving Mario Balotelli every chance to prove his fitness before Sunday.

‘It's very important game, always is, ' Rodgers explained. 'A massive game in the fixture list and we want to do well,’ he added. ‘We will assess Mario. He has looked good in training but we will see how he is. Adam Lallana looks fully up to speed. I hadn't mentioned as I wanted to protect him. We are looking to improve our performance level.’

And the manager has no problems with winger Raheem Sterling amid talk of contracts, saying: ‘If you look at Raheem's performance, that will do the talking. He loves being at the club.

‘There is certainly no unhappiness. I see him train, I see him play. It is up to the club and his representatives to get things sorted out.’
