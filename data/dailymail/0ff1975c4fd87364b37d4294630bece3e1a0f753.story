A morbidly obese woman was told by doctors that she risked being permanently paralyzed as a result of her weight, just weeks after undergoing gastric bypass surgery. 

Susan Farmer, 37, who is the latest subject of TLC's obesity series My 600lb Life and weighed more than 607lbs when she was at her heaviest, underwent the procedure at the recommendation of a specialist, however soon after lost all feeling in her legs.

'I've been doing anything to get better and this doesn't feel fair at all,' Susan, who was forced to lose more than 100lbs before being able to undergo the procedure, said. 'But I will not end up in a wheelchair.'

Morbidly obese: Susan Farmer, 37, was told by doctors that she risked being permanently paralyzed as a result of her weight, just weeks after undergoing gastric bypass surgery

Drastic measures: Susan weighed more than 607lbs when she was at her heaviest, and had gastric bypass surgery on the advice of a specialist

Fear: Susan, who was forced to lose more than 100lbs before being able to undergo the procedure, was determined not to end up in a wheelchair

Susan was diagnosed with a nerve condition known as neuropathy, which often affects people who are overweight or obese, leaving them with severely damaged nerves. The condition must be treated immediately after diagnosis, otherwise the sufferers are at risk of permanent paralysis. 

'A specialist saw Susan and she has been diagnosed with a condition called neuropathy,' obesity specialist Dr Nowzaradan explains. 

'This condition is nerve damage that can be the result of being obese for a long time. Susan is losing weight but she is still going to suffer from the effects of being so heavy for so long.

'It can be permanent so we need to treat it immediately and make sure she doesn't lose any muscle.' 

Prior to her surgery, doctors warned Susan that she was at serious risk of severe illness, injury - and even death - as a result of her obesity.

She explained that life had become completely 'miserable', and that she was unable to look at herself in the mirror because she hated her own reflection so much.

'Life is miserable,' she explained. 'I hurt all the time so I don't get up much. With me having this big stomach, it falls on me so bad and it feels like my skin is on fire. 

'I have trouble breathing, especially when I'm walking. I have to take baby steps, because I am afraid of falling. And if I fell, there is nothing anybody could ever do for me.

'I don't like looking at myself, so I don't look at myself in the mirror. To me, I am fat and ugly. All I see is a fat glob. I'm just disgusted about the way I look.' 

Susan's mother Nita admits that her daughter first began putting on weight at an early age, after turning to food as a form of comfort in reaction to her parents' unstable relationship. 

'When Susan was about four or five, me and her dad started fighting a lot,' she explained. 'He was an alcoholic, he would come home drunk, and somebody was going to get hit. It was either me or Susan.'

'I would just eat,' Susan added. 'I don't know if I was eating to make me feel better. I just ate because the food was there.' 

Recovery: Susan went into rehab after the surgery to get stronger both physically and mentally

On the mend: Susan had been at risk of her paralysis becoming permanent

Emotional: Susan first began putting on weight at an early age, after turning to food as a form of comfort in reaction to her parents' unstable relationship

Depressed: Susan said life had become completely 'miserable', and that she was unable to look at herself in the mirror because she hated her own reflection so much

Despite her mother's belief that her daughter would grow out of her over-eating, Susan continued to indulge, turning to food whenever she came up against a problem in her life - a dangerous habit which left her severely overweight and at serious risk of a variety of health issues. 

And while Susan began to see some progress in the short weeks following her gastric bypass surgery, she admitted that being diagnosed with a condition which meant she was unable to move around left her feeling unable to make any further progress.

But after putting on some of the weight which she had lost following her surgery - prompting a serious lecture from her doctor - Susan finally finds the motivation that she needs to continue her weight loss journey. 

'I've been thinking about being in a wheelchair, and using that as motivation to keep going,' she says, shortly after being submitted into a rehabilitation facility, where she had to learn how to walk all over again. 

'The surgery was my second chance at life. And I'm not going to let a setback like this take that from me. I'm going to fight. I'm going to do everything I possibly can to get better.

'Even though I'm back at square one, I am not giving up. If I lose my ability to walk I'm going to end up gaining everything back.

Bad habits: Susan first began comfort eating at the age of four, when her parents began fighting

Then and now: Prior to her surgery, Susan weighed more than 607lbs (L), however she manages to get her weight down to an impressive 340lbs a year after her first visit to the doctor (R)

'And then I'll just be waiting to die. It's my life that's at stake.' 

More than a year after her first visit to Dr Nowzaradan's office, Susan returns for her final weigh-in, which reveals that she has managed to lose a staggering 267lbs in total, leaving her weighing 340lbs.

'I can't believe it,' she told the cameras shortly after stepping off the scales. 

'I'm very proud of the progress that I've made so far. A year ago I was barely walking. Right now, my world has changed. And I'm starting to get my life back.

'This year has been the most difficult year of my life. BUt everything I've gone through in losing this weight has been worth it.

'I will never go back to the way I was. I've come too far. I'm enjoying life and I'm happier than I've been in a long time. It feels so good to have a reason to smile again.'
