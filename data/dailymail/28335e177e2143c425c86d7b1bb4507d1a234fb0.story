President Barack Obama
said in a TV interview set for broadcast on Sunday that he will
do 'everything I can' to close the U.S. military prison at
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, after four Afghan detainees held there
were sent home.

Obama promised to shut the internationally condemned prison
when he took office nearly six years ago, saying it was damaging
America's image around the world.

But he has been unable to do
so, partly because of obstacles posed by the U.S. Congress.

President Obama on Sunday said he is going to keep trying to shut down the U.S. military prison at Guantanamo Bay, even as he's failed to do so six years after taking office and making the same promise

'I'm going to be doing everything I can to close it,' Obama
said on CNN's 'State of the Union with Candy Crowley' in an interview taped on Friday.

'It is something that continues to inspire jihadists and
extremists around the world, the fact that these folks are being
held,' he said.

'It is contrary to our values and it is wildly expensive.
We're spending millions for each individual there. And we have
drawn down the population there significantly,' he added.

In the latest step in the gradual push to close the prison,
four Afghans held for over a decade at Guantanamo have been sent
home, the Pentagon said on Saturday.

The men were flown to Kabul overnight aboard a U.S. military plane and released to Afghan authorities, the first such transfer of its kind to the war-torn country since 2009, according to a U.S. official. 

With a recent trickle of releases, including the transfer of six prisoners to Uruguay earlier this month, Guantanamo's detainee population has been gradually whittled down to 132.

The repatriation of the four Afghans, identified as 'low-level detainees' who were cleared for transfer long ago and are not considered security risks in their homeland, had been in the pipeline for months.

But in a measure of what one senior U.S. official described as an improving relationship with the new Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, Washington went ahead with the transfer after he formally requested it.

Guantanamo was opened by Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, to house terrorism suspects rounded up overseas, with Afghans originally the largest group.

Most of the detainees have been held for a decade or more without being charged or tried.

Thirteen other prisoners of various nationalities have been transferred from Guantanamo since early November, and several more could be repatriated or sent to countries other than their homelands by year-end, U.S. officials said.

Just two weeks ago, the U.S. Senate said in a bombshell new report that torture of Al-Qaeda suspects — most instances at Guantanamo — was far more brutal than acknowledged and failed to produce useful intelligence.

Among the findings: a CIA operative used 'Russian Roulette' to intimidate a prisoner and another — untrained in interrogation techniques —  threatened to use a power drill. 

Detainees were humiliated through the painful use of medically unnecessary 'rectal feeding' and 'rectal rehydration.'

One died of hypothermia while shackled, while some suffered broken limbs.

The report said the Central Intelligence Agency also misled the White House and Congress with inaccurate claims about the program's usefulness in thwarting attacks, the Senate Intelligence Committee said in its graphic report that revived the debate over interrogation techniques such as waterboarding.

President Obama said then that torture had been counterproductive and contrary to American values. 

CIA director John Brennan defended his agency's adoption of tough tactics under president George W. Bush in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, Al-Qaeda attacks on US cities.

He insisted that, while mistakes were made, brutal techniques 'did produce intelligence that helped thwart attack plans, capture terrorists and save lives.'

Obama still faces major obstacles in trying to shut down the prison, among the biggest being the Yemeni detainees who make up more than half the remaining inmate population.

Most have been cleared for transfer but are unable to return home because of the chaotic security situation in the Arabian Peninsula state.

Two weeks ago a U.S. Senate report delivered a scathing indictment of the harsh Bush-era interrogation program used on terrorism suspects.

Obama banned the techniques when he took office in 2009.
