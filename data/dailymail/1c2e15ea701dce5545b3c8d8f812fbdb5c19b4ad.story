She's famous for her love of sport and her ability to turn her hand to anything from polo to wheelchair rugby, or murderball as it's also known.

Now Zara Phillips has revealed that she knows knows more than a little about cooking, after turning out to judge a picnic competition.

In an exclusive video seen by MailOnline, the relaxed royal jokes with well-wishers and BBC presenter Matt Baker, before issuing the rallying cry: 'So who's got the best picnic?'

Deliberations: Zara and fellow judge BBC presenter Matt Barker attempt to work out whose picnic is best

Impressed: Zara appeared most impressed with one entrant's fully stocked mobile bar

Lovely: Along with a choice of whisky and some  Gordon's Gin, the bar also contained lots of champagne

But while the food found favour with the 33-year-old, she seemed most impressed with the fully-stocked bar set up by one picnicker in the back of his Land Rover.

'Look at the bar!' she exclaims before turning her attention to the mobile bar's owner, who is busy with a barbecue. 'Do you do a lot of picnic barbecuing?' she asks.

'No and my wife has asked me not to burn the grass,' the man replies. Joking, the royal then responds: 'Well at least he did as he's told'.

Despite the man's impressive bar and barbecuing skills, eventing fans Lucy Sharpley and Harry Horrell were named the winners and presented with first prize, a bottle of Pol Roger champagne.

Zara, who was invited to judge the picnic competition by Land Rover, has had a busy month courtesy of a tough competition schedule and several public appearances.

Most recently, she joined her cousin Prince Harry at the invictus Games for a spot of wheelchair rugby, which saw her battle it out alongside her royal relation against a team that included husband Mike Tindall.

Despite spending most of the match attempting to bash him with her wheelchair, the final whistle saw Zara scoot over to plant a kiss on her husband.

When not turning out in support of wounded servicemen and women, Zara has been concentrating on her eventing career.

A regular at courses over the summer, her efforts culminated in a successful result at the World Equestrian Games in Normandy in front of Team GB selectors preparing to pick the eventing squad for Rio 2016.

Zara, who was part of the London 2012 Olympic team, already has an Olympic silver to her name, following a stellar performance during the competition.
