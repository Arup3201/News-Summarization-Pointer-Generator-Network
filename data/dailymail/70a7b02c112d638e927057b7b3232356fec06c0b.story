A 24-year-old nursing student charged with planning a terror attack on a Sydney police station had once tried to join the Australian army out of love for the country.

However, Omar Al-Kutobi's father Ahmad told Fairfax that his son's application was rejected two years ago, adding that only six months ago the Iraqi born refugee admitted he was frustrated with the nation he called home.

'He told me "life in Australia is so hard". I told him, "You don't remember when you said Australia is the best country in the world?",' Ahmad recalled from his home in Germany.

'Yes, but it is changing,' he said was his son's response.

Omar Al-Kutobi's father has revealed that he spoke to his son, who was lonely in Australia, just hours before he was arrestedand charged with plotting an 'imminent' terror attack on Sydney

Al-Kutobi and his housemate Mohammad Kiad, 25, appeared in court on Thursday two days after they were arrested at their granny flat home in Fairfield, where police allegedly found a machete, a hunting knife, and a video in which they appeared in front of an Islamic State flag and one of them made violent threats.

They were detained just after Al-Kutobi bought a hunting knife from military and camping supplies store and only hours before their alleged plan to attack police officers was due to take place, according to Channel Nine.

Neither were on security watch-lists and both entered Australia as refugees.

Fairfax has reported that Al-Kutobi entered the country on a false passport in 2009 before being granted an Australian citizenship in 2013.

Kiad, whose Facebook page states that he has been married since 2010, received a family and spousal visa in 2012 after leaving Kuwait, shortly before separating from his wife.

'If they had managed to hurt someone I would have felt guilty for the rest of my life, because I brought this man to Australia,' his wife, who preferred to remain anonymous, told Channel 10.

It comes after Ahmad revealed his son had grown lonely in Australia and said that he'd spoken to him just hours before his arrest.

'He told me he [was] working as a truck driver and asked me about his mother. That is all. Everything was OK,' Ahmad, told Fairfax.

He said his son was struggling to find a balance between his work as a removalist and his studies and revealed that he had begun a nursing degree after struggling to find work in IT.

Mohammad Kiad, 25, and Omar al-Kutobi, 24, lived together in this granny flat in Sydney's west 

During police raids at the property on Tuesday it's alleged a machete, a hunting knife, and a video featuring one of the men making threats were found

'He told [me] many times to come to him because he is alone,' Ahmad said. 

The men's neighbours  said Al-Kutobi and Kaid had begun acting differently after the anti-terror raids in western Sydney last September

'He [Al-Kutobi] began wearing a scarf, just like ISIS and Mohammad, he grew a long beard,' neighbour Michael David said.

'I heard them praying in there [the granny flat] and reading the Koran,' said Mr David, who speaks Arabic.

A neighbour said both men rarely cooked - sometimes a barbecue - and ordered in pizza or Chinese and went out to meet friends or go to the mosque

Kiad has reportedly lived in the flat for a year and al-Kutobi for up to three years

Police will allege the men were plotting to carry out an attack on Tuesday and had armed themselves with a machete and a hunting knife and made a video detailing their plans.

An image of the pair smoking shisha together - obtained from 25-year-old Kiad's Facebook page - was uploaded in July, 2013.  

Neighbour Deresita Heisele-Brown said Omar al-utobi was friendlier than Mohammed Kiad who was 'shy' but both young men had become more withdrawn over the last month.

She said the boys rarely cooked - sometimes a barbecue - and ordered in pizza or Chinese and went out to meet friends or go to the mosque.

'They wore western clothes but sometimes head wear and Mohammed wears long white tunic, maybe for the mosque.'

She said both men went to Centrelink but were often short of money and couldn't pay rent to the owner of the house, Mr Huynh, who has a large property with a granny flat in which the two men lived, Kiad for a year and al-Kutobi for up to three years.

Kiad  worked as a nurse in Kuwait but could not transfer his skills to Australia and both men had worked as furniture removalists.

Moldy Lebanese bread, boxes of energy cereal, an unused sink full of plastic-ware and barbecue trays and utensils were found inside the home.

Inside the squat two bedroom granny flat which the two alleged terrorists tented from their Vietnamese landlord, there are scenes which could depict the squalor of any twenty something bachelors.

A picnic table sits out the back by the rubbish bins.

A song book is propped on the sink near a toolbox on top of the unnused stove.

A box of Arabic green tea has been torn open in the kitchen.

An Islamic calendar still hangs on the wall in a back room by a pulled out drawer full of wires and leads. 

Neighbour Deresita Heisele-Brown said Mohammed Kiad was 'shy' but had become more withdrawn lately

A home-made flag, representing the prescribed terrorist organisation Islamic State, was found at the flat, police said

Ms Jeisele-Brown said the pair had fallen out with another neighbour over the last month or two for 'speaking sharp' and that she had been upset with them after finding a religious picture of hers dumped in the rubbish bin.

'I had been in hospital having chemotherapy and when I came back home my picture of Jesus Christ was missing,' she said.

'I found it in the rubbish. I don't know who dumped it but I thought... I didn't say anything.'

Ms Heisele-Brown said Omar Al-Kutobi had been talking about going to Germany where his mother lived and had been waiting for his mother to send him money.

'He had no family here, but he said he could never go back to Iraq.'

She said she had noticed that after the Martin Place siege, the two men had had lengthy discussions in Arabic and had watched a lot of television, perhaps coverage of the a siege.

She said when the police came around to arrest the pair, Mohammad had pretended he didn't speak English.

She said detectives had made the men lie on the ground while they handcuffed them. 

NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn and Australian Federal Police Deputy Commissioner Michael Phelan said two men have been arrested on terrorism charges 

The defendants, who were housemates at the time of their arrest, have asked for an Arabic interpreter. 

NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Catherine Burn said in a press conference on Wednesday two men, aged 24 and 25, have been charged with 'acts done in preparation, for, or planning terrorist acts'.

'We will be alleging that the two men were well advanced in their preparations,' Ms Burn said.

It will be alleged that the two were going to undertake an act of terrorism in Australia as revenge for incidents overseas. 

Searches were conducted at their residence, as well as on a car, and where the men work.

'We will allege both of these men were preparing to do this attack yesterday... it was imminent and we acted,' Ms Burns said.    

'The type of act is consistent with the messaging coming out of IS but we are of the view that there is no further imminent attacks planned.'

AFP Deputy Commissioner, Michael Phelan, said the raids and arrests were an example of how authorities are having to be 'nimble to adjust to the threat'.

'We acted as soon as we possibly could,' he said.

The raids, titled Operation 'CASTRUM', were led by NSW Police Force's Joint Counter Terrorism Team.
