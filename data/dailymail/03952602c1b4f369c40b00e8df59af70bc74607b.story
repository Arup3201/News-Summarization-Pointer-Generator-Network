West Auckland will forever be remembered as the village team from the North East who won the first World Cup.

It was also the home of Britain’s first female serial killer, Mary Ann Cotton.

When you drive in and out of the former County Durham colliery you are reminded of the World Cup victories of 1909 and 1911.

History: The Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy, the first 'World Cup' on display at West Auckland

There are no such plaques commemorating the 19th century poisoning spree of Cotton, who claimed 21 victims and was hanged in 1873.

On Saturday, West Auckland Town’s current crop of footballers – none of whom are coalminers, unlike the men who were two-time world champions – have the chance to write a new chapter in the village’s history when they venture to Wembley for the FA Vase final against Sholing of Hampshire. The history books could certainly do with a modern-day instalment.

For it is the Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy triumphs of over one century ago which remain the subject of bar-room banter at the West Auckland Working Men’s Club.

Indeed, an exact replica of the cup is housed there, the original having been stolen in 1994 and never recovered.

‘The village is football, that’s what it’s all about and what it lives for,’ current West Auckland boss Peter Dixon told Sportsmail.

There are five famous former residents; four were footballers and the other, infamously of course, was Cotton.

One of those footballers, Tom Alderson, was born in the village in 1909, the same year West Auckland returned from Italy with their first ‘World’ crown (it was referred to as such because this was the first time clubs from different countries had competed against each other in a tournament).

Alderson, incidentally, went on to play for his local side before making his name at Leeds United, Luton Town, Darlington and Chester City.

By the time he was two years old, West Auckland were heading back to Turin to defend their title.

There they beat FC Zurich of Switzerland 2-0 in the semi-final before humbling Italian giants Juventus 6-1 in the final. It wasn’t until they returned that the village folk were regaled with tales of their triumph.

One hundred years on, the club were invited back to Turin where they faced a Juventus under-20 side, who served their belated revenge courtesy of a 7-1 victory.

Mystery, though, still surrounds the nature of their original invite to the competition in 1909, as Dixon explains: ‘They still talk about it now. One theory is that Woolwich Arsenal were invited but an admin error meant West Auckland, with the same initials, went instead.

‘Either way, the association with those World Cup victories certainly adds a little bit of prestige to the club.

‘Everyone in the village still talks about it and I’m reminded of it every day when I drive in and out.

‘And that’s brilliant, it should be celebrated, but we want to write our own bit of history now.’

West Auckland were beaten FA Vase finalists two years ago when Northern League rivals Dunston UTS returned to the region victorious.

And Dixon – in charge since 2009 - reflected: ‘Wembley is an unbelievable stadium and a fantastic occasion and an incredible achievement just to get there.

‘But when you lose – as we did two years ago – everything is amplified. It’s never nice to lose any football match, but do it at Wembley means the heartache is ten times as bad.’

The 45-year-old went on: ‘I think the last time we went there we treated it a bit like a theme park.

‘I’m trying now to get the lads focused on the game, it’s a 90-minute match and that is their priority – not the stadium or anything else which goes with the day, that will come later.

‘To be honest, I’m terrified of losing but all I want the lads to do is turn up – we didn’t two years ago – and give it our best shot. I’ll take that.’

It is 51 years since West Auckland last lifted the Northern League Cup and the Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy win remains their last success outside of regional competition.

Dixon knows what victory this weekend would mean.

‘There were over 100 people waving us off on Friday morning, and everyone else will be coming to the game,’ he added.

‘As I said, West Auckland is a football village, that’s what it is. The lads tell me there was a serial killer as well, but that’s it.

‘So there has been no history made in over 100 years and we’ve got the chance to change that.

‘We’ve had success since myself and my assistant Paul Foster took over, but we haven’t won anything.

‘We’re desperate now to bring back some silverware for the village, I’m sure the welcome party would be something special.’

They’ve waited more than 100 years to throw such a celebration. It is time to forget those World Cup heroes, if only for one night.

Tickets for the 2014 FA Vase Final are available on the day at Wembley Stadium, priced £15 for adults and £5 for under 16s.
