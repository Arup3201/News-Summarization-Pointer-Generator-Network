The cars were gleaming in the sunshine as participants of this year’s Cannonball 2000 gathered in London for the annual European tour.

Lined up outside the swanky Hilton Hotel on Park Lane the 50 participants had their engines roaring and ready to go on the five-day long journey.

The 2,000 mile tour takes the drivers through five European cities.

Ex-boxer Ricky Hatton will be taking part in the race alongside Coronation Street actor Ryan Thomas and Emmerdale star Kevin Fletcher.

The trio looked very pleased with themselves surrounded by glammed-up girls ahead of the race.

Other contestants tried to out-do each other with crazy costumes and decked out super-motors.

Comics seemed to be a popular theme with drivers dressed up as Spidermen and others as Barney and Fred from The Flintstones.

The tour is named after the famous 1981 film Cannonball Run about a cross country race, starring Burt Reynolds and Roger Moore.

Cannonball 2000 sees the participants 
drive from London to Barcelona and make their way through Monte Carlo 
and Milan before crossing the finish line on Paris’ Champs Elysees on 
Sunday.

Long-distance race events, such as Cannonball, have received criticism after a driver in a rival 
event, Gumball 3000 Rally, was involved in a crash which killed an 
elderly Macedonian couple in 2007.

Wealthy businessman Nicholas Morley was spared jail for his involvement 
in the accident which saw his Porsche 911 crash into Vladimir 
Chepunjoski, 67, and his wife Margarita’s Volkswagen Golf near the 
Albanian border in May five years ago.

Based on the same principle as Cannonball 2000, each competitor pays 
£28,000 to enter Gumball 3000 which involves driving 3,000 miles from 
London to Athens and back, across Europe on public roads.

Mr Morley was given a two-year-suspended sentence but the case raised 
questions about the safety risks of asking participants to drive long 
distances, sometimes 720 miles, in one day.

Gumball 3000 regularly attracts celebrities such as supermodel Jodie Kidd, DJ David Guetta and David Hasselhoff.

Cannonball 2000 Founder Gary Redman describes the cross-continent drive as a ‘pulsating five-day party with like minded people looking to enjoy some of the most amazing cities in the world'.

The event sponsors children’s charity Dreams come True and donates a percentage of their proceeds to the charity which helps fulfill the wishes of terminally ill children.
