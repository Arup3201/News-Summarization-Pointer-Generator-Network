Oscar Pistorius was reportedly messaging glamour model Katie Price during his trial for the culpable homicide of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp.

Price wrote in her Now magazine column in March that she was 'not going to judge Oscar on other people's theories portrayed via the media' and that 'we are all equal when it comes to judicial undertakings'.

A month later, Pistorius started following Price on Twitter and messaging her, report the Daily Mirror.

'He was direct messaging me during the case. It’s weird, isn’t it? He was saying, "Thanks for the support," and stuff. Just all general chit-chat,' Price told the paper's 3am column.

'Because I mentioned him in my column, he was referencing that. I wasn’t exactly supporting him, but everyone who goes through a trial will be the only one who knows what really happened.'

Price, who was alerted to the messages by her brother, said she would love to interview the South African, who was sentenced to five years in jail last week after he shot Steenkamp through a toilet door at his home on Valentine's Day last year.

Under the current terms, the double-amputee is eligible for release after 10 months and would then complete his sentence under house arrest. 

South African prosecutors last week confirmed they will appeal against Pistorius's manslaughter verdict and five-year prison sentence after failing to secure a murder conviction. 

MailOnline has contacted a spokesperson for the star following these reports.
