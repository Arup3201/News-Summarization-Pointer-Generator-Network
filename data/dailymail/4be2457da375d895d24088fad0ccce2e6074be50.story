As U.S. security chiefs warn of a possible terror plot using explosives hidden in tubes of toothpaste during the Olympic Games, liquids have been banned from carry-on luggage.

The ban on liquids, gels, aerosols and powders in hand luggage will apply to all non-stop flights from the U.S. to Russia, where the 2014 Winter Games is being held.

A warning from Homeland Security had said terror groups might try to assemble explosive devices during flights or on arrival at the Olympics.

Ban: Passengers taking direct flights to Russia will not be allowed to carry liquids in their hand luggage

Delta Airlines, the only American airline that has regularly scheduled nonstop flights to Russia, posted a warning about the Transportation Security Administration policy on Thursday.

As well as the restrictions on items in hand luggage, Delta has advised that all customers flying to Russia will need to check in personally with one of its representatives, rather than using its online or mobile kiosks.

The warning was made public on the eve of the Winter Games in Sochi, although Homeland Security said the government was not aware of a threat to the U.S.

The Russian government has tried to allay fears of a potential terror attack.

Dmitry Kozak, a Russian deputy prime minister, told Fox News: 'We can guarantee the safety of the people as well as any other government hosting a mass event.'

'There is no reason to believe Sochi, in Russia, is under more threat than any other city in the world,' he added.
