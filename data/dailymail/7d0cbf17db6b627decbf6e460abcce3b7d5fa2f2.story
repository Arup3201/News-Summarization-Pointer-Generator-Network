After coming in for criticism for his stuffy holiday outfits in the past, it certainly is a step in the right direction.

But David Cameron still can’t quite pull off the effortlessly casual look, it seems.

Last year, the Prime Minister was ridiculed by fashion watchers for wearing dark cotton trousers and smart black work shoes during a family break to Majorca.

The Prime Minister - who has been criticised in the past for his choice of holiday wear - today wore pair of loafers (worn without socks) for the visit

Yesterday on his summer holiday to Portugal, he at least sported more appropriate footwear for a visit to a fish market with wife Samantha – if not the most stylish.

The beige loafers, worn without socks, cost £20.99 from bargain shoe shop Aldo.

The Prime Minister has also been the butt of jokes for wearing the same blue polo shirt year after year.

He has swapped that for a new button-down model – again in blue – costing £19.90 from Uniqlo, which he teamed with a pair of shorts that were also £19.90 from Uniqlo.

While he appeared slightly awkward with his new style, Mrs Cameron looked elegant in a £49.99 sleeveless green dress from Zara, and high-heeled sandals, thought to have cost £60 from Aldo.

The couple bought fresh squid from the market at Aljezur on the Algarve, where they are staying with children Nancy, nine, Arthur, seven, and Florence, two.

They arrived in Faro on an EasyJet flight yesterday morning for their two-week break.

Mr Cameron’s recent efforts to look trendily casual saw him team jeans with a pair of open-toed, flip-flop style leather sandals during a short break to Ibiza earlier this year.

And last month he was spotted sauntering barefoot at a music festival wearing a £1.99 pair of fake Ray-Ban sunglasses.

Mr Cameron and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg are again facing criticism over the timings of their holidays after it emerged they would be abroad at the same time for the second year in a row.

The Liberal Democrat leader and family are visiting their summer home in Olmedo, Spain.

The Camerons are also due to make their annual trip to Cornwall and holiday in Scotland during Westminster’s long break.

Downing Street aides stressed that Mr Cameron is still in charge wherever he is in the world.

In 2011, David Cameron and Samantha were pictured sat at a cafe in Montevarchi near Siena, Italy, and the PM was opted for what looked like pair of black work loafers without socks
