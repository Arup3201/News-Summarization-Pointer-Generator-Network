An elderly couple baffled by a mystery mewling sound at their bungalow discovered they were sharing their home with some unexpected guests.

Firefighters tore up floors and broke open walls to try and locate the source of the sound at Sue and Brian Davie's Essex home after the couple called the RSPCA - and eventually discovered four newborn kittens trapped beneath floorboards.

It is thought a stray cat gave birth to a litter in the Davies' loft, and that the tiny kittens slipped one by one through a hole into the cavity wall before getting stuck under the floor.

All four kittens were retrieved safe and well after the exhaustive search of the property in Frinton-on-Sea by firefighters, who used specialist listening equipment and a snake-eye camera to help find the litter.

Mrs Davie said: 'I wouldn’t have minded if they’d had to take the whole floor up to get them out.

'They were tiny - their eyes and ears were still closed they were so young.

'It’s amazing they were all okay. The fire service was so good - they all did such a great job,' she added.

Find: Rescue workers discovered a one-week-old kitten trapped beneath floorboards in a boiler cupboard (left), before retrieving three more of the tiny creatures from underneath the living room floorboards (right)

Two of the rescue workers were so enamoured by the fluffy creatures they are each planning to give one a home.

Mr and Mrs Davie, who don't own a cat, called the RSPCA on 
Saturday to investigate the mysterious 
miaowing sound emerging from a cavity wall.

Firefighters called in to assist began tearing the bungalow apart in a bid to locate the kittens,

They found one kitten after removing floorboards by a boiler cupboard - but could still hear miaowing elsewhere.

They
eventually tracked down the noise to a corner of the living room, and 
removed three more kittens from beneath the floorboards.

Reunited: The kittens have been reunited with their mother, who is thought to have had the litter in the Davies' loft

Search operation: The couple called the RSPCA after hearing the strange sound at their home in Frinton-on-Sea on Saturday

Firefighter Paul Nash said: 'A stray cat had got into the loft of the bungalow and had a litter.

'The
kittens had somehow managed to drop down one by one from a hole in the 
loft and gone into the cavity wall and then got underneath the 
floorboards,' Mr Nash said.

The kittens were re-united with their mother and are now being cared for by the RSPCA.
