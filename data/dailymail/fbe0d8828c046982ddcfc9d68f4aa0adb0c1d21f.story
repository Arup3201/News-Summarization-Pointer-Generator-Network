Yesterday, he revealed that he needed to put Christmas bells in Prince George's pocket in a bid to keep up with him.

Today, the Duke of Cambridge was back on the hunt for parenting tips as he made a series of investitures at Buckingham Palace, actor Daniel Day-Lewis among them.

Mr Day-Lewis, 57, was knighted by Prince William during the ceremony in recognition of the triple Oscar winner's services to acting.

Arise Sir Daniel! The Duke of Cambridge knights actor Daniel Day-Lewis, 57, at Buckingham Palace

Congratulations: A cheerful Prince William chats to Mr - now Sir - Day-Lewis after the knighting

During his 30-year career, the Anglo-Irish actor has starred in 25 films, as well as scores of TV shows and has won plaudits for his method acting.

His stellar career was not, however, enough to prepare him for news of his knighthood, with Mr - now Sir - Day-Lewis receiving it with the words: 'I'm entirely amazed and utterly delighted in equal measure.'

Famously choosy about the roles he takes, Sir Day-Lewis has starred in just five films since 1998, most notably 2012's Lincoln - a biopic of American President Abraham Lincoln - for which he scooped his third Oscar, as well as a BAFTA, his fourth. 

Others to be recognised for their hard work were Christine and Harry Burditt from Sheffield, who, over 30 years, have fostered 40 children.

Winner: Sir Day-Lewis has won three Oscars, most recently for his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln

Early years: Sir Day-Lewis' career began in the early 80s and includes 1989's My Left Foot

Proud: Linda Garbett is made a CBE while Harriet Devlin, also from Shrewsbury, gets an MBE

Pleased: Kathleen Mainland, from Edinburgh, was made a CBE by the Duke of Cambridge

It was to them that the Duke addressed his queries as he presented both with MBEs as a reward for their dedication.

As well as continuing to care for vulnerable youngsters needing a short-term home, the couple, both 72, also have six children, 10 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.

After receiving his medal from the Duke, Mr Burditt said: 'He was very interested. He said ‘I need to speak to you, because I need some tips for looking after George!"'

Mrs Burditt, who has been fostering for 34 years, said it was 'overwhelming' to be honoured for services to children and families, and they hoped they could still 'be useful' to those who need their help.

She added: 'It is a house full of kids, put it that way. I don’t like it without children.

'It’s lovely to receive this award on behalf of Sheffield foster carers - they are such a marvellous set of people up there.'

Honour: Jonathan Ullmer from Westcliff-On-Sea got an MBE while London's Julian Metcalfe got an OBE
