Life sentence: Paul Taylor murdered 22-year-old Sally McGrath over 30 years ago and buried her in a shallow grave

A violent and predatory rapist who avoided justice for more than three decades after brutally murdering a 22-year-old woman has today been jailed for life.

Fish and chip shop owner Paul Taylor, now 60, killed former supermarket worker Sally McGrath and buried her naked body in a shallow grave in Cambridgeshire woodland in July 1979.

Her remains were eventually discovered in 1980, but the mystery of her death would remain unsolved for the next 32 years.

Taylor was finally brought to justice after a cold case review was launched in 2009 and detectives decided to re-interview the former soldier, who had been a suspect in the initial investigation.

Chelmsford Crown Court was told the killer, who was also convicted of a string of sex attacks on other women during the late 1970s, will serve a minimum term of 18 years for Miss McGrath's murder.

Detectives are now exploring the possibility that Taylor was responsible for other sex attacks, and are focusing on the Hampshire region where he lived in recent years.

A judge said today: 'I think it is clear there was a sexual element to the murder of Sally McGrath.

'The evidence revealed a pattern of behaviour in which you lured your victims in under the pretence of giving them a lift home,' said Mr Justice Owen.

'You then drove them to a rural or isolated area and forced yourself upon them.

'Your predatory sexual attacks took place over 30 years ago but your victims have been left scarred for life.

'I have no doubt the brutal murder of Sally McGrath followed the same pattern and resulted from her resistance to your sexual demands.'

Taylor had shown no emotion as the 
jury of eight men and four women unanimously found him guilty of murder 
after deliberating for nearly 23 hours.

The former solider, from Fareham, 
Hampshire, was also found guilty of three counts of rape, one count of 
attempted rape and another serious sexual assault relating to three 
other women.

Taylor, who was 27 at the time of the murder, was described as a reasonably good-looking and strong man who had a reputation as a womaniser despite being married.

In March 1979 he repeatedly raped a 19-year-old after offering her a lift home from the Bull Hotel in Peterborough.

A month later Taylor attacked a 24-year-old girl after offering her a lift home from a Christening party near the town.

The jury heard that as he drove her back he pulled into a layby and grabbed her by the back of the neck saying: 'You know you want it.'

When she resisted Taylor punched her in the face then pushed her from his vehicle and drove off, the court heard.

Just two weeks before the disappearance of Sally McGrath the murderer, who was then working as a builder, convinced a 17-year-old girl to join him and a teenage apprentice on a boat ride.

But once she got into the van he drove her to a stretch of woodland just 600 yards from where he would later bury Miss McGrath and violently raped the teenager, telling his workmate to 'come back in half an hour'.

When the apprentice returned, Taylor was said to be 'back to his charming self' and even offered to buy the pair an ice cream.

A fortnight after the rape, on the morning of July 11 1979, Sally McGrath said goodbye to her mother as she left her parents' house. It was the last time the 22-year-old was seen alive.

Taylor had been subject to bail conditions for a burglary but had failed to report to a police station as instructed at 6pm on the night of Miss McGrath’s disappearance, the court heard.

Ahead of the verdict Mr Khalil QC, prosecuting, had described the murder of Miss McGrath as 'the culmination of the defendant’s predatory traits' following a number of violent sexual assaults on young woman.

He had urged jurors at the culmination of Taylor's eight week trial: 'You may well wonder why these offences were not prosecuted, or prosecuted more vigorously, closer to the time but it is your task to ensure justice is done now.

'This man has escaped justice for too long.'
