While Jose Mourinho insists Barclays Premier League referees are conspiring against him, the Chelsea manager has only himself to blame for not being seven points ahead of Manchester City.

Frank Lampard was allowed to leave Stamford Bridge in June, when the 36-year-old signed for New York City before moving on loan to the Major League Soccer outfit's sister club in Manchester.

The former England midfielder has won last season's Premier League champions seven points this campaign, his latest two coming after turning a draw into a win against Sunderland on New Year's Day.

176 goals

138 with right foot

22 with left foot

16 with head

43 penalties

147 for Chelsea

5 for Manchester City 

4th highest scorer ever  

That earned City two points and was reward following 48 hours of negotiations  to extend Lampard's deal at the Etihad.

Another two came away against Leicester City on December 13 when, without Lampard's winner in the 40th minute, they would have been held to a 0-0 draw at the King Power Stadium.

But his first and most significant contribution to Manuel Pellegrini came on September 21 when Chelsea were in town, winning 1-0 against 10 men after Pablo Zabaleta was sent off.

Lampard's equaliser in the 85th minute not only rescued City one point, but dropped two for Chelsea in the process, making his total seven so far.

Mourinho and Pellegrini are level, sharing 46 points and a plus-25 goal difference, but Chelsea could be the happier in 2015 had Lampard not been wearing a lighter shade of blue.

Lampard's latest strike was his 176th, too, making him the fourth highest Premier League goalscorer of all time ahead of Thierry Henry on 175. He chases Manchester United's Wayne Rooney on 181 and is 11 off second-placed Andy Cole.

He will probably not overtake Alan Shearer on 260 goals. 

Given the accuracy and power of his winner against Sunderland, it is perhaps surprising that was just Lampard's 16th Premier League goal with his head, having always favoured his right foot (138).

Meanwhile in London, Mourinho has continued his conspiracy theory that there is some sort of campaign against Chelsea.

His latest claim came after referee Phil Dowd did not award them a penalty in the 5-3 loss against Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane.

So, if the Special One misses out on the Premier League title come May by such a slender margin, he will rue giving City the opportunity to use their own weapon against them.
