The cloth looks silky smooth to the touch and the apple looks ripe for eating. But taking a bite of these ones would leave you with a mouth full of splinters.

These are the creation of art professor Tom Eckert, who carves, turns, bends and laminates wood to looks like fabrics, glass, stone and fruit.

After applying waterborne lacquer paint with spray guns and brushes, the results are hyper-realistic, if a touch surreal.

Ripe to the touch, or so it seems. These apples are some of art professor Tom Eckert's wooden creations

It's not just the cards that play tricks: the silky fabric is a highly-finished piece of wood

Paper, plastic and fabric are all part of the mirage in Professor Eckert's work

A realistic-looking pebble, complete with chipped marks, appears to float in this carved bowl

It's not just still life that captures Professor Eckert's imagination: here it looks like a gun barrel concealed under silk, while a snake wraps itself around the leg of a stool

Professor Eckert, who teaches at Arizona State University, said: 'The woods I prefer working with are basswood, linden and limewood because they carve and paint well and are very stable.

'Coming from a painting and drawing background, I am still interested in applying some of those techniques to my sculptures.'

The professor's curiosity for realism was piqued by a childhood car trip.

'One of my earliest recollections, on
a car trip, was my perception of the wet, slick highway ahead that 
turned out to be an illusion, a mirage,' he said.

Lemons, goblets, jugs and a kettle form this still life portait

One of Professor Eckert's early wooden works was this Bomb Clock

The intricate carving of the bomb wires and other sculptures requires an array of tools and techniques

Professor Eckert sprays and brushes waterborne lacquer paint onto his works

The cork isn't the only piece of wood in this bottle of wine, sat atop a tall table

Polished cutlery awaits on this side table, but all the objects are wood carvings

Floating pebbles appear to have cloth slithering over them but these are one carving

'By tradition, cloth has been widely used to conceal and shroud objects in practices ranging from advertising to church rituals.

'Covered forms are often more evocative - with a sense of mystery absent from the uncovered object by itself.

'I remember in church one Lent, as a child, being mystified while gazing at the statues shrouded with purple cloth.

'This visual deception is now the basis for my creative direction.Â 

'When
this idea is applied to my compositions (floating book, floating cards,
floating rock) a sense of the impossible happens - for me, magic.'

This wooden window scene is almost a glance into the outside world

The professor says he likes the 'sense of mystery' concealed objects give

Professor Eckert prefers to use basswood, linden and limewood for his pieces

He favours the materials because they carve easily and hold paint well

Crockery looks to be balancing precariously in this piece by Tom Eckert

You wouldn't want to rub your face on this towel, whittled from wood

Professor Eckert's fascination with hyper-realistic art was sparked in his childhood and now it's his career

The wood was fashioned into this branch seemingly floating above a block of granite for this sculpture

The careful precision of Professor Eckert makes the wooden fabric look wrinkled

It takes painstaking attention and care to make wood look like hanging fabric

Here the wood is transformed into a patent high heeled shoe atop a silky garment

Professor Eckert says that the sense of visual deception is 'magic'

The wood requires close attention and careful whittling in the professor's workshop

The life-size sculptures are created with the aid of Professor Eckert's students
