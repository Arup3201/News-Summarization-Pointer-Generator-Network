Madonna appeared to make a public apology to France's far-right nationalist leader Marine Le Pen last night after depicting the politician with a swastika across her forehead.

It comes as the leader of the National Front prepares to sue the pop queen for associating her with Adolf Hitler's Nazis.

In an eccentric performance in front of 2,500 fans in Paris, Madonna said: 'I know that I have made a certain Marine Le Pen very angry with me. It's not my intention to make enemies.'

Madonna then went on to praise France for its tolerance and the welcome it had shown to black performers.

She said: 'Before the civil rights movement in America, African American artists were not allowed to perform in America, but France opened its arms to Josephine Baker, Charlie Parker, to people of colour and people who were different. Minorities felt welcome in France.

'If we don't learn from history we will just repeat it. So the next time you want to point the finger at somebody and blame them for the problems in your life take that finger and point it back at you.'

Despite her emotive words, there were boos when Madonna, who turns 54 in August, performed for just 45 minutes, after fans paid up to £200 to see her.

Music to their ears: The 54-year-old announced that she 'did not want to make enemies' with a 'very angry' Marine Le Pen, right, and praised France for its tolerance and welcome it has shown to black performers

She also raised eyebrows when she said: 'I have a special affinity with France, and I have for many years. It could go all the way to Napoleon because I think of myself as a revolutionary.'

The pop queen was attacked for only singing for around 30 minutes - and spending 15 minutes 'wittering on about politics'.

As she left the stage, the curtains closed behind her with a message reading 'I love you'.

But when she did not reappear for an encore, audience members began jeering, booing and pelting the stage with bottles.

Ticket prices for the sold-out gig started at £60 rising to £200, but were exchanging hands on the black market for up to £1,000.

Concert-goer Guillaume Delaval said afterwards: 'The show was OK but it only last 45 minutes, and she spent 15 minutes of that wittering on about politics and tolerance.

'We didn't come to hear that. It was a concert, not the United Nations.'

Madonna's staff were not available for comment today on why she ended the gig so abruptly.

The National Front has already lodged
 a formal legal complaint on Madonna for the Nazi stunt, which she 
pulled at another concert in Paris earlier this month.

Florian
 Philippot, the FN's vice-president, said the party could not accept 
'such an odious comparison', adding: 'This is just another provocation 
in Madonna's world tour so that people will talk about her.

'Marine Le Pen will defend not only her own honour but her supporters and the millions of National Front voters.'

Ms
 Le Pen, 43, threatened prosecution when Madonna performed the same 
stunt in Israel, saying: 'We understand how old singers who need to get 
people talking about them go to such extremes.'

Other sources in the National Front, which has frequently been linked with anti-Semitism and racism, said Madonna had offended all of its members.

'We are not a Nazi party, and object to being depicted as such,' said a source in the party, which won a fifth of the popular vote during the first round of presidential elections in April.

'If you accuse the National Front of being anti-Semitic and racist then you accuse a fifth of the French people of being anti-Semitic and racist.'

Marine Le Pen pledged to reform the party after taking over the leadership from her notorious father, Jean-Marie Le Pen last year.

He is a convicted racist and anti-Semite who has in the past denied that the Nazi Holocaust actually took place during World War II.

Despite this, he came runner-up in the French presidential election in 2002, proving that he had widespread support.

Ms Le Pen has toned down the party's extremist views, but regularly pledges to limit Muslim immigration, and to clamp down on Islamic culture in France.

Madonna is well known for her provocative acts, and is currently dating a Frenchman called Brahim Zaibat who has a North African Muslim immigrant background.

Ms Le Pen won just under 18 per cent of votes in the presidential election but failed in her bid to become an MP in France's National Assembly.
