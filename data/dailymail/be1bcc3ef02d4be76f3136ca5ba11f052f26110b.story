Liverpool are on the brink of making Alberto Moreno their eighth summer signing after he was pulled out of Sevilla's squad for the European Super Cup final.

Moreno has been Liverpool's No 1 target to come in at left-back all summer and, after protracted negotiations, they have finally struck a £12million deal with the Europa League winners - which they revealed on their website late on Tuesday night.

The defender could be seen in tears after Sevilla's 2-0 defeat by Real Madrid in the European showpiece on Tuesday night in public hint that he is on his way. 

Moreno was consoled by team-mates as he led a tearful goodbye to those Sevilla fans who travelled to the Cardiff City Stadium.

Liverpool had been reluctant to meet Sevilla's initial £16million demand and had looked at Ben Davies and Ryan Bertrand as alternatives, as the Spaniards continued to dig their heels in.

But eventually the clubs reached a compromise and all that needs to happen for the deal to be made official is the completion of a medical and personal terms, neither of which are expected to be a problem.

Moreno will join Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana, Dejan Lovren, Divock Origi, Lazar Markovic, Emre Can and Javier Maquillo as additions to the squad that finished second to Manchester City last season.

Liverpool, though, are going to recoup some money immediately as defender Martin Kelly is poised to join Crystal Palace for £1.5million.
