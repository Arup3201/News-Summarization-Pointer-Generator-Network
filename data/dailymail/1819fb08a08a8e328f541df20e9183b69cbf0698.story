Barack Obama last night hit out at his Republican rivals for staying silent when a GOP debate crowd booed a homosexual soldier who asked a question.

During a highly combative speech to an audience of 3,000 gay rights activists, the president said: 'You want to be commander in chief?

'You can start by standing up for the men and women who wear the uniform of the United States, even when it's not politically convenient,'

Recalling the boos soldiers Steven Hill received on September 22 during his videotaped question, which was filmed in Iraq, Mr Obama said: 'We don't believe in standing silent when that happens.'

To loud cheers and a standing ovation at the annual dinner of the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay rights organization, he went on to say: 'We don't believe in a small America.

'We believe 
in a big America - a tolerant America, a just America, an equal America
- that values the service of every patriot.'

The president heralded his administration's work on gay issues, including repealing the military's ban on openly homosexual service members. But he says there is more work to be done in ensuring gay Americans are not discriminated against.

He said: 'We've got more work ahead of us. But we 
can also be proud of the progress we've made these past two and a half 
years. Think about it.

'I need your help to fight for equality,
to pass a repeal of DOMA, to pass an inclusive employment 
non-discrimination bill, so that being gay is never again a fire-able offence in America.

'And I don't have to tell you, there are 
those who don't want to just stand in our way, but want to turn the 
clock back, who want to return to the days when gay people couldn't 
serve their country openly.

'Who reject the progress we've made. Who want to enshrine discrimination in state laws and constitutions -- 
efforts that we've got to work hard to oppose, because that's not what 
America should be about. We're not about restricting rights and 
restricting opportunity.

'You should never have to look over your shoulder — to be gay in the United States of America. Nobody should have to produce a legal contract to hold the hand of the person that they love.'

Obama also compared the fight for gay rights to the fight for civil rights and the equality of African Americans in the country.

'Two years ago, I stood at this podium, in this room, before many of you, and I made a pledge. I said I would never counsel patience; that it wasn’t right to tell you to be patient any more than it was right for others to tell African Americans to be patient in the fight for equal rights a half century ago.

'But what I also said, that while it might take time –- more time than anyone would like -– we are going to make progress, we are going to succeed, we are going to build a more perfect union.'

He also referred to the recent White House summit he held to fight youth bullying and promised his administration would continue to work on it.

He said: 'Together, we also have to keep sending a
message to every young person in this country who might feel alone or 
afraid because they're transgender. They may be getting 
picked on or pushed around because they're different.

'We've got to make 
sure they know there are adults they can talk to, that they are never 
alone, that there is a whole world waiting for them, filled with 
possibility.

'And I want all those kids to know the president and the
first lady is standing right by them every inch of the way. I want them
to know we love them and care about them, and they're not by 
themselves. That's what I want them to know.'

But, as expected, Mr Obama stopped short of endorsing gay marriage, saying only that "every single American deserves to be treated equally in the eyes of the law."

He has said his views on gay marriage are 'evolving', but for now he only supports civil union.

His position on gay marriage has become a sore point for some gay activists who say they're otherwise pleased with the president's handling of issues important to them.

Some of the president's backers say he could be wasting a chance to energize key segments of his base, including young people, if he doesn't publicly advocate for gay marriage.

He recently announced his support of 
the Respect for Marriage Act, a bill that would repeal the Defence of 
Marriage Act, a 1996 law that defines marriage as between a man and a 
woman.

With the President increasingly focused on his 2012 campaign, some gay advocates believe Obama will wait until after the election to make any significant announcement about gay marriage.

Fred Sainz, vice president of communications at the Human Rights Campaign, said he expects Obama to eventually declare his support for gay marriage.

He said the President's position on this issue shouldn't diminish his work on other causes important to the gay community.

They include the repeal of the military's 'don't ask, don't tell' policy and his order that the Justice Department stop defending in court a law defining marriage as between a man and a woman.

'He really has been an incredible champion for the issues that are important to us,' Mr Sainz said. 'It's fair to say we've made more progress in the past two years than we have in the past 40 years combined.'

Even without Obama's backing, a few states have passed legislation legalizing gay marriage - New York was the most recent.

Public sentiment is moving in the direction of supporting gay marriage, with most polls showing people are now about evenly split or narrowly in favour.

Obama has recognized that reality, saying during a meeting with liberal bloggers last October that 'it's pretty clear where the trend lines are going'.

Joe Sudbay of AmericaBlog.com was among the bloggers Obama spoke with last year. He said that while most gay advocates won't stop supporting the president if he doesn't speak out in favour of gay marriage before the election, doing so could give Obama's base much-needed energy.

'He might not lose votes, but he won't gain enthusiasm,' Mr Sudbay said.

Editor of Americablog John Aravosis told CNN they have heard enough speeches but are now ready for action towards real change, especially in relation to gay marriage.
