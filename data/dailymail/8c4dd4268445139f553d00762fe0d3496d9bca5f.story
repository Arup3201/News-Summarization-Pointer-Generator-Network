Bungling air traffic controllers misunderstood a piece of aircraft jargon which could have prevented a 122mph mid-air collision that killed five people, an inquest heard today.

Pilot Brian Normington, 70, was killed when his kit-built Rand KR-2 one-seater aircraft crashed into a twin-engine Cessna 402C plane 700ft above Coventry Airport four years ago in August 2008.

Sophie Hastings, 28 - the pilot of the Cessna, codenamed G-EYES - and her three colleagues, John ‘Harvey’ Antrobus, 28, James Beagley, 34, and Sybille Gautrey, 33, also died.

Killed: John ‘Harvey’ Antrobus (left), 28, and James Beagley (right), 34, were also on the Cessna which crashed

The Cessna, which belonged to aerial survey company Reconnaissance Ventures, was conducting a routine training flight at the time, an inquest at Leamington Justice Centre heard.

The night before the crash the company told air traffic controllers they would be flying at high speed into the airport as part of an exercise to train pilots how to land in bad weather.

But controllers allegedly failed to understand that the terminology for the exercise - ILS calibration work - meant the plane would be flying at low levels into the airport.

The training requires pilots to fly at 122mph towards the runway before suddenly pulling up at 50ft and flying away.

Geraint Herbert, a senior inspector at the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB), said: ‘Air traffic control was unaware of the nature of G-EYES's flight.

‘The company told air traffic control the night before they were going to be doing ILS calibration work but the person who took the message didn’t know what that meant.

‘They ticked the box “Instrument Rating Training” which would mean it would be likely to be flying normal speeds. The full implication of G-EYES's fast speed was not considered.’

The Cessna was cleared to approach to land third in sequence behind Mr Normington’s plane, code named G-BOLZ, the court heard.

Mr Herbert said radar controllers at Coventry Airport instructed Mr Normington to alter his flight path when they realised the two planes were on a collision course.

But tragically the two aircraft crashed seconds after air traffic control informed the Cessna about Mr Normington’s altered plans.

The inspector said he believed the planes
collided at 122mph and it was possible Mr Normington’s small plane 
would only have been visible from the Cessna for seven to 19 seconds 
before the crash.

Air traffic controllers allegedly failed to tell Mr Normington where the Cessna was in relation to his plane.

'Air traffic control must pass 
sufficient information to pilots to enable them to avoid collision. If 
pilots are alerted to the presence of an aircraft then they are eight 
times more likely to see it'

Geraint Herbert

Mr Herbert added: ‘The “see and avoid” principle was compromised by the constant relative bearing between the aircraft, the small size of G-BOLZ and the fast speed of G-EYES.

‘The majority of her attention was probably directed inside the cockpit. The pilot in the right-hand seat was the safety pilot and G-BOLZ would have been obstructed from that right-hand pilot.

‘Air traffic control must pass sufficient information to pilots to enable them to avoid collision. If pilots are alerted to the presence of an aircraft then they are eight times more likely to see it.

Investigation: The first plane came down here - near Coombe Abbey, Brinklow, five miles from Coventry Airport. The second aircraft crashed in nearby Brandon Woods

‘No information was given to the pilot of G-BOLZ (Mr Normington) regarding the presence of G-EYES. And ambiguous information was given to the pilot of G-EYES (Miss Hastings) regarding the presence of G-BOLZ.’

Coroner Sean McGovern said: ‘We are looking into the deaths of five people. Five people died when two aircraft collided in mid-air. It was August 17, 2008. It was a morning. It was a Sunday.

‘Mr Normington was in his own aircraft on his own. The other aircraft had everyone else in. The two women were sitting in the front and the two men were in the back seats.

‘The purpose of their flight was to carry out flight calibration training. Around 10.36am they both were approaching the runway at Coventry Airport. In mid-air they collided and the five people all died.’

The inquest is expected to last for a week.
