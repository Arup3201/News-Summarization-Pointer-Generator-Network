This is the moment a Hungarian shelf-stacker who strangled his lover to death dragged her body in a suitcase to dump it in the park.

Laszlo Gyarmati, 29, who was today jailed for 17 years, was captured on CCTV casually wheeling the bag containing 25 year-old Alexandra Kovacs away from her flat in broad daylight.

He hid the case among the bushes on Dollis Valley Greenwalk in Barnet, north London, less than half a mile away - before sending her a Facebook message reading: 'What's up little chick?'

Tragic: Alexandra Kovacs, left, moved to London from Hungary in 2011. Gyarmati has been jailed for murder, serving a minimum of 17 years in prison. He told the court he was trying to keep Miss Kovacs 'quiet'

The suitcase was found three days later by police dogs.

Today, the jury at the Old Bailey found Gyarmati guilty of murder by a majority of 11 to one after deliberating for five hours and 38 minutes.

He was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 17 years before parole.

Judge Stephen Kramer QC told Gyarmati: 'I'm satisfied that what you did that night was not premeditated. It may be that we shall never know the real motive for what you did. But I do not accept your evidence that you were just trying to keep Miss Kovacs quiet.

'You not only snuffed out Alexandra 
Kovacs's life but in doing so you deprived her friends and family of a 
lively, active young lady.'

Miss Kovacs, who worked for a t-shirt company, moved to Mill Hill, north London, from Hungary two years 
before her death.

On July 17, she met former housemate Gyarmati at a chicken shop before returning to her house at 11pm, a court heard.

At 3am, housemates heard her scream for help but were too scared to investigate.

They did not see her again and reported her missing two days later, on July 20, 2013.

Gyarmati,
 who came to the UK to find work three months before the murder, 
admitted killing Miss Kovacs after they had sex in her house but claimed 
he did not intend to cause serious injury.

He claimed he grabbed her by the throat and put a pillow over her head to keep her quiet during an argument.

Police found Miss Kovacs' body after a tip off from a member of public.

They also found bloodstains on the wall and headboard of her bedroom.

Gyarmati said that after they had sex 
twice Miss Kovacs tried to persuade him to get involved in a sham 
marriage immigration fraud.

He
 told jurors: 'She really wound me up. What wound me up was I told her 
this was not going to work. She said it was going to work because she 
knew better.'

Gyarmati 
added: 'I put the pillow on her face so that she could not be heard, so 
that she should be silent. I thought that someone was going to come in 
but noone did.

'Then I took the pillow off. She didn't move. I realised I had killed her.'

'Screams': Miss Kovacs' housemates in Mill Hill, north London, heard screams but were too scared to investigate

Prosecutor Jonathan Rees QC said: 'Despite the fact that she cried for help and that those cries were heard by other residents, it seems that none of them went to her assistance.

'The following morning the defendant placed the victim's body in a large suitcase belonging to one of the other tenants before wheeling it to a nearby park where he dumped it in the bushes.'

Detective Chief Inspector Nicola Wall,
 Homicide and Major Crime Command, said: 'Alexandra was a young woman 
starting out in life when she was killed by Laszlo Gyarmati. She was 
working very hard sending money back to Hungary to her mum and younger 
brother.

'Alexandra knew 
Gyarmati and was happy to be in his company that evening. She obviously 
had no thoughts that he would hurt her. Sadly he betrayed that trust in 
the ultimate way.

'After he 
killed her Gyarmati took steps to cover his crime by callously putting 
her body in to a suitcase and secreting it in local woodland.'
