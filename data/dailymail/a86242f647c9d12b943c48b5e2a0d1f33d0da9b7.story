It is understood the man met Rudd when he returned to New Zealand following years spent refining his art overseas.

It was alleged that Rudd hired a hit-man to take down two men.

Speaking to the newspaper, the man's cousin said: 'I wouldn't muck around with him at all because he'd have your lights out before you could blink.' 

Earlier on Friday, Tauranga Crown Solicitor confirmed that the procure a murder charge against Rudd had been dropped.

Rudd's lawyer Paul Mabey QC said Crown Solicitor Greg Hollister-Jones had made his decision because there was insufficient evidence to justify the charge.

In a press release, his lawyer defended his client, stating that the claims should never have been laid.

'The charge alleging an attempt to procure murder should never have been laid. The Crown Solicitor's opinion was not sought. The charge is now withdrawn - within 24 hours of Mr Rudd's first appearance in Court,' he said.

'Mr Rudd has suffered unnecessary and extremely damaging publicity as a result of widespread and sensational reporting of a very serious allegation, which on any basis was never justified.'

'The damage to Mr Rudd is incalculable. Questions arise as to the degree of care taken by those responsible for arresting and charging him with Attempting to Procure Murder,'

'Citizens are entitled to a responsible exercise of the power to charge which, as is proved here, can give rise to potentially irreversible damage if that power is not exercised responsibly,'

'Mr Rudd is considering any possible remedies he may have,' he finished.

On Thursday, the 60-year-old musician was charged and appeared in court following a police raid on his North Island home in New Zealand.

Phil Rudd appeared outside his Tauranga house and swore at the media as the news broke that he had been charged with threatening to kill and possession of methamphetamine and cannabis

Earlier, the man allegedly hired as a hitman by Rudd said he was asked to become his bodyguard after the rocker said he was threatened for not paying 'working girls'.

The alleged hitman, whose name has been suppressed, told The Sydney Morning Herald in an exclusive interview, that Rudd was the 'Hugh Hefner of Tauranga' claiming that the amount he spent on 'company is like someone's yearly wage'.The man told Fairfax Media: 'The girls that he gets, working girls and that, they're p***ed off, he tells them "Nah I'm not paying you" and then the partners come and say they want their money.' 

Rudd allegedly attempted to hire a hitman to kill two people, a court heard. The charge was later dropped

The Daily Telegraph reported that the man went on fishing and helicopter trips with Rudd who also allowed him to drive his flashy sports cars.

He added that although Rudd was burning his bridges with those 'who care about him' he was still a 'good fella' with a 'big heart'.

'You’ve got to feel sorry for him – just the expectations everyone has of him,' he said.

When Daily Mail Australia contacted the band's ex-manager, Michael Browning, he had only just heard the news and said it was a 'bit of a shock, but there you go'.

A statement on the band's website said: 'We've only become aware of Phil's arrest as the news was breaking.

'We have no further comment. Phil’s absence will not affect the release of our new album Rock or Bust and upcoming tour next year.'

The legendary drummer also faces drug charges and received bail and will reappear in court on November 27

The ageing rocker was silent during a brief, shoeless appearance in Tauranga District Court that afternoon and has been released on bail until his next appearance on November 27.

According to court documents, Rudd was accused of attempting to hire one person to kill two others between September 25 and September 26. That charge has since been dropped.

He is also accused of threatening to kill a complainant on September 26.

At the request of defence lawyer Tony Rickard-Simms, Rudd was remanded on bail until November 27 when he will reappear in court.

His bail conditions include that he lives at his Bureta home on the North Island and not contact any of the complainants.

Biographer Jesse Fink, author of the new book, The Youngs: The Brothers Who Built AC/DC, said he was 'stunned, absolutely stunned'.

Mr Fink told Daily Mail Australia Rudd had 'deteriorated' in recent years.

'You go back and you see photos of Phil from the '70s, he's a beautiful man, a very handsome man.

'To see someone deteriorate as much as he has is quite alarming.'

The Australian-born drummer has lived in Tauranga for a number of years.

He first moved to New Zealand in 1983 after being sacked by the band, but hooked up with the band again in 1994.

Rudd was noticeably absent from some promotional material and photographs for AC/DC's 16th studio album, Rock or Bust, which will be released in Australia on November 28.

His absence sparked rumours among fans that something was going on.

'I don't think AC/DC did themselves a great service by not saying anything,' Mr Fink said.

'All they did was just fuel the rumour mill, which has been churning for some time now.

In 2011, he opened a restaurant there, Phil's Place, which The New Zealand Herald described as 'upmarket'.

Rudd also released a solo album, Head Job, in September.
