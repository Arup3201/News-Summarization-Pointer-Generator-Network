A grief-stricken father, who lost his wife and newborn twin girls to tuberculosis, spoke for the first time about their deaths and revealed that his wife had never been tested for the disease.

Ruben White, 30, is suing Summerlin Hospital Medical Center in Las Vegas over the deaths of his 25-year-old wife Vanessa and daughters Emma and Abigail.

Mr White choked up as he talked about the terrible loss of his family on Thursday. He told the Las Vegas Review-Journal: 'I would never 
wish this on anyone else. You get the sense that sometimes life is not fair. My hope is that nobody else would have to go through this.'

Loss: Vanessa White and her newborn babies died after she contracted TB meningitis

The
 twin girls were the couple's first children. Mrs White, a dental clerical worker, and her government employee husband had been married for three years at the time of her 
death.

Mrs White had visited the same ER in Las Vegas three times during her pregnancy with a relentless cough which caused her to bring up mucus, a high fever and delirium. She was never tested for tuberculosis, Mr White said.

Mrs White gave birth prematurely in May to twin girls but her health rapidly deteriorated.

TB meningitis - rare in the U.S. - is more deadly than other forms of TB.

Between 1993 and 2005, the Centers for Disease Control recorded 1,649 new cases of TB meningitis.

TBM is passed on through prolonged contact with an infected person.

Early symptoms, like fatigue and aches and pains are often missed.

Symptoms, such as vomiting, headaches, seizures and an aversion to bright lights, don't appear for several weeks.

Treatment can take up to a year but in many cases patients suffer long-lasting effects due to brain-tissue damage.

All of the people found to have contracted the infection are being treated with antibiotics.

She watched as three-week-old Emma died on June 1 from respiratory problems.

Despite rounds of heavy antibiotics, Mrs White, a lifelong member of the Church of Jesus Christ Latter Day Saints, passed away on July 1.

It was only when an autopsy was conducted that doctors discovered she had TB.

Surviving twin Abigail was quickly diagnosed with TB and placed in isolation but died from the disease a few weeks later. Emma had never been tested for TB.

Testing of family, friends and hospital 
employees conducted after Mrs White's death in July found 26 people 
tested positive for the infection. Two of those had the contagious form, while the rest had inactive TB.

Mr White's attorney Robert Cottle said on Thursday: 'There were multiple diagnostic failures. Lives would've been saved had tuberculosis been thought of in May or June.'

According to the lawyer, doctors conducted 
multiple tests, but didn't pursue the possibility of TB after a nurse 
screened for symptoms and ruled out the condition.

He added: 'No one connected the dots in this case, and as you can see, the dots were very obvious.'

A Nevada Bureau of Health Care investigation found that Summerlin Hospital didnâ€™t take basic precautions to stop the spread of infection - but facility leaders still say they followed protocol, according to the Review-Journal.

Mrs White was allowed to visit one of her twins in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit while she had a 103-fever and was not wearing a mask or gown.

Mr White said on Thursday: 'We would never want to cause any harm to our babies, so we would have done whatever it took.

'There was nothing ever told to us about anything other than regular washing of your hands when going into the NICU.'

The hospital issued a statement expressing sympathy for the family, but saying it took appropriate steps in the case.

'Medical experts who have 
already reviewed this matter have confirmed there was no reason to 
suspect that the patient had TB and an appropriate screening was 
performed,' the statement said.

Outbreak: Families of babies born at Summerlin Hospital in Las Vegas were tested for TB following the deaths of a mother and her newborn babies

Health
 officials later expanded the testing to include about 140 babies and 
their family members who spent time in Summerlin Hospital's neonatal 
intensive care unit over the summer. The results of that round of tests, initiated in October, have not been released.

Officials
 with the Southern Nevada Health District said it appears that Mrs White 
contracted the disease from an unpasteurized dairy product from overseas.

Lawyers plan to seek damages and changes in hospital policy.

One theory is that the delayed diagnosis may have come because the disease is relatively rare in the U.S.

Symptoms
 can often be overlooked because the first signs of infection include 
gentle aches and pains, that gradually become worse after eight weeks.

'TB
 can be very subtle, particularly as many doctors have not had much 
experience with TB these days,' Dr William Schaffner, professor of 
preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University 
School of Medicine, said.

The
 infection is spread through prolonged contact with a patient who is at 
the contagious stage, where symptoms include coughing and spluttering.

Babies who may have been exposed to the 
disease are unlikely to catch it, according to chief medical officer Dr 
Joe Iser, but officials want widespread testing 'through an abundance of
 caution'.
