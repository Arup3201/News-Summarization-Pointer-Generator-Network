Sir David Frost was a household name on both sides  of the Atlantic, interviewing almost as many US presidents as British prime ministers.

But his early attempts to make it in America so infuriated his BBC bosses they considered dropping him altogether.

Letters published for the first time today show Corporation chiefs who signed up the 25-year-old as the £600-a-week host of Not So Much A Programme More A Way Of Life were horrified to discover he was committed to presenting a show from New York at the same time.

Back in the days: Sir David Frost's early attempts to make it in America in the 1960s infuriated his BBC bosses

In a letter dated November 20, 1964, Donald Baverstock, controller of BBC 1, wrote to a colleague: ‘I was surprised and a little alarmed to find that Frost was leaving every Monday for New York and returning on Thursday of each week.

‘As I recollect, one of the reasons why we had to go as high as we did was his agent’s reminder of the money in America he was turning down  to do this programme.’

Frost, star of That Was The Week That Was, had originally demanded £1,000 a week to reflect ‘his standing and success in this country and in America’.

Letters reveal senior BBC staff considered dropping Sir David altogether after finding out about his U.S. work

Baverstock added in his letter: ‘We must watch the situation very carefully. His option to continue beyond the initial six weeks should not be taken up without further discussion between you and I.’

The BBC 1 head quit soon afterwards to join Yorkshire TV.  

But Frost, who died last year aged 74, only increased his Atlantic commuting and in 1977 achieved a career high when  he extracted an apology from Richard Nixon over Watergate.
