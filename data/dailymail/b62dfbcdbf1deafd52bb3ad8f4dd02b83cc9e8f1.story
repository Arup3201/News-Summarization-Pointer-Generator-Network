Some drivers have been charged £2 a tank more for petrol than motorists in neighbouring towns over Easter due to some retailers failing to pass on a dip in wholesale petrol costs

Millions of motorists are paying up to £2 more a time to fill up than drivers in neighbouring towns in a petrol pricing lottery, the AA warned yesterday.

Drivers have been left ‘high and dry’ by the widespread differences in fuel costs prompted by a refusal by some forecourts to pass on a recent drop in wholesale petrol prices.

And the motoring group warned that prices across the country are expected to jump again in the next few weeks, bringing misery  to small businesses and families who rely on their cars.

Average prices hit a year high of 140p a litre at the start of last month, but have since fallen back to a current average of 137.8p.

But across the country there remain large discrepancies in what forecourts are charging, even in towns a few miles apart.

In Canterbury, the cheapest petrol available on Tuesday was 134.7p for a litre of unleaded.

But in nearby Dover, the best price was 138.9p – about £2 extra to fill up a tank.

The best deal in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, was 137.9p a litre, over three pence more than the 134.7p charged just 20 miles away in Milton Keynes.

And in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, the cheapest petrol was 134.7p per litre compared with 138.9p, 11 miles down the road in New Ollerton.

The AA said most towns enjoying cheaper prices have a Sainsbury’s which sells petrol.

The supermarket giant recently dropped prices by 4p a litre to reflect the reduction in wholesale costs, prompting forecourts in surrounding areas to do the same in order to remain competitive.

Wholesale petrol costs started to rise again last week as the market anticipated greater demand with the start of the United States' motoring season

Luke Bosdet, spokesman for the AA, 
said: ‘In towns where there isn’t a Sainsbury’s selling petrol, there is
much less incentive for petrol stations to reduce their charges.’

And in a double blow for motorists, 
he also warned petrol prices were expected to rise further as global 
demand increased in the coming months.

He said: ‘Larger companies will be 
able to ride out the hikes, but many others will have to make a bleak 
choice. Some motorists who can’t afford any more rises are simply going 
to spend the same amount on fuel each month and stop driving when they 
run out.

‘Others, especially tradesmen who 
rely on using cars or vans, will either have to take it on the chin, or 
pass it on to customers, which risks losing customers and potentially 
going to the wall. It’s a very grim situation.’

The AA said average diesel prices 
continue to fall, down from a year high of 146.46p a litre on March 4 to
143.57p on Easter Monday.

Record fuel prices were set in April last year, with petrol hitting 142.48p a litre and diesel 147.91p.

AA president Edmund King said: ‘Fuel 
pricing in the UK, US, and Europe over the past 12 months has been 
characterised by a series of severe spikes, surging petrol prices up and
down by the equivalent of 10p a litre. This has had a severe impact on 
consumer demand.

‘Although previous price spikes since
the 1970s have eventually been offset by improved wages, the extent and
severity of price swings since 2008 are likely to have a lasting 
impact.’

He added: ‘Unlike the US, drivers in the UK and Europe have been left high and dry by the lack of fuel price transparency.

‘This has denied them the ability to 
spot short-term pump price spikes. It has also allowed retailers to 
decide when and where savings for this essential part of family spending
are passed on.’
