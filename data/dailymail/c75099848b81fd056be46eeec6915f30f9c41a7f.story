Kristie Macrakis’s  gripping study of secret writing in its hidden or invisible form is chiefly a history of espionage techniques, or what John le  Carré used to call tradecraft.

Though, as Macrakis says, ‘invisible ink conjures up images of childhood magic and fun’ — a world of wonder encompassing card tricks, numerology and rabbits appearing from hats — the subject of sleight-of-hand actually impinges on notions of death and danger, privacy, freedom, and the cancer of state surveillance.

Macrakis has spent her career in the archives, sifting through declassified documents, familiarising herself with chemicals and abstruse formulae — and the history of invisible inks and surreptitious communication is a long one. 

Master spy: Daniel Craig as the famous James Bond

The story begins in Ancient Greece and Rome, when messages were hidden in the belly of a hare, the incision sewn up, and then the creature handed to a trusted servant in a hunting net. Two thousand years later, the gambit was still in force. The CIA used freeze-dried rats as concealment devices.

Greek generals sent messages to their commanders by scrawling with the juice of medicinal herbs or ‘the milky substance from wild figs’. The parchment was allowed to dry. When later it was sprinkled with ashes, the letters became visible.

Another useful ink was urine, which became readable when covered with dust. Messages could also be scratched on wax-coated tablets, or on rolled-up beaten lead worn as earrings. Sheets of papyrus were inserted into bridles or breastplates.

Spies sent messages hidden in dog collars or engraved them on toenails, which were revealed with powdered charcoal. In China, the emperor wrote on silk, rolled it in a ball, covered the pellet with wax, called for the messenger and placed it in his rectum. The chaps at Parcelforce don’t know they are born.

In a more credulous age, invisible writing was seen as a branch of the necromantic arts. Because he recommended trapping a dormouse and extracting its juices to use as invisible ink, in 1558 Giambattista della Porta was examined by the Inquisition. It looked like the work of the Devil, a text appearing when the paper was heated — made ‘visible through fire’.

Elizabethan England, using tricks perfected in the monasteries, was a particular age of secrecy and intrigue, and Francis Walsingham’s network of agents and informants was always finding evidence of Catholic plots concealed in wine bottles or wedged in embroidered slippers. ‘Secret letters were placed in a waterproof box and stuffed through the bunghole of a beer barrel.’

The supporters of Mary Queen of Scots plotted a rebellion against the throne — and Walsingham (Geoffrey Rush in the Cate Blanchett film Elizabeth) found messages scratched with pickling juice inscribed between the lines of bibles and prayer books. The corner of pages would be snipped as a signal that something was written on it.

The material was intercepted and the conspirators tortured on the rack, hanged, drawn and quartered.

Walsingham also craftily forged letters, asking for the names and addresses of confederates — men who were also then disembowelled and hanged. Mary herself was beheaded in 1587.

Less dramatically, invisible ink has  been used to decorate fire-screens. Impregnated with cobalt chloride, the panels would depict images as they warmed up.

Scientists such as Robert Boyle, using a mixture of sulphur and ammonium chloride, in the 1670s wrote notes and calculations invisibly  in exercise-books — to prevent a  theft of their ideas. Owing to the  smell, the gullible again suspected ‘occult processes.’

But it was always during wars that this branch of cryptography — of codes and ciphers — was most prized. By 1915, MI5 was monitoring the mail of 13,524 citizens, opening the post sent to foreign addresses. By these means German double-agents were discovered, who were using lemon juice to tell the enemy about British troop movements.

Scotland Yard found blotting paper, nibs and lemons in the accused’s lodgings. The fresh, juicy lemon was prime evidence at the trial, and the spies were shot at the Tower of London.

Spies were found to hide their inks — generally slightly more sophisticated than lemons — in medicine bottles, soap, toothpaste, chewing gum, and pomade. It was even soaked into pairs of socks. Agents during the Cold War were issued with special pens and pads. Detection and concealment grew ever more ingenious, with ultraviolet and infrared photography to reveal messages, ferrous oxides with which to sponge the paper, and microscopic analysis of documents to trace alien particles or the indentation of fibres.

‘Every contact leaves a trace,’  says Macrakis, sounding like Sherlock Holmes.

The biggest new development was the invention of the microdot by Emanuel Goldberg in 1925, which meant files could be reduced to the size of postage stamps or full-stops on typed letters.

During World War II, the Americans arrested saboteurs who were using microdots to collaborate with the Nazis’ quest for information about atomic energy, and who were also sending Berlin reports about the extent of the destruction of American oil stores at Pearl Harbor. The spies went to the electric chair.

With cyberspace and the internet, today we have come a long way from lemons — though human deviousness is the same. The contemporary equivalent of Walsingham is a ‘computer forensic investigator’.

Cyber spying: Al-Qaeda, founded by Osama Bin Laden (pictured), apparently exchange hidden messages in pornography

Apparently, Al Qaeda exchange hidden messages in the pixels of digital pornographic movies.

So that’s what they are doing all day in GCHQ at Cheltenham, watching Sexy Tanja over and over.

But a good job they are — as concealed in the binary codes of one film’s text files were plans about seizing hostages on a passenger ship.

Images on eBay auction sites are also terrorist hiding places. Were I an evil mastermind I’d utilise tapes of Dickinson’s Real Deal — who’d think to look there?

The former Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc police routinely opened the mail, tapped phones and monitored and mistrusted their own citizens. The Stasi had automated equipment to slit open envelopes, copy and re-seal the post.

Macrakis is correct to argue the secret services in Western democracies have always envied the enemy’s brutality in this regard — and since 9/11 they have been granted and now enjoy totalitarian powers ‘to read everyone’s email with one keystroke’. We can’t go out of the door without being on some government CCTV camera.

It is as if the Inquisition is back, and ‘the hidden is exposed. The invisible becomes visible. The obscure is deciphered. The unknown becomes known. Betrayal is unmasked.’

And all future thoughts of (or rights to) a private life are obliterated. Scary. Big Brother has been born.
