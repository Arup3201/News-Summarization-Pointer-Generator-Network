Wheeled into a court hearing, hands and arms cuffed and wearing a bright yellow jump suit, stripper Lee Grace Dougherty had little to smile about as she faced potential attempted murder and first-degree assault charges yesterday.

But the 29-year-old who is accused along with her two brothers of a three-state crime spree showed off her ability to pose, perhaps garnered from her time as a hardcore pornography model, as she made her first court appearance yesterday.

Swinging her hair back and laughing in front of the cameras, the former topless dancer looked like she was still performing as she appeared by video link.

Beaming: Lee Grace Dougherty seemed to be practising her posing skills learnt from her time as a hardcore porn model as she attended a court hearing yesterday

The oldest of the trio of heavily armed siblings, Dougherty, who had become America's most wanted woman, was captured in Colorado on Wednesday after a 20 mile car chase with speeds of up to 120 mph and subsequent shoot out.

Speaking out for the first time, Dougherty's fiancé Brendon Bookman said that she had admitted making mistakes.

'She just said, “Honey, your girlfriend really screwed up”,' he told Good Morning America of a phone call she made from jail.

'Considering what she has allegedly gone through, was lucid and coherent and sounded pretty normal.'

As the three made attended their court appearance from jail, it emerged that just days before the gang allegedly robbed a Georgia bank last week that Dougherty had stripped for a hardcore photo shoot.

A source connected to the erotic shoots, which had been going on over the past six weeks, told TMZ that she posed for some photos as recently as July 29, less than a week before the robbery.

Police documents released at the hearing revealed for the first time that Dougherty had admitted she pointed a machine pistol at a Colorado police officer before he shot her.

'I pointed the gun at the cop... I deserved to get shot,' Lee Grace Dougherty told an agent with the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, according to an arrest affidavit.

'[I]nstantly, I let go of the gun... The pain was all through my body.'

Dougherty, who briefly danced at a topless club in Cocoa Beach, Florida, sustained a non-life threatening gunshot wound to her right thigh and was still in a wheelchair yesterday.

She waived her right to remain silent
and spoke to detectives following the high-speed chase and shootout on 
Wednesday that ended with a car crash and her arrest, along with 
brothers Ryan Edward Dougherty, 21, and Dylan Dougherty Stanley, 26.

The
siblings were wanted for what authorities say was a crime spree in 
which they were accused of shooting at a Florida police officer and 
robbing a bank in Georgia.

They
were ordered held on $1.2 million bond each by a Colorado judge on 
Thursday and face potential attempted murder and first-degree assault 
charges against a peace officer, Bobbi Griffin, district administrator 
for the 10th Judicial District, said in a written statement.

The
affidavit described a harrowing high-speed chase, as the Subaru Impreza
driven by Ryan Dougherty weaved in and out of traffic through 
construction zones and highway shoulders at speeds reaching 120 miles 
per hour, while Dylan Dougherty Stanley fired an AK-47 at pursuing 
officers.

Lee Dougherty told investigators that the fugitives shot at police, but 'we weren't trying to hurt anyone, we just wanted them to get back.'

Lee and Ryan Dougherty were arrested 
after fleeing the scene on foot when the vehicle swerved to avoid stop 
sticks and crashed into a highway median, the affidavit said.

Dylan Dougherty Stanley remained in the wrecked vehicle, where he was arrested.

Police said they recovered two assault rifles, a submachine gun and a handgun from the car.

Kevin
Doll, a spokesman for the Pasco County, Florida Sheriff's Office, said 
the agency sent two detectives to Colorado to try to interview the 
suspects.

Their next court appearance in Colorado is scheduled for August 15.
