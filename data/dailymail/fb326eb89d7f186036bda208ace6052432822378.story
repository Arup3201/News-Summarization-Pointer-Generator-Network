The Mail on Sunday’s sensational scoop about the Co-op Bank chairman Paul Flowers’ drug-taking and consorting with rent boys won a top honour at the 2014 British Journalism Awards last week.

Reporters Nick Craven and Ross Slater were presented with the Breaking News Award for the best story of the year.

Winning story: The Mail on Sunday front page story on Co-op Bank chairman Paul Flowers’ drug-taking

The judges felt the Flowers front-page story was a great example of journalism ‘which held the powerful to account’.

They added: ‘At its heart was a genuine public interest story. How could somebody like Paul Flowers get appointed to such an important position?’
