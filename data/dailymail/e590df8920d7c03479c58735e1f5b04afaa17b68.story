Instead, she treated the wound herself with antiseptic wipes and bleach.

But it quickly became infected and the popular pub landlady developed septicaemia. Two days later she was dead.

At an inquest into her death, friends said 51-year-old Miss Banks loved rottweiler Brannigan ‘to bits’ because he had once saved her from a fire.

One said: ‘Brannigan meant everything to Lesley. He was hailed a hero after he saved Lesley from a fire at her pub.

‘If he hadn’t woken her up she would 
almost certainly have died, it’s so tragic she died after he bit her. He
was a big gentle giant, he never meant any harm and Lesley would never 
hear a word against him. 

‘She didn’t see a doctor because she 
thought if it came out that Brannigan bit her the authorities would 
either take him away or he would be put to sleep.’

The inquest in Hereford was told 
Brannigan had been nominated for a bravery award after he saved his 
owner from a burning building in October 2009.

Fire had broken out in the living 
quarters above the Three Horseshoes pub in Wheathill, Bridgnorth, 
Shropshire, where Miss Banks was the resident landlady.

Brannigan, then aged seven, had woken
Miss Banks, who was not married and had no children, by repeatedly 
tugging on her arm as the flat filled with smoke. They both managed to 
escape.

After the drama Miss Banks, who had 
been at the pub for 18 years, praised Brannigan for his actions. She 
said: ‘I am so grateful to Brannigan.

He probably saved my life. I was asleep and the dog jumped on my bed.

He began to pull at my arm which normally means something is wrong.’

The inquest heard Brannigan had 
bitten her once on the right hand as she put him into the back of her 
car following a pheasant shoot in Craswall, Herefordshire, on August 14 last year.

Fearing he would be destroyed for 
biting her, Miss Banks refused to go to her doctor’s surgery for 
treatment and instead treated the bite herself at home.

But the following day she became seriously ill with diarrhoea and vomiting after the wound became infected.

She went on to develop septicaemia. A
friend finally persuaded her to contact a doctor on August 16 but by 
then it was too late and, despite receiving emergency medical help, Miss
Banks died the same day.

Recording a verdict of accidental 
death, deputy coroner of Herefordshire Roland Wooderson said: ‘Dog 
owners should be aware of the possible outcomes from bites.’

But he added: ‘Miss Banks had been bitten by her dog before with no lasting ill effects.’

Brannigan, who never received a formal award for the fire rescue, has since been put down.
