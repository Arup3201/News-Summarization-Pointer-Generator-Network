Nicole Appleton was all smiles today despite rumours that her five-year marriage to former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher is over.

The former All Saints singer was pictured surrounded by her children and family, including her sister Natalie, while holidaying in Florida.

She gave the appearance of not having a care in the world, despite reports that she was 'distraught' in the wake of allegations that Gallagher fathered a child with an American journalist.

The 38-year-old wore white sunglasses, an American Football jersey and shorts for the trip - but was not wearing her wedding ring.

high spirits.

It comes in the wake of reports that 
Liam Gallagher's management sacked his personal assistant for becoming 
'too close' to the rock star in a further twist to his tumultuous love 
life.

And on Friday, Miss Gwyther was nowhere to be seen as Gallagher played at Spain's Benicasim Festival with his band Beady Eye.

A source told The Sun: 'Liam and 
Debbie have become too close for comfort for management. It doesn’t look
good for them if there appears to be flirting between an employee and 
their star. She has left - but not on her own terms.'

Onlookers

One added: 'They looked incredibly relaxed in each other’s company - just like a couple.

'They weren’t holding hands or 
anything like that - but obviously there were other people around. His 
minders seemed desperate for them not to be pictured together.'

Gallagher was supposed to have joined
them on the holiday, according to The Sun, but stayed away as 
allegations of his infidelity spread.

Gallagher has said he is suing over the claims, but there have been further reports that their marriage is in trouble.

Yesterday it was claimed Gallagher has given up hope of 
saving his marriage, saying he is 'sick and tired' of allegations that he had a baby with 38-year-old American journalist Liza Ghorbani.

He
insists the claims are completely untrue but doesn't think his marriage
to the former All Saints singer is worth saving, it was reported.

Nicole's mother Mary said that Liam 
has not spoken to his wife since breaking the news that he was the man 
at the centre of the lovechild claims.

Mary, 72, told the Mail on Sunday her daughter found out about the rock star’s supposed affair during a cursory phone call last Wednesday.

The Sun reported at the weekend that Gallagher has told friends their marriage is over.

Appleton's father Ken told the paper: 'I have been speaking to Nicole every day since this broke. She is shocked and upset.

'She is with family at the moment recovering.'

Along with Gene, former Oasis singer Gallagher has two other children - one with former wife Patsy Kensit, and one with singer Lisa Moorish.

Beady Eye star Gallagher and Appleton have been married since 2008 and have a 12-year-old son Gene.
