Motorists are to get a record £6billion boost to help remove the ‘menace’ of 18 million potholes from local roads over the next six years, Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin announced today.

The £1billion a year share-out to town halls will help English local authorities tackle potholes and improve local roads between 2015 and 2021 while giving them time to plan ahead.

But as an ‘incentive’ to boost pre-emptive repairs and end the last-minute ‘patch and mend culture’, an increasing proportion of the available cash will have to be won by councils bidding with the most innovative and cost-efficient longer-term schemes to keep their roads in good condition.

As a result, the amount available to councils ‘without strings’ in the general repair pot will diminish over the six years.

By contrast, the ‘incentive’ element – which has to be bid for and can be won only by showing improvements and value for money -will increase year to year.

Local government leaders said even the £6billion total will leave a hole because the current backlog of repairs alone would take more than a decade and cost £12billion twice as much - to put right.

A succession of severe winters and the devastating floods earlier this year have left councils playing catch-up with road maintenance.

The size of the £6billion pot-hole and repairs pot was announced originally in the Government’s Spending review of June 2013 but how it will be divided up between competing local authorities in England was announced today (Tuesday).

Mr McLoughlin said the investment amounts to £976million a year - enough to fix around 18 million potholes across the country over six years – or 3 million a year. He said it is the first time councils have been given ‘locked-in’ funding over this length of time, which will help them plan ahead and save money for the taxpayer.

Of the total £6billion package, just over £4.7billion will be shared between 115 English councils. But councils will also be able to bid for a further £575million in total available for the repair and maintenance of local highway infrastructure such as junctions, bridges and street lighting.

However, Mr McLoughlin also announced that £578million had been set aside for an innovative incentive fund scheme starting in 2016 to reward councils who demonstrate they are delivering ‘value for money’ in carrying out cost-effective improvements can bid for specific extra cash. But the cash in the general pot will reduce from £901million in 2016 to £725million a year from 210/19 to 2021 inclusive as the incentive element is ratcheted up.

Ministers argue that those who move away from the ‘patch and mend’ mentality plan ahead pre-emptively with more certainty to improve road surfaces well before the cracks, will get more ‘incentive’ cash. The aim is ‘to reward councils who demonstrate they are delivering high value for money to the taxpayer in carrying out cost effective planned improvements’ and ‘making the available money go even further.’

Mr McLoughlin said: ‘Roads play a significant part in everyday life. Poorly-maintained local roads, blighted by potholes, are a menace to all road users, particularly during the festive period as people travel to see family and friends.

‘It is vital we have good quality roads. This Government has already taken strong action by spending £1 billion more on local roads maintenance than was spent in the previous parliament.’

He added: ‘This £6billion funding will put an end to short-term fixes and will mean we have committed £10billion between 2010 and 2021. This huge investment is part of our long-term economic plan to ensure we have a transport network fit for the 21st century.’

A Transport Department source said: ‘Potholes are a menace for all road users. He said: ‘Today we are setting out exactly what each local authority will get and announcing that the funding is being allocated over six years. This is the first time local authorities have been provided with certain funding over this length of time, allowing them to plan and allocate resources. Normally it is an annual allocation.’

Matthew Lugg, director of public services for Mouchel Infrastructure Services and advocate for the Highways Agency Efficiency Programme, explained: ‘Councils who think about long term planning and how they work together to share their resources, achieve greater economies of scale and keep the road surface in good repair, ensuring value for money for the taxpayer. Today’s announcement by the Government will help to deliver this.’

Professor Stephen Glaister, director of the RAC Foundation, said: ‘This money has to be measured against the scale of the problem. It only amounts to about half of the £12billion or so road maintenance backlog in England estimated by councils themselves. There are also question marks over the bidding element of the funding. Would it not be better to simply allocate it all on the basis of need?’

The Professor added: ‘Tackling the poor state of local roads routinely tops the list of transport priorities for voters and drivers. No wonder, when at least 45,000 compensation claims were made in the last financial year against councils for damage caused to vehicles by pot holes.

As many as one in six (16 per cent) of drivers have been left with damage to their vehicle in the past 12 months, according to a recent survey from LV Road Rescue.
