A driver who asked a garage to fix his BMW with faulty brakes was amazed when a mechanic took it on a 92mph drive before it had been repaired.

Gary Brown, 40, had fitted a GPS tracking device to his car which clocked every time the vehicle was over the speed limit by the worker.

Within minutes of the BMW 6 series leaving his house, the car had been recorded doing 92.4mph on the M4 motorway near Reading, Berkshire. It was later also recorded doing 33mph in a 30mph zone.Scroll down for video

Mr Brown, 40, had arranged for the vehicle to be collected by Servicing Stop - a company which scooped a £100,000 investment on Dragons' Den.

The online company gives customers a quote and then commissions a local garage to pick-up the car and carry out the work.

Gary’s car was taken away by a mechanic who didn’t realise he had installed a tracking device in case his vehicle was ever stolen.

The £110 small black TrackYour GPS device was set up so it sent him a text message every time the car is recorded breaking the speed limit.

The device can then also beam back the vehicle's coordinates so it is possible to work out exactly where it is.

Gary, from Thatcham, Berkshire, said: 'I can’t believe how irresponsibly someone was driving my car - especially because they knew it needed new brakes.

'It was so dangerous - the car might not have been able to stop quickly at such high speeds.

'I’ll never let anyone I don’t know drive one of my cars again, and I definitely won’t be using Servicing Stop again, that’s for sure.'

Gary called Service Stop and explained his dashboard brake light alert had come on and said he thought the brake pads probably needed replacing.

The car was collected just before 9am on Thursday November 7 by a worker from Karcare Services who drove the vehicle 17 miles to their garage in Reading.

Gary said: 'My car said the pads needed servicing. I knew it would be safe to go a few more miles, but I didn’t want to put myself in any danger.

'I called Servicing Stop as I had done in the past and told them what was wrong with my car, and they said they’d send someone round to pick it up.

'But about ten minutes after it was collected from my home, I was stunned to receive a text from the device saying that my car had broken the speed limit.

'I then monitored the situation quite closely, and saw the car got up to well over 90mph. I just can’t believe the guy drove in such a reckless way.'

The car was returned at 4pm and Gary was billed £450 to cover the cost of fitting new front brake pads.

Servicing Stop won a £100,000 investment from businesswoman Deborah Meaden when they pitched their business on BBC2’s Dragons’ Den, in 2009.

But after the show, brothers Oly and Toby Richmond, the company founders, were unable to reach an agreement with Deborah, and the deal collapsed.

A spokesman for the firm said one of their sub-contractors treated Gary’s car in a 'distressing' manner.

He said: 'Servicing Stop are aware of an incident on the November 7 whereby a member of staff from a sub-contracted garage exceeded the relevant speed limit in a clients’ vehicle, such circumstances are unacceptable and after considering our audit teams findings we have undertaken a disciplinary action against the garage in question.

'Alongside this our audit team have presented control recommendations which will be implemented as we look to ensure that Servicing Stop protect our clients and provide them with the quality of service we all expect.

'Whilst we are confident that the scheduled works on the vehicle were completed to the standards expected, this does not detract from the severity of this case and we are sympathetic to the distress and inconvenience this matter has caused our client.'

Karcare Services were unwilling to comment.
