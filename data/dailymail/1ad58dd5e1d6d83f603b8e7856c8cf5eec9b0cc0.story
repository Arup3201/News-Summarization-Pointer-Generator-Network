A police officer shot a 17-year-old runaway in the wrist at a Hawaii 
high school today after the teen cut one officer with a knife and punched two 
others, authorities said.

The shooting happened at Roosevelt High School in Honolulu around 8.30am with the building being placed on immediate lock down.

State Department of Education spokeswoman Donalyn Dela Cruz said the boy showed up on Tuesday morning at the school. Officials there recognized him as a runaway who was not registered for classes and called police.

Shots were fired on Tuesday morning at Roosevelt High School in Honolulu by a police officer after a teenage boy allegedly tried to attack him with a knife

A shooting took place at Roosevelt High School in Honolulu early on Tuesday morning

Major Richard Robinson, commander of the Honolulu Police Department's Criminal Investigations Division, said the boy lunged at officers who arrived at the public high school near downtown Honolulu and tried to take him into custody.

Robinson said the teen attacked one of the officers with a knife, leaving him with a minor cut on his torso. He also punched two other officers, but neither suffered serious injuries, he said.

One of the officers then fired two shots, hitting the boy once in the wrist. The teen was hospitalized with non-life-threatening injuries, Major Robinson said.

The shooting prompted a lockdown at Roosevelt, which has an enrollment of about 1,500 students.

Kealii Akiona-Soares, said he was in social studies class when he heard a faint shot at about 8.20am.

Then a school bell sounded and students were kept in their classrooms, the 17-year-old junior said. He said his class continued with a politics lessons, and everyone kept mostly calm.

'I guess it happens a lot in mainland schools, so it's not surprising,' Akiona-Soares said.

Parents, including Carolyn Richardson, gathered outside the school after word of the shooting spread.

'This is really freaking me out,' Ms Richardson said. She learned about the shooting around 9am after receiving a text from her son CarDarow, a sophomore.

CarDarow told her he heard shots had been fired at the school, but that he was OK.

She then used her cellphone to video chat with her son. 'I told him, I gotta hear your voice,' Ms Richardson said.

A steady stream of students filed out of campus, with many reuniting with their parents at around 10am.
