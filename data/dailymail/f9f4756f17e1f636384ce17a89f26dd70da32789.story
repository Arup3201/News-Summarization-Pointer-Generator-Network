If you've got an old painting gathering dust in the attic, now is the time to get it down to an auction house.

While Austerity Britain languishes in the doldrums, with rising inflation and low wage increases, the art market is one sector that is booming.

And figures released by Sotheby's in London show that the auction house sold almost £1billion of fine art in 2011, according to Companies House - one of the best financial results in its 268-year history.

Big sellers at Sotheby's in London last year included Pablo Picasso's La Lecture, which went for £25.2million

Francesco Guardi's Venice, A View Of The Rialto Bridge, Looking North, From The Fondamenta Del Carbon, sold for £26.7million. It was the biggest seller of the year for Sotheby's, which recorded bumper billion-pound sales

Total sales at Sotheby's, based in New Bond Street, reached £930million, about £50million more than in 2010.

Last year, global art sales topped nearly £36billion - with the UK taking a sizeable chunk.

Francesco Guardi's Venice, A View Of The Rialto Bridge, Looking North, From The Fondamenta Del Carbon, sold for £26.7million.

Culture Minister Ed Vaizey slapped an export ban on it in October to allow time for someone to come up with the money to keep the painting in Britain.

Other big sellers included Pablo 
Picasso's La Lecture, which went for £25.2million and Salvador Dali's 
Portrait De Paul Eluard, which fetched £13.5million.

Egon Schiele's House With Laundry (Suburb II) - a rare 1914 suburban townscape - yielded £24.6million

Egon Schiele's House With Laundry (Suburb II) - a rare 1914 suburban townscape - yielded £24.6million.

Bill Ruprecht, the company's president and CEO, said: 'Sotheby’s had great success last year, handling masterpieces, innovating in new markets and building trust based relationships with clients globally and our 2011 financial results reflected those efforts.

'They are near the best we have ever delivered.'

Further highlights from last year included Francis Bacon's Three Studies For A Portrait Of Lucian Freud which reached £23million.

It came from a private collection which itself broke records when it fetched £93.5million.

London Sotheby's results are all the more impressive given that it has to contend with rivals such as Christie's and Bonhams as well as sister houses internationally.

Mr Ruprecht told the Independent: 'We have now reached the point where the three geographic engines driving our auction business - the Americas, Europe and Asia - are contributing to our success in roughly equal proportions.'

Upcoming sales which will no doubt boost the firm's coffers include Edvard Munch's The Scream, which could reach £50.5million when it goes to auction in New York - along with an Andy Warhol portrait of Elvis, expected to fetch £30million.

Meanwhile, another Warhol - a screen print of portrait of Brigitte Bardot - will be up for sale in London in May as part of a 300-work collection once owned by German industrialist Gunter Sachs.

Despite the high sales figures, Sotheby's suffered a slight fall in revenue and pre-tax profit, which were £152.6million and £50.6million respectively.
