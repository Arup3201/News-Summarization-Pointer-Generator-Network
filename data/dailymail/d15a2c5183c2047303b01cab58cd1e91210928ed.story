As King's Cross reopened today, disgruntled passengers forced to cancel their journeys yesterday were outraged when crammed services were held outside the station for up to an hour due to signal failure. 

Scores took to social media to share their fury after being held outside Finsbury Park station - where hundreds flocked after King's Cross closed yesterday - because of the technical fault. 

After waiting outside the north London train station for up to an hour, passengers were then not allowed to disembark as trains were shunted onto another line to make their way to Kings Cross.

Elsewhere those travelling on cross-country services had to stand in carriage aisles for up to five hours after losing seat reservations in yesterday's disruption.

The Office of Rail Regulation has launched an investigation into why engineers were able to continue working on the tracks yesterday, cancelling the journeys of hundreds of passengers.  

Trains were leaving Kings Cross today again as planned, though several others were held for up to an hour at nearby Finsbury Park while waiting to arrive at the central London station.

Engineers were forced to use red and yellow flags to manually wave trains in and out of the station this evening as tensions flared.  

East Coast trains told customers to expect delays of up to 20minutes, though passengers said delays were closer to an hour. 

'So close and yet so far...10 mins away but now in a queue to get in to King's Cross due to signal failure at Finsbury Park,' said one Twitter user, while another angered: 'Now stuck at Finsbury Park, waiting for our train to be shunted onto another track. 45 minutes, and counting.' 

Yesterday's planned improvements on tracks leading into the station overran, scuppering the journeys of hundreds of people.  

'The immediate priority is for Network Rail to ensure disrupted parts of the railways are back up and running again for passengers as soon as possible,' a spokesman for the ORR told MailOnline.

Passengers on trains to Edinburgh from London, one of the worst affected routes yesterday, complained of overcrowding as they were forced to stand in aisles and sit on the floor despite purchasing tickets

'Network Rail, working with the rest of the industry, must learn lessons and prevent problems like this happening again.

'ORR is investigating overrunning works. We will also be reviewing the standard of passenger information during disruptions - with a focus on whether passengers have been adequately informed to make alternative arrangements to their journeys or claim compensation.'

'When we got to Finsbury Park it was absolutely, utter chaos, the staff were rude, and nobody had any information.'

Jane Hurn, 51, in central London

'Any civil engineering contractor would have realised probably weeks ago that they were going to overrun and they must have realised they would be fined...there are a lot of vulnerable people here.'

'It is dangerously overcrowded. In health and safety terms this must be well against the law. There is not an inch of room.'

'The overcrowding is horrendous. There is no way of getting any food or water. It is dreadful.'

For those whose trains were cancelled yesterday East Coast invited them to join services leaving King's Cross today. 

But with many of services sold out, passengers who previously held seats were forced to stand in the aisles and vestibules.

One family, which spent £500 on First Class tickets from Norwich to Edinburgh for a Christmas holiday, was forced to squeeze into the train's vestibule for the journey to Scotland after their train was cancelled. 

'The best advice we can give customers is to look online at our delay, repay service. Under the terms of that those delayed by more than two hours can claim a full refund. 

'We'll look sympathetically on them when processing refunds,' a spokesman told MailOnline. 

Meanwhile, angry passengers on board services into London Paddington have hit out at train operators after claiming they were packed into carriages 'like a sardine can'.

Gillian Mayer, 75, from East Ham in London slammed First Great Western calling its service 'diabolical' and has vowed never to make the same journey again.

She said: 'I'm absolutely fuming, the prices are astronomical and people buy the cheap tickets online beforehand but I don't have access to the internet. They've reserved the seats online so I have to go for whatever is left.

'It's absolutely diabolical. I was suppose to get the 12:42 from Newton Abbott in Devon but I got there early and asked the man what platform the train was on, and he said he didn't think a train was running at that time, so it didn't exist.

'Luckily the 12:29 was running late, so I managed to get on that. But if I hadn't turned up early for this other phantom train, I wouldn't have got on any train at all.

'It was packed, it was like a sardine can. I had a seat but I had somebody else's face four inches from mine.'

She added: 'I paid £57 for my ticket, because I have my discount card, but my son paid £87 because he doesn't have a card, and it goes up every year.

I do this journey every year, and each year it has been getting worse, I don't think I'm going to do that journey again, I think I'm going to find a different way from now on.'

Another rail passenger, who asked not to be named and refused to say where he had travelled from, said: 'I managed to get a seat but still the service you get for the price you pay is an absolute joke, it's really not worth it.

'I may have had a seat but it was still crammed on that train, it wasn't enjoyable that's for sure.' 

Services between Paddington and Reading were cancelled yesterday but resumed today, with delays expected.

First Great Western warned that delays of up to 15 minutes could be expected on some journeys between Paddington and Reading and Paddington and Hayes, until the end of service today, due to over-running engineering works.

Heathrow Connect services have also been cancelled by the company, which was unavailable for comment when contacted.

Network Rail yesterday apologised for the chaos on its website, with managing director Robin Gisby telling passengers: 'I'm deeply sorry for the delays, upset and upheaval caused today to passengers impacted by our overrunning improvement work outside King's Cross.' 

The company's chief executive Mark Carne did not answer when contacted at Hampshire home today. 

A Network Rail source told MailOnline that questions will be asked over why it was decided to divert hundreds of people to the significantly smaller Finsbury Park station. 

'Yesterday was an extraordinary situation and it put a huge amount of pressure on Finsbury Park with the closure of Kings Cross. 

'This will form part of the investigation, what initially went wrong at Kings Cross and also the contingency plan that was in place,' a spokesman for Network Rail said. 

Finsbury Park was forced to close yesterday after crowds flooded the station in a frantic bid to get home. 

Women and children were left crying on the station's platform with journeys to Peterborough, normally a 90minute trip, taking more than five hours.  

While East Coast passengers can use their tickets until tomorrow, critics said the company should refund passengers immediately for the hassle caused by delayed rail improvements.   

'This is not the time for private rail firms to hide behind the usual byzantine rules covering refunds.

'They will be paid millions for these delays by Network Rail and they must ensure that their frustrated passengers do not end up with just pennies after the horrendous delays of the past few days,' said Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the rail union TSSA. 

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin yesterday described the situation as 'totally unacceptable', 

'The situation on the railways this weekend has been totally unacceptable.

'Passengers must be able to trust that vital engineering works on the rail network will be completed on time. Passengers deserve no less.

'I will be asking Network Rail to set out what went wrong and how they can learn lessons, but its priority must be to get services running into King's Cross as well as Paddington.'

East Coast today said it would be 'sympathetic' to passengers claiming refunds for disruption yesterday. 

'We're hopeful everyone'll get to where they need to go today. We are carrying more people today as those who chose not to travel yesterday can use tickets today and tomorrow.
