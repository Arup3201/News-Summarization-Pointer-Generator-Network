One ton cake stand: Christopher Lawrence, 78, a silversmith from Essex was commissioned by the Sultan of Oman to handcraft the masterpiece

Flown by private plane from Essex to Oman, this £1 million cake stand was commissioned by the Sultan of Oman to give his tea times a touch of English elegance.

The 14ft-high solid silver masterpiece was made by Christopher Lawrence, 78, a silversmith from Westcliff, Essex.

He proudly made it for the Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said, 72, who has an estimated £470m fortune.

Master silversmith Mr Lawrence created the cake stand 14 years ago, but has only now revealed the story.

The lavish one ton cake stand still serves the Sultan's guests at his palace in the Gulf. 

Mr Lawrence explained: 'It was made in my workshop at home, and I then had to check that it all fitted together. So I erected it in the garden.

The neighbours didn't bat an eyelid.'

The cake stand was then transported to the Middle East in one of the sultan's two private planes. 

Mr Lawrence, who has just received a lifetime achievement award from Princess Michael of Kent, said: 'It needed 28 packing cases to contain it all.'

The cake stand was ordered by the Sultan, a keen anglophile, because he wanted to reproduce English style 
tea parties, with an Arabian touch.

Pride of place: The cake stand is likely to be at the Sultan's main residence, the Al Alam Palace in Muscat

Mr Lawrence explained: 'Cake is very 
central to their culture and notions of hospitality.

It goes back to the
days when guests to a sultan's tent were offered cakes baked in a hole 
in the ground.' 

The tradition has been modernised but the gesture remains the same.

On arrival, guests at one of the Sultan of Oman's receptions are offered a slice cut from a vast cake.

The Sultan has been a particular fan of Britain since his stint at military academy Sandhurst, Berkshire, to which he donated a sports pavilion as a sign of his happy time there. 

He served with the now defunct Cameronian regiment and spent six months learning about local British government in Suffolk County Council before returning home to Oman.

Sultan Qaboos seized power in a coup against his father, Said Bin Taimur, in 1970 and has ruled ever since. 

The Sultan's fortune derives from oil though recently he has invested much of it building up Oman's tourism industry.

Mr Lawrence said that he resisted any temptation to serve tea from the stand while it was still in his back garden: 'Somehow I don't think a Mr Kipling cake would have done this particular stand justice.'

Prince Charles and The Duchess of Cornwall as the Sultan's guests may well be having a slice from the cake stand from Essex on their visit later this month.
