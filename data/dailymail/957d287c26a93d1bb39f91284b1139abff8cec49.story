Ched Evans was seen smiling in public today as it emerged trolls said they leaked his rape victim's new identity  - two years after she was forced to take a new name and flee her home because of bullies.

The former Welsh international, 25, who was released from jail on Friday, was seen driven by his girlfriend Natasha Massey to her parents' home in Cheshire.

The woman he attacked, 22, had to start a new life away from her friends and family in north Wales after nine people were convicted of illegally naming her in 2012. 

Back on the streets: Ched Evans grinned as he headed out shopping with his long-standing girlfriend Natasha Massey

Evans with girlfriend Massey left jail on Friday after serving exactly half his five year prison sentence for rape

Evans was jailed in 2012 for raping a 19-year-old girl in a hotel room. He was convicted on the grounds that she had been too drunk to consent to sex

The young woman was named at least 6,000 times on Twitter alone following the conviction of Wales international Evans and was labelled a ‘slag’, ‘tramp’, ‘bitch’ and ‘whore’. 

Twitter trolls have continued to pursue her even though Evans was jailed for five years for raping her in a Rhyl hotel room.

According to the Daily Star a blogger has now said he has leaked her old name  and now her new name, including who she lives with. North Wales Police are yet to comment.

Another Twitter message, referring to her real name said: 'Her first name is: *****  Her second name is: *****  and she's a f****** liar'.

The attempts to expose her caused fury online with many calling for them to be prosecuted.

Victim: Ched Evans' victim's  new identity has apparently been published by trolls. She moved away from her friends and family, because of the abuse she suffered after being raped

Illegal naming carries a maximum fine of £5,000. 

Mollie Goodfellow  tweeted: 'Ched Evans' appeal gets fast-tracked, and his victim has to change her identity and move from her home? So much for justice.'‏

Police put the ‘relocation package’ together after her lifelong anonymity — protection afforded to anyone who has been subjected to a sexual assault — was breached on the internet. 

Some of the abuse amounted to ‘psychological GBH’, to use the description of one senior detective, which left the girl ‘traumatised’.

Hence the decision to give her a new identity, the first time, it is believed, a rape victim has been given such help in these circumstances.

The girl, now 22, had drunk two large glasses of wine along with four double vodkas and a sambuca on the night she was raped. 

But the jury agreed that she could not have consented to sex with Evans. 

In further pain for the victim it emerged yesterday that Evans, who was freed on Friday after serving half his five-year sentence, is to have a review of his conviction fast-tracked by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. 

It normally takes 18 months to examine a miscarriage of justice claim but Evans’ application will be considered ‘within weeks’ after fresh evidence was put forward by his legal team.

The Commission said its decision ‘does not in any way represent a judgment as to the merits of the case or its chances of being referred to the Court of Appeal’. 

The move has caused concern among rape campaigners. Rape Crisis England and Wales said: ‘We’re concerned that survivors’ voices and feelings [should] not be lost or overlooked in the furore surrounding one high-profile rapist’s release.’

Free: Evans is now out of prison having served half his sentence and his girlfriend Natasha Massey, 25 (right), has stood by him

Anger: Twitter uses have reacted to the news that Evans' victim may have been named again by trolls

Everyday Victim Blaming (EVB) said: ‘Rehabilitation requires remorse. Evans has continuously denied that he committed rape.’

Evans was jailed in 2012 for raping a 19-year-old girl in a hotel room. He was convicted on the grounds that she had been too drunk to consent to sex.

An appeal against Evans’s conviction was rejected by three judges at the court of appeal in 2012. 

On Friday Ched Evans was being whisked out of Wymott prison in a blacked-out Mercedes having served half of his sentence for rape.

This morning he is believed to be on the verge of signing a £500,000 contract with his old football club, Sheffield United.

The deal, worth up to £5,000-a-week, could see him back in training by next week, according to The Sun.

However, as a condition of the contract Evans - who still maintains he is innocent - must make a public apology. 

He has been left with little choice, as the club is the only one to have made him an offer, the paper claims.

In an interview in the Sunday Mirror, the former Sheffield United and Wales footballer – who hopes to resume his career – failed to apologise to his victim but praised his girlfriend Natasha Massey, 25, for standing by him.

‘I regret everything that happened and wish I could turn back the clock,’ he said.

‘I am very lucky my girlfriend Tasha has stood by me. She knows I am not capable of rape.

‘I want to play football again, but I am determined to prove my innocence.

‘I really thought it would have been thrown out of court. I was stunned when I was convicted. I had done nothing wrong.’

Some fans at Sheffield United are asking the club to re-sign Evans saying he has served his sentence and should be rehabilitated.

But more than 150,000 people have signed an online petition urging the Bramall Lane club not to welcome him back.

TV presenter Judy Finnigan sparked controversy last week by claiming his crime was ‘non violent’ and did not cause ‘bodily harm’ during a panel discussion on ITV’s Loose Women.

Her comments caused a wave of outrage and abuse on social media and also sparked threats against her daughter, fitness instructor Chloe, wishing rape on her.
