Cindy McCain had some choice words for Gwyneth Paltrow on Twitter Wednesday after the actress used a surprise  appearance at a tech conference to compare celebrities ridiculed on the internet to the plight of soldiers going through war.

Paltrow was outside Los Angeles at Re/Code's Code Conference speaking to Silicon Valley big wigs Tuesday when she made the offhanded remark that has former POW John McCain's wife, who's also mother to two soldiers, so livid.

'Gwyneth Paltrow is a joke,' McCain balked Wednesday night. 'Her life is like taking bullets for a soldier. What a joke! My 2 sons serving in the military should talk to her.'

A military mom's wrath: Cindy McCain, wife of ex-POW Senator John McCain and mother to two soldiers (left), has come out swinging over Gwyneth Paltrow's (right) suggestion that actors ridiculed on the internet are like soldiers at war

Not holding back: McCain's tweets came after Paltrow's comments while speaking at a tech conference. She's was surprisingly uncensored for a politician's wife

The row began with the following comment Paltrow made onstage while discussing internet comments about the stars:

'You come across them about yourself and about your friends, and it's a very dehumanizing thing. It's almost like how, in war, you go through this bloody, dehumanizing thing, and then something is defined out of it. My hope is, as we get out of it, we'll reach the next level of conscience,' she said.

It was a small part of what she said while sharing a stage with tech CEOs, but was more than enough to infuriate the war hero's wife.

Arizona Senator and former presidential hopeful John McCain was was taken as a prisoner of war as the third generation naval officer served as a pilot in Vietnam in 1967.

Senator McCain's plane was shot down by friendly fire and he would eventually spend five and a half years as an horifically abused prisoner before coming home to receive the Silver Star, Bronze Star, Purple Hear and Distinguished Flying Cross military honors.

Cindy McCain on Wednesday offered up a helpful suggestion to the Country Strong actress and self-styled lifestyle guru.

'Perhaps
 Gwyneth Paltrow should go out on patrol with some soldiers. Kind of 
like a Red Carpet in her mind I guess!' she tweeted.

While the Goop founder's appearance at the conference was a reaction to malevolent online attacks on her and her famous friends, any good it could have done has likely now been erased.

Which is nothing new for the recently single Paltrow.

A
 week before news of her 'conscious uncoupling' from husband Chris 
Martin broke, the 41-year-old infuriated working women across America 
when she said they had it easier than famous acting moms.

She had her reasons: John McCain, pictured here with Mrs. McCain at an Arizona Diamondbacks game this month, was an horrifically abused prisoner of war in Vietnam for five and a half years

'I think it's different when you have an office job, because it's routine and, you know, you can do all the stuff in the morning and then you come home in the evening,' she told E! 'I think to have a regular job and be a mom is not as, of course there are challenges, but it's not like being on set.'

Many women were put off by the comments, but none as famously as mother Mackenzie Dawson who made headlines with her open letter to Paltrow published in the New York Post on March 27.

'Thank God I don’t make millions filming one movie per year is what I say to myself pretty much every morning,' is one of many zingers in Dawson letter, which no doubt helped put the normally aloof Paltrow on the defensive.

On May 8th, she responded to the anger over her working mom comments with a Goop in which she drew a different sort of parallel with armed combat.

Co-parent: Gwyneth's estranged husband Chris Martin - who she recently separated with after 11 years of marriage - returned to Los Angeles on Thursday, where they still share a home together

In the post titled Ending the Mommy Wars, Paltrow wrote:

'Why do we feel so entitled to opine, often so negatively, on the choices of other women?

As the mommy wars rage on, I am constantly perplexed and amazed by how little slack we cut each other as women,' she wrote.

For her part, Cindy McCain used Thursday's whirlwind of publicity around her attack on Paltrow to help publicize a good cause.

'Happy
 to have joined @MikeGalanosHLN @HLNNowTV to chat about 
#humantrafficking and Gweneth Paltrow crazy statement,' McCain tweeted.

Spreading the word: McCain tweeted about Paltrow's comments repeatedly in what appeared to be her attempt to make sure the off-handed comment did not go unnoticed
