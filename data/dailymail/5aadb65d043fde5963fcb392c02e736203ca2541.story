Edward Davenport, AKA 'Fast Eddie',  was convicted of conspiracy to defraud and jailed for seven years and eight months. He is expected to pay back £12m of the estimated £40m he stole

A self-styled Lord who led the life of an international playboy while masterminding a huge loan swindle may have to repay just a fraction of his £40m   criminal empire, a court heard today.

Lord Edward Davenport, 47, has been released from prison after appeal court judges heard he is gravely ill following a kidney transplant.

The conman, born Edward Ormus Sharington Davenport, had been jailed for seven and a half years in 2011 but the Court of Appeal recently reduced the term as an 'act of mercy'.

Davenport once hosted lavish parties at his £10m mansion and boasted of befriending guests including supermodel Kate Moss and Princes William and Harry.

But the socialite, dubbed Fast Eddie, was exposed as a cynical fraudster who duped victims out of their life savings through bogus start-up loan   schemes.

He promised millions of pounds which never materialised after he had pocketed the administration fees and advance payments.

Princess Diana's wedding dress designer Elizabeth Emanuel was one who fell prey to Davenport's scheme, losing her life savings as a consequence.

Davenport and his lieutenants, Peter Riley and Borge Andersen were jailed in 2011 for the scam, which entrapped entrepreneurs from as far afield as   India, Canada and Dubai.

The fraudster was not at Southwark Crown Court today for the start of his confiscation hearing.  He may only have to pay back £12m - despite claims he may have made more than £40m through the six-year con.

Alex Chalk, prosecuting, said: 'There has been a lot of toing and froing - many, many hours have been spent on both sides seeking to narrow the gap.

'We took the view that it was in the public interest to arrive at the figure of £12m'. He said Davenport should also be forced to pay a further £1.9m in compensation to the 51 victims he swindled between 2003 and 2009.

But Andrew Campbell-Tiech, defending, said any compensation should be taken out of the £12m sum ahead of the civil action and heavy prosecution costs   Davenport faces.

'Anything Davenport has left over after £12m, anything left would first be the subject of prosecution costs and thereafter, there would be a plethora of   disappointed clients of the former Davenport empire and civil proceedings.

'A plethora of civil litigation swirls round his head'.

The court heard Davenport has since been the subject of litigation from HSBC for his criminal dealings, revealed in bank accounts, property, and profit   from his enterprises. He has also auctioned his mansion in plush Portland Place in central London, which he bought from the Sierra Leone government for just £2m.

Davenport enticed his victims who a website boasting of his champagne and sports-car lifestyle and a £100m property portfolio in Britain, Thailand and   Monaco.

He even lent his 110 room west London mansion for an Agent Provocateur advert featuring Kate Moss, and for scenes in the Oscar-winning movie The King's   Speech.

The court heard that there is still disagreement on Davenport's remaining assets, with the defence estimating the figure at £13.4m and the prosecution   putting it at just over £14m.

Mr Chalk said the defence only decided to bring down their figure on Tuesday after they commissioned a new survey on one of Davenport's properties,   valuing it £635,000 below its previous estimate.

The two sides had been in agreement over a £14m figure since June last year. Davenport's defence team had previously argued that he should repay as little as £8m, and that his mansion on Portland Place should not be part of   proceedings.

Judge Peter Testar said: 'This can't go on. It's three years since the conviction and there have been all sorts of difficulties along the way'.

Davenport claimed to be a familiar face in 'exclusive venues across the world' and had 'extensive business interests.'

His web page boasted: 'Welcome to the website of Edward Davenport, one of London's most flamboyant and best known entrepreneurs as well as a true   English gentleman from an established British family.'

Among the stars Davenport was pictured with on the site's gallery were actors Hugh Grant, Jeremy Irons, Jude Law and Steve Coogan; music mogul Simon   Cowell; rapper 50 Cent, with whom the defendant is shown comparing watches, designers Vivienne Westwood and Jimmy Choo; New Labour spin doctor Alastair   Campbell and current Lord Chancellor Ken Clarke; Rolling Stones Mick Jagger and Ronnie Wood and other celebrities such as Jordan, Anna Kournikova,   Jean-Claude Van-Damme and Ozzie Osbourne.

One of his victims, Miss Emanuel, agreed to surrender 65 per cent of her company in return for a £1.5million investment, but Davenport demanded £20,000   in up-front fees.

She told his trial: 'He knew I was at rock bottom and he wanted to screw me out of every penny.

'It was unbelievable that he had made all these contacts and bought a title to give him credibility when he was just a common con man. He fully deserves   his sentence.'

Judge Telstar ruled that Davenport's assets stand at £13.9m and that £12m would be confiscated under the Proceeds of Crime Act.

A further ruling on whether Davenport should pay a further £1.9m in compensation to his victims will be made tomorrow.

'I'm not going to make this decision today so I'm going to have to reserve my decision until later,' said Telstar.

'I make the finding, with agreement with both parties and with absolute and entire assurance from those taking instruction, that the benefit to these   crimes was £12m, which will be confiscated.

'I make the further finding that the available sum of assets is £13,943,000'.

The court heard that the £12m confiscation order against Davenport would mean his victims may not receive any compensation if they won claims against   him in the High Court.

Judge Telstar added: 'When I make my full ruling on whether the defendant should pay a further £1.9m I will examine at whether I can insert a clause so   that victims who win civil litigation against him can have monies from the £12m sum diverted to them'.

Davenport, formerly of Portland Place, central London, was convicted after a trial of conspiracy to defraud. The hearing continues.
