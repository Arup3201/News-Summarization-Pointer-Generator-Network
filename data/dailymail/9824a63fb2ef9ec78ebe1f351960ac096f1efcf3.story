Karim Benzema has committed his future to Real Madrid by signing a contract extension until 2019 after snubbing advances from Premier League clubs.

Speculation regarding the France forward's future in the Spanish capital had been rife in recent weeks, but he will remain at the Bernabeu until 2019.

Arsenal, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur were among the Premier League sides linked to the 26-year-old this summer but the former Lyon man will not be plying his trade in England next season.

He has also won La Liga once, the Copa del Rey twice and the Supercopa Espana once during his time in Spain.
