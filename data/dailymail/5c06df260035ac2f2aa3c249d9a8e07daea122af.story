Oprah Winfrey is hoping her hotly anticipated confessional interview with Lance Armstrong will boost the lackluster ratings of her network, OWN.

With the interview now spread over two nights and not one as originally planned, OWN is selling advertising space at premium prices and expects record viewing figures.

Launched in 2011 to poor ratings, this interview marks a step up in Winfrey becoming more involved in programing such as the Armstrong interview which appears on her weekly 'Oprah's Next Chapter'.

It has been reported that Oprah Winfrey is hoping the success of her interview with Lance Armstrong will lead to a rise in ratings at her OWN network

The network, a joint venture with Discovery Communications Inc, expects to sell all of the remaining commercial time for the two-part version of 'Oprah's Next Chapter,' OWN President Erik Logan said in an interview late on Tuesday.

Both current and new sponsors have been calling to secure ad time during the telecast, which airs in primetime on Thursday and Friday, said Logan.

'We are seeing a great demand in the marketplace,' he said.

Winfrey confirmed on Tuesday that Armstrong, who she interviewed on Monday, admitted to using banned performance-enhancing drugs during his professional cycling career that included seven Tour de France titles. The cyclist had vehemently denied doping for more than a decade.

OWN planned to air one episode with Armstrong but expanded the program to two nights after the cyclist talked with Winfrey for more than two hours.

The interview is generating a wave of publicity for OWN, the network Winfrey launched in 2011 to lackluster ratings. OWN's audience has grown in recent months after Winfrey became more involved in programming.

Confession: Lance Armstrong admitted to doping in an interview with Oprah Winfrey this week, the chat show queen confirmed

In 2012, OWN's primetime ratings rose 32 percent over the previous year among its target audience of women aged 25 to 54, according to data from the network.

OWN averaged 147,000 viewers aged 25 to 54 during primetime in 2012, according to Nielsen data provided by Horizon Media.

A chunk of ad time for the Armstrong interview was pre-sold to regular advertisers of 'Oprah's Next Chapter,' a weekly show where she sits down with big-name stars and newsmakers such as reality TV's Kardashian family and rapper Usher.

The remaining commercial time is being sold in the final days leading up to the telecasts in the 'scatter' market, which commands higher prices than the pre-sold rates.

Thanks to growing interest in Armstrong's comments, OWN is securing a premium over the usual scatter rates for 'Oprah's Next Chapter,' Logan said.

'We are seeing the premiums' on ad rates, he said, but declined to provide specific figures.

The network is giving priority to advertisers who have bought time on the show in the past and those that will also commit to other shows, he said.

Ongoing OWN sponsors include General Motors Co, Target Corp, and Kellogg Co .

OWN scored some of its biggest audiences with Winfrey's celebrity interviews.

Her March 2012 talk with Whitney Houston's daughter shortly after the singer's sudden death drew 3.5 million viewers. Singer Rihanna's appearance in August 2011 grabbed 2.5 million viewers.

Winfrey, in an appearance on 'CBS This Morning,' said Armstrong 'didn't come clean in the manner that I expected.'

'I think the most important questions and the answers that people around the world have been waiting to hear were answered,' she said.

The Armstrong interview will generate high ratings and help build buzz for the network, said David Johnson, CEO of public relations firm Strategic Vision. Customers in Atlanta, where he is based, have been contacting their cable operator to ask if they carry the network, he said.

'People will be talking about it,' Johnson said. 'It will raise public awareness and create public curiosity about the network, even if it's a one-time deal.'

After more than a decade of denying 
doping claims, disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong has admitted to Oprah 
that he used performance-enhancing drugs to help him win seven Tour de 
France titles, sources revealed Monday evening.

A
person familiar with the situation told the Associated Press that 
Armstrong confessed to Oprah Winfrey during an interview taping with the
Queen of Talk, which is slated to air on Thursday on her network.

Lance Armstrong's sits down interview on Oprah Winfrey's Next Chapter show. Winfrey interviewed cyclist and former Tour de France champ Armstrong at a hotel in Austin, Texas earlier this week

Armstrong
was stripped of all seven Tour titles last year in the wake of a 
voluminous U.S. Anti-Doping Agency report that portrayed him as a 
ruthless competitor, willing to go to any lengths to win the prestigious
race.

A group of about 10 close friends and
advisers to Armstrong left a downtown Austin hotel about three hours 
after they arrived Monday afternoon for the taping.

Among them were 
Armstrong attorneys Tim Herman and Sean Breen, along with Bill 
Stapleton, Armstrong's longtime agent, manager and business partner.

All
declined comment entering and exiting the session.

Soon afterward, Winfrey tweeted: 
'Just wrapped with (at)lancearmstrong More than 2 1/2 hours. He came 
READY!'

Lance Armstrong's interview with Oprah is the most eagerly anticipated event for her fledgling OWN network

She was scheduled to appear on 'CBS This Morning' on Tuesday to 
discuss the interview.

In a text to the AP on Saturday, 
Armstrong said: 'I told her (Winfrey) to go wherever she wants and I'll 
answer the questions directly, honestly and candidly. That's all I can 
say.'

Armstrong stopped at the Livestrong 
Foundation, which he founded, on his way to the interview and said, 'I'm
sorry' to staff members, some of whom broke down in tears.

A person 
with knowledge of that session said Armstrong choked up and several 
employees cried during the session.

The person also said Armstrong 
apologized for letting the staff down and putting Livestrong at risk but
he did not make a direct confession to using banned drugs.

He said he would try to restore the 
foundation's reputation, and urged the group to continue fighting for 
the charity's mission of helping cancer patients and their families.

Rae Bazzarre, a spokeswoman for Livestrong said it was emotional 'but we were all glad to see him.'

Armstrong
had not been at the headquarters since October 21, Ms Bazzarre said, 
about two weeks before he resigned from Livestrongâ€™s board of directors.

USADA chief executive Travis Tygart 
labeled the doping regimen allegedly carried out by the U.S. Postal 
Service team that Armstrong once led, 'The most sophisticated, 
professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever 
seen.'
