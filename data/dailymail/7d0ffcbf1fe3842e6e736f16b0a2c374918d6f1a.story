It is a familiar plight for Scrabble fanatics – being stuck with the letter Q without a U to go with it.

But now 5,000 new words have been added to The Official Scrabble Players Dictionary – including qajaq.

Lexicographer Peter Sokolowski, who helped compile the updated fifth edition, said the word is an alternative spelling for kayak reflecting its Inuit roots.

You would, however, need one of the blank tiles which can be used for any letter as Scrabble sets include only one Q.

For really competitive Scrabblers 
there is also quinzhee, a shelter made by hollowing out a pile of snow, 
for which you can rack up 401 points if you play your tiles right.

It would involve ending at the top 
right corner using two triple word squares and a double letter square, 
plus an existing letter and all seven of your own tiles which gives a 50
 point bonus.

Other new entries to the dictionary, 
which already lists more than 100,000 words, include beatbox, bromance 
(friendship between two men), chillax, frenemy (combination of friend 
and enemy), hashtag, mojito, selfie, sudoku and texter.

But it's
 the addition of the word ‘te’ as a variant of 'ti'  and three other 
two-letter words - da, gi and po - that has Toronto clinical 
psychologist Robin Pollock Daniel excited.

He is a champion of the North American Scrabble Players Association, which has a committee that helps Merriam-Webster track down new, playable words of two to eight letters.

Mr Daniel said: 'Being able to hook an “e” underneath "t" means that I can play far more words. Sometimes you play parallel to a word and you're making two-letter words along the way.

‘I call those the amino acids of Scrabble. The more two-letter words we have, the more possibilities a word will fit.'

The new words add about 40 pages to the Scrabble-sanctioned dictionary, which already lists more than 100,000 playable words.

Definitions are kept to a minimum but parts of speech and whether a plural is available are noted.

To be included in the 36-year-old book —
 this is the fifth edition — a word must be found in a standard 
dictionary, can't require capitalization, can't have hyphens or 
apostrophes and can't be an abbreviation.

This is in 
addition to being two to eight letters, reflecting the seven tiles 
players draw plus an eighth already on the board they can attach a long 
word to for bonus points.

Among the highest potential scorers among the new additions is 'quinzhee,' a shelter made by hollowing out a pile of snow.

Played
 on the board's top row, ending at the top right through an existing 
‘u’, and a player can score 401 points, including the 50-point ‘bingo’ 
bonus for using all seven tiles.

Merriam-Webster
 did not identify all 5,000 new words but released a list of about 30 
that also include: Beatbox, buzzkill, chillax, coqui, frenemy, funplex, 
jockdom, joypad, mixtape, mojito, ponzu, qigong, schmutz, sudoku and 
yuzu.

Geocache was also added, voted into the dictionary by the public during a Facebook contest in May.
