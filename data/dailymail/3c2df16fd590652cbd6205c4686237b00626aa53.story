World record: Bolt produced more than 2,600 watts of power to hit his 100m time of 9.58 seconds

Olympic champion Usain Bolt produced 50 times more energy than that of a speeding bullet during one of his record-breaking 100metre runs, scientists have revealed.

Physicists studying the secrets of Bolt's success announced the findings after a detailed study of the Jamaican sprinter's 100m performance during the 2009 World Championships in Berlin.

They discovered that he produced a remarkable 81.58kJ of energy - compared to just 1.6kJ of energy a bullet produces when it leaves the 
barrel of a 0.44 calibre Magnum handgun.

They also calculated that he reached a top speed of 27mph during the race.

But unlike a bullet - which can reach 
1,000mph - Bolt's huge 6ft 5ins frame meant more than 92 per cent of his 
energy was absorbed in battling air resistance.

The researchers found he
 had to produce an 'extraordinary' amount of power to reach his 100m 
world record time - and because he's so tall he is less aerodynamic than the average human.

They made the discovery after taking into account the altitude of 
the Berlin track, the temperature at the time of the race and the 
cross-section of Bolt himself.

Bolt reached a maximum power of 2,619.5watts - a 
horsepower of 3.5 - within 0.89 seconds when he was only at half his maximum speed, which shows the effect the drag had on his acceleration.

Jorge Hernandez, co-author of the study which was published in the European Journal of Physics, said: 'Our calculated drag coefficient highlights the outstanding ability of Bolt.

'He
 has been able to break several records despite not being as aerodynamic
 as a human can be. The enormous amount of work that Bolt developed in 
2009, and the amount that was absorbed by drag, is truly extraordinary.

'It
 is so hard to break records nowadays, even by hundredths of a second, 
as the runners must act very powerfully against a tremendous force which
 increases massively with each bit of additional speed they are able to 
develop.

Fastest: Bolt, pictured at London 2012, had to exert an 'extraordinary' amount of power to make the time because his large frame makes his less aerodynamic

'This is all because of the 'physical barrier' imposed 
by the conditions on Earth. Of course, if Bolt were to run on a planet 
with a much less dense atmosphere, he could achieve records of fantastic
 proportions.'

The researchers, from the National Autonomous University of Mexico, claim their equations can be used to calculate the effect of a tailwind, which can vary between races and significantly reduce running times.

They compared Bolt's time in Berlin with his 
previous world record time of 9.69 seconds, set during the Beijing 
Olympics a year earlier.Â 

In Beijing Bolt was running with no tailwind, but in Berlin there was a tailwind of 0.9 metres per second.

According
 to the researchers' new equations, Bolt would have clocked a slower 
time in Berlin if there was no tailwind, but would still have beaten his
 world record from Beijing - they predict that he would have run a time 
of 9.68 seconds.

Resistance: Bolt developed more than 80kJ of energy but more than 92 per cent of it was absorbed by the drag

The calculations in the study were tested for accuracy by fitting real-life experimental data into the equations.

The figures were from the 
International Association of Athletics Federation's (IAAF) laser 
velocity guard device, which recorded Bolt's position and speed every 
one-tenth of a second during the 2009 race in Berlin.

Dr 
Hernandez added: 'The accurate recording of Bolt's position and speed 
during the race provided a splendid opportunity for us to study the 
effects of drag on a sprinter.

'If more data become available in the future, it would be interesting to see what distinguishes one athlete from another.'

Usain Bolt is in London at the Olympic park today to take part in a anniversary games to mark a year since London 2012.
