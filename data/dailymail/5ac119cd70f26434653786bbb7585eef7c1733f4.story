When it comes to a wedding proposal, the element of surprise is crucial.

From concealed within a slice of cake to resting in the bottom of a champagne flute, many men go to great lengths to come up with the perfect place to hide the engagement ring.

But technology director Jason Muscat may be the first would-be groom to chopper the diamond in on a remote control helicopter.

Secure: Mr Muscat went through a 'dry run' with the photographer before popping the question with a ring strapped onto the helicopter

Mr Muscat spent months brainstorming before settling on the perfect way to surprise his pregnant girlfriend Christina Dam, according to a report on Petapixel.com.

And the couple can relive every moment of the romantic proposal in San Francisco's Alamo Sqaure Park, thanks to a video camera strapped to the remote control chopper.

The technology director and photography buff told his girlfriend he wanted to take some pictures of her in the park.

As she was posing for his photographs, wedding photographer Chris Geiger was piloting a remote control helicopter with the ring tightly strapped on.

Memories: Jason Muscat managed to capture his girlfriend's reaction on camera as he popped the question

Unbeknownst to his girlfriend, Mr Muscat was using his 5D Mark II camera to film her reaction rather than take photos.

The groom-to-be had also set up a second camera in the park to capture the scene, in addition to two cameras attached to the helicopter.

The resulting video captures Christina's delighted acceptance from all angles.

Mr Muscat said afterwards that his proposal 'came off perfectly', and that the couple now have 'a great memory to look back on for the rest of our lives'.
