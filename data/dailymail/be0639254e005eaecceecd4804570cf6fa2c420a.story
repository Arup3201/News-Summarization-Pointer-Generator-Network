Renowned Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei has chosen the unlikely setting of a 'sort of field in Yorkshire' for his next exhibition.  

The anti-government icon is banned from leaving China, but has allowed a selection of his works to be sent to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park near Wakefield.  

Among the pieces set to go on display are a number which allude to the artist's detention in virtual house arrest, where he is monitored around the clock by the Communist Party authorities. 

Exhibition: Ai Weiwei's Iron Tree will be featured in an exhibition at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park

Star: The Chinese artist rose to fame in Britain thanks to his 'Sunflower Seeds' exhibition at the Tate Modern

The Yorkshire Sculpture Park uses the grounds of a country estate to showcase monumental works in a rural setting - not a natural environment for subversive Chinese art.  

But when curators wrote to Mr Ai suggesting that he should lend his sculptures to the park, he enthusiastically agreed. 

The centrepiece of the exhibition will be a selection from his work Fairytale - 1001 Chairs, an arrangement of furniture from the Qing dynasty, which is meant to highlight how difficult it is for Chinese citizens to leave their country.

The chairs will be set up in the park's 18th-century chapel, in an arrangement requested by Mr Ai himself, allowing visitors to sit and meditate on those who have used both the chairs and the chapel before them.

He has also lent a brightly coloured ceramic re-creation of a 'ruyi', traditionally seen as conferring authority on whoever possesses it. 

Venue: The exhibition will take place in this 18th-century chapel in the grounds of the park near Wakefield

Antiques: These Qing dynasty chairs form another artwork which Mr Ai has lent to the exhibition

The 
artist's 20ft-tall Iron Tree will be set up in the chapel's courtyard, 
while ceramic lanterns which allude to the lightshades Mr Ai has hung 
from the surveillance cameras surrounding his home will be on display 
inside.

A
 series of readings from the works of the artist's father Ai Qing, a 
dissident poet, will be performed in the chapel during the exhibition, 
which opens on May 24.

Curator Clare Lilley said that the park did not expect Mr Ai to be so keen to work with them.  

'There
 has to be a really important reason why an artist would want to do 
something in a sort of field in Yorkshire,' she told The Times.

'We
 are incredibly surprised, really grateful that he has been able to give
 this any time at all, we know the difficulties he has.'

Controversy: Mr Ai pictured tussling with police outside his home in Beijing where he is under virtual house arrest

Protest: Pro-democracy advocates holding posters of Ai Weiwei during a demonstration in Hong Kong

Mr Ai, 56, rose to celebrity in Britain after he was commissioned by the Tate Modern to fill the buildings turbine hall with 1million hand-painted porcelain 'sunflower seeds' in 2010.  

He is now one of China's best-known artists, having helped to design the 'Bird's Nest' stadium which hosted the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.  

However, he has had his passport confiscated by the authorities after repeatedly speaking out against the regime's human rights record.  

In 2011, he was arrested and imprisoned over claims he had evaded tax, in a case widely condemned by the international community.
