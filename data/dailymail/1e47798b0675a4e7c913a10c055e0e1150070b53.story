It's been a good week for Samir Nasri...

First, he scored a vital goal for Manchester City in the Champions League against Roma as they progressed to the last 16. Now, the midfielder appears to have won the lot at Winter Wonderland.

The prizes just keep coming for Nasri who took to Instagram to brag about his latest win with girlfriend Anara Atanes.

Posing with Atanes as he went to 'Winter Wonderland with my baby', Nasri then posed with friends and the teddies they'd won as they cleaned up at the festive carnival.

Come Saturday, though, he'll be looking for a different prize. Nasri and Co are set to take on Crystal Palace at the Etihad in their final game before Christmas.

They'll hope to close their three-point gap between them and Chelsea, who face Stoke away.
