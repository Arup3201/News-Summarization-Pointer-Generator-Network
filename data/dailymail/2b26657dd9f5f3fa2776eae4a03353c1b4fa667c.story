Britain and its Nato allies have been warned to beef up their defence spending after a ‘black year’ of aggression from Russia and Islamic terrorism.

Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that the security environment for the Western allies had ‘fundamentally changed’ and required the alliance to ‘change our defence posture’.

He said the biggest challenge comes from Russia, which has annexed Crimea and is trying to destabilise eastern Ukraine, but is also planning a vast programme of rearmament over the next five years.

Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu declared yesterday that despite the country’s economic woes, he would go ahead with a £190billion programme to fully modernise the armed forces by 2020.

He ominously warned that this would prevent any other country having ‘military superiority over Russia’. They plan for 70 to 100pc of Russia’s weapons and equipment to be modernised by 2020.

Tensions between Russia and the West have risen over the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where the United States and Europe say Moscow is fuelling an insurgency by sending in troops and weapons.

Mr Stoltenberg said in Brussels yesterday: ‘2014 was not a good year for European security. In fact it was a black year. Our security environment has fundamentally changed’.

He also highlighted the threat posed by Islamic State terrorists and other groups such as those who killed 17 people in attacks on the office of Charlie Hebdo magazine and a Jewish grocery store in Paris this month. ‘To the south, violent extremism is at our borders. Spreading turmoil across North Africa and the Middle East and fuelling terrorism on our own streets’, he said.

But he warned Russia’s increased defence capabilities including the ability to launch snap military exercises on a huge scale were ‘part of the reason we have decided to change our defence posture’.

The secretary-general, a former prime minister of Norway, said: ‘We have seen that Russia is ready to use force’, citing their intimidation of people in Ukraine, and Georgia and Moldova.

The chief of Russia’s General Staff said yesterday that the military would receive 50 intercontinental ballistic missiles this year, with strategic nuclear forces a top priority as they can penetrate NATO’s U.S.-led missile defence system.

Mr Shoigu said yesterday: ‘We plan to fulfil the government armament programme and reach by 2020 the intended quantities of modern weapons systems.’ He claimed this was in response to ‘western countries actively using new forms of aggression, combining military as well as non-military means.’

Mr Stoltenberg warned that as Russia has continued to build up its military, Nato countries in Europe were cutting their budgets, when they should be increasing.

‘It is not possible to get more out of less indefinitely’, he said. ‘That is the reason why we have to stop the cuts and gradually start to increase defence spending as our economies grow.

‘Despite the economic crisis, despite the financial problems they are facing, Russia now is still giving priority to defence spending.’

David Cameron has failed to guarantee defence spending would remain at 2 per cent of GDP if he wins a second term and there is pressure to make further cuts to public spending.

But defence secretary Michael Fallon has said Britain is currently spending at this level and will continue to do until the end of this Parliament.

Nato’s rapid reaction force, made up of land, sea, air and special operations units, is already on 7-day standby in case of an imminent threat from Russia.

But Mr Stoltenberg said the 28-member organisation would also deploy a ‘spearhead force’ of smaller units in six Eastern European nations for the first time.

The make-up of the force numbering several dozen, to be stationed in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Bulgaria and Romania, will be discussed by Nato defence ministers when they meet next week.

Last year amid rising tension, Nato forces conducted about 200 military exercises, and Stoltenberg said this would continue as the alliance adapts to the increased presence of Russian warplanes in European skies. NATO intercepted more than 400 Russian aircraft last year.

RAF jets were scrambled more than 100 times last year to escort Russian bombers away from British airspace. And in most audacious incursion yet, two long-range bombers flew over Bournemouth this week and caused disruption to civilian flights, causing Moscow’s ambassador had to be summoned to the Foreign Office to account for the incident, which Russia claims was a routine patrol.
