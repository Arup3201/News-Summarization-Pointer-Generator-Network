A three-foot sturgeon which escaped from an aquatic centre during the flooding has been found four weeks later - in a puddle at a car wash one mile away.

The fish, named Steve, went missing from Romsey World of Water in Hampshire after the nearby River Test burst its banks last month.

He was swept away by three feet of water, before swimming across a main road, fields and a petrol station forecourt.

Found: This sturgeon, named Steve, escaped from Romsey World of Water in Hampshire during the flooding

Scene: Now, four weeks later, Steve has been discovered in a puddle at this car wash (pictured) - a staggering one mile away from the aquatic centre. But despite his plight, the fish has been safely returned to the centre

Now, four weeks later, he has been discovered in a puddle at a car wash - a staggering one mile away from the aquatic centre.

But despite his plight, Steve has been safely returned to the centre - and is making good progress.

General manager, Mark Bradbury, said: 'We have a lot of display gardens and big ponds outside the centre, featuring fish that are not for sale.

'Steve lives in one of those ponds and he escaped, along with his friend - a large koi carp fish named Chadwick - when we were flooded.

Journey: During his one-mile trip, Steve swam across a main road, flooded fields and a petrol station forecourt

Pleased: Mark Bradbury, general manager of the aquatic centre, said staff at the car wash had been shocked by Steve. 'The staff were a bit taken aback because sturgeons look quite shark-like,' said Mr Bradbury

'As the weeks passed, eventually the water began to subside, and then we got a call from staff at a car wash about one mile away.

'They said they thought they’d found one of our fish in a puddle and they were a bit taken aback because sturgeons look quite shark-like.

'But sure enough, there he was alive and well. He’d been living in the deep puddle at the car wash.'

Mr Bradbury said that Steve had been 'a bit worse for wear' with several 'bumps and scratches' when he was found.

Path: The three-foot sturgeon swam down this main road at some point during his journey to the car wash

Another sight: He also made his way across this petrol station forecourt, before ending up in a puddle at the car wash. The fish was later discovered in 'a bit worse for wear' state, sporting several bumps and scratches'

'We couldn’t believe he had got so far, because his route would have included travelling across fields, a main road and around the petrol station,' he said. 

'We don’t know if he went through the car wash, but medics say he is making a good recovery back with his friends at the centre. He has had an incredible adventure, but I think he’s glad to be back home.'

But while Steve has been reunited with the aquatic centre, Chadwick has not yet been so lucky.

Not so lucky: While Steve has been reunited with the aquatic centre (pictured today), Chadwick is still missing

The 15-year-old koi carp - which is also three-foot long and weighs about 25 pounds - is still missing.

'We are delighted that Steve is back with us, but we are still really keen to find Chad,' said Mr Bradbury.

'They are both pond or lake fish, so Chad will have headed for flooded fields and places like that.

'He is a very big fish, so we hope that someone will spot him and that we can reunite him with Steve at the centre soon.'
