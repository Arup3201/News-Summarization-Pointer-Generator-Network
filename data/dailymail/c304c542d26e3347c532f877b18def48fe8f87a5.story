As suburban populations increase in places like Chicago, there is no space left for coyotes to live and roam for their prey.

Therefore almost 2,000 have ventured into a new habitat - among the skyscrapers of downtown Windy City.

The animals have adapted to living in close quarters with humans and have learned to navigate tasks associated with built-up areas - such as crossing busy roads and avoiding cars.

Over the past few years they have spread to nearly every corner of the United States - wreaking havoc by preying on domestic pets and even attacking children. 

But the suburban sprawl and increase in out-of-town developments have prompted some to migrate to more urban areas.

Urban crawlers: A Crittercam used as part of a study by Ohio State University shows a pair of coyotes trying to cross a road in downtown Chicago 

Lifestyle: The project, which has seen 850 of the creatures tagged with GPS and 400 with radio collars, has found them to be strictly nocturnal, but during the day they sleep yards away from where humans walk 

They are strictly nocturnal, curling up in a ball during the day just yards from where people walk, and are able to defend large settlement areas.  

Stan Gehrt, a wildlife ecologist at Ohio State University in Columbus, told National Geographic that the versatile creatures are 'expanding their ecological envelope'.

'We felt there were parts of Chicago too urban, with too many people, for coyotes to live—and we were wrong,' he said. 'They're a humbling animal'. 

Gerht, who has been tracking urban coyotes in Chicago since 2000, tagged 850 coyotes with GPS devices and placed radio collars on about 400.

During the course of the project they have found that coyotes thrive in urban populations - living longer than their rural cousins and being more active at night. 

Crittercams attached to the animals show them stopping and waiting for cars, rushing between streets and following their mates.  

Because of access to a wider range of resources - such as discarded food - they are able to produce larger litters of puppies, with an average of up to nine per pack.

One GPS-collared coyote named 748 and his mate were able to raise a litter of five pups inside a secret concrete den in the parking lot of Soldier Field Stadium, home of the Chicago Bears.

The survey is run by the Urban coyote ecology and management based in Illinois. Their website reads: 'Originally known as ghosts of the plains, coyotes have now become ghosts of the cities, occasionally heard but less often seen. 

'With the exception of a few individuals, coyotes have largely learned to avoid us.'

The movement of the carnivores into the city was embraced in 2011, when officials used one to help rid the streets of rats. 

Some locals were surprised at the move because attacks on humans are rare, but not unknown, however the results were limited.

They more frequently target pets, prompting some communities around the country to take action to stop them. 

Residents of a Rhode Island town have enlisted a hired gun to rid the town of coyotes, responsible for several recent attacks on pets. 

In September officials in a Southern California suburb beset by a surge in coyote attacks on pets, including a small dog snatched from its owner's living room, approved a plan to trap and kill some of the wild canines roaming the town.

The City Council of Seal Beach, a seaside community of about 25,000 residents south of Los Angeles, took the action this week following an uproar over a rise in coyotes venturing into neighborhoods to prey on dogs and cats.

Earlier this year, an extreme, hybrid form of the carnivore was spotted in West Virginia and land north of the Great Lakes.

The 'coywolf' - created after wolves and Eastern coyotes mated - were forced to live in built-up areas because of the increase in population.

The wolf genes allow the coyote to take down bigger prey, while the coyote genes allow them to adapt to cities.  

Location: Suburban sprawl has meant that downtown and built-up areas are one of the only places coyotes can set up their habitats 

Strong: In comparison to their rural cousins, urban coyotes live longer and can develop larger families

Suburban sprawl means downtown areas are one of their last options
