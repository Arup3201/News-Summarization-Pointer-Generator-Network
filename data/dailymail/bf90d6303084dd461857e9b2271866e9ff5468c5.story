The Duke university student who outed the freshman who pays her tuition by starring in porn films as 'Belle Knox'  is facing an online backlash.

Thomas Bagley, a Phi Delta Theta pledge who is majoring in computer science and mathematics, recognized Knox after watching her performance on an X-rated website.

However, Bagley has not emerged from the saga unscathed, with his predilection for hardcore pornography trumpeted far and wide and his decision to out Knox gaining him almost as many detractors as the teen pornstar.

Secret sharer: Thomas Bagley says he regrets the decision to out Belle Knox to his fraternity brothers

Joy: Knox previously said that her experience in porn has brought her 'unimaginable joy'

One such person is Mike Kulich, the 
head of Monarchy Distribution, a pornography distribution company.

'[If] he can shame girls for doing porn, I can shame him for watching it,' he said recently, reports The Daily Dot.

Kulich,
 whose work includes such award-winning films as 'Asses for the Masses' 
and 'Cray Cray Vajayjay,' has made a habit of offering big bucks to 
controversial figures, including accused murderer Amanda Knox and shamed
 former PR exec Justine Sacco, whose racist tweet saw her fired from her
 job.

In an open letter to 
Bagley, Kulich thanked him for being such a fan of the porn industry, 
estimating that he must spend $200 a week to subscribe to the site.

'I'm sure your parents are proud,' he writes, before suggesting Bagley gets good grades when he is not masturbating.

Kulich then offers Bagley $10,000 'to live out (his) fantasies.'

'We will make you a celebrity because it is apparent how much you love porn and attention,' he writes.

Empowered: Belle Knox has been doing the rounds of cable news shows and writing op-eds about porn and feminism

Financial burden: Knox says she first starting working in the adult film industry to pay her $47,000 in tuition

Bagley has disabled his Twitter account following the Belle Knox controversy. He told the Duke Chronicle that he now regrets his actions.

'She told me that I ruined her life,' Bagley said.  'I certainly would take it back.  I would take pretty much that whole night back.'

And while he is getting a taste of his own medicine, Knox has become something of a media darling, appearing on cable news shows and penning op-eds on the porn industry.

Disengaged: Bagley has disabled his Twitter account after the media storm that came when he outed Belle Knox

On Thursday night she told CNN's Piers Morgan that she hasn't let the abuse and harassment she received after Bagley blew her cover get to her.

'I think 80 per cent of the world’s traffic on the Internet is pornography,' she said. 'And I think that probably every single person at some point in their life has watched pornography.

'So, I think it’s extremely hypocritical that the same society that consumes me is also condemning me.'

Knox made headlines last month when Bagley spilled her secret at a fraternity event.

After that the news spread like wildfire on the North Carolina campus and Knox says it got to the point where she felt unsafe, so the university let her take a few days off classes.

On her side: Knox says she's faced some hostility on campus - mostly from other girls - but that most people have been supportive

'They've been very supportive of me. We're working really hard to make sure that I'm safe ,' she said.

In
 her CNN interview, Knox went into more detail about how she got into 
the porn industry, while also voicing some of her regrets.

She
 says she decided to start starring in adult films when she received her
 financial aid package for Duke and found out she was going to need to 
pay about $47,000 a year.

'The
 financial aid that I was given to pay for my tuition was insufficient 
and just really an enormous financial burden on my family,' she said.

Knox, who has two other siblings, decided to start shooting adult films since the pay was good and didn't require a huge time commitment. 

'I set my own schedule,' she said, adding that she makes $1,200 a scene. 'I don't have to worry about not getting sleep or not doing my work because I'm working three jobs.'

But she also says she hid her part-time job from her parents, which is something she now regrets.

'I regret not telling my family from the get-go. I think that was a really big mistake,' Knox said.

Knox wouldn't go into detail about how her family has reacted to the news, but says she's not worried her porn work will come between them.

'My family loved me six months ago when I wasn't a porn star, so I don't know what would make them not love me now,' she said.

Knox even went so far as to say that if her own future daughter wanted to go into porn, she would support her.

'I would want my daughter to make an informed decision about her career and I think it's absolutely her choice,' she said.

But Knox admits that the news of her porn career has made life on campus difficult.

Threats: Knox says both she and her family have received threats since her identity was revealed

She says she can't go out like she used to anymore because fellow students are hostile to her - especially other girls.

However,
 Knox says the majority of campus is on her side and supportive. She 
estimated that 70 per cent of her fellow students, especially the LGBTQ 
community, were behind her while the other 30 per cent of 'frat guys' 
and girls seem to 'hate' her

Also on the show, Morgan asked how Knox came up with her stage name. 

She
 says the first name is for the princess in the Beauty and the Beast, as
 well as the character Belle de Jour from British television drama 
'Secret Diary of a Call Girl'.

She
 takes her last name from Amanda Knox, the infamous 26-year-old 
suspected of sexually assaulting and then murdering her British roommate
 while studying abroad in Italy in 2007.

'She's
 just a really interesting person. I'm not saying I support her or 
anything...she just seems very intelligent,' the Duke student said.
