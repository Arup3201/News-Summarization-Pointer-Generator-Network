A tugboat captain has been jailed after one of his crew died during a violent storm.

Martin Richley, who also owns the 31ft tug, admitted putting his crew at serious risk when they sailed out on February 3, 2013.

They were towing a motor cruiser from the River Medway to Brighton when the towline snapped in the severe weather.

Steven Trice, 55, from Medway in Kent, attempted to reattach the line, but fell overboard and was lost at sea. His body was recovered 11 weeks later near Beachy Head, East Sussex.

Richley, 39, was sentenced to eight months in prison at Southampton Crown Court on Friday. 

Earlier the Marine Accident Investigation Branch described Mr Trice's attempt to reattach the line as 'extremely dangerous'. 

'It was a desperate and ill-considered measure brought about by the use of poor towing practices, a disregard of the weather forecasts and a lack of planning, risk assessment and emergency preparedness, its report said. 

In passing sentence His Honour Judge Ralls Q.C said

'This was a catalogue of disasters, Mr Richly was prepared to take a chance*. it was a disaster waiting to happen after a series of bad decisions.'

Captain Andrew Rudge, MCA Area Operations Manager said;

'This was a tragic incident that should not have happened. Mr Richley should not have accepted to take on the tow as he was ill equipped, unqualified and his vessel was not suitable.'
