A young girl suffered through months of pain, sickness, and numerous medical visits before doctors could figure out what was causing her mystery illness.

When she was just four years old, Sophie Oliver was playing with her older sister when she suffered a severe coughing fit. Her mother, a nurse, rushed her to the doctors immediately.

But it wasn't until five months later and after almost a dozen medical appointments that doctors found a steel Barbie ring lodged in the toddler's throat, the NZ Herald reported.

Sophie Oliver, now eight, suffered through months of pain as a child after she got a steel Barbie ring lodged in her throat

Sophie's mother Sue-Anne Oliver took her young daughter - now eight years old - to many doctors but no one managed to discover the cause of her sickness.

She was repeatedly prescribed antibiotics but nothing seemed to be working for Sophie.

'She lost weight. She was looking like a walking skeleton with her head on one side. She couldn't eat,' Mrs Oliver, from Tuakau south of Auckland, told the website.

However when it was suspected their may be a problem with Sophie's tonsils, the young girl was taken to an ear, nose and throat specialist. This was a relief to Mrs Oliver who admitted the grim thought of cancer had crossed her mind. 

A x-ray done by an ear, nose and throat specialist revealed the ring was embedded in her trachea

At the doctor's private practice he took an x-ray on the suspicion that Sophie may have swallowed a foreign object.

His suspicions were confirmed when the scan showed Sophie's sister Siobhain's ring firmly stuck in her throat, blocking her trachea.

'The radiologist was struck speechless momentarily as the x-ray revealed a ring was lodged in Sophie's trachea. We were overwhelmed with emotion, both relief and terror,' Mrs Oliver said.

The toddler was then taken to the Starship Children's Health centre in New Zealand and had to undergo surgery to remove the piece of jewellery which had become embedded in her throat after being there for so long.

After being put in an induced coma for three days and two more rounds of surgery Sophie was given the all clear by doctors. 

The Oliver family still have the ring that caused their youngest daughter so much trouble.
