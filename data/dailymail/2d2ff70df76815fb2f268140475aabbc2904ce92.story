Many people have two jobs to pay the rent, but one young mother is leading a bizarre double working life.

Zoe Bull is a super strong champion weightlifter by night but by day she is Minnie Mouse.

Zoe, 26, works as a children's party host where she arrives in her fancy dress costume as the genteel Minnie Mouse ready to play games with the youngsters.

But after work she is transformed into Zoe 'The Bull' where she can lift double her 9st 4lb weight as a top powerlifter.

After hours: By night, Zoe is transformed into Zoe 'The Bull' where she can lift double her 9st 4lb weight as a top powerlifter

She has just been crowned champion in the British Powerlifting Organisation's Welsh Championships - but then is happy to go back to being Minnie.

Mini-marvel Zoe from Porth, Rhondda, South Wales, said: 'People who know me as a powerlifter are amazed that I'm Minnie Mouse - and those who know me as a children's entertainer are amazed at the weights I lift.'

'Really I'm a real girly girl. People can't believe it when I tell them my other passion.

'You'd never think when you see me facepainting and holding hands with the kids that I can bench twice my weight!

Girly girl: By day: Zoe says she is a true girly girl at heart and is the only one who wears make-up and nail varnish to compete

Single mother Zoe adores playing with children - and dresses up in glittery Disney-inspired costumes as part of her own business called Teddy Bear Picnic parties.

She has three daughters aged two to eight who she loves dressing up in the latest fashions.

But then Zoe shoots down to the gym when she has earned her nickname of 'The Bull'.

Zoe said: 'In the gym I'm a different person. When I lift I growl and roar. If it hurts I'll shout - anything to get the best out of my body.

'I must have a high pain threshold. The support suits I wear to lift cut in to my skin, they are so tight I can bleed from sores where they rub.'

Despite the sweaty and macho atmosphere around weights and the gym Zoe still prides herself on her appearance in the 60kg.

She said: 'I make a real effort to look nice all the time.

'I wouldn't go to the gym without my make up - no way. At competitions I'm the only power lifter in full make up and with nail varnish on!

'There is such a change in me when I'm lifting. I use it as stress relief. I lift away life's stresses and I can just be myself.

'When I go to the gym I'm no one's mammy, I don't have to think about anyone else. I'm just me.'
