Killed his father: Jonas Nelson, 18, shot his dad at close range as he slept on the couch on Monday night

A Minnesota teenager shot his father in the head as he was sleeping on the couch so he didn’t have to 'deal with him’ anymore.

Jonas
 David Nelson, 18, took his father’s tall, silver bolt action 300 rifle 
from the gun cabinet and then ‘did it to him’, according to police.

The incident happened just after 11pm on Monday in their small two-story house on five acres southeast of Montgomery.

The boy initially told investigators that someone else had shot his father, Richard Nelson, 47, as he was upstairs in his bedroom, but eventually admitted to the crime.

‘Nelson explained that when he came 
downstairs to get some water, he saw his dad sleeping on the floor and 
he doesn't know for sure why, but he went into the gun cabinet and got 
one of the rifles and then "did it to him",’ the complaint said, 
according to The Mankato Free Press.

Nelson's
 father and mother, Kristina Singer, were divorced and he had been 
living with his mother in Prior Lake until August. He told 
investigators he moved into his father's house after having a 
disagreement with his mother.

‘As
 the conversation continued, Nelson explained that his dad was blaming 
his mother for the divorce when actually it was his dad's fault for his 
mother leaving him,’ the complaint said.

He told the investigators things had 
been ‘weird’ since he moved back. He also described his father as being 
‘harsh’ with religious views that ‘screwed him up as a parent’, the 
complaint said.

The past month had been rough because his father was 
acting like a ‘probation officer’.

Richard
 Nelson had already left the house Monday morning when Nelson junior got
 up at about 8:30 a.m.

He said he added a load of wood to the wood 
burner in the living room because the furnace wasn't working properly.

His dad returned home at about 1:30 pm and questioned him about keeping the wood burning furnace going, the complaint said, according to the Free Press.

The boy then went upstairs and did not come down until dinner time, which is when he saw his father sleeping.

‘Nelson explained he got the tall silver bolt action 300 rifle from the gun cabinet, he got some cartridges from the drawer and the "took his time" walking into the living room and stood in front of the stove and "took his life".'

Nelson also told the investigators he had never been driven to rage before, but he ‘just snapped’ because of the way his dad had been treating him.

He said he thought about killing his father in his sleep while he was sitting upstairs, according to the complaint.

He allegedly said he shot his father at close range and that he placed the two fired cartridges in a bucket in the basement.

The investigators reported they asked Nelson how he felt about shooting his father.

‘He replied that part of him feels good because he doesn't have to deal with him, but the other part realizes his dad isn't there anymore,’ the complaint said.

Nelson appeared briefly in Le Sueur County District Court, along with his mother, just before noon Wednesday for a charge of second-degree murder.

His bail was set at $2 million.
