Charley Hull has become the youngest winner of the Ladies European Tour Order of Merit - just 12 months after being named Rookie of the Year.

The 18-year-old from Kettering sealed the award after finishing joint fifth at the Dubai Ladies Masters on Saturday, a final-day 72 leaving her on 10 under for the tournament.

Charley Hull was the season's top earner on Ladies European Tour with £208,500

That took Hull’s season’s earnings to 263,096.69 euros (£208,500) and left her 29,808 euros (£23,633) clear of second-placed Frenchwoman Gwladys Nocera, who was tied for 11th in Dubai.

Hull, who won her first professional title at the Lalla Meryem Cup in March and recorded nine top-10 finishes in 2014, said: “It’s good to win. I didn’t really know coming into this week.”

She added on the BBC Sport website: “I’m happy. Gwladys is a good player. Just on the back nine today, I thought, ‘don’t make any silly mistakes.’ I double bogeyed the first, but got two birdies on the bounce back, so pretty happy with myself there.”

Hull last year became the youngest player ever to compete in the Solheim Cup

China’s Shanshan Feng was the runaway winner of the Dubai Ladies Masters after a closing round of 70 left her on 19 under, with Spaniard Carlota Ciganda five shots behind in second.

Wales’ Amy Boulden, meanwhile, won the Rookie of the Year title after tying for 24th at Emirates Golf Club, pipping Scotland’s Sally Watson and Nicole Broch Larsen of Denmark to the crown.
