A pilot who was at the controls of a plane that crashed injuring UKIP leader Nigel Farage has been found dead.

Justin Adams, 48, was found by police at his home in Eastbourne, East Sussex, last month - and Mr Farage today revealed he was 'very sad' after hearing of the news.

Mr Adams was the pilot who was flying a light aircraft carrying Mr Farage on election day in May 2010 as part of a political stunt when the plane crashed into a field in Brackley, Northamptonshire.

An investigation later found that a banner attached to the plane had become entangled causing the plane to crash. Both Mr Farage and Mr Adams needed hospital treatment for their injuries.

After learning of Mr Adams' death, Mr Farage said today: 'It's a very tragic situation and I'm very sad about Mr Adams' passing.'

The pilot, who was left suffering from depression following the crash accused Mr Farage of 'ruining his life' following the crash.

Despite being cleared of any blame, Mr Adams was angry that the investigation took so long to complete and claimed that it was behind the break up of his marriage.

He also claimed that his business failed because he could not make an insurance claim until the inquiry was concluded and that he was forced to live with his elderly mother and 'incarcerated' in her house.

A year after the crash, Mr Adams was sentenced to a two-year community order for five counts of threatening to kill Mr Farage. He made the threats directly to Mr Farage and through a 999 operator.

During his trial the jury was played a recording of an exchange between a man calling himself Justin Adams and Sharon Bailey, a police inquiry centre officer at Thames Valley Police.

Mr Adams said: 'I'm going to kill somebody or two,' the court heard. Within the conversation, on the evening of November 28 last year, Mr Adams was heard to say: 'I know where they live, they destroyed my life.'

He later added: 'I now have a 9mm pistol, I've got the means - I will take them out and then myself.'

Mr Adams told the court that he had made the threats because he was desperate for treatment for drug and alcohol abuse.

According to the Independent, a Sussex Police spokesperson said: 'A man found dead at his home address (in) Eastbourne, on 12 November has been identified as Justin Adams, aged 48.

'A cause of death has not been established but it is not being treated as suspicious. An inquest has been opened and adjourned.'
