A police force has become the butt of jokes after appealing for witnesses to the theft of a packet of Scotch eggs worth Â£1.65.

A woman was caught on CCTV walking into a branch of the Co-Op in Minehead, Somerset and picking up the budget snacks before eating them and leaving without paying.

Avon and Somerset Police apparently spent a month investigating the crime before launching an online appeal in a bid to identify the woman.

In a post on Facebook, officers wrote: 'The theft has been reported to police and an investigation has begun.

'If you recognise the woman, contact Avon and Somerset Police on 101 and quote 9774/14.'

However, the petty nature of the offence led dozens of web users to mock the force for its over-zealous policing.

BBC presenter Jeremy Vine wrote: 'It's all kicking off in Minehead - after investigating for a MONTH, here's what the police have got.'

D. Reid Macpherson joked: 'They will have difficulty cracking the case.'

Paul Connew said: 'Am I too hard-boiled by thinking the cops' brains scrambled by trying to crack it? Farcical.'

'Puncroaker' added: 'Well done Somerset police, targeting the hard-boiled criminals.'

And Chris Wright said: 'Got to nip it in the bud early, today it's Scotch eggs, tomorrow pork pies, pretty soon they'll have a full picnic.'

Avon and Somerset Police has now deleted the appeal, after a witness came forward claiming to know who the thief was.

A spokesman said: 'We take all crimes that are reported to us seriously. Using social media can be a valuable tool for us and take just minutes to do.

'Last month two women were arrested within hours of a robbery appeal being published and we've also been able to return stolen property to their owners.

'On this occasion someone rang with a name within two hours and we are currently looking into this information.'

The force appears to have an affinity hot pastry snacks - chief constable Nick Gargan tweeted today about enjoying 'a cheese and onion pasty from Greggs on the M4 at Reading'.
