When the Colorado River snaked its way through Arizona, it sliced its way through ancient canyons, at least one of which was 70 million years old.

This is according to a new U.S. study which claims that while parts of the gorge are ancient, the river only carved the present form of the Grand Canyon less than 6 million years ago.

The makes the world famous landmark relatively young in geological terms, and 65 million years younger than previously believed.

Researchers divided the Grand Canyon into sections and analysed the rocks in each. They found that most of it was put in place just five to six million years ago.  Earlier studies had claimed the canyon was perhaps 70 million years old

The debate over the age of the Grand Canyon has raged for 150 years. 

Proponents of  'old canyon model' argue that the Grand Canyon was carved 70 million years ago in the same place and to nearly the same depth as the modern canyon.

There is a group of researchers, however, that support the 'young canyon model', which claims the canyon was cut entirely in the last six million years.

This new study refutes both of these models by arguing that some segments are very ancient, but says the full system - which makes up the majority of the Grand Canyon - is young.

The study, however, will do little to settle the debate over the Grand Canyon's age. Much of the canyon's history has been eroded or carried away by the river.

What
 remains is open to interpretation, with some scientists suggesting the 
gorge cannot be defined as the ‘Grand Canyon’ without  the Colorado 
river running through it.

Geologists used a technique called thermochronology which dates events by measuring temperature of rocks, revealing when those at the surface now replaced others that had been removed by erosion.

The study, published in Nature Geoscience, found two parts are ancient, one being created between 50 and 70 million years ago and the other 15 to 25 million years old.

But the remaining two were carved just five to six million years ago when the Grand Canyon became one giant thoroughfare when all the smaller segments became linked due to erosion from the Colorado River.

The data found one segment known as Marble Canyon was beneath several kilometres of rock strata and so was not carved until the last six million years.

Another called the eastern Grand Canyon, the area visited by five million tourists to the National Park a year, was about half carved to the level of the red cliffs between 25 and 15 million years ago.

But the inner gorge was carved in the last six million years by the powerful Colorado River.

Professor Karl Karlstrom, of the University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, said the timing of the Grand Canyon's formation has been vigorously debated for almost 150 years.

‘In one view, most of the canyon was carved by the Colorado River relatively recently, in the past five to six million years,’ he said.

‘Alternatively, the Grand Canyon could have been cut by precursor rivers in the same location and to within about 200 metres of its modern depth as early as 70 to 55 million years ago.’

The study, however, will do little to settle the debate over the Grand Canyon's age which has raged for decades.

Much of the canyon's history has been eroded or carried away by the river.

What remains is open to interpretation, with some scientists suggesting the gorge cannot be defined as the ‘Grand Canyon’ without  the Colorado river running through it.

‘Two of the three middle segments, the Hurricane segment and the Eastern Grand Canyon, formed between 70 and 50 million years ago and between 25 and 15 million years ago, respectively,’ said Professor Karlstrom.

‘However, the two end segments, the Marble Canyon and the Westernmost Grand Canyon, are both young and were carved in the past five to six million years.

‘Thus, although parts of the canyon are old, we conclude the integration of the Colorado River through older palaeocanyons carved the Grand Canyon, beginning five to six million years ago.’
