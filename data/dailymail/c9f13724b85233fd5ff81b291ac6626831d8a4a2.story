Just one in 16 people living in Wales is paying the higher rate of tax according to the latest Government statistics.

HM Revenue and Customs show that only 89,000 people in the country pay the 40 per cent rate, proportionally less than in England where one in 10 are in the bracket.

Meanwhile, the top rate of 50 per cent, on incomes above £150,000, was paid by only 4,000.

Figures from HMRC have revealed during 2010-11 only one in 16 Welsh taxpayers paid the higher rate of 40p in the pound

Government forecasters have suggested the number paying the 40p tax rate, on incomes between £34,000 and £150,000, in Wales was expected to increase to 108,000 for the last tax year and 117,000 this year, The Telegraph has reported.

Meanwhile, the overall number of taxpayers fell during the same period from 1.4million in 2010-11 to 1.35million in 2012-13.

A higher proportion of taxpayers in Scotland paid the 40 per cent rate in 2010-11, with 227,000 people out of 2.67million paying that amount.

Elfyn Llwyd, the Plaid Cymru leader in Westminster said the figure was low and historically always had been.

He said: 'Captains of industry in Wales may be residing elsewhere.

'It is a reflection of a failure of governments to increase Wales's gross domestic product.'

Welsh officials have said income tax revenues had grown at roughly the same rate throughout Britain over the past decade.

A Wales Office spokesman said: 'We have seen positive signs in recent months with 38,000 more people in employment than this time last year.'
