Doctors are being paid up to £3,000 per shift to fill gaps in NHS A&E rotas.

Wye Valley NHS Trust, in Hertfordshire, paid £3,717 for one doctor to work a 30-hour shift, the highest single payment of any NHS body.

Some doctors were paid not just for the hours they spent in the hospital, but also time they spent on call, including time they spent asleep.

In total £242million was spent by A&E departments in 2013 on agency doctors, enough to pay for 3,00 full time consultants

An investigation by The Sunday Telegraph revealed that a total bill for all agency workers in 2013 was £242million, enough to pay for 3,000 consultants or 7,000 junior doctors.

Data showed that NHS hospitals are regularly employing shift workers to cover staff shortages, despite senior managers insisting that rates of £1,000 or more were only paid in crisis situations.

Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust paid above that rate on 719 occasions last year, Kettering General Hospital Foundation Trust paid out 595 times.

Barking, Redbridge, and Havering University HospitalsTrust in Essex, which was placed into special measures over a severe shortage of senior casualty doctors, had the highest total bill at £7.9million.

Dr Cliff Mann, the most senior A&E doctor in the UK, told The Sunday Telegraph: 'The use of agency doctors has become endemic in the NHS.

'There are units which would implode if they weren't relying on them day in, day out.

'The worst of it is that with the money we are wasting on temporary staff we could double the number of A&E consultants, if only a more long-term approach was taken.'

A freedom of information request found that hospitals were also paying up to £1,600 per shift for nurses.

Staff shortages have forced hospitals to fill gaps in their rota with expensive shift doctors, who can collect cash while on call and asleep

In January it was revealed that GPs are also being paid nearly £1,500 a shift to work nights and weekends in crisis-hit A&E units.

Four in ten casualty departments are hiring family doctors – already paid an average £104,000 a year – to help deal with the soaring numbers of patients.

Hourly rates vary from £50 at Wirral hospital in Merseyside to £98 at Wrightington, Wigan, and £100 at Portsmouth Hospitals.

Later the same month, understaffed A&E departments were found to be spending more than £80million a year hiring locum doctors.

The average casualty unit is paying £750,000 annually for temporary medics to plug rota gaps, with some shelling out more than £4million.

A&E is in the grip of a recruitment crisis with most junior doctors put off by the intense work, antisocial hours and low pay.

At the same time rising numbers of trained casualty doctors are quitting the NHS to work abroad where salaries are higher and standards of care better.

Hospitals are having to rely increasingly on expensive locums who tend to be less competent, more inexperienced and prone to mistakes as they are unfamiliar with equipment.
