BBC staff danced to the Jim’ll Fix It theme tune at a Television Centre party, it was claimed today.

Journalists are alleged to have played the song over and over again, as they celebrated a move across London to Broadcasting House.

And the group, which included some correspondents, reporters and senior producers, are said to have cheered each time it came on, the Mirror reports.

The party is said to have been held just metres away from where Savile (pictured) was said to have carried out some of his worst sex offences

The party was just a few hundred yards from dressing rooms where Savile is said to committed some of his worst sex crimes.

The bash was being held to celebrate the BBC  move from Bush House, its London home for over 70 years, to a new state of the art, multimedia broadcasting centre in the heart of the capital.

A source told the paper staff had been in high spirits as they partied with food, music and drink.

They said: 'It was your standard office party until one bright spark decided to play the Jim’ll Fix It theme tune on their iPod. Amazingly people seemed to love it and started dancing and cheering.'

The source claimed it happened several times over the course of the evening  with the same reaction.

They claimed it was only after one of the 'most ­disapproving stares anyone has ever seen' from a senior member of staff, that it stopped.The BBC refused to comment or give dates for when the party could have taken place.

It confirmed the move to Broadcasting House started in April and will continue until next year.
