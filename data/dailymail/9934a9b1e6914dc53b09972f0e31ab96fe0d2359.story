Celtic's Manchester City loanee John Guidetti gave a demonstration of his considerable talents by scoring a brilliant free-kick for Sweden's under-21 side on Friday night.

The 22-year-old, who moved to Celtic Park last week, has made just one first team appearance for City since joining as a teenager seven years ago.

But he showed why he is rated so highly by the Manchester club when he scored with a fabulous strike from 30 yards.

Lining it up: Guidetti stands over the 30-yard free-kick while playing for Sweden under-21s

Pure strike: The Celtic youngster takes his shot lifting it over the wall and towards the far corner

Great hit: The keeper is well beaten as the ball dips underneath the crossbar and into the corner of the net

The Swedish star smashed the ball over the wall and got it to swerve and dip into the corner, in a style reminiscent of Cristiano Ronaldo.  

Guidetti spent the second half of last season on loan at Stoke where he mustered six appearances without scoring. 

He had a far more prolific spell with Feyenoord three years ago when he notched 20 goals in 23 appearances.

Struggle: The Swede has been unable to breakthrough at Manchester City since joining in 2007

Delighted: Guidetti has expressed his delight at joining Celtic on loan for the season
