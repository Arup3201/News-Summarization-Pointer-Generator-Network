After years spent fighting to keep his Atlanta mansion, prominent music producer and rapper Jermaine Dupri has now lost his palatial home to foreclosure.

Dupri, 42, bought the six-bedroom, 7-bath 9,441-square-foot estate in 2005 for $3.2million.

The real estate site Zillow estimates that the sprawling mansion sitting on 1.73 acres of land is currently worth just under $5million.

According to Fulton County legal notices, Dupri, who over the years has worked with such A-list acts as Kriss Kros, Usher, Mariah Carey and TLC, has fallen behind on his monthly payments.

Dupri, the founder of the So So Def record label, was able to stop his home from being auctioned off twice in 2013 by successfully challenging a bank's claim that he owed them nearly $200,000 in mortgage payments, according to a report y the pop culture blog The Jasmine Brand.

The bank later said that the songwriter was on the hook for $400,000, but the judge sided with Dupri and took his mansion off the auction block.

The 42-year-old Atlanta native reportedly has made a deal with the bank agreeing to pay off his debt in monthly installments.

Then in November, the owner of the deed of the mansion set the foreclosure proceedings in motion, stating that Dupri has not been making payments on a $2.5million loan he took out on the mansion nine years ago, reported Atlanta Journal Constitution. 

The mansion featuring a fireplace and a pool, and surrounded by manicured lawns and trees, is expected to go up for sale later this month.

Lap of luxury: Only three weeks ago, Dupri shared this photo on his Instagram account showing him sitting down for an interview with MTV in his well-appointed living room

Jermaine Dupri, who got his start as a teenage backup dancer, has been a mainstay in the world of show business for many years, helping launch the careers of De Brat, Xscape and the teen duo Kriss Kross whose 1992 record Totally Krossed went multi-platinum.

Between the late 90s and mid-2000s, he collaborated with Destiny's Child, Lil Wayne and Mariah Carey, including on her chart-topping single We Belong Together from the 2005 album The Emancipation of Mimi, which won him a Grammy.

Miss Carey hired Dupri as her talent manager in 2013 replacing Randy Jackson, but the two parted ways this past August. 

Dupri has a 16-year-old daughter from a past relationship. In 2001, he started dating pop star Janet Jackson but the pair broke up in 2009.

Dupri hit a rough patch last year when SunTrust Bank filed a lawsuit against him and his record label asking for $1.9million.

The producer later counter-sued the bank, accusing it of changing the terms of his loans and making it impossible for him to pay off his debt. 

Then earlier this year, a former road manager filed a lawsuit against Dupri demanding four years’ worth of overtime pay.

According to the site Celebrity Net Worth, Dupri's personal net worth currently stands at $2million - down from about $60million in his heyday the mid-90s.
