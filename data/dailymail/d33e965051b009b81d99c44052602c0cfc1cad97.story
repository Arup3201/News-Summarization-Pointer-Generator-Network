Hillary Clinton may be the presumptive Democratic frontrunner in the 2016 presidential race, but she is by no means the party's 'inevitable' nominee, a likely challenger said Thursday.

'Maybe that's the way it is today,' former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley acknowledged on MSNBC's 'Morning Joe' program.

'Most years there is the inevitable frontrunner. And that inevitable frontrunner is inevitable right up until he or she is no longer inevitable,' he added.

NOT 'INEVITABLE'? Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley threw cold water on the idea that his party will give Hillary Clinton a neasy route to a presidential nomination

BLOODBATH: Clinton faced bruising questions on Tuesday at the United Nations from a crush of reorters fixated on 'email-gate'

The timing of O'Malley's jab is notable. Clinton is  embroiled in controversy about her use of a private email account for her entire four years as secretary of state, and her Tuesday press conference did little to quell the furor.

But O'Malley seemed to dismiss the growing scandal.

Even if the federal government had an iron-clad retention policy that covered every agency, he said, it's not the sort of thing he wants to campaign on.

'None of that would make a hill of difference,' O'Malley insisted, to Americans struggling to make ends meet in a time of slow economic growth.

Clinton's never-ending email story is 'not the issue that's going to restore our economy,' the former governor said.

'People don't care so much about email policies.' 

Still, he said it was 'important' for the former secretary of state to follow federal laws and regulations. 

A New York Times report Thursday said that congressional Democrats are still desperate for Mrs. Clinton to run in 2016, saying she is 'simply too big to fail.'

While she tops all polls on who Democrats would pick for president, O'Malley countered the notion that the most powerful woman in American politics was a lock for the nomination.

And he stressed that if he threw his hat in the ring, he would not be aiming for a consolation prize like the vice presidency or a cabinet post.

'I would be running not only to win but to govern well, to make the case to the people of the country there are better choices we can make together that will make wages go up and to make college more affordable for our kids again,' O'Malley said.

'We don't have any announced candidates yet,' he noted, 'but I've never run a bad race and I've never gone all out when I've gone all in.'

TIMING: The 'Morning Joe' appearance on MSNBC came during a week when Clinton's feet are being held to the fire in what's being called 'email-gate'

He said he expected a 'robust conversation' among Democrats during the campaign.

But O'Malley appeared unwilling to unsheathe the knives just yet, declining to say whether Clinton did anything wrong in her email kerfuffle.

He said he will announce his political intentions this spring. Clinton observers expect her to do the same.

Last week, when Maryland's long-serving Senator Barbara Mikulski announced she would not seek re-election in 2016, instead of jumping into the battle to replace her, O'Malley begged off.

Still, he has a long way to go – on the calendar and in polls.

An NBC survey this week showed Clinton with 86 percent support, versus just 11 percent for O'Malley.

'Am I really up to 11 percent?' he asked with a grin.
