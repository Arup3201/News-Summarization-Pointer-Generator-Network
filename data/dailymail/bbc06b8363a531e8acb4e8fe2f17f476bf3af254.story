The Macedonian government has been accused of being too lenient despite imposing laws which would allow paedophile repeat offenders to be castrated. 

Macedonia has adopted a bill imposing chemical castration on repeat offenders convicted of sexually abusing children. 

However, the country's leading child protection group says the law is still too lenient.

Macedonia has adopted a bill imposing chemical castration on repeat offenders convicted of sexually abusing children

The Megjasi child protection group, which had campaigned for the procedure to be imposed on paedophiles, said today that the penalty should be mandatory for first time offenders. 

Lawmakers voted on Monday to make penalties harsher for convicted pedophiles increasing the maximum sentence to life imprisonment and imposing chemical castration on second-time offenders.

The procedure involves regular injections that decrease the production of testosterone.

The bill doesn't specify a length of time for the treatment.

If imposed after an initial conviction, 'chemical castration would prevent first time offenders repeating the crime,' said Megjasi head Dragi Zmijanac.

Zmijanac said his organisation estimates that about 1,000 children are victims of sexual abuse and harassment in Macedonia each year, but only about a quarter to a third of those cases are reported to the police.

'Many victims do not report because perpetrators are usually their close relatives or friends,' he said.

Police, however, have registered a decreasing number of cases of sexual assault against children in the country with a population of 2.1 million people.

According to their figures, 90 cases were reported in 2010, 53 in 2012 and 43 cases in the first nine months of 2013 â€” the most recent figures available.The Macedonian Ministry of Labor and Social Policy said 23 people were convicted of pedophilia in 2013.

Several other European countries also have legislation allowing for the chemical castration of paedophiles. In June 2012, Macedonia launched an online register of convicted pedophiles who had been released, containing their pictures, names and addresses.
