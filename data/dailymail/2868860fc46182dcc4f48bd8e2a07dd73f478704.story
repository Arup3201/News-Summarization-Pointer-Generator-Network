The FA have moved to calm crowd security fears ahead of November’s revival of the Scotland-England rivalry.

With opinion polls for next week’s Scottish referendum poised on a knife-edge, England fans were heard chanting, ‘**** off Scotland, we’re all voting yes’ during Monday night’s Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland.

Passion: An England supporter in Switzerland on Monday night

An away support of just under 10,000 England fans are expected at Celtic Park on November 18 for the first meeting of the nations in Scotland for 15 years.

Once an annual fixture, the match was revived when 20,000 members of the Tartan Army travelled to England to watch a 3-2 defeat last August.

That match passed off peacefully and English FA spokesman Adrian Bevington says measures are already being discussed to avert any potential flashpoints in November, the match coming four days after Gordon Strachan’s team meet the Republic of Ireland in a Euro qualifier.

‘We are working closely with our colleagues at the Scottish FA and are taking all usual security precautions,’ said Bevington. 

‘We were pleased that the Wembley fixture in August 2013 passed peacefully with over 20,000 Scotland fans adding to the occasion and atmosphere of respectful rivalry.

‘Over the last decade we have been proud of our official travelling support and the improvement in behaviour, which has resulted in no arrests at any of the last four major tournaments.’
