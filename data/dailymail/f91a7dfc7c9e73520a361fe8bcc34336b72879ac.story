Until 12 days before the referendum, David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg were all convinced victory for the Union was a foregone conclusion.

With good reason, it appeared.

Historically, breaking from the UK has rarely been supported by much more than a third of people in Scotland. Even as the debate hotted up this year, for all Alex Salmond’s bluster he did not seem to be gaining much ground.

The YouGov poll was published by The Sunday Times, which is owned by Rupert Murdoch who tweeted that the survey showed 'everything [was] up for grabs' in the independence referendum

In nearly 100 opinion polls conducted from January to the day of the referendum, only three showed a lead for the ‘Yes’ camp.

The organisers of two admitted to unintended errors. The third, conducted by influential pollsters YouGov on September 6, and published by The Sunday Times, owned by Rupert Murdoch’s News UK, caused a sensation.

It claimed the ‘Yes’ camp had surged into the lead on 51, with ‘No’ on 49, a two-point lead.

Gleeful Mr Murdoch seized on it to pile pressure on Cameron and Miliband, boasting on Twitter that his ‘reliable independence poll will shock Britain and more – everything up for grabs’.

He also tweeted: ‘Scottish independence means huge black eye for Cameron and Miliband.’

YouGov’s two-point lead for Scottish nationalists convinced the SNP that they were on the verge of a historic breakthrough – and caused a nervous breakdown in Westminster. 

Cameron, Miliband and Clegg had seen support for independence creep up in the last few weeks of the campaign, but believed it was too little too late.

The poll turned all that upside down. The three party leaders were gripped with terror that the unthinkable was about to happen: the UK was about to be broken up.

They would all probably resign in shame and a place would be found in the history books for Cameron next to Lord North – PM when Britain lost America.

So they did what politicians do in a crisis – panicked and threw money at it. Dave and Red Ed called off their weekly joust in Prime Minister’s Questions and, Clegg in tow, scurried north to rally the pro-Union vote.

Just three days before D-Day they vowed to extend the Barnett formula, whereby Scots get £1,600 per head more from taxpayers than people in England, worth £4.5 billion a year, or £45 billion over the next decade. So much for ‘austerity Britain’.

And for good measure they promised more home rule for Scotland – without bothering to consult anybody. Cynics called it a bribe. 

The three party leaders rushed to Scotland to give speeches after the shock poll, including Ed Miliband who was hounded out of a shopping centre

Yet, when the referendum result was announced, it appeared they needn’t have worried after all. If the ‘No’ camp had won by a whisker, Cameron and co could have claimed their last-minute offer made all the difference.

Instead the ‘No’ camp won by an overwhelming ten-point margin, a 12-point turnaround from the YouGov poll 12 days earlier. It led some to ask if it was a ‘rogue poll’.

One day before the referendum a YouGov poll showed the ‘No’ camp back in the lead by two points.

There is no suggestion of wrongdoing by YouGov. All opinion polls are subject to a margin of error and, unlike for general elections, polling companies did not have past results to help refine their results.

YouGov president Peter Kellner defended the survey which showed the ‘Yes’ camp ahead by two. 

‘It was not a rogue poll,’ he said.

‘There was a whole series of polls following ours showing it was neck and neck, 50-50 plus or minus one.'
