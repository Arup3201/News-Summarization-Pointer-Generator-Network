As her beloved daughter lay dying two years ago, Charla Moye asked doctors to do something other parents might consider unthinkable: 'At least save her organs'.

It's a decision the cardiac nurse does not regret. She tragically lost her 'baby', but four organ recipients are now alive thanks to Liane Adgate's body parts.

During the worst weekend of her life, Moye agreed to let the Tampa Bay Times follow her and watch the recovery of her daughter's organs in a bid to raise awareness about donations.

Heartbreaking: Charla Moye holds her daughter Liana's hand one last time before she is taken to an operating room to have her organs recovered

Moye's 31-year-old daughter Liane suffered a massive stroke in April 2011.

Liane was rushed to hospital and placed on life support. But the swelling in the young mom's brain spread quickly and soon blood seeped into the right side. Liane had a seven-year-old daughter, Kara.

Almost two
 days after Liane's horrific stroke, a doctor pronounced 
her brain dead. It was about 12.45pm on a Monday.

That's when Moyes, 58, made the toughest decision of her life - to donate Liane's organs.

Leaning over her daughter, pressing the young woman's hand against her wet cheek, she whispered: 'You did good, honey. You're going to help so 
many people.'

Moye had worked on transplant cases at
 Tampa General, where her daughter was now on
 life support. She knew how many people were waiting for organs, hoping 
to get a second chance.

Anyone who dies could save eight lives: two kidneys, two lungs, liver, pancreas, small intestine and heart. More than 50 more people might benefit if skin and tissue are also donated.

Meanwhile, outside in the hospital hall, a transplant team was assembling and specialists began streaming into the room.

Each organ had its own support team, with more than 100 people working on each donor.

Tampa Bay Times reported that doctors worked frantically to test Liane's organs.

A
 pulmonologist threaded a scope down Liane's throat to search her lungs 
for signs of pneumonia before wrapping a white vest around her chest to stop the build-up of secretions.

A kidney surgeon ordered blood tests to check for infection as a cardiologist took an ultrasound of Liane's heart. Hearts have to be working at a level of at least 50 percent to be transplanted. Liane's was at 35.

Preparation: Liane's liver is cleaned, packaged and kept on ice for the team of doctors that will transplant it into an awaiting recipient

At the nurses' station, two 
LifeLink workers added Liane's age, height, weight and blood type
 to a database called United Network Organ Sharing to identify suitable organ recipients.

'It
 takes such difficult coordination to keep all these organs viable, then
 to get them all placed,' Dr. Tarik Haddad, the pulmonologist, said.

'And
 once the recipients are found, they have to be called in for pre-op. So
 we have to know where each organ is going before we recover it.'

Specialists began the search for suitable recipients about 4.15pm by logging onto local waiting lists, 
starting with the sickest and 
those who'd waited the longest.

Kidneys
can be transplanted up to 36 hours after recovery and flown all the 
way across the country, while eyes and tissue can be shipped overseas.

On
 the third query about the liver, match specialists found a recipient 
close enough to drive to Tampa General.

On the fourth call for the 
kidney, they connected with a man nearby who had been waiting three 
years. The surgery was a success.

Heartbreaking: While in the hospital room, Charla Moye taped a picture of Liane's six-year-old daughter, Kara, over her heart

After they had called 70 hospitals in Florida about the lungs and pancreas, the specialists started widening their range, 500 miles at a time.

By midnight, the two women had logged more than 300 calls, texts and emails.

Just before 9am Tuesday, the transplant coordinator said surgeons declined Liane's heart. Too much time had passed.

For Moye, it was as if Liane had died all over again. She collapsed in sadness.

Once
 the heart stops, lungs have to be transplanted within four hours, 
livers within 12. Kidneys can last two days. Bones and skin can be 
stored for two years.

Moyes leaned over her daughter's body, wiped each closed lid with her thumb and whispered, 'I love you'.

'She will always be my baby': When cardiac nurse Charla Moye's 31-year-old daughter, Liane, passed away the decision to donate her organs was a priority - as a way to find a bright spot in a tragedy

At 12.30pm, doctors removed Liane's three-pound liver.

One specialist ran a cold preservation solution through the organ to flush the warm blood and slow metabolism.

Then they doused the liver in a bowl of clear saline slush before it was packaged in a bag with crushed ice.

In three hours, the team preserved the liver, one lung and both kidneys.

Specialists couldn't find a match for the pancreas or small intestine, so they left them intact.Â 

In the end, four organs were recovered which meant the lives of four strangers had been saved.

'Oh, that's wonderful!' Moye sobbed.

'I want to meet them. I want my granddaughter to meet them too, to see the people her mommy helped.

'I want to tell them about Liane. I want them to know the good they have inside them.'
