A jobless single mother who flaunted her notoriety as a serial shoplifter with the boast, ‘At least I’m famous’, has finally been locked up.

Jade Underwood was banned from 80 stores and had her photograph displayed on police posters after stealing relentlessly and terrorising her community.

Just two weeks after being made the subject of a Crasbo – a criminal anti-social behaviour order – the 23-year-old returned to her old habits.

'At least I am famous': Single mother Jade Underwood appeared to enjoy the comparison made between her and character Vicky Pollard, right, who was played by Matt Lucas in the comedy Little Britain

Magistrates were told that she was caught stealing £110 of perfume from Debenhams in Stockport.

She also stole food and DVDs from another shop and ignored a community punishment order by failing to turn up for an appointment.

Underwood, who has been likened to Vicky Pollard, the foul-mouthed, tracksuit- bottomed character in Little Britain, has now been jailed for ten weeks for five offences of theft.

At Stockport magistrates court she was also barred from a  further 120 shops across the town centre. Yesterday one shopkeeper said they were relieved Underwood had finally been sent to prison. ‘That woman has been nothing but a menace,’ the shopowner said.

‘Prison’s probably too good for the likes of her, but at least it will keep her from us – for now.’

Neighbours said the 5ft tall mother of three treated shoplifting as a vocation, bragging about her daily sprees.

Shame: Bright yellow posters showing Jade's face were posted all around the area encouraging locals to report her if she flouted her CRASBO

One Boots store, in Edgeley, Stockport, had been targeted so many times that staff even stopped putting make-up on display.

She also verbally abused parents taking their children to and from a local primary school and tormented neighbours in the tower block she lived in before being evicted for playing loud music until 5am.

In May, after a catalogue of complaints about Underwood, police obtained the Crasbo, which differs from an Asbo in that it is imposed after a criminal conviction.

In court she was described as a ‘prolific shoplifter’ who ‘on numerous occasions used language and behaviour that has caused considerable alarm, harassment and distress to shop staff’.

Shameless: Mother-of-three Jade 'treated shoplifting like a job', would openly tell neighbours she was off to steal and refused to work because she was better off on benefits

The Crasbo barred Underwood from the main shopping street in Edgeley, a primary school and supermarkets.

Posters bearing her grim-faced photo were put up to encourage residents to report her if she flouted the bans.

But Underwood was undeterred and instead toasted her Crasbo on Facebook, posting a series of misspelt, crude messages from her new flat in Withington, Manchester.

One said: ‘Heyy yah dont bring me down, let meh tell u f***ing hell least am famouse sad stupid t**ts !! Yah all whata leve meh da f*** alone coz m8 u whata start playing games like dat ..!’

Despite the threat of prison, the posters made Jade feel like a celebrity and she was caught shoplifting again just two weeks later in Debenhams

Former neighbour John Duggan, 55, said: ‘This woman has absolutely no shame whatsoever. She would openly say to me, “I’m going shoplifting today.”

‘She was not ashamed about telling me.

‘A leopard can never change their spots. She will never stop what she is doing.

‘She used to wear tracksuits and looked just like Vicky Pollard from the TV show. She’s a little terror.’

Yesterday Pc Jon Daniels, of Greater Manchester Police, said: ‘When she stole something, she would sometimes become  abusive and shout in the middle of the store.

‘The jail sentence shows if you breach your order, what can happen.’

He added: ‘Shoplifting has a massive knock-on effect for stores and can really add up.

‘Shops can lose thousands in a month and can close down through stock loss.’

CJ's in Stockport was just one of the original 80 shops which Jade was banned from as a result of her persistent shoplifting
