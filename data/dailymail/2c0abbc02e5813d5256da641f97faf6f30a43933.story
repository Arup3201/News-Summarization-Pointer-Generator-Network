Discarded cigarette waste may be a blight on our streets, but researchers are hoping they could someday repurpose it into something useful.

So far, studies have looked into how cigarettes can power mobile phones, make shipping pallets and create stronger concrete.

Now a group of Chinese scientists has come up with a method of using cigarette ash to filter dangerous arsenic from water supplies.

Arsenic, a well-known poison, can be taken out of drinking water using sophisticated treatment methods.

But in places that lack the equipment or technical know-how required to remove it, it still laces drinking water and makes people sick.

A team, led by Jiaxing Li of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, coated cigarette ash with aluminium oxide.

Arsenic, a well-known poison, can be taken out of drinking water using sophisticated treatment methods. But in places that lack the equipment or technical know-how required to remove it, it still laces drinking water and makes people sick

Because it has a porous consistency, they suspected that the ash would be better at filtering arsenic than other materials that have been tried previously, such as banana peels.

When they tested the material with contaminated ground water, they found it removed more than 96 per cent of the arsenic, reducing its levels to below the standard set by the World Health Organisation. 

Naturally occurring and industry-related arsenic contaminates groundwater at high levels in many countries, including Chile, China, Hungary and Mexico. 

Worldwide, around 5.6 trillion used-cigarettes, or 766,571 tonnes, of used cigarettes are flicked onto pavements each year

Researchers from South Korea believe they can convert cigarette filters into a material that could be used by computers, electrical vehicles and wind turbines to store energy.

This material can be used to coat the electrodes of supercapacitors, which are components that can store extremely large amounts of electrical energy

The researchers claim the material's performance is even better that the commercially available carbon, graphene and carbon nanotubes currently used to do the same job. 

Worldwide, around 5.6 trillion used-cigarettes, or 766,571 tonnes, of used cigarettes are flicked onto pavements each year. That's equivalent to the weight of 380 London Eyes.

Co-author of the study Professor Jongheop Yi, from Seoul National University, said: 'Our study has shown that used-cigarette filters can be transformed into a high-performing carbon-based material using a simple one step process, which simultaneously offers a green solution to meeting the energy demands of society.

The odourless, tasteless element can cause skin discolouration, stomach pain, partial paralysis and a range of other serious health problems. 

While the technology for removing arsenic from water exists, it is expensive and impractical for rural and developing regions. 

Because cigarette ashes are discarded in countries around the world and can be easily collected in places where public smoking is allowed, it could be part of a low-cost solution for a serious public health issue, they claim.
