You’d think the last thing a fence that for years has had hundreds of bras hanging on it needs is support, but that’s the case for the Cardrona Valley Bra Fence in New Zealand.

For the past two years thieves have been stealing the bras off the fence, and in recent months there were regularly none to be seen on it at all. However, those who want to see the local tourist attraction remain are jumping out of their cups with anger.

Tired of being taken for boobs, the Cardrona Valley Bra Fence Facebook page has been updating its followers with tip-offs on who the thieves are. No one has been arrested by police yet, but the page is now asking its supporters to return to the fence with their ‘pre-loved’ bras to help recreate the attraction.

One of the venture’s most vocal supporters is Kelly Spaans, who owns the Cardrona Horse Trekking & Quad Biking business. The bra fence sits directly opposite her place of work, but she has no problem with it at all.

‘Generally the bras are taken at night, but on Tuesday, during the day, some local people took the 30 or so bras that were put there recently,’ she explained.

‘I saw them and have a good idea who they are. I’m sure these people could be prosecuted by the police for theft, but we don’t want to make too much of a stir out of it.

‘So instead we’re going to put up hundreds all at once so it’ll be very difficult for the thief or thieves to take them all down. It’ll be a beautiful big spectacle.

But as time went on thieves have taken more and more of them in recent years

But today the thieves have had their way and there are no bras to be seen at all

‘And that’s why we started this campaign on Facebook for people to send us their ‘pre-loved’ bras so we could get as many of them as possible.’

Ms Spaans also explained that many people hung bras on the fence because it meant something to them.

Members of the Facebook page have even offered a reward for anyone who can identify the thieves 

‘Visitors have come here and hung bras on the fence of their loved ones who may have passed away,’ she said. ‘It means these thieves are stealing something that has got a lot of sentimental value for someone. But the thieves don’t care about this at all.'

In the good old days you would be able to see bras all the way up the road

The site has been a controversial tourist attraction for years. It all began in 1999 when some passers-by began attaching bras to the fence – to this day no one knows why.

But it soon became very popular and over the years the bras hanging on the fence grew to hundreds. People from all over the world visiting New Zealand would go to the Cardrona Valley just to tie their bra to it.

However, the busty tourist attraction split locals. Some welcomed it as it brought tourists to the area and put the Cardrona Valley on the map. Others though, felt it was an eyesore and potential hazard to drivers using the road.

Many who hung bras on the fence did so because it held some sentimental value to them 

It was for this reason that in 2006, after discovering the fence rested on public road reserve, the local Council determined the bra fence was a ‘traffic hazard’ and ordered the bras to be removed from the fence.

In 2010 however, a layby was put in so tourists and visitors could safely pull over and take photographs. But in the past two years, the bra snatchers have returned with a vengeance, and Mrs Spaans wants to teach them a lesson.

Today there's nothing to be seen, but supporters say that is all going to change soon

‘They’re basically just spoilsports. I mean it’s pretty childish to resort to doing this. But it’s time we showed them that no matter what they do we won’t just sit back and let them away with it,’ she said.
