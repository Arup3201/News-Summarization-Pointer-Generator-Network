Real Madrid are confident of wrapping up a deal for Porto right back Danilo.

The Brazilian has been watched by all the top sides in Europe over the past season but Madrid have made a determined push to sign him over recent weeks.

The Spanish giants are now poised to agree a deal in the summer worth around £27million. 

Danilo, in action last month for Porto against Vitoria, is close to completing a £27million move to Real Madrid

Manchester United, City, Paris Saint-Germain, Bayern Munich and Barcelona have all been linked with a move, but the 23-year-old is keen on a move to the Bernabeu. 

Danilo's contract has 16 months left to run and Porto have made attempts to get him to agree a new deal.

However, his representatives met with Madrid officials last week and held further talks with Porto to underline the player's wish to leave.
