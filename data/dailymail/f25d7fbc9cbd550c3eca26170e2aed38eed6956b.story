'Tenacious': Daphne Smallman, of Solihull, West Midlands, who died of cancer aged 78 in February, stood up to Tesco over the pricing issue

Tesco has been fined £300,000 in a landmark court case after it misled thousands of shoppers with a bogus half-price strawberry promotion.

The supermarket admitted four offences linked to the sale of punnets of strawberries in 2,300 stores across the country at a ‘half-price’ figure of £1.99.

Britain’s biggest grocer used an original price of £3.99 to justify the bargain claim.

However, this higher figure only applied for a very short period.

Tesco has admitted the claims of big savings were misleading and it has now been fined £300,000 and ordered to pay £65,000 in costs.

The ruling will serve as a warning to all supermarkets, who stand accused of using a raft of underhand tactics to tempt shoppers through the doors.

Birmingham Crown Court heard that the half-price promotion was instrumental in generating strawberry sales of some £52million with a profit of £2.3million.

Judge Michael Chambers QC said: ‘The promotion was not a genuine bargain. It was false and misleading. The offer should never have been made in the first place by a national retailer. It was patently wrong.’ 

He said the case was ‘shocking by its very nature’ because consumers had a ‘high degree of trust’ in chains such as Tesco.

As a result, he decided to levy what is a very large fine in terms of trading standards law.

In court: Supermarket giant Tesco has been fined £300,000 for misleading the public over a half-price offer on punnets of strawberries

The case only reached the courts 
thanks to the tenacity of elderly shopper Daphne Smallman, who saw the 
strawberry bargain claims when in a Tesco at Sheldon, Birmingham, in the
summer of 2011.

It turned 
out that the £3.99 figure had applied for a very short period, however 
the half-price deal ran for a much longer 14 weeks through the summer.

This was at odds with guidelines in the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations Act 2008.

A
general rule of thumb is that an offer price should not carry on for a 
longer period than an item was sold at its full price.

Fined: The case concerned a Tesco store in Sheldon, Birmingham, after it was brought to trading standards officials' attention

Mrs Smallman 
understood that the original price of £3.99 might have been fair at the 
start of the strawberry season when the fruit was still in short supply.

Praise: Daphne Smallman's friend Sonia Lewis (pictured), 79, said the late campaigner 'would be pleased to know something had been done'

However, she knew it was 
unfair to keep using this high figure when strawberries were plentiful 
and farmers were supplying them at low prices.

It
is exactly this tactic that all of the supermarkets have used for years
to give the impression they are offering bargains on seasonal fruit and
vegetables. 

Mrs Smallman 
was identified in court as making the complaint, however, she died 
earlier this year, aged 78, before the case was resolved.

She
took up the matter with her local trading standards office which 
pursued the case to the point that Tesco felt it had no choice but to 
admit misleading shoppers.

Birmingham
council’s head of trading standards, Sajeela Naseer, stressed the 
ruling was significant for the way products were promoted in future.

‘Food pricing, presentation and the depiction of promotional practices 
is a crucial issue for retailers, and in turn, consumers.’

Tesco
had tried to kill off the prosecution earlier this year by arguing that
Birmingham council did not have the power to pursue a case involving 
offences outside its borders.

Yesterday,
however the store admitted its guilt, although it insisted the 
misleading promotion was the result of a one-off human error, rather 
than a wider attempt to deceive customers.

A
store spokesman said: ‘We sell over 40,000 products in our stores, with
thousands on promotion at any one time, but even one mistake is one too
many.
