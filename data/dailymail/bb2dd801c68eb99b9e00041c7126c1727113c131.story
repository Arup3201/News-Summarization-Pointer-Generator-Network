TV show Undercover Boss has caused outrage among viewers after it featured a sports bar where the CEO fired a bartender for refusing to wear just her bikini top on camera and gave a waitress a 'work incentive' of free implants.

Sunday night's episode focused on Bikinis Sports Bar and Grill, an establishment which prides itself on waitresses and bartenders who dress in bikini tops, jean shorts and cowboy boots and is a trademarked 'breastaurant'. 

CEO Doug Guller disguised himself to go undercover at one restaurant of his chain which has several locations in Texas, Oklahoma and North Carolina. 

Guller has said that his restaurant focuses on four things - booze, food, sports and sex - and boasted that makes it 'recession-proof'.

Waitress Gracie, 23, won her boss's approval and was offered free breast implants if she keeps up the good work and enthusiastic attitude for six months

On the show, Guller analyzed his employees' skills and hard work - before firing one who refused to wear only a bikini top while being filmed and offering a boob job to another staffer who impressed him. 

As a 'new employee' , Guller shadowed bartender Jessica and admitted he was 'p*****' to find she has chosen to wear a T-shirt while being filmed instead of her bikini top because she didn't feel comfortable.

'That's not what we do here at Bikinis,' Guller added. 'We wear bikinis, jean shorts, and cowboy boots.'

The CEO went undercover at his sports bar dressed in jeans and a T-shirt. 

Jessica also confided that she was looking for a new job but was bar-tending to support herself as she was a logistics expert who lost her job when her old company went bankrupt.

Guller ultimately fires Jessica at the end of the episode for not wearing her bikini and lacking in enthusiasm - but not before offering to put a good word in for her with other employers.

Next up was waitress Gracie, 23, an employee who was fired four time times in the past three years but whose enthusiasm nevertheless impressed the bar owner.

Culler gently chided Gracie for checking her phone at work - before offering her the incentive of a free boob job if she promised not to text at work and keep up the chipper attitude for the next six months.

Following his starring reality TV role, Guller tweeted: 'Thank you very much #undercoverboss. Many thanks to Chris George & the Bikinis team, ya'll rock! #BikinisSportsBarAndGrill #eatwithyoureyes.' 

CBS seemed equally pleased with Sunday's episode of Undercover Boss, sharing multiple tweets including: 'What a wonderful moment on #UndercoverBoss! #TryNotToCry' and 'Do you think Grace will make the perfect bikini babe? #UndercoverBoss'.A

Dozens of fans posted comments following the airing. Jon Rojas tweeted: 'Hey @CBS @undercover_cbs, this a joke, right? #UndercoverBoss Someone at CBS needs to be fired #OutofTouch'

Hannah D. Shatinsky commented: 'It's one thing for a close minded man like @DougGuller but I expected better from CBS.' 

Paul Butterworth added: '@undercover_cbs Sexism? misogyny? patriarchal oppression of women?' 

Eric Iverson wrote: '@DougGuller Rather than calling you names, I called your Arlington location and told the woman who answered that she deserved better.'

MailOnline was awaiting a comment from CBS today.
