They climbed from the ashes to honour those lost on September 11.

New York firefighters joined hundreds of fundraisers scaling the 72 floors of 4 World Trade Center in aid of charity.

More than 700 took part in the inaugural Runyon Up event, raising $170,000 for the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation.

Returning to the World Trade Center site was particularly poignant for Captain Ray Farrell of the Fire Department of New York's Ladder 43 in East Harlem.

'We climbed from the ashes to honour those lost': More than 700 people including dozens of New York and New Jersey firefighters took part in the inaugural Runyon Up run, scaling 72 floors of 4 World Trade Center for charity

Participants had the option of racing to the 72nd floor or completing a partial run to the 54th floor

The event, which took place on Thursday, raised more than $170,000 for the Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation

Returning to the World Trade Center site was particularly poignant for Captain Ray Farrell of the Fire Department of New York's Ladder 43 in East Harlem. The 53-year-old made the climb with a few of the men from his company. 'We climbed from ashes, here we are,' the 25-year veteran said

Elite climbers were the first to take on the challenge, leading the pack, with the fastest male contender reaching the 72nd floor in under nine minutes

'We do it as a tribute to those who were lost in the Sept. 11 attacks', said Sean Smith, 22, who completed the climb wearing 68 pounds of equipment. He was one of dozens of firefighters who took part in the run

A crew of firefighters from New Jersey took on the climb in full gear.

'We
 do it as a tribute to those who were lost in the September 11 attacks', 
said Sean Smith, 22, who completed the climb wearing 68 pounds of equipment.

He has been a firefighter for five years in Lebanon, N.J.

Tim Donahue (pictured) was the first man to reach the 72nd floor, making the climb in just under 9 minutes. He said: 'It's striking how new this building is. It's like an unused baseball glove. It's missing the cigarette butts and gum stains.' The 44-year-old New York City teacher does several tower climbs a year

The first woman was Shari Klarfeld, 33, of Plainview, made it across the finishing line in just over 11 minutes

Hundreds of runners, including some as young as 14 completed the challenge

The building, part of a complex still under construction to replace the towers destroyed in the 2001 terrorist attacks, is so new that the floors climbers finished on were still unfinished

'It's striking how new this building is.
 It's like an unused baseball glove,' Mr Donahue said. 'It's missing the
 cigarette butts and gum stains.'

The building, part of a complex still under construction to replace the towers destroyed in the 2001 terrorist attacks, is so new that the floors climbers finished on were still unfinished.

The event raised more than $170,000, said Lorraine Egan, foundation president and chief executive.

She said the organization hopes to repeat the event next year.

Asked if organizers considered trying to move it to 1 World Trade Center, she said it wasn't something they had spoken to anyone about, but added: 'I would love that'.

Tower climbs are held in high-profile buildings around the world, including the Empire State Building.

The event on Thursday was sanctioned, unlike a recent spate of unauthorized visits by thrill-seekers to the site.

Sixteen-year-old Justin Casquejo, of Weehawken, N.J., was arrested last month after getting through a hole in the fence surrounding the 104-story 1 World Trade Center and taking the elevator to the spire.

A judge has ordered Casquejo to be assessed in a program for youthful offenders. He faces charges including criminal trespass.

In September, three people parachuted from the building, producing a video of their jump.

When the first visitors make their way through the doors of the National September 11 Memorial and Museum next month they will be confronted with a stark wall bearing a dedication to all those who lost their lives that day.

On the wall, which stands in front of a repository containing about 8,000 remains from the 2,749 victims, is the quotation: 'No day shall erase you from the memory of time. Virgil.'

The seemingly poignant sentiment spans 60 feet and each of the 15inch letters is made from Twin Towers steel.

Directors of the museum say the quote 'speaks to the indelibility of our memories'.

But the choice of quotation has sparked controversy just weeks before the opening.

The line comes from the ninth book of the Aeneid. It refers to two Trojan soldiers Nisus and Euryalus, who raid their enemy's camp at night, slaughtering sleeping soldiers in an orgy of violence. For this, the enemy kill them as they try to flee, impaling their heads on spears.

'If we take into account its original context, the quotation is more applicable to the aggressors in the 9/11 tragedy than to those honored by the memorial,' Helen Morales, a classics professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara told The New York Times.

'So my first reaction is that the quotation is shockingly inappropriate for the U.S. victims of the 9/11 attack.'

Museum director Alice Greenwald said the quote was selected for the reference to one day, rather than the narrative of the classic story.

She said: 'What resonated with us, and with everyone who reviewed its use in the context of the museum, was the reference to a single day not being able to erase the memory of those we love.'
