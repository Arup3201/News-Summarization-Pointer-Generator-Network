Ride-sharing giant Uber is testing a new, exclusive - and more expensive - car service in a little city that could - Los Angeles.

The company announced this week that UberLUX is now active for clients in Tinseltown, promising to bring a 'luxurious experience'.

The offering involves rides in high-end vehicles, such as Tesla Model S, Mercedes Benz S-Class or BMW 7-Series, from Uber's top-rated drivers.

The option appears to be the first step of an expansion, with plans to take Uber from a taxi alternative into a limousine service.

Lux: The service promises only high-end vehicles, like Mercedes, and drivers that are top-rated

Clients eligible for the new service were alerted by email from the company on Thursday, according to The Hollywood Reporter.

It was also announced on their website's blog.

UberLUX comes at a price, however.

The base fare of a regular ride - Uber Black-  is $8, with a minimum price of $15.

The minimum fare of an UberLUX ride is $30.  

The service has been trialed in other cities around the world as part of a pop-up feature.

L.A. is the first though to officially have it.

It will eventually be available to all people in the city, not just select clients. 

Key market: UberLUX has been tested in cities all over, but Los Angeles was the ideal starting platform

Uber has come under fire in recent weeks on different fronts.

Last month, executive Emil Michael said at a New York dinner party that the company should spend 'a million dollars' hiring a team to 'dig up dirt' on journalists who report unfavorably about Uber.

The company was then forced to overhaul and upgrade their security operations after several female passengers reported being raped by Uber drivers. 

Driver Alejandro Done, 46,  pleaded not guilty on Wednesday in Cambridge District Court to charges of rape and kidnapping, allegedly assaulting a woman he was driving phone on the backseat of his car.

A total of four women in Boston have come forward claiming they were assaulted by drivers, not specifically Done. 

This week, during a siege in Sydney, Australia that saw the city go into lockdown, Uber was accused of upping its minimum fare to $100 amid a major demand for cars during the hostage crisis. 

In September 2012, Uber changed its charge policy so that it could adapt to busy periods.

'The system determines or approximates an amount of available service providers for providing the service at the given time,' the patent application reads, according to The Huffington Post.

reads. 

'Based on the determined amount of requesters and the determined amount of available service providers, the system adjusts a price, relative to a default price, for using the service provided by one or more service providers.'

It is not illegal to adapt a service cost based on demand.

However critics argue that, while hotels and airlines do such a thing regularly, Uber is the unique situation of being able to call in more drivers.
