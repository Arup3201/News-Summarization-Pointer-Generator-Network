Irate parents have confronted Myleene Klass in the playground at her daughter's private school after she mocked them online in a  row over donations towards birthday gifts.

The DJ and musician was harangued by other middle-class mothers on the school run who accused her 'betraying' them by leaking private emails online.

Miss Klass, 36, had revealed a parent had asked  others to donate a 'suggested £10' to buy their children birthday gifts, including a Kindle, and leave the cash in the child's school bag.

But when she arrived to pick up  daughter Ava, seven, from her school in north London yesterday  afternoon the broadcaster was berated by mothers who said her criticism was a 'cheap-shot'.

Joke: Myleene Klass, left  today, and right with her childre, mocked parents at her daughter's school for soliciting donations towards children's birthday presents - but has been berated by other parents

A fellow parent, whose daughter was the subject of the email, called across the playground to her: 'Why did you do it, Myleene? Why?'

Miss Klass then shouted back: 'If you've got a problem with it, talk to me in private.'

Other furious parents have written and emailed the headteacher of the £5,000-a-term school accusing her of using the personal emails of fellow parents to get press attention.

'It was a very distasteful and cheap shot,' wrote one.

One furious mother, who asked not to be named, said: 'She has betrayed our confidences and belittled us so publicly. Lots of people have complained.'

Another said: 'It is so out of order. She isn't going to have any friends left.'

Another defended the present arrangement saying: 'It is to make it easier for parents so they don't buy expensive presents that nobody wants.

'There is no obligation. Myleene has misunderstood the school's community spirit.'

Many are baffled why the star would tweet the emails over a year after they were sent.

One said: 'It is bang out of order. These are old class emails from a year ago.'

The emails posted by Miss Klass did not have dates on them but stated the party is due to take place on February 9th.

Last night several parents claimed they were a year old. Today Miss Klass did not drop her daughter at school. 

Mockery: Ms Klass posted the text of two emails she received from fellow parents, as well as her response

Problems began after 36-year-old Miss Klass, the former pop star turned Classic FM presenter, posted on social media two emails she had received 'from some school mums', after first changing the names.

Gift-giving has become a big business in many top private schools as parents vie to curry favour with teachers.

Tatler magazine reported last year that some teachers had been given presents as lavish as £1,000 handbags, diamond necklaces and cases of vintage wine.

At one school, parents even offered teachers the chance to use their private jet.

A mother at a London prep school said that she was emotionally blackmailed into donating £90 - the minimum amount acceptable - to a fund for teachers' gifts.

Some schools have had to introduce new rules capping the value of presents teachers can accept - at Stowe, for example, staff must declare any gifts above £50

The first email read: 'Jane and Hannah would prefer a class birthday gift for their daughters this year. Sarah would like a Kindle and Lola a desk (very studious choices!) so if you would like to join in, please can I collect a suggested £10 from you before the party on February 9.

'If you prefer to send £ via an envelope in your daughters [sic] school bag, marked for Jane/me that works too. I will pass on a voucher and card to each at the party. Thanx [sic] and no obligation of course.'

A second email from another parent who offers to collect the cash reiterates that £10 would be a 'popular amount' to contribute – meaning that the total value of the gifts would be at least £200 – but adds: 'Feel free to give what you like or indeed, to give your own gift.'

Shortly after, Miss Klass published her stinging reply in which she said she was collecting 'unicorn money' towards a 'real, live unicorn' for Ava.

Warming to her theme, she added: 'I'd like a Ferrari and Leonardo DiCaprio, so by all means, do feel obligated to contribute to this too.'

And making it clear she thought the original request was bad manners, she ended her retort by saying the money could be donated to a fictitious site – www.getwhatyoure-givenandendthismadness.com. 

Mother: Ms Klass was making fun of parents whose children attend the same school as her daughter Ava

Miss Klass, who lives in North London, entitled her reply 'Let's put the fun back into Bdays!' and shared it with her 459,200 followers on Twitter and 75,000 on Instagram.

Hours later, she was confronted in the playground as she picked up Ava from her school. 

On parenting website Mumsnet, opinion was divided. One wrote: 'Well good on her for shaming these grabby idiots. It's crass and rude to ask for money instead of a gift.'

Another posted: 'One of the mums asked to do this at our school! I think it's so rude!'

But others sided with the parents asking for money. One wrote: 'What's wrong with asking for contributions towards a larger present? It seems much more sensible than getting 30 presents which you have to find room for and may not be played with.'

A spokesman for Miss Klass, who also has a three-year-old daughter, Hero, declined to comment.
