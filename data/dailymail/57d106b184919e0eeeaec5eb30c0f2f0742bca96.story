Hayley Jones, 34, has been given another suspended sentence after a judge heard she has been binge-drinking since she was just eight years old

But she soon got drunk again and in August launched a vicious attack on a policeman who arrested her for brawling in the street with another woman.

During the incident Jones shouted: 'Why me ? You should be taking her, you b***h,' referring to the other woman as she was being spoken to by an officer.

She then repeatedly kicked PC Gavin Entwistle as he tried to shut her inside a police van.

Burnley Crown Court heard Jones had a 'significant record' for assault with other previous convictions for common assault from 1998 and 2002 and possessing an offensive weapon in 2003.

She admitted being drunk and disorderly, assault on police and breaching a suspended term.

Last December Jones was in court over an attack on chip shop owner Paulos Iasonides. 

The court heard she was so angry about her portion of potato scallops she lunged at Mr Iasonides, clamped her teeth around his arm - and then clung on for around 40 seconds while he tried to shake her off.

During the violent struggle, Jones also used her nails to scratch behind 67-year old Mr Iasonides' ear and draw blood and also kicked him. 

She also tried to force her way behind the counter at Reedley chippy in Brierfield towards the till but he managed to block her - fearing she might grab a knife to stab him.

Recorder Roger Farley said he fully accepted Jones had 'a chaotic and troubling background'

The victim's wife Hariklitsa, 59, who was running a hairdressers upstairs, heard screaming and shouting and came downstairs to help her husband restrain Jones and eject her from the shop. 

Police found the her  pacing up and down outside the shop screaming and shouting at her victim. 

Mr Iasonides who is now scarred for life later told police: 'She was like a mad person. She was like a wolf.'

Jones avoided jail after a judge decided to give her a chance to 'break her cycle of alcohol abuse.'

But last August Jones was on a drunken night out with friends when she got involved in a bust up with a group of people.

Lisa Worsley, prosecuting, said police were called to reports of a fight on Commercial Street at 1.15am. 

The court heard Jones was agitated, shouting loudly and a number of people were concerned about her behaviour. 

Ms Worsley said Jones, who was in a rage, was arrested but began to struggle and was handcuffed and put in the back of a van. 

She lashed out with her feet, striking the officer on the chest and thigh. 

She blocked the cage door with her feet, lay on her back with her feet in the air and kicked the officer again.

Jones was eventually stopped from striking out and the officer was eventually able to close the van door.

In mitigation defence lawyer Laura Barbour said : 'She began drinking alcohol when she was eight. 

'Drink is something that's been a feature not only in her her adult life - but the majority of her life.' 

She said Jones had tried very hard to fight her addiction.

She added : 'She hasn't been entirely successful, but she is making progress.'

Jones was given eight weeks in custody, suspended for a year, to run consecutively to her previous suspended sentence of 44 weeks in prison suspended for two years.

Passing sentence the judge Recorder Roger Farley, QC, said he fully accepted Jones had has a chaotic and troubling background. 

Andrew Langford, chief executive of the British Liver Trust, said they do occasionally hear of cases where youngsters have started drinking at eight or nine.

He said: 'More often we hear of 12 or 13 year olds binge-drinking, but this woman is certainly not the only one - it does happen.

'I think drinking from that early of an age will have definitely had some effect on her liver.

'Drinking large amounts from a young age will increase her risk of quite a lot of different cancers, as alcohol is a carcinogen.

'She should be worried. Unfortunately, the younger people start drinking, the more likely it is to damage the liver and body.

'She should ask her GP to screen her for liver disease.

'She may well have some form of liver disease from drinking at such a young age, as well as increasing her risk from cancers.'
