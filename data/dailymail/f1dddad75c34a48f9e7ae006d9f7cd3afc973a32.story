At 8.30am on a Saturday, you would expect to find most children in front of the TV with a bowl of cornflakes, or in bed.

Instead, 12-year-old Hannah Whiterow is dashing up a sizeable hill in Highgate Wood, North London, being timed with a stopwatch by her personal trainer.

She has already done an arduous mini-circuit, involving push-ups, squats, lunges, knee-lifts and some serious grappling with a TRX suspension training device hooked to a trees to build up her core strength.

By the end, Hannah, who is 5 ft 5 in and weighs a trim 8 stone 2 lbs, is sweaty and exhausted. Her mother, Rosie Whiterow, 48, is thrilled. This is because trainer Hilary Burbridge has managed what Rosie has been failing to do for some time: coax her daughter off the sofa and into a pair of running shoes.

'Hannah does an hour of PE a week at school and was at the age when she wasn't interested in going to the playground,' says Rosie. 'Instead, she wants to listen to music, talk to friends on her phone, or watch TV. I was worried about her becoming a couch potato. She wasn't overweight, but I was concerned she wasn't moving.'

Hannah is typical of this generation of children who, this week, were called 'the least active generation in history' by 2012 Olympic organiser, Lord Sebastian Coe.

This was on the back of a new parliamentary report, which found half of children aged seven don't exercise enough, and will live shorter lives as a result.

While Coe is calling for 'breakfast fitness clubs', so pupils exercise before the day starts, mothers like Rosie are outsourcing the problem, paying up to £200 a month to enlist a personal trainer.

Instead of turning off the TV and organising a trip to the park, the modern solution for time-stretched parents is to employ someone to do their nagging for them.

Rosie, who works full-time in publishing, heard about Hilary through other parents and signed Hannah up for the classes. 'I wanted to encourage her to stay fit and healthy, but in a positive way, rather than telling her constantly that she'd be fat if she kept eating biscuits,' says Rosie.

'Hilary's sessions seemed perfect. Some Saturdays, Hannah is reluctant, but when she gets going, she loves it. She's been having sessions once a week for 18 months and is incredibly fit. On a recent break to Devon I was in awe of how she climbed a steep hill without getting out of breath.

'It's inspired Hannah to take responsibility for her health. She's now walking part of her way to school, instead of taking the bus.'

With the report claiming just half of seven-year-olds meet government recommendations of an hour's moderate to vigorous physical activity a day, with activity levels halving again between ages nine and 15, it's little wonder middle-class parents like Rosie are turning to experts.

Figures from the Office for National Statistics reveal that 28 per cent of children aged two to 15 are obese, and increasing reliance on iPods, iPads and mobiles for entertainment is a big contributing factor.

Worrying projections suggest that, without effective intervention, six out of ten children will be dangerously overweight by 2050. Hilary, 52, has about 20 children on her books, most around Hannah's age or younger, each paying £5 for an hour-long session. She qualified as a trainer three years ago, after a career as a business development consultant. As a mum to a ten-year-old son and 13-year-old daughter, she saw the need for her services.

'State schools don't have the resources to do a lot of sport, so parents are looking for alternatives,' says Hilary. 'The children may moan at the start, especially if it's cold or raining, but they're with friends, and end up having a laugh. There's a real sense of achievement at the end.'

Natacha Osorio, 51, from London, hired Hilary in response to 12-year-old daughter Mariana's sedentary lifestyle. Her son, Pablo, 14, plays a lot of sport, but finding a sport Mariana enjoyed was more tricky.

'She refuses to walk to school and I worried about how little exercise she was doing,' says Natacha. 'When we went shopping, she'd lag behind and I'd have to nag her to keep up.'

Mariana, who is 5 ft 2 in and weighs 7 stone 7lb, says her enjoyment of the sessions depends on her mood, but she loves the hill dash 'as it's made my legs so much stronger'.

Isn't enlisting a personal trainer just another way for harried parents to palm responsibility off to hired help? What happened to a family game of rounders in the park?

Hilary worries about this, too. 'So much of how children progress is to do with parents' influence. They have to project the right image and be active,' she says. 'But parents are living high-pressure lives and feel guilty about not doing as much exercise with their family as they'd like. That's where I step in.'

Across the UK, CrossFit - which offers high intensity strength and conditioning circuit classes for adults - has spawned a junior version, CrossFit Kids, which is attracting parents in droves.

Sarah Dawes-Clark, 40, a manager from Cardiff, has been sending her son James, nine, and daughter Lucy, ten, to Sean Allen's CrossFit Kids classes once a week for the past six months, paying £5 a time, and has hired Sean to top Lucy up with an extra weekly one-on-one session, at £30 an hour.

'I probably spend around £200 a month on their fitness,' says Sarah. 'It's worth it as it is setting them up with skills to keep healthy for life.'

Sarah, a fit size six, and husband Andrew are into CrossFit themselves, and do five classes a week.

'James and Lucy were only doing two PE sessions a week at school. Even then, it was the first class to be dumped if they had a special assignment or presentation,' says Sarah.

In a normal 45-minute session, Sean, 31, does squats, deadlifts, press-ups, sit-ups and box-jumps, all of which are scaled, according to a child's weight and ability.

A former primary school teacher, he earns about £210 a week from his young clientele, seeing about five children one-to-one, and running a weekly CrossFit Kids and Teens class, with ten to 12 children in each. And the interest is growing.

'Teenage girls are often sent to me because they've put on a bit of weight and want to lose it,' says Sean. 'One young client was thrilled because she dropped a dress size.

'When they first come, they struggle to hold a squat for more than 30 seconds. As the weeks go on, they can hold the positions for longer.'

The problem, according to Sean, is that schools are geared towards traditional or competitive sports, and some children lose interest.

Since going to his sessions, Sean has seen a big change in Lucy. ‘She's a quiet girl, but when we do the session, she comes alive,' he says.

Sarah agrees: 'Lucy, who is 4 ft 5 in and weighs 5 stone 1 lb, is always buzzing after her sessions, telling me how many pull-ups or box-jumps she did, and how much stronger and more confident she feels.'

All this after-school activity does eat away at Sarah's time with her children. 'I have to fight the guilt,' she says. 'I worry we're not spending as much time as a family, or one-to-one, as I'd like. But then, I see how much the children benefit.'

Adrian Voce, campaigner and former director of Play England, which campaigns for greater provision of childhood play, is less enthusiastic. 'This seems a sad indictment of the modern world,' he says.

'Given the freedom to play outdoors, children will get the physical exercise they need. Children of all ages should be able to play out near their homes naturally. Parents shouldn't have to resort to paying to get their kids to exercise.'
