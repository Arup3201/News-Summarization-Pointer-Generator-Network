Frank Lampard has been admiring the scenery of New York during the international break as he prepares for his highly anticipated move to the city's football team and Major League Soccer on July 1.

The attacking midfielder will  join up with New York City after Manchester City's Premier League season finishes and he has been taking time to get used to his new home city while the club season pauses for Euro 2016 qualifiers and international friendlies.

Lampard uploaded a picture to his Facebook account posing with the city providing a spectacular backdrop after going for a jog alongside fiancee Christine Bleakley.

Former Chelsea man Lampard had the chance to see his team in action for the first time when New York played Sporting Kansas City on Saturday at Yankee Stadium.

But his side could not give him an early welcome present. In the absence of striker David Villa, who was injured, New York fell to a 1-0 home defeat, their first loss of the season.

Lampard will return to Premier League action when Manuel Pellegrini's side head to Selhurst Park to play Crystal Palace on April 6.
