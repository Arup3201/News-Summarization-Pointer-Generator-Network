A Banksy mural of a woman staring at an empty plinth has been vandalised with a spray-painted image of a penis. 

The piece, which appeared in Payers Park in Folkestone, Kent, just two weeks ago, is the latest of the artist's works to have been defaced. 

Titled Art Buff, it depicts an elderly woman wearing headphones while staring at an empty plinth with her hands behind her back, and is worth an estimated £300,000.

Art Buff in Folkestone, Kent,  was defaced by vandals who drew a penis onto the perspex glass protecting the painting 

The artwork appeared in the seaside town just two weeks ago and praised by excited local people 

Vandals have painted a penis over the protective perspex glass which keeps the original painting from being destroyed. 

The offensive image has been removed from the artwork, though Kent Police are investigating the incident. 

A Shepway District Council spokesman said they were working with officers to determine what happened.  

'Despite the unconventional way in which it appeared, Art Buff by Banksy is considered by many to be a valuable cultural addition to Folkestone.

'It has been attracting visitors to the town ever since it was discovered at the end of September.

Shepway District Council officers are working with the police who are investigating the incident.'

Upon its completion, Dreamlands Arcade, who own the building on which it appeared, employed security guards to watch over the valuable artwork, but they are not thought to have been working when it was vandalised. 

Art Buff is the latest of Banky's works to have been defaced. Following a residency in New York last year a handful of his pieces were tarnished by other graffiti artists, while others applied paint strip to murals in the UK. 

One of his most popular pieces, Spy Booth, has been totally destroyed after pub-goers used strip to ruin the faces of the three men in trench-coats depicted outside the phone box in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire.

Spy Booth, one of his most popular works in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, was also destroyed by vandals 

The artwork was ruined with grey graffiti before other vandals used paint strip to distort the faces of the men

This mural of a child drawing a robot was defaced by vandals at a hotel in Torquay, Devon 

Later a group of graffiti artists ruined it further by painting words in grey paint over the piece. 

Another which appeared on the wall of a hotel in Torquay, Devon, depicting a boy drawing a robot was obliterated with paint stripper. 

Banksy, who is famously anonymous, has not spoken out against vandals who paint over his work. 

Residents in Folkestone spoke out their disappointment on social media today, with one writing: 'Dont take long in folkestone for the wrongens to come out and ruin something (sic)'. 

Another said: 'It was only a matter of time before someone tried to ruin the Banksy'.
