A vicar has been arrested over claims he stole money from hundreds of grieving families, reports today suggest. 

Simon Reynolds, 50, is alleged to have taken money set aside by about 700 bereaved families to pay for funerals of their loved ones. It is claimed he took the money while based at All Saints church near Barnsley, South Yorkshire.

According to the Sunday Mirror, one of the funerals the vicar allegedly stole from was for a Territorial Army soldier killed in Afghanistan.

Reverend Reynolds, who has since moved 
to St Andrew's Church in Farnham, Surrey, was arrested following a 
four-month investigation into his finances.

He was then questioned by detectives before being released on bail pending further investigations, police have said.

The vicar has been suspended from his role at the Surrey church and his parishioners have been told.

One churchgoer from the Barnsley church told Lewis Panther at The Mirror: 'Is it the talk of the parish and about time it came out.

'It seems to me the church has tried to hush things up.'

They added a potential financial problem had been flagged up to the church in October, but bosses had waited until now to confirm the revelations.

A Diocese of Wakefield spokesperson confirmed the vicar's arrestand said they were working in 'close cooperation' with both the Diocese of Guildford and South Yorkshire Police.
