Brendan Rodgers has admitted that Liverpool are struggling to overcome the loss of Luis Suarez to Barcelona in the summer but insisted that it is just a 'short-term hit' to the club's ambitions.

The Reds manager has given a stunning interview to Spanish newspaper AS, in which he reveals that he hopes to manage in Spain and that he's already learning Spanish.

Rodgers also said that the club had been on a 'magic carpet ride' since he took the reins at Anfield in June 2012 but that the loss of Suarez has stopped the development of his side.

Brendan Rodgers has given a wide-ranging interview with Spanish newspaper AS, published on Monday - the translation of the quote on the front page says: 'I've not seen a team like this Madrid for a long time'

* Rodgers: I want to manage in Spain one day... and I'm already learning Spanish from Liverpool players! 

* Ronaldo and Bale are so fast they could run in the Olympic 100m final! 

But while Rodgers conceded that Liverpool are stuttering, the 41-year-old Northern Irishman also insisted that the club's long-term plans for growth are on course and pleaded for patience as he rebuilds a side without Suarez.

'The last 18 months we have been on a magic carpet ride of development but we still have a lot of growth to make,' Rodgers told AS. 'The natural progression of the team, probably in the summer, has been challenged.

'We obviously lost a world-class player but our challenge now is to progress. It will be slow but steady and that will always be the best way to get to where we want to.'

Suarez inspired Liverpool to an unlikely challenge for the Barclays Premier League title last season before he bit Italy defender Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup and picked up a lengthy suspension which he carried over to Catalonia.

The loss of Suarez has led to an overhaul of the squad, with the £75million banked from the striker's sale helping towards a £100m-plus splurge on the squad. Mario Balotelli, Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert, Emre Can, Lazar Markovic, Dejan Lovren, Alvaro Moreno and Divock Origi (back at Lille on loan) have all been brought in, but none of the new signings can yet be considered anything like a success at Anfield. 

Liverpool have failed to match the standards set last season, due in part to injury suffered by Suarez's strike partner Daniel Sturridge, and are already nine points behind league leaders Chelsea. There are also serious concerns about the form of Suarez's replacement, Balotelli, who has scored just once for his new club and put in another dismal performance during Sunday's scrappy 3-2 win at QPR.

Rodgers insisted that when he moved to Anfield he had been set a target of challenging for the title within three years and 'restoring Liverpool to what it had been' at home and in Europe, meaning he was ahead of schedule in just missing out to Manchester City by two points last season.

The latest test for Rodgers comes in the form of European champions Real Madrid, who visit Anfield on Wednesday night in the Champions League. 

'It’s an exciting time at Liverpool with lots of young players coming in,' said Rodgers. 'But if we are going to get better, we are going to take the short-term hit at the moment knowing that in the long-term the club will be better for it.'

Rodgers also tipped Suarez to be a 'big success' at Barcelona, saying: 'He will succeed.'

'I built my team around Luis,' he added. 'We helped improve his game and he also helped our team.'
