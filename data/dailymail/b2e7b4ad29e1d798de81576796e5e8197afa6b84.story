He may be retired, but basketball great Dikembe Mutombo still doesn't like to be dunked on.

The former Denver Nuggets All-Star center was on hand last night to watch his old team take on the Los Angeles Clippers.

During halftime, the Congo native was enlisted by Rocky, the Nuggets's mascot, to help entertain the crowd. It's probably a decision the popular lion regrets.

As Mutombo stood near the basket holding a ball over his head, Rocky ran toward him, preparing to dunk off a trampoline.

But Mutombo snatched the ball away at the final moment, sending Rocky crashing under the net.

As if the humiliation of defeat wasn't bad enough, Mutombo turned to the lion and issued his trademark finger-wag. The crowd loved it.

Larry Brown Sports reported that Denver honored Mutumbo and their 1993-94 team for a 20th anniversary celebration last night.
