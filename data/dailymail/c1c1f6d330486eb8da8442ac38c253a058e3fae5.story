Impending Hurricane Irene has put the dampeners on the the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial dedication with the event having to be postponed until September or October.

The organisers of the ceremony, which will see the 30ft statue of the late civil rights leader unveiled in Washington DC, announced said they had made the decision in the interests of public safety.

The hurricane which has been battering the Bahamas and Florida is expected to hit the east coast cities of Boston, New York and Philadelphia throughout the weekend and into Monday.

Around 300,000 people had been expected to turn up to the unveiling on Sunday following five days of celebration.

Organisers hope to have the memorial open for Friday and Saturday but said the official dedication, which
was due to coincide with 48th anniversary of the famous black leader's 
‘I Have a Dream' speech, would have to be postponed.

The opening gala event, at which Preisdent Obama gave a speech, was 
moved to the Washington Convention Center after the National Building 
Museum suffered damage in Tuesday’s earthquake.

The general public can only visit the new
memorial in Washington D.C. today until 10pm local time before the

site.

An interfaith service for 3,000 people is also scheduled for Saturday to mark the opening of the memorial - and that has had to be moved from the Washington National Cathedral .

The earthquake cracked spires 300ft above ground so the event will instead be held at the Basilica of the National Shrine, reported the Washington Post.

The formal dedication of the memorial is scheduled for 11am Sunday and event organisers say the venue of the ceremony, which is expected to be attended by President Obama, cannot be moved.

This weekend, many people who worked 
alongside Mr King in the struggle for justice and equality for black 
Americans plan to come together again to dedicate the monument built in 
his honour.

Five years ago, U.S. Representative John Lewis, Rev Young and Rev Jackson broke down in tears as they helped break ground on what would become the memorial on on a cold November day.

'All of us had been to jail, all of us had lived under the threat of violence. We all had that acute sense of social justice. None of us had life insurance, or a retirement plan. But we had each other. And we still do'

They mused together over their last staff meeting before they went to Memphis in April 1968, which would end in King's assassination.

The memory dredged up feelings no one else could fully share.

‘We just looked at each other,’ Rev Jackson said. ‘It was a different moment for us.’

He added: ‘All of us had been to jail, all of us had lived under the threat of violence.

‘We all had that acute sense of social justice. None of us had life insurance, or a retirement plan. But we had each other. And we still do.’
