Belgian police used water cannons and pepper spray to control thousands of protestors who flooded the streets of the capital as part of a demonstration by labour unions demanding a better deal for Europe's working men and women.

Demonstrators hurled oranges and cobblestones at police officers as the protest took hold of Brussels.

Thousands took part in the action, organised by the European Trade Union Confederation to oppose austerity measures implemented across the 28-country European Union.

Thousands of protestors took to the streets of Brussels today taking part in a demonstration by labour unions demanding a better deal for Europe's working men and women

Protestors voiced their opposition to social dumping, whereby businesses import cheaper workers to replace local hires or export jobs to a low-wage country or area.

The demonstration paralysed the traffic network in the capital and sent the U.S. Embassy into lockdown as the American ambassador to the EU, Anthony L. Gardner, was conducting an unrelated briefing for journalists.

Embassy staff said it was the first lockdown they could recall in years.

At one of the protest hot spots, near the European Union headquarters buildings, longshoremen from the Belgian cities of Antwerp and Ghent clashed with riot police.

Police said one demonstrator was hurt when a rock he was trying to throw hit him on the head instead. Several people were injured, including a policeman apparently struck by a cobblestone.

Organisers had expected 40,000 people to take part in the demonstration, but Brussels police spokeswoman Ilse Van de Keere estimated the turnout at about 25,000.
