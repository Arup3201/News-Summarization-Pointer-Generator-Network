Getting lost in a vast, maze-like shopping centre can turn a casual bit of retail therapy into something of a mission.

But help is on the way – in the form of a navigation system designed specially for shoppers.

The ‘shopnav’ system turns smartphones into miniature guides, leading users to the outlet they need via the quickest route.

The system downloads three dimensional plans from the internet - and 'guides' shoppers to their destinations inside shopping malls

There are several competing systems designed to prevent people being 'lost' indoors - Google and Nokia champion versions where wi-fi networks and mobile phone networks offer rough 'positioning', whereas Rosenberg's system relies on a sensor that works out how far a person has walked.

But the development raises privacy 
concerns. Armed with information about shoppers’ movements thanks to the
 IPS - indoor positioning systems -  stores could bombard them with offers tailored to them.

Engineers funded by the German government, have designed an interior GPS-style system that can be operated from an everyday smartphone.

Project manager Harald von Rosenberg got the idea from visiting a vast local 'megaplex shopping mall'.

He said: ‘I thought, 'wouldn't it be 
helpful if at such moments the smart phone could quickly shift to an 
interior space navigator and point the way through the rows of shops and
 stairwells.'‘

The project designed a chip able to 
register how fast and how far the user is walking - and work out direction, so it can offer precise 'navigation' information without having to contact a satellite, or even a mobile phone network.

It downloads three dimensional plans from the internet but can also work 'on the go' by scanning a QR code on the front entrance of a shopping mall or other building.

This approach would mean that the 'sat nav' doesn't need to connect to mobile networks while indoors - often difficult - to receive information.

QR codes, the small, square boxes of barcode-style patterns, are an increasingly popular way for companies to put out promotional information or a competition.

For this app, the code would include the layout design of a building, not just shops but a tourist attraction or an exhibition hall holding a trade fair for instance. The results are to be demonstrated at a technology fair and exhibition, in Germany, later this month which will unveil a tiny navigator chip the size of a fingernail.

This means one smartphone can be used by a number of different people without having to change the settings.

Von Rosenberg added: ‘There has never before been a device so small that can accomplish so much.’
