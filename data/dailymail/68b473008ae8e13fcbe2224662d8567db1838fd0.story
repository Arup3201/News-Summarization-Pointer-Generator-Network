Singer Cilla Black has criticised the club that made her famous, blaming it for damaging her hearing so badly that she has had a hearing aid surgically implanted.

The pop star turned presenter is in her 70s, but as a teenager in the 1960s she was a coat check girl in Liverpool's Cavern Club, working for tickets to watch bands like The Beatles perform.

Cilla told The Mail on Sunday: 'I blame the Cavern. All those years in a place with no proper acoustics, I think it may have done some damage.

'It's no fun getting older. I might be wearing beautiful diamond earrings but they can't take away the pain of losing my hearing. I think it's been a gradual thing... I didn't actually realise how bad it had got until I was with a friend in Barbados and I said to her, "Why are you whispering?"

She said to me, "Cilla I am not whispering, it is you who has a hearing problem."

'Its rock'n'roll that has done my hearing in. I went to the Cool Britannia party at 10 Downing Street and a well-known rocker came up to me and said something and I said, "I can't hear you." He replied, "I can't hear either."

He pointed out his hearing aid and told me to get one.

In an astonishingly frank admission Cilla, who was widowedÂ  in 1999 when husband Bobby Willis died of lung cancer, also admitted that growing old has left her feeling vulnerable and lonely.

She says she finds looking back so painful that she has been unable to bring herself to watch Cilla, a three-part ITV series about her life starring Sheridan Smith and co-produced by her son Robert, 43.

'I've had the films for three weeks now but I haven't been able to watch it even though my son is the co-producer.

'It's hard to watch your life unfold, and sad. Life changes. I haven't been in touch with Ringo and he turned 74 the other day, or Paul [McCartney].

'I wanted to see a new screening of the old Beatles film Hard Day's Night, and I wanted to go with Patti Boyd, but she was in New York and I didn't want to go on my own.'
