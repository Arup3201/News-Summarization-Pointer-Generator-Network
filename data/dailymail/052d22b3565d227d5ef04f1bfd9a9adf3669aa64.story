Students at a Californian high school are in shock after one of their classmates - a talented track star - jumped to his death from a pedestrian bridge near campus.

Some students at Otay Ranch High School in Chula Vista said Steven Liu, 17, had been bullied but friends claimed he suffered low self esteem and could be hard on himself, despite his many talents.

'Steven was a great guy,' his friend Jazmine
 Lahbabi told the San Diego Union Tribune at a makeshift memorial on the bridge on Sunday, but 'he had been asking his friends for 
the last couple of months what they thought of him. I 
think he was looking for help.'

Liu died after jumping from the Santa
 Venetia Street bridge on Friday evening. Passersby who witnessed the 
tragedy said the boy was crying on the ledge before falling to his 
death.

Tragic: 17-year-old Steven Liu, pictured left and right, jumped to his death from a bridge on Friday after his friends said he suffered from low self esteem and that he could be hard on himself

Aaron Bianco was driving past the bridge when he saw Liu about to jump, but said he was powerless to stop him. He rushed to help after seeing him fall.

'The
 police officer I was with started first aid immediately,' he told News 10. 'To 
be honest, it was obvious nothing was going to work.'

He
 added that Liu's mother, who had learned that her son was going to the bridge, arrived on the scene moments later and was 
'wailing on the ground'.

More than 100 people gathered at the memorial on Saturday night to remember Liu, who was a star runner on the cross-country team, a talented photographer, an origami artist and a budding guitar player. His coach said he regularly finished in the top three at the school's cross country meets.

Friends and strangers left posters, candles, letters, pictures and jerseys on the bridge.

Classmates wrote messages on Facebook and spoke to news channels explaining that the teenager took his life as he was the victim of bullying.

John Melgar, who ran track with Liu, said other students would call him names and harass him.

'People took advantage of him,' he told News 10. 'They'd always ask for things. 
They'd tell him like, "Oh, can you carry this for me" and he'd just 
carry it because he's a really nice guy.'

Adrian Agbuia added that his brother had been in class with Liu last week when he had a breakdown.

'He
 just finally lost it,' said Agbuia. 'All the bullying finally got to 
him and he was just banging his head against the door in the classroom.'

Remembered: On Saturday night, friends held a candle-lit memorial on the bridge for Liu

Loss: Friends described him as a talented track star and artist who was always willing to help others

But the school and other friends have expressed their skepticism over the claims he was bullied.

Cross-country coach Ian Cumming, who said he was close to the young athlete, told UT San Diego that the situation was a lot more complicated.

'I think people who are saying that don’t know him and don't know his personal situation,' he said.

'He
 was just a great person and had a lot of things going on, and like many
 teenagers he just didn’t have the same self image as was true about 
him.'

Manuel Rubio, a spokesman for the Sweetwater Union High School District said he was aware that students had said Liu had been bullied, but he could not confirm that was true.

'This is a student who had a lot of personal issues going on,' Rubio said.

His friend Jazmine said she was also 
doubtful that he had been bullied. Instead, she said Liu was competitive
 and could be hard on himself.

'We cared a lot for him and tried to show it, but sometimes he would shut it out,' she said.

A crisis counseling team that includes 
psychologists and administrators will be available at the high school to
 speak with students, officials said.
