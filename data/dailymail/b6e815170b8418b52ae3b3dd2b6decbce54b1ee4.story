A Chinese gangster who said being forced to leave his Christian retreat centre would 'devastate' him and a convicted Somalian sex attacker cannot be kicked out of Britain because of human rights laws.

Tsai Wang Chen, 39, has settled in a church community where he grows vegetables and looks after hens after being released from prison and argued it would breach his right to a private life if he was sent back.

And asylum seeker Ahmed Hersi, 26, cannot be deported because of civil war in his native Somalia - despite carrying out a sex attack after human rights rules stopped his deportation.

Chen won the right to stay in the UK after the Home Office blew thousands of pounds in an attempt to have him sent back to China.

The convicted criminal lives for free in Ministeracres, near Consett, in Northumberland and spends his looking after the hens and helping with the cleaning.

Chen was a 'snakehead' gangster - a group who are paid to smuggle people into the country - who was convicted of kidnap, false imprisonment and blackmail, the Daily Mirror reported.

The gangster and his three accomplices seized a man and demanded a ransom of £29,000 before they later released him.

He was locked up for six years by Judge Paul Clark at Oxford Crown Court in 1997 for the violent crime.

But after his release he has created a new life for himself at the sheltered Christian retreat centre.

Ministeracres is an 18th century Grade II mansion house set in idyllic countryside and is used by Christians as a place to escape and 'find healing and wholeness in their relationship with God, themselves, others and creation'.

Home Office officials negotiated with the Chinese to send Chen back but they were 'extremely reluctant' to have him. A note in their newsletter recently confirmed that Chen was free to stay in Britain.

It
said: 'During the past number of years Tsai Wang has been part of the 
community whilst attempts were made to persuade the Home Office to allow
him to stay in Britain.

'Recently these efforts were rewarded and Tsai received the good news that he has permission to stay here and make a new start.'

Immigration Judge Peter Lane ruled that kicking Chen out of the country would be in breach of Article 8 of human rights laws and the right to respect for private and family life.

'He has been out of detention for seven and a half years, forging the unusual but strong private life,' Judge Lane said, the Daily Mirror reported.

Chen told the hearing 'Since I came to Minsteracres, I have contributed to the life and work of the community. Ministeracres has given me a new life.'

The Chinese man won his battle in February and is staying at the retreat centre. However, he still has to report to police regularly.

Chen is the latest in a long line of convicted criminals to successfully use Human Rights laws to argue that deportation would breach their right to a private and family life.

Somalian sex offender Hersi has also been allowed to stay because of the risk to his safety if he is returned to his war torn homeland.

Still here: Ahmed Hersi who was told in 2007 that he would be deported to Somalia

The 26-year-old was placed on the sex offenders register for an assault 
committed after the European Court of Human Rights stopped his 
deportation from Britain

It
ruled the asylum seeker, who wears a Home Office tag on his ankle, 
cannot be sent back to his native country while civil war rages.

He has asked for a 'second chance' - and said he shouldn't be deported for making a mistake.

He
was jailed for three years in 2007 after being found guilty of a street
robbery but after a six-year legal battle he is still here.

He
has dubbed his treatment as inhuman and maintains our government will 
deliver a death sentence by deporting him to lawless Mogadishu.

Hersi,
from Small Heath, Birmingham said: 'I have been here since I was eight,
I can hardly speak Somalian. I don't remember my motherland. They'll 
see me as "this rich kid from England".

'I
have been placed in a box by the immigration department, a box that is 
on fire. I am being treated like a pet dog. If you tell a pet dog to 
stay in that room, it will stay in that room.'

Yet Hersi, who has a 20 strong family in Birmingham, has hardly been a model citizen.

As
a juvenile, he was twice placed on probation for shoplifting before 
receiving three years for street robbery. 'It was a stupid, irrational 
thing to do,' he said.

'It does not shine a good light on me, but I was high on cannabis.'

He was informed he was being kicked out of the UK while in prison - and has lost two appeals against the decision.

Hersi was told he must leave in 2007 but has appealed.

He was convicted of criminal damage in 2009 and jailed for 12 weeks in 2011 for a sexual assault.

But Hersi believes he is the victim. 'I am not trying to deny I have a criminal past,' he said.

'My
argument is, had I been given some form of access to do something 
productive when I was released things would have been different. I can't
even do voluntary work.

'There
were two co-defendants in the robbery case and they now have jobs, cars
and homes. I was not given that opportunity. I am 26 and my life is on 
hold. Yes, I made a mistake. Why was I not given the opportunity to 
repent?

'There are rapists and paedophiles being released and they are re-offending. How can I be deported for one mistake?'

Ahmed Hersi boasted about how he drunkenly begged a teenage girl on a bus for sex.

Hersi, who has never worked, said: 'All I did was ask a girl if she wanted sex.

'I was paralytic after a house party and was on the bus sitting near a really fit girl.

'She was 17, maybe 18. I touched her on the shoulder and said something like "hey why don't you come round to my house for sexual intercourse?"

'It was harmless fun. I shouldn't have done it and I pleaded guilty to sexual assault.

'What man doesn't want to have sex with a pretty girl when they're drunk?'

In 2011 Hersi was jailed for his part in a vicious street robbery.

He added: 'I was on a bus with friends when we got abused by a man for no reason. The argument escalated into a fight which ended up being a robbery.

'I had no intention of taking part in the robbery but it just happened.I was in the wrong place at the wrong time.'

Hersi was born in Somalia but left when he was four years old and eventually arrived in Britain when he was aged eight.

He said: 'I consider myself British, I deserve to be allowed to stay here.

'My life was over after I came out of the young offender's institute because I wanted to be a youth worker but my conviction put me in breach of my immigration agreement.'

The Home Office are believed to still be making efforts to have him sent back to his homeland.

A
Home Office spokesperson said: 'We take all necessary steps to deport 
people who break our laws and in 2012 we removed 4,500 foreign national 
offenders.

'However, 
deportation can be delayed when offenders seek to frustrate the process 
or challenge us on human rights grounds. That is why we have now changed
the rules to make it harder for convicted criminals to dodge 
deportation in the courts.'
