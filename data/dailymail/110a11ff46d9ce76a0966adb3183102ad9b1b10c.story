An Alabama man was allegedly murdered by his two roommates.

Sgt. Dale Phillips with the Tuscaloosa County Sheriff's Office said in a news release authorities found Michael Morton's body Saturday morning inside his residence.

At the time, neither roommates Richard Cheyenne Simmons, 29 and Amanda Sheree Jones, 23, were at the house nor was his truck, Phillips said. 

The two roommates are accused of stealing Morton's vehicle.

'Investigators determined that the victim was killed in the early morning hours of 10-3-2014 and the motive for the incident appears to be [r]obbery,' Phillips said.

They were apprehended by police while driving the allegedly stolen vehicle on a highway Sunday, Phillips said in the release. 

Simmons and Jones face capital murder and theft charges stemming from the incident. 

Phillips previously said they 'have been in contact with Investigators, but have refused to meet with investigators.'

The two alleged murderers are inside the Tuscaloosa County Jail without bond, Philips said. 

The two were charged with theft from separate incidents last year, and Jones entered a guilty plea for filching goods from a store, Tuscaloosa News reported. Simmons' charge is outstanding.
