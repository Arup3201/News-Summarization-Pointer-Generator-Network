As a policeman in the Chinese city of Chongqing, Long Keyi is well used to stopping traffic.

But he caused a hold-up of a different kind recently while on duty for the city's marathon.

The race's female runners thought that he was so good looking that they abandoned their race and surrounded him, battling for the chance to take a selfie with him.

The 29-year-old was mobbed at the race in south-western China partly because many of the admirers thought he looked like a leading Chinese film star, according to the People's Daily Online. 

Hundreds of admirers posted pictures online, with many pointing out his resemblance to actor Wallace Chung.

Yuan Chung, 25, said: 'I thought he looked just like the actor from Hong Kong, Wallace Chung, the guy who is in the news at the moment because of his latest role as a TV cop.'

The crowds became so big, the policeman was surrounded in his car as he tried to leave the sporting event. 

Chyou Teng, 26, who posted a photo, said the furore distracted people from the race.

Already taken: Unfortunately for the women of Chongqing, Officer Long has recently got married

She said: 'I remember reading that some Kenyan runner was the winner but you didn't see him in the newspaper coverage, everybody was just going on about this policeman.

'He was very good natured about it though, and posed for the pictures quite happily.'

Race organisers in the Chongqing Municipality confirmed it had caused congestion with many runners wanting their picture taken alongside him.

But Long's colleagues said his new legion of fans would be left disappointed as he had recently married.

Fellow police officer  Dewei Fu said: 'He only just got back on duty after getting married, so I don't think his new wife will be too impressed.

'Anyway, it was getting a bit out of hand so he was taken off duty and replaced by another less good-looking colleague.'
