A majestic eagle has been caught on camera at the exact moment it swooped down and caught its prey.

These stunning images were taken in Okavango Delta, Botswana, Africa, by wildlife photographer Amos Nachoum and show the hunting skills of the African Fish Eagle in action.

The pictures perfectly demonstrate the precise skill of the giant bird of prey as it swoops down and plucks a fish from the water, with its huge talons and wings spread wide.

Attack: This shot captures the exact moment the eagle swooped down and plucked the fish from the water. The eagle was hunting in the Okavango Delta in Botswana

Majestic: With pinpoint precision, the African Fish Eagle zones in its prey. Angling its body and focussing its eyes dead ahead, the bird prepares to crash into the water

Nachoum, from California, USA, even managed to capture candid underwater shots, showing the bird from the perspective of its prey.

The African Fish Eagle is found near large expanses of water and anywhere there is an abundance of fish and is a large bird with a wingspan the same height as a tall man-  around six foot.

Nachoum said: 'My work takes me all 
over the world and it's great that I get to photograph some of the most 
magnificent animals, such as this fantastic eagle.'

'I
 managed to capture the exact moment it went in for the kill and swooped
 down on it's prey, show its incredible wing span and skill.'

Another angle: This shot is taken from behind the eagle as it prepares to catch the fish. It's wings appear in a near-perfect 'v' shape, counter-balancing its outstretched legs

Lift off: Despite plummeting towards the water incredibly quickly, the eagle bares makes a splash and it grabs the fish and climbs back into the sky

Time for lunch: As the eagle soars into the air its hefty haul can be seen in all its glory

Noucham is well known for his skills as a wildlife photographer, with his usual specialism sea creatures and marine life.

He used his talent for underwater photography to capture these stunning pictures of the eagle, setting up a camera just below the surface of the water and waiting patiently.

Noucham’s work has appeared around the world, used on television as well as in countless US publications.

He says much of his photography is intended to help raise conservational awareness, adding ‘preservation of the environment is foremost in every encounter.’
