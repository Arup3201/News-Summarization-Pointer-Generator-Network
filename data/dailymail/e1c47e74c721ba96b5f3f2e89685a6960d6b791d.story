With a wide grin and upbeat attitude, Stephanie Decker was released from the hospital on Saturday after having both of her legs amputated following the damage sustained from the deadly tornado that swept through Indiana.

‘I must say I feel pretty awesome,’ Mrs Decker told reporters as she left University of Louisville hospital.

‘I didn't expect to feel this way. I feel healthy, I feel strong.

Happy to start healing: Stephanie Decker, 37, spent two weeks in hospital and had to have her legs amputated following the destruction that hit her as she protected her two children from the March 3 tornado

Road to recovery: Mrs Decker left the hospital on Saturday saying she felt 'pretty awesome'

‘I'm ready to tackle rehab. I'm ready to get that part of this stepping stone over but I feel really, really, really good,’ she told MSNBC.

Mrs Decker, 37, lost one leg above the knee and the other foot protecting her 8-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter as the storm flattened their 'dream home' in Henryville, Indiana on March 3.

Her selfless act, which saved her life and the lives of her two children, has inspired many.

She has spoken out previously about the ordeal since she arrived in the hospital two weeks ago, saying that she remembered how uncertain she was about the impending disaster that she filmed a message on her mobile phone to her husband, telling him she loved him.

'I assumed I was safe and I heard the roar like a train, and I heard it behind me, and I knew it was coming,' she told ABC News from her hospital bed in Louisville, Kentucky.

'And it was so loud that I knew that I needed to do something different. I knew staying put wasn't going to work.'

'Dream home': The Deckers had spent nine months building their home in Henryville, Louisiana

Ruins: The home was reduced to a pile of rubble by the 175 mph storm that flattened much of the town

With the house disintegrating, she grabbed her son Dominic, 8, and daughter Reese, 5, and ran to the basement, where she wrapped them in a blanket and climbed on top of them.

'I remember the whole thing,' she said. 'I stayed conscious the whole time. I couldn't afford [to pass out]. They needed me. They had to have me, so I had to figure out what to do.'

She held on tightly to the children as the house fell down around her.

'Everything started hitting my back, beams, pillars, furniture - everything was slamming into my back,' she told The Today Show. 'But I had my children in the blanket and I was on top of them and I was reaching around holding them.

Happy family: Stephanie was surrounded by her family at the hospital, including her husband Joe (left), son Dominic (center right) and Reese (right)

A mother's love: As soon as the storm passed, Dominic, 8, ran to a neighbor's home for help

'They were screaming, "Mommy, I can’t live without you! I don’t wanna die, please don’t let me die!" and I said, "you’re not going to die, we’re going to make it".'

Then she realised she had been badly hurt, with her leg appearing as if it had been severed. She also suffered seven broken ribs and a punctured lung.

Fighting back the tears, she said: 'It was cut off or it was barely attached. I took my phone and I made a video to my husband to tell him I love him.'

Heroine: Stephanie Decker threw herself on her two young children to save them from the tornado that flattened their home. She has recounted the fearful moments from her hospital bed

'I knew it was bad. If I didn't get help soon, I was going to bleed out,' she added to ABC News.

Knowing his mother was hurt, it was Dominic's turn for bravery. He crawled out from under his mother and ran to a neighbor's house.

'After Dominic left, I realised I couldn't get out because I actually used the comforter I tied with them as a tourniquet. I knew I was cut,' she said.

Fears: Mrs Decker was so worried she was going to die as a result of her injuries that she filmed a video on her mobile phone for her husband Joe, pictured, to tell him she loved him

Saved: Mrs Decker protected her two children, eight-year-old Dominic (L) and five-year-old Reese (R)

One neighbour, Brian Lovins, a Clark County Sheriff’s officer, used his belt to create a tighter tourniquet and drove her until he could flag down an ambulance, which took her to hospital.

Mrs Decker added, tearfully: 'I want these kids to have a mum and I did not want them to grow up without me.'

Her husband, Joe Decker, tearfully said that the flattened house had been their dream home.

His wife had said she always wanted to have the children's handprints imprinted in the foundation's cement, because 'we were never gonna leave here'.

The small prints, with the 'Reese' and 'D' for Dominic, remain scrawled in the concrete.

Mr Decker said: 'What I told her was: "You’re alive and you get to see your kids grow up".'

The home, which was partly built by Mr Decker and his wife's father, is now completely destroyed, with a bathtub 200 feet away in a nearby field, the Courier Journal reported.

Gone: The house 'took about nine months to build and about four seconds' to fall, Mrs Decker said

Remaining strong: The children's hand prints can still be seen in the home's foundations

The house 'took about nine months to build and about four seconds' to fall, Mr Decker added.Henryville was nearly entirely flattened by a series of tornadoes that ravaged the South and Midwest on Friday March 3, killing 39 and leaving thousands homeless.

Physicians Ancillary Services, where Stephanie has worked for three years, released a statement, the Frankfort Journal reported.

CEO Carl J. Tyler praised the Deckers who 'lost everything' and said that the company has set up a trust fund, The Stephanie Decker Recovery Fund, to help pay their medical bills and the losses they suffered.

Destruction: The Decker family home was just one of the hundreds 
destroyed by tornadoes in Indiana. Damage can be seen in nearby Marysville which was 
entirely wiped off the map by the severe weather

He added: 'I can tell you they are 
some of the hardest working, giving people you could ever want to meet. 
They would never ask for help, but would be there to give it to others 
in a second.'

The 
Decker’s inspirational story is one of the few from that fateful day, 
which saw deaths in Alabama, Georgia. Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio, with 
Indiana and Kentucky particularly hard hit, with 13 and 21 lives lost 
respectively.

Hundreds of others were injured in the biggest one-day burst of tornadoes in March in U.S. Weather Service history.
