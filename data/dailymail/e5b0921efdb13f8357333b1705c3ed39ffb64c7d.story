Arsene Wenger admitted the top of the table is heating up as Arsenal kept the pressure on with a nervy win against Queens Park Rangers.

The victory kept them in third, ahead of Manchester United and Liverpool in fourth and fifth and behind Chelsea and Manchester City above them in the top two.

‘It’s hot up there because everyone won,’ Wenger said. ‘We can only focus on our performances and keep going. There are 10 games to go, six at home and four away. I haven’t studied everyone else, we can just focus on ourselves.’

Wenger also hailed the performances of Alexis Sanchez and Olivier Giroud, who scored both goals. 

‘It’s good to see Alexis score,’ he added. ‘When he went seven games without it is on your mind even if you say it’s not. Olivier is strong mentally, he can take criticism and respond.’ 

QPR manager Chris Ramsey insisted his side must pick up points in their next few games if they want to avoid being cut adrift. They are already three points behind Aston Villa in the safety of 17th and face Tottenham and Crystal Palace in their next two games.

‘It’s imperative,’ Ramsey said. ‘The last thing we want to do is start getting detached. The next two games, everything is in cup final mode.’
