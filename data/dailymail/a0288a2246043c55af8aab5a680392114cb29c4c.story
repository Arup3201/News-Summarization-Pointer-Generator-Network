Fresh from his record breaking exploits at the Commonwealth Games, Usain Bolt seems to enjoying himself. 

The sprint superstar, who led Jamaica to 4x100m gold in Glasgow in a record time of 38.58 seconds, was in high spirit during a night out in London. 

Bolt was pictured leaving Mahiki nightclub at 3am on Friday with two female companions before heading to Raffles in Chelsea until 5am.

The 27-year-old was seen doing his trademark lightning bolt pose and clutching a bottle of water as he headed appeared to be heading home.

However, there was also a sighting of him in Clapham, south-west London, on the street at about 8am and two hours later in a dentist's surgery.

One patient said: 'I was dropping some forms off at the dentist and there someone rather familiar looking sat in reception. I glanced at the receptionist and she nodded and said "Yes it is".

'It was pretty surreal. He didn't really say why he was there just kept cracking jokes and having a laugh. He seemed in good spirits considering the night before.'

He was apparently wearing a cheap parody of a Comme de Garcon T-shirt, which can be bought for around £20.

Bolt was seen earlier this week relaxing in a hot tub with two bikini-clad girls in a new advert for Puma which also starred Mario Balotelli and Sergio Aguero. 

The Jamaican was the star attraction at the Commonwealth Games, even though he only appeared in the 4 x 100 metres relay.

He endeared himself to fans inside Hampden Park by posing for selfies and signing autographs while wearing stereotypical Scottish clothing.

That followed the big controversy of the Games, when he allegedly called the competition 'a bit s***,' something he subsequently denied and said he was talking about the weather.
