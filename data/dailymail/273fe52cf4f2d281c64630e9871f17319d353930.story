Graham Kavanagh has revealed a text message from Roy Keane made him see the errors of his ways and he is determined to learn from his mistakes as a result.

The former Stoke, Wigan and Sunderland midfielder was sacked as Carlisle boss on September 1 after a poor start to the new season, following on from relegation to League Two.

Kavanagh was appointed on a full-time basis in September 2013 after taking over as caretaker manager following the sacking of Gregg Abbott.

However, the board were unhappy with the progress the team were making and the Irishman was relieved of his duties.

And after several months to consider what went wrong, the 41-year-old has admitted it took a message from his fellow countryman Keane to help him evaluate his management style.

"There was one (a message) from Roy Keane," Kavanagh told the Irish Mail on Sunday.

‘Welcome to the club.’ it said. ‘You’re not a real manager until you’ve been sacked.

'Was he right? Yes. In the process of being sacked, when you are sacked, and immediately afterwards, you don’t see it coming.

The former Republic of Ireland international represented his country 16 times, scoring once

‘You are still so wrapped up in the intensity of getting the job right, of making the players better and getting results, and dealing with the finances that you don’t have time to sit back from it.

‘In the time of reflection after being sacked, you can look back and assess how you could improve, what you can do better. The fact is when you’re winning you don’t analyse things, when you’re losing you look at everything.’

Another mistake Kavanagh discussed is forgetting the perils of managing in the modern era, with news more accessible thanks to social media.

Kavanagh went to tell his players of his sacking, and was asked to remind them not to post anything on social media sites. The club would handle the announcement.

‘I told them I accepted full responsibility and in some ways I’d let them down,’ Kavanagh added.

‘But I did say a few of them had to look themselves in the mirror and look where the club is now.

‘Greg Abbott had gone and they’d had the chance to put that right. There were a few home truths but it needed to be said. I shook their hands, wished them all the best and walked out.

‘And as I walked out the door, I thought ‘**** forgot about the social media thing.’ So I’d walked four steps, literally four steps, turned round, went back in the dressing room, and almost every one of them was on his phone.

‘I just said ‘ah come on lads’ but it was too late.’

And yet he misses it. Wants more of it. He’s learned from it. He doesn’t despair of the Twitterers. He wants to help them and make them better players in his team.

‘There are elements of me I have to change,’ Kavanagh added

‘I have to learn to turn a blind eye to stuff like that and manage it differently. But it’s not easy. No badges prepares you for these things.’
