The free Blab app, pictured, lets users record and send videos to friends, even if the recipient doesn't have the iOS app

After almost a year of teasers, social network Bebo has kickstarted it revival with the release of a video messaging app.

Called Blab, the free service lets users record and send videos to friends, even if the recipient doesn't have the iOS app.

It is the first of three apps set to be released by the California-based social network this year, and signals that the once floundering firm is getting a reboot.

The site itself is also going through a refresh and is set to relaunch 'soon'.

Bebo was once the most popular social network in the UK.

But following the launch of rival sites such as Facebook and Twitter, its numbers dwindled and the site, as its users knew it, eventually closed down.

At the height of its popularity in 2008 - three years after it was created - the site was bought by AOL for $850 million (£510 million).

Only five years later the site was trailing behind its rivals in terms of user numbers, and had developed a reputation for being supposedly rife with bullying.

To save the company from going under in 2013, its founder Michael Birch bought his site back for a cut-price $1million (£600,000).

Birch posted a video shortly after saying it was time to ‘wipe the slate clean’ and promised its users the service would come back fighting.

Reports about the Blab app first appeared in February this year, and now the app is available on the Apple App Store.

According to the app’s listing: ‘Blab is 
the fun app that lets you send quick video messages to your friends and 
family! It’s free to Blab anyone, anywhere in the world.'

To send a Blab, users select a contact, hold the screen to record their video message, and release to send, pictured left.  If the recipient has the app, a notification appears on the app’s icon. If they don’t, the recipient receives the video in a text message with a link that opens the clip in a browser window

The app connects with the contacts in a user’s phone.

Vine
 and Video in Instagram work in a similar way, but the video clips can 
only be sent to other Vine and Instagram users – although they can also 
be shared on other social networks.

Blab doesn’t set a time limit on its videos either, like Vine’s six-second and Instagram’s 15-second rules.

If a user wants to re-record their message, or changes their mind about who the video is sent to, they can shake the handset to ‘destroy’ the clip.

Blab has also taken its privacy lead from
 the likes of Snapchat and only lets users watch the last video they 
were sent. As soon as a new Blab is received from that contact, the destroys the old one 
and replaces it.

In a video, Birch promises users that all their posts and data is safe and will be available once the new site goes live, although doesn't specify when that will be.

The site still faces stiff competition from the likes of Facebook, and the Blab app goes up against behemoths including WhatsApp, Snapchat and Viber. 

The other Bebo apps are expected later this year, but the company has not yet revealed more information about what they will be.
