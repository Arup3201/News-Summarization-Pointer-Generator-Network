It's hard to know how anyone could feel anything but love for these two, but left on their own, a couple of unwanted pets have found a true bond in each other after a dog rescued a baby kitten in Barstow, California.

Beignet, a Longhaired Chihuahua, and Gumbo, a tiny gray kitten, are a package deal, and were found by neighbors of a family who had moved away in early January.

The dog was found nursing the tiny kitten on a night when temperatures fell below freezing and would have died without the dog's help.

Best friends: A long-haired Chihuahua and a tiny gray kitten from California are looking for a new home after being abandoned by their previous owners.

What a couple! The two have been aptly named for their Mardi Gras debut - the pup is now called Beignet and her kitten son is known as Gumbo

Now an animal shelter, the Helen Woodward Center in Rancho Santa Fe is seeking a home for the unlikely pair that has redefined the mother and son bond.

Beignet and Gumbo’s remarkable story began when neighbors reported hearing what sounded like a relocated family’s abandoned dog tending to a new puppy in their former backyard.

With evening temperatures falling to 20 degrees, efforts were made to rescue the canine family. 

Instead of a new puppy, however, the mother dog was found nursing an abandoned kitten.

The animal shelter says the duo have provided a great deal of inspiration.

Mardi Gras parade: 'They love each other. That's all there is to it. It's not complicated,' said the center's inventory manager, Labeth Thompson. 'They needed each other and they were there for each other'

'The strength, nourishment and incredible comfort the two had provided to one other during their time alone was miraculous and their bond was beautiful.

The road traveled by an orphan animal is often filled with mistreatment, loneliness and fear.

How each of these creatures adapts to their challenging circumstances becomes a major factor in their unique personalities and often leaves rescue workers inspired by their unwavering ability to accept, love and trust. 

Side by side: Beignet and Gumbo keep close for comfort

Beignet is 19 months old and Gumbo is 5-months-old. They spend 95% of the day snuggling together.

'This incredible little family really demonstrates the pure hearts of the orphan animals we meet each day,' said Helen Woodward Animal Center Inventory Manager LaBeth Thompson.

'They love each other.  That’s all there is to it.  It’s not complicated.  They needed each other and they were there for each other.'

The story has generated a number of comments from readers, many of whom are pet owners.

'I wish these two well, and hope someone can open up their home to these two awesome little guys and give them the love they deserve,' wrote one commentator.

Others voiced anger: 'These people will get whats coming to them. No excuse for leaving or abandoning animals. Just shows their true character,' said one pet love.

Looking for love: Beignet and Gumbo hope to be relocated to a new home. Either way, they will be moving together

'I would love to know the name of the family who left them behind to freeze and starve. I would post their names all over Facebook for their disgusting, indecent behavior! Rather than find them a home or at the very least drop them at a shelter, they abandoned them? Low life's!'

The Helen Woodward Animal Center said there has been international interest from Switzerland, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Australia, Mexico, Chile and Finland.

The center is requiring a 300 word (or less) essay from potential suitors.

'We want to make sure that the next part of their lives is absolutely perfect and filled with devotion and kindness,' center employee Shannon Bush said in the statement. 'They deserve it. They embody love and comfort and it's time they received it in return.'
