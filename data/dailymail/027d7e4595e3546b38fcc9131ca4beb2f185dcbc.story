Power sliding across pedestrian-only roads and speeding through a dry reservoir, this is the moment a daredevil driver takes on Los Angeles in an adrenaline pumping don't-try-this-at-home video.

Ken Block, 46, a professional motorhead from California, was filmed as he got behind the wheel of a highly modified 1965 Ford Mustang boasting more than 800 horsepower.

In a 12 minute eight second edit of his rubber-burning journey, Block is seen flooring the gas pedal as he performs a mix of his favorite death-defying stunts.

Block then spent five days covering the city's roads in tyre marks while filming the high-octane sequences.

Top moments include a burnout under a freeway bridge and a nail-biting move in which Block drifts underneath a levered hydraulic lowrider.

He later performs donuts around the landmark Randy's Donuts store in Inglewood.

The project was reportedly budgeted at over $1 million and took more than one year to plan, using dozens of cameras from elaborate rigs to GoPros to helicopter and a crew of about 100.

One of the hardest shots to capture was apparently  the film's final sequence, which includes a series of aerial shots of Block's car screaming to the small plot of land above the Hollywood sign.

Block's motor-inspired Hoonigan apparel line, Ford and video-game maker Need for Speed backed the film. 

For the most part there is no soundtrack, just the roaring of the engine and the screech of tortured tyres.

To date more than nine million people have watched Block's video titled Gymkhana Seven: Wild in the Streets of Los Angeles.

This is the seventh Gymkhana production and the series ranks as the most watched and shared branded web franchise of all time.

San Francisco and Paris, among other cities, have previously hosted Block's motorized mayhem.  

Block made his fortune by selling his share of DC shoes, which he co-founded in 1994.

He then turned his attention to rally-cross racing and the drifting-style school of driving known as 'gymkhana.'
