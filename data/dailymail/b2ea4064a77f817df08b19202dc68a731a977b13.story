As far as matches to determine the unofficial world champions go, it could not get any bigger than France vs Brazil in Paris on Thursday night.

The unofficial World Cup final is a repeat of the meeting at the same Stade de France venue  in 1998 when France were crowned world champions by beating Brazil 3-0.

The current unofficial World Cup title holders are Brazil but France will try to pry that casual title from them, even if it is just a friendly in the French capital.

Brazil are on the mend following an embarrassing 2014 World Cup showing on home soil 

There are three rules to determine the unofficial world champions:

Brazil are on the mend following an embarrassing 2014 World Cup showing on home soil, and will take all they can get. Revenge may even be a factor, too, after their defeat in 1998 when two goals from Zinedine Zidane and a third from Emmanuel Petit sealed the World Cup title for France.

The way the unofficial World Cup final works is not unlike a game of conkers, where winner takes all until your next match in an all-or-nothing scenario.

Brazil have held the unofficial title since October 11, when they beat Argentina 2-0 in Beijing, China, and have a chance to chase Scotland at the top of the unofficial World Cup ranking table.

They have some way to go, however, as Scotland sit top with 86 points, ahead of England on 73.
