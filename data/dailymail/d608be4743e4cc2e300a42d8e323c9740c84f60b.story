Watch out West Ham, there is a new footballing power on the march in east London.

That is the message Barry Hearn believes his sale of Leyton Orient to Italian businessman Francesco Becchetti has sent to the Barclays Premier League side.

Becchetti, the head of renewable energy and waste management firm the Becchetti Energy Group, acquired the club earlier this week and Hearn, who has been made Orient’s honorary president, believes that the takeover will allow Orient to compete with their Premier League neighbours.

'If I was West Ham I would be petrified of this fella,' Hearn said. 'This guy can do anything he wants to do if he has the belief and passion. As a fan I don’t think I have been more excited in 20 years about what could happen to this football club. It is what dreams are made of.'

Becchetti was at Wembley in May when Orient were pipped to promotion to the Championship by Rotherham on penalties in the League One play-off final, and the new owner has backed manager Russell Slade to go one better this season.

'I am already envisioning a Championship club,' Becchetti said. Even this year something can happen. We have to forget that penalty and we have to start from zero again.

'Russell was told to give us a list of players and tell us in which position you need reinforcement. For every role you need give me a list of five players and give us the priorities. One minute later he was given permission to start negotiating with the first players on the list. I think he is still hard at work now.

'I am a little bit meticulous – the list will have to be signed by him. He didn’t hesitate – at the end of the season we will go over that list again and assess whether those were the right priorities.'

Becchetti, who has never previously owned a football club, chose to buy Orient over Reading and Birmingham because for its lack of debt and London location.

'We decided to invest in football in England as this is the top notch industry in the world,' he said. 'It was difficult to find a team whose accounts are in order – we did not want to settle other peoples’ debts.

Ambitious: Becchetti is targeting promotion in his first season at the club

'Leyton Orient has a long and great history and roots are important to us. London is one of the most important centres of the world and the team deserves a higher position. These factors brought our focus to Leyton Orient.

Last week Orient settled their dispute with the Premier League about West Ham’s move to the Olympic Stadium, with Becchetti confirming that the club would remain at their Brisbane Road home in Leyton for the foreseeable future.

'Generally I never look at what others do. I am focused on our project and I think that if our project is strong and everything is properly planned everything will happen naturally,' Becchetti said.

'If we have the right passion no one else will compromise our success. If we have the right dose of passion maybe other people will be worried about us. Let’s focus on the present. We have a stadium now, we have to think about the people who will come to our stadium and transmit their passion to our players'

While Hearn sold his 90 per cent stake in the club to Becchetti earlier this week the boxing promoter still owns the stadium, which the Italian has the option of purchasing in two years’ time.

Becchetti also confirmed that a deal is '99 per cent' complete to appoint former Inter Milan and Italy defender Mauro Milanese as Orient’s sporting director. 'He has a great desire to work in London and will support us and support Russell,' the chairman said.
