Their wealth, fame and power puts them head and shoulders above us mere mortals.

But according to these celebrities, true happiness lies in some of life’s simpler pleasures.

More than 100 musicians, politicians and sports stars have shared the secret of what makes them happy for a new book in aid of the BBC’s Children in Need appeal.

The Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson, 55, has revealed in a new charity book that what most sets her spirits soaring is a belief in magic and fairies

Perhaps predictably, both David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Nigel Farage all made the vote-winning claim that their families are the key to their wellbeing.

But others gave unexpected snapshots into their celebrity lives. Bizarrely, the Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson, 55, revealed that what most sets her spirits soaring is a belief in magic and fairies.

She said: ‘I do believe in fairies. I do believe in magic and when you blow on a dandelion, you will see the light of the enchanted spreading their wings and disappearing off on their own journeys, just like you have today when you opened your eyes. Don’t let the day go by without looking for fairies and magic.

Family: Former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney, 72, revealed that he gets his pleasure through his stomach as well as his family, including his daughter Stella (right) and her children

‘That makes me happy, as every day is, therefore, a day of exploration and adventure.’

Meanwhile, former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney, 72, revealed that he gets his pleasure through his stomach as well as his family.

He said: ‘I love to hear the noises in the kitchen as the meal is prepared and then my little grandson climbs on my knee and requests a bite for every bite that I take.’

Tennis champion Andy Murray, 27, said he badly misses his Border Terriers Rusty and Maggie May (pictured) when he is playing in tournaments

Food was also key to Strictly Come Dancing judge Len Goodman, 70, who said ‘eating a bacon sandwich’ was enough to put a smile on his face, while rocker Rod Stewart, claimed that a simple cup of tea made him ‘uncontrollably happy.’

For our most gifted sports stars, however, it seems the key to the good life is a faithful hound.

Tennis champion Andy Murray, 27, said he badly misses his Border Terriers Rusty and Maggie May when he is playing in tournaments around the world, adding: ‘They don’t care whether I win or lose. They make me smile every day I spend with them.’

Former England striker Gary Lineker, 53, agreed, saying: ‘Walking my dog makes me happy. His utter joy at the word “walkies” never diminishes. Such enthusiasm for something so simple is strangely satisfying.’

Other celebrities who took joy from their pets were actress Imelda Staunton, 58, who said she likes to take her dog on early morning walks in the park, and musical impresario Andrew Lloyd Webber, 66, who listed his Turkish Van cats among his greatest pleasures.

The book, entitled What makes Me Happy?, was compiled by schoolgirl Hanni Blaskey, 13, from Hampstead, north London.

She said she had the idea two years ago while watching a Children in Need documentary about a young girl who had to care for her bedbound mother. She wrote to hundreds of famous people, waited outside music studios and even followed celebrities through airports to get their thoughts on happiness.

So far her book has raised £30,000 for the charity appeal.

She said: ‘I just wondered aloud what would make her happy. I thought I’d ask famous people because everyone identifies with them. It was an amazing response.’

What Makes Me Happy? is available to buy at Sainsbury’s for £3. For every copy sold, £2 will donated to BBC Children in Need. 

Prime Minister David Cameron

‘On a personal level, my own happiness index is very easy to explain: it is all about my family. Whether it is the everyday routines I go through with Samantha and the children; taking my youngest daughter Florence to nursery; helping Nancy complete her homework; or watching Elwen play football and rugby, I am happiest when I am with those I love the most and enjoying quality time with them.’

Labour Leader Ed Miliband

‘My family is the most important thing in the world to me so spending time with my wife Justine and my boys Daniel and Sam is what always makes me happy.’

UKIP leader Nigel Farage

‘Being with my four healthy children and thinking about how lucky we all are compared to many. This is a time to think about others less fortunate than ourselves.’

Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps

‘The rare occasion when I check my diary and there’s nothing in it for the next hour.’

London mayor Boris Johnson

‘Being up early enough to see the sun rise over Talland Bay in Cornwall. Nearest thing to paradise on earth.’

The Duchess of York

‘Your eyes open and the life is a fresh, new day, the sunlight nudges through the curtains. I do believe in fairies. I do believe in magic and when you blow on a dandelion, you will see the light of the enchanted spreading their wings and disappearing off on their own journeys, just like you have today when you opened your eyes. Don’t let the day go by without looking for fairies and magic. That makes me happy, as every day is, therefore, a day of exploration and adventure.’

Sir David Attenborough

‘The sun rising in the mountains makes me happy.’

Tennis player Andy Murray

‘Spending time at home with my girlfriend and our two dogs! I travel six months every year and miss being with my dogs a lot. So much so that I have travelled with them to some tournaments! They don’t care whether I win or lose. They make me smile every day I spend with them.’

Presenter Clare Balding

‘Walking my dog Archie every day. Whatever the weather, he makes me smile and we explore the world together.’

Composer Andrew Lloyd Webber

‘My family, good wine, good musicals and my Turkish Van cats.’

Ex-Beatle Sir Paul McCartney

‘What makes me happy is to have a weekend off from my travels and my concerts and spend it with my family. I love to hear the noises in the kitchen as the meal is prepared and then my little grandson climbs on my knee and requests a bite for every bite that I take. There’s nothing better to enjoy than having my wife, kids and grandkids around on a lazy weekend.’
