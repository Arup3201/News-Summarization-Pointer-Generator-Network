Concerning: Dancer Yulia Solodyankina, 22, was last seen leaving a concert in Edinburgh, on Thursday, June 6

Fears are growing for the safety of a university student who went missing after leaving a pub.

Yulia Solodyankina, a Russian national, was last seen leaving a concert at the Wee Red Bar in Lauriston Place, Edinburgh, on Thursday, June 6.

She left the venue after telling friends she was not feeling well.

Miss Solodyankina, who is studying physics at Edinburgh University, was supposed to have been performing with dance music group Anansi but left the pub before they took the stage.

The student from Moscow is then said to have been spotted on CCTV at a Tesco Extra on Nicolson Street, Edinburgh, wearing a backpack.

They tried to contact Miss Solodyankina on her mobile phone, only to discover it had been switched off.

Her phone and her laptop were then found in a city centre flat she shares with friends.

Fellow students say her disappearance is out of character and are asking the public for information on her whereabouts.

The student’s parents have flown to Edinburgh to try to help with the investigation.

Third-year engineering student Antoine Dao, 21, her boyfriend of six months, said Miss Solodyankina’s parents were ‘clearly very worried’ and her father had sent a Facebook message pleading for her safe return.

Mr Dao said: ‘She likes to be connected with the world at all times. This is not like her at all. The message I got from her on Friday didn’t give any indication that anything was wrong.

‘It was just general chit-chat, and she mentioned she had the gig at Musselburgh the next day and said she was getting ready for it.’ Fellow student Matthew Crisp said: ‘This is very out of character for Yulia.

‘She’s a quiet, shy person, but always considerate, very aware of other people’s feelings and she would never do anything like this.

‘She has also always seemed an intrinsically happy and well-grounded person, not someone who would disappear like this.’

Clues: Yulia last sent a text message at 2pm the day after she was last spotted but has not been seen or heard from since

Movements: The 22-year-old Edinburgh University physics student, who is from Moscow, was at the bar with fellow members of the band Anansi, in which she is a dancer, but has since disappeared

A group set up by her friends on Facebook has already received more than 1,000 ‘likes’ from fellow students.

Inspector Barry Darling of Police Scotland said: ‘We know Yulia enjoys music and dance and it may be that she is at one of the many festivals which take place across the country at this time of year.

‘We appeal to Yulia, or anyone who has seen her in the past week, to contact us to let us know she is safe and well.’

An Edinburgh University spokesman said: ‘We are assisting the police in every way we can and are liaising with the student’s family as appropriate at this difficult time.’

Videos and photographs on Facebook show dancer Miss Solodyankina performing with Anansi at The Meadows Festival in Edinburgh earlier this month.

Anansi describe themselves as ‘a group of drummers, dancers and fire performers, named after the trickster spider in the Ashanti tales’.
