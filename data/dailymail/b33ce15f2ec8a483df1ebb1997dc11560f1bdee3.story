French president Francois Hollande has led the tributes to allied forces who helped to liberate France's Mediterranean coastline 70 years ago today.

The so-called southern landings during the Second World War, saw a total 450,000 troops and 881 warships land on the beaches of Provence to liberate the towns and cities including Toulon, Marseilles and eventually Cannes.

The landings came just 10 weeks after the D-Day invasion of Normandy and helped to squeeze the Nazi occupiers in the country, hastening the German defeat and the end of the conflict.

Troops including those from the U.S. and former French colonies in Africa took part in the invasion, code named Operation Dragoon and all took part in today's anniversary memorial in Toulon, where Mr Hollande unveiled a memorial plaque.

Twenty warships, including the USS Mount Whitney, two British minesweepers, and ships from Tunisia, Algeria and Morocco today joined a naval parade off the beaches of Provence.

A special homage was also paid to the tens of thousands African troops recruited by colonisers to fight the Nazis.

Fifteen African leaders, some of whom have strained relations with the former colonial power, were invited to Friday's events.

In a speech, Mr Hollande said: 'France ... is a nation that takes its responsibility to assure the security of Europe but also security in the world, and to act wherever we are asked to act for peace.'

On the evening of August 15, 1944, some 100,000 men landed on the beaches of southern France.

Initially it was planned that the landings would co-incide with those in the north of the country but a lack of landing craft meant it was postponed.

Ten weeks later, troops from the U.S. and the African colonies landed on Alpha and Delta beaches after French resistance fighters damaged communication and transport networks.

Many of the German troops, made up from German-occupied teritories quickly surrendered and the allied forces then went on to capture Camel beach.

As more and more allied troops arrived on the beaches the Germans began to withdraw and three days later, Digne was liberated closely followed by Grenoble.

In his speech, Mr Hollande  said: 'France ... is a nation that takes its responsibility to assure the security of Europe but also security in the world, and to act wherever we are asked to act for peace

The American forces then pushed northwards while battles raged to take back the cities of Toulon and Marseilles and they were both liberated on August 27, 1944.

Allied troops then continued to push northwards as the Germans were unable to dislodge them.

Two weeks later Mont√©limar and Lyon were liberated and by September 20, ports in Marseille and Toulon were re-opened again to shipping.

A total of 7,000 Allied troops were killed and 10,000 were wounded during the operation.

A ceremony dedicated to U.S. troops will take place at the American cemetery of Draguignan on Saturday.

Today's celebrations come just weeks after the 70th anniversary of D-Day where world leaders including U.S. President Barack Obama and the Queen attended a ceremony in Northern France.
