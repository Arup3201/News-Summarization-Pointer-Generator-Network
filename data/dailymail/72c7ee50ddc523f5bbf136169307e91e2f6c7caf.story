Sunday nights may never be the same again.

ITV confirmed yesterday that the sixth series of Downton Abbey will be the very last after ratings for the programme started to dip.

At the height of its success, more than 9.51million viewers sat down to watch the period drama, which depicted the lives of those upstairs and downstairs in early 20th century Britain.

Flagging figures: It has been confirmed that the next series of Downton Abbey will be the last after a drop in viewing figures for recent series of the show

However, by the opening episode of the last season, that figure had dropped to 8.43million.

'Inevitably there comes a time when all shows should end and Downton is no exception,' Executive Producer Gareth Neame said in a statement on Thursday. TV bosses added that they wanted to go out on a high.

While the news will come as a massive blow to fans, the hugely successful show has set many of its stars on the path to showbiz success.

LILY JAMES, 24, LADY ROSE MACCLARE

Before being cast in Downton, Lily actually played a starring role in the hit TV series Secret Diary Of A Call Girl alongside Billie Piper. Lily played Polly, one of Belle's fellow call girls.

Prior to this, Lily had a role in the TV series Just William as Ethel Brown. Since taking part in the hit series as Lady Rose Macclare, Lily has swapped life on the small screen for life in the movies.

The star  is currently promoting her biggest film to date: Cinderella. Lily plays Cinders in the latest Disney adaptation of the fairy tale.

It's not all fairytales though. Lily has also taken a role in Pride and Predjudice Zombies, a zombified adaptation of the Jane Austen novel, which is due for release later this year.

MICHELLE DOCKERY, 33, LADY MARY CRAWLEY 

It was from the stage that Michelle Dockery took the leap onto the set of Downton in 2010 to play Lady Mary, who became one of the most popular characters.

From her relationship with Matthew Crawley (played by Dan Stevens) to playing a larger role in the running of Downton, she's had some of the most talked-about story lines.  

And it didn't go unnoticed; Michelle has been nominated for three Emmys and a Golden Globe award.

Like many of the other Downton actresses, when she's not on the set of the show Michelle has also spent time working on films.

In 2012, she starred in Anna Karenina as Princess Myagkaya and in 2014 she took a part alongside Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore in the thriller Non-Stop. 

Michelle, who is a regular at red carpet events, has previously spoken out about how weird it is being recognised by other famous people.

She once told the Express: 'Laura Carmichael (who plays Lady Edith) and I were at the Met Ball last year and Beyoncé told us she was a fan of the show. That was an amazing and strange experience.

'It’s overwhelming when people who you’ve watched and admired for years, and who you wouldn’t have ever dreamed of coming into contact with, come up to you to tell you how much they enjoy what you’re doing and how much they love Downton. It’s quite a surreal thing, actually.'

The character of Lady Mary has had some of the most talked-about story lines, especially when it comes to her love life 

In Downton Lady Mary is known for trying out different styles and Michelle Dockery is the same, experimenting with colour while on the red carpet at showbiz events

LAURA CARMICHAEL, 28, LADY EDITH CRAWLEY 

For actress Laura Carmichael, the role in Downton as Lady Edith Crawley has been a springboard for success.

 In the series, Lady Edith is one of the more challenging characters, campaigning for women's rights and even taking a job. 

Storylines which Laura has been grateful for. She said: ‘I feel very lucky that my story-line is the way it is in this series. There is a lot to do. It is emotional and meaty stuff. It is exciting and nerve racking but it is enjoyable.’

Having graduated from the Bristol Old Vic drama school in 2007, this was Laura's first big role. She then starred alongside, albeit briefly, Benedict Cumberbatch in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.

More recently, Laura has also worked on a comedy with Ben Stiller named Burn, Burn, Burn, which is thought to be coming out sometime in the next year.  

Laura Carmichael plays Lady Edith in the hit series of Downton, the show was her first big break after leaving drama school 

JESSICA BROWN FINDLAY, 25, LADY SYBIL BRANSON

Jessica played Lady Sybil Branson and was known as one of the most controversial characters after she fell in love with the family's chauffeur, Branson.

However, Jessica's character met an untimely death during series three when she died during childbirth.

Since then, the actress has gone on to enjoy a successful movie career starring in The Riot Club and It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia.

Although Jessica says that she enjoyed the experience of working on Downton she has previously revealed to the Telegraph that she never regretted her decision to leave the hit show. 

She said: 'I don’t regret my decision. I kind of had a gut feeling. I had come to the end of my contract and I was so hungry to do other things. 

'I had had a few jobs in between the filming of the first and second series and then I had had to turn down a job I got [because I was filming] the third series, so it felt right.'

DAN STEVENS, 32, MATTHEW CRAWLEY

Dan Stevens character Matthew Crawley's romance with Lady Mary was one of the highlights of Downton Abbey.

However, it ended prematurely when Matthew was killed off in series three after Dan decided he wanted out of the show. 

At the time, producers said that they made his final scene - in which he had a car crash - ambiguous as to whether or not he had actually died in case Dan decided to change his mind.

Sadly for Downton fans he didn't and Dan went on to have a successful run on Broadway and he has several films coming out in the next couple of years. 

Dan said of his decision to leave after three years on the show: 'We were always optioned for three years. And when that came up it was a very difficult decision. 

'But it felt like a good time to take stock, to take a moment. From a personal point of view, I wanted a chance to do other things.

'It is a very monopolising job. So there is a strange sense of liberation at the same time as great sadness because I am very, very fond of the show and always will be.'

ALLEN LEECH, 33, TOM BRANSON

Irish actor Allen began his career in theatre in 1998 starring in the Coen Brothers production of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire. 

And prior to starring in Downton he tried his hand at another period drama, starring in The Tudors as the lover of Catherine Howard. 

In Downton, Allen plays Tom Branson, the chauffeur who falls in love with Lady Sybil. He has previously said that he found it interesting how America has become such a huge fan of the show. 

He said: 'I only experienced it for the first time at the start of this year. It was mind-blowing how enthusiastic [they are] and how much they’ve really taken it to their hearts. They really love it and love the characters.' 

Allen has also tried his hand at the movies and has shot a film called Hunter's Prayer alongside Odeya Rush.

 A small role...led to bigger things: Rose Leslie played Gwen Dawson in series one

ROSE LESLIE, 28, GWEN DAWSON

For Scottish-born Rose, Downton has not actually been her biggest career move. 

She only had a relatively small part in series one playing maid Gwen Dawson. However, she has gone on to big things.

Rose has starred in the hit HBO series Game of Thrones. She also took a part in the teen film Now is Good alongside American actress Dakota Fanning. 

Rose previously denied that she would go back to Downton saying: 'It’s not my call and two, we left my character in a very happy place, married, out of domestic service and living the life she always wanted.'
