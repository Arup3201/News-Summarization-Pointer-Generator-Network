Roma returned to winning ways to close the gap on Serie A leaders Juventus following a 3-0 victory over Torino at the Olimpico Stadium.

Having recently lost to both Napoli and Bayern Munich - and with Juventus defeating Parma 7-0 earlier on Sunday - the Giallorossi needed a win to keep their title challenge on course.

They got off to a great start when Vasilis Torosidis slotted home Francesco Totti's cross in the eighth minute.
