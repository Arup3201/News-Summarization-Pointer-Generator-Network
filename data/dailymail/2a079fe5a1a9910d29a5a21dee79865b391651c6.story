Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger should sign either Sven or Lars Bender ahead of their international team-mate Ilkay Gundogan, according to former Premier League midfielder Dietmar Hamann.

The Gunners have been linked with making a move for Borussia Dortmund's Gundogan in recent weeks but Hamann believes Arsenal already possess similar players to the deep-lying playmaker.

Hamann insists Wenger should instead target a  defensive midfielder in the mould of 'Nemanja Matic and John Obi Mikel at Chelsea; or Fernando and Fernandinho at City' such as Dortmund's Sven or Bayer Leverkusen's Lars.

Speaking to the Mirror, Hamann said: 'There are players out there, who would instantly make Arsenal a better team. They are supposed to be looking at Ilkay Gundogan at Borussia Dortmund. He’s a very good footballer – but he’s a typical Arsenal player.

'He won’t want to do the dirty work. His instinct is to join in further up the pitch, get a few forward passes going and try to weigh in with a few goals.

'For me, Arsenal would be much better served, going for one of the Bender brothers, especially Lars.'
