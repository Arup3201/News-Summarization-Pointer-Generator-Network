Wales' Six Nations curtain-raiser with England is bound to be a bone-crushing affair to get the tournament started.

While the match at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff is set to be a fast-paced tussle, fine details are likely to separate the two sides.

Wales head coach Warren Gatland and his England counterpart Stuart Lancaster will have both devised a gameplan to win the game on Friday night.

Here, Sportsmail assesses the crucial elements of where the match will be won or lost for either side.

The midfield gain line - Stand up George Ford

Wales’ famous ‘Warrenball’ strategy is basically pretty simple. It’s based around power runners blasting holes in the opposition defence and forcing their way across the gain line to give the pack momentum.

In Jamie Roberts and Jonathan Davies, Wales have a midfield with a combined weight of more than 33 stone who are capable of off-loading out of the tackle for supporting runners to surge forward.

At just 13st 3lb, England fly-half George Ford is certain to be targeted by the Welsh centres while England centres Jonathan Joseph and Luther Burrell will need to ‘get in the faces’ of their opposite numbers in defence to stop Welsh attacks before they reach the gain line.

Joseph is also the quickest of the four men and will look to exploit a weakness in Davies’ defence on the outside, which South Africa took advantage of ruthlessly last summer.

The scrum - No excuses for England this time

The last time England visited the Millennium Stadium they were heavily penalised at the scrum by referee Steve Walsh and their game disintegrated without a set-piece platform. England were left incensed and frustrated by some of Walsh’s decisions.

Friday night’s French referee Jerome Garces is renowned as an excellent referee of the scrum and England will have no excuses if they come off second best again.

Picking Dan Cole at tighthead prop in place of the injured David Wilson following a six-week lay-off is a gamble by Stuart Lancaster but England will be hoping the experienced Leicester No 3 can have a bigger scrummaging impact than the Wales tighthead prop Samson Lee.

Discipline - Keep calm, Dylan

Lancaster places a huge emphasis on discipline but England’s has not been brilliant in recent times. They were heavily penalised in the defeat by South Africa last autumn when Dylan Hartley was sent to the sin-bin in the second half for a petulant stamp. The England hooker is sure to be on the receiving end of some Welsh provocation tonight and if he can keep his cool his side will benefit.

Kicking game - Chase hard and keep your nerve

Fly-half Ford impressed in the autumn with the variety of his kicking game, while scrum-half Ben Youngs is also considered a fine box kicker. England must chase well or risk the likes of George North and Alex Cuthbert returning with interest.

Kicking at goal is sure to be key and will also be linked to discipline. If England concede penalties in their own half then Leigh Halfpenny  is sure to punish them as one of the world’s best goal-kickers.

Ford, who is in the infancy of his international career, has been working with Jonny Wilkinson’s kicking mentor, Dave Alred, and he faces the biggest challenge of his career on Friday night. He will never have kicked in such a hostile environment.

The breakdown - Channel No 7

The debate over whether Chris Robshaw is an out-and-out No 7 is unlikely to die down soon but Wales have no doubts over Sam Warburton’s openside credentials. Robshaw got the better of his man at Twickenham last year and England’s work in this area will be boosted by Cole’s return.

James Haskell has been dominant in this area for Wasps this season and England will look to their in-form No 6 to help speed up ball recycling in attack and slow down Welsh ball in defence. Every attacking side needs quick ball to flourish and both sides will be desperate for it on Friday night.

The coaches Gatland’s been there and done it

Warren Gatland has a significant edge over Lancaster in terms of experience but a six-year contract signed last year by the England head coach leaves him knowing he has time on his side in the job.

Both sides will look to spring surprises in attack and defence with the smallest advantage set to make a difference.

Is the roof important?

Not really. The forecast is chilly but dry and with the Millennium Stadium’s steep sides the wind should not be a huge factor. Arguably the game could be faster with the fresher air which will not cause dew to form on the pitch as can happen with the roof on.

England are clearly concerned about communication with decibel levels set to match a jet fighter flying at 50 feet, and having the roof open will allow some noise to dissipate.
