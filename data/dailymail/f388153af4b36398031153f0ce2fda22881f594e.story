Cherie Blair has focused on legal and charity work since her husband Tony quit as prime minister

Cherie Blair is set to join Renault next month to improve the diversity on its board, it has been revealed.

The French car manufacturer has approached the well-known women’s rights activist as it attempts to improve its female representation.

Mother-of-four Mrs Blair, 60, has been concentrating on her legal and charity work since her 61-year-old husband Tony left the office of prime minister in 2007.

Renault - the world’s fourth biggest car maker by sales through its alliance with Nissan - said the barrister would also add helpful experience in employment and human rights law.

Mrs Blair, who ‘works closely’ with more than 20 charities according to her website, has never previously been appointed to a French corporation, reported The Daily Telegraph.

Last year she left human rights practice Matrix Chambers to join the international legal consultancy firm Omnia Stategy, which she co-founded four years ago.

Mrs Blair, who was born into a working-class family in Liverpool, also founded the Cherie Blair Foundation for Women, which helps female entrepreneurs in the developing world.

A quota system exists in France to demand that women make up 20 per cent of board members – a figure that will rise to 40 per cent in 2017. 

Four of Renault’s current 19-member board are women.

Other prominent women in the male-dominated industry include Ursula Piëch of Volkswagen, Mary Barra of General Motors and Patience Wheatcroft of Fiat Chrysler, reported the Financial Times.

Mrs Blair is set to be proposed as a director for four years at Renault's annual shareholders meeting on April 30, according to a list of resolutions published by the firm last Friday.

Meanwhile, it was reported earlier this week that her husband is to step back from his role as Middle East peace envoy.

The former Labour leader has been the envoy for the Middle East Quartet peace negotiators - the UN, the EU, Russia and the US - since he quit as prime minister.

It is understood that the former Prime Minister has met John Kerry, the US secretary of state, and Federica Mogherini, the EU's foreign policy chief, to discuss a possible job change.
