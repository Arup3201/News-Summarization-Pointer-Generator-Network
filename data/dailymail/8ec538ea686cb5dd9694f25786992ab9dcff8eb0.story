A couple have been arrested in India for allegedly torturing their 11-year-old maid by inserting green chillies into her genitals.

Sarjil Ansari, a 38-year-old napkin seller, was arrested at the weekend along with his wife Farhat, after claims that they beat and starved the girl who was forced to look after their children and clean their house.

According to the girl's complaint she was often forced to eat the chillies if she urinated through fear while being tortured.

A couple have been arrested in Thane, near Mumbai, India, for allegedly torturing their 11-year-old maid by inserting chillies into her genitals

While the abuse was taking place the couple used to turn up their stereo in order to drown out the girl's screams.

A local police officer said: 'They used to regularly torture and beat up the girl. The girl complained that she was forced to eat chillies, which were also applied on her body.

'Often the family would turn up the volume on their home music system to muffle her cries for help.'

Mr Ansari allegedly bought the girl for £150 from her parents in Utta Pradesh province last year, promising them that she would be sent to school in Mumbai and be given a good education.

Instead she was forced into domestic servitude where she was required clean utensils, wash clothes, dust and even run errands for the couple's business.

According to the Times of India, if the girl misbehaved she was beaten and starved for days on end. When she was found by police she had serious injury marks all over her body, including her stomach, back and neck.

The case is the latest of alleged abuse of domestic servants in in India, where thousands of workers, often children trafficked from remote and poverty-stricken states, toil for long hours in homes with almost no legal protection.

In October last year, a teenage girl working as a maid in New Delhi was hospitalised after being rescued from a home where campaigners said she was slashed with knives and mauled by dogs.

In 2006 India passed legislation banning employment of children under 14 in households, roadside eateries and hotels, but the law is widely flouted in the country of 1.2 billion people.
