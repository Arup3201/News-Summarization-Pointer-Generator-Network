Michael Schumacher's wife Corinna was all smiles at the World Equestrian Games in France on Tuesday as she made a rare public appearance nearly eight months on since her husband's skiing accident shocked the world.

The 45-year-old, an official ambassador of the Games, was among those in attendance on the second day of the Championships in Caen, France, as she was seen smiling alongside spectators.

Since being named as a key face of the Championships last month Corinna has pledged her support on many occasions, in between lengthy vigils at her husband's bedside.

Legend: Seven-time F1 world champion Schumacher is well-respected in the sporting world

Seven-time F1 world champion Michael came out of a medically-induced coma in June and was moved from a hospital in Grenoble, France, to a rehab clinic closer to his Swiss home.

When speaking to German magazine Neue Post about her husband's recovery: 'It’s getting better, slowly certainly, but in any case it’s improving.' 

The world of motorsport was left stunned when Schumacher hit his head on rocks while skiing in the French Alps on December 29, leaving him paralysed and unconscious for several months. 

But the recent comments from Corinna has given the 45-year-old's millions of fans hope he will eventually make a full recovery. 

Croatian doctors Darko Chudy and Vedran Deletis, who have developed a revolutionary microchip implanting technique, were reportedly approached to see if they could help the former F1 driver.

It is believed such a microchip will be able to help Schumacher walk and talk again after his extended period in a coma.

And with the  unwavered and continued support from his loyal wife there remains the hope the F1 legend will one day make a full recovery.
