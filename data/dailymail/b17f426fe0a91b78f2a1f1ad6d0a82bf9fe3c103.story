A baby has amazed doctors by thriving despite being born with only half a heart.

Scarlett Crowther’s parents Rebecca Turner and Daniel Crowther were advised to have a termination because her chances of surviving longer than a few days were 50/50.

But after two major heart operations - including one at just five days old - she is now a healthy nine-month-old with a bright future ahead of her.

Doctors discovered Scarlett had a defect called hypoplastic left heart syndrome - which meant the left side of her heart wouldn't develop in the womb – during her mother’s 20-week scan.

Ms Turner, 20, said: ‘It was devastating but termination wasn't an option for us - we wanted to give Scarlett the best chance we could.

‘The doctors said it was unlikely she'd survive very long but I got great support from Daniel so we both decided to carry on.

‘It was especially difficult as we were first time parents. Thankfully Scarlett is much better now and we can't believe how healthy and happy she is.’

Days after Scarlett was born in June last year, she had a seven-and-a-half hour operation at Liverpool's Alder Hey Children's Hospital.

Surgeons put an artificial tube inside her to help the blood flow to her heart.

Scarlett had more major surgery at eight-months-old when a vein was attached from her neck to her heart in an eight-and-a-half hour operation.

Ms Turner, who lives with boyfriend Mr Crowther, 22, in Oldham, Greater Manchester, said: ‘I couldn't believe it when she was allowed home six days later.

‘But Scarlett's progress has been amazing.’

Scarlett will need further surgery as her heart grows to make sure the vein stays attached.

But Ms Turner said: ‘Although her heart will never be fully formed she'll be able to lead a normal life.’
