A widow who gave birth to her husband's twins through IVF after he died is embarking on a legal battle to ensure her children are treated as their father's heirs.

Paula Mattison is taking her fight to the Michigan Supreme Court after her now 11-year-old twins were denied survivor benefits because they were not yet alive at the time of their father Jeffrey Mattison's death.

The Social Security Administration in Michigan, U.S., has refused to grant Mallory and Michael Mattison the monthly benefits, citing the fact that they did not technically 'survive' their father.

'The law has not caught up with the science': The Michigan Supreme Court will decide whether the twins should be treated as their father's heirs even though they were conceived and born after his death

When Mr Mattison first fell ill, he decided to have some sperm frozen so that the chemotherapy treatment he was about to undergo would not prevent him and his wife from having children.

When he died in 2001, his wife used the preserved sperm to conceive through IVF, and Michael and Mallory were born around 10 months after her husband's death.

She believes her son and daughter are entitled to receive survivor benefits - worth a few hundred dollars per month based on Mr Mattison's earnings - but the Social Security Administration has refused to pay out.

The Michigan Supreme Court will hear the case - the first of its kind in the state, and one of only a handful across the U.S. - on Thursday.

Joan Coulter, a family law attorney in St Louis, Missouri, said: 'A lot of these situations are so new that the law has not caught up with the science.

'We're making new law here, and it's a pretty exciting time if you're a lawyer,' she told the Detroit Free Press.

'Why shouldn't these kids get the money?' asked Mrs Mattison's attorney Victor Bland, who pointed out that the twins' 14-year-old sister Jenna - who was also conceived through IVF, but before her father's death - is receiving the benefits.

Some U.S. states allow for inheritance to be awarded to children conceived posthumously, but Michigan is not one of them.

State law says that for children to inherit they must 'survive the decedent'.

'Thus, the individual is required to be alive at the time of the decedent's death,' attorneys for the Social Security Administration state in court papers.

Before he died, Jeffrey Mattison left a power of attorney authorizing his wife to take 'any and all action necessary pertaining to any sperm or embryos I may have stored, including their implantation or termination'.Mr Bland argues conception shouldn't be defined solely by the moment when sperm meets egg, but is instead 'a process'.In the case of the Mattisons, that process spanned many months and Jeffrey Mattison was alive for much of it, even injecting his wife with hormones to assist the process the night before he died, the lawyer has said.

But the Social Security Administration insists 'there is no basis for this interpretation of "conception" in the state...statutes'.
