A Fox & Friends host today spent just 13 seconds addressing a sick joke he made on Monday's show about the video of ex-Baltimore Ravens player Ray Rice punching his fiancée in an elevator.

'The message is take the stairs!' Host Brian Kilmeade had quipped on Monday.

The comment, which was made following a discussion about the footage showing the NFL running back  knocking his now-wife unconscious in February, drew sharp criticism.

On Tuesday, Kilmeade addressed the quip - but fell short of apologizing.

'Comments we made during this story yesterday made some feel like we were taking the situation too lightly,' he said to the camera. 'We are not, we were not. Domestic violence is a very serious issue to us, I can assure you.'

No apologies: on Tuesday, Fox & Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade addressed a 'joke' he made about the video showing Ray Rice punching his wife on Monday, insisting they treat domestic violence seriously

Having a laugh: On Monday, Kilmeade (right) made his co-hosts Steve Doocy and Anna Kooiman laugh with his sick quip: 'The message is take the stairs!'

After he made the remark on Monday, his co-hosts Steve Doocy and Anna Kooiman giggled before Doocy added: 'The message is when you’re in an elevator, there’s a camera' before smoothly segueing into a new report.

The presenter's remarks led to outrage online. News and politics editor at Global Grind, Christina Coleman, tweeted today: 'Why am I not surprised? This is how Fox News handled #RayRice video.'

Dan Murphy posted: 'If there's a more ghastly assemblage of callous mouthbreathers than Fox and Friends on TV I don't want to know.' 

Al Jazeera anchor Richelle Carey simply dubbed Kilmeade's remark as 'moronic'.

On Monday, TMZ released the previously unseen footage filmed by a security camera inside the elevator in the Revel Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City in February.

The video reveals the couple – who married a month later – engaged in a heated exchange as they entered the lift. 

Ex Ravens player Ray Rice drew further criticism during a press conference with his wife in May, where she apologized, but he didn't say sorry to her for punching her in the face 

Once inside Rice can clearly be seen to slap his girlfriend, before she hits him and the 5-foot, 8-inch, 220-pound athlete then punches her with such force that he knocks her off her feet. 

Janay then smashes her head on the elevator hand rail and falls unconscious to the floor.  

The Baltimore Ravens terminated Rice's $40 million contract on Monday in the wake of the release.

Minutes later, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Rice from the league indefinitely and said he would have to apply for reinstatement.

The announcements follow hours of intense pressure on the Ravens and the NFL to give Rice a more appropriate punishment for brutally beating his now wife.

NFL officials had sparked shock and outrage in July when they handed him just a two-game suspension and a $500,000 fine.

In addition to his successful career in journalism at Fox, Kilmeade has been a stand-up comedian for ten years, according to his online bio.
