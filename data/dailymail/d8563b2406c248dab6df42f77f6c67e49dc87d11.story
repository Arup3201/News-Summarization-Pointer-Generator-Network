Pippa Middleton was all smiles as she arrived at Heathrow's Terminal 5 Airport with her boyfriend Nico Jackson after a weekend of shooting pheasant and partridge in Edinburgh.

The sister of the Duchess of Cambridge was photographed chatting on the phone as she walked through the arrivals lounge with her suitcase.

The socialite looked autumnal sporting a grey knitted jumper and camel coloured cape coat.

Pippa Middleton spent the weekend shooting grouse on The Drum Estate in Edinburgh which belongs to her former boyfriend Billy More-Nesbitt

Over the weekend Pippa, a well-known fan 
of the sporting life, was pictured grinning broadly with her friends 
after what looks like a successful dayâ€™s at the sprawling Drum Estate in
Gilmerton, south of Edinburgh.

The front row consists of partridges, the middle row has hen pheasants, while the back line comprises cock pheasants.

The
photograph was posted on the picture-sharing website Instagram 
yesterday by a user called John Greig, whose page is publicly available 
for anyone to view.

He apparently posted the image just hours after the shoot.

It
is believed the shoot may have been organised by Charlotte More 
Nisbett, the husband of Billy More Nisbett, whose family own the estate.

Earlier this year, Pippa grabbed the headlines after she went on a boar and deer hunting trip in France.
