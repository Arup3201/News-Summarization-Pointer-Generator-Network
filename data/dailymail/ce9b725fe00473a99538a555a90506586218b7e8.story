A widow whose husband bled to death in her arms just two days after routine tonsil surgery has won a $13 million case against his surgeon.

Eric Price, a 38-year-old father-of-two from Hull, Massachusetts, underwent a tonsillectomy at South Shore Hospital in 2004 to treat his sleep apnea, the Boston Herald reported.

But two days after the surgery, he  started bleeding uncontrollably and his wife, Cynthia Price-Brown, saw him rush into the bathroom.

'I knew something was wrong right away,' Price-Brown, now 53, told the Herald. 'Maybe four to six minutes later my husband bled to death in my arms.'

In 2007, she filed a malpractice suit against her husband's surgeon, Dr. Peter Ambrus, who had suggested that Price have the tonsillectomy.

On Wednesday, she won a $13 million verdict against him, but the agreement requires she receive only $1 million - but she told the Herald that it's not the money that matters to her.

'I feel like I finally have justice for Eric,' she said.

The doctor had performed four surgeries on price - but they were ill-advised because Price's sleep apnea was so mild, Robert M. Higgins of Lubin & Meyer had argued.

Suit: Dr Peter Ambrus, Price's surgeon, 'feels terrible' about the death of his patient, attorneys said

But Ambrus' attorney had countered that heavy bleeding is a known complication of the surgery, and that death is always a risk when undergoing any operation.

The attorney, William J. Dailey III, said that his client 'feels terrible' about the outcome. 

According to Price-Brown's Facebook page, she has now remarried. 

Around 380,000 tonsillectomies are performed annually in the United States. 

Tonsillectomies are carried out to remove the tonsils in order to help tonsillitis, sleep apnea, airway obstruction or snoring, among other issues.

In children, the adenoids are sometimes removed at the same time.

They are riskier for adults given the larger size of the vessels and arteries compared to those in children.

Up to two per cent of patients bleed within 24 hours of surgery, while up to 3.7 per cent of patients bleed between six and 10 days after surgery, according to Kristin Hayes, an ENT disorders experts.. Few are fatal.

Most recently, last year, 13-year-old Jahi McMath of Oakland, California, started bleeding from her mouth and nose following tonsil surgery and was later declared brain dead.
