Accused: Physiotherapist Miles Haslam appears at the Health & Care Professions Council today accused of inappropriate behaviour towards his patients

A physiotherapist is alleged to have unhooked a patient's bra, smacked her bottom and talked about porn as he treated her for lower back problems, a conduct hearing has heard today.

Miles Haslam, who owned his own practice but was Bupa registered, is said to have asked the patient whether she 'liked' a shoulder massage he performed on her during one of four sessions.

The allegations came to light in 2011 after a friend of the victim, named only as Patient A, mentioned similar concerns, prompting her to complain to Bupa about the sessions with Haslam in August and September 2008.

Sophie Lister representing the Health and Care Professions Council (HPC) said: 'Patient A reported that she she stopped attending sessions with Mr Haslam because he behaved inappropriately.

'He had undone her bra, slapped her on the bottom and talked about pornography in the sessions.

'A friend of Patient A mentioned similar concerns to her, which compelled Patient A to complain.'

A letter was sent to Tracey-Ann Fletcher, customer services director at Bupa, which mentioned how Haslam would undo patient A's bra strap and do it back up without asking.

The hearing heard that the 'last straw' for the patient was when Haslam massaged her shoulders and asked if she liked it.

Ms Lister said: 'Bupa wrote to Mr Haslam to outline the complaint on 28 February 2012 and Tracey-Ann Fletcher spoke to him.

'Mr Haslam did ask if the matter could be internal.'

The physiotherapist was de-registered from Bupa in 2012 and it stopped funding to Haslam.

Mr Haslam faces one accusation of behaving inappropriately.

He is also accused of his actions being sexually motivated, misconduct, his fitness to practise being impaired and his actions being dishonest, all of which he denies.

The hearing, which is expected to last two days, continues.
