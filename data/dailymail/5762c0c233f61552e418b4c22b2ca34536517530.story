Traditional flannel bed sheets which kept millions of people on the home front warm during the Second World War are back in fashion as heating bills soar.

Demand for bed linen made from the cosy, naturally warm fabric is rising rapidly because gas and electricity bills are now so expensive.

Sales figures show flannel sheets are now out-selling many silk varieties, according to department store Debenhams.

Traditional flannel bed sheets are back in fashion after more than half a century as heating bills soar, department store Debenhams has said

Ed Watson, a spokesman for the store, said: 'Customers are snuggling up to a piece of British history once again.'

He said the surge in sales is the first time flannel sheets have been in vogue in Britain for more than half a century.

Mr Watson said: 'The natural texture of flannel sheets holds tiny pockets of air between bed and sleeper - the ideal design to trap heat, regardless of the freezing weather outside.

'For decades they had been the bed linen of choice in homes where central heating was unheard of, and the only heat came from a single fire in the kitchen.

The increase in demand for sheets made of the naturally warm fabric is believed to be due to soaring gas and electricity bills

'However, the introduction of new, man-made materials following post war shortages of natural products saw flannel sheets sales begin to decline in the 1960s and early 70s.'

Mr Watson said nylon became popular with new households, where working mothers no longer had time to iron, because of its crease-proof qualities.

And cotton sheets became popular in the 1980s as worldwide production made even the finest weaves affordable for the first time.

He said: 'The increasing popularity of central heating spurred demand still further as customers opted for bed linen with a cooler feel.

'Silk sheets whose vivid colours made the message from the bedroom abundantly clear first became all the rage in the 1990s, reflecting the reign of the ‘Medallion Man’ as well the tastes of popular footballers and their wives.'

Experts believe the current surge in demand for flannel has been created by soaring gas and electricity bills.

Mr Watson said: 'Customers have discovered that buying cosy, traditional flannel bed linen is much, much cheaper than leaving their central heating on in the bedroom all night.

'They tell us that there’s a wonderful sense of comfort when slipping between flannel sheets, a feeling of being snugly wrapped and looked after which doesn’t come from any other material.

'They’re the ideal answer to tough times.'
