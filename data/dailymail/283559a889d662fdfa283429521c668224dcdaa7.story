Still missing: The 1988 case of missing Pinole, California girl Amber Swartz-Garcia was reopened Tuesday

Police in Northern California reopened on Tuesday the case of a 7-year-old girl who vanished from her family’s front yard 25 years ago.

Amber Swartz-Garcia hasn’t been seen by her Pinole, California family since 1988, but officials bowed to pressure from her mother and local community members Tuesday by agreeing to reopen the case in order to use improved forensic technology.

This, despite a 2009 confession to the girl’s murder by known area child killer Curtis Dean Anderson.

Though her case had been subsequently closed, not everyone believed Anderson.

‘I think he wanted to make a name for himself and get off of death row,’ Amber’s mother Kim Swartz told KTVU.

Swartz was joined by 1,300 others who signed a petition to get the case reopened.

The announcement was made Tuesday night at a Pinole City Council meeting.

‘The
bottom line is Amber wasn't found and we want to make sure we do 
everything we can to locate her,’ Police Chief John Hardester said.

Meanwhile,
Hardester was clear that there is no new evidence in the case and that 
Anderson, who died just a month after his confession, has not been 
cleared in the case.

Then and now: Amber was 7-years-old when she disappeared from her family's front yard in June of 1988. She has been missing since. Age progression technology was used to what Amber might look like now, in her early 30s.

Murderer? The case was reopened despite a 2007 confession from known child killer Curtis Dean Anderson, who said he drove Amber to Arizona, killed her, and buried her body near a highway

Doubt: Anderson died just a month after he confessed to murdering Amber and police say they were unable to 're-interview' him regarding his crimes

Swartz was still buoyed by the new turn in her young daughter’s tragic case.

‘I'm totally excited,’ Swartz said before a cheering crowd. ‘Like maybe my days of running into brick walls is over with.’

The FBI offered Pinole police the use of their forensic labs in order to expedite the investigation.

'It is hoped that opening the case will encourage information exchange regarding the case,' police said in a statement, 'and to generate information that might lead to the recovery of Amber Swartz.'

'I'm totally excited': Amber's mother Kim Swartz was joined by 1300 people who sign a petition to get her daughter's case reopened

Good and bad: Community members cheered the announcement from Pinole Police Chief John Hardester, who maintained nonetheless that no new evidence has been uncovered to refute Anderson's confession

Anderson
told authorities that he forcibly took Amber from in front of her home 
in 1988 and eventually killed and buried her in Arizona.

Amber's body has never been located. His death came, according to police, before he could be 're-interviewed' regarding his confession.

Amber
is among eight females Anderson was convicted of kidnapping and 
murdering, including the most recent victim Xiana Fairchild. Fairchild 
disappeared December 9, 1999.

Despite
his death and confessions, the FBI is still ‘seeking the public’s 
assistance in identifying alleged victims’ of Anderson’s.

Serial killer: Curtis Dean Anderson had confessed to at least eight murders when he died in 2007. Police were subsequently unable to interview him further. Now family and supporters of Kim Swartz say they have room to doubt his confession

Curtis Dean Anderson was sitting on death row at California's Corcoran State Prison when he confessed to the murder of 7-year-old Amber Swartz-Garcia.

He told police in 2007 that he forcibly took the girl and drove to Arizona, where he said killed and buried her along a highway in the town of Benson.

One month after his confession, on December 9, 2007, Anderson died before police were able to 're-interview' him regarding his confession.

The Swartz-Garcia case was closed in 2009. Her body has yet to be recovered.

Anderson's most recent known murder was of a 7-year-old Vallejo, California girl named Xiana Fairchild in 1999, for which he was sentenced to 300 years in prison.

The killer confessed to at least eight murders, though most of his victims--all of them female--remain unidentified. Nearly all were in or near the San Francisco Bay area beginning with the murder of a Marysville woman in her late teens or early 20s in 1984.

Anderson admitted to two other murders in Mexico, but did not provide details.

Despite his confessions and the time since the murders, the FBI website still says the agnecy is 'seeking the public’s assistance in identifying alleged victims of convicted killer Curtis Dean Anderson.'

Anderson was first captured after one of his kidnapping victims was able to escape.
