West Brom striker Saido Berahino feels 'people should be softer' on him following his recent behaviour at the club.

Berahino infuriated team-mates and club ­officials in early February when he said in an interview that he hoped to move on to bigger and better things next season.

It was the latest incident this season involving the young Baggies forward after he was disqualified from driving for a year and fined £3,400 after being found guilty of a drink-driving charge in January.

'The media wants me to be a bad boy, but those who know me know I'm not that,' Berahino  told Sport magazine.

'People read it so much it becomes fact. But if every footballer sat down and read everything that had been said about them, they'd lose their minds.

'I chose this career and you just have to get on with it, but certain people should be softer on me. I try to be a good guy. I've never met anyone I've hated or hold any grudges against. I'm as easygoing as any other 21-year-old.'

Berahino has never been far away from controversy this year following his drink driving charge in January 

Berahino, who has scored 16 goals in all competitions this season, could be moved on by West Brom in the summer.  

'I've no idea who is valuing me at £20m,' said Berahino on a potential transfer move. 

'The media loves hype, and if that's what they think I am worth then that's their opinion. I know my strengths and weaknesses; all I want to do is grow and score goals.'

Albion manager Tony Pulis has spoken to Berahino about his responsibilities at the club following his recent misdemeanors.

'He's not that bad, you know,' Berahino explained.

'He's easy to work with. He lays out his instructions, and you are always comfortable playing for him because he talks to you and you know exactly what you have to do. That makes your life easy.'
