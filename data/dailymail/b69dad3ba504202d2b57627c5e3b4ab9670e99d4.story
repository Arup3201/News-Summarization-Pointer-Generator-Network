Sam Allardyce swallowed a second defeat in three days but not without launching a furious attack on referee Neil Swarbrick's decision to rule out an early goal by Alex Song.

Allardyce claimed he was 'confused' and 'bewildered' and that West Ham would not have lost if the goal had stood.

Song's fifth-minute volley was disallowed because Cheikhou Kouyate and Diafra Sakho were both offside as they leapt out of the way, one jumping to the side and the other allowing the ball through his legs.

They were ruled to be interfering with Wojciech Szczesny's line of vision but the West Ham boss claimed this clashed with information given to managers at the start of the season by the referees' ruling body, the PGMOL.

'From what they told us, they've got it horribly wrong,' fumed Allardyce. 'You base your opinions on what they tell you. He didn't touch the ball. He wasn't in the eye-line of the keeper.

'Yes, he was offside but we've seen so many of those allowed as goals. I've not seen one 'not given'.

'It's gone through Sakho's legs and he is three yards to the right of Szczesny, so he's not in his eye-line. There are six players obstructing his eyeline. It's come through everyone.

'Neil Swarbrick cannot have a clear view whether Sakho is directly in the keeper's eyeline.'

Even Arsene Wenger admitted he was surprised the goal had been ruled out.

Sam Allardyce swallowed a second straight defeat but not without launching a furious attack on Swarbrick

Allardyce summoned as evidence Romelu Lukaku's goal for Everton in West Ham's 2-1 defeat at Goodison Park in November.

'If you go back to Everton away you can see why I'm so angry and frustrated,' he went on. 'Lukaku was stood offside even though the ball ricocheted off our player to him, and that was given onside.

'I'm completely confused and bewildered. There are far too many inconsistencies.

'If we'd been allowed that goal, we wouldn't have lost. One-nil up that early would have kicked the lads on and Arsenal would have found life very difficult from then on.

'It was a real blow and, sadly, we've ended up losing a game that was probably a great spectacle. It was combination of a couple of bad misses and a very poor decision.

Allardyce had no complaints about the penalty given by Swarbrick for a foul by Winston Reid on Santi Cazorla from which Cazorla opened the scoring. Danny Welbeck scored the second and Kouyate pulled one back in the second half.

'Reidy stuck his leg up and he's gone over on it,' said the West Ham manager, but claimed Morgan Amalfitano had been punished for not diving in the penalty area when challenged by Nacho Monreal.

'I just wish Morgan had done similar when he got tugged by Monreal in the last minute. He stayed on his feet. He was being fouled but didn't go down.

'So, there's another scenario for you. Simulation is not nice, but when you don' t get free-kicks for staying on your feet, you're in a difficult situation.'
