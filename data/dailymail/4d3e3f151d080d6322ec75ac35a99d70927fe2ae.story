A college football fan plunged 35 feet to his death from the upper level of the Georgia Dome stadium after falling over the railing as he celebrated a score by his team.

20-year-old Isaac Grubb crashed down onto another fan who was seated on the mezzanine level, suffering blunt force trauma injuries that lead to his death at an Atlanta hospital.

Shocked witnesses described how the tragedy happened as the young man cheered on Tennessee following a touchdown against North Carolina State.

'It looked like [he] was doing a fist pump, and then he was gone over the top,' William Coates told CNN. 'He was just laying there between rows. He wasn't moving. His chest was moving a little.'

Another witness, Kellie Wilborn, told wsbtv.com: 'Everyone's reaction was kind of really freaked out about what happened.

'Everyone tried to run to the side, but security was pushing everyone back and clearing the area out, so people couldn't like look over.'

The fall happened just one day after a
Houston Texans fan died in a similar way. It is not yet known what 
caused Grubb's fall. Investigator Leon Harrison at the Fulton County 
Medical Examiner's Office said an autopsy would be carried out on 
Saturday.

Harrison said the other fan was a man who was subsequently treated at another Atlanta hospital and released. He had no further details on the man's identity or his condition.

Jennifer LeMaster, a spokeswoman for the Georgia World Congress Center Authority, told AP before the death was confirmed by Harrison that she had no information beyond the authority's initial statement.

She said, however, the authority was expected to release more information Saturday afternoon.

The authority had said the fall occurred
about 8:30 p.m. Friday night during the game in which Tennessee beat 
North Carolina 35-21 in the season opener for both teams.

The fall occurred a day after a 25-year-old fan tumbled about 60 feet from a fifth-floor escalator at Reliant Stadium in Houston during a preseason Houston Texans game.

Jonathon Kelly died from the fall during the Thursday night game against the Minnesota Vikings, and frantic witnesses called police to report where his body had landed, police spokesman John Cannon said. Police said the fall appeared to be an accident.

Last year, a firefighter attending a Texas Rangers game in Arlington died when he fell from the left field stands while reaching for a baseball tossed his way by All-Star outfielder Josh Hamilton.

The man's 9-year-old son witnessed the fall. A statue was later dedicated at Rangers Ballpark to the man and his son, and railings were raised throughout the park before this season.

The game was the season opener for both teams, with Tennessee winning 35-21 over North Carolina
