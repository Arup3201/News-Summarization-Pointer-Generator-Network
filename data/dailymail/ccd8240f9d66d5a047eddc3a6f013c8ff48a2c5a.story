Gun salutes sounded across London today to mark the birth of the royal baby as the armed forces join in the celebrations.

The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery and the Honourable Artillery Company carried out the ceremonial royal salutes in honour of the new addition to the royal family.

Gun salutes are fired for the birth of every prince or princess, no matter where their place is in the line of succession. The last royal salute for a birth was for Princess Eugenie in 1990.

Tribute: Artillery fires as part of a 61-gun salute from the Tower of London as the Armed Forces celebrate the birth of the future king

Tradition: The guns were fired in tribute to the newest addition to the Royal Family

The
King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery, wearing full dress uniform, paraded
past Buckingham Palace on the way to Green Park, where they staged a 
41-gun royal salute.

They
went from their forward mounting base in Wellington Barracks into Green
Park, where 71 horses pulled six First World War-era 13-pounder field 
guns into position for the royal salute at 2pm.

Each
of the six guns fired blank artillery rounds at 10-second intervals 
until a total of 41 shots were fired. The horses and riders then 
collected the guns and escorted them back to Wellington Barracks.

Major Mark Edward, commanding officer
of the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery, said: 'The opportunity to 
mark the birth of the child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge by 
firing a 41-gun royal salute, comes as a huge honour for the King's 
Troop Royal Horse Artillery.'

Tribute: The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery let off a 41-gun salute from Green Park near Buckingham Palace

Military: The Army fires a salute every time a Prince or Princess is born - the last one was 23 years ago

The Honourable Artillery Company 
(HAC), the City of London's Army Reserve Regiment, also fired a 62-gun 
salute from Gun Wharf at the Tower of London at 2pm.

Whilst a royal gun salute normally comprises 21 guns, this is increased to 41 if fired from a royal park or residence.

Uniquely,
at the Tower of London, which is a royal residence, 62 rounds are fired
as this also includes an additional 21 guns for the citizens of the 
City of London to show their loyalty to the monarch.

Bells
also sounded at Westminster Abbey in celebration of the royal birth, 
with the three ringers having performed the same task for the new 
Prince's father more than 30 years ago.Â 

Smoke: The drama and pageantry of this afternoon's event was befitting of the royal birth

When the Duke of Cambridge was born 
in June 1982, Clarke Walters helped ring a peal at the iconic church in 
central London in honour of the newest member of the royal family.

Mr Walters said it was 'wonderful' to now be performing the peal for William's own baby son.

He also rang the celebratory bells for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's wedding at the Abbey two years ago.

A
team of 10 from the Westminster Abbey Company of Ringers rang a full 
peal on the Abbey's 10 bells from 2pm to coincide with the gun salute in
Green Park.

The complex peal is made of 5,000 changes, and known as the Cambridge Surprise Royal and lasts for over three hours.

Duty: The artillery were celebrating the arrival of Britain's future King with their traditional salute

March: The soldiers paraded from their base past Buckingham Palace to the gun stations in Green Park

Mr Walters said: 'It's always a great honour to ring at the Abbey especially for a big occasion like this one. It's a bit of a thrill even though I've been ringing for more than 30 years.

'I do love the connection that three of us rang the peal for William's birth, the same three were in the wedding peal and the same three are here today. That's a nice link back to William.'

Celebrations are not confined to London, as all of Her Majesty's ships - in home or international waters - are flying the Royal Navy Ensign flag from their mast to mark the birth of the prince.

HMS Lancaster, deployed on a patrol task in the Caribbean, added its own congratulatory message to the Duke and Duchess, spelling out 'It's A Boy!' on the deck of the ship.

Commanding officer Commander Steve Moorhouse said: 'As "the Queen's Frigate" we were particularly delighted to hear the fantastic news of the royal birth and everybody on board HMS Lancaster sends their warmest congratulations and best wishes to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.'

Majestic: The military horses flooded in to Green Park in the early afternoon today

Special moment: This is the first time in 23 years that the salute has been fired for a Royal birth

Staff from RAF Valley, where Prince 
William serves as a search and rescue pilot, were among the first to 
offer their congratulations.

Station commander Group Captain Adrian Hill sent a congratulatory message to the couple on behalf of the RAF Valley.

'We're
all delighted to learn that Flight Lieutenant Wales and the Duchess of 
Cambridge are now proud parents of a new-born son,' he said.

'We wish them all the very best for the future. From everyone at RAF Valley, congratulations.'

Preparation: Earlier this month the Honourable Artillery Company were pictured cleaning their guns

Hard at work: They polished the guns to ensure they would be sparkling for the salute

The Ministry of Defence said other units connected to WIlliam also marked the birth, including the Army regiment he was commissioned into from Sandhurst, the Household Cavalry, which is partly deployed in Afghanistan.

The Irish Guards, of which William is the colonel, toasted the birth with a traditional glass of Irish stout at their barracks in Aldershot and at bases in London.

Kate visited the battalion this year and last year to present shamrocks to all ranks on St Patrick's Day, a role carried out for many years by a female member of the Royal Family.

Commanding officer Lieutenant Colonel Ed Boanas said: 'On behalf of all ranks 1st Battalion Irish Guards, I send our warmest congratulations and best wishes to the Colonel of the Regiment and HRH the Duchess of Cambridge on the occasion of the birth of their son, with the heartfelt hope that he has a long and happy life. Quis Separabit (who will separate us?).'

Marker: The fountains in Trafalgar Square will be coloured blue for the rest of the week after the Royal birth

Not long now: Members of the press are forced to wait in the pouring rain for the first glimpse of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their newborn son outside St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, west London, today

Trafalgar Square's famous fountains were lit with blue lights last night and London mayor Boris Johnson said they will be lit for the next six days in celebration of the royal birth.

'Huge congratulations to the Duke and Duchess on the birth of their first child who will, by virtue of being born in this great city, be a Londoner through and through,' he said.

'I am sure millions of Londoners will be raising a glass today to toast this wonderful news.'

Westminster City Council celebrated the announcement of the baby boy's birth with blue lighting in the fountains in Marble Arch and the Golden Jubilee Bridge. They will remain lit up until midnight tonight.

Council leader Philippa Roe said: 'Just like everyone else around the country, we are obviously thrilled at the news. We also give a special welcome to our latest Westminster arrival and, of course, add our congratulations to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.

'We will be working with Kensington Palace to register the birth of the baby.'
