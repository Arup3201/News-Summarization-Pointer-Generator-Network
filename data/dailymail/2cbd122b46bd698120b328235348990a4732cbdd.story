A woman has described the horrifying side effects she experienced after having black market butt injections.

In ‘Buttloads of Pain’, a documentary produced by Vice, Oscarina Busse, 35, from Miami, Florida, admits that the illegal fillers made her skin crust, ‘peel like an onion,’ and droop.

She was forced to undergo life-saving surgery that saw more than three pounds of rotted, rock-hard flesh removed from her derriere.

Forever changed: Oscarina Busse (pictured) received two butt-enhancing treatments that resulted in a near-death medical condition

Lethal behind: A majority of dancers at Miami's King of Diamonds strip club (including the one shown above) have received the same illegal injections that caused Oscarina Busse (not pictured above) serious medical issues

The hair salon owner had paid approximately $6,000 for her two augmenting treatments that cost nearly $70,000 to repair - with additional procedures still on the way.

Ms Busse, a mother of one, chose the illegal injection rather than its legalized fat transfer or implant counterparts for its comparably cheaper cost ($3,000 versus up to $13,000 for the legal version) and short recovery time.

The practice is becoming commonplace, even an epidemic, in Ms Busse’s native Miami - a location whose body-obsessed culture makes most women unhappy with their bodies, she says.

‘It wasn’t because I didn’t have it. I just wanted it to be better’

As a Dominican woman, Ms Busse says that she already had a curvy figure before the shots. ‘It wasn’t because I didn’t have it. I just wanted it to be better.’ she said of the reason behind receiving her butt enhancements.

Ms Busse received her first round of shots in 2002 followed by another round in 2009, the latter of which turned out to be a nearly-fatal experience.

Like many women, Ms Busse did not receive either treatment from a licensed medical professional. Instead, she received the injections at a ‘spa’ that she found through word-of-mouth.

‘I got the shots and six months later my butt turned purple, the product had eaten off my muscle, and my skin peeled like an onion,’ she said of her body’s reaction.

According to Vice, those who receive illegal butt injections rarely know what substance is really being implanted into their bodies.

The most typical materials used are mineral oil and non-medical-grade silicone, but there have been reports of Fix-A-Flat tire remedies or concrete being injected too. Some of the most notorious butt ‘doctors’ have even used Krazy Glue to help seal the syringe entry spot, to stop the caustic materials from leaking out, the film says.

Ms Busse is not sure what caused her reaction, but it seems like hers occurred much sooner than the norm.

Many women begin to experience something similar within five to ten years after their own procedures, as her plastic surgeon explained.

Ms Busse kept her condition a secret for months before finally sharing her pain with a client, showing her the predicament in the privacy of a salon back room.

In an accompanying article, Vice writes, ‘her a** was rotting off.’

The client’s reaction prompted Ms Busse to seek out help.

After consulting many doctors who would not treat her out of fear that she may eventually die anyway, Ms Busse found Dr Constantino Mendieta – a Miami-based plastic surgeon who specializes in butt surgeries.

Dr Mendieta told Vice that while many women 'will turn to any measure' to achieve a more perfect butt, 'many of these patrients may die over time because of the injections that they are getting.''

He says that the injections 'destroy' body tissue, and that receiving them is a 'lifetime event that you'll never be able to change back [completely].'

By Ms Busse’s own accounts, Dr Mendieta saved her life. Her condition was one of the worst he had seen in his career, and required such extensive surgery that it was broken down into two rounds of procedures.

'I had to cut a great deal of flesh out with the silicone because it had impregnated her tissue,' he said of her first surgery.

'We pulled out a pound and a half of pure, rock-hard substance from each cheek,' he elaborated, of the $70,000 procedure.

The silicone material allegedly used 
in Ms Busse’s butt injections was first invented during the Second World 
War as a transformer fluid.

Prostitutes in Yokohama, Japan began to steal the solution from the docks of U.S. marine bases to inject it into their breasts. A trend began, landing inside the bodies of sex workers and First Ladies (like Nancy Reagan) alike.

But in 1965, when it was discovered how silicone has a propensity to travel within the body, attach itself to organs, trigger strong autoimmune reactions, and potentially cause lethal septic shock, the solution was outlawed from medical use.

It then became a strictly-underground pursuit, often favored by transsexuals, Vice says.

Ms Busse is by no means the only woman to undergo illegal butt injections.

In
its report, Vice visits a Miami strip club where it’s estimated that 
75 to 80per cent of the dancers have received such treatments.

Worth the risk: Miami-based stripper, 'Seven', says that her injections are worth the risk because of the amount of money she now making because of them

While
 these women’s backsides are culturally perceived as attractive thanks 
to their treatments, it is likely that in five to ten years’ time they 
could suffer a predicament similar to Ms Busse’s.

But that risk is worthwhile, according to a dancer who goes by ‘Seven'.

She said: 'I got my butt done on a Tuesday. I came back to work on a Friday and made triple the amount it cost in one night. My money went from regular stripper to superior stripper.'

If Ms Busse’s surgeries are any indication, Seven should probably start saving, as Doctor Mendieta - one of Miami's few surgeons willing to repair the injections' destruction - does not come on the cheap.
