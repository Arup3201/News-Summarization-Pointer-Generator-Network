Care: Andrew Marr required full-time care in the months after his stroke. His wife of 26 years said he was reduced to a 'half-paralysed invalid'

When broadcaster Andrew Marr suffered a massive stroke which left him a ‘half-paralysed invalid’, his life changed overnight.

Yesterday his wife revealed for the first time the huge impact his sudden illness had on her - and made a heartfelt plea for greater support for Britain’s carers.

Jackie Ashley, 58, gave up work for six months to become a full-time carer for her husband while he recovered from the stroke which almost killed him.

She told how ‘exhausting, monotonous and frustrating’ she found aspects of caring for him during his recuperation, but said it had also given her a better perspective on life.

The mother-of-three said: ‘I am no Florence Nightingale and there’s no damn halo visible when I look in the mirror: this is just what any decent relative would do for someone who is physically disabled.

‘One stroke victim wrote to tell me he thought that carers for stroke sufferers all experience some kind of post-traumatic stress disorder.

‘I wouldn’t go that far, but it can be tough, and carers everywhere need support and breaks.’

Mr Marr, 53, suffered a serious stroke in January this year which damaged his left arm and leg, leaving him needing intensive physiotherapy.

Doctors warned his wife he might not survive the bleeding in his brain and that if he lived he could be left unable to move, see, speak or hear.

Following months of rehabilitation, he is now preparing to return to broadcasting full-time next month.

While his voice and memory are intact, he said his walking was still ‘a bit wobbly’.

Miss Ashley, his wife of 26 years, has also returned to her work as a columnist for the Guardian newspaper, and described the dramatic impact the stroke had on the couple’s lives.

he said: ‘He went from being a super-energetic, fit, over-worker to a half-paralysed invalid.

‘His life had totally changed, but of course, as many kind friends have pointed out, mine had too... I had never been a full-time carer.

‘It is, above all, exhausting. It can also be extremely monotonous and frustrating for both the patient and the carer.’

Miss Ashley praised ‘brilliant support’ given to her husband from doctors, nurses and physiotherapists during his time in hospital.

Challenging: Jackie Ashley said her life changed after her husband's stroke, and the support they were given in hospital stopped once they returned home

But she said the level of support for stroke victims dropped dramatically once they left hospital, despite an ongoing need for occupational and physiotherapy.

She called for greater flexibility from employers to cope with the growing need for workers to take time off to care for elderly parents and other relatives.

Around six million people, or one in eight adults in Britain are carers, according to Carers UK.

Half of those juggle care commitments with work, but the demands of caring mean that one in five eventually have to give up working, according to the charity.

By 2037, it estimates that the number of carers in Britain will increase to nine million.

Miss Ashley, the daughter of Labour peer Lord Ashley of Stoke, the first deaf MP, said many people became carers ‘out of the blue’ after an illness or accident left a relative needing help.

She said: ‘The world of work is not set up to deal with this. Too many older women lose their jobs after a few months off to care for an elderly parent, or other relative.

Return: Andrew Marr is due to resume full-time broadcasting in September

‘Just as we now accept that women need to take some time out for childcare, surely we should be able to re-arrange the world of work so that “carer’s leave” becomes a normal part of all our lives, men included.’

Carers UK chief executive Heléna Herklots (corr) said a recent study had found the cost to the economy of carers who were forced to give up work was around £1.3billion per year.

One in seven employees currently juggles full-time work with a care commitment, she said.

She added: ‘As the population ages more and more of us will become carers. This is one of society’s biggest challenges.

‘If people are forced to give up work there’s a loss to the economy because they may need benefits and support, and they won’t be paying taxes.

‘If employers can support people to carry on working then they are not losing valuable employees, and they don’t have to recruit to replace them.’

Mr Marr has spoken movingly of the support he has received from his wife and their children Harry, 23, Isabel, 21, and 18-year-old Emily, saying: ‘Jackie saved my life. Without her, I wouldn’t be here... I was saved by my family.’

He also said he was happier since the stroke, as it had given him a better perspective on his previously ‘brittle, narrow, overstressed life’.

Miss Ashley said it had also changed her attitudes, saying: ‘I have become aware of just how fragile life is.

‘We walk in the sunlight, ignoring the shadows. In the blink of an eye lives can be changed utterly... There is nothing like a near-death experience to put life’s little annoyances into perspective and to learn to live each day for the day.’
