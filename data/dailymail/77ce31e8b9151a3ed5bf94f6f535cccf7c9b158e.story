The Vatican has announced that it was sent a £72,000 ransom demand for two letters written by Renaissance master Michelangelo who painted the Sistine Chapel.

Spokesman Father Federico Lombardi said a cardinal in charge of St Peter's Basilica, which Michelangelo also helped to design, had been offered the documents for 'a certain price'.

Rome newspaper Il Messaggero said the person, described as a former Vatican employee, had asked for 100,000 euros (£72,000).

The Vatican said a cardinal was sent a ransom demand asking for £72,000 to return two letters by Renaissance master Michelangelo (pictured, St Peter's Basilica, which the artist helped to design)

This is the first time the Vatican has acknowledged the theft of the two letters, one of which supposedly contains Michelangelo's signature.

Lombardi said the cardinal 'naturally refused because these are stolen documents'.

He added that a nun who worked in the Vatican archives informed officials back in 1997 that the documents had gone missing, but he did not say why the Vatican had not disclosed the theft before.

While the newspaper spoke of only one letter signed by Michelangelo, who lived from 1475 to 1564, the spokesman said two documents had gone missing.

He added that Vatican police were now investigating the case with their Italian counterparts.

No further details have been given about either of the documents, which were taken from the archives of the Fabbrica di San Pietro which looks after the upkeep of the basilica.

The demand is believed to have come from a former Vatican employee. Until a spokesman confirmed the threat, it was not known that the documents had been taken back in 1997

However, The Times reports the signed letter is believed to discuss art commissioned by the Pope.

The archives contain numerous documents concerning the history, design and construction of vast holy site. The basilica took more than 100 years to build and was completed in 1626.

Michelangelo took over the construction of the basilica in January 1547, while in his seventies, after the death of Pope Paul III's preferred candidate, Giulio Romano.

Drawing on the complex plans laid down by a chain of architects before him, Michelangelo brought them together into a workable model, and is responsible for much of the basilica as it stands today.
