A mass walkout by NHS staff including some paramedics and emergency workers next week could cost lives, the Health Secretary warned last night.

In a blunt warning to the unions, Jeremy Hunt said the planned 12-hour strike next Thursday ‘has the potential to affect patient safety to an unacceptable level, especially at a time of intense winter pressures’.

Five health unions, representing hundreds of thousands of NHS staff, are threatening to walk out next week in a long-running dispute over pay. A further 24-hour strike is planned next month.

Talks to avert the strikes broke up inconclusively last night, but will resume this evening.

But health sources said there was no more money for pay – and warned that meeting the unions’ demands would cost thousands of jobs.

Mr Hunt warned the unions that patients will die unless they agree to guarantee emergency cover on a national basis during the strikes, but was unable to secure an agreement.

It means that, at present, there is no deal to provide ambulance cover for 999 calls, or to respond to national emergencies, such as a terrorist attack.

In a letter to union leaders last night Mr Hunt warned of the danger the strike poses to patients.

He said: ‘Today I have received a letter from NHS England advising me of their concerns that your current plans will pose a real risk that patients with life threatening conditions are harmed.’

The unions – which have all attacked the government over NHS performance during the winter – also risk charges of hypocrisy by urging their members to walk out at a time when the service is stretched to the limit.

The Unison union, which is leading negotiations, last night said union leaders would meet this lunchtime to consider providing emergency cover. They will then hold further talks with Mr Hunt this evening.

Christina McAnea, head of health at Unison, last night said the unions ‘share the government’s concerns about patient safety and hope we can have sensible discussions tomorrow on how to resolve this dispute’.

She said it was encouraging that the talks are continuing, but voiced concern about the Government’s refusal to increase the overall pay offer.

The strikes were called after Mr Hunt ruled last year that a recommended one per cent pay rise should not be paid in full. Around 600,000 NHS workers in line for an automatic pay ‘increment’ will not also receive the one per cent.

The strike is potentially embarrassing for Labour, as it involves the party’s three biggest donors, Unison, Unite and the GMB.

Between them the three unions have given Labour an astonishing £25 million since Mr Miliband became party leader.

Labour has refused to condemn the planned strikes – and is pressing ministers to cave in to the unions’ demands on pay.

But Mr Hunt warned last night that the pay demands would cost the NHS an extra £450 million – equivalent to the cost of employing 14,000 newly-qualified nurses.

‘At a time when the NHS is under unprecedented pressure, it would be totally wrong to consider any pay policy which would have the effect of forcing the local NHS to employ less staff, which would inevitably have a serious impact on patient care.’

Talks today are expected to focus on redistributing the overall pay increase among NHS workers. A health source said the Government ‘cannot afford to increase the overall NHS pay bill’.
