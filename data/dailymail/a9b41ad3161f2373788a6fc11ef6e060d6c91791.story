Education Secretary Michael Gove said children needed longer school days and shorter holidays to keep pace with other countries

The traditional long summer school holiday is a relic of the 19th century and must be consigned to history, Michael Gove declared yesterday.

The Education Secretary said it was wrong that terms were still scheduled for a time when children were needed to help out on farms and most mothers stayed at home.

And he warned of more strikes ahead, accusing unions of lacking ambition and putting the needs of teachers before those of children in their care.

Some schools have already overhauled their term patterns, abolishing the long six-week summer break.

But Mr Gove wants every school to follow suit, with longer days and shorter holidays.

He told an education conference: ‘We can’t afford an education system that was essentially set in the nineteenth century.’

The government has previously suggested the school day could be extended to last from 7.30am to 5.30pm, boosting learning and making it easier for parents to go to work.

Mr Gove said ‘some of the best schools in the country’ recognise the need to change the structure of the school term and move to a longer school day.

New powers for headteachers to pay good teachers more could also be used to increase school hours, he said.

He also promised to tackle 'one or two legislative or bureaucratic obstacles' which stop all schools modernising their hours.

‘It’s
 consistent with the pressures of a modern society.  I also think it’s 
going to be family friendly,’ Mr Gove told the event organised by the 
Spectator magazine.

Ministers believe the change could herald cheaper holidays if term times are staggered while working parents would benefit from not having to take time off or find childcare for weeks on end.

Should summer holidays for schoolchildren be shortened?

Under the current system, the school year is 190 days long.

Pupils get around six weeks off in summer, two weeks at Christmas and Easter as well as three half-term breaks lasting a week each.

School days usually run from around 9am to 3pm, or 3.30pm.

But the Department for Education said a number of academies - which are free from local authority control - are already altering the length of the school day.

Mr Gove said: ‘The structure of the school term and the school day was designed at a time when we had an agricultural economy.

‘I
 remember half term in October when I was at school in Aberdeen was 
called the tattie holiday - the period when kids would go to the fields 
to pick potatoes. It was also at a time when the majority of mums stayed
 home. 

‘That world no 
longer exists, and we can’t afford to have an education system that was 
essentially, set in the nineteenth century.’

Two evacuees, Robert Yoghill and William Williams from Islington in London learn how to milk the cows by Eileen Hocking on her family farm in Cornwall. Mr Gove said long school holidays date back to schoolchildren working in an agriculture economy

Mr Gove's drive to overhaul school hours is backed by David Cameron.

The
 Prime Minister's official spokesman pointed to the need to 'reform a 
whole series of parts of our education system to reflect the very modern
 global race that the UK is in'.

A Whitehall source added: 'We can either start working as hard as the Chinese, or we'll all soon be working for the Chinese.'

In a speech Mr Gove said that pupils are 
at a 'significant handicap' compared to youngsters in East Asian nations
 who benefit from extra tuition and support from teachers.

What is now known as six weeks of sun, fun and holidays were not always so.

The summer break and other school holidays were during spring planting and early autumn harvests children were needed at home.

They would help with the work in the fields or in the house during the busiest time of the agricultural calendar.

Other
 breaks in the school year would often be for financial reasons as 
schools would shut due to lack funding to pay for coal to heat up the 
classrooms in wintertime.

Mr Gove said: 'One of the striking 
things about East Asia is that they do not have what we have in England,
 is the automatic assumption that you divide children into the achievers
 and the others, the academic and the vocational. 

'They
 believe that every child can be educated. The assumption is that all 
children at every year will absorb and learn the curriculum. And their 
expectations are higher than in this country.

'School
 days are longer, school holidays are shorter. The expectation is that 
to succeed, hard work is at the heart of everything.

'And
 if you look at the length of the school day in England, the length of 
the summer holiday – and we compare it to the extra tuition and support 
that children are receiving elsewhere - then we are fighting or actually
 running in this global race in a way that ensures that we start with a 
significant handicap.'

However, teaching unions were quick to reject the idea of longer hours being of benefit to pupils.

Earlier this month the National Union
 of Teachers (NUT) demanded teachers spend just four hours a day in 
classrooms, complaining school staff are facing 'totally unsustainable' 
workloads.

Some schools have already moved to longer hours and fewer holidays (file picture)

NUT general 
secretary Christine Blower hit out at Mr Gove's proposal. She said: 
'Teachers and pupils already spend longer hours in the classroom than 
most countries and also have some of the shortest summer holidays.

'Independent
 schools in England and Wales, which often break for two weeks more 
during the summer and have longer holidays at other times of the year 
than their state counterparts, do not apparently feel the need to change
 and are apparently not suffering from their reduced hours.

'Yet again we see the Education Secretary making policy up on the hoof with no real evidence for either the necessity for change or the benefit it brings.'

Mr Gove said the school holidays system was set for a time when children were needed to help on farms

Brian Lightman, general secretary of 
the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), said: 'Some 
schools are introducing innovative changes to the school day and term 
and it will be interesting to see what effect these have in the longer 
term on achievement.

'But changes should be based on 
sound, researched evidence, not on anecdotes from other countries with 
vastly different cultures and attitudes to education.

'The quality of the learning 
happening in classrooms when children are in school is more important 
than the number of hours they spend there.'

But Mr Gove also renewed his attack on 
teaching unions, accusing them of fostering a ‘culture of low 
expectations’ which is holding children back.

He
 added: ‘One of the tragedies of our time is that the teaching unions 
have chosen to put the interests of adults, ahead of the needs of our 
children. And that is why sadly, the unions, as a voice of teachers is 
diminishing.

‘My challenge not to teachers, but to teaching unions – is to do a better job.’

Asked
 if Britain was facing more strikes in schools, he replied: ‘Yes. There 
seems to be a competition between the NUT and NASUWT to compete for 
members, with each one trying to out radical the other.

‘I think that this is a golden opportunity for teachers to prove what they can achieve.’

He urged the unions to set up a Free School, offering to find them a building and provide funding.
