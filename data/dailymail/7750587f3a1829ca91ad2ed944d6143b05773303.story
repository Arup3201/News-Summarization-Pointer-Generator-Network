Disgraced mom: Nicole McMillen, 44, seen in a 2012 booking photo, was sentenced Friday to three years and four months in prison for molesting her son's two teenage friends

A married middle-aged school employee from California was sentenced Friday to more than three years in a state prison for sexually molesting her teenage son's friends.

Nicole McMillen, a 44-year-old mother of three from Irvine, was also ordered to register as a lifetime sex offender.

McMillen, who had worked as a behavioral specialist at Tustin schools, was convicted last October of four counts of lewd acts on a child and three counts of oral copulation of a minor under 16.

According to the prosecution, the married woman was keeping a 'fun' home where her children's school friends could come and play video games and watch TV.

An investigation has revealed that in January and February 2012, Mrs McMillen assaulted a 14-year-old boy who came to her house in a gated community in Irvine, repeatedly touching his groin over the pants and performing oral sex on him, the station KTLA reported.

When the boy's parents learned of the incident and filed a complaint with police, investigators discovered a second victim, a 16-year-old. 

During her 
trial last fall, prosecutors said that the married mother of three 
carried on a year-long affair with the older boy between 2005 and 2006.

Marked for life: McMillen, a former behavioral specialist and married mother of three, was ordered to register as a lifetime sex offender

During her sentencing Friday at North Justice Center in Fullerton, the 44-year-old McMillen showed little emotion. Her husband, Joseph McMillen, and parents sat in the audience during the proceedings.

Nicole McMillen's attorney, Salvatore Ciulla, had asked for a probation sentence for his client in light of the fact that she already had served 296 days in jail.

But Judge James Rogan rejected the defense's request, saying that the disgraced wife and mother had shown no remorse and continued to deny her wrongdoings.

The convicted child molester could be released early because of prison overcrowding. 

At the time of the incidents McMillen was working part-time with kindergarten-age kids at Peters Canyon Elementary School and as a behavioral interventionist with the Tustin Unified School District.
