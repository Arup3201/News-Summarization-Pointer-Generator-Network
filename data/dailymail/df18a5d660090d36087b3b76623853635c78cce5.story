A growing digital lynch mob of Twitter users is calling for street justice against George Zimmerman and advocating he be murdered since his release from jail on $150,000 bail early this morning. Some have even threatened to kill the neighborhood watch volunteer themselves.

The public menace against Zimmerman is not new. His family said he has received 'thousands' of death threats since he shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin February 26 in a gated community in Sanford, Florida.

For this reason he was promptly whisked away to a secret location after he walked out of jail. He has been in hiding ever since the shooting, which erupted into a racially-charged national controversy.

The threats come as his lawyer says he regrets letting Zimmerman take the stand Friday to apologize for Trayvon's death and said he wouldn't have done it, had he known the teen's parents wouldn't have taken it well.

Threats: Dozens of profane Tweets threatened George Zimmerman flooded Twitter after the neighborhood watch volunteer was released from jail

Sprung: George Zimmerman is now in hiding after his release from jail in Seminole County, Florida, after he posted bail

The vitriol on Twitter became dozens 
of violent threats ever since a judge agreed Friday to set Zimmerman's 
bail at $150,000. Zimmerman, 28, is charged with second-degree murder in
 the killing, but was not deemed a flight risk.

Twitchy,
 a right-leaning blog that tracks Twitter traffic, published several of 
the threats. Many were since taken down, but more continue to pour in.

A user named Jordan Irving wrote: 'They let this n**** Zimmerman out of jail?! Somebody kill this dude already!'

Another, called Uncle Phil, said: 'I say kill Zimmerman b****.'

Chatia said: 'someone pass me a gun, imma go follow zimmerman, shoot and kill him and say #imstandingmyground.'

'They done let Zimmerman free lets kill that MF,' Louis David Jr wrote.

'If I go kill zimmerman how much time will I get?or will they let me out on bond?' Kenish.

According to Twitchy, a user called Taylor said: 'Ima kill zimmerman myself *loads semi* where he at.'

Twitter's policy says such comments 
are against its policy: 'Violence and Threats: You may not publish or 
post direct, specific threats of violence against others.'

This compilation of tweets, compiled by Mail Online, shows just a few of the vitriolic messages sent out after Zimmerman was let out of jail

Out: Zimmerman was wearing a brown jacket and 
blue jeans and carrying a paper bag. It's not known where he will stay 
until his trial in the murder of Trayvon Martin

Meanwhile, Zimmerman's lawyer, Mark O'Mara, told This Morning on CBS that he regrets letting his client apologize for killing Trayvon during his bond hearing. 

Trayvon's parents did not respond well to the apology. Their lawyer, Benjamin Crump said: 'The apology was somewhat of a surprise because we had told them this was not the appropriate time, but they just disregarded that, and he went and pandered to the court and the media and gave a very insincere apology.'

O'Mara said, in retrospect, the apology was a mistake.

'To be honest, had I known that... I'm not sure that we would have done it at the bond hearing, because the purpose of it truly was to get to the family and to respond directly to the family's request.,' he said.

'Had I known or been told that that wasn't the time, it wouldn't have happened. So, I apologize for that.'

Ride: Zimmerman met a man in a white BMW and drove away from the jail to an unknown location

he extraordinary step to speak out at the court hearing Friday saying: 'I wanted to say I am sorry for the loss of your son. I did not know how old he was. I thought he was a little bit younger than I am, and I did not know if he was armed or not.'

Zimmerman was led out of Seminole County Jail shortly after midnight Sunday and driven away to a secret location.

Seminole
 County Circuit Court Judge Kenneth Lester determined last week that 
Zimmerman is not a risk to the community, despite being charged with 
second-degree murder in the death of the unarmed teen in February.

Zimmerman was granted bond of $150,000 on Thursday, much less than the $1 million asked for by the state of Florida.

Shortly after midnight Sunday, he
 was seen leaving the jail wearing a brown jacket and blue jeans and 
carrying a paper bag. He met a man in a white BMW and drove away.

His ultimate destination is being kept secret for his safety and it could be outside Florida.

Judge
 Lester said at a hearing Friday he cannot have any guns and must 
observe a 7pm-to-6am curfew. Zimmerman also surrendered his passport.

Zimmerman had to put up 10 per cent, or $15,000, to make bail. His father had indicated he might take out a second mortgage.

Walking out: Zimmerman's ultimate destination is being kept secret for his safety and it is very likely outside of Florida

Zimmerman worked at a mortgage risk-management company at the time of the shooting and his wife is in nursing school.

A website was set up to collect donations for Zimmerman's defense fund. It is unclear how much has been raised.

Bail is not unheard of in second-degree murder cases, and legal experts had predicted it would be granted for Zimmerman because of his ties to the community, because he turned himself in after he was charged last week, and because he has never been convicted of a serious crime.

Speaking at his bail hearing, Zimmerman, 28, apologised to Trayvon's parents, coming face-to-face
 with the victim's family for the first time. He said: ‘I am sorry for 
the loss of your son… I did not know if he was armed or not.’

Addressing Trayvon Martin's family directly Zimmerman said: 'I did not know how old he was. I thought he was a little bit older than I was'.

The 28-year-old is charged with second degree murder for the February 26 killing of the 17-year-old.

Getting situated: George Zimmerman took to the witness stand for the first time on Friday

While on the stand, the prosecution 
asked why Zimmerman waited so long to contact Martin’s parents.

Zimmerman said he was told not to by his own lawyer.

‘I
 was told not to communicate,’ he said. Zimmerman sat stiffly while 
testifying, keeping his expression blank and blinking frequently.

Circuit Judge Kenneth Lester set several conditions Friday for Zimmerman's release.

He cannot have any firearms, drink alcohol or use drugs and must observe a curfew.

He will also have a GPS monitoring device.

He was questioned for about five minutes before the judge dismissed him from the stand.

Zimmerman's case may have improved slightly with the release of a new photograph, showing the back of Zimmerman's bleeding head following the incident.

The photo, obtained and released exclusively by ABC News, shows blood trickling from the crown of Zimmerman's head. ABC News notes that the blood is likely coming from two gashes.

The police report from the night of February 26 also noted that Zimmerman was bleeding from his nose.

However, Zimmerman was not sent to the hospital, nor did he receive stitches. Rather, he was treated by paramedics and brought in for questioning.

Zimmerman, who has not spoken publicly since the shooting, told police that he spotted Martin as he was patrolling his neighbourhood and called 911 to report a suspicious person.

'This guy looks like he is up to no good. He is on drugs or something,' Zimmerman told the dispatcher from his sport utility vehicle.

He added that the teen had his hand in his waistband and was walking around looking at homes.'These a*******. They always get away,' Zimmerman said on a 911 call.

But Trayvon was not armed. He was returning from a convenience store with an iced tea for himself and a bag of skittles for his little brother.

A neighbour said there had been several break-ins in the community in the past year, including one in which burglars took a TV and laptops.

A dispatcher told Zimmerman to stay in his sport utility vehicle and that an officer would be there momentarily, but Zimmerman - for unknown reasons - got out.

Zimmerman told police he lost sight of the teenager and was walking back to his sport utility vehicle when he was suddenly attacked.

He claims he shot the teen in self-defence.
