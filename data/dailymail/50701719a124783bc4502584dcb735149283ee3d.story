Taxpayers’ handouts to massive ‘ugly’ solar farms which scar the countryside are to be axed by Environment Secretary Liz Truss.

She will tell farmers tomorrow to stop pocketing public funds by carpeting large parts of the landscape with the black panels – and go back to growing fruit, vegetables and crops instead.

The move, to take effect from January, is the latest part of David Cameron’s attempt to move away from green politics.

Ms Truss said: ‘I want Britain to lead the world in food and farming and to do that we need enough productive agricultural land.

‘I’m very concerned that a lot of our land is being taken up with solar farms. We’ve already got 250 of them and we’ve got 10,000 football pitches worth of new solar farms in the pipeline.

‘They are ugly, a blight on the countryside, and villages are pushing production of meat and other traditional British produce overseas.

‘Food and farming is our number one manufacturing industry, the whole food chain represents £100 billion in our economy, and it is a real problem if we are using productive agricultural land for solar farms.

‘I’m not against them per se – they’re fine on commercial roofs and school roofs – but it’s a big problem if we are using land that can be used to grow crops, fruit and vegetables. We import two-thirds of our apples, and using more land for solar panels makes it harder to improve that.’

The boom in solar farms in recent years has been fuelled by big grants from Whitehall and Brussels that have seen landowners pocket up to £50,000 a year. It has led to claims that they are becoming ‘the new onshore wind’ after growing criticism of giant wind turbines.

Ms Truss’s initiative comes amid claims by Tory officials that the party is to dump the colour green from its official leaflets. A green doodled oak tree logo replaced the Conservatives’ traditional torch in 2006, a year after Cameron became leader, in an attempt to give them an eco-friendly image.

However, the Prime Minister’s enthusiasm for ‘green power’ has dimmed with growing scepticism about the speed of climate change and a growing backlash against the appearance and energy efficiency of wind turbines and solar farms.

Mr Cameron, who once vowed to lead the ‘greenest government ever’, publicly promised to ‘roll back’ green taxes, which add more than £100 a year to average fuel bills.

And, to the horror of environmental campaigners, his message in private is said to have been more blunt. He reportedly told a colleague: ‘We’ve got to get rid of all this green c**p.’

The Tory mantra of the early days of Cameron’s leadership – ‘Vote blue, go green’ – has rarely been uttered by Ministers in recent months.

The solar power industry costs the taxpayer an estimated £600 million a year. Some of the subsidies are funded by channelling money from household fuel bills, prompting claims that ordinary families are bankrolling wealthy landowners.

Ms Truss is to end grants of £2 million a year available via her department from the European Union’s Common Agriculture Policy. The grants are worth up to £100 an acre.

Ministers at the Department of Energy and Climate Change announced earlier this year that solar- farm grants from their budget will also be slashed. There has been huge growth in large solar projects since 2012. Two years ago there were just 46, but the total has soared to about 200 this year, with another 200 awaiting planning permission.

The Tories have already promised not to subsidise any new onshore wind farms if they win next year’s Election with an outright majority.

She played the role of Maggie at age of 8...and she might just follow her into No10

Environment Secretary Liz Truss who played Margaret Thatcher in a school election in 1983

It is difficult to top the Thatcherite credentials of high-flying Cabinet Minister Liz Truss. After all, she made her first pro-Maggie speech as an eight-year-old schoolgirl at West Primary School in Paisley, in Labour’s Scottish heartlands.

‘I was Margaret Thatcher in the school election during the 1983 General Election,’ she says, laughing at her own precociousness.

As a debating debut, it was not a triumph. In the real General Election, Margaret Thatcher won a landslide victory over the hapless Michael Foot, but at West Primary it was a different story. ‘I got no votes – and I didn’t even vote for myself!’

Why not? ‘I was indoctrinated by my parents and didn’t believe in it.’

Truss’s mother and father were dyed-in-the-wool Lefties who took her on Ban The Bomb marches and had her singing anti-Thatcher songs.

They even helped write her classroom address. Perhaps that is why her classmates were unconvinced.

By the time she was a teenager, Truss decided her parents were wrong about Maggie.

‘I just had this – it’s hard to analyse it going back… but I always had this fascination with her,’ she says, as we chat during our interview in her Whitehall office.

‘I just thought there was something interesting about what she was doing. There was a lot of negativity about Britain’s future, the Left were very pro-Europe and anti-American. I was fascinated by America and thought, “Actually, this country doesn’t sound that bad”.’

Truss’s appointment as Environment Secretary in July marked a meteoric rise for the 39-year-old mother of two. After primary school in Scotland she went to a comprehensive in Leeds – her accent is more Yorkshire than Yah.

Brainbox Truss got two, not one maths A-levels. An Oxford degree and career as an oil industry economist followed.

In 2010, she finally won an election on a Thatcherite platform, becoming MP for Norfolk North West.

Just four years later, she inherited the Environment post when Owen Paterson was sacked by David Cameron.

Huntin’-shootin’-and-fishin’ Tory reactionary Paterson thought Truss, with her Laura Ashley hues and trendy ‘Cameroon’ friends, was better suited to pink designer Hunter boots worn by yummy-mummies than green ones worn by proper country folk.

Yet anyone who thought she would call off his crusade against eco-warriors may be proved wrong, as she showed by using our interview to announce a crackdown on ugly solar farms.

I carry out a mini eco audit of Ms Truss. ‘We have eco light bulbs and I’m very frugal,’ she says, lowering her voice and leaning forward to stress each vowel, evoking another frugal blonde Tory who outraged the Left by saying she hoarded baked beans in her kitchen cupboard.

I don’t mention her name, Thatcher. There’s no need.

‘We have lots of roadside stands in Norfolk where you can just pick up vegetables that people have grown in their garden and put the money in a pot.’

I’m not sure I want to get her started on turnips! (When Truss was selected as a Parliamentary candidate, the less than progressive squirearchy of Norfolk got into a prurient stew over a brief extramarital fling she had had – prompting headlines about the ‘Turnip Taliban’.)

‘Turnips are a very tasty option,’ she chuckles, though it was no laughing matter at the time. Truss is now happily settled with husband Hugh and their two daughters, aged eight and five.

Never mind buying vegetables, does townie Truss, who constantly tells farmers to grow more fruit and veg, get her manicured fingers dirty and practise what she preaches? ‘I keep the water butt full, we’ve grown tomatoes, runner beans, raspberries, cherries, I’ve put two gooseberry bushes in and planted two apple trees in the garden.’

What about her work-life balance? Did she read her daughters a bedtime story last night? ‘I did actually, Hilaire Belloc’s Cautionary Tales.’

Not exactly The Gruffalo. Belloc was a moralising early 20th Century writer, politician and devout Catholic who warned about the threat posed by Islam.

‘Remember to hang on to nurse, for fear of finding something worse,’ says Truss, trotting out the best known line.

Doubtless it was a Maggie favourite too.

Eyeing my frown, Truss says: ‘My daughter loves bloodthirsty stories. My other daughter is obsessed with The Great British Bake Off and made croissants for breakfast.’

Truss’s friend and Cabinet ally Michael Gove is fond of saying she will be the Tories’ second female leader.

Truss bats it away.

‘I just want to get things done. David Cameron is going to be the Prime Minister for a long time.’

And after that?

‘I’m just enjoying doing what I’m doing, Simon,’ she says with a smile.
