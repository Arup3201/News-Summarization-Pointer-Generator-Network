A food tycoon's son who left a baby paralysed and brain damaged in a horror car crash is facing jail for a second time over a bar brawl that left a man blinded.

Antonio Boparan, 28, pleaded guilty to inflicting actual bodily harm and violent disorder after two men were punched, kicked and hit with broken bottles at Birmingham's Nuvo Bar.

He has already served 21 months in jail for causing horrific injuries to one-year-old Cerys Edwards in a crash while speeding at 72mph on the wrong side of a 30mph road in November 2006.

Now the charity founder from Sutton Coldfield and three other men are facing jail after the two men were attacked - leaving one with a fractured eye socket who has since lost the use of an eye.

Nathan Pringle, 32, from Erdington and Edward Ansah, 24, from Sutton Coldfield both admitted violent disorder at Birmingham Crown Court following the attack in April last year.

Theadore Mullings-Fairweather, 25, from Selly Oak, admitted inflicting grievous bodily harm and causing grievous bodily harm with intent and all four will now be sentenced in March.

Boparan is the son of Ranjit Singh Boparan, who owns Harry Ramsden's and has an estimated fortune of £800million along with his wife Baljinder.

He served 21 months in jail for causing horrific injuries to one-year-old Cerys Edwards in a crash which left her paralysed and brain damaged

He crashed his parents' Range Rover in 2006 while speeding at 72mph on the wrong side of a 30mph road

The family business - 2 Sisters Food Group – has a turnover of more than £3.4billion.

Boparan was 19 when he crashed his parents' Range Rover in Sutton Coldfield, leaving Cerys paralysed, brain damaged and needing round-the-clock care.

The impact of the crash was so severe that Cerys - now nine-years-old - was ripped from her baby seat and her spine was fractured.

She was left unable to talk and walk and still requires a ventilator just to keep her alive 

Her father Gareth, 50, said: 'He practically killed Cerys that night and now he has been caught up in an incident which left another person permanently disabled.

'Sadly, I can't say I'm surprised. Even when he was on bail for dangerous driving in Cerys's case, the court was told that he was caught speeding at 95mph on the Aston Expressway.

'He does not care what damage he inflicts on other people. These latest victims could have been left brain damaged or paralysed, just like Cerys.

'He ruined our lives, but has done nothing to help Cerys. His father handed over £200,000 towards her house and the insurers paid out for her ongoing care after a five-year battle, but he has never even had the guts to meet her and she is now nine-years-old.

Ranjit Singh Boparan owns 2 Sisters Food Group - a Birmingham-based food-manufacturing company.

Established in 1993 as a frozen retail cutting operation, it has grown rapidly and expanded to cover 36 manufacturing sites in the UK, eight in the Netherlands, five in Ireland and one in Poland.

The group employs 23,000 people, and has annual sales of £3.4billion. It is listed 14th on the 2014 Sunday Times Top Track 100.

The company is now the third largest food company in the UK by turnover.

Brands include Fox's Biscuits, Goodfella's, Donegal Catch and Green Isle.

Harry Ramsden's was told to Boparan Ventures Ltd in 2010, the private investment branch of his business empire.

If Cerys had been killed in the crash, Boparan would have faced up to 14 years in jail for causing death by dangerous driving.

The outrage over his short sentence sparked a nationwide campaign which resulted a change in the law to ensure anyone convicted of causing serious injury by dangerous driving faces up to five years in prison instead of the previous maximum of two.

Labour's former Justice Minister Jack Straw called the family himself to give them the news about what became known as 'Cerys's Law'.

Ranjit Singh's family business was built from 'a small-scale frozen retail cutting operation' and now controls about 20 per cent of the UK poultry market.

Mr Singh is the fifth richest person in the Midlands and fifth richest Asian in the UK as the director of some 50 companies and subsidiaries.

The father-of-five is also the chairman of Northern Foods, the company behind Goodfellas pizzas and Fox's Biscuits, which 2 Sisters acquired in 2011 for nearly £350million. 

Cerys was awarded £5million compensation in 2012 along with a guaranteed annual payout of £450,000 for the rest of her life. 

The long battle to secure compensation from the insurers took more than five years.

At the time Judge Martin McKenna, sitting at Birmingham County Court, described it as the 'saddest and most tragic case' he had come across.
