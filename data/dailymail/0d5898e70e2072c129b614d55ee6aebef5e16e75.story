With a detailed birth plan and her mother on hand to help out, actress Vivian Gray thought she had written the perfect script for the arrival of her second child.

But her baby son had other ideas.

Sky was so keen to make his debut that he had to be delivered on the pavement outside the hospital...in a street fittingly called Hollywood Road and with his grandmother’s Burberry coat hurriedly laid out for him on the ground.

Miss Gray, 31, began having 
contractions  in the early hours, a week before her due date. When her 
waters broke, she presumed she had plenty of time to walk to the local 
maternity unit.

She set off for Chelsea and Westminster Hospital with her husband Adrian Jayasinha, 38, an investment banker, and her mother Alicia Gray, a plastic surgeon, who was staying at their home. But just 30 yards from the hospital doors, Miss Gray could walk no further and realised her baby had decided he wasn’t waiting any longer.

Yesterday the Scottish-born actress, who is well-known in the US for playing villain Suzy Edwards in television drama Desire, said: ‘I started having mild contractions in the middle of the night. I was fairly confident I had some time, so I thought, “Relax, stay in bed a bit longer”.

‘After a couple of hours they started getting more frequent and a bit stronger, and I thought I’d time them on my iPhone to see if perhaps I was going into labour.

‘The problem was that I couldn’t quite focus on the timer. That’s when I realised the contractions were already very strong. So I woke up my husband, and unexpectedly my waters broke. I stood there stunned. Then I thought I should put some make-up on so I would look good in the pictures when the baby was born – I was clearly a bit delirious.’

Medical staff from the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital came out to assist Miss Gray, who was eventually taken into the building on a stretcher

Miss Gray left home just after 5am, thinking it would be quicker to walk than get a taxi as the hospital was so close. But the contractions quickly became more powerful.

‘It was as if my body was doing all the work and I had no power over this pushing sensation,’ she said.

‘Adrian was immobilised, he just froze. Thankfully, my mother was like Sir Walter Raleigh throwing his cloak over a puddle for the Queen, and took off her Burberry coat for me to crouch on, then ran to the hospital for help.

‘The porter must have thought she was some kind of crazy lady because she was a bit frantic.

Miss Gray and baby Sky were allowed out of hospital to go home 12 hours later to join her husband Adrian and older son Liam

‘But the hospital was extremely efficient. Within three minutes, two midwives, two assistant midwives and two paramedics were with me with all the equipment and held sheets round me to screen me from view while they delivered the baby.’

Sky was born a healthy 7lb 9oz at 5.51am on June 12, just half an hour after Miss Gray’s waters broke.

She had spent eight hours in labour with her first child Liam, now two, so Sky’s speedy delivery came as something of a shock.

After the birth, she spent 12 hours in hospital before taking her newborn son home the same day.
