A quick brown fox is bringing chaos to a golf course by darting out to steal player's golf balls from right under their noses before racing off to hide them in the bushes.

Golfers at the course in the alpine resort of Verbier, Switzerland, have been left watching in disbelief as the wily animal suddenly appears on the fairway moments after they tee off.

The fox is estimated to have chased and gathered over 100 balls so far, often while they are in play, and shows no sign of getting bored.

Murielle Guex, manager of the Moulins snack bar, across the road from the course, told France's 20 Minutes newspaper: 'He comes every day, steals the balls and plays with them.'

'He picks up the balls, then immediately runs away. He is fantastic and very courageous as he dares to come very close to people.'

The fox first appeared on September 6th and now comes everyday between four and six in the afternoon. He is believed to have three different spots where it is hiding its stolen booty.

Despite the interruptions to their games, most of the players see the funny side with the fox becoming a sort of unofficial club mascot.

Ms Guex added: 'They often laugh at it and the fox has become a sort of mascot.'

Club's director Thomas Grech, told CNN: 'People are very interested and many people come in the afternoon to see the animal

'It's not very common to see a savage animal coming so close to people who play on the golf course. It's very, very special for us.'
