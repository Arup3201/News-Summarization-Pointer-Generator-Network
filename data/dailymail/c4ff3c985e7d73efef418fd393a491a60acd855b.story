The average person in Britain spends £50,000 on alcohol on their lifetime, a survey has revealed. 

This equates to £787 each year, with Londoners spending nearly an extra £100.

However there is also a hardcore 1.3 million who spend almost triple the average, shelling out £167,000 on booze during their lifetime.

Happy times: The average person in Britain spends £50,000 on alcohol on their lifetime, with Londoners splurging the most cash on booze

The figures, compiled for Macmillan Cancer Support, show men splash more cash on booze, spending an average of £934.44 per year, compared to women who fork out £678.60.

When it comes to the drink of choice, around one in three people surveyed said wine was their top tipple, followed by beer and then spirits. 

However among 18-24 year-olds, spirits topped the list as the preferred tipple, whereas the over 45s preferred wine. 

The research, involving 2,000 people, was conducted to mark the launch of Macmillan's Go Sober for October fundraising event.

Macmillan is asking people to sign up for the Go Sober challenge, abstaining from drinking alcohol during October and being sponsored to do so. 

Commenting on the findings, Martin Lewis, from Moneysavingexpert.com, said: 'It's not just the price of buying booze that costs, it's the fact when we drink we lose our spending inhibitions too.

'We all know the cheap night out that turns into a pocket killer, so even going sober for a month could save you a significant amount. 

'Not only will you be saving cash, but helping people affected by cancer.

Research released by the charity earlier this month found the average British person spends almost a year of their lives nursing a hangover.

It is estimated we spend 315 days of our lives battling with headaches and nausea caused by drinking.

The poll also revealed a north-south divide with the frequency of hangovers, with 22 per cent of people from the north likely to have more than four hangovers each month compared to 15 per cent of people from the south.

Women's hangovers appear to last longer - with the average lasting nine hours - compared to a seven hour hangover suffered by men.

The study suggests that being hungover could jeopardise your chance of finding romance or getting your dream job.

One in every 13 of those surveyed said they had missed a first date because they were too hungover and one in ten said they had missed a job interview.

If you do have a special event during October and want to drink alcohol for it, your friends or family can buy you a 'Golden Ticket' by donating £15 or more to your fundraising page.

Shamefully, eight per cent of those surveyed admitted they had missed a wedding thanks to a hangover, and six per cent admitted they had missed a funeral.

Over half said the most annoying aspect of being hungover was that it made them feel sick while more than a quarter said wasting time was their biggest bugbear. 

Of those who complained about a hangover being a waste of time, a quarter said if they weren't hungover, they'd have more sex.

A hangover also prevented people from taking part in more edifying activities.

A further 16 per cent said they'd learn a language, 41 per cent said they'd exercise more and 13 per cent said they'd learn an instrument. 

Hannah Redmond, of Macmillan Cancer Support, said: 'By taking part in Go Sober for October, abstaining from drinking alcohol for the month of October and being sponsored to do so, you'll save money, reap the health benefits and raise vital funds to support people affected by cancer so they don't have to face it alone.'
