President Warren Harding famously campaigned on a platform of ‘a return to normalcy’ in the 1920s, but it’s his steamy love letters to a friends' wife that will finally be made available to the public later this month.

Over a decade prior to becoming the nation's 29th president, Harding enjoyed a torrid love affair with Carrie Phillips who he eulogized in over 1,000 pages of love letters.

The Harding family donated the letters - previously under court-ordered seal for 50 years - to the Library of Congress, which will finally make the letters available to the public online on July 29.

Loveless marriage: President Warren Harding is pictured in 1922 with his wife Florence, but it's his steamy love letters to a friends' wife that will finally be made available to the public later this month

In his 2009 book The Harding Affair: Love And Espionage During The Great War, author James Robenalt contends that Carrie Phillips, left, was the love of Harding's life

The 
letters were written between 1910 and 1920 during an affair that began 
in 1905 between then-Ohio Lt. Gov. Harding and family friend Phillips.

Despite Harding asking his mistress to destroy the letters, she kept every word.

‘I
 do not know what inspired you, but you... resurrected me, and set me 
aflame with the fullness of your beauty and the fire of your desire… 
imprisoned me in your embrace and gave me transport - God! My breath 
quickens to recall it,’ wrote Harding in Sept 1913 after the pair had 
spent a weekend in New York.

Two
 months later, he wrote his love for her was ‘the surpassing influence 
of my life. It is big, and glorious, and hallowed. It is full of 
blessings and radiant with dreams.

'It could be as ardent and wild and impassioned as you have ever known it.’

Some of the letters were released to the public a decade ago when author James Robenalt was researching the president and discovered forgotten microfilm copies.

In his 2009 book The Harding Affair: Love And Espionage During The Great War, Robenalt contends that Phillips may have been a German spy – or at very least a Nazi sympathizer.

Robenalt has read almost all of the letters and believes that both Harding and Phillips were in barely functioning marriages.

Florence Harding, who was divorced from her first, alcoholic husband, was chronically ill, Robenalt recounts.

'There isn’t one iota of affection in my home relationship,' wrote Harding. 'It is merely existence, necessary for appearance’s sake.'

'I believe, based on everything I’ve read of these 900 pages, that [Harding’s relationship with his wife] was sterile, and that Carrie was his sexual outlet,' Robenalt told the Washington Post.

Phillips chose to live for months in Europe with her daughter and away from her husband, Jim.

'This woman was clearly the love of his life,' said Robenalt.

'My Darling. There are no words, at my command, sufficient to say the full extent of my love for you - a mad, tender, devoted, ardent, eager, passion-wild, jealous... hungry... love,' he wrote on Christmas Eve 1910.

'It flames like the fire and consumes. It racks in the tortures of aching hunger, and glows in bliss ineffable - bliss only you can give.'

As Harding climbed the political ladder toward presidency, it became more troublesome for the two to stay together.

Although the affair ended prior to Harding’s presidential inauguration in 1921, Harding and Phillips remained on good terms.

In 1922, Phillips, accompanied by her husband and mother, visited President Harding at the White House.

When her health failed in 1956, Phillips was admitted to a nursing home in Marion and died in 1960.

Her lawyer and guardian found and retained the letters, which were hidden in a box in Phillips’ home in Marion, Ohio.

The lawyer made the collection available to a potential Harding biographer in 1963, although the use of quotes from the letters in this biography was thwarted by a lawsuit brought by the president’s nephew, Dr. George Harding.

An Ohio probate judge closed the papers on July 29, 1964, and after extended litigation, the Harding-Phillips letters were purchased by Dr. Harding from Phillips’ daughter, Isabelle Phillips Mathée.

In 1972, Dr. Harding donated the letters to the Library of Congress for safekeeping, with the stipulation that the Library keep the papers closed until July 29, 2014, which would be 50 years from the day the probate judge first closed them.

The letters have been locked in a vault in the Library’s Manuscript Division since their donation. Taken as a whole, the correspondence sheds light on a man on the eve of his presidency and a country on the brink of World War I.

The library is hosting a program to discuss the collection July 22, featuring library and outside experts and a Harding descendant.

Harding is rumored to have had other affairs, including with Nan Britton, who claimed that she carried on with Harding when he was president - once allegedly in a White House coat closet - and had his child.

'I don’t think he was a rampant womanizer,' said Robenalt. 'I think he fell in love with women [Phillips].'
