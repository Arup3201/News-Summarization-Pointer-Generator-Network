The results from the latest round of Premier League football have left an intriguing tussle for the final two Champions League places as five teams concertina together.

Just four points separate Arsenal in third from Tottenham Hotspur in seventh, with Manchester United, Southampton, and Liverpool in between.

Chelsea and Manchester City are removed at the top, battling for the title, leaving that quintet jostling to make the cut into Europe’s elite club competition.

Here, Sportsmail looks at 10 key fixtures that could decide who will be mixing it with the continent’s best next season.

MANCHESTER UNITED vs TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR, March 15

A struggle for life, is how Louis Van Gaal termed the second half of the sides’ 0-0 draw at White Hart Lane on December 28. Hopefully this match provides a little more entertainment. Spurs have come away from Old Trafford victorious on the past two occasions. Now is perhaps the time for the Dutch manager to show Spurs what they missed out on.

SWANSEA vs LIVERPOOL, March 16

Brendan Rodgers heading back once more to the club where he made his name, taking on the manager he made captain during his tenure. What price Garry Monk derailing his former mentor? Liverpool have not won at the Liberty Stadium in three attempts – two draws and one defeat. Swansea have already beaten Arsenal and Manchester United there this season.

LIVERPOOL vs MANCHESTER UNITED, March 22

The reverse fixture marked the turning point in Liverpool’s campaign, as well as one of the few high points for Van Gaal. A 3-0 scoreline illustrated David De Gea’s form more than United’s superiority as Rodgers found some success trialling three at the back. Liverpool have not lost over 90 minutes in 18 games since. They will want revenge.

ARSENAL vs LIVERPOOL, April 4

An enduring duel in recent years, the match at Anfield back in December added another chapter. The 2-2 draw saw Fabio Borini sent off in the second minute of stoppage time, before Martin Skrtel found a dramatic equaliser four minutes and 20 seconds later. Any result at the Emirates is conceivable, with a draw and a win for each side in the last three meetings.

STOKE vs SOUTHAMPTON, April 18

Ronald Koeman was in the Barcelona team that lost to Manchester United in the 1991 Cup Winners' Cup final when Mark Hughes scored a brace. The two tangle again at the Britannia, with Europe on the agenda again. They enjoyed a topsy-turvey Capital One Cup encounter there in October, Asmir Begovic scored from his own half inside 13 seconds last season, while a 3-3 draw was shared the campaign before that. Could be interesting.

SOUTHAMPTON vs TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR, April 25

Mauricio Pochettino returns to St Mary’s for the first time since leaving last summer and is probably in for a frosty reception, if the response from home fans to Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana is anything to go by. Koeman has shown losing the Argentine was not as cataclysmic as first appeared and would love to inflict a costly defeat to prove the point.

ARSENAL vs CHELSEA, April 26

Just imagine Arsene Wenger’s post-match words were Arsenal to cement their Champions League ambitions and dent Jose Mourinho’s title aspirations. The man labelled a ‘specialist in failure’ and ‘voyeur’ by Mourinho could be forgiven for sneaking a glance at this game already. Twelve times Wenger has failed to beat the Portuguese – five draws, seven defeats – so 13th time lucky?

TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR vs MANCHESTER CITY, May 2

Spurs are in the midst of an unfortunate run against City – three successive defeats with a cumulative 15 goals conceded and two scored. But Pochettino’s side did at least trouble the reigning champions at the Etihad and now have Harry Kane in full swing. Will Manuel Pellegrini be the next victim of the 'Hurrikane'?

MANCHESTER UNITED vs ARSENAL, May 16

The old rivalry should be refuelled in the penultimate round of fixtures, in a match that could have a significant influence on finishing positions. United won at the Emirates earlier this season in a smash and grab of criminal proportions. That was when Angel Di Maria and Wayne Rooney looked an exciting duo. They will need to reprise that understanding against Wenger's side.

MANCHESTER CITY vs SOUTHAMPTON, May 24

The Etihad has seen final day action for the past three seasons with various outcomes. Drama of an unimaginable kind culminated the 2011-12 season, Norwich inflicted shock defeat in 2012-13, while West Ham were vanquished to secure the title last season. This fixture promises intrigue, with City hoping to still be pushing Chelsea and Southampton aiming for a climactic flourish into Europe.
