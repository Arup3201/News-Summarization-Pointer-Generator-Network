Imagine rolling out of bed into your train without even stepping outdoors. Now imagine that bed was in a uber luxurious bedroom suspended  in the rafters of a breathtaking penthouse, and with views over most of London. Sounds like a well-heeled city commuter's dream.

That's the reality for businessman Arran Patel, the owner of this breathtaking apartment, built in the attic of the famous London landmark of St Pancras.

With a ceiling more than 40ft high and three stepped levels connected by a staircase with glass balustrades, the property has lashings of wow factor.

With the help of interior architect TG Studio, Patel, who lives between New York, London and South Africa, spent £300 per square foot on renovating the property - one of three penthouses in the 67 unit development.

The master bedroom, which is located on the top floor, is open plan and can be closed to the triple-height living room by an electrically operated curtain. Patel describes the room as 'a self-contained hotel suite'.

The master ensuite has a cave-like feel and is built using Portuguese Travertine stone. The bathroom also features an extra-large walk-in shower with a flush TV and a bespoke double sink unit.

The staircase also leads to a bridge that connects to a library, which is cantilevering the main part of the staircase.

The 800sqft upper floor  accommodates a very comfortable seating area and a pool tab zone, while the open plan lower floor has a relaxed kitchen, dining space and TV watching area. 

Also on the entrance floor are two bedrooms with a dressing area and en suite each and a guest WC and storage.

The two en suite bathrooms are located in two gothic towers of the building which gives them great views of the surrounding area and a triple ceiling height. 

Finished in Arabescato marble, each features a low hanging chandelier to play with the unusual ceiling height.

Says Patel of the project: 'I wanted to capture the grandeur of the building from its initial opening in 1873, but in a modern day context,'The views are also somewhat spectacular. 

'There are views of almost every major landmark in the capital; from Canary Wharf in the East to the London Eye on the South Bank and the BT Tower in the West,' he says.

Thomas Griem of TG Studios explains: 'The penthouse is located in one of the most important historic buildings in London.

'It is located in the “attic” volume of this gothic building and features the original timber trusses and beams. 

'These beams are the feature of this penthouse refurbishment and a huge influence to my design. 

'I have tried to soften these rustic elements and have introduced sophisticated materials throughout and sleek furniture and combined this sophistication with minimal design elements such as cantilevered glass balustrades and the modern style kitchen.'
