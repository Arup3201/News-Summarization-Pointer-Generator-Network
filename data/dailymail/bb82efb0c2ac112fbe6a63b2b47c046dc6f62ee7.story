Hanna Strong was caught on camera using hateful speech

A Syracuse University soccer player has been suspended from the team after she was caught on camera hurling racist and homophobic slurs.

Midfielder Hanna Strong, a senior at the university, is now the subject of a discrimination investigation after being identified as the student in the video, The Daily Orange reported Saturday.

'If you touch me, it will be over,' Strong tells a black male while he walks away, his hands up, in the undated video.

'Are you recording this? You f****t-ass n****r,' she shouts to another person off-camera. 'It’s bulls**t.'

The hateful words drew an audible reaction from a crowd off-camera— and Strong responded.

'Call me out on saying the n-word? I don’t give a s**t,' she adds.

'Don’t record me saying this!'

Women's soccer coach Phil Wheddon has suspended Strong from the team indefinitely, pending results of the investigation.

'We
 are aware of the offensive comments made last night by a member of the 
women's soccer team,' said Daryl Gross, the university's athletic 
director, in a statement.

'This
 type of intolerant and hurtful language, focused on both race and 
sexual orientation, is not part of the culture we seek to foster among 
our student-athletes and it has no place at Syracuse University.'

SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO

Strong,
 of Monson, Massachusetts, has played in five games so far this season 
after missing last year due to an injury, according to The Daily Orange.

She was on the Athletic Director's honor roll for the past two semesters, the student newspaper reported.

'Syracuse
 Athletics, as a strong and diverse part of this University community, 
has zero tolerance for these actions,' Gross said.
