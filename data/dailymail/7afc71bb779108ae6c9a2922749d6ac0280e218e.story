ITV's new breakfast show Good Morning Britain fronted by Susanna Reid could face the chop after just one month on air following a ratings slump.

Since it launched to a grand fanfare at the end of April, ratings have plummeted as viewers continue to tune in to Reid's former show BBC Breakfast.

For the past fortnight the programme has failed to reach the 15 per cent of the audience share bosses reportedly said it needed to survive, and the show is being watched by fewer people than flop Daybreak - which it was brought in to replace.

Facing the chop? Susanna Reid's ITV breakfast show Good Morning Britain, which she presents along with Sean Fletcher, Ben Shephard and Charlotte Hawkins, could be axed following a ratings slump

Falling ratings: Although around 80,000 people tuned in for the launch show, numbers have slipped since

Reid was Good Morning Britain's big signing to launch the new show after being lured from the BBC, where she had proved to be a popular figure.

During Good Morning Britain's launch 
week, the ITV show had an average of about 690,000 viewers, while BBC 
Breakfast maintained a steady 1.5million.

However, last Monday just 270,000 viewers watched the show, according to The Sun, and despite it being a Bank Holiday, 1.17 million people still tuned into the BBC rival - which had a 34.7 percent of the audience share, compared with Good Morning Britain's 9.5 percent.

A senior source at ITV admitted that the programme would be unable to continue, unless viewers returned. 

Replacement: Good Morning Britain's high profile launch came after its predecessor Daybreak, presented in its final months by Lorraine Kelly and Aled Jones, was dropped for low audience figures

Rival: Susanna Reid left BBC Breakfast, here presented by Charlie Stayt and Louise Minchin, earlier this year. The BBC show regularly pulls in average viewing figures of more than one million

'No-one is expecting to beat the BBC and no-one is expecting to get over a million viewers,' the source told The Sun's Colin Robertson.

'But we do want it to get above 15 percent - or it is toast.'

Good Morning Britain's high profile launch came after its predecessor Daybreak was dropped for low audience figures.

Between its debut to May 28 Good Morning Britain attracted an average audience of 584,200, 15.2 percent of the audience share, compared with Daybreak's average of 673,800, or 16.6 percent, during the same period last year.

In the months before it was axed Daybreak was attracting an average of around 600,000 viewers.

The source suggested that Good Morning Britain, introduced by ITV's director of television Peter Fincham, could continue for the next six months to avoid embarrassment for bosses at the channel.

However, following Daybreak the broadcaster could be tempted to do away with a breakfast show completely, and return to showing children's programmes every morning.

An ITV spokesman told MailOnline that there are 'absolutely no plans to axe Good Morning Britain', and programme makers are in for 'the long game'.

Reid, whose profile increased hugely late last year in the wake of her appearances on last year’s Strictly Come Dancing, is joined on the weekday show by Ben Shephard - a familiar face for ITV breakfast viewers from his GMTV days, as well as Charlotte Hawkins and Sean Fletcher - who were both poached from Sky.

The four presenters appear on screen at the same time.

For viewers, one of the biggest changes to predecessor Daybreak - along with the presenting team - was the introduction of a glass desk at which the hosts were seated for much of the show, although they moved to sofas later.

Many observers have interpreted the discussions around the desk as more of a US-style approach, taking its cue from ABC’s popular Good Morning America.

But viewers were divided on the show, with some lamenting the passing of its predecessor while others praised its fast pace and gloss.

Ms Reid’s ITV debut initially drew mixed reactions, with criticism that the show looked too similar to its U.S counterpart and that Ms Reid’s figure were obscured by a desk.

As the show began viewers took to Twitter to complain that the legs of the 43-year-old - whose pay for the role has been reported as £400,000 and as much as £1million a year - were hidden from view.

One viewer commented: 'Why has ITV paid so much for @susannareid100 only to put her behind a desk? Its like buying a Ferrari and keeping it in the garage #gmb.'

Another wrote: 'You don't hire Susanna Reid and then stick her behind a desk #getyourpinsout #GoodMorningBritain.'
