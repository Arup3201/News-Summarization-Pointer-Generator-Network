The head of the Senate Intelligence Committee has accused the CIA of spying on their internal computer network during their searches about how the agency used torture during Bush-era terror investigations.

The shocking allegations were made by Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, who publicly aired her grievances on the Senate floor on Tuesday.

CIA director John Brennan has since denied the claims during an interview later that day, but he didn’t shy away from complaining about Senator Feinstein’s behavior.

Airing her grievances: Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Senator Dianne Feinstein accused the CIA of improperly searching a network of computers designed for Congress

Brennan said the agency was not trying to stop the committee's report and that it had not hacked into Senate computers.

He
 said the appropriate authorities would look at the matter further and 
‘I defer to them to determine whether or not there was any violation of 
law or principle.’

Feinstein
 said the matter has been referred to the Justice Department for further
 investigation. She said she had ‘grave concerns that the CIA's search 
may well have violated the separation of powers principles embodied in 
the U.S. Constitution.’

The 
CIA provided computers to congressional staffers in a secure room in 
northern Virginia in 2009 so the panel could review millions of pages of
 top secret documents in the course of its investigation into the CIA's 
detentions and interrogations during the Bush administration.

At
 issue now is whether the CIA violated an agreement made with the Senate
 Intelligence Committee about monitoring the panel's use of CIA 
computers.

When asked about the ongoing battle of he-said, she-said, the White House sided with the CIA but did not expand into details.

'White House’s perspective on this is reflected in the fact that we  support the declassification of the findings of the report,' Jay Carney said at a Tuesday afternoon press conference.

Feinstein said 
the Senate staff members had an electronic search tool to deal with 6.2 
million pages of documents and the ability to make copies on their 
computers. She said the arrangement suffered a blow when CIA personnel 
electronically removed the committee's access to documents that had 
already been provided to the panel.

Denial: CIA Director John Brennan said that the agency 'was in no way spying' on the Congressional committee in question or the Senate

She
 said about 870 documents were removed in February 2010, and an 
additional 50 were withdrawn without the knowledge of the committee.

Feinstein said she has asked the agency for an apology but the CIA has been silent.

Director
 Brennan, who first told Feinstein about the surveillance of the Senate 
investigation that occurred before he took over the CIA, had no 
immediate comment on the senator's statement.

The
 dispute comes as the Obama administration is trying to regain public 
trust after classified details about widespread surveillance of 
Americans were disclosed by former National Security Agency systems 
analyst Edward Snowden last summer.

This
 dispute does not involve the NSA spying on Americans, but it does show a
 fractious relationship between the U.S. spy agencies and the Congress 
charged with overseeing them.

Feinstein,
 as head of the Intelligence panel, has defended the NSA against 
criticism of its practices, making her comments about the CIA dispute 
highly unusual. Senators said the stakes demanded it.

Public stage: Senator Feinstein spoke about the alleged searches of the materials on the use of torture during the Bush administration on the Senate floor Tuesday after having two prior private requests ignored

‘If
 we do not stand up for the protection of the separation of powers and 
our ability to do oversight, especially when conduct has happened that 
is all likelihood criminal conduct on the part of a government agency, 
then what do we stand for?’ asked Vermont’s Democratic Senator Patrick 
Leahy, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee.

Saying
 she wanted to set the record straight amid various published reports 
and rampant speculation, Feinstein said the CIA searched the computer 
network in January and she had pressed Brennan about the agency's 
actions and the legal basis for its search.

She said she had not received any answers despite letters sent on January 17 and January 23.

Feinstein
 said the CIA's inspector general, David Buckley, has referred the 
matter to the Justice Department ‘given the possibility of a criminal 
violation by CIA personnel.’

In
 further evidence of the escalating fight, Feinstein said that after the
 inspector general's referral, the acting counsel of the CIA filed a 
criminal report with the Justice Department regarding the committee 
staff's actions.

Feinstein defended the staff as professionals with appropriate security clearances.

Supporting the Senator: Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Senator Patrick Leahy agreed with Feinstein, who claimed the CIA's searches undermined the separation of powers under the Constitution

‘I
 view the acting counsel general's referral as a potential effort to 
intimidate this staff, and I am not taking it lightly,’ she said.

Brennan,
 who was questioned at an appearance on another subject, said ‘We are 
not in any way, shape or form trying to thwart this report.’

‘I am confident that the authorities will deal with this appropriately,’ he said.

‘I
 would just encourage some members of the Senate to take their time, to 
make sure they don't overstate what they claim and what they apparently 
believe to be the truth.’

Democrats
 on the Senate Intelligence Committee completed their 6,300-page 
interrogation report last year and are revising it with CIA comments. 
Feinstein said she would ask the White House to declassify its 
300-plus-page executive summary, and its conclusions.

When
 the report was first approved by Democrats on the committee in December
 2012, Feinstein said her staffers came to the conclusion that the 
detention and interrogation program yielded little or no significant 
intelligence.
