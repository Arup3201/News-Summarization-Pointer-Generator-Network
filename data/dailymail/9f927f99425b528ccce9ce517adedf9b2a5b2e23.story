An artist makes incredible delicate and detailed pieces of art just by walking over fresh snowfall.

55-year-old Simon Beck walks miles in the snow to make these incredible pieces that only last a day before being covered by a fresh snowfall.

The artist from Bracknell, Berkshire walks over layers of fresh snow with nothing but an expedition compass and a pair of snowshoes to create his slope styling art.

The orienteering map designer, finds spaces in between lodges and mountains at ski resorts to create these masterpieces.

Glacial beauty: Simon Beck walks miles in the snow to make these incredible artworks that only last until they are covered by a fresh snowfall

Intricate: The artist can walk up to 40km over 10 hours to indulge in his passion for snow art

He creates large, mathematical patterns that have varying effects when viewed from different angles and as the day progresses, his creations take on new aspects.

He typically makes his mind-blowing designs in France, where he lives during ski season, and documents them afterward with awe-inspiring photographs.

Mr Beck said: 'Most of the time I travel round the Alps and hike up mountains, aiming to be on the summit at sunset for good photos. My feet are in a bad way but if I can keep my weight off the front of my feet things are not too bad.

'Often I am copying designs I have found, like crop circles or well-known mathematical figures, or repeating designs I have made earlier but failed to get good photos of.

'Some designs I am commissioned to do require a lot of study as to the best way to create it, and this process can take several hours.'

Vortex: The artist creates large, mathematical patterns that have varying effects when viewed from different angles and at different times of the day

Snow shell: He  first plans out the pattern on graph paper, then surveys the site and judges where the major points of the design should be, and starts at one of those points

The artist favours level, untracked site with a uniform snow depth of about nine inches of powdery snow

Pole star: To spread the word, the artist has written his Facebook page in the snow above the design

Mr Beck first plans out the pattern on graph paper, then surveys the site and judges where the major points of the design should be, and starts at one of those points.

From the centre he calculates the distance to the other points and walks out and back from the centre to the other points, using either pace counting or a measuring tape to determine the number of steps he needs to take.

Each piece is composed of a series of lines, geometric shapes, or arcs and curves, which he shades in to fill in the pattern.

It takes him about 10 hours on average to complete a piece and he estimates that he's walked more than 40km to complete some pieces, which only last until the next heavy snowfall.

The artist favours level, untracked site with a uniform snow depth of about nine inches of powdery snow to make sure his art looks best in photographs, which he takes from either an aircraft, summit or a ski lift.

Epic: The artworks are created during the ski season, when Mr Beck relocates to France
