Officials say a school bus carrying a driver and 45 students from a North Carolina middle school has overturned, injuring 15 of the children.

Gaston County Schools spokesman Todd Hagans said the N.C. Highway Patrol determined that a compartment door above the driver fell open, creating a distraction before the accident Wednesday afternoon.

Hagans says 11 students were taken to a Gastonia hospital and four more to a hospital in nearby Kings Mountain. None of the injuries appeared to be serious. He says the driver wasn't hurt.

Authorities render aid to school children after a bus carrying about 40 students overturned in North Carolina Wednesday afternoon

The bus flipped after the driver got 'distracted' and 'over-corrected' when she went off the road

TV footage showed the yellow bus on its side, blocking a two-lane road with its two rooftop hatches and the  rear door open. Emergency officials clustered nearby.

The patrol said speed was not a factor in the accident.

'The door of a compartment above the bus driver opened and distracted the driver,' officials told WBTV.

'When she tried to clear her line of sight the bus went off the right side of the road and she over-corrected, causing the bus to overturn. Investigators say speed does not appear to have been a factor.'

There is no word yet as to whether or not charges will be pressed.

There was another crash in the state earlier in the day in Charlotte, though all 11 students and the driver were not injured.
