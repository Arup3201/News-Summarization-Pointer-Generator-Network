Recently honored: Legendary WWE wrestler The Ultimate Warrior collapsed and died Tuesday just days after he was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame as part of the most recent Wrestlemania Week

The wrestler was walking to his car with his wife just before 6pm when he fell to the ground, TMZ  reported.

He was taken to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead.

Hellwig,
 who started in the ring in 1987 and counted Hulk Hogan among his many 
victories, legally changed his name to Warrior in 1993 to match the name
 of his neon-faced, wild-haired alter-ego.

He
 became a household name after besting the Hulk in 1990's Wrestlemania VI, the 
highlight of a 13-year career in professional wrestling that included 
three stints in what was then known as the WWF.

Despite
 a long feud with WWE management, which included several lawsuits, 
Warrior was inducted into the organisation's Hall of Fame on Saturday.

On
 Monday, less than 24 hours before his collapse, he appeared in the ring
 at WWE Raw in New Orleans, where he gave a poignant speech that 
appeared to foreshadow his own death.

After
 pulling on a mask that looked like the facepaint he wore at the height 
of his career and switching into the voice of his wrestling alter-ego, 
he said: 'No WWE talent becomes a legend on their own.

'Every
 manâ€™s heart one day beats its final beat. His lungs breathe their final
 breath. And if what that man did in his life what makes the blood pulse
 through the body of others and makes them bleed deeper and something 
larger than life then his essence, his spirit, will be immortalized. By 
the story tellers, by the loyalty, by the memory of those who honor him 
and make the running the man did live forever.

'You,
 you, you, you, you, you are the legend makers of Ultimate Warrior. In 
the back I see many potential legends. Some of them with warrior 
spirits. And you will do the same for them. You will decide if they 
lived with the passion and intensity. So much so that you will tell your
 stories and you will make them legends, as well. I am The Ultimate 
Warrior. You are the Ultimate Warrior fans and the spirit of Ultimate 
Warrior will run forever.'

News of Warrior's death was met with an outpouring of grief on Twitter.

'Saddened
 to announce the passing of the Ultimate Warrior. Icon and friend. My 
sympathy to his wife Dana and his daughters,' wrote WWE COO Triple H.

Dwayne
 Johnson, aka The Rock, posted: 'Loss always has a way of reminding us 
to live and love as greatly as we can. My prayers and strength to his 
family.

'RIP Ultimate Warrior.'

Hulk Hogan said simply: 'RIP WARRIOR. Only love.'

WWE.com
 released a statement, it read: 'WWE is shocked and deeply saddened to 
learn of the passing of one of the most iconic WWE Superstars ever, The 
Ultimate Warrior.

'Warrior 
began his WWE career in 1987 and quickly went on to become one of the 
biggest stars in WWE history. Warrior became WWE Champion at 
WrestleMania VI, defeating Hulk Hogan in an epic encounter.

'We
 are grateful that just days ago, Warrior had the opportunity to take 
his rightful place in the WWE Hall of Fame and was also able to appear 
at WrestleMania 30 and Monday Night Raw to address his legions of fans.

'WWE
 sends its sincere condolences to Warriorâ€™s family, friends and fans. 
Warrior was 54 and is survived by his wife Dana and his two daughters.'
