A 'landlord from hell' who is serving a four-year prison sentence after terrorizing tenants who refused to move out has defended his actions in a jailhouse interview.

For more than three years Kip Macy and his wife Nicole stalked their tenants in the San Francisco apartment block, threatened them with a semi-automatic
 weapon, shut off power, changed the locks without telling them, and tried to have the 
windows boarded up while one tenant was still at home.

The
 couple even tried to saw through a supporting beam in one of the Market
 district flats to make it unfit to live in, but were stopped when the tenant, who was in, managed 
to bend the blade.

In June, the couple were convicted of burglary, stalking and attempted grand theft - but Macy has now stood by his actions, saying he was pushed to terrorize his tenants after the law failed to help.

The campaign of terror began soon after 
the couple bought an apartment block for $995,000 in 2005 and tried to 
evict the five tenants already living in it.

'There wasn't actually any legal way of 
doing it right, since we had done everything right legally, and it 
hadn't worked,' Macy, 39, told ABC's 20/20. 'That's when we started making bad 
decisions.'

He said that one tenant, Scott Morrow, was particularly problematic as he refused to leave.

'We harassed him a bit because [we] 
no longer had anything to lose,' Macy said. 'He had parts of his floor cut out from underneath, also illegal - but whatever.'

Cruel: Among the terror they inflicted, they cut a hole in the floor of one tenant's apartment

Destruction: They also tried to saw through a supporting beam so it would be deemed unfit to live in

Violent: When they tried to saw a hole in one tenant's apartment, he was in and bent the blade

The couple were also found guilty of burglary after moving belongings from the tenants' apartments, including property of his building manager, Ricardo Cartagena.

'I regret, you know, having moved the 
Mexicans' stuff into the hallway,' Macy told ABC, but added: 'I don't see how that 
was burglary, or theft, since I neither stole their stuff.'

But Macy blamed his wife for the idea, saying she wanted to buy the apartment block before forcing out the tenants so they could sell the individual apartments for a profit.

Within a year, the Macys were involved in litigation with Morrow, one of the tenants.

Mrs
 Macy set up a fake email account in Mr Morrow's name and sent a 
message to his lawyer saying his services were no longer needed. She then sent an email threatening to dismember the lawyer's children, in an effort to make Mr Morrow look unstable.

Exasperated: Building manager, Ricardo Cartagena, had belongings taken from his apartment and said the landlords had threatened to kill him with a gun. The terror continued for three years

The couple also changed the locks on the
 apartment leased to Erik Hernandez and Jason Lopez. The Macys then went into the apartment, dismantled furniture and stole $2,000, a Gucci watch and a phone, court documents said.

Mrs Macy also broke into the apartment and poured ammonia on the tenants' clothes and furniture.

The couple 
also threatened the building manager with a semi-automatic weapon and 
ordered the windows to one of the apartments to be boarded up while the 
tenant was still inside.

When the Macys were arrested in 2008 
they posted bail and left the country. They were tracked down in Italy 
last year and brought back to the U.S. where bail was set at $2 million 
each.

As they were sentenced, San Francisco District Attorney George Gasc√≥n said: 'The actions of these defendants are so 
outlandish and brazen that it sounds like the plot line of a horror 
movie.'
