Champagne lifestyle: John Atterberry, 40, died after being shot in the face while driving to the bank on Sunset Boulevard last week

A music executive has died after he was randomly shot by a crazed gunman while running a quick errand to the bank.

John Atterberry, 40, passed away on Monday at Cedars-Sinai 
Medical Center in Los Angeles, three days after he was gunned down on Sunset Boulevard.

Mr Atterberry, who had worked with the Spice Girls and Jessica Simpson, was shot in the jaw and torso by gunman Tyler Brehm.

The 40-year-old, who worked as a film producer, was driving his Mercedes-Benz when he was seriously injured. 

The
businessman had risen to vice-president at Death Row Records which 
produced artists such as Dr Dre, Snoop Dogg and Tupac Shakur.

He later founded Infusion Music Group, a
music publishing company with credits on albums by Michael Jackson, 
Christina Aguilera, Brandy, the Spice Girls and Jessica Simpson.

Mr Atterberry's Facebook page was flooded with tributes from friends and colleagues.

Shaunie
O'Neal, wife of former basketball player Shaquille O'Neal, wrote on 
Twitter: 'RIP John keepin the Atterberry family n my prayers.'

All My Children actress Liz Vassey added: 'RIP John Atterberry. Shot by the gunman on Sunset and Vine on Friday of last week. God bless his family. 40 years old. Tragic.'

Celebrity blogger Perez Hilton said: 'R.I.P. #JohnAtterberry Sending love and strength to his family and friends!' I really think America needs tighter gun control laws! You don't see as much gun violence in Canada!!!!'

Frost/Nixon actress Jenn Gotzon also tweeted: 'RIP #JohnAtterberry (my writer-producer for @GodsCountryfilm) He died today after being shot in the face. pls pray.'

Mr Atterberry was the only seriously 
injured victim of 26-year-old Brehm, who police say fired nearly 
20 bullets in the air and at cars as he screamed that he wanted to die. 
He was killed by police minutes later.

Brehm's ex-girlfriend said the couple had recently broken up but police said they're still looking 
for a motive for the attack.

Brehm walked down the middle of 
Sunset Boulevard, firing on motorists with no clear target and injuring 
three of them before two police officers who happened to be in the 
area - an off-duty motorcycle officer working movie set security and a 
detective - shot and killed him, according to authorities.

The gunman's former girlfriend has described how she woke to 14 text messages informing her of his death.

Alicia Alligood, 24, had broken up with her boyfriend of four-and-a-half years just days before he went on the shooting spree.

She
was unaware of his involvement in the shooting until she woke at 7 am 
the following day to 14 text messages - some from the shooter himself.

Brehm,
who neighbours said struggled to get over the December 1 breakup, sent 
messages minutes before he stood on the Hollywood intersection and shot 
at passing vehicles.

He had also left Alligood a voicemail hours earlier, telling her he loved her.

But Alligood described her former boyfriend 
as a 'humanitarian', and someone who was 'extremely motivated to change 
the world for the better', even managing a non-profit organisation for a
friend.

He had met a woman he thought was a 
pharmaceutical saleswoman who had given him some kind of pills, Alligood
said.

He began taking the pills, which Alligood found alarming as he had never taken 'hard' drugs before.

After the breakup, he had moved to his own apartment half a mile from the scene of the shooting, she said

Happier times: Tyler Brehm and ex-girlfriend Alicia Alligood are believed to have broken up four days before he went on a shooting rampage through Hollywood. The couple had been together for more than four years .

Neighbours said Brehm had been 
struggling to overcome the separation.

‘He wasn't a bad guy, he just got fed up,’ friend Christina Mesropian told KNBC. ‘He was like “Ah, I'm over it, I'm over it,” but I could tell he wasn't over it.’

Ramon Hernandez, who lived in the 
apartment next door to Brehm, said the couple had recently moved out. He
told KABC-TV he had heard them arguing.

‘I could tell that he was an unstable person,’ Hernandez said, ‘but I don't know the details on what actually made him snap.’

Police have not yet announced a motive for the crime, but Alligood said she believed the breakup was the trigger.

Brehm, who was Hispanic and dressed in
a white vest, walked down the middle of Sunset Boulevard on Friday, firing 
on motorists and in the air until he was shot and killed.

Passers-by initially thought he was an actor from a movie being filmed nearby.

Brehm
killed Mr Atterberry and wounded two others before he was killed by an 
off-duty officer working as a security guard on the neighbouring film, 
believed to be Sean Penn and Ryan Gosling's crime drama, Gangster Squad.

It is unknown if the actors were on set during the real-life shooting, but they would have heard the gunfire.

He was filmed from an office block as he stood in the middle of the road firing on pedestrians and motorists.

In the video, he can be seen pacing 
back and forth near the busy intersection with Vine Street, firing close
to 20 rounds from what appeared to be a .40 caliber handgun.

Witness Micah Williams said he 
thought the suspect was part of a movie. ‘Then the third bullet 
ricocheted right by our head and I was like, “Dude, they’re shooting at 
us,” ’ he said.

Another bystander, Gregory Bojorquez, 
said: ‘At first it seemed like a movie but then I heard the sound of the
bullets hitting metal. It was bizarre, like something from a cop show. 
You get so used to seeing filming in LA that lots of people were 
watching it thinking it was for a film.’

It is thought the gunman ran out of bullets and had pulled a knife from his belt when he was shot by the policeman.

‘He was screaming he was going to die and that he wanted to die,’ Bojorquez, a photographer who captured images of the shooting's aftermath, told the Los Angeles Times.

'He was just kind of shooting spontaneously,' witness William Wiles told The Baltimore Sun Times, recalling what he saw as he watched incident from his bedroom window.

'He didn't really have any mission or purpose or anyone in particular,' Mr Wiles continued.

One
man suffered a grazing wound to his left thigh when a bullet passed 
through his car door. Another man had minor cuts from broken glass after
bullet struck the driver door where it met the window.

Another witness, Chris Johns, said: 
'This was like a serious mad man. He snapped and he's going to try to 
kill as many people as possible.'

He continued shooting at vehicles and in the air when he was confronted by the officers.

They
ordered the suspect to drop his weapon. He was shot when he pointed his
weapon at the officers. The gunman was pronounced dead at the scene.

A truck and another car were struck by bullets, and two people were treated at the scene for minor injuries.

In
the Los Angeles area, every movie production is required to have a 
permit, so if there is shooting,  for a movie, locals are notified for 
any loud noises and big signs are placed on street corners.

The
area was cordoned off and the gunman lay under a white sheet in the 
street hours after the gunfire, leaving traffic tangled on busy 
Hollywood streets, an area is packed with stores and restaurants.
