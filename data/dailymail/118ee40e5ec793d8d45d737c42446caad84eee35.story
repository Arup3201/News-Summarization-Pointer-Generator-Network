Captain Walter Barrie was shot dead by a rogue member of the Afghan army as he played football on Remembrance Day

A British soldier was shot dead at close range by a rogue member of the Afghan army while playing a football match on Remembrance Day, an inquest has heard.

Captain Walter Barrie was playing alongside members from the Afghan National Army (ANA) at his base when he was killed in the Nad-e Ali district of Helmand province.

The gunman, named as Mohammad Ashraf, was dressed in full ANA uniform when he approached the pitch and fired nine shots towards Capt Barrie using an M16 rifle.

As the other soldiers fled, the gunman moved towards a welfare tent for British troops and continued firing, the hearing at Oxford Coroner’s Court was told.

The attack on November 11 last year was stopped when the Afghan soldier, described as being in his late teens or early 20s and of slim build with a beard, was shot dead by Isaf (International Security Assistance Force) soldiers, the inquest heard.

Intelligence officers had warned 
British troops of insider attacks after a similar incident in western 
Afghanistan on November 10.

Sixty per cent of insider attacks are followed by another within 72 hours, the hearing was told.

Information which emerged in the days after 
Capt. Barrie’s death suggested that the gunman’s brother had been shot by the 
Spanish Army in Badghis province in the north west of Afghanistan just 
24 hours before the killing at FOB Shawqat.

It is speculated that Ashraf may have carried out his attack in revenge for his brother getting wounded.

Capt Barrie, from Penicuik in Midlothian, had been mentoring and advising a brigade of the ANA to take over security in an area of southern Afghanistan before he was killed in the 'green-on-blue' attack.

The 41-year-old, of The Royal Scots Borderers, 1st Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, had served for 25 years, including tours of Iraq, Bosnia, Kosovo, Northern Ireland and Afghanistan in 2008.

A post mortem examination revealed he died from a gunshot wound to the chest.

In a statement read to the court, consultant forensic pathologist Dr Nicholas Hunt said the injury had caused 'extremely rapid loss of consciousness and death'.

Private Ryan Houston, who was on duty as a 'Guardian Angel' to patrol the base, told the hearing that he was alerted to the attack when he heard 'a burst of fire'.

'I turned in the direction of the football pitch but I did not see the person holding the weapon,' he said.

'Capt Barrie was not moving and appeared motionless. I think I shouted "man down".'

A smoke grenade was thrown onto the pitch to conceal Capt Barrie’s body from the killer and allow medics to reach him, the inquest heard.

Colour Sergeant George Parker told the inquest that, after hearing the shots, he exchanged fire with the Afghan soldier who then turned and ran off.

Col Sgt Parker and Pte Houston later approached the soldier as he lay on the floor with a gunshot wound to the head.

'I could see he was injured,' Pte Houston said. 'He was alive, he was making gasping sounds.'

Andrew Lumley, Officer Commanding D 
Company, 1 Scots, told the inquest that the shooter had been based at a check
point 150 metres from the base and had gained access by an entrance 
controlled by the ANA.

He revealed the shooting came just 24 hours after a similar attack in Badghis - in which the gunman's brother may have been injured. 

Maj Lumley said: 'It had been briefed on 
that day on November 10 about a green-on-blue in Badghis provice in 
North West Afghanistan where the Spanish Army is the ISAF force.

'There was no intelligence as such that linked the individual in that green-on-blue with anyone in Helmand.'

Tragic:

army for 25 years - including tours of Iraq, Bosnia, Kosovo, Northern 
Ireland and Afghanistan - when he was killed

He went on: 'Over the days that came after Capt Barrie’s death, more information came out about the individual involved.

'As far as we know, it eventually transpired the individual in Badghis was related to Mohammed Ashraf. I believe he had been wounded.'

Col Sgt Parker said relations with members of the ANA on the base were 'generally very good' and they would play football with British troops on an almost daily basis.

Since Capt Barrie’s death, two Guardian Angels and a Guard Commander are now employed at the base and improvements have been made to communications, he added.

Recording his verdict, Oxfordshire coroner Darren Salter said Capt Barrie was unlawfully killed while on active service.

'It does appear the individual acted alone and there has been no evidence linked to insurgents or the Taliban,' he said.

Mr Salter said finding the motive behind the killing involved 'a degree of speculation', although it was thought to have been linked to an earlier insider attack on Spanish troops in Afghanistan in which the rogue soldier’s brother was wounded.

'It may be Mohammad Ashraf was concerned and motivated by that, although we’ll never know for sure,' he added.

The fatal shot was most likely to have been inflicted while Capt Barrie was lying face down on the ground, causing an “extremely rapid loss of consciousness” which led to his death, the coroner said.

Mr Salter described Capt Barrie as a 'highly experienced' soldier who was 'held in high degree' by the Afghan troops he trained, and offered his condolences to Capt Barrie’s wife Sonia and teenage son Callum.
