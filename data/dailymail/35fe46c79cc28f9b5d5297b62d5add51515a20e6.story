The first of five tournaments for Tiger Woods this side of the Masters takes place in Phoenix this week, where the appearance of the 14-time Major champion provides a meaty sub-plot to the goings-on down the road at the Super Bowl.

This will be Woods’s first showing in a regular PGA Tour event since last July, and first tournament anywhere since he finished joint last in the 18-man invitational tournament he hosted in Florida in December.

So forget the missing tooth that sparked headlines last week. Here are five questions Woods must answer during these five events if he isn’t to go missing at Augusta.

Fourteen-time Major winner Tiger Woods feels ready to start his season by playing two events in a row

For Woods to win another Major he must address if he is fit enough to challenge the likes of Rory McIlroy

Thanks to everyone who emailed their thoughts on our campaign to keep live coverage of The Open on free-to-air television. No one thought selling live coverage to Sky would be a smart move for the game. Peter Alliss tells me he’s been getting the same message, following our exclusive interview with the BBC’s voice of golf.

One reader, Stuart Herd, summed up the mood. His daughter was good enough to win the Norfolk Ladies County Championship last year but they cannot afford Sky and so the only chance she gets to watch live golf is The Open and limited coverage of the Masters. Would she have taken up the game at all if she hadn’t had even these morsels for inspiration?

Our amateur bodies do amazing work in unearthing major talents but you do fear they will soon be operating with both hands tied behind their backs, rather than one.

Is he healthy?

Woods is 39 and hasn’t a prayer of giving Rory McIlroy a run for his money unless he can offer a positive update on this one. An unquenchable work ethic was one of the things that gave him his edge and he needs to be able to put in the hard hours once more. Thankfully, there are reasons for cautious optimism. It’s got to be good news that he feels ready to start his season by playing two events in a row. Let’s hope he goes five events without once clutching his lower back or starting to limp.

Can he find the fairway?

While Tiger has been away, McIlroy has taken the art of driving to a new level. He’s consistently hitting the ball 350 yards down the middle. Over the past couple of years, Woods was hitting it 300 and crooked. Although his scorecards didn’t show it, Woods, armed with a more fluid swing, actually drove the ball quite well in that invitation event. Now we wait to see if he can locate enough fairways in PGA Tour events to compete.

Despite showing a more fluid swing the 39-year-old must also compete with McIlroy's consistent driving

‘I did not have a problem (with cocaine). I have issues. But that’s not the issue.’

American Dustin Johnson will presumably be suing all those publications who claimed his six-month break was due to a problem with recreational drugs. Curiously, none of the said outlets have placed their lawyers on high alert.

Has he got the chipping yips?

It was positively shocking to see Tiger, in his last outing, give a passable impersonation of a 24-handicapper at chipping. On six occasions he clunked the ball no more than a few feet in front of him. Logic suggests this will not happen once he gets back into the tournament routine, but it’s not a certainty. Previously, I’d have said Tiger could give up the game for a decade and still not duff six chips on his return.

The Woods of old was a fearless and composed putter during the vital moments - but is that Tiger gone?

Has there ever been a start to a year like this one? Normally January and February are mildly diverting. Now over the next month we’ll see two Ryder Cup captains chosen on either side of the Atlantic, world No 1 McIlroy cross-examined in a Dublin courtroom and, perhaps, the Royal and Ancient Golf Club ending 60 years of tradition and taking live coverage of The Open away from the BBC.

That’s before the actual golf.

Can he still putt under pressure?

Nobody will convince me there was ever anyone to compare to Tiger when it came to holing vital putts. But it’s a sad truism that putting is always the first thing to go, and it’s a long time since we’ve seen him display the sort of fearlessness on the greens that used to be a given.

Can he create some momentum?

On each of the four occasions Tiger won the Masters he did it the same way — building up a head of steam and winning at least one event between January and March. Three of his five tournaments are at places where he has been a serial champion.

He’s won two of them eight times and the other a mere seven. So while it’s not imperative he claims an 80th PGA Tour victory during these five events to have a chance at the Masters, he surely has to contend in at least a couple of them.
