Once upon a time, seeing Manchester United next up in the fixture list would send a shiver down the spine.

For certain clubs, the prospect of facing the Red Devils was such a daunting prospect that the possibility of gaining three points was never even considered.

It would be backs-to-the-wall and all hands to the pump, especially at Old Trafford.

Few teams would get the better of Man United during Sir Alex Ferguson time in charge 

The club's aura of invincibility started to slip under David Moyes last season, with several clubs recording their first wins over United in many years

How times have changed. Since the retirement of Sir Alex Ferguson, clubs who were previously cowed by the United fear factor have been making gains.

Leicester City became the latest on Sunday with their memorable 5-3 win at the King Power Stadium, a result that continued Louis van Gaal's poor start as manager.

It's fair to say this probably wouldn't have happened under Ferguson - Leicester lost 13 of 19 meetings in all competitions during the Scot's long tenure at Old Trafford.

But they are just the latest club to right the wrongs of the past when facing United.

Defeat was the usual story for Leicester when they came up against United. Here, Ruud van Nistelrooy scores in a 4-1 win at Leicester in September 2003

Last season, as David Moyes grappled with the pressure of managing the biggest club in the world, West Brom, Everton, Newcastle, Swansea and Sunderland all took advantage.

Prior to 2013, these were clubs who would consider a point against United a success. With Ferguson gone, they were suddenly unafraid.

In late September last year, West Brom won 2-1 at Old Trafford, inflicting a third league defeat on Moyes even at such an early stage of the season.

Under Ferguson, the Baggies had only won one of 16 meetings in all competitions, losing 12 of them.

In the first week of December, both Everton and Newcastle claimed 1-0 wins at United, boosting wretched records dating back years.

Everton had been regular adversaries for United during Ferguson's reign but they seldom tasted success - losing 35 of 57 meetings and conceding 97 goals overall.

Likewise Newcastle, who had won a mere six of 48 meetings in league and cups during Ferguson's quarter-century at the helm.

Among these dreadful results had been 6-0, 6-2 and 5-1 thrashings. Of course, the poor record made results like the 5-0 win at St James Park in 1996 all the more famous but the general trend was miserable.

Sunderland were another long-standing victim of United. They had triumphed in a paltry three out of 29 meetings under Fergie, losing 20 of them.

Yet they beat United 1-0 at Old Trafford in the Premier League during Ryan Giggs's temporary spell following Moyes's sacking and dumped them out at the semi-final stage of the League Cup.

Swansea eliminated United in the FA Cup third round, their first win over United since January 1982.

And as if to prove that Van Gaal isn't necessarily an improvement on Moyes, the Welsh side beat United 2-1 on the opening day of this season.

United also suffered a humiliating League Cup defeat at the hands of MK Dons earlier in the season

Now Leicester can be added to this list. More will follow if United's woeful start to the season continues.

This is not to mention the humiliating 4-0 thrashing at the hands of MK Dons in the Capital One Cup.

While it's true that United did suffer some giant-killings under Ferguson - notably to York City in 1995 and Southend United in 2006 - they almost always had a weakened team out.

United now look vulnerable to any opponent, the aura of invincibility is long gone. Their opponents are gleefully turning history on its head.
