The worst goal drought in Aston Villa’s history has wiped away the euphoria over the club’s best start to a Premier League campaign since 1998.

Five consecutive goalless defeats have helped propel manager Paul Lambert to bookies’ favourite as the next Premier League sacking.

Lambert might be expected to regard the new four-year contract in his back pocket as a guarantee of job security, given it was only signed in September.

Aston Villa manager Paul Lambert says he has never felt comfortable as a manager and always lives in fear

Lambert remains defiant against the criticism he has received following a run  of five straight goalless defeats

Yet the Villa boss heads into Sunday's home fixture against Tottenham disputing the presence of a safety net. Instead Lambert insists he is living in fear.

‘I enjoy living on the edge,’ said Lambert. ‘There are two ways of going about it: you can come in fighting or run. And I’m never going to run.

‘I know what the game is like. I have never felt comfortable as a manager. I always live in fear. That’s what I like.

‘You have to come through it. It goes from one manager to the next. If you look at which manager is under pressure it is one guy one week, the next the next and another the following week. Everyone gets a hit at it.

‘It’s just the way football works – you just have to turn it around.’

Striker Gabriel Agbonlahor has chipped in with just two goals in eight Premier League appearances for Villa

Christian Benteke continued his recovery from injury by starting a second consecutive league game at QPR

Owner Randy Lerner believed in Lambert six weeks ago but there is a fan base who increasingly need convincing. Losing tomorrow would begin to exert pressure on the chairman too.

The argument from the manager is that Villa lost to Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea and Everton before Monday’s damaging fifth defeat at then-bottom club QPR.

‘We’ve played nine games and this will be our sixth game against last year’s top six,’ added Lambert.

The striker came close scoring at Loftus Road but is still in search of his first Premier League goal this season

‘I’ve been in this position loads of times, even as a player. But you can’t wilt under the pressure. If you are not being criticised people don’t talk about you. You take it.

‘I’m not one to sit on my backside doing nothing. It’s not about monetary things or anything like that, I just want to do my best for this football club. I want to drive it on.

‘I’m not one for sitting comfortably, never.’
