Australia 108 is expected to be so extravagant that residents may have no desire to take another holiday again as the $1billion complex has everything you can think of to make life pretty sweet.

Set to be not only Australia's highest building but also the tallest residential complex in the southern hemisphere - it is no surprise that the 1105-apartment building has attracted unprecedented interest from potential buyers.

The luxurious list of amenities boasts three community facilities with three pools, three gyms, three community lounges, six private dining rooms, private theatrettes, outdoor and indoor aviaries and wait for it - a golf simulator.

The exclusive Star Club enclave devoted to 'health, wellbeing and entertaining' is contained on level 70, or 210 metres from the ground in what is described as a 'two-storey starburst'

The majority of the 3000 square metres of communal space is divided into two realms to provide premium owners with privacy.

Here will sit what is said to be 'Australia's two highest swimming spots'  with the infinity pools set against floor-to-ceiling glass to give swimmers a view of either the glittering city skyline or shimmering bay. 

'There will be not a more spectacular place to take a dip than in Australia 108,' CBRE residential projects managing director Andrew Leoncelli said.

'Not for the faint of heart, these pools offer breathtaking views 210 metres above ground.' 

The club's facilities also extend to dual gymnasiums, private theatrettes, bars, club lounges and private dining areas in which to entertain friends and family.

To add to the resort feel of the design - residents will enjoy both outdoor and indoor aviaries

On level 11 further space is devoted to another pool and gym as well as sauna, steam room, golf simulator, outdoor deck and entertaining spaces.

Bursting through the clouds at the top of the 319-metre complex is a 797.4 square-metre penthouse on the 100th and top floor which expects to fetch a cool $25 million while the cheapest penthouse is likely to fetch a mere $11.5 million. 

This sprawling opulent pad has 800 metres of living space with a 360-degree view of Melbourne.

Mr Leoncelli said the suite is a trophy for a serious property collector. 

At almost double the size of the average Australian home and boasting views that can never be built out, it will catch the eye of those looking for a landmark and iconic address to call home,' he said.

If this this price tag is a tad out of your reach - there are 165 three-four bedroom apartments available from level 72 starting at $1.6 million.

And for those not fussed about hanging out in the clouds -  950 one-two bedroom apartments are up for grabs from $500-$950,000.

Construction starts on the $1 billion building in the middle of this year and the apartments will be released in three installments with the top penthouse expected to be complete in 2019.
