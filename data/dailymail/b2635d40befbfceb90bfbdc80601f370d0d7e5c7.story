A group of footballers suspected of being involved in match-fixing are playing at English clubs with the knowledge of the Football Association, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Following a lengthy investigation by this newspaper into alleged fixing in the Conference South in the 2012-13 season, and into subsequent match-fixing in Australia, top officials from the FA have admitted for the first time they have a ‘watch list’ of active players ‘of interest’ who, for various reasons, they cannot prevent playing.

More than a dozen alleged fixers could be playing in England, according to law enforcement and football integrity sources. The FA will not put a figure on the number.

The players involved are at clubs in the lower reaches of the Football League and in non-League football, yet their CVs show that their former employers range from leading London Premier League clubs to smaller sides across the south.

None of the those on the watch list can be named for legal reasons; not one has been charged or convicted with any fixing offence, hence the FA’s inability to stop them playing.

In some cases, players were involved in games in England where betting and other evidence indicated fixing. A criminal investigation remains possible.

Others have been sought by police elsewhere on fixing-related matters but left for England before they could be questioned.

Asked to confirm the existence of the watch list, the FA’s head of football integrity, David Newton, told The Mail on Sunday in an exclusive interview: ‘It’s safe to say we have procedures in place to manage those sorts of issues.

'We also have the ability within our rules, but only under certain circumstances, to interim suspend players where we believe a sufficient case can be made that they have been in breach of the integrity rules.’

Indeed, it is understood several players have been suspended but the FA will not confirm how many. Watch list players who are not suspended have effectively been put on notice that their activities are being monitored.

Newton said: ‘In the event that we believe somebody is connected in some way [to fixing] we may remind them of their responsibilities.

‘We can seek various written confirmations from them that they have nothing they wish to share with us in terms of breaches of our rules or those of any other body or international association, and they will inform us the minute they do become aware of anything.’

Fears of systematic fixing in England were raised in March last year when the FA announced they had warned Conference South clubs about their ‘responsibilities’, after abnormal betting patterns.

The FA received a document of about 60 pages, detailing ‘suspicious’ matches, specific irregular wagers linked to incidents — and the names of players under suspicion. Betting companies as well as specialist monitoring agents are among those giving the FA such information.

Bookmakers stopped taking bets on matches featuring Billericay Town, AFC Hornchurch and Chelmsford, and other clubs were under scrutiny. The FA liaised with the Gambling Commission, and tried but failed to get a police force involved in the case.

Low-level suspected fixing was not a police priority at that time.

The FA stopped short of starting any investigation of their own. No player or official at any club was questioned. This led to the FA being lambasted by, among others, their own former compliance chief Graham Bean, their former chairman, Lord Triesman, and the chairmen of several clubs linked to ‘dodgy’ matches. 

Bean said the FA had been guilty of a ‘dereliction of duty’ in not investigating. Triesman said he was ‘astonished’ nobody had been questioned, insisting it was the FA’s ‘duty’ to do so.

What happened next raised real concerns that not only had there been malpractice in the Conference, but probably systematic fixing by a major Asian crime syndicate.

Krishna Sanjey Ganeshan

British citizen of Sri Lankan heritage who was jailed in June for five years for a conspiracy to fix matches played in England in November 2013.

Former long-term resident of north London, near Wembley, and latterly Hastings, he was also involved in fixing syndicate working in Australia last year.

Chann Sankaran

Convicted and jailed along with Sanjey Ganeshan of conspiracy to commit bribery relating to matches in November 2013.

Gerry Subramanlam

Jailed for ringleader role in Aussie fixing and linked to Wilson Raj Perumal and Sanjey Ganeshan.

Conference South 2012-13

FA made public announcement in March 2013, reminding 22 clubs of ‘responsibilities’ after suspicious betting patterns, and a dossier from experts identified clubs, games and players believed to be involved in match manipulation. No investigation after police declined to get involved.

Victoria League, Australia

The biggest fixing scandal in Australian history unfolded a year ago at Southern Stars FC in Melbourne.

Convictions have been secured for a group of fixers controlled by a Singapore-based syndicate, including four English players, all former Conference South players.

Various matches in England, Nov 2013

Sanjey Ganeshan and associate Chann Sankaran, a Singaporean fixer, were jailed in June 2014 at Birmingham Crown Court after being found guilty of a conspiracy to commit bribery in a case that centred on English football matches played in November 2013. Both men got five years.

Up to a dozen players who played in that tainted 2012-13 Conference South season, all associated to a UK-based organiser for Asian fixers — Krishna Sanjey Ganeshan — were recruited by him to play at regional level in Australia. Four players, all English, have since been convicted of match-fixing while at a Melbourne club, Southern Stars, and have been banned from football for life.

Ganeshan was jailed in June for five years at Birmingham Crown Court for conspiracy to fix English matches played in November 2013 — matches entirely unrelated to either the season before or Australia.

‘It seems pretty clear now that there was match manipulation in England in the 2012-13 season, and it went uninvestigated, and some of those involved went on to be involved in Australia, including Ganeshan,’ said one veteran police source.

‘People got away with stuff in England. Some also got away with it in Australia. I’m sure the FA have an idea who they are.’

Football’s integrity ‘landscape’ has changed dramatically in England even since March 2013. The National Crime Agency (NCA), a new law enforcement agency with the appetite and power to go after fixers, has come into existence. It became fully operational in October 2013.

It was an NCA investigation, prompted by investigative newspaper work, that led to the imprisonment of Ganeshan and two associates. The NCA continue to probe other alleged fixing, and receive support from the FA.

Nobody at the FA will publicly blame police inertia before the NCA was established for the lack of investigation into the suspected 2012-13 fixing.

But Darren Bailey, the FA’s director of governance and regulation, said: ‘These matters are now treated with the utmost seriousness by all the relevant agencies. We’re a lot happier in relation to the manner in which these matters are dealt with now.’

The significant words are ‘now’ and ‘all the relevant agencies’. In relation to the 2012-13 season, Bailey said the FA followed every procedure they were supposed to, and could not simply start banging on doors to find answers in case they compromised a subsequent formal criminal investigation by police.

‘It’s not like in the old days when you can go in like the Sweeney and just interview some person,’ he said.

As well as being an FA director, Bailey is also a key figure in a ‘tripartite organisation’ — comprised of sports bodies, the betting industry and the police — that meets regularly to share information and discuss strategy.

Like the NCA, it is relatively new, and aims to tackle corruption.

‘We cannot do it as a sport on our own,’ said Bailey. ‘We have limited power, (only) over our participants. We don’t necessarily have all of the investigative powers that other bodies have. So we do need their assistance.’

On the issue of whether the law may catch up with past fixers who are still at liberty, perhaps even playing while on the watch list, FA integrity chief Newton added: ‘We’re not saying there is a big line under any case.’
