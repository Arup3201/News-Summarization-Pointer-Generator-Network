Parents at a primary school have slammed a decision to take all fish off the menu and ban it from packed lunches - because one pupil is allergic.

Robert Le Kyng Primary SchoolÂ in Swindon, Wiltshire, sent the letter explaining the new pupil suffers severe reactions to haddock and tuna and a blanket ban was needed to avoid any risks.

The ban means fish and chips is now off the menu as well as all other dishes, such as fish finger sandwiches.

Robert Le Kyng Primary School in Swindon, Wiltshire, sent the letter explaining the new pupil suffers severe reactions to haddock and tuna and a blanket ban was needed to avoid any risks

It also means that all children must refrain from having fish in their lunchboxes.

Headteacher Susan Smith said the menu change was necessary to protect the unnamed girl at the school, but parents slammed the move as 'over the top'.

In a letter sent to the school's 415 pupils, she said: 'This decision was not reached without seeking advice from the relevant medical professionals involved with this child.

'In this case, the child in question will be joining us full-time in September, but is coming in part-time until then as part of an extended induction.

'She has had severe reactions, not just to the smell of cooking fish, but also when her mother touched her after eating a tuna sandwich'

Off the menu: Dishes like fish and chips will no longer be served and pupils cannot bring tuna sandwiches to school

She added: 'This is about the life-threatening nature of the reaction.

'The school nurse has said it is a balance between a dietary change and a life-threatening issue, and we have to protect the children under our care.

'That is why we have asked for lots more detail so we can make a more informed decision.

'We can't completely avoid the risk, and that is why we have done additional training, and we are constantly reviewing the situation.

'We appreciate this is quite a large response but at the moment it is necessary. She has had quite severe reactions, and has been in hospital as a result.

'The reactions so far have been to haddock, tuna and one other fish. It is very unusual.

Annoyed: Adele Oliver, who has three children at the school, said her daughter will only eat tuna

Parents outside Robert Le Kyng primary school in Swindon yesterday slammed the ban on fish.

Adele Oliver, who has three children at the school, said her daughter will only eat tuna and the headteacher has advised her to give dry bread instead.

She said: 'My daughter eats tuna every day. That is all she eats.

'She likes chocolate spread but I'm not prepared to give her chocolate spread sandwiches every day because that isn't healthy.

'The headmistress has suggested that she just has bread and butter which I think is absolutely disgusting.'

Adele added that her daughter has already been asked to eat her tuna sandwiches in isolation when the pupil with the allergy visited the school.

She said: 'I work nights and I have to get up at lunchtime and bring her over a tuna sandwich and she has been put in a room by herself when I have given her tuna.

'We've had a meeting to discuss all these other things she's allergic to but in my eyes if her allergies are so severe she shouldn't be in a mainstream school.

'I know she has every right to be educated but if they are so severe she shouldn't be coming to a mainstream school.

'There are over 400 kids in that school and for one child everybody is going out a limb to do everything for her because it is life-threatening.

'It's like sod everyone else. To me, she (my daughter) is my priority - she has to eat every day.

'If she had a serious allergy where she had to eat fish every day, who are they going to make sit outside?

'I am being patient but when you are stressed everyday about what she is going to eat, that's what annoys me. This girl is only in two days a week anyway, she doesn't start in reception until September.'

Kirsty Sage, 32, from Swindon, said for a lot of parents it will be difficult to find alternatives as children can be fussy eaters

Kirsty Sage, 32, whose six-year-old daughter attends the school, said: 'I really don't agree with the policy.

'My child is a very fussy eater and it can be difficult to get her to eat quite a few things.

'Luckily for me she will eat things other than fish but for a lot of parents it will be difficult to find alternatives.

'It seems out of order making everyone change their eating habits for the sake of one pupil.'

But Maz Hyde, 26, said that she wasn't particularly bothered about the new policy.

'I can definitely see why they would do it but it seems like quite a dramatic step - it's a pretty big policy," she said.

'I'm not really that annoyed by it because luckily my son eats other things but it could make things difficult for other parents.'

'As a school with a Special Resource Provision for children with physical disability, we do have children with complex physical and medical needs in the school.'

'This means that sometimes there are minor adaptations that need to be made.'

Mrs Smith added that she hoped after more tests by the girl's doctors, the school may be able to alter the ban to make it more specific.

'We do understand that this will have an impact on the choices and diet of some of the other children in our care and this decision was not taken lightly,' she said.

'We hope that over time, as the child has more medical investigations, they will be able to pinpoint the allergies accurately and we will be able to be more specific about what we need to avoid.

'I fully understand that it will have an impact on what can go in children's lunchboxes and if there were an alternative, I would not have taken such a drastic step.'

Parent Lee East, who has a 10-year-old daughter at the school with a peanut allergy, thought the measures seemed harsh.

He said: 'My daughter has her medication with her at school and with her friends they know she has an allergy and they are very careful around her.

'She doesn't want her friends to suffer because of her allergy. I don't see how this is grounds for banning it.

'If they are going to review it then that's fine. We have been through the same thing.

'My daughter has been into the hospital and had all the same challenges. It just seems that this is going over the top.'

This common food allergy includes everything from snail, clams, mussels, oysters, crab, lobster, shrimp, prawn, cod and salmon.

Typical
 symptoms include nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps, wheezing, 
flushing, rashes and dramatic swelling of the airways. Some patients 
even report that the smell of seafood during cooking causes a problem.

In severe cases, food allergies can cause an anaphylactic reaction - when the body goes into shock.

Sufferers
 should avoid all seafood and locations where seafood is cooked as 
sensitive patients may react to allergens present in the vapours of 
cooking shellfish. Doctors may prescribe an EpiPen (a medical device 
used to deliver a measured dose of epinephrine to combat anaphlyaxis).
