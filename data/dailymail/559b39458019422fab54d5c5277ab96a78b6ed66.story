The White House may have to scrap its plans to aggressively promote a 40 per cent national minimum wage hike now that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found that the move would likely cost the U.S. 500,000 jobs by the second half of 2016.

The CBO's report, released Tuesday afternoon, also estimated that it would pull 900,000 low-income Americans above the federal government's poverty line.

The White House didn't answer questions about whether that trade-off is acceptable to President Obama, but Senate Democrats have pushed hard for legislation that would implement his goal of driving the minimum wage far above its current $7.25 level.

But it quickly scheduled an afternoon conference call for reporters with Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Jason Furman, and published a blog post so lengthy that it suggests the White House had advance notice of the CBO's findings.

President Barack Obama posed with a group of workers before signing an executive order to raise the minimum wage for federal contract workers to $10.10 an hour -- but his larger effort, which requires Congress to act, is now meeting with the CBO's brick wall

The CBO says as many as 1 million jobs might be lost after a minimum wage hike to $10.10 per hour, but determined that its 'central estimate' was 500,000 jobs

That article didn't mention the report's 500,000-job estimate, but argued more vaguely that CBO said 'raising the minimum wage would increase income for millions of middle-class families, on net, even after accounting for its estimates of job losses.'

The president signed an executive order on February 12 setting $10.10 as the minimum wage for employees working on new federal contracts, and has said he wants legislators to expand his order to the entire country.

A conservative policy group, the Employment Policies Institute, has predicted the CBO's findings for years, saying that a $10.10 minimum wage would kill between 360,000 and 1 million jobs, mostly those of young, low-skill workers who would be the first to go if employers were forced to pay higher salaries out of the same pool of money.

The group's research director, Michael Saltsman, said Tuesday that Obama's plan would be 'a blunt instrument to fix the very complicated issue of poverty in America.'

'Nearly 60 percent of the working-age poor don’t have a job and wouldn’t be affected by a raise,' he said. 'Of those who would receive a raise, a forthcoming study from Cornell and San Diego State University economists find just 13 percent live in poor families.'

Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn quickly piled on.

'Whether it's Obamacare, a minimum wage hike or a trillion-dollar stimulus bill charged to the nation’s credit card, the bottom line is the President's big-government experiment kills jobs,' he said.

'It has made things worse not only for Americans who continue to look for a job, but also for the millions of Americans who have altogether given up looking for work.'

Union labor has organized protests across the country to demand a minimum-wage hike, since many union contracts include higher wages that rise whenever the minimum wage goes up

Senate Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell's re-election campaign issued a statement after the CBO published its report, comparing its dour findings to news about Obamacare.

Liberals, he said, 'promise a world full of prosperity, but the reality of their policies is fewer jobs and less opportunity for our most vulnerable.'

But the Obama administration went on full alert.

In his conference call, Furman told reporters that the CBO was dead wrong, and its report 'does not reflect the consensus view of economists who have said the minimum wage would have little to no impact on employment.'

Tuesday's news will put pressure on Democrats and labor unions to justify their call for a higher minimum wage as a net benefit to the American economy.

'It goes outside the consensus view of economists when it comes to the impact of the minimum wage on employment,' he said.

'Our view is that "zero" is a perfectly reasonable estimate of the impact of the minimum wage on employment.'

The White House has planned to spend much of next week promoting President Obama's plan as a boon to jobs and the economy, and as a social justice issue aimed at better treatment of America's poor.

The president and his surrogates are likely to point to the CBO's other findings, including that 'many more low-wage workers would see an increase in their earnings,' and that 'a few higher-wage workers would owe their jobs and increased earnings to the heightened demand for goods and services that would result.'

CBO's economists called a loss of 500,000 jobs its 'central estimate,' but said there is great uncertainty attached to it.

A 'very slight' reduction in jobs could also result, they cautioned, or job losses as large as 1 million.

Overall, 16.5 million American workers would see higher pay if the minimum wage were increased.

The president claimed in his weekend radio address that 'raising the minimum wage ... would lift wages for about 28 million Americans.  It would lift millions of Americans out of poverty, and help millions more work their way out of poverty – without requiring a single dollar in new taxes or spending.

Separately, the CBO wrote last week that the Affordable Care Act, the president's signature health insurance overhaul law, would drive the equivalent of 2.5 million full-time jobs out of the U.S. economy by the year 2024.

President Obama has demanded a national hike in the minimum wage to $10.10 per hour

@highlight

He signed an executive order last week making that move for federal contract employees

@highlight

But the Congressional Budget Office now says a national push for that wage floor would likely remove 500,000 jobs from the U.S. economy

@highlight

The White House had planned to spend next week promoting the wage hike idea, hoping to convince Congress to act

@highlight

The CBO also said that 900,000 Americans would be hoisted above the poverty level if the wage went up according to Obama's plan
