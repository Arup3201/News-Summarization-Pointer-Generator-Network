The father of a Michigan state trooper shot dead during a routine traffic stop confronted the pregnant wife of the man accused of killing his son.

As he handed her a family photo, Paul Butterfield accused a weeping Sarah Renee Knysz of crying only because she had been caught.

The 20-year-old was being sentenced for helping her husband Eric Knysz get away after State Trooper Paul K Butterfield was shot in the head.

Tears: As Knysz wept in court Paul Butterfield accused her of crying because she had been caught rather than being upset at the death of his son

Sarah Knysz was sentenced to between two and five years for accessory after the fact to a felon on Tuesday, but despite the victim's father and fiancee being in court she offered no apology.

Before the sentencing, Mr Butterfield Sr handed her a family photo and told her: 'I have seen your tears. I believe your tears are not a 
result of sorrow for our son’s death, but because you got caught.'

After telling the court the happiest day of his life was when his son was born, he turned to Knysz, who is nine months pregnant, and said: 'I hope for the sake of [your] child 
that he or she is removed totally from your family and adopted [by a 
loving, stable family].'

Knysz, who was in the car at the time of the shooting had told the court it was out of fear for her life and that of her unborn child that she protected her husband after the shooting, M Live reported.

'There wasn’t anything that I thought
I could have done that day,' she said.

'He had a gun and he 
shot the trooper, and if he did that, what was he going to do to a 
witness that was going to tell on him and was going to turn him in? I 
just wanted to keep me and my baby safe. I was just thinking about my 
baby.'

She added: 'I didn’t mean for any of this to happen, and I didn’t have control over it happening.'

Eric
Knysz, 19, who is due to stand trial for murder in February, admitted 
shooting the trooper in the head as he approached their pick up truck at
about 6.30pm on September 9.

Devastated: Jennifer Sielski tells the court about the last moments she spent with fiancee Paul Butterfield

Loss: Paul Butterfield was on a routine traffic stop when he was killed by the roadside

The body of the recently engaged officer was found by a passing motorist.

After the shooting, Sarah Knysz removed her cell phone battery and erased its memory and helped her husband move belongings from the pick up truck to a car he had stolen.

Despite being seen in two stores afterwards she did nothing to raise the alarm, the court was told.

The victim's fiancee, Jennifer Sielski, told the court, Butterfield made her feel 'like the luckiest woman in 
the world ... He protected me when I needed to feel safe. He 
was my friend, my inspiration, my hero, my soulmate.'

As she broke down in tears repeatedly during her statement, Miss Sielski told how her unused wedding dress was now hanging in the couple's closet next to Trooper Butterfield's uniform, Wood TV reported.

She recalled her last kiss with the trooper, who she saw briefly on the evening he died as he left for work, and said when she got the call that he had been injured 'her world stopped'.

Jailed: Sarah Knysz, who is nine months pregnant, was sentenced to between two and five years in prison

'I returned home from work, gave Paul a kiss and told 
Paul I loved him before he started his shift at 6pm something I had 
done countless times. But that time would be the last,' she said.

'Twenty
minutes later, Paul lay on the road ... clinging to life ... as Eric 
and his wife, Sarah, fled toward freedom they were literally willing to 
kill for.'

Eric Knysz is due to stand trial for murder of a peace officer, felony 
firearm, carrying a concealed weapon and motor vehicle theft.
