We are in the car, en route to the airport for our summer holiday, when a piercing shriek from the back causes my husband Keith to slam on the brakes and pull over to the side of the road.

Turning round to deal with whatever emergency awaits, we are faced with the stricken faces of our two teenage daughters. 'We forgot the hair straighteners,' they wail. 'You'll have to go back.'

Returning home isn’t an option, but once through airport security, Flo and Annie rush off in a panic to search for the requisite irons in the shops - apparently, only GHD (Good Hair Day) ones will do. 

Double-take: Shona's girls Annie, left, and Flo dress like many other teens

When they fail, the pair board the plane as if they’ve just been sentenced to ten years' hard labour - not heading for fun in the Mediterranean sunshine.

While many mothers will join me in raising an eyebrow in amused exasperation, I can't help thinking my daughters' behaviour reflects something far more disturbing about teenage girls - that they have become a generation of vapid clones for whom a preoccupation with looks and appearance takes precedence over everything else.

From what I have observed of my oldest daughters - Flo is nearly 15, Annie, almost 13 - it comes as absolutely no surprise that new research reveals teenage girls are under almost unbearable stress to aspire to a glossy, ideal image of beauty.

Clones: They look up to TOWIE stars such as Sam Faiers and Billie Faiers and TV presenter Holly Willoughby, right

This rarely exists outside the photo-shopped pages of celebrity magazines and the artificial world of scripted reality shows such as The Only Way Is Essex and Made In Chelsea.

This has been backed up by the views of several experts, including U.S. lecturer and film-maker Jean Kilbourne, who, for decades, has been documenting how mass culture represents women.

'In the past 40 years, culture has stepped beyond setting an ideal image of beauty for women to aspire to; now it sets an impossible image,' she says.

'The girls consider it a crime worse than
 death to leave the house without mascara. Neither will countenance 
wearing a skirt longer than the middle of their thighs'

As a result, a generation of copycats is emerging, all with long, straightened hair (preferably blonde), stick thin figures, caramel tans and the heavy make-up that their role models are never seen without.

When Flo and Annie wander along our local High Street on a Saturday afternoon, it is impossible to spot them among the sea of identikit teens. For they and all their peers are equally desperate to ape this unachievable celebrity ideal.

They gather in hordes, wearing identical Topshop outfits, hairstyles and shoes. Disturbingly, they are all so in synch it is not dissimilar to witnessing a North Korean army on parade.

This Stepford-style mentality causes me constant angst. Have I failed my teenage daughters by allowing them to become so shallow and vain? They even talk the same and use all the same expressions.

Last term, Flo started at boarding school. I was expecting a rocky first few days - teary phone calls and homesickness - but I heard nothing for a fortnight. 

Loss of individuality: Shona wishes her daughters could be more unique like they were when they were younger

Then, finally, my mobile rang. 'At last,' I thought, silently pleased. 'She's finally missing me.'

But rather than the emotional conversation I was hoping for, what I got was this: 'Mum, my waterproof mascara has run out and so has my BB cream. Could you organise an overnight courier?'

So, where, I wonder, has their originality and uniqueness gone? Annie is not yet even an 'official' teenager, yet her make-up bag is overflowing with more products than I possess. Flo and Annie have a uniform of outfits - tight black leggings, teeny shorts and cropped tops - that they swap between themselves, but otherwise refuse to deviate from.

'It seems as if the shallow celebrity 
culture we live in is somehow sucking the very soul out of my lovely 
girls and turning them into something vacuous'

They have been blessed with beautiful long blonde hair, which, even though they don't have a curl in sight, they still spend an hour each morning straightening as flat as a ruler.

The girls consider it a crime worse than death to leave the house without mascara. Neither will countenance wearing a skirt longer than the middle of their thighs.

As sisters, they do, of course, look similar. You might think that because of this, they would want to inject some individuality into their appearance. But on the contrary, they are utterly determined to look like carbon copies of each other - and every other teenager within a five-mile radius.

You might argue that teenagers have always been the same - materialistic and obsessed with themselves. Yet as I look at my two girls, staring at their images in every mirror they pass, I can't help thinking they are a world away from my Eighties' self.

Back in 1985, at the age of 14, I remember being hell-bent on standing out from the crowd. For me, being a teenager was all about experimenting, revelling in my emerging personality and expressing myself to the world. 

Narrow-minded: Flo and Annie have set ideas on their appearances and don't like to deviate from what is 'cool'

I remember perming my hair, dying it ink black and using henna to turn it red, all in the same year.

But it wasn't just about my generation's different attitude towards looks. The Eighties were a fun-filled decade. Despite being at a strict all-girls' convent school, I felt that I could goof around and be myself.

It didn’t matter that I wore braces, had no boobs to speak of and mousy hair. No two of my friends looked the same and, anyway, we wouldn’t have wanted to. Our idols were Madonna, Whitney Houston and Alexis off Dynasty - three women who couldn’t be more different.

We weren't bombarded with the same homogenous images that my daughters are. There were no rules on what to look like and no one to sneer at us if we got it wrong. Sadly, all that is in stark contrast to the modern world.

'Short of plonking them on a desert 
island away from the superficial rubbish they are bombarded with, I am 
at a loss over what to do'

Abigail Tazzyman, an academic at York University, who studies the grooming habits of women aged 18 to 25, says girls report a great hostility to anyone who doesn't look the same.

'The spectrum of what is acceptable is very small,' she says. 'It is not, for example, enough that girls must all have straight hair. They must use GHD straighteners.'

Flo and Annie will go even further. They can be ruthlessly critical of each other. I have watched Annie put together an outfit, having carefully studied her older sister, only for Flo to cast a single damning glance because the skirt she is wearing is a millimetre too long or it's 'not cool' with her shoes.

Then Flo will put on almost identical clothes and deem them acceptable because they have been bought from Topshop not Primark, or some Z-list celebrity she is following on Twitter wore something similar a week ago.

I watch these blossoming girls on the brink of womanhood and I can't help despairing. It’s not just the fact that everything they want to wear is so tight, so revealing, dare I say it, slutty. It's that they appear to have lost something of the wonderful uniqueness they once had.

Can it really be so long ago that Flo would dance down a pavement, oblivious to everyone around her? Or that Annie would walk to the local shop wearing a onesie and a silly hat just to see what people's reactions would be? 

I can remember feeling so proud of my girls and their robust sense of self. They have strong personalities and, up until recently, seemed to have refreshingly clear ideas of what they liked and didn't.

Now they are infuriatingly narrow-minded. If Kim Kardashian thinks it's OK, then it's OK. If Cara Delevingne has worn it (or similar), then fine. Otherwise, forget it.

Of course, teenagers all succumb to peer pressure during the turbulent crossing from child to adult. But this feels different. It seems as if the shallow celebrity culture we live in is somehow sucking the very soul out of my lovely girls and turning them into something vacuous.

I have no idea how to stop the rot from setting in. Short of plonking them on a desert island away from the superficial rubbish they are bombarded with, I am at a loss over what to do.

I simply have to cross my fingers and hope it’s a passing phase that will see them emerging from their bedrooms looking like the two individuals I know they are.

In the meantime, along with every other mother of a teenage girl, I can only pray that someone on TOWIE deems it cool to cut their hair, cover up and lose the mascara.
