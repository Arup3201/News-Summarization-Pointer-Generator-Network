Women who get breast implants do have improved sex lives - but not for the reason they might think, a psychologist has claimed.

Instead of having increased body confidence, it is the fact a woman has spent money on herself that gives her a boost in the bedroom, says Tomi-Ann Roberts, a professor of psychology at Colorado College.

'When
 we have exerted a great effort, spent a great deal of money and effort 
and time on something, we tend to justify that effort,' she said. 'Our good feeling is increased because of the effort, not the thing 
itself.'

Women who get breast implants do have improved sex lives - but not for the reason they might think, a psychologist has claimed. Instead of having increased body confidence, it is the fact a woman has spent money on herself that gives her a boost in the bedroom

Professor Roberts was speaking following a study by Brazilian researchers which found that women experienced a significant boost to their arousal and sexual satisfaction following the procedure.

The study involved 45 women who planned to undergo breast implant surgery.

Researcher Dr. Paulo Guimaraes and 
colleagues asked the women to fill out a questionnaire before the 
surgery that assessed their sexual desire, arousal and sexual 
satisfaction. Patients were then asked to retake the questionnaire at 
two, four and 18 months after surgery.

Nine women with stretch marks following 
their plastic surgery did not report any improvement. Stretch marks can 
occur if the implant is significantly larger than the original breast 
was, according to the ASPS.

But the 36 women who did 
not develop stretch marks after surgery said they had experienced 
improved levels of arousal and were more satisfied with their sex lives.
 They reported this improvement at both four and 18 months following 
surgery.

Commenting on the findings, Professor Roberts said: 'Here are 45 women who spent a 
great deal of time and money and effort augmenting their breasts because
 the media has clearly convinced them their breasts are inadequate.so 
we shouldn't be surprised they are pleased with the breast 
augmentation.'

But other experts argue post-surgery confidence in the bedroom is because a woman now feels that her outward body now fits her inward persona

Professor Roberts, who is also a member of the American Psychological 
Association's task force on the sexualisation of girls, added she wasn't surprised that women felt more attractive in the bedroom after surgery. 

'Feminine heterosexuality is very 
much about our sense of whether or not we are pleasing our partner, and 
here we have 45 women who have spent a great deal of money to that 
purpose.

'f these breasts are now pleasing to their male partners, then 
they are likely to feel more sexually attractive.

'There
 are a lot of other things breasts are a part of. This is an indication 
that in our Victoria's Secret culture, breasts are for men. They are for
 men's pleasure,' she said.

But Dr David 
Reath, chair of the public education committee of the American Society 
of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS), disagrees. 

'When I see patients and follow up, a lot
 of them will say "My husband and I or my boyfriend and I are having a 
lot of fun". ' Why not? It's an important part of life,' he said.

'I
 think that the female breast is a very important part of a woman's 
body, in terms of how a woman feels about herself in public, how her 
clothes fit and how she feels about herself sexually.

'It's very common for a woman post-surgery to say she feels more confident, that her outward body now fits her inward persona.'

'[The study] found that in the areas of both sexual satisfaction and sexual arousal, there were significantly increased feelings,' said These aspects of the sexual experience were increased for these women.'

The findings are to be presented this 
week at the ASPS annual meeting in San Diego.
