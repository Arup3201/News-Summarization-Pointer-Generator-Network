Millions of people with fixed price energy tariffs will not get a £50 reduction in bills promised by David Cameron.

The energy giant E.ON yesterday announced that more than one million of its customers will get a reduction of only £12 – or 23p a week.

EDF is taking the same line with its one million fixed rate customers, who include many pensioners and families. Npower, SSE and Scottish Power may follow suit.

The decision is at odds with Government promises and British Gas, which announced a £53 cut for all customers.

On average bills will be £60 higher than before this year's round of price hikes even after the government deal to reduce green levies by £50

The Prime Minister, Chancellor George Osborne and Energy Secretary Ed Davey have made repeated pledges to protect customers by rolling back green levies.

Mr Osborne said this week: ‘There’s going to be an average of £50 off people’s bills … We are absolutely insistent that this is going to be brought in.’

Last night, Mr Davey’s Energy and Climate Change Department made clear they expected all customers to get the full reduction.

A spokesman said: ‘We have announced a package that should lead to households seeing an average saving of around £50 a year.

‘There is no practical bar to these 
savings being passed on to consumers on fixed tariffs and our 
expectation is that all consumers will benefit from the £50 discount.’

The Big Six energy firms have agreed to pass on the £50 saving to customers

The smaller reduction of £12 covers the Government’s decision to switch funding of the Warm Homes Discount – a subsidy for poorer families – from bills to general taxation. The rest of the decrease was expected to come from changes to the Energy Companies’ Obligation scheme, a levy applied to all bills to raise money for energy-saving measures for poorer households.

However, this element of the reduction is not being passed on to customers on fixed tariff deals by some companies.

In contrast, British Gas, the largest of the ‘big six’ suppliers, announced that all customers on all tariffs and payment methods will get a reduction of £53 from January 1.

Audrey Gallacher, of campaign group Consumer Futures, said: ‘The message has been that people were going to save £50 on their energy bill, but it seems a  fair chunk of people will not get that. This sort of behaviour is not going to do anything to reassure customers … People feel confused and angry about their energy bills. This latest development just adds insult to injury.’

She added: ‘I think in the current climate, bearing in mind how people are struggling, the right thing to do would be to apply the full reduction across the board. That is the expectation that the Government has created.’

E.ON announced yesterday a price rise of almost £60 a year for customers on standard tariffs. The changes will take effect from January 18.

A spokesman for the provider said cutting the bills of fixed price customers by only £12 was justified because many of these people were already on relatively good tariffs.

EDF took a similar line and said its short-term fixed deal is some £90 a year cheaper than its new standard prices.

Chancellor George Osborne used his Autumn Statement to boast of cutting bills by £50
