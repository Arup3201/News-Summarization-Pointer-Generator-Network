Overhaul: Education secretary Michael Gove is planning changes to A Levels

Education secretary Michael Gove is planning to introduce changes to the A-level system in the next stage of his overhaul of the examination system, it was claimed last night.

Mr Gove is said to be developing an Advanced Baccalaureate which would see students studying a mixture of A-level subjects, writing a 5,000-word essay and undertaking voluntary work.

The plans are being developed soon after Mr Gove announced he would scrap GCSEs in core subjects and replace them with tougher new exams.

If his proposals are enacted it would mean the entire exam system for secondary schools will have been replaced in the space of thee years.

The new baccalaureate system would require A-level students to study ‘contrasting’ subjects to give them a broad education, The Times reported last night.

A candidate who chose A levels in maths, further maths and physics, for example, would be expected to pick a humanity, such as history or French, as a fourth subject.

Mr Gove also wants shorter and more open-ended questions in exams.

One option he is apparently considering is to limit the A-Bacc to teenagers who choose at least two A levels from a list of subjects specified by Russell Group universities - maths, further maths, English literature, physics, biology, chemistry, geography, history, and modern and classical languages.

Universities want to keep the present system in which candidates typically study four AS levels, with grades awarded after a year, and continue with three subjects for a final year, known as A2, which together comprise a full A level.

AS-level grades are widely used by universities to select applicants for admissions offers.

But some academics want the Education Secretary to restore traditional A levels with exams at the end of the course. 

Changing times: The reform would see students studying 'contrasting' subjects, writing a 5,000 word essay and doing voluntary work

They say many undergraduates arrive at university unprepared for intensive study, especially in maths and physics.

The A-Bacc would be based loosely on the International Baccalaureate diploma but would keep the subject specialism of A levels.

They would also undertake voluntary work alongside their academic studies.

From 2015, GCSEs in core subjects will be replaced with new exams called the English Baccalaureate Certificate.

The E-Bacc has been controversial, with many teachers saying that it is too prescriptive.

Labour are planning a Technical Baccalaureate or ‘Tech Bacc’ for 18-year-olds, involving technical qualifications alongside GCSEs and a programme of work experience.

The Department for Education last night stressed that A-levels were not going to be scrapped, but conceded that discussions were ongoing about plans to reform further education.

A spokesman said: ‘A-levels will not be replaced under any circumstances. There are public consultations about reforming A and AS levels.

‘There are also numerous suggestions about new ABacc league table measures but no decisions have been made.’
