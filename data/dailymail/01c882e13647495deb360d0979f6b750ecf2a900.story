LeBron James had an explanation up his sleeve for his off-shooting night on Thursday when the Miami Heat lost 111-87 to the San Antonio Spurs. He blamed his bad game on the NBA's new short sleeved fashion.

James shot 6-of-18 during the game, setting the record for his second-worst shooting night of the season.

'Iâ€™m not making excuses, but Iâ€™m not a big fan of the jerseys,' James told reporters following the loss.

'Every time I shoot it feels like it's just pulling right up underneath my arm. I already don't have much room for error on my jump shot. It's definitely not a good thing.'

The short-sleeved jerseys were introduced to the NBA this season and are flying off the shelves of stores as they are very popular with fans, reports ESPN.

James is not a fan of the jerseys and told reporters that it affects his long range shots.

James alluded to a game on Christmas Day when he wore one of the short-sleeved jerseys and shot 0-of-4 from a 3-point-range in a game with the Los Angeles Lakers.

Thursday was a night of mishaps for LeBron who later took off the plastic mask he wears to protect his broken nose because it 'bothered him.'

'I don't like it,' James said. 'I got a message from my wife at halftime telling me to put it back on so I may be in trouble when I get home.'

As for the short sleeved jerseys, LeBron wasn't the only player to complain about the restrictive style.

However, the NBA disputes that shooting percentages are the same regardless of whether a person is wearing a short sleeved jersey or not.

'We know that shooting percentages are virtually exactly the same for games in which we have sleeved jerseys and teams in which the guys are wearing conventional jerseys,' NBA commissioner Adam Silver said over All-Star Weekend.

'So I'm pretty comfortable from a competitive standpoint that it's having no impact.'

James is done wearing the short sleeved Jerseys this season and is pretty thrilled about it but knows there will be a game in the future for which he'll have to wear the Jersey.

'I have to figure something out the next time I have to wear them,' James said.
