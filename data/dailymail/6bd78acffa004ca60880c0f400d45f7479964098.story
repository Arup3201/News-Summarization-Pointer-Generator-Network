Police say an unemployed couple facing eviction admitted swiping a Salvation Army donation bucket from a Pittsburgh-area convenience store so they could use the cash to buy drugs.

Joshua Basinger and Rachel Pecharka were arrested on Tuesday in McDonald, Pennsylvania, and charged with theft, receiving stolen property and criminal conspiracy.

Police say the 30-year-old Basinger and 21-year-old Pecharka told officers they emptied the bucket of cash after last Friday's theft and threw it into an Aliquippa trash bin.

Police posted surveillance photos of the suspects on the department's Facebook page.

They say anonymous tips led them to Basinger and Pecharka.

'They have been at the store in the past,' said McDonald Police Officer Michael Dhanse to CBS.

'They stated the money in the canister was there and they went to obtain that. They parked around the corner to hide their vehicle, so if someone saw them, they couldn’t stop them.'

Residents were able to identify the alleged perpetrators from photographs.

In the system: Residents were able to identify the alleged perpetrators from photographs and police realized they had the suspects in their database 

Frequent visitors: Joshua Basinger and Rachel Pecharka had been to this convenience store before and they told police they planned to take the Salvation Army bucket so they could pay for heroin

'We actually received a couple of names from the public, stating the name of the couple involved,' said Dhanse.

'So we looked and found that we had them in our data base and we were able to identify them and locate their residence.'

Police say that the suspects threw the kettle in a dumpster and that they felt sorry for their actions. They explained to police that they were drug addicts.

‘They did feel bad about doing this,’ Dhanse said.

‘They had been addicts of heroin lately, so they did this to get money for their fix. They state they thought about this for a while and they went to TJs so they could get drugs.’

Court records with information on the couple's lawyers were not immediately available.

McDonald is about 18 miles southwest of Pittsburgh.
