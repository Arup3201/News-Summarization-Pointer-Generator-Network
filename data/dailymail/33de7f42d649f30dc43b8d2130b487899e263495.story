It is one of nature’s great ocean explorers, a giant creature that swims 13,000 miles in a year and can live to the age of 100.

But rather than roaming the seven seas, this 34-stone leatherback sea turtle is undergoing treatment in a US aquarium after it swallowed a floating plastic bag.

The leatherback, nicknamed Yawkey, was found dangerously ill on a remote beach in South Carolina.

Experts said it became stranded after it mistook a billowing plastic bag for the jellyfish it feeds on – a common problem which kills countless sea turtles every year.

Eating plastic could cause a build-up of gas in the digestive tract, making the turtle buoyant and washing it to shore.

The incident is a stark illustration of the damage humans are doing to the environment by dumping millions of tons of plastic rubbish into our oceans.

Recent studies estimate 8million tons of bags, bottles, toys and other rubbish ends up in the seas each year – affecting up to 400 different marine species, many of them endangered.

The Daily Mail has been campaigning since 2008 for tougher action to reduce plastic bag waste. A major victory in the Banish the Bags campaign came in June last year when a 5p charge for plastic bags was announced in England. 

The charge, which will be introduced by October, is expected to reduce bag use by up to 80 per cent and raise up to £100million a year for good causes. 

The aquarium hopes to release Yawkey soon because leatherbacks do not cope well in captivity

Wildlife experts rescued the rare leatherback from a beach on Saturday. Kelly Thorvalson, a turtle expert at the South Carolina Aquarium Sea Turtle Hospital in Charleston, said it took five people to haul the giant beast from the beach.

They rode in a 4x4 truck through mud and marshland to get to the leatherback, before using a winch to get it on to the vehicle. 

There were few signs of external injury to the beast, leading conservationists to conclude it had probably swallowed a plastic bag.

‘Leatherbacks feed primarily on jellyfish so it is very possible that plastics – such as bags that look like jellyfish – could be causing a gastro-intestinal issue,’ Mrs Thorvalson added.

Leatherbacks, the biggest of all the sea turtles, swim in six of the seven oceans, roaming up to 13,000 miles a year in their search for food and nesting sites. The leatherback turtle’s dark blue shell is leathery to the touch – giving it its name.

The animal is officially endangered, with global populations of nesting females having dropped from 115,000 in 1980 to as few as 34,000 in recent years.

Yawkey has responded well to antibiotics and other treatment, and the aquarium hopes to release it in the next few days.
