England boss Roy Hodgson has criticised Tottenham, claiming they should not be taking Harry Kane on a 21,000-mile post-season trek to Australia if they think he needs a rest.

Kane gushed with pride on Thursday after being rewarded for his fine form with a maiden England call-up.

The 21-year-old is in line to make his international debut against Lithuania on March 27 or in Italy four days later.

'It is an honour to be called up to the senior side, something I always dreamed of as a kid,' Kane told Spurs TV.

'I'm excited, when I got the message I was going to be in I was full of joy and hopefully it is the first of many.'

Having started the season as Spurs' third-choice striker, few expected Kane to score 26 goals for the club.

But now he is the club's poster boy and, for that reason, the north Londoners are determined to take him on their post-season jaunt to Australia, where they will play Sydney FC in a friendly on May 30.

Hodgson is not so keen on the idea, however.

Kane will, more than likely, be included in the England Under-21 squad for the European Championship - which takes place from June 17 to June 30 - as Hodgson wants him to experience international tournament football.

Gareth Southgate's team will play at least one friendly between the end of the season (May 24) and the start of the tournament on June 17.

Hodgson has noted Mauricio Pochettino's concerns about Kane's potential tiredness, but he thinks Spurs have a perfect opportunity to rest the striker by leaving him out of the squad for the 42-hour round trip to Australia.

'This is a marketing game as far as I can understand,' the England manager said.

'Personally speaking, playing for England at Under-21 level at a tournament is more important than a friendly in Australia.

'I would be very hypocritical if I didn't give that answer.

'If he needs a rest, there's a great opportunity when the season ends before our Under-21s get together to give him a rest.

'You can't expect me in good faith to say: 'oh no, I understand he shouldn't be resting for the Australia trip, he should be doing that and then resting when the Under-21s pitch up.' I can't go along with that.'

Having represented Spurs across four competitions, Kane could amass well over 50 appearances for the club before the end of the season.

And the Argentinian expects the forward to push himself to the extreme to impress Hodgson.

Pochettino will relay his concerns to Hodgson when England train at the club's Enfield base next week in the build-up to the two internationals.

'I will see Mauricio,' Hodgson said.

'I don't think it's a problem there. Don't forget these decisions are sometimes commercial and taken out of a coach's hands.'
