New York Jets head coach Rex Ryan has previously claimed to have eaten as many as 12 tacos in one sitting. These days, it's more like one.

The New York Jets coach and vocal diarrhetic has never hid that he underwent weight-loss surgery in March 2010. 

Normally happy to talk - and talk - about anything, Ryan was tight-lipped about the details of the procedure for more than two years.

Before and after: Rex Ryan knew he had to do something when he weighed in at 348 pounds in 2009, left. Ryan, pictured right in an interview this week, has lost more than 106 pounds

He wanted to reach the milestone of shedding 100 pounds before he opened his notorious mouth.

From a peak of 348 pounds, Ryan is now down to about 243 pounds, which is less than each of the players on his defensive line - and even quarterback Tim Tebow.

Even Jets fans sometimes don't recognize the new, slim Rex.

'I feel good because I know l look better than I did,' he said Thursday, before quickly adding in typical fashion, 'which is not saying much.'

On the sidelines: Ryan, who's been coaching the Jets since 2009, is perhaps known best for his verbal outbursts

Ryan added: 'But it wasn't about that for me. I've been married for 25 years. I wasn't looking for the young girlfriend or whoever. ... I wanted to be healthier and live a long, healthy life.'

At the height of his coaching career, he was also hitting a high on the scales, weighing in at 348 pounds just before the Jets faced the Indianapolis Colts in the 2009 AFC championship.

He said the number left him 'mortified,' and he even checked behind him to see if a fellow coach was playing a trick on him, putting additional pressure on the scale while he stood on it.

Couple: Ryan has been married to his wife Michelle since 1987. They have two children

Ryan said: 'There was nobody there. It was just me. I was shocked. I thought I was about 300 to maybe 310.'

He had tried all sorts of diets in the past, losing lots of weight only to gain it all back - and more. 

Ryan decided to have Lap-Band surgery after hearing the success stories of former players Jamie Dukes and Tony Siragusa.

The device makes him feel full after eating, say, that one taco, forcing him to practice portion control. 

Ryan acknowledged he didn't necessarily eat much healthier - just less.

'If I want pizza, instead of eating a whole pizza like I used to, I'll eat a slice of pizza, if even that,' he said.

The device can be adjusted, so Ryan had it loosened a bit when he and his wife recently went to Paris for their 25th anniversary so he could fully sample the French cuisine.

After the surgery, his weight loss had started to plateau when he started exercising, which melted away many more pounds. Ryan was at about 290 during last season.

At his heaviest, working out was just too hard on his joints. Now walking an hour on the treadmill feels like nothing, and he's thinking of running for the first time in two decades.

His goal is to drop another 20 pounds or so. Ryan has gone from a 48- to a 38-inch waist, so he's had to replace all his clothes except for his socks. His blood pressure and cholesterol have plummeted.

Without being asked, Ryan volunteers that he's getting paid to serve as a spokesman for Lap-Band.

Quarterbacks: As it has been for the last several months, the big story with the Jets this season is the team's recent high-profile acquisition - Tim Tebow - and starter Mark Sanchez

'My message is: Do I believe in it? There's no question, 100 per cent,' he said.

So much so that he convinced his twin brother, Cowboys defensive coordinator Rob Ryan, to get the surgery too. Rob has lost about 60 pounds.

Ryan's attitude often seemed inseparable from his girth, but he insists he's the same old Rex - just healthier. The Jets' full training camp opens in Cortland, New York, next Thursday.

As it has been for the last several months, the big story with the Jets this season is the team’s recent high-profile acquisition - Tim Tebow - and star quarterback Mark Sanchez.

Ryan repeated yet again that Sanchez would be his starting quarterback.
