The horrifying moment a 90-year-old man was struck by a motorist and left to die in a busy Los Angeles intersection has been caught on video.

Police have released the graphic surveillance footage, which shows Joo Yoon knocked off his bicycle and thrown into the road, in an effort to track down the driver who fled the scene moments after the fatal accident.

The disturbing tape, uploaded on YouTube by the LAPD, shows Yoon riding his bike in a marked crosswalk at the intersection of Virgil Avenue and 6th Street in Koreatown at around 5:10 a.m. on April 27.

Graphic: The horrifying moment a 90-year-old man was struck by a motorist and left to die in a busy Los Angeles intersection has been caught on video

As he's making his way across, he is fatally struck by a car driving with right of way through the intersection.

In a split-second, the victim is thrown up onto the hood of the car and then into the road as his bike is flung feet in the air.

The driver continues down the street where he briefly pulls over and has a conversation with a following car before both drivers speed away.

Other motorists finally stop and presumably call 911 as Yoon remains lifeless in the middle of the street.

Police said the victim was taken to the hospital, where he later died.

It is a crime for a driver involved in a crash not to remain at the crash site to render aid or to identify themselves.

Los Angeles police, having come up with no leads in the investigation so far, have released the graphic footage in the hope the public will help them identify the driver.

The suspect's car was described as a dark grey or gun-metal Nissan GT-R, with a 3-inch white racing stripe on both sides stretching from the front fender to the tail light.

Sad: Other cars continue to drive around the body through the intersection before help finally arrives

Police said the vehicle will likely have damage to the front bumper area and the hood, where it struck the elderly man.

The driver was described as an Asian man in his mid-20s with black hair and brown eyes. He was about 5 feet 9 inches tall and weighed about 190 pounds, they said.

Authorities are also hoping to speak to the driver of the second car, described as possibly a newer model Audi, which was black or dark in color.
