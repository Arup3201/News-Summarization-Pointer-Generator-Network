Three nurses have been arrested amid claims of serious neglect at the hospital where a patient died after being left in an ambulance for four hours last week.

They are accused of falsifying records to cover up poor care at the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend, south Wales.

The hospital is already at the centre of an investigation following the death of former miner Michael Bowen, 58 – who was forced to remain in a queuing ambulance.

And there are fears that problems are continuing at the hospital- where only last Thursday queues of up to 14 ambulances were seen outside its Accident and Emergency department.

The arrests came as campaigners demanded urgent action over mounting claims of ‘cruelty’ and ‘unnecessary suffering’ at the hospital. An independent review has now been ordered by the Welsh Government into the claims.

Last night a whistleblower said she had been ignored when she raised concerns about poor care – and that reports she filed about dangerous incidents went missing.

Former nurse Glenda Rodriguez-Noza said she saw a room being poorly cleaned, a dementia patient being roughly handled and a patient given the wrong medication.

‘I would fill out an incident form and later be told they had no record of it,’ she said.

‘I have kept copies of them so I have them.  An internal investigation found there was not enough evidence to support my claims and in the end it all became too stressful.

‘I want to speak out because I want these people to be held to account and to stop these mistakes happening again and again.’

Mrs Rodrigeuz-Noza, who worked at the Princess of Wales Hospital for eight years and left in 2009, is now involved in tribunal proceedings against the ABMU health board.

Patients have also made allegations about care at the hospital. One pensioner was left in the resuscitation room for almost three hours, while an elderly amputee died after she was left nil by mouth for two days.

Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University Health Board, which runs the hospital, said: ‘We apologise sincerely to the patients and families who we have let down at the Princess of Wales Hospital.

‘In May 2013 we invited an external team, Advancing Quality Alliance (AQuA), to review quality and safety at the Princess of Wales Hospital. 

‘This was in response to serious complaints about care provided to some patients; critical Ombudsman’s reports; mortality rates, and a police investigation into allegations of falsification of records by some of our nurses.

AQuA’s recommendations will be presented to our Board shortly, backed by an action plan.’
