Former Premier League footballer Gary Neville has been given the green light to build his controversial 'Teletubby' home - almost three years after plans were first unveiled.

The Sky Sports pundit, who ditched earlier plans to power the 'carbon neutral' home with a wind turbine, was yesterday given permission to build the house in the heart of rural Lancashire by Bolton council’s planning committee.

Councillor Andy Morgan, one of the committee members, said the application was innovative and that it was one of the only plans he had seen that was 'code 6' - the highest available score on a government energy rating system.

Mr Morgan said: 'The turbine was the main issue for residents and it’s now gone.

I believe the exceptional circumstances have been met because of code six and it is still an attractive and modern building.

'It’s not too obtrusive for residents and it’s a build which absolutely protects the environment.

'I think as a committee we should support this application.'

Laa Laa Land: The innovative design is intended to have minimal impact on views of the Lancashire hills and has been likened to a Neolithic settlement

Proposals to include a 100-foot wind turbine were dropped by the former Manchester United player when developers came up with even 'greener' ways to power the house - which will be the first carbon-neutral house in Bolton and in the North West.

It will include a ground source heat pump, sustainable rainwater harvesting and photovoltaic cells, which convert light into electricity.

Mike Ralph, representing Neville, told the meeting: 'The first application generated over 100 objections, so before this new application we were careful to make sure with local residents, the plans take them into consideration.

'There have been a few obstacles along the way, but the latest application only received two objections.

'There have been numerous people say to us they are grateful he has gone away and given a more thoughtful application.

'It will be smaller than before and will only take four to five months to build rather than the original 18 to 20 months.'

The amount of land the five-bedroom home will take up has been also been reduced, because it will be built over two floors instead of just one storey.

Much of the construction will take place off-site, reducing the time it will take to build the house and the potential noise and disturbance to neighbours.
