Paul Pogba impressed team-mates in Qatar after scoring in training from behind the goal.

The Juventus midfielder nonchalantly curled the ball into an empty net while standing behind the goal line next to the corner flag.

Massimo Allegri's side are in the country for their Italian Super Cup clash with last season's Coppa Italia winners Napoli.

Juventus have won the cup in each of the last three seasons.  Success on Monday will mean they have won the competition a record seven times.

Napoli's only Super Cup success came in 1990 when they beat the Turin giants 5-1, although they may struggle to replicate that result without Diego Maradonna among their ranks. 

But captain Marik Hamsik was confident they could could get the result. 

He said: We know how to hurt them. If we play with the same intensity we displayed against Roma (when they won 2-0) we have a good chance to beat them. We usually don't fail in these kind of matches.'
