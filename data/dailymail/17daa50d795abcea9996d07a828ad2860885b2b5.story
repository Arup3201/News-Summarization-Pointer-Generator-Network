Labour has been accused of embarking on '1970s class war' with attacks on private education by one of the country's leading private school headteachers.

Alun Jones, principal of St Gabriel's in Newbury, argued that referring to independent schools as bastions of 'elite and privilege' is outdated.

And he claimed some parents pay far more by moving house or hiring private tutors to keep their children in state schools.

Mr Jones is the new president of the Girls' Schools Association (GSA), and the first man to be appointed to the post. 

Speaking before taking up the role, he warned against 'outdated' perceptions of private schooling. 

Labour's education spokesman Tristram Hunt was accused of launching a class war  last month after he warned public schools they must do more to work with state schools or lose tax breaks worth £70million by 2020.

He faced a furious backlash for turning education into a 'class issue', with even the headteacher at his old school condemning his 'offensive bigotry'.

Mr Hunt, 40, attended University College School in Hampstead, north London, where a place costs £17,835-a-year. He went on to study history at Trinity College, Cambridge and the University of Chicago.

His father, Lord Hunt of Chesterton, went to fee-paying Westminster School and is a former chief executive of the Met Office who was given a seat in the Lords by Tony Blair.

Critics accused Mr Hunt of trying to make it harder for others to have the choice that he and his parents had. 

Mr Jones insisted that it is time to banish 'stereotypical, out-of-date' references to the independent sector.

'It's going back to the old 1970s class war, it's so outdated, the reference to the independent sector as that type of elite and privilege.'

He added: 'My school, like many, many other GSA schools, are real world schools where mum and dad are working very hard to prioritise their income to benefit their children.

'And it's funny, I would say 80 per cent of the social apartheid one sees in schools at the moment is actually because of geography, and some parents can access incredible education and incredibly successful schools because they can afford incredibly expensive housing in expensive areas of the country.'

There is a question over what is the greatest privilege - paying school fees or moving into an expensive area, Mr Jones said.

'Some parents will actually prioritise their household income in order to make significant sacrifices to send their children to independent school, other parents will choose to look at geographical locations of where to buy and will be able to afford incredibly expensive housing in what they consider to be a far better school area.

'They supplement this with tutors and extra lessons in all sorts of other activities.'

This does mean that some state schools 'can end up being more exclusive than many independent schools', Mr Jones said. 

But Mr Hunt rejected the claims. 'There is more to be done to share facilities, insights and expertise between the state and private sectors. We would not be setting up any new quangos,' he told The Guadrian.

'We will ask the independent schools inspectorate to ensure that exactly the type of successful partnership St Gabriel's has developed is emulated across the sector.'
