Bacary Sagna has revealed that he left Arsenal in order to 'challenge' himself at  Manchester City - and says he shares the 'frustration' Gunners fans feel towards the club's transfer strategy.

The France full-back controversially switched the Emirates for the Etihad this summer on a free transfer after seven seasons in North London.

There have been some question marks as to why Sagna, who has made just one appearance this season so far for the Premier League champions, would give up guaranteed first-team football at Arsenal to become part of a huge squad at City.

But the 31-year-old, quoted in French newspaper L'Equipe, said: 'It was a good time for me to see something new, to boost my career.

'I have made ​​much progress at Arsenal alongside my teammates and Arsene Wenger. I thought long and hard and it was a difficult choice, mentally.

'At City, the squad is much bigger. But that's what I was looking for, I needed to challenge myself.

'Arsenal is and will remain a quality team. I understand the fans are frustrated when they see the transfers at other clubs.' 

Arsenal tied up the deadline-day signing of Danny Welbeck from Manchester United for £16million but did not strengthen at the back.
