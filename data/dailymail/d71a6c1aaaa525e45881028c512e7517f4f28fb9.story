A Florida restaurant hopes to identify the man who wrongly accepted $1,000 in lost money from a waitress earlier this week.

Samantha Knight was waitressing at Laishley Crab House in Punta Gorda on Tuesday when she found a wad of $100 dollar bills on the seat at one of her tables, and ran to the front of the restaurant to return the money before the patron left. 

Security footage shows the moment the waitress catches the customer just as he's walking out the door. 

'I was like you left this in the booth. He said thanks, patted his pocket, took it and walked away,' Ms Knight told WBBH.

Take the money and run: Surveillance footage at Laishley Crab House shows a waitress handing over $1,000 in lost cash she believed belonged to the man leaving on the right

Mix-up: Waitress Samantha Knight says she thought she was returning it to the right customer, and he acted like the lost money was his

The mix-up happened last Tuesday at Laishley Crab House in Punta Gorda, Florida

It was only after the man left that the waitress realized she mixed up tables, and handed the money to the wrong customer.

The man who actually dropped the money, Chuck Behm, was filmed leaving the restaurant just one minute prior and is now already back home in Chicago, Illinois.

The restaurant would have been able to track the customer if he paid his bill with a card, but he paid in cash leaving no identity behind.

There's that money I forgot: The man is filmed taking a mint from the restaurant's front desk on his way out when Ms Knight stops him and hands him the money. He easily accepts the wad of $100 dollar bills

Left too soon: The man the money actually belonged to, Charles Behm, was filmed leaving the restaurant just one minute before Ms Knight ran to catch the customer

Now they're hoping that someone will see the surveillance footage and step forward to identify the man who wrongly took the money.

'I feel really bad,' Ms Knight said. 'I wish I had just held on to it and waited for someone to call. But I thought I was giving it to the right guy.'

Ms Knight says she was surprised that the customer took the money, saying he was an older person who should have know better.

Mr Behm agrees with his waitress, and doesn't blame her at all for the mix up.

'I felt awful. I still feel madder than anything at that guy,' he told WBBH from Chicago.

He says if the money is returned, he plans to give it all to Ms Knight, who is currently several months pregnant. 

What a tip! If the money is returned, Mr Behm plans to give it all to Ms Knight, who is currently expecting a baby
