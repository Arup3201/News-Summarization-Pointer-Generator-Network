A mystery cat-like creature has been filmed stalking the streets of Los Angeles at night, prompting fears an African lion may be on the loose.

Grainy security camera footage taken by a City of Norwalk resident shows the unidentified beast wandering past houses and parked cars under the cover of darkness on July 29.

At first glance the creature, which ambles slowly and calmly past the security camera, appears to be an African lioness or mountain lion.

Experts have struggled to agree on what it is, suggesting it's an African lion, a mountain lion or even a big dog

City police and sheriff patrols have been increased in the area in order to reduce residents' safety concerns

But speculation over what animal it could be is now rife, with claims and counter claims being made by a variety of officials and experts.

They have suggested it is - among other things - a mountain lion, an African lion, some type of hybrid dog, a leopard or a large domestic cat. Some have even speculated it could be the mythical Chupacabra.

There have been no further sightings of the creature since the video was recorded and City of Norwalk officials said it was not believed to be a hoax.

While the Department of Fish and Wildlife has ruled out the possibility the creature is a mountain lion, it has admitted it still can't definitively identify it.

The creature was filmed walking across a driveway on Tina Street (pictured), in the City of Norwalk, LA

Meanwhile, police patrols have been increased in the area and residents are being educated on what to do if they spot it.

Craig Packer, a professor at the University of Minnesota Lion Research Centre, told The LA Times: 'Yes, it certainly does look like an African lion. Itâ€™s not a cougar.'

But a Department of Fish and Wildlife game warden then told the paper he believed it was a large older dog, 'maybe a pit bull or part pit bull'.
