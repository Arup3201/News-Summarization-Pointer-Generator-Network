It's never too late to get fit says Britain's oldest female Ironman, who is still competitively swimming, cycling and running at the age of 71.

Grandmother Eddie Brocklesby, who lives in Vauxhall, London, has taken part in four Ironman events and is currently planning to do another in Lanzarote next year.

The Bristol-born retired social worker only started running when she turned 50 and has since completed physical challenges that people half her age would struggle to manage.

Impressive: Eddie Brocklesby, now 71, has completed four Ironman events since 2009 and is training for another next year

Eddie told MailOnline that exercise has become an essential part of her life, benefitting both her body and her mind.

She said: 'It's never too late to get into physical activity. You can swim whatever your age. Strength training you can do at home and build up quickly. 

'It can make such a difference as you age - you will be less likely to have a fall and you can be more independent and need less support.'

She added: 'It's good for both physical and mental health. I'm often told I don't look 71 or people tell me: "I wish my mum and dad did that". I'm toned and in good general health.'

Eddie was advised by her doctor to start exercising in her fifties when she started to go through the menopause. Women in this phase of life are more at risk of osteoporosis due to the hormonal changes in their bodies making their bones weaker.

Physical activity - in particularly weight training - is one of the best ways for women to increase their bone density and keep their bodies strong.

Eddie took up running and strength training for this reason and entered the Nottingham Half Marathon to keep her motivated.

She joked she also had another incentive: 'My husband said I would never be able to run a half marathon so I had to prove him wrong!'

After that she went on to run the London Marathon four times, achieving an impressive time of three hours and 56 minutes.

However, her running training was then curtailed after she sustained a knee injury when skiing.

'I knew I couldn't keep pounding the pavements so I took up triathlon,' she explained.

She was inspired by her sons, who had entered a triathlon, and they took part in the event together.

'It's great to do something like that with my family, even if they beat me!' she said.

She hopes her example shows her three children and four grandchildren that it is possible to stay in shape as you age.

'My grandchildren call me Mad Granny,' she joked, 'But I hope I am inspiring to them by showing them that you can keep exercising as you get older.'

After successfully completing a number of triathlons and duathlons, Eddie then took on her biggest challenge of all - the Ironman - for the first time at the age of 66.

The event involves a 2.4 mile swim, followed by a 112 mile bike ride, rounded off with a marathon run (26.2 miles).

Ambassador for a good cause: Eddie has been asked to front a campaign for Remember A Charity Week

Many who line up to take part in the events each year fail to finish. But Eddie made it round in under 16 hours and qualified in her age group for a coveted place in the Ironman World Champs - held in Hawaii every year.

She's now planning to do the Lanzarote Ironman again in 2015. 

Due to her knee problems, she keeps her running to a minimum - averaging around 12 miles a week - swims occasionally and cycles regularly doing long rides, spinning classes and getting on her bike to travel around London. She also does regular strength training exercises such as balancing on one leg.

As well improving her health and fitness, training for the event has enhanced her social life.

She trains with London-based Serpentine Running Club, where she has made many friends.

'Running clubs are accommodating of all abilities and ages. You don't need to be good to join and you get fit as well as enjoying the social side. I have made many friends of all ages at my running club. You have that common interest,' she said.

Taking part in races has also given her the opportunity to raise money for charity. 

As she has been such a staunch supporter of good causes through her career and sporting achievements, she has now been named a 'Living Legend' as part of Remember A Charity Week.

Thanks to her sporting achievements, Eddie has been named a 'Living Legend' for Remember A Charity Week

The week, which began on Monday and runs until 14th September, aims to inspire the nation to think about leaving a charitable gift in their Will. 

Eddie said: 'It was a privilege to be asked to help promote Remember A Charity Week and I enjoyed filming a video for the campaign in my local park. 

'Taking on a challenge, however small, is a good way to raise money for charity but people can also leave money to charities in their Wills.'
