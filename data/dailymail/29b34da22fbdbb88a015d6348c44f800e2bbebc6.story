The 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia, kicked off on Friday with the most expensively assembled opening ceremony in the history of the Winter Games.

And it seems the 22nd installment, which started in spectacular fashion, has attracted a high calibre of Royals supporting their national sportspeople.

In attendance today are Princess Anne, Prince Albert II and former Olympic swimmer Princess Charlene of Monaco, as well as Dutch royals King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands.

Looking quite the matched-up couple, Prince Albert II and Princess Charlene - a former Olympian herself - wore similar white jackets, gloves and stylish black sunglasses.

The Monaco Royals cheered on as their Arnaud Alessandria of Monaco competed during the Alpine Skiing Men's Downhill at Rosa Khutor Alpine Center today.

They chatted with the skier, who came 39th, after the race, as well as Norway's Aksel Lund Svindal, who came fourth.

The couple posed for pictures with Svindal, who appeared happy with his score.

5000m Speed Skating event at the Adler Arena Centre yesterday.

Sven Kramer, 27, from the Netherlands competed during the race on day one of the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics.

The
 couple watched, clapped and cheered from the sidelines for Kramer, who 
beat his own record to swoop gold in just 6 min 10.76 secs.

The Dutch Royals were pictured smiling as they took a bike ride tour around the Olympic Village in Sochi yesterday.

Dressed in smart business attire, the couple paired their outfits with official bright orange accessories, which were also 
the same shade as their bicycles.

They also attended the opening 
ceremony on Friday along with other world leaders.

On Thursday, Princess Anne visited the
 Olympic Park ahead of the Games. She was pictured chatting with pole 
vaulter and Mayor of the Olympic
 Village, Russia's Yelena Isinbayeva.

Present - but not looking amused - she opened up a good book and started reading 
in the middle of the opening ceremony on Friday. Also in attendance were dozens of world 
leaders, but Barack Obama, Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister 
David Cameron were all notably absent.

Yesterday,
 Princess Anne attended the Men's Biathlon 10km Sprint at the Laura 
Cross-Country Ski and Biathlon Center, accompanied by Admiral Laurence.

She wore a cosy Team GB hat and her trusy red, white and blue adidas jacket.

Today Britain celebrates its first ever medal on the snow.

Former chalet girl Jenny Jones made 
history in the newest of Olympic sports by claiming the snowboard 
slopestyle bronze medal.

The 33-year-old, from Bristol,
 managed what no Britain had achieved in 90 years of Winter Olympics 
going back to the Chamonix Games of 1924 - winning a medal on snow.

She
 had to endure an agonising 20-minute wait after finishing her second 
and final run while 10 of her rivals took to the slopes in their 
attempts to beat her score.

An estimated 2,500 athletes from 88 
nations will compete in 98 events across 15 disciplines, from Alpine 
skiing to biathlon and from snowboarding to speed skating.
