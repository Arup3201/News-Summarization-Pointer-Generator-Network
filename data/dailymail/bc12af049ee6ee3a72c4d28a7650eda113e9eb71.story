His girlfriend Maria Sharapova keeps getting into trouble for breaking Wimbledon’s strict dress code.

But there were no such complaints about Grigor Dimitrov’s appearance yesterday – particularly when he lifted up his T-shirt to reveal his rippling muscles.

In a practice game at the Boodles tennis competition in Buckinghamshire, members of St George’s Hill Ladies’ Lawn Tennis Club were all smiles as the 6ft 2in Bulgarian showed off his six-pack.

Love all: Grigor Dimitrov proved very popular with members of a ladies' tennis club in Buckinghamshire

The 22-year-old, ranked 31st in the world, was spotted cannoodling with his Russian girlfriend in Madrid last month and their romance appears to be blossoming.

As Dimitrov competed at the Aegon championship at The Queen’s Club in west London last week, Miss Sharapova was in the crowd cheering him on.

Famed for her deafening shrieks during matches, the 26-year-old proved she is just as vocal as a spectator.

But while her boyfriend’s appearance was
attracting all the right sort of attention, Miss Sharapova fell foul of
Wimbledon’s clothing rules for the second time since becoming a member 
of the All England Club in 2004.

In a practice session to prepare for the
grand slam tournament, which begins next Monday, she flouted the 
‘predominantly white’ players’ dress code.

And it seems no one can get away with coloured sportswear at Wimbledon – not even the world number two.

A spokesman said: ‘The “predominantly white” rule is a club rule 52 weeks of the year – there’s not a change for the competition.’

Miss Sharapova was ticked off for the same breach of rules before when she turned up to practise at the club during last summer’s Olympics.
