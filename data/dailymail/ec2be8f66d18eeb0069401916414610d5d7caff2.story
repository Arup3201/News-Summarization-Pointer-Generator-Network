A millionaire property developer and his wife, who say they were ruined because of a simple banking error, have lost their High Court claim for more than £3milion in damages.

Michael and Carol Ann Gatt are now faced with a £1million legal bill after they were left living in a bungalow on a building site near their former home - £4million Melksham Court, a Cotswold country estate once sought after by the actor Hugh Grant.

The couple, both 66, claimed Barclays wrongly told credit reference agencies Mr Gatt was over his agreed overdraft limit, ruining his credit rating and killing their business.

Judge Patrick Moloney QC rejected claims of negligence, breach of contract and defamation and said the couple probably would have lost their assets in the credit crunch anyway.

The Gatts had ‘borrowed beyond their means’ and their business would have been unlikely to survive the crash in the property market, he said.

Speaking after the judgment was handed down, Mrs Gatt told Judge Moloney: ‘It is an absolute mockery, I have £30 in my bank account’.

The judge, who heard the High Court trial last year, said the Gatts had been successful property developers who ‘lived the lifestyle of prosperous, indeed wealthy, people’.

They sold their £2million home in Kent in 2004 and moved to Melksham Court, a medieval manor house with substantial grounds and outlying cottages.

There, they had space for Mrs Gatt's stable of quarter horses, a £240,000 mobile home, as well as Mr Gatt's Ferrari and collection of Harley-Davidson motorcycles.

The judge continued: ‘Plainly, they were not afraid of borrowing, as some people are, but regarded being overdrawn for business and living purposes as a normal condition, confident of being able to repay when their ship came in.'

Disaster struck for the couple in April 2008 when they were refused remortgage finance by RBS on their home, which they needed to plough into development projects.

They soon learned that Barclays had provided reports to credit reference agencies stating that Mr Gatt's account was ‘delinquent’, since it was £260,000 overdrawn when the agreed limit was only £1,500.

Lack of finance resulted in the collapse of development projects and their GLN Holdings Ltd business, the repossession of Melksham Court and Mr Gatt's eventual bankruptcy.

Unable to fund anywhere else to live, they moved into a bungalow, owned by their son, on the boundary of the historic Melksham Court estate, in Stinchcombe, near Dursley.

The bungalow was part of a development property and so the couple, who had once lived in the nine-bed stately home, were left living a stone's throw away, surrounded by building works.

They sued on the basis that, although Mr Gatt was indeed £260,000 overdrawn, it was with the permission of the bank and should not have led to adverse credit reports.

Claims: The couple claimed Barclays wrongly told credit reference agencies Mr Gatt was over his agreed overdraft limit

Giving his judgment today, Judge Moloney said that, on the evidence before him, the bank was correct in saying that the account was well overdrawn.

The higher limit had been sanctioned to provide funds in February 2007, but for four months only, after which it reverted to the £1,500 limit.

The information disclosed by the bank to the credit agencies was with Mr Gatt's contractual consent and was ‘true and not misleading’, he said.

‘It is more probable that, like so many others, the Gatts, who had prospered on the rising market but had spent their profits and continued borrowing beyond their means, would not have been able to survive the falling market even if these credit reports had not been published, and even if they had continued to speculate with more borrowed money into 2009.

‘In short, they would probably have lost their net assets, which were in fact very few, in any event.’

The judge allowed a counterclaim by the bank for the repayment by Mrs Gatt of £847,287 in outstanding loans and overdrafts, as well as £80,000 in costs.

Mr Gatt had originally been a claimant in the case, but his claim was bought by the bank from his trustee in bankruptcy and discontinued. He was in court alongside his wife throughout.
