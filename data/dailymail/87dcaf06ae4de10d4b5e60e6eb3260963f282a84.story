Savers have been given a vital boost with a series of radical reforms – including the creation of a ‘super Isa’ and introduction of lucrative tax breaks.

From July 1, everyone can put up to £15,000 into a new, simpler type of tax-free savings account which will allow savers to put away almost three times more than they can currently in a cash Isa.

In the new account, they will be able to move their money easily between the stockmarket and regular high street deals in a bid to get the best possible return from their nest eggs.

The Treasury has called these New Individual Savings Accounts, or Nisas – but yesterday they were already being dubbed the super Isa because of the lucrative perks they bring.

It marks a major victory for Money Mail’s Get Britain Saving campaign, which called for one Isa allowance which allows savers to move freely between cash and shares.

On top of this, the Chancellor declared 
that around 1.5million with small incomes that are boosted by money they
 have in a savings account will get a £1,000 tax break on their 
interest.

Peter and Karen Walker  (pictured with twin daughters Lucy and Sophie) were delighted with the Chancellor’s decision to raise the annual Isa allowance to £15,000.

Mrs Walker, 48, shops around for the best Isa interest rates and then uses the full allowance each year whenever she can.

After overcoming cancer in 2001, Mrs Walker likes to save money for family holidays so she can spend quality time with her daughters.

Mrs Walker said: ‘I put anything we have to spare into savings. Now that the limit has been raised we will take advantage of that and save the full £15,000 so long as we can find a good interest rate.

‘Family holidays are really important to us. We’ll be taking the girls to Disneyworld in Florida over Easter which will be wonderful.’

Mrs Walker works as an IT project manager earning £41,768, and her husband earns £48,400 as a transport manager.

They have two cash Isas at present – a Nationwide Isa with a 2.5 per cent interest rate and £5,760 in the account, and a Post Office Isa with a 2.51 per cent rate holding £3,000.

As well as saving, their priority is to pay off the mortgage on their £400,000. three-bed home in Swindon.

The announcements were described as a lifeline for the savings classes who have been hard hit during the recovery from the financial crisis.

The prudent have seen their incomes slashed since the Bank of England reduced base rate to a historic low of 0.5 per cent in March 2009.

Rates on high street accounts were cut further when the Government’s Funding for Lending Scheme was introduced in summer 2012. This gave the banks a cheap source of funds, and meant they no longer needed money from savers.

Campaigner group Save Our Savers estimates savers have lost as much as £117billion in interest since the financial crisis began.

Anna Bowes, director of website Savings Champion, said: ‘The prudent have been bearing the brunt of the financial meltdown, and have been for some time now.

‘Allowing people to put more into an account and giving them flexibility to move their money in and out of the stockmarket is a huge boost.

This really is the most radical transformation of the way we save for decades.’

Since Isas were first introduced 15 years ago they have proved wildly popular because of the tax breaks, as you do not pay any tax on the interest or the profits you make.

By the end of 2013, £443billion was held in these accounts, with just under half of this in cash.

Under current rules taxpayers can put a maximum of £11,520 into an Isa every tax year.

The entirety of this allowance can be put into stocks and shares, but a maximum of half – £5,760 – can be put away in cash.

Savers can move money from existing cash Isa accounts into stocks and shares, but cannot transfer the other way.

This means that those approaching retirement who want to protect their savings by moving them out of the stockmarket are not allowed to do so.

But with the new super Isa, savers will get one allowance of £15,000 every tax year. It will be up to them how much they want to put into each type, and they will be allowed to move between shares and cash when they like.

To further boost their popularity the Treasury announced that peer-to-peer lending – through so-called lend-to-save websites – would also be allowed to be held in an Isa. With these sites a saver effectively lends out their cash directly to borrowers, cutting out the bank in the middle.

And in one final helping hand that will help around 1.5million savers the Chancellor also declared that those on small income should no longer have to pay tax on the first £5,000 of savings interest they make – effectively handing them a £1,000 tax break.

Around 189,000 will be taken out of paying any tax altogether.

Currently, poorer savers get a £279 tax break as they are given a 10p rate on the first £2,790 of interest they earn.
