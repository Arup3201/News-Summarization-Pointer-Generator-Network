A Canadian teenager who tweeted about planning to commit suicide has been helped by concerned internet users from all over the world - potentially saving her life.

The girl, who has not been identified, posted a message to her Twitter account on Saturday night reading: 'I'm gonna attempt suicide tonight. Bye everyone.'

The message was read by people from all over the world - including Christopher Wiggins, a journalist 2,000 miles away from the Calgary teenager in Washington D.C.

Concerns: A Calgary teen tweeted this message on Saturday night - sparking Twitter users into action

'I happen to sympathize with people with depression because I've struggled with that kind of feeling myself,' he told WUSA9 after reading the message.

'There's nothing I can do that would make the situation worse other than to ignore it.'

While he said he could not be certain that the tweet was real, he said he could not just leave it. He looked back through the girl's earlier messages and saw many indicating she was unhappy.

So he stayed up throughout the night speaking to the girl, who lists her age as 17 on her Twitter page, after contacting her online.

Fears: Christopher Wiggins, from Washington, D.C., was among the concerned Twitter users who read the message and contacted the girl before alerting the Calgary Police

Swift action: The Calgary Police said they received concerned calls from across North America

'I began writing her with the simple question, "Are you okay?",' Wiggins told CTV. 'And I tried to engage her in a conversation and gain her trust to the point that I said, "If you need to talk, hereâ€™s my cell phone number".

'I said, "The police are trying to look for you, you know they're worried, a lot of people are worried about you".'

As he provided her support, he also urged her to pass over her number, and when she did, he alerted Calgary Police to ask for help.

Other people also responded to the tweet 
on her account, asking her to contact them or to call for help. Others 
provided updates to the situation by saying that the Calgary police had 
been alerted.

Help: Wiggins said he believes the action of the Twitter community helped to save a life (file picture)

Officers told WUSA9 that Wiggins was not the only one to contact them, and that they had received alerts from people across North America.

They would not provide many details about the case, citing confidentiality, but they did say that they had checked on the teenager and that she was well.

'In this case, Twitter saved someone's life period,' Wiggins said. 'Twitter allowed the police, the public and the media to work together and confirm...someone in need.'
