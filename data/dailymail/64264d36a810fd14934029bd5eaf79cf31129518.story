With mock Tudor buildings, cobbled streets, red telephone boxes and a Gothic church, it could be a quaint English town.

But don't be deceived - this bizarre settlement is actually some 5,700 miles away in China.

And unlike most places in the UK, its population is shrinking. 'Thames Town', about 19 miles from central Shanghai, is virtually a ghost town.

The extraordinary settlement opened in 2006 as a replica of a small town in the UK.

Traditional buildings were copied and pubs and shops were imitated in an attempt to recreate the British way of life.

Developers even fashioned a artificial river to replicate the Thames.

At the time James Ho, the head of one of the companies behind the development, Shanghai Hengde Real Estate, said: 'I wanted the properties to look exactly the same as those in the United Kingdom.

'I think English properties are very special.

'When we decide to learn from others, we should not make any improvements or changes.'

However, a development which was designed to house about 10,000 people has not proved as popular as hoped.

Reports claim only a 'handful' of people live there, but the place does attract tourists wishing to take pictures of its English-style architecture.

Thames Town isn't the only place in China to have landmarks copied from the UK.

Last
month Mail Online revealed how an almost identical version of London's 
Tower Bridge has been built in Suzhou, a city in the eastern province of
Jiangsu.

A replica Alpine village has also been built in the southern Chinese city of Huizhou.

The village, complete with artificial lake, is a copy of Hallstatt in Austria.

Contrast: The quaint surroundings of Thames Town could hardly be more different to the bustling environment of Shanghai city centre

Worlds apart: Thames Town is only located about 19 miles from the centre of Shanghai, but the two places are very different
