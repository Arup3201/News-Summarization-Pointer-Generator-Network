An Atlanta woman who lost her husband in a horrific car accident in 2011 embraced the driver who was responsible for it on Thursday.

Tamara Matthews pleaded guilty in court today to causing the accident that killed Sandra Walker's husband Glen Walker - and Matthews' own son, Joshua Jenkins, 16.

After Matthews was sentenced to 36 months probation and 500 hours of community service, Walker's widow, who suffered a life-altering brain injury in the crash, hugged her.

'I know she is going through as much pain as I am feeling. I wanted her to know that I forgive her for what she did,' Sandra Walker, 32, told WSB-TV.

Police said the crash happened when Matthews drove her black minivan across the center line into the Walker family's white minivan on November 5, 2011 on Flat Shoals Road in Fulton County.

The car, driven by Glen Walker with his wife and their two children as passengers, flipped over.

Walker died from his injuries weeks after the crash.

Sandra Walker, a kindergarten teacher in Gwinnett County, suffered a traumatic brain injury.

'Glen took the brunt of the impact and paid with his life,' said walker's sister Michelle Walker told CBS-46 in 2011.

Matthews' son, Joshua Jenkins, died at the scene.

During her victim impact statement, Walker cried and told Matthews she forgives her for the crash that took the life of her husband.

'Ms Matthews and I have a lot more in common than is showing on the surface. But the one thing that is obvious is that we both suffered great loss,' Walker told the court.

She spoke about her husband and their deep love and devotion, and how his loss affected not just her, but many, many others.

'He wasn't just my husband; this isn't just about me. Others are mourning his loss as well: his mother and father are still waiting for him to return and walk through their door. His brother and cousin have lost their person, their mentor and friend who was always there to give them guidance and advice. Friends, family and coworkers whose lives have forever been changed.

'At 35 years old, over 600 people attended his funeral. He was a difference-maker in people's lives,' she said.

She said her traumatic brain injury completely changed her life. She had to re-learn how to walk, shower, drive and take care of herself and her two young children.

'And live both without my life partner and with a disability that has left me unable to return to work or live independently,' she said.

She said her brain injury took away not only her memories of the accident but her memory of the last interactions she had with her husband.

Nevertheless, Walker said she never wanted jail time for the woman responsible for her husband's death, who also lost her own beloved son.

'I have no anger or angst towards you.'Â
