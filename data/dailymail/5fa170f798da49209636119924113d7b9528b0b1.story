A five-year-old Illinois boy with leukemia turned into Godzilla last week.

Maddex turned into 'Madzilla' and starred in a mini-movie of the same name through the help of the Make-a-Wish Foundation, the Chicago Tribune reported.

He lives with acute lymphoblastic 
leukemia and loves Godzilla, the newspaper said - and so much that he receives Godzilla toys from his parents after spinal taps.

Maddex also reportedly undergoes chemotherapy, the paper said.

Director Jonathan Becker and Chicago-based producer Mo Wagdy, along with 'an outpouring of support from the Chicago film community,' made a five-minute monster movie starring Maddex, the Tribune said.

Mayor Rahm Emanuel was included in the creature feature, ABC7Chicago reported.Â 

'I'm a Chicago cab driver when the 
monster comes around about to eat the cab and part of the city, and I 
run away,' Emanuel told ABC7Chicago.

The movie will show 'Maddex [struggling] to convince adults that he is not a young boy but in fact a scaly, fire-breathing monster,' the Tribune said.

Photos from the mini-movie's production 
show Maddex dressed as Godzilla as he tramples a mini Grant Park with 
the Willis Tower in the background.

Another on-set snap shows Emanuel 
apparently consulting with Maddex.

The cost of Maddex's monstrous wish has not been released.

'Maddex and his family were out on LaSalle Street with around 100 volunteers and extras who showed up to pretend like they were running away from an 800-foot lizard that was stomping through downtown Chicago,' Saturday, Ryan Blackburn of Make-a-Wish Illinois told ABC News.

Speaking about the film's production, Maddex's father Tony told the Tribune 'It was definitely the happiest we've ever seen him.'
