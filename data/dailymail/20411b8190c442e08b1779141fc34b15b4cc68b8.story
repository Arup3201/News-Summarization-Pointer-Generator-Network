A Conservative MP has been dragged into a long-running legal dispute between one of her supporters and the founder of Fathers 4 Justice, The Mail on Sunday can reveal.

Caroline Nokes, MP for Romsey and Southampton North, has received a summons to appear at the High Court on Friday along with former Tory lobbyist Adrian Yalland, who is accused of harassment and assault in a civil claim.

In the claim being brought by Matt O’Connor, who founded the father’s rights campaign group, and his wife Nadine, Mr Yalland is accused of assault, causing injury, unlawful trespass, breach of privacy, stalking and harassment.

But it also names Miss Nokes as a defendant and suggests that she aided and abetted Mr Yalland.

The O’Connors are seeking an injunction and compensation against the defendants.

Miss Nokes and Mr Yalland last night said they would both be defending the claim, which follows an incident where Mr Yalland was held on suspicion of assault after apparently biting Matt O’Connor and his landlord in Stockbridge, Hampshire, on February 20, 2014.

Mr Yalland, who was never charged with any offence, claimed he was trying to serve Mr O’Connor with a libel claim when the incident happened.

Court papers allege that Miss Nokes drove Mr Yalland to the O’Connors’ house, which she denies.

Mr Yalland appears to have had a long-running dispute with the O’Connors. 

He claims he has previously sued the Fathers 4 Justice campaign director for defamation. 

On the day of the incident, Mr Yalland attempted to take a photograph as proof he had served his own legal papers.

In an altercation that allegedly followed, Mr O’Connor said he was punched by Mr Yalland before he and the landlord were bitten.

But Mr Yalland alleged the two men tried to snatch his mobile phone and said he only reacted proportionately in self-defence after being punched and pinned down.

The case was dropped with police telling Mr Yalland he would face no further action.

Mr Yalland described the latest allegations as ‘crazy… gross distortions or inventions’.

He added: ‘I am sure the Court will conclude the same on Friday.’ 

Miss Nokes said last night: ‘I will be defending the claim, but I am not sure what I can do to prove a negative. 

'I simply am not harassing them, and they will be unable to prove I am.’
