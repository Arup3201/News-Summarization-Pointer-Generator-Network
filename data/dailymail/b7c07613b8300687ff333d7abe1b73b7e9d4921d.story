A horrifying video has revealed the brutal, state-condoned treatment of a mentally ill inmate at one California prison where guards douse the man in pepper spray, leaving him screaming in pain and begging for it to stop.

The tape was released on Thursday by a federal judge as part of a lawsuit brought on behalf of 30,000 prisoners seeking a ban on the practice. 

Pepper-spraying is an official method at California State Prison in Corcoran to remove troubled prisoners from their cells after all other tactics fail. 

WARNING: DISTRESSING VIDEO CONTENT

A naked and screaming prisoner is pinned down by six guards in gas masks at Corcoran Prison in California last July after he was pepper-sprayed to get him out of his cell

In one tape from July 2012, a screaming, naked prisoner is doused in pepper spray five times in the 30 minutes that it takes six guards, wearing hazard suits, gas masks and helmets to pin him down and strap him to a gurney.

Throughout the ordeal, the prisoner appears highly distressed and in pain, screaming: 'Somebody help me'; 'You're choking me' and 'I can't breathe'.

He can be heard retching along with prison guards who also cough from the volume of pepper spray used.

The inmate, whom was deemed psychotic by his prison psychiatrist and in need of emergency medication, reportedly had hours of discussions with officers before the extreme measure was taken.

According to the LA Times, psychiatrist Dr Ernest Wagner told the court: 'When we order involuntary medications, the inmate is told they will receive medications whether they like it or not.'

He said the 31-year-old needed the medication to save his life. The prisoner was suicidal, according to Dr Wagner, hearing voices and eating his feces. A court ordered that the man be medicated.

Hearings are being held by District Judge Lawrence Karlton on the practice in Sacramento. The judge ordered the release of six tapes which are created by law as part of the prison practice.

The tapes were released without the prisoners or staff involved being identified.

Lawyers for inmates say that the pepper-spraying reveals extreme force at Corcoran and abuse of patients who are mentally ill and unable to understand what is going on.

The prisoner shown in the video above at times appears bewildered and to have little grasp of the situation.

He repeats: 'I don't know what you're doing'; Why is this happening' and 'I don't want to be executed' at several points in the 30-minute tape.

After he is injected with drugs, the prisoner is kept strapped down to the bed under doctor's orders.

The 31-year-old's sentence was increased by three months because he refused to follow orders.

In November 2012, he was moved to a psychiatric prison where he improved, according to court records. He was paroled in February of this year.

Guards press the naked and distressed prisoner against the door as part of the pepper-spraying measure, which officials say occurs only as a 'last resort'

Prison authorities say that the procedure is necessary as a last resort to have some prisoners take medication or move cell.

State
witnesses, including California's director of adult prisons, said that 
the videotape shows guards following proper procedure and that the 
method is safer than physical force.

In a statement to MailOnline, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation Assistant Secretary
Deborah Hoffman said: 'Use of force is always a last resort for our 
staff, and cell extractions are typically done to keep inmates from 
harming themselves or others and to ensure that they are placed in a 
more appropriate mental health setting.

'What
you don’t see on these videos is the hours of discussions that take 
place between the inmate and clinical staff before a cell extraction is 
ordered and the video camera starts rolling.

'As
we are always looking to improve our policies, CDCR is revising use of 
force policies to limit the duration of pepper spray applications, the 
total applications and the minimum waiting period between applications 
in non-emergency situations.'

The 31-year-old prisoner looks at his restraints and can be heard on tape telling the guards: 'I don't want to be executed'. Authorities said without the medication, the prisoner would have died
