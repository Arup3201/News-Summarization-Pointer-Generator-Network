Swimmers and surfers were forced to evacuate at the weekend following the sighting of a great white shark at a coastal beach.

Several jet skis and speed boats scoured the water at Merewether Beach on the coastline of NSW after the shark alarm sounded around 1pm on Saturday.

The coastal stretch between Nobbys and Stockton beaches in Newcastle remain closed for a third straight day after lifeguards spotted the large shark on Monday morning.

It's believed to be the same shark that was first spotted across the weekend and it appears to have moved up north, with the entire coastline being shut down to beachgoers.

Nearby resident, 14-year-old keen surfer Nicholas Tonks captured a photograph of the five-metre shark swimming behind a lifesaver on a jetski on Saturday.

'My house is pretty close to the beach so when I heard the shark alarm go off, I grabbed my camera and quickly dashed down,' the young photographer told Daily Mail Australia. 

'I was overlooking the beach and saw a lot of jetskis around so I looked through the lens of my camera and snapped a few shots. It wasn't until I got home, I realised I got a picture of the shark.'

'There were no attacks reported but the lifeguards did a great job to maintain and get everyone out of the water - they were very visual on their jetskis as well.'

Newcastle beaches have been closed for a third straight day following the sighting of a great white shark

Nobbys beach inspector Paul Bernard said: 'Our beaches are currently closed and the rest of the city's beaches will once again be closed today.'

A Westpac helicopter patrol returned with no sighting on Monday morning but lifeguards are continuing their watch.

'People have been sighting it from the break walls and lifeguards have been seeing fins in the water,' Mr Bernard told AAP.

'It's quite irregular to have them hanging around constantly,' he said.

He cited increased marine activity, overcast and warm weather as possible reasons for the shark's prolonged presence.

It comes just less than a week after multiple sharks were spotted at the iconic Bondi Beach, forcing beachgoers out of the water and shutting down for a couple of hours until it was all clear again.
