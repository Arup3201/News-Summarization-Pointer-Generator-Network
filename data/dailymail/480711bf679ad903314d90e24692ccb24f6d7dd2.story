Have you ever sent an explicit text, photo or video to someone? According to a recent study, one in three of us now regularly take part in ‘digital’ sexual encounters.

Over the past year, 34 per cent of men and women admitted to sending sexts, explicit photos on Snapchat or in chatrooms, or using webcams and videophones to have cyber sex.

The study also found almost 60 per cent had taken part in online sex, or had a sexual encounter with someone they weren’t in a relationship with.

The study was conducted by CyberCompare.net as part of research into the digital habits of people in the UK.

It focused specifically on the everyday activities people rely on technology and gadgets for.

A total of 1,612 men and women aged over 18 took part, and all classed themselves as ‘regularly sexually active.’

The most popular form of digital sex was sexting, at 37 per cent. Videophone sex came second at 30 per cent, while webcam sex was third with 26 per cent.

Almost a fifth of people in long-distance relationships said they used digital encounters to keep the passion alive, and 14 per cent of people in couples said it was necessary because work schedules kept them apart.

A small number, 6 per cent, said they interacted digitally with someone who wasn’t their current partner, and online sexual encounters were the only way they could see and speak to each other.

Videophone sex - 30 per cent

Webcam sex - 26 per cent

Sending explicit images on Snapchat (pictured right) - 15 per cent

Sending explicit messages in chatrooms - 7 per centThe top five reasons for digital sexual encounters

Lack of embarrassment more commonly associated with traditional encounters - 26 per cent

‘I am currently in a long-distance relationship and digital encounters keep the passion alive’ - 18 per cent

Different work schedules mean lack of time spent together - 14 per cent

‘I don’t enjoy actual sex but I enjoy the thrill and fantasy of digital encounters’ - 11 per cent

'The person I interact with digitally is not my current partner or spouse and this is the only way we can see and speak to each other'-  6 per cent

Explicit encounters on Snapchat were 
had by 15 per cent of participants, and 7 per cent had experienced 
digital sex in a chatroom.

More than a fifth said they preferred ‘digital’ sex because it was less embarrassing than traditional sex.

One in ten admitted they didn’t enjoy physical sex, but enjoyed the ‘thrill and fantasy of digital encounters.’

The most common place for digital sexual encounters was at home (71 per cent), although 8 per cent said they’d done so at work.

Lead researcher at CyberCompare.net, Kimberley Shapley, said: ‘Technology is infiltrating pretty much every element of everyday life now, even our sex lives it seems!

‘To see that one in three sexual encounters are now digital was surprising, and perhaps a little telling about how people approach sex nowadays. No longer do we have to be in the same room, or even the same country, as someone to have a ‘sexual encounter’ with them- there are apps to do that for us!’

Recent research from McAfee found just over half of adults who have exchanged intimate or sexually explicit content still have it stored on their mobile device, despite the fact that one in three do not even have the most basic password protection on their smartphones.

Of those that do have protection, just over 40 per cent use the same details for multiple internet connected devices, increasing the likelihood these devices will be hacked. 

Shockingly, the U.S. version of the study also revealed that 16 per cent of Americans have sent a sext to a stranger.

Meanwhile, a YouGov poll commissioned by the Huffington Post found 85 per cent of men and women consider sexting to be a form of cheating.

In a YouGov poll of 1,000 U.S. adults commissioned by the Huffington Post, 85 per cent of female respondents deemed the non-physical act dishonest, as did 74 per cent of men. 

The study was conducted by CyberCompare.net. A total of 1,612 men and women aged over 18 took part. The most popular form of digital sex was sexting at 37 per cent. Videophone sex came second at 30 per cent, while webcam sex was third with 26 per cent

A study released before Christmas suggests that many racy photos and messages, known as sexts, are sent out of obligation to a partner, instead of for fun.

Young people in committed relationships regularly send and receive unwanted sexts out of necessity and men are just as unenthusiastic about them as women, according to a study.

U.S. scientists behind the study have dubbed the messages not sent for pleasure as ‘requisexts’.

The research by Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne reveals that just as some couples go along with sex to please their partner or avoid an argument, the same is true of e-sex and sexts.

It found 55 per cent of female participants admitted to sexting when not in the mood, while 48 per cent of men said they had done the same as a way to please a partner.

The numbers are similar to a previous report about ‘compliant sexual activity’ which revealed that 55 per cent of U.S. women and 35 per cent of men had had sex to keep their partner happy when they weren’t feeling like it.

Facebooking a former flame and forming a close bond with someone via text or email were also outed as adulterous acts.

A sex simulator was unveiled in Tokyo last year that provides a fully immersive 3D experience using the Oculus Rift visor.

One developer, known only as ‘Ressentiment’, created the sex robot by combining an Oculus Rift with a controller that triggers sensations on the body, called a Novint Falcon.

The Novint Falcon, a type of grip-based, haptic controller - manipulates a Tenga.  A Tenga is a Japanese device designed for self-pleasure which holds the user's penis.
