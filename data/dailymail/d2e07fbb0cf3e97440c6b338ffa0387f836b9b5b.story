A Saudi woman who worked on a liberal blog with jailed activist Raif Badawi has been freed after almost three months in prison, her daughter has said.

Suad al-Shammari was jailed for insulting Islam after co-founding online discussion group the Saudi Liberal Network with Badawi, who was sentenced to ten years jail and 1,000 lashes for his blogging.

As outrage mounts on the kingdom over Badawi's sentence, al-Shammari has been released after 90 days at a women's prison in the Red Sea city of Jeddah, her daughter Sarah al-Rimaly said.

'She's released now, thanks be to God,' Ms Rimaly told AFP, adding that her mother left jail three days ago after signing a pledge 'to reduce her activities'.

Saudi Arabia's new King Salman late on Thursday issued an amnesty for some prisoners, but Miss Rimaly said her mother's release was unconnected to this.

She added that she does not think the amnesty will cover Badawi, whose flogging was on Friday postponed for the third week in a row.

Badawi's corporal punishment had been set to be dealt out piecemeal each Friday but he has so far endured only one set of 50 lashes.

The 31-year-old won support from governments and human rights groups around the world after he was sentenced to the hefty jail time, the lashes and a £177,000 fine.

Al-Shammari, who helped Badawi set up the Saudi Liberal Network, was arrested in late October for insulting Islam after posting comments on Twitter about Islamic religious leaders, Saudi activists said at the time.

The charges against Badawi were also brought over criticism of clerics and the Saudi Arabia's notorious religious police, who have been accused of a heavy-handed enforcement of sharia Islamic law.

Paris-based watchdog Reporters Without Borders (RSF) described the SLN Internet site as 'an online discussion network whose aim is to encourage political, religious and social debates in Saudi Arabia'.

Badawi endured the first 50 lashes of his sentence outside a mosque in Jeddah on January 9, but two subsequent rounds of punishment were posted on medical grounds.

It is not clear why the latest round of flogging was postponed, according to Badawi's wife, Ensaf Haidar, who has since fled to Canada with their three children.

Speaking to reporters and lawmakers in Canada, where she has sought asylum with their three children, she said on Thursday that Badawi's health is 'bad and it's getting worse'. 

Last week, Badawi's spokesman said there was a chance he could have his jail sentence reduced.

Dr Elham Manea, who is a professor at the University of Zurich, said the Saudi ambassador in Germany had told a broadcaster of the development.

In a posting on her Facebook page, she wrote: 'Saudi ambassador in Germany informed NDR-TV that flogging will not continue and #RaifBadawi maybe not (sic) have to serve the whole time in prison.'

Badawi is among more than a dozen 'prisoners of conscience' behind bars for their peaceful activism in Saudi Arabia, according to rights group Amnesty International.
