They are one of the most formidable pairings in the fashion industry: the hottest model of the moment and one of most iconic designers of all time.

But it seems that while they have undertaken numerous successful projects together, and she fronts his campaigns and closes his catwalk shows, Karl Lagerfeld does not consider model Cara Delevingne to be ‘beautiful’, at least not in the classical sense.

The 80-year-old powerhouse, who has sat at the head of Chanel since 1983, said that Cara is ‘not a standout beauty’.

Cara also helped closed Chanel's AW14 show in Paris at the beginning of the month, walking hand-in- hand with Karl down the 'runway' which was set up as a supermarket aisle

Speaking to the Guardian, Karl said that Cara’s looks are based on her ‘strange’ proportions.

‘Was it Bacon who said, 'There is not beauty without some strangeness in the proportions'?’ he said.

And it seems that he also is not a fan of two of Cara’s favourite pastimes; tattoos and selfies.

Karl said that while Cara is not a 'standout beauty', her 'strange proportions' give her charm

He says: ‘They are this horrible thing where you are distorted. The chin is too big, the head is too small. No, this is electronic masturbation.’

And while it seems barely a week goes by without either Cara herself, or another young star, getting a new inking (and of course sharing it on social media), Karl disapproves.

‘Tattoos are like sleeping in a printed T-shirt, you will never get clean again,’ he says.

However, the pairing of Cara and Chanel is unlikely to end soon, despite the 21-year-old admitting she has no plans to stop adding to her collection of body art.

The French fashion house’s favourite model closed Chanel’s AW14 show in Paris at the beginning of the month, walking down the runway with Karl on a huge set designed to look like a very stylish supermarket.

Karl, well known for his theatrical shows - which have previously featured giant icebergs and even an underwater kingdom - transformed the French capital's Grand Palais into the world's chicest and most luxurious grocery store.
