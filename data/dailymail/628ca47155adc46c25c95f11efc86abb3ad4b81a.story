A mother who went on a huge shopping spree after she discovered £52,000 had mistakenly been put into her bank account has defended her actions.

In a case which has divided moral opinion, Michaela Hutchings, 23, spent £9,000 
on expensive designer shoes, handbags and sunglasses in a two-day 
spending splurge after finding the transfer from her council.

She also gave her mother £1,000 in cash, and put 
£40,000 into a savings account, before she was caught by police on April
 24 last year.

Cheers: Michaela Hutchings went on a spending spree after she found her £52,000 in her bank account. She was on Monday found guilty of dishonesty and retaining a wrongly credited bank transfer

While some have taken to social media sites to criticise her since her appearance at Stafford Crown Court, others - including her family - have defended her actions, claiming that 'anyone would have done the same.'

Speaking to the Sunday Mirror, Miss Hutchings said: 'All of this is my fault and I feel so sorry. I put my family in a position where they are being looked down on by everyone.

She described the day that she discovered the money, after going to the shop to buy some milk.

'Then when I went to the cashpoint to take out some money I checked my balance and ­everything changed. There was over £50,000 in there. I didn’t know what to do. Who would?'

She claims that when she asked the cashier where the money had come from, she could not say.

She added that had she known it was from the council she would not have touched it.

The young mother said that her former boyfriend - who is currently in custody awaiting trial for drug related offences - told her to keep the money.

Under the 1968 Theft Act, if you realise money has been paid into your bank account by mistake, you must repay it.

Keeping
 the unexpected windfall could lead to a charge of ‘dishonestly 
retaining wrongful credit’ and to a prison sentence of up to  ten years.

In
 rare cases defendants have successfully argued that they did not 
realise they had been paid the money in error and have not had to return
 it.

She added: 'But also, part of me liked the idea that I suddenly had all that money. I was a single mum – money isn’t always easy. But this was not how I was brought up.'

Hutchings was found guilty of 
dishonesty and retaining a wrongly credited bank transfer when she 
appeared at Stafford Crown Court last week.

Recorder Derek Desmond accepted she had been encouraged to spend by her boyfriend.

Hutchings,
 who works part-time at her parents’ vehicle hire company, was given a 
12-month community order and told to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work.

The
 court heard an administrative error meant Lichfield District Council 
accidentally transferred £52,000 into her account. Hutchings allegedly 
ignored repeated phone calls and visits and claimed she thought the 
money was an inheritance.

She has signed forms for police to release the £40,000 she invested back to the council.

Although her crime carries a sentence of up to 10 years’ imprisonment, she was spared jail after ­admitting the offences.

She said that her one bad decision had changed her life: 'I did wrong and I’m sorry but before you judge me put yourself in my shoes.'
