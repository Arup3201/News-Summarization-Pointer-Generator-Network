David Cameron's decision to remove Michael Gove as Education Secretary is an act of folly for which our children will pay a heavy price.

Gove is the one man in the Cabinet who entered office with a clear vision of what he needed to change in his department and proceeded to force through his reforms against visceral resistance from the Left, teachers and his own civil servants.

For four years, he has been a lightning conductor for their hatred. Now that he is to step down, the Prime Minister has handed a trophy to his enemies.

Impact: The decision to remove Michael Gove is an act of folly for which our children will pay a heavy price. Will Nicky Morgan, Gove’s successor, be able to withstand the brickbats and bullying tactics of the Left?

For the bone-idle education system bureaucrats, teachers’ union bosses and the Marxist ideologues who dominate the education establishment, Gove’s departure is a cause for rejoicing.

When he first took on the role, he signalled a revolution by renaming his ministry. Out went the vapid ‘Department for Children, Schools and Families’ in favour of plain old ‘Department for Education’.

Here, at last, was a Conservative Education Secretary who was not ashamed of old-fashioned views: that children go to school to learn, not to have fun; that classroom discipline is essential; that knowledge is better than ignorance.

The Gove revolution has been driven through with messianic zeal.

Although the teaching unions have fought him tooth and nail all the way, the results of Gove’s actions are already transforming the prospects of the younger generation.

It is a tragedy that the man whose courage and energy started this revolution is now to be denied the chance to finish the job.

Adopted as a boy by an Aberdeen family of modest means, Gove has risen by his own efforts. In the Cameron Cabinet of the privileged and the entitled, he was the scholarship boy who made good. He also stands in stark contrast to his Labour counterpart, the Hon Tristram Hunt, a son of privilege.

Gove’s great, transformative insight was that our education system had departed too far from the traditional aim of passing on our British culture — ‘the best which has been thought and said’ — in favour of a vague notion of developing ‘skills’.

Bravely, he immediately set about filling the intellectual vacuum left by decades of the Left’s ‘progressive’ education policies. He did so with a bloody-minded determination to give every child the best possible chance of success in life.

He insisted that pupils should learn history, especially British history, as a continuous narrative rather than as isolated incidents: ‘The Tudors’, ‘The Trenches’, ‘The Blitz’. He demanded that they should read the Classics and learn poems by heart.

He wanted children to emerge from school as rounded, educated, articulate adults, capable of competing with the best in the world. Despite his reputation as the teachers’ bogeyman, Gove has inspired hundreds of dedicated young men and women to found new free schools.

Parents have eagerly embraced the greater choice available as they chose a school for their children.

Yesterday, the gloating of the Left over Gove’s demise spoke volumes about how effective he’d been. Among them was the far-Left NUT leader Christine Blower, who sneered that his departure would be a lovely end-of-term surprise for her members and boasted that their strikes had claimed his scalp.

Reaction: On the front page of the NUT website, a huge picture of Gove had been posted with the caption: ‘Gone!' Pictured right, he looks down during his appearance on the Andrew Marr show earlier this month

Grinning from ear to ear, Hunt looked as if he could hardly believe his luck. On Twitter, there was crowing from the Left-wing commentator Owen Jones, who said: ‘Cheers, whoops and other outbursts of jubilation sweep the nation’s staff rooms as disastrous Michael Gove stripped of education and demoted.’

Gove’s removal is fraught with risk. In his absence, the education department is like Hamlet without the Prince.

Will Nicky Morgan, Gove’s successor, be able to withstand the brickbats and bullying tactics of the Left? Already, yesterday, union leaders were calling on Morgan to abandon his reforms.

Labour remains ideologically opposed to the educational principles and traditional values that underlie the Gove revolution. The fact that his Labour shadow Hunt pays lip service to free schools and other parts of the Gove legacy should not deceive us.

In a Cabinet of conformists, Gove has always been his own man. In the 20 years that I have known him, both in journalism and politics, I have never once seen Michael betray his principles. Such integrity is very rare in a politician at any time and even rarer in the Tory Party of today.

Cameron’s demotion of Gove is a tragic demonstration that he does not understand what his own government will undoubtedly be remembered for. Together with Iain Duncan Smith’s war on Britain’s bloated welfare dependency culture and George Osborne’s success at the Treasury, Gove got things done.

When historians look back on the Coalition, they will recall that it turned round the economy, reformed welfare and started to restore sanity to our schools. But by taking his most brilliant minister out of the political front-line, Cameron has put the future of education in this country in jeopardy.
