Revealed: Jane Austen's will was among more than a million published online today

With the Bennett sisters among her most famous creations, it comes as no surprise that Jane Austen left most of her worldly assets to her own sibling, according to her will published online today.

The novelist's last request was for her 'dearest' sister Cassandra to receive all of her possessions, spare the cost of her funeral, £50 - the equivalent of £1,700 in today's money - to her brother Henry and another £50 to his cook.

Austen's will was among a collection of thousands, including those of William Shakespeare and Sir Francis Drake, which were published online for the first time today.

Just like her characters Jane and Elizabeth Bennett, Austen and Cassandra were extremely close, so much so that the writer left the majority of her estate, worth around £800 (more than £27,000 today), to her elder sister.

During Austen's lifetime the pair wrote hundreds of letters to one another, and it is from these missives that historians were able to gather much of what is known about the author.

Austen also left a sum of money to her brother Henry, who helped her to get her books published, and to his cook Madame Bigeon.

The will was written just months before Austen's death in July 1817 following a long illness, believed to be Addison's disease, at the age of just 41.

She wrote: 'I Jane Austen of the Parish of Chawton do by this my last Will & 
Testament give and bequeath to my dearest Sister Cassandra Elizth every 
thing of which I may die possessed, or which may be hereafter due to me,
 subject to the payment of my Funeral Expences, & to a Legacy of £50 to my Brother Henry, & £50 to Mde Bigeon - which I request may 
be paid as soon as convenient.

'And I appoint my said dear Sister the 
Executrix of this my last Will & Testament.'

The collection of wills, including Austen's, is the most comprehensive collection of its kind, covering 1384 to 1858, and
detailing the assets, occupation and the standard of living of the dead.

According to his will, William Shakespeare left £150 (£14,400 today) to his daughter Judith in 1616, and famously decreed that his 'second best bed' should go to his wife Anne.

However, historians believe that during Shakespeare's life time wealthy families would reserve their best bed for guests, meaning the gift was actually far more sentimental than at first glance.

Under common law Anne also had a right to one third of his estate and to live their marital home for the rest of her life, which she did.

Most of the playwright's possessions went to his daughter Susanna and her husband John Hall.

Sir Francis Drake, who died of dysentery at the age of 55 in January 1596, left £40 (£4,000 today) to the 'poor people' of Plymouth.

Miriam Silverman of Ancestry.co.uk, which is publishing the collection, said: 'These probate records provide fascinating insight into the final fortunes of some of our nation's most famous names, right down to who should get their bed.

'They are an incredibly valuable family history resource, covering a period in history from which few official documents remain.'
