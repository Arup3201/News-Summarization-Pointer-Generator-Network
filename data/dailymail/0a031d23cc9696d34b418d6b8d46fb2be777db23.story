Public Health England is urging parents, schools and doctors to look out for the signs of scarlet fever, which causes a red, sandpaper-like rash

Parents have been warned to look out for the signs of the highly contagious scarlet fever, following a 'steep rise' in cases.

Public Health England (PHE) said 1,265 new cases were reported in the first six weeks of 2015.

Last week alone saw 300 new cases recorded across the country.

It comes before the 'high season' in March and April when experts expect to see the highest number of cases.

NHS officials warn the condition typically infects between 2,000 and 4,000 cases.

But more than 14,000 cases were reported in England last year - the highest since the 1960s.

PHE said the rise this year is 'above what is typical for this time of the year', and advised schools, nurseries and parents to be vigilant to the signs.

They urged people to let local health protection teams know as soon as possible, if they fear children are infected.

The bacterial illness is characterised by a distinctive pink, red rash that feels like sandpaper to touch.

Dr Theresa Lamagni, PHE's head of streptococcal infection surveillance, said: 'The first symptoms of scarlet fever include a sore throat and fever, which may be accompanied by a headache, nausea and vomiting.

'Between 12 to 48 hours after this, a characteristic fine, sandpapery rash develops, often appearing first on the chest or stomach.

'Individuals who think they or their child may have scarlet fever should consult their GP.' 

She added: 'As we enter into high season for scarlet fever, we ask GPs and other front line medical staff to be mindful of the current high level of activity when assessing patients.

'Prompt notification of cases to local health protection teams is critical to enable local monitoring and rapid response to outbreaks.

Scarlet fever is a bacterial illness that causes a distinctive pink-red rash.

It typically starts in one area of the body, but soon spreads to many parts, including the ears, neck and chest.

The rash can be itchy and feels like sandpaper to touch.

Other symptoms include a high temperature, flushed face and a red, swollen tongue.

The first symptoms often develop two to five days after infection, although a sufferer will already be contagious before showing signs of the illness.

Scarlet fever is often triggered by a sore throat or skin infection, such as impetigo, which are caused by particular strainsof streptococcus bacteria. 

'Schools and nurseries should similarly be mindful of the current elevated levels of scarlet fever and promptly inform local health protection teams at an early stage if they become aware of cases, especially if more than one child is affected.'

She said symptoms usually clear up after a week and in the majority of cases 'remain reasonably mild' providing antibiotics are taken.

Dr Lamagni advised anyone who fears they or any family member has scarlet fever to stay at home until at least 24 hours after starting antibiotic treatment.

Scarlet fever is mainly a childhood disease and is most common between the ages of two and eight. 

It was once a very dangerous infection but is now less threatening, although complications can happen especially if sufferers do not get treated.

The first sign of the bacterial infection, which commonly affects children aged two to eight, is often a fever. In the first six weeks of this year health bosses have recorded 1,265 cases - higher than average (file picture)
