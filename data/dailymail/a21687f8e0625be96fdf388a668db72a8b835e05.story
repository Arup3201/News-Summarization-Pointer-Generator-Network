 A prisoner is free, relatively speaking, after spending part of the weekend with his arm stuck in a toilet.

Maintenance and emergency teams at the State Correctional Institution-Coal Township in Shamokin, Pennsylvania, worked for several hours and wound up removing the toilet from its moorings to free the trapped limb.

The prisoner's arm became stuck on Sunday morning when he reached into the toilet to fetch an item that had fallen in, a prison spokeswoman told The News Item.

They said removing the toilet allowed the man to pull his hand out of a connecting pipe and free his arm.

He was freed after several hours work by maintenance crews and suffered no injuries.  

Officials didn't release the prisoner's name. 

State Correctional Institution Coal Township opened in May 1993 and is a medium-security facility for male inmates.
