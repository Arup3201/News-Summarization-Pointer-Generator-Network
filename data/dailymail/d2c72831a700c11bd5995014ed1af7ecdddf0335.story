Mauro Icardi scored a hat-trick as Inter Milan trounced Sassuolo 7-0 in their second game of the Serie A season.

Dani Osvaldo twice got his name on the scoresheet while Freddy Guarin and Croatian youngster Mateo Kovacic completed the rout.

Walter Mazzari's side were a goal up within four minutes, Icardi's strike setting the tone for the one-sided game that would follow.

The Sassuolo defence always looked shaky and it left Icardi in acres of space on the half hour to control Hernanes' pass and curl into the bottom right corner from outside the area. 

It was then Osvaldo's turn to open his Inter account four minutes from half time after Dodo's initial shot was blocked by Consigli.

Icardi completed his hat-trick eight minutes into the second half, with Kovacic again the provider and any hope Sassuolo had of keeping the scoreline down evaporated shortly afterwards when Berardi was dismissed.

Guarin generously set up Osvaldo for the forward's second before getting on the scoresheet himself as Inter matched last season's result.

The 28-year-old Osvaldo, on loan from Southampton, has already scored twice as many goals for Inter as he did during the entirety of his loan spell at Juventus last season.

Inter move up to third in the table, two points behind Roma and Juventus, while Sassuolo drop down to 18th.

Micah Richards joined Italian side Fiorentina as he continues his pursuit of first steam football, but unfortunately for the 26-year-old he was an unsued substitute as the Viola played out a goalless draw at home to Genoa.

Napoli were hoping for a timely boost after a poor start to the season. They lost a Champions League play-off to Athletic Bilbao and then struggled before scoring an injury-time goal for a 2-1 win at Genoa in its Serie A opener.

Things seemed to be looking up when they was awarded a penalty in the 26th minute after Bostjan Cesar tripped Gonzalo Higuain. However, Chievo goalkeeper Francesco Bardi dove to his right to brilliantly save the Argentine's spot kick.

Maxi Lopez hit the crossbar moments later and that proved to be a warning shot as he scored his first goal since February three minutes into the second half, finishing off a Chievo counter attack.

There was better news for Lazio, who had started the season with a 3-1 defeat at Milan.

Former Cesena players Antonio Candreva and Marco Parolo scored either side of halftime before Stefano Mauri capped a positive result in stoppage time. 

Sampdoria beat Torino 2-0 in the lunchtime kickoff and said it will donate half of the gate receipts to ALS research.
