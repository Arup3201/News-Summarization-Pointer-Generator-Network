The commission that has investigated doping in cycling will not be recommending that Lance Armstrong’s lifetime ban from competitive sport is reduced.

The American stripped of his seven Tour de France titles for using performance-enhancing drugs was hoping the Cycling Independent Reform Commission would be more sympathetic after he twice gave evidence to the three-man panel.

But CIRC, who submitted their report to the UCI last Friday and are due to hold a media briefing in Switzerland next week, are not planning to recommend to the United States Anti-Doping Agency that they reduce their ban.

Some reports suggested on Sunday that lawyers representing Armstrong placed certain limitations on what CIRC could ask, which in turn was being given as a reason for the stance CIRC have now adopted.

But Armstrong’s legal team vehemently deny that, insisting that no restrictions were placed on CIRC in their two interviews with the Texan.

Only recently Armstrong suggested to the BBC that he had answered all CIRC’s questions candidly. ‘At this point in my life I’m not out to protect anybody,’ he said. ‘I’m out to protect seven people and they all have the last name Armstrong.’

Armstrong is sure to be angered by the fact that a number of his contemporaries – who have also been guilty of doping offences – did not even cooperate with CIRC and yet remain senior figures in the sport.

Brian Cookson, the UCI president, had warned that such a lack of cooperation would be frowned upon and it will be interesting to see if he sticks to his promise of introducing a fit-and-proper-person test for cycling team officials in the wake of the CIRC report.

Cookson has said the report will make ‘uncomfortable’ reading for his sport.

‘When you open a can of worms you find a lot of worms,’ Cookson said last month at the world track cycling championships in Paris. ‘I think it’s going to be very interesting - there will be a lot of uncomfortable things there.’

Chris Froome revealed to Sportsmail that he has spoken to the CIRC about the problem of doping

But he also took a swipe at Armstrong, accusing him of having an ‘agenda’ for revealing he had spoken to CIRC in the first place.

Armstrong obviously does have an agenda; he wants his ban reduced when other dopers from his era have not been hit with the same severe sanctions.

But criticising anyone for revealing they have spoken to CIRC seems a curious position to adopt when the promise of anonymity might yet protect those who haven’t come forward.

Only last week Chris Froome revealed to Sportsmail that he too has spoken to CIRC, having wanted to give a senior rider’s perspective on the problems that continue to undermine the UCI’s efforts to clean up the sport. Particularly at a time when the UCI are pushing for the racing licence of the Astana team – that boasts current Tour de France champion Vicenzo Nibali – to be revoked.
