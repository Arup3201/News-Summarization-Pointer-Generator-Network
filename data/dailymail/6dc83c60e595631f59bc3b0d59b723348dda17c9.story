At a Nashville detention center with a long history of violence, escape attempts and sexual-abuse allegations, more than two dozen teens broke out of a common area and created a large disturbance in the yard Wednesday night, roaming the area with sticks and spraying a fire extinguisher.

Officials said two staff members suffered minor injuries at Woodland Hills Youth Development Center, where just two days earlier, 32 teens escaped after finding a weak spot in the fence surrounding the yard. Six remained at large Thursday.

On Wednesday night, about 28 teens - some of whom were part of the initial breakout - kicked out metal panels underneath the windows in a common area to reach the yard. This time, police formed a ring around the center's perimeter fence to try to prevent another escape.

Video shot by Nashville station WTVF showed teens chasing and assaulting a man who appeared to be a staff member. Photos in The Tennessean newspaper showed teens in the detention center yard carrying sticks. One showed someone spraying a fire extinguisher.

Others were spotted on the roof of the facility throwing rocks.

The second violent escape attempt in a week began late Wednesday night. The teens got out of their dorm rooms and were roaming the facility, reports WFTV. 

Two staff members suffered minor injuries in the uprising.

It wasn't until SWAT teams and helicopters descended on the facility that the teenagers were brought under control. None of them managed to breach the perimeter fence.

Ten ringleaders were identified and brought to another detention center, Tennessee Department of Children's Services spokesman Rob Johnson said. The rest were returned to their dorms.

Some of the teenagers involved in Wednesday's escape were also a part of Monday's breakout.  

This week's incidents are the latest in a string of troubles for the facility, where most of the 14- to 19-year-olds have committed at least three felonies. The center saw a spike in assaults in 2012 after the state placed older teenagers there from a shuttered facility in eastern Tennessee. 

Between July and September that year, police had to be called at least 47 times for assistance, which surpassed total police visits for the previous two years combined.

Among the acts of violence listed in police records is a guard trapped in a headlock and repeatedly punched by a young man. Another assault involved four youths ambushing a staff member and beating him until he was rescued by colleagues.

In 2010, the U.S. Department of Justice ranked Woodland Hills as 13th in the country among juvenile facilities with reports of sexual abuse by staffers.

In a 2004 breakout attempt, more than a dozen teens armed with broom handles and hurling bricks injured 16 staffers before they were dispersed by police in riot gear. 

On Monday night, 32 teens 'overwhelmed' their minders at the center by simultaneously breaking out of four dormitories and then crawling under a weak spot in a chain-link fence. By Thursday morning, six were still on the run.

Police caught up with some walking along roads or coming out of the woods. Some turned themselves in, including one at the guard shack Tuesday evening. And some were swiftly returned to the detention center by their own families for their own good.

'He broke loose, he was gone, but he's back now,' said LaWanda Knowles, whose nephew joined the escape. 'I just want to know that he's here safely and he's OK - I don't want the police jumping on him, nobody beating on him or nothing.'

The teens left their rooms at the Woodland Hills Youth Development Center at about 11 p.m. Monday night and gathered in common areas. With just 16 unarmed adults to keep watch over 78 youths in 12 dormitories, the staff was 'overwhelmed,' said Tennessee Department of Children's Services spokesman Rob Johnson.

'Staffing was lighter during the overnight hours, so presumably they had planned for that,' Johnson said.

The groups of young men kicked out metal panels under the windows of each dorm to get into the yard, and then ran around for a while before some started slipping through the chain-link fence that encircles their campus. The fence is buried 8 inches deep into the ground, but the teens found a spot where they could slip out underneath it.

None of the staff were hurt, and initially they simply called other staffers for backup to help bring the teens back into the dormitories. Once they spotted the teens escaping the perimeter, they alerted police, and the Tennessee Highway Patrol joined the search.

Knowles said police had come searching for her nephew around 5 a.m. at his home about 8 miles from the facility. The teen showed up about two hours later, and briefly saw his parents and family, she said.

'He wanted to see his mom, and nieces and nephews and his sisters, so he came home,' she said. 'But when we found out that he ran, I jumped in my truck and put him in there and brought him back.'

On the run: Six teenagers are still on the loose after Monday night's escape from Woodland Hills 

Troubled: Police were called to the facility 47 times in 2012, and there have been two escapes in three days

Once back in custody, the teens who escaped were being taken to juvenile court to face potential escape charges, officials said.

Most of the 78 juvenile delinquents held at the center Monday night had committed at least three felonies, Johnson said, but the facility is more like a high school with security than an adult prison. There are no guard towers or barbed wire.

The teens stay in single rooms that for their own security are locked on the outside, so that only those with keys can enter. But they can push their room doors open if they need to. They wear blue pants with white or light gray T-shirts, with no markings.

The center has a school, offers vocational training and career counseling, and works to move teens to less restrictive settings, according to a state website. It holds them until their 19th birthdays. All have been charged as juveniles, not adults. 

The Department of Children's Services will review that longstanding policy for all three of the state's juvenile detention centers, Commissioner Jim Henry said. It's difficult for staff to maintain control when the teens can open doors to enter common areas, he said.
