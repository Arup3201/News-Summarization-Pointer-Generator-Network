Want to boost your bust in time for your summer break but can't afford to splash out on surgery? British organic brand, Orico, claims to have the solution.

Its latest launch is Full Cup Bust and Neck Enhancing Elixir, £27, which is said to add up to 4cm (the equivalent of two cup sizes) to your breasts after just six weeks of use.

The elixir's breast-boosting ability is said to be the result of mukul extract; a resin extracted from the bark of the Guggul myrrh tree.

Enhancing: Orico say that their Full Bust Elixir can add two to four centimetres to the breasts within six weeks

According to Orico, the natural extract 
has been clinically proven to have a 're-pulping' or plumping effect on 
breast tissue and also helps to fill in wrinkles by increasing lipid 
(fat) storage.

'The oleoresin active in Full Cup helps with skin tonicity by increasing lipid storage on the breast,' said a spokesperson for the company.

'It has been clinically proven to re-pulp existing lipid cells so helps the breasts become fuller depending on the level of existing lipid cells after six weeks of use.

'In terms of augmentation I would say no. It can only work with what we have naturally and [is] not like synthetic breast implants that create larger breasts.

'We have also developed a lime and 
orange essential oil blend which helps with increasing circulation and 
is uplifting aromatherapy, all in a natural light oil base to be used 
for massaging the area and to help with skin moisture levels.'

The resin has a long history of use, 
although more commonly as a perfume ingredient. Called Bdellium in the 
Bible, it is similar to myrrh and was a key part of the merchandise on 
the caravans that travelled the Arabic Incense Road.

Along with its use in perfume, mukul 
extract has long played a part in ayurvedic medicine, in particular as a
 treatment for obesity. 

But despite being an effective anti-obesity aid, not everyone is convinced by its claims to increase the size of the breasts.

Dr. Roberto Viel of The London Centre of Aesthetic Surgery said: 'These creams are an intensive moisturising system, but as for boosting breast size or plumpness, I don't believe this will have any effect.

'Surgery is the only option if you want firmer or larger breasts, and it can now be done in a number of ways from a very natural effect fat transfer (using fat taken from elsewhere in the body) to breast implants.

'Though these creams have good intent, I do not believe ingredients such as extracts or oils would do much in the way of  plumping breast as creams only penetrate the top layer of skin, though they will, I'm sure, add moisture to the skin.'
