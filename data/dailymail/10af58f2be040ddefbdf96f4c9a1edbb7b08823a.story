A Salvador Dali painting that was stolen from an upmarket New York gallery last week has been returned – through the post.

The $150,000 (£95,651) painting was mailed back from Europe and intercepted at Kennedy international Airport, U.S. Postal Inspection Service said.

It was snatched last week in broad daylight by a man posing as a customer.

Audacious: The thief, who was posing as a customer, was caught on CCTV leaving the gallery with the painting's frame poking out of his bag

The brazen thief walked into the Venus Over Manhattan art gallery, on Madison Avenue and simply removed 
the painting from the wall, put it in a shopping bag and walked out.

Gallery owner and art dealer Adam 
Lindemann told police the thief took the piece during 'regular business 
hours, with a security guard'.

The watercolour and ink piece, ‘Cartel des Don Juan Tenorio’, was painted in by Dali in 1949.

The $150,000 work of art was swiped 
from a Madison Avenue art gallery last week by a man posing as a 
customer who walked out with the watercolor and ink painting in a 
shopping bag.

Surveillance footage shows the man carrying a heavyweight paper shopping bag into the third-floor gallery.

Stolen: The $150,000 Dali painting - Cartel des Don Juan Tenorio - was completed in 1949 and formed part of the gallery's inaugural exhibition

Surrealist: Spanish artist Salvador Dali, who died in 1989, was famous for his paintings of melted clocks and dream-like landscapes

The CCTV footage shows the frame from the painting poking out of the top of his shopping bag.

Inspection service spokeswoman Donna Harris tells The New York Times the gallery received an email this week that said the painting had been sent back.

The email contained a tracking number and the gallery contacted police who could intercept the painting on Friday.

No arrests have been made.

The 1949 painting, was part of the Venus Over Manhattan art gallery's very first exhibition. The gallery didn't comment.
