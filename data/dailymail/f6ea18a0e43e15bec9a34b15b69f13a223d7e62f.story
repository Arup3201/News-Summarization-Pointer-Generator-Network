Rumours about Apple’s bending iPhone 6 Plus show no signs of dying down.

Now two teenagers have decided to take reports about the phone’s alleged flaw into their own hands.

In a five-minute video, two 15-year-old boys step into an Apple store to try to bend a gold iPhone 6 Plus.

Hands-on: In a five-minute video, two 15-year-old boys step into an Apple store to try to bend a gold iPhone 6 Plus. They use so much pressure that the screen on the phone pops out

They use so much pressure that the screen on the phone pops out, causing the teenagers to say they have to run away or ‘they would have ended up paying for it’.

The boys, thought to be from Norfolk, then ask a shop worker whether or not an iPhone 6 Plus could bend.

It is believed that the thinner model, as well as the use of aluminium metal in its design, causes the frame to deform.

But the Apple employee denies the claims saying it’s an ‘internet rumour.’

'Deformation' refers to the point at which the phone began to bend. 

'Case separation' was the point at which the display became disconnected from the case.

One of the teenagers involved in the video said: ‘The reason why we were laughing was because it was really funny.

‘We were in the Apple store bending and breaking their iPhone, which I guess is criminal damage but I don’t even care, to be honest.

‘It’s Apple’s fault – they are false advertising, saying it’s the best iPhone but clearly it’s not if it can bend in your hands or your pocket. It’s just ridiculous.’

The duo aren’t the only ones attempting to bend the iPhone 6 Plus, with reports suggesting damaged iPhone can be seen throughout Apple’s stores.

Some customers have even attempted to bend the allegedly less prone iPhone 6. Apple has yet to comment on the matter.

Apple has acknowledged there are issues with new iPhones bending under some circumstances, but it added that it has only received nine official complaints.

Experts from Consumer Reports recently suggested some of these claims may have been exaggerated.

During their own stress tests, they found the iPhone 6 Plus can withstand more force than has been previously claimed - and that it is more sturdy than the HTC One (M8) and the smaller iPhone 6.

The first reports of bendy iPhones began on Wednesday last week when photos appeared online showing the top of the device bent out of shape. YouTube user Lewis Hilsenteger then posted a video showing the iPhone 6 Plus bending using just his fingers, which has already been viewed more than 45.3 million times

The controversy was dubbed 'BendGate'. It led to internet jokers posting photos, mocking the unintended new feature (pictured). A number of these images went viral on social media

The first reports of bendy iPhones began on Wednesday last week when photos appeared online showing the top of the device bent out of shape.

YouTube user Lewis Hilsenteger then posted a video showing the iPhone 6 Plus bending using just his fingers, which has already been viewed more than 45.3 million times.

To put these claims to the test, Consumer Reports used a so-called ‘three-point flexural test.’

This involved supporting the phone at two points on either end before applying a force on the top of the device.

In addition to the iPhone 6 Plus, the researchers tested the iPhone 6, HTC One (M8), LG G3, Samsung Galaxy Note 3, and the iPhone 5.

According to Consumer Reports, the HTC One (M8) (pictured) was the weakest of the handsets tested. It started to deform and bend when a total of 70lbs (31.75kg) of force was applied. This was on par with the iPhone 6. The HTC handset separated from its case when a force of 90lbs (40kg) was applied

Despite the claims, the HTC One (M8) and iPhone 6 were the weakest devices.

They started to deform and bend when a total of 70lbs (31.75kg) of force was applied.

The iPhone 6 Plus came third, at 90lbs (40kg), followed by the LG G3 and iPhone 5 on 130lbs (59kg), and the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 on 150lbs (68kg).

The iPhone 6 Plus results show the handset can withstand 15lbs (6.8kg) more force than the initial reports suggested.

Consumer Reports claimed this is more than a quarter more force than is needed to break three pencils. 

Apple also faced criticism and complaints last week about its iOS 8.0.1 update, after it caused problems with the new phones’ TouchID sensors and data services.

The update was pulled, and the problems should now be solved by updating to iOS 8.0.2.

Following the reports, and #bendgate controversy on Twitter, Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller said: 'With normal use, a bend in iPhone is extremely rare and through our first six days of sale, a total of nine customers have contacted Apple with a bent iPhone 6 Plus,'

Apple shares closed down nearly 4 per cent at $97.87 (£60.26) Thursday, wiping out nearly $23billion (£14.1billion) in market value. 

Further tests, by AnandTech, revealed the performance of the new phones isn’t as poor as customers have made out, either. During initial benchmark tests, the iPhone 6 was found to have the fastest web browsing and page loading times on any device, just ahead of the iPhone 6 Plus (graph pictured)
