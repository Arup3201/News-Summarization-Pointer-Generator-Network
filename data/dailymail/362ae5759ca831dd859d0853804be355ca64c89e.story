Boxing great Mike Tyson is coming to the defense of Toronto's scandal-plagued Mayor Rob Ford.

The ear-biting boxer and crack-smoking politician spent 40 minutes together this afternoon at Toronto City Hall, and afterwards, Tyson seemed to be very impressed with Mayor Ford.

In a rambling exchange with reporters following the meeting, Tyson called his new friend, 'The best mayor in Toronto's history.'

Ford returned to work in June after a stint in rehab for drug and alcohol abuse.

The mayor became an international celebrity last year after he acknowledged using crack in a 'drunken stupor' following months of denials.

The boxer went on to say, 'It's not his fault, it's just that he is living his life and we are human beings — we have no idea what you do behind closed doors.'

Tyson, of course, has had his own problems with the law, having been convicted of rape in 1992.

He also bit the ear of fellow boxer Evander Holyfield in a 1997 match.

He was disqualified from the fight.

For these reasons, many in the crowd were not thrilled to see the former undisputed heavyweight champion at City Hall.

'We’re welcoming a rapist and a wife-beater to city hall with open arms, and he’s banned in the U.K.for those charges,' said protester Carmen Celestini, according to the Toronto Star.

'It’s just not acceptable to me.'  

Tyson is in Toronto for his one-man show Mike Tyson: Undisputed Truth.

When Mayor Ford was asked about the controversy of hosting Tyson, he simply said, 'I’m not going to comment on his personal life.' 

He then added, 'We’re cut from the same cloth. There’s no nonsense. I respect him.'
