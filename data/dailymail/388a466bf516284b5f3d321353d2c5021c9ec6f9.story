Lost battle with cancer: Tory MEP Philip Bradbourn died last night aged 63

David Cameron has led tributes to Tory MEP Philip Bradbourn, who died last night aged 63 after losing his battle with bowel cancer.

The Prime Minister said the West Midlands MEP had a 'truly admirable' dedication to public service and was a 'well-respected' politician.

Mr Bradbourn, who had served in the European Parliament since 1999, was diagnosed with bowel cancer shortly after being re-elected in May and died last night.

Mr Cameron said: 'Philip's dedication to public service was truly admirable - he was a well-respected and effective MEP. 

'In a political career which spanned over four decades, he showed great passion in serving both the party and his constituents. My thoughts are with Philip's family at this sad time.'

Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said: 'Philip was a loyal and dedicated member of the party since he was a teenager, holding a vast variety of local and national positions over many years.

'Born and bred in the Black Country, he took immense pride in championing the West Midlands in his role as member of the European Parliament. 

'He will be sorely missed by his friends and colleagues in the party.'

Mr Bradbourn, who was awarded the OBE in 1994 for his public and political service, had been a town planning officer in local government for more than 20 years before becoming political adviser to the Conservative group on the Wolverhampton City Council.

Ashley Fox, leader of the Conservative MEPs, said Mr Bradbourn was a 'one-off' adding that he was 'a much loved character who could always be relied on for a robust intervention and a succinct summary of a political point'.

He added: 'His no-nonsense approach to politics made him a powerful voice for the West Midlands as well as a resolute defender of the British taxpayers' interests in Brussels and Strasbourg.'

Tribute: The Prime Minister said the West Midlands MEP had a 'truly admirable' dedication to public service and was a 'well-respected' politician

Tory MEP Syed Kamall, chairman of the European Conservatives and Reformists group in the European Parliament, said: 'We are deeply saddened by the news that Philip has passed away.

'Philip was very much a Conservative Party man, giving his life to the service of the country, region and party that he loved.

'Throughout his 15 years as an MEP Philip worked tirelessly to promote his region and to defend Britain's interests.

Outpouring of grief: Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government and Tory politician Eric Pickles posted on Twitter - along with Tory MP for Burton Andrew Griffiths

'We have lost a dedicated colleague.'

In 2008, he won an apology from the now defunct News of the World, which wrongly claimed he used taxpayers’ money to pay for a luxury trip to South Africa.

MPs and fellow European Parliament representatives have taken to Twitter to pay tribute to the long-serving politician.
