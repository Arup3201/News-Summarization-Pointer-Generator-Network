Southern California - particularly Los Angeles - is not ready for a major earthquake, which could devastate as many as 10 million people, an expert has warned.

Speaking at the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, Dr Lucy Jones said when the 'Big One' hits the southern part of state, the damage could be much worse and could endure for much longer than we've previously imagined.

Dr Jones, an adviser for risk reduction at the U.S. Geological Survey, warned that electrical fibers and gas pipes cross the San Andreas fault line, while old water pipes would not withstand the impact.

Warning: Dr Lucy Jones, speaking at the American Geophysical Union in San Francisco, warned that Los Angeles is not prepared for a massive earthquake due to its reliance on technology and old water pipes

The sort of earthquake she was referencing only hits once every 150 to 200 years, CBS Los Angeles warned, but it could leave southern California cut off from the rest of the country.

In her lecture, entitled 'Imagine America without Los Angeles', she said that when a high-magnitude earthquake rocks 
the San Andreas fault, the damage will be much worse than the 1994 Northridge earthquake, which saw collapsed buildings.

Whereas that earthquake affected about a half a million people, today, a huge earthquake on the San Andreas fault could affect 10 million 
Californians, she said.

'Loss of shelter, loss of schools, loss of jobs and emotional hardship. We are risking the ends of our cities,' she said.

Her report pointed out that Los Angeles area supermarkets depend on Internet systems for warehousing and shipping food to stores - but that the food is on the other side of the fault line.

Destruction: A freeway shows damage in the 1994 Northridge earthquake, which affected half a million people. Experts said that a massive earthwuake would now affect up to 10 million people

Impact: Experts worry that a major earthquake along the San Andreas fault line sould cut off Los Angeles and much of Southern California from the rest of the country

'With the development of the Internet and the new just-in-time economy, none of them store food on the Los Angeles side of the San Andreas anymore,' Jones said.

'So this is one more place where the development of the complexity of our modern society is creating new vulnerabilities as we face the big earthquakes.'

Similarly, two thirds of the connectivity between L.A. and other cities travels through fiber-optic cables that cross the fault line, meaning that data capacity would be cut off.

Damage to technology could put back the recovery effort months after the earthquake, she said.

'The World Wide Web wasnâ€™t in existence at the time of the Northridge earthquake,' she said.

'Right now think of how much both your personal life, but also our economic system, depends on having cell phone communications and internet connectivity.'

Cut off: The San Andreas fault line can be seen in relation to San Francisco. Experts said that our reliance on the internet and technology - which would be wiped out - could hinder recovery

Likewise, natural gas pipelines would also be hit, reducing heat and cooking capabilities.

The USGS' 'Shakeout Report' predicts that it could take six months for the broken water pipes to be replaced across Southern California following a quake.

In the Northridge Earthquake in January 1994, 57 people died and more than 8,700 were injured. Property damage was estimated to reach $20 billion, making it one of the most expensive in history.

Its epicenter was the north-central San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, California.

Reliance on technology would make it tough for Californians to get back on their feet if major quake struck on San Andreas fault line

Stores get food from across the fault line and old water pipes, electrical fibers and gas lines would likely be destroyed in a quake

Dr Lucy Jones, who detailed the bleak outlook at the American Geophysical Union, did not suggest when this could happen but earthquakes of such magnitude hit every 150 to 200 years
