Defiant: Piers Morgan declared that he is now looking forward to doing higher profile interviews with bigger names after his live show was axed by CNN

Piers Morgan will end his show in three weeks and at the end of March will temporarily be replaced by a rotating team of hosts Jake Tapper and Bill Weir, announced CNN.

Unfortunately, despite being off to strong start with his show Piers Morgan Live, the British host was never really able to build an American audience.

Morgan said in an interview with The New York Times that he has never really been able to connect with Americans.

'It’s been a painful period, and lately we have taken a bath in the ratings,' Morgan said.

Morgan is also known for disputing the U.S. Constitution, namely the 2nd amendment of the constitution which gives Americans, 'the right to bear arms.'

'Look, I am a British guy debating American cultural issues, including guns, which has been very polarizing, and there is no doubt that there are many in the audience who are tired of me banging on about it,' Morgan said.

'That’s run its course, and Jeff and I have been talking for some time about different ways of using me.'

Breitbart reports that CNN is testing both Jake Tapper and Bill Weir as well as a few other mystery hosts to see if they will be able to build and audience for the hour.

Tapper is a former ABC Senior White House Correspondent and Weir was a former ABC anchor on Nightline.

'Bill Weir was not brought to CNN to replace Piers Morgan,' CNN officials said late last year. Now Weir is simply auditioning for Piers Morgan's place on television.

There have even been rumors that CNN is talking about giving Jay Leno his own evening show.

Piers Morgan has claimed the imminent 
end of his much-vaunted nightly show on CNN will actually allow him to 
do the kind of interviews he always wanted to do on the cable network.

Morgan, who confirmed the axing of his eponymous live show last week after three-years of inconsistent ratings, said that he will be staying on at CNN.

'I’ll make a deal to do 20 to 25 shows a year, all interviews with big names. That’s what I wanted to do in the first place, not reports on snow storms and that kind of thing,' said Morgan in typically forthright fashion.

Indeed, in a sidewalk interview with TMZ, Morgan said that he was relieved his show was over and appeared to imply that some of his daily output through CNN was not substantial enough.

'I'm ready to move on,' Morgan said. 'I want to do big interviews.'

He told TMZ that his favorite shows were the ones where major names like the Dalai Lama, former president Bill Clinton and Oprah were interviewed.

'I came to do the show to do big interviews,' he said.

'I wasn't doing enough. I want to do less shows, more big interviews.'

Three years after taking over from Larry King in the coveted 9pm slot, ratings for Piers Morgan Live have not matched rivals such as Fox News and MSNBC, causing network president Jeffrey Zucker to pull the plug on the British journalist.

The show's ratings have fallen from an audience of two million to around 270,000.

The date of the last show has yet to be decided.

‘It’s been a painful period and lately we have taken a bath in the ratings,’ Morgan, 48, told The New York Times.

CNN's audience has tired of hearing a Brit weigh in on American cultural issues, Morgan said.

During his tenure, he adopted a polarizing stance on controversial topics, in particular on gun control in the wake of the Sandy Hook massacre, where 26 people, including 20 children, were killed.

Morgan said: ‘Look, I am a British guy debating American cultural issues, including guns, which has been very polarising, and there is no doubt that there are many in the audience who are tired of me banging on about it.'

Plans for a replacement are underway, but Morgan and the network are in talks about him remaining on the air in a different role.

‘Jeff and I have been talking for some time about different ways of using me,’ said Morgan, whose contract with the network ends in September.

Morgan made a promising start when his show, previously called Piers Morgan Tonight, aired on CNN on January 17 2011.

His first guest was Oprah Winfrey – and he managed to reduce her to tears.

During points in the interview Oprah teased Morgan, pointing out that she could cry, but wasn't going to.

However, right at the end of their exchange, the 56-year-old broadcaster began to well up as she talked about Martin Luther King.

For his final question, Piers sought Oprah's approval, asking her: 'How did I do?'

And despite Oprah telling Morgan 'you're good' at various points throughout the interview, she chose to describe him as 'surprising' when asked directly.

'Surprisingly bad?' Piers questioned.

'No just surprising. And that's good. Who doesn't want to be surprised?'

Some media critics also warmed to Morgan.

'The premiere of Piers Morgan Tonight revealed host Piers Morgan to be clever, tenacious, vain, a flatterer, and fitfully funny,' said EW.com.

Politico said 'Morgan might be just the solution that CNN needs’ and the Philadelphia Inquirer remarked: 'If [Morgan] shows the judgment, skills and news sense he showed… with the toughest first-night assignment a TV talk-show host ever had, he'll make people forget Larry King even more quickly than they already have.'

However, others weren’t so kind.

One of Morgan’s most difficult shows saw him interview pro-gun campaigner Alex Jones.

Morgan had waded into the gun debate in America, publicly calling for a nationwide ban on military-style semi-automatic weapons.

Radio host and conspiracy theorist Jones responded by organizing a petition to have Morgan deported, which received over 100,000 signatures.

Morgan's world famous interviewees included former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice

Morgan interviewed Jones about gun control shortly afterwards, but Jones spent the majority of the interview shouting at Morgan, often preventing him from expressing his views.

The show ended with Jones yelling: 'Don't try what your ancestors did before'.

Morgan - who has also presented ITV show Life Stories - has said in the past that he believes he is the best at his job in Britain.

He said he rated Michael Parkinson but said he thought he was better than everyone else.

Earlier this month, Morgan - former editor of the Daily Mirror - confirmed he had been questioned over claims of phone hacking.

He was interviewed under caution at the end of last year by officers investigating claims of illegal interception of voicemails by Mirror Group journalists. No arrest was made and it's thought the matter has gone no further.

The Mirror Group was brought into the phone-hacking investigation for the first time in March last year when detectives from Operation Weeting arrested four journalists in dawn raids.
