Hundreds of miners are set to lose their jobs by Christmas as one of Britain's few remaining coal mines looks set to close.

The 540 workers at Maltby pit, near Rotherham, South Yorkshire, have been given 90 day 'potential redundancy' notices by its owners.

Hargreaves Services blames serious geological problems for the closure of the 100-year-old pit, which he says makes mining there dangerous.

Closure: Maltby colliery in South Yorkshire, where 540 redundancies have been announced

There are only around five mines like this one left in the UK - around 30 years ago there were more than 150.

Maltby had been producing more than a million tonnes of coal a year, much of it going to Drax, Europe's largest coal fired power plants.

Last month unusually high levels of water, oil and gas were found at the site and the owners warned about the possible closure.

Painful: Maltby is one of Britain's few remaining mines and the local community has expressed its sorrow at the decision

Difficult: More than 500 miners at the colliery could lose their jobs by Christmas

Mike O'Sullivan, from Hargreaves Services, said: 'We have got reports that will be coming to us in a number of weeks which will advise us on all the various risk profiles associated with the geological problems and it's only when our board is in full possession of all the data that any decision will be properly made.'

A statement from the company added: 'Initiating this process is considered to be 
prudent business practice and does not indicate that a decision on the 
future of Maltby has been taken. The relevant Government department is 
being notified.

'The Board of Hargreaves still expects to receive reports later in 
October that will advise on the geological, financial and health and 
safety risks. The decision by the Board on the future of the colliery 
will be based on the conclusions of these reports.'

Local people are distressed at the news.

Chairman of Maltby Town Council John Carrat said : 'I'm absolutely gutted. I've heard this news and I can't believe they're going to close the colliery.

'When Hargreaves had a similar problem three years ago they had faith in the workforce to get through, and since Hargreaves took over at Maltby Colliery they've made a profit every year.

'Last year they made Â£34m worth of profit, so I think it's time Hargreaves gave the workforce down at Maltby Colliery some support.'

As owners of the historic Maltby pit issued redundancy notices to its 
540 miners today, the South Yorkshire colliery is one in a very long line to 
close in recent years.

The last three decades have seen an incredible decline in numbers, with hundreds of mines running before the infamous miners' strike of the 1980s.

Despite union leaders claiming victory and saving some mines, the industrial action was followed by pit closure after pit closure.

Ten deaths were linked to the strike: six picketers, three 
teenagers searching for coal, and a taxi driver taking a non-striking 
miner to work.

After the year-long action ended some 156 alone have been shut, and in 1985 at least 25 were closed including Cortonwood - the Yorkshire pit where the strike actually began (pictured above right)

Within seven years nearly a hundred had gone forever and now there are only around 5 deep pits with a small number of shallow mines.

Many closed were filled with concrete, turned into museums or left because owners believed that they could be re-opened - but most never did.

Engineer Bob Matthews who was the last person out of Cotgrave colliery in Nottinghamshire when it closed in 1993 said simply: 'When a pit is shut it's shut for good.

'It was a bit sad being the last men out of there but the worst part was when the time came to switch off the fans,' he told the BBC.

'Everything just fell silent and that's when I knew it was absolutely dead.'
