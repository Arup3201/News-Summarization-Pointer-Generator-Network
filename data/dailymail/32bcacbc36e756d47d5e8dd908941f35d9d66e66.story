With a little help 
from Barbara Walters, one of Syrian President Bashar al-Assads close 
aides was admitted into Columbia University's prestigious international 
affairs program.

In a string of leaked emails between Sheherazad Jafaari
and the celebrated broadcaster, Ms Walters, 82, promised to her help 
the 22-year-old secure a job on Piers Morgan's CNN show and win a place 
at Columbia University. Apparently only Columbia took the bait.

'Ms. Jaafari was admitted based 
solely on the submitted application materials,' associate Columbia dean 
Jesse Gale said in response to the controversy surrounding her 
acceptance.

Ms Jafaari, whose father is Syria's 
U.N. ambassador, was one of Assad's closest advisers and one one of 
three women revealed in an earlier leak to have sent lovestruck emails 
to the dictator.

Walters grew close to President Assad's aide Sheherazad Jaafari while organizing the interview, and later emailed contacts at CNN and Columbia University to help her comely new friend

Making headlines: Barbara Walters was the first and only American journalist to interview Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in December in the midst of violent uprisings in his country that have left thousands dead

In one email, Ms Walters told 'Sherry' 
how she had written to CNN host Piers Morgan and his top producer to 
'say how terrific you are' in hopes of helping her get a job at Piers 
Morgan Tonight.

The young woman responded, writing 'You can never be a better mom to your adopted child (me).'

Messages leaked by Syrian rebels in March show her asking another of Mr Assad's advisers to tell him: 'I love him so so so much and that I miss him.'

The leak revealed flirtatious and suggestive emails from three admirers, including a provocative photograph of an unknown woman in white lingerie.

Mrs Walters first met Ms Jaafari when the young woman's father hosted a cocktail party in his New York apartment in March 2011.

'(Ms Jaafari) was bragging that they 
had a great relationship after she came to her house for a cocktail 
party,' a diplomatic source told the newspaper.

The New York Post reports that the two women bonded that evening, and an unidentified diplomatic source said that the then-21-year-old 'was bragging that they had a great relationship after she came to her house for a cocktail party'.

That connection came in handy when 
the veteran reporter began dealing with Ms Jaafari on a regular basis 
leading up the ABC News' exclusive televised interview with the Syrian 
leader.

In the interview, Ms Walters pressed 
the president about the thousands of deaths of Syrian citizens and he 
denied having issued any formal command for such force.

Ms Walters and Jaafari continued to talk via email long after the interview aired

The Telegraph,
who published the most recent batch of hacked emails between Ms Walters
and Ms Jaafari, reported that the interview was received poorly by 
Syrian government officials because it ended up being more harsh on 
Assad than they originally expected.

Shortly after, Ms Jaafari emailed Ms Walters in a panic, writing that she was 'in so much trouble' over the interview.

A
few weeks  later, Ms Jaafari had determined that it was time for her to
get out of Syria and join her father in the U.S.- all the while 
remaining extremely loyal to Assad, who she called 'the Dude'. In other 
emails obtained by The Guardian in March, Ms Jaafari wrote that 'this man is loved by his people'.

Upon her move from Syria, Ms Jaafari 
applied to Columbia University's School of International and Public 
Affairs, and hope to translate her time working as a press aide to Assad
into a staff position at a major American news outlet.

Ms Walters immediately dismissed any 
talk of her working for ABC since it would be a breach of journalistic 
ethics. Instead, she offered to reach out on behalf of the 'dear girl'.

Walters signed emails 'hugs' and 'love'

The pair appear extremely close, with 
Ms Walters signing her emails with ‘hugs’ and ‘love’ and Ms Jaafari 
promising to bring back jewellery from Syria for her so-called adoptive 
mother.

Their email exchange was obtained by Syrian opposition forces who then passed them on to The Telegraph.

Ms Walters emailed Columbia Journalism
School professor Richard Wald, former president of NBC News and vice 
president of ABC News, to sing Ms Jaafari's praises.

'She is brilliant, beautiful, speaks five languages. Anything you can do to help?' Ms Walters wrote at the end of January.

Mr
Wald responded that while his position at the Journalism School is 
unconnected to the School of International and Public Affairs, he would 
do his best to help, saying that 'through the Admissions Office network,
I will get them to give her special attention. I am sure they will take
her.'

Now Columbia is saying that while she was accepted, Mr Wald's intervention- if any- had nothing to do with it.

'We cannot comment on an individual applicant’s materials, which are confidential,' Ms Gale said.

Mr Wald's son, Jonathan Wald, is the 
executive producer of Piers Morgan Tonight, was also the recipient of an
email from Ms Walters.

She
told Ms Jaafari that she wrote to both Jonathan Wald and Piers Morgan 
on her behalf and passed along her resume for their consideration, even 
though she was unsure if they had any availability. That specific email 
was not released.

Neither Ms Walters nor Ms Jaafari heard back from CNN or the younger Mr Wald.

In the wake of the emails, Ms Walters released a statement expressing her 'regret' for the questionable decision.

'In
the aftermath (of the Assad interview), Ms Jaafari returned to the US 
and contacted me looking for a job. I told her that was a serious 
conflict of interest and that we would not hire her,' Ms Walters said in
the statement. 

During her initial response to the 
allegations, Ms Walters did not know that the young woman had, in fact, 
been accepted to the program, but she still expressed her regret.

'I did offer to mention her to 
contacts at another media organisation and in academia, though she 
didn't get a job or into school. In retrospect, I realise that this 
created a conflict and I regret that.'
