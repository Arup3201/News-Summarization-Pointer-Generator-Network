South Korean president Park Geun-hye fired her press secretary this week after he was accused of sexually assaulting a young female Korean employee of the nation's embassy in a downtown Washington, D.C. hotel after drinking late into the evening on Tuesday night.

The former spokesman, Yoon Chang-jung, was sent back to Seoul on Wednesday, while President Park and the rest of her delegation continued from Washington to Los Angeles.

Korea's Yonhap News Agency, which first reported on Yoon's dismissal, obtained a copy of a report from the Washington Metropolitan Police Department which said the suspect 'grabbed her buttocks without her permission' between 9:30 and 10:00 p.m. Tuesday.

The Chosun Ilbo daily newspaper reported Friday morning that the alleged victim felt 'shame and humiliation' and called the police, but no arrest was made.

Yoon Chang-jung, a now-former spokesman for South Korean President Park Geun-hye, was fired after he allegedly groped a female intern after a night of drinking at a Washington, D.C. hotel

South Korean President Park Geun-hye, the country's so-called 'Iron Lady' is the first woman to be elected to her nation's top government position, a circumstance that will bring even greater scrutiny on her spokesman, who was accused of sexual assault

While the police report Yonhap obtained did not include Yoon's name, a department spokesperson was responding to a request for information about a sexual assault involving a Korean official. The request specifically named 'Yoon Chang-jung.'

Park, South Korea's first female president, was in the U.S. capital for a series of meetings and public appearances with President Barack Obama and other senior officials.

Lee Nam-ki, a more senior presidential spokesman, confirmed Thursday during a briefing that a 'decision was made since it was determined that Yoon showed inappropriate conduct as a high-ranking official and 
harmed the dignity of the nation by being personally involved in a disgraceful 
event while accompanying President Park in her U.S. visit.'

Other English translations rendered Lee's comments differently, addressing 'an unsavory incident.'

While President Park met with California Gov. Jerry Brown (L) and Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa (R), press secretary Yoon Chang-jung was headed back to Seoul from Washington, alone and disgraced

Park Geun-hye met with Barack Obama in the Oval Office of the WHite House on Tuesday, just hours before her press aide allegedly groped a young female following a night of drinking

A spokeswoman for the Washington Metropolitan Police Department said that MPD was 'investigating the report of a misdemeanor sexual abuse' but 'cannot comment further.'

She did not immediately respond to a request for information about whether the Korean embassy had invoked diplomatic immunity on Yoon's behalf.

Yonhap noted that critics from the opposition Democratic Party had accused Yoon of being unfit for presidential spokesman duty. A former political columnist, he worked for Park's transition team before joining her administration and was known for a confrontational and provocative writing style as a journalist.

Several other nominees to top posts in the Park government have withdrawn their names from consideration in connection with ethics scandals, including some allegations of tax evasion and unethical real estate speculation.

South Korea's embassy in Washington (L) was home-base for the extended summit between Park and Obama, leading the embassy to hire temporary staff - including the alleged young female victim. Park's visit to Washington culminated with an address before a special joint session of Congress

Yoon's alleged victim is reportedly a Korean-American in her 20s who was hired on a temporary basis to assist the embassy with Park's visit.

Kim Kwan-young, the principal spokesman for Korea's Democratic Party, publicly asked President Park on Friday for a formal apology. She and her administration 'should deeply reflect on their appointment of the wrong personnel and apologize to the people,' Kim said.

Park's Saenuri Party expressed 'regret.'

'I hope that the mistake of one individual does not cloud all the achievements of President Park's visit to the United States," said Saenuri spokeswoman Rep. Min Hyun-joo
