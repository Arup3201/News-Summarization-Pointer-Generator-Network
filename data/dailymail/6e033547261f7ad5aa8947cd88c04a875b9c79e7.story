Any Seahawks fans worth his blue and green was hit hard by Seattle's spectacular Super Bowl loss on Sunday, but one superfan hit back by smashing his big screen TV.

Video has emerged of a man so overtaken by rage following coach Pete Carroll's already infamous call in the final moments of the game that he bum-rushes his own television set.

'You do not throw a pass at the goal line when you have Marshawn Lynch,' the irate fan grumbles--referring to Seattle's running back--before breaking into a run of his own. 

'You do not throw a pass at the goal line when you have Marshawn Lynch!': This Seattle superfan was so enraged by the Seahawks Super Bowl-losing final play that he broke into a run toward his TV

Flying leap: Friends stood by as the infuriated fan made a flying leap toward his television

The man's friends look on as his head then goes through the projection-style set's giant technicolor screen, which somehow stays illuminated as it caves totally in.

Still not satisfied, the man bounces back and lands a few punches onto the screen.

No one in the dimly lit room comes to the angry man's side, preferring instead to let the spectacle unfold.

When the punches fail to calm his furor, the man goes all in: he tips over the TV, letting it smash to the carpeted floor with a thud.

While the television was undoubtedly destroyed, some viewers have questioned whether the man vs. TV mashup was also a setup.

'Obviously fake, but still absolutely hilarious!' wrote YouTube user Chubzdoomer.

YouTube user Kenrick Eason agreed:

'Even though this is fake it was the reaction of millions!!! Even Patriot fans was like WTF!! Who call pass at the goal line on 2nd down with one time out left!!' he said. 

Built them better then: Even after the man's bum-rush, the television remained illuminated...and the man remained infuriated

Sealed its fate: In a final vengeful act, the man tips his TV over to the carpet floor with a thud

Vanquished: With the television gone, the man will no longer have to be reminded of Sunday's spectacular loss, save for his newfound internet stardom and the years of debate over Coach Carroll's last second play
