The estranged father of Home Alone star Macaulay Culkin faces the prospect of never seeing his famous son again - and spends his time watching the former child star's films as he recovers from a debilitating stroke.

Kit Culkin, 70, a former actor, suffered a stroke in January which left him unable to speak or use his writing hand.

And speaking exclusively to DailyMail.com, Kit's step daughter, Thalia Baker Fuchs reveals how he is desperate to reconnect with his six children, but has to resort to watching movies they star in.

She said: 'He tells stories about his kids, of course, like any father would. He’s proud of them.'

The 70-year-old former actor became estranged from his seven children over his split from their mother, Patricia Brentrup, in 1995 - and has not been a part of their lives since.

Sad: Thalia Baker Fuchs said she hopes Kit Culkin will one day be reunited with his six children 

The only way he gets to see his loved ones is by watching their movies and Thalia says Home Alone, which stars Macaulay as Kevin McCallister, a boy accidentally left at home when his family take a Christmas vacation to Paris, is still one of his favorites.

She said:'He likes to watch his family’s movies, Home Alone comes on all the time, especially at Christmas, he watches that and Uncle Buck.'

Kit has spent the past year recovering from a stroke. He has been plagued by bad health since the beginning of the year, when a piece of plaque from an artery in his neck broke off and traveled to his brain while he was cooking dinner at his home in Oregon.

Thalia was the only one to fly up to be with him and help comfort her mother, who has been his partner for almost twenty years, and who is also suffering memory loss, thought to be the early stages of dementia.

When asked if any of his children – Shane, 38, Macaulay, 34, Kieran, 32, Quinn, 30, Christian, 27 and Rory, 25 - had been in contact with her or made an effort to come and see their father, Thalia  shook her head sadly.

She said: 'I don’t want to get involved in that part, it’s between Kit and his kids. I’m hoping that they’ll reconnect soon.

'You’d think that by now they would have their own eyes. Kit tells stories about his kids, of course, like any father would. He’s proud of them.

'I’m very family oriented, so it’s very hard for me to understand that side of things, I can’t comprehend it.'

The way they were: Macaulay Culkin as a child actor and dad Kit before they became estranged

Once a doting dad: Kit Culkin and a young Mac: They became estranged when Mac was caught in a bitter custody battle between Kit and his former wife Patricia.  Mac ended up divorcing his parents aged 14

After he was discharged from hospital, Kit and Jeanette went to live with Thalia and her family in their modest home on the outskirts of Phoenix, Arizona while on the road to recovery.

Thalia revealed: 'He’s had to learn everything all over again, like speaking and writing. He’s a big writer and he couldn't even grip a pen.

'He couldn't speak for a while or use his hand.

'For a little bit I felt all alone taking care of him and Jeanette, I was like, ‘What am I supposed to do? I have three kids, a husband, two dogs. And they have two dogs too.’ it was a lot to take in.'

Speaking about Kit's kids, Thalia declared: 'All he did was make them a bunch of money, but it wasn’t even about the money. It was the custody battle and the mother being controlling.”

While Thalia says she thinks a reconciliation will happen between Kit and at least some of his children, she is certain the last person to make up with his father will be Macaulay.

'Mac would be the last to reconcile with him,' she said.

Macaulay was managed by his parents from the start of his career when he was just four until 1995 when they split and he 'retired', aged 14.

By that time he had earned an estimated $50 million, which had largely been put into a trust fund, with 15 per cent paid to his managers. A huge legal battle between Kit and Patricia ensued over both custody of Macaulay and his fortune, which ended up with him ‘divorcing’ his parents.

After the bitter fight was over Kit, a highly charged character, appeared to accept defeat. While Patricia and his children stayed in New York, he retreated to the West Coast and started over again with Jeanette, who he had known since the 1970s.

A former actor himself, Kit let his once dark hair go grey and long and complemented it with a large beard as he settled into small town life in Oregon, thousands of miles away from the bright spotlights and fast pace of New York.

Thalia claims that Kit - known in the 1990s for his hard-nosed business tactics - is in fact, now humble, and quickly dismisses the question of whether his family helped with medical bills, saying: 'He’s not had a penny from his family, ever. He and Jeanette are retired so they’re on social security, and that’s it. They live like normal people.

Thalia claims that one of the most heart-breaking things for Kit, who has made a good recovery, is not being in contact with his daughter, Quinn, following the death of his other daughter Dakota after she was struck by a car in 2008.

She said: 'I know he really wants to speak to his daughter. He was heartbroken over Dakota.'

She added the warning: 'Family is everything and he’s not going to be around forever. They’ll regret it when it’s too late.'

When asked if Kit would appreciate Macaulay’s joke band, The Pizza Underground, Thalia thinks it unlikely, although she ‘likes’ the group herself on Facebook and finds them funny. She says she would even consider approaching Macaulay at one of his shows in an attempt to reunite him with his father.

She said: 'The band, it was kinda funny and kind of stupid, maybe there’s a reason he did that, I don’t know. I would go and see them. I would probably introduce myself to him. Maybe I could persuade him [to get in contact with Kit], but I doubt it.

'Kit wouldn’t want to see them, he wouldn’t like that type of music. He doesn’t even like it when I put my music on in the car.'

Admitting she may face the ire of the fiercely private Culkin family for speaking out, Thalia said she did not care as she was one of the few people to care for Kit.

After a few months of recuperation, Kit left to stay with his sister, Die Hard actress Bonnie, 66, in California on his own, but Jeanette'“couldn’t handle being apart' from him so they rented a small house close to Bonnie’s so she could look after them and take them to medical appointments.

Thalia added: 'Kit is 95 per cent better. He’s able to talk for the most part now. He can drive again and he can cook, which he loves to do.

'Bonnie is wonderful, she’s really been a big help with him, doing therapy and getting him hooked up with doctors, him and Jeanette.

'I have the best relationship with them, Kit is basically my stepdad. They’ve always been really nice to me, that’s why I’ve never understood all the things people have said about Kit, he’s just a wonderful, kind, generous guy.'

Kit’s recovery means he is now able to continue caring for Jeanette and they are hoping to return to normal life in Oregon. It has also given his family another chance to make amends and hopefully this Christmas he can have more of a connection to his most successful son than simply seeing him as he was 24 years ago in Home Alone.
