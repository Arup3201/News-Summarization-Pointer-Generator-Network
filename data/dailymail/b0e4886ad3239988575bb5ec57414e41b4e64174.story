Crouching in the depths of a pitch-black Costa Rican cave, a wildlife photographer has managed to capture images of extraordinary colour.

These pictures capture moments that are almost impossible to see with the naked eye, and show birds, bats, frogs and even mice mid-flight, fleeing, feeding and interacting with each other.

The shots were taken by Nicolas Reusens, 38, who spent hours crouched in caves - often up to his knees in water - waiting for the perfect moments to snap these amazing images.

Stretching out: A brightly-coloured frog takes a giant jump, leaving its body at full-stretch as it soars through the blackness

A kiss in flight: Two hummingbirds get close as they hover in the air - their green feathers glimmering against the darkness of the cave

Sweet treat: A bat sucks at the juice in this plant with its tongue in an image you could almost never see with the naked eye

I believe I can fly: A tiny mouse soars through the air as it leaps from one branch to another, snapped mid-flight by photographer Nicolas Reusens

He said: 'I knew what kind of shots I wanted to get, but it required a great deal of patience to get them.

'When I finally looked at my set, I felt as though I had won the lottery.

'I had to study each animal and their behaviours to determine how best to take each photo.

Hovering hummingbirds: These colourful creatures suspend themselves in mid-air, their green, blue and purple feathers catching the light for the camera 

'There are two ways to shoot, either manually, by waiting and knowing exactly the feeding locations of each specimen, or automatically with specialised gear that automated the camera shooting when an invisible barrier is trespassed.

'Both systems require tonnes of patience and time. First to locate the perfect location for the camera and flashes, then also time to fine tune on the possible subjects in order to get them nicely focused.

'The barrier triggers the camera and the flashes so all the previous efforts of gear collocation and focus will be of great importance.

Taking a lick: A bat flicks out its long tongue as it nears a tasty-looking red and orange fruit, its leathery wings guiding it towards the prize

Biding time: Mr Reusens says capturing these images takes a huge amount of patience, first to find the right spot and second to wait for the perfect moment

Flash photography: The camera's flash is vital as it is what picks out these vivid colours from an otherwise deep and dark night sky

Like an angel: A beautiful purple hummingbird spreads its wings as spots of light artistically glint across the camera lens 

'In order to take one shot I had to stay under rain for two hours placing the camera and flashes, and then wait another hour more in order to get one of the frogs jumping exactly from the branch I had placed right next to the pond.

'Bats are very difficult to get to at first, but when you get the focus in the sweet spot it's just a game of waiting and good luck.

'The more bats the easier to get one in focus. I had to enter a cave with water to my knees for 20 minutes, mount my gear, and wait for one hour until the first bat came out. It was pretty hard because I was inside a cave with the only light that comes from your headlamp, humidity and your precious gear only few centimetres from the water.

'If I do my homework correctly I get shots never seen before, this makes me proud and gives me more stamina to keep shooting and thinking of new adventures elsewhere.' 

Unique: Mr Reusens says that if he does his homework correctly he gets shots the likes of which have never been seen before

Perfect shot: Mr Reusens says bats are very difficult to get to at first, but when you get the focus in the sweet spot it is just a game of waiting and good luck

Dank and dark: The photographer had to wade through knee-deep water in pitch black caves in order to get some of the amazing shots

You're the one that I want: A bat spots a delicate pink flower from which it can satisfy its hunger by sucking out some sweet nectar

Show off: This bright green hummingbird does tricks in the air, almost as if it is playing up to Mr Reusens and his camera
