They came for the Fernando Torres dream debut, they gladly settled for the Sergio Ramos nightmare. The Atletico Madrid striker did not score on his return to the Vicente Calderon but a senseless foul in the area from Ramos gave Raul Garcia the perfect chance to score from the spot and give his side the first leg advantage.

Jose Gimenez then rose to head a Gabi corner home doubling Atletico’s first-leg lead in this last-16 Copa del Rey match and deal Real Madrid their second defeat in four days.

Ramos, so often worthy of ‘world’s best defender’ tag, had one of his incomprehensible lapses dragging down Raul Garcia in front of referee Carlos Clos on 58 minutes and Raul Garcia scored from the spot.

Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti brought on the rested Cristiano Ronaldo but he could not rescue Real who conceded again from a corner and could now be heading out of the cup at their hands of their City neighbours having already lost to them in the league and in the Spanish Super Cup this season.

They will need a big result next Thursday in the Santiago Bernabeu and Ronaldo will surely start after watching the first half of the first leg from the bench. He saw Real Madrid almost take the lead in the first minute when Ramos got his head to a James Rodriguez corner but headed straight at Jan Oblak.

It was Real’s last clear-cut chance of the first half as Gareth Bale endured a frustrating night and Ronaldo was sorely missed alongside him.

For Atletico, Torres was full of running and the Calderon roared every time he touched the ball. He was too keen on several occasions racing clear into an offside position as Real’s central defensive partnership of Rafael Varane and Ramos played with a high line despite ‘El Nino’s’ presence and the lightning pace of his strike partner Antoine Greizmann.

It was the Frenchman who gave Atletico their first scare when he robbed Varane. As he honed in on goal his France World Cup team-mate Varane recovered brilliant and slid in to dispossess him clearing for a corner.

Torres was kicked by Khedira and the German was booked. But the debutant might have gone into the book himself after clashing with Marcelo under the nose of the linesman. He shouted down the same linesman when the flag was raised for another offside. He was as animated as the 46,800 inside willing him to return with a goal.

The second half started with Real going close first through James Rodriguez wrongly flagged offside receiving the ball on the edge of the six-yard box and then with Bale running onto a long cross field pass from Marcelo but trying to pass it into the far corner of Oblak’s net and sending it just wide.

Griezmann went close again for Atletico and then came Ramos’ moment of madness pulling down Raul Garcia from behind and leaving referee Carlos Clos Gomez with no choice but to point to the spot.

It might have been Torres’ magic moment but instead Raul Garcia stepped up and with almost no run up rifled the spot-kick past Navas. The Calderon erupted, and Diego Simeone’s youngest son Giuliano jumped into his arms to celebrate. In the pandemonium the Argentine coach brought on Koke for Torres.

The former Liverpool and Chelsea striker had toiled for an hour. He hadn’t scored but he helped create the atmosphere that now looked like carrying Atletico Madrid over the line.   

Carlo Ancelotti responded by bringing on Ronaldo but a mishit free-kick was the closest he came and with 15 minutes left Giminez rose to make it two and Simeone’s son was back in Simeone’s arms. It was a night for favourite returning sons and for another famous win for Atletico over their neighbours Real Madrid. 

It was the first time Torres had ever beaten Real Madrid as an Atletico Madrid player and he said: 'There was plenty to celebrate. The atmosphere was great and so was the performance but we know that taking a 2-0 to the Bernabeu is not enough to mean the tie is over. We will have to play just as well there to finish the job.'
