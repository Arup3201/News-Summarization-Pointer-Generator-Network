It was a disappointing night for the Democratic Republic of Congo’s Premier League stars, as both Yussouf Mulumbu and Yannick Bolasie were subbed off in a 0-0 draw against Cape Verde.

Congo captain Mulumbu seemed to damage his hamstring in the 15th minute, and despite attempting to continue, he was stretchered off six minutes later.

Bolasie, so superb in a man of the match display on Sunday against Zambia, was practically anonymous.

Cape Verde Islands: Vozinha, Carlitos, Fernando Varela, Stopira, Gege, Rocha, Lima, Babanco, Kuca (Almeida Ramos), Ryan Mendes (Fortes, 73), Tavares (Almada Soares, 79).

Congo DR: Kidiaba, Mongongu, Kimwaki, Kasusula, Issama, Mbemba, Mulumbu (Munganga, 23), Mabidi (Mubele, 86), Cedrick, Bolasie (Bokila, 63), Mbokani.

Having been unlucky to only pick up a point in their first game, the Congolese side were surprisingly off the pace against the competition’s smallest country, failing to get their dangerous attacking players into the game.

Bolasie briefly burst to life in stoppage time at the end of the first half, running at the Cape Verde defence before driving a shot from the edge of the box which was saved, relatively comfortably, by Josimar Dias.

It was his only meaningful contribution in a thoroughly disappointing performance, which was cut short soon after when the winger replaced after an hour.

The result leaves both sides knowing a win in their final game will guarantee progress to the knockout stages, but anything less could see them crash out.

The Leopards were indebted to their keeper  Robert Kidiaba to even get away with a point. The 38-year-old made a superb double save five minutes from time following a corner, and another stunning stop two minutes later to deny substitute Heldon Ramos.

The closest Congo came to a goal was when the Blue Sharks’ centre back Gege almost beat his own keeper with a back-header, but Josimar reacted just in time to stop the ball going over the line.

Cape Verde, on the other hand, appeared to have taken confidence from holding Tunisia in their opener, and showed the greater invention.

Estoril forward Kuca was a particular threat, using his pace to get in behind the Leopards defence several times. 

On one such occasion the speedster should really have scored, but having beaten the offside trap he took far too many touches before getting his shot away, and eventually wasted the chance.

The Blue Sharks were, as ever, most dangerous from set pieces, and they should have gone ahead from one on the half-hour mark.

A dangerous ball in from the left hand side found Calu Lima, attacking the ball uncontested from seven yards, but he headed straight at Kidiaba in the Congolese goal.

Centre back Fernando Varela and striker Julio Tavares also had excellent chances in the first half, but neither could convert.
