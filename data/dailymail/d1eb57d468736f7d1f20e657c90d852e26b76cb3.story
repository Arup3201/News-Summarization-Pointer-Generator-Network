A shocking photograph has emerged showing a team of Indian doctors carrying out a sterilisation on a woman using a foot pump designed for a bicycle.

Surgeons at a sterilisation camp in the village of Banarpal in Odisha state are understood to have used the device to inflate the abdomen of 56 women to make it easier to carry out the operation.

The image emerged just two weeks after 13 women died in a mass sterilisation in neighbouring Chhattisgarh state, where local officials admitted the equipment used by the doctor who carried out the tubectomies had been rusty, and the medicine they were given contaminated.

Shocking: Surgeons at a sterilisation camp in the village of Banarpal in Odisha state are understood to have used the device to inflate the abdomen of 56 women to make it easier to carry out the operation

The photograph of doctors using a bicycle pump to inflate the woman's abdomen was reportedly taken at a sterilisation camp in Banarpal village, in the Angul district of Odisha state.

Local officials reportedly admitted that the crude technique had been used in a total of 56 tubectomies over the course of the day, according to the Hindustan Times.

The newspaper said the doctor who carried out the operations, Mahesh Prasad Rout, told them that the use of a bicycle pump to inflate the abdomen was commonplace in remote parts of India.

'Bicycle pumps are used frequently during sterilisation in camps in rural areas that lack sophisticated surgical equipment used for inflating the abdomen,' Rout was quoted as saying.

Local medical officials said they were looking into the incident and will submit a report this week.  

Tragedy: The bicycle pump photograph emerged after 13 women died and dozens left in hospital after a state-run mass sterilisation in India, which was carried out with rusty instruments and contaminated medicines

 Typically proper medical equipment is used to inflate a woman's abdomen before a tubectomy takes place. The equipment regulates the inflation rate to ensure the pressure generated is steady and safe.

Although Rout - who has performed over 60,000 tubectomies in his 10-year, award-winning career - insisted the bicycle pump was sterilised before being placed inside the woman, the potential for human error, violent expansion and an over-inflated stomach makes the practice dangerous.

Last week the doctor responsible for the mass-sterilisation Chhattisgarh state which left 13 women dead and dozens hospitalised was accused of using rusty instruments to perform the operations.

R.K. Gupta, allegedly carried out 83 tubectomies in just three hours at a state-run 'family planning camp' on November 8. 

The majority of the women fell ill shortly after their operation, with local government officials saying the equipment used was rusty and the medicines provided to the women contaminated.

The cause of the deaths was not immediately clear, but officials said the victims showed signs of toxic shock, possibly due to the use of dirty surgical equipment or contaminated medicines.
