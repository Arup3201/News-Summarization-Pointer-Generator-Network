Rosalind Cormack, of Bristol, is facing jail after RSPCA officers found eight dead pets at her home after she left the animals unattended

A woman is facing jail today after leaving her pets to die in disgusting conditions - and they were only found after neighbours complained about the smell of a dead cat in a wheelie bin.

The RSPCA visited the home of Rosalind Cormack, of Knowle, Bristol, on three consecutive days after complaints from neighbours about the smell and flies, but she was never in.

Police eventually broke into the house after RSPCA officers found a dead cat in a wheelie bin.

On entering the property they were hit by an 'unbearable stench' and discovered seven other dead pets, including three cats, a dog, two rabbits and a hamster littered around the property.

Officers also found a further eight cats alive but in an emaciated state.

Widowed Cormack, 58, had been away for up to three weeks when officers raided the house in July.

She pleaded guilty this week to one count of causing unnecessary suffering to a cat called Mi Mi, not providing a suitable environment for a further eight cats, all of which were alive on discovery, or for three cats which had died.

Charges for the cat in the wheelie bin, dog, rabbit and hamster were not brought. 

Some of the cats that survived later had to be put down due to their condition.

Cormack was told magistrates would adjourn for a full pre-sentence report but a prison sentence of up to 12 weeks is possible.

Lindi Meyer, prosecuting on behalf of the RSPCA, described how the unbearable stench of rotting flesh meant the inspector could not breathe through his nose.

The court heard a visiting animal welfare officer had also seen evidence of cats trying to get out of the property but had been unable to contact Cormack.

Cormack had been away from the property for between seven days and three weeks.

Ms Meyer said: 'When police forced entry to the premises there was a very strong smell of faeces, with one officer saying it was unbearable and he could not breathe through his nose.

'There were flies everywhere and the officer said the state of the house meant it was impossible to walk through the lounge without treading in faeces.'

She went on to describe the 'horrendous' smell of rotting flesh when officers found the maggot-riddled and decomposing body of the dog in the kitchen with a live cat, Mi Mi.

The dead animals included three cats, a dog, two rabbits and a hamster littered around the property

A decomposing kitten was found on the stairs as well as another that was found in a basket. 

A dead hamster was found in the bedroom and two dead rabbits in their cage in the garden.

Ms Meyer added: 'In interview she said the dog had been dead for three to four weeks and the hamster and rabbits for some time.

'She said the three cats had been alive when she had left. 

'She said things had got on top of her and that she was suffering from depression.'

Ms Meyer told magistrates she would be seeking to have a lifelong ban on owning any animals imposed on Cormack.

Cormack does not have any previous convictions. 

Sentencing has been adjourned until next month.
