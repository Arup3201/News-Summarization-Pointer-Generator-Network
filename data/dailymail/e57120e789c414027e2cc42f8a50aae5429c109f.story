Chancellor George Osborne, who was out jogging in Westminster today, has defended the rise 1 per cent rise in benefits, saying welfare handouts had risen at twice the rate of wages

Liberal Democrats are to hold talks on voting against a cap on welfare rises, branding them a ‘horrible thing to do’.

Backbench MPs claim they are ‘distressed’ that leader Nick Clegg signed up a below-inflation 1 per cent rise in benefits in each of the next three years.

The Labour party is also suggesting it will try to block the move, which Chancellor George Osborne said was needed after benefits rose at twice the rate of average wages.

The Coalition hopes to save £4.4billion a
year through the cap on working-age benefits announced last week by 
Chancellor George Osborne. Tory sources say the amount is equal to 1p a 
year on basic income tax.

But some Lib Dem MPs are considering voting against the measure, and plan to voice their opposition this week.

Cheltenham MP Martin Horwood attacked Tories who sound 'pleased' about cutting benefits.

'I mean they seem to be hitting some of the most vulnerable people in this country.

'The remaining real-terms cut in benefits is a very painful thing to swallow and it's a difficult thing for us to swallow politically but much more difficult for people to cope with who are actually struggling to live on a very small amount of money each week,' he told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour.

Asked if he would vote against the cap when legislation is drawn up in the new year, he replied: 'I
would like to talk to Liberal Democrat colleagues about this but I am 
very unhappy about it. I'm not happy about some of the welfare cuts at 
all.'

Fellow Lib Dem MP Stephen Gilbert also said he was 'distressed' by the 1 per cent rise, and attacked 'loose language' from Tories who wanted to curb state handouts.

Meanwhile Labour has given the clearest indication yet that it will block a cap on welfare handouts, saying that it will ‘struggle’ to support the plan.

Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna fears a below-inflation 1 per cent rise in benefits in each of the next three years will increase child poverty and harm lower-income families.

‘Unless fundamental changes are made to the proposals that we’ve seen so far I think we will struggle to support this,’ he said.

Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna said Labour would 'struggle' to support the cap unless changes are made

'The Chancellor is seeking to set up a debate between the so-called strivers on the one hand and people in receipt of benefits on the other, whilst totally and wilfully ignoring the fact that many people who are on benefit are actually in work.

'Six out of ten households that are going to be affected by the cuts that have been announced this week are working households, so to set this up in this way is completely reprehensible because many people who are on benefits and working are striving.'

The move will dismay the few Blairites left on Labour’s front line, because it risks suggesting to voters that the party is in denial over the need to cut the size of the welfare state.

Free bus travel will be offered to  more than 800,000 unemployed people in an attempt to get them to find a jobs.

Anyone who has been out of work for between three months and a year will be eligible for the Britain-wide scheme

Transport minister Norman Baker said: 'Good bus services play a huge role in boosting economic growth by helping people to access employment and training opportunities.

'I have been encouraging bus operators to look at the fare deals they can offer to young people looking for work, so I congratulate the operators that are doing so in January and look forward to seeing other offers in the future.'

The scheme has been organised by a coalition of transport bodies. Claimants will need to hold a JobCentre Plus Travel Discount Card, which already entitles them to half-price journeys.

Arriva,
First, Go-Ahead, National Express and Stagecoach are among the 
operators signed up to the deal, which covers 70% of routes in England, 
Wales and Scotland.

The Government is to introduce a Bill to 
enshrine the one per cent cap in law – forcing the Opposition into a corner over 
whether to oppose limits in welfare which polls show are popular with 
the public.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan 
Smith will today tell MPs that three million families will be better off
by an average of £168 a month after multiple benefits are replaced by a
single, universal credit. The new system is designed to ensure it 
always pays to take a job or work more hours.

Under cuts outlined by Mr Osborne last week, working
age benefits will not rise in line with inflation - due to be 2.2 per 
cent next year - but will be capped at one per cent for each of the next
three years.

The Chancellor told MPs the changes 
were needed because 'fairness is about being fair to the person who 
leaves home every morning to go out to work and sees their neighbour 
still asleep, living a life on benefits'.

He said Jobseekers Allowance, Employment and Support Allowance, Income Support and Housing Benefit would be affected.

But the changes also affect maternity pay - with Labour dubbing the plans a 'Mummy Tax'.

Business Secretary Vince Cable attacking the 'demonisation' of people on benefits.

'Given the country's now poorer than it was before the banks collapsed, we have a massive budget deficit, we've going to have to look at the welfare budget because it's rising so much up up in forms of public spending,' he told BBC Radio 5Live.

'So certainly we should look at it, but we shouldn't gloat over the misfortune of others. The majority of people who are affected by this are actually in work and I think what we should be talking about a bit more is he steps the Government has taken to lift the tax threshold for people who are in low pay and are in work - that goes some way to offset the pressures on them.'

Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander, a Lib Dem, denied the squeeze will hit lower-income working families.

The Lib Dem MP said they would be more than compensated by other measures, including a rise in the basic-rate income tax threshold to £9,440.

Officials said that overall the average working family would be £125 a year better off next year.

In a YouGov survey yesterday, 52 per cent of voters backed the cap or said benefits should not rise at all, against 35 per cent who said the Government is wrong.

In an email to party members, Mr Clegg sought to distance himself from the policy. The Lib Dem leader wrote: ‘We worked to limit the impact of the next wave of cuts on low income families, ruling out the abolition of child benefit for families with two or more children, and saying we should keep housing benefit for under-25s who need a place to stay.

‘The welfare savings are less than half of the £10 billion cuts first floated. They give people on benefits exactly the same rise as we are giving in pay to nurses, civil servants and everyone else in the public sector.’
