For most people, swimming with sharks without a safety net is the stuff of nightmares.

But for Lesley Rochat - known as the 'shark warrior' - diving with the deadly creatures is one of her 'greatest joys'.

These incredible photos show the fearless free diver swimming with Tiger sharks off the coast of South Africa in a bid to promote conservation.

Naked: During the photo shoot, Ms Rochat even posed naked in the ocean while attached to a shark hook - with dozens of the sea creatures swimming around her. Above, the diver prepares to be attached to the hook

Attached: Ms Rochat, pictured on the large underwater shark hook, described the photo shoot as 'extreme'

Practice: The free diver and campaigner practices with the hook in a swimming pool prior to the photo shoot

Dressed in only a bikini, she is captured coming within touching distance of the creatures, which are considered one of the most deadly species in the world.

She can also be seen swimming alongside Lemon sharks, known for their powerful bite, and Caribbean reef sharks, which can grow up to 10ft long, in other locations.

The photos were taken as part of the campaign 'Get Hooked on Conservation, Ban Drumlines', which aims to stop the culling of sharks using drum lines in Western Australia and South Africa.

A drum line consists of a floating drum with two lines attached to it. One line is joined to an anchor on the sea bed, while the other attached to a large baited shark hook dangling underneath the surface of the water.

In January this year, West Australia's controversial catch-and-kill order saw the first shark shot to death after being discovered on a baited drum line off Meelup Beach, near Dunsborough. 

Ms Rochat, who founded the firm behind the campaign, AfriOceans, claims that an organisation in  South Africa has also been culling sharks using nets and drum lines 'for decades'.

On her blog, Ms Rochat, who has been diving with sharks for more than 15 years, described the shoot as 'extreme'.

'It was challenging because of the open ocean conditions, plus being naked, having to pose kinda dead hanging from a large hook while holding my breath and hoping the 30 plus sharks were in place! (sic),' she wrote.

'Shark
 culling is not new in South Africa, the KwaZulu Natal Sharks Board have
 been using shark nets and drumlines for decades.

Campaigner: Ms Rochat said she understood that there was a risk she might be bitten by the sea creatures

Fighting for sharks: However, she said she was determined to change people's perceptions of sharks. Left, another campaign poster with the caption: 'Catches Anything, Kills Everything'. Right, Ms Rochat after the shoot

'Up to 600 sharks plus
 hundreds of other marine life, including dolphins and whales, are 
caught by these barbaric killing devices every year.

'The
 ocean is the domain of sharks and we are merely guests in their world. 
We have no right just because a few of us get killed by sharks annually 
to go out and start suffocating and shooting sharks to death.'

Ms Rochat added that she understood that there was a risk she might be bitten by the sharks - but that she was determined to change people's perceptions of the creatures.
