A father-of-two was brutally attacked when he stepped in to stop his niece and nephew from being bullied by two teenage girls, his family said today.

Josh Price, 21, and his young relations were visiting Trinity Park in Ossett, West Yorkshire when two girls approached the children.

When the teens began bullying his family members, Mr Price asked them to stop.

Minutes later, he approached by two men. They violently attacked the young father before knocking him to the ground -  kicking and punching him.

Mr Price suffered a blood clot on his brain and was put in to a medically induced coma at Leeds General Infirmary. He also had a stroke and is currently paralysed down his right side.

The father has been moved from intensive care 
into a high dependency unit - but doctors have warned that there is 
scarring on his brain and another blood clot could form at any time.

Medics have told his partner Kirsty Berry, 22, and the rest of his family they do not know how severe Mr Price's long-term injuries will be.

His devastated family have said he is suffering from memory loss - and is struggling to remember the names of his two children - two-year-old Lacey and one-year-old Dylan.

One man has been arrested and bailed following the attack - which took place last Saturday.

Police are appealing for witnesses.

Mr Price's father Stuart, 43, said the attack took place after his son asked two girls to 'play nice' with his young family members.

The lorry driver said: 'As a parent you never want to see your child like that. We are all numb and in total shock. We’re barely functioning as a family.

'It was the worst phone call I could have imagined to receive. I got the first flight back from Spain and when I got to Leeds General Infirmary (LGI) on Sunday, Josh had been put into a coma.

'I was told that he had been at the park and two older girls were bullying his niece, so Josh went over and said "play nice".

'About ten or 15 minutes later this van pulls up and two guys get out and come  towards Josh.

'They gave him a vicious beating, but at some point he managed to get up and ran towards the nearby rugby clubhouse, where they followed him.

'They even assaulted some of the other people there who tried to stop them getting at Josh.

'People at the clubhouse were saying that Josh looked dazed, so we think he might have been concussed at that point.

'But when Josh left the rugby club, they went for him again, blindsided him, punched him to the ground and kicked his head while he was on the ground. Then they ran off.'

Mr Price's father said an ambulance was called and he was taken to hospital where he underwent three-hour surgery to remove a blood clot on his brain.

When he came out, he was in a medically-induced coma which he was gradually brought out of on Monday, and he was moved from intensive care to a high-dependency unit.

He added: 'He’s in and out of consciousness at the moment. His eyes are open sometimes but he can’t speak properly, he’s mumbling.

'He’s suffered a stroke at some point, which has caused him to be paralysed down his right-hand side and doctors said they can’t tell us if this will be permanent, because it all depends on how Josh’s recovery goes.

'He’s got severe memory loss, when we mention his daughter Lacey, he doesn’t know who we’re talking about, but when you show him a picture, he remembers her.

'His girlfriend Kirsty, me and my partner Stef, his mum, his sisters Stephanie and Danielle and other family have been taking it in turns to visit him. It’s been very hard for the whole family, it’s completely taken us by surprise.

'Josh’s children need their dad, they’re asking where their daddy is and we can’t answer them, it’s devastating. We need the people who did this to Josh catching.'

Detectives were called to the scene at about 9.40pm on Saturday.

Det lnsp Paul Harrison, of Wakefield CID, said: 'A 23-year-old man was arrested in connection with the incident but has been released on police bail.

'Our enquiries are ongoing and we would like to hear from anyone who witnessed this vicious assault.'

Anyone with information should contact Wakefield CID on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.
