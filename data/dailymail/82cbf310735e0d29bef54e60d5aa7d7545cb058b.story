Former Asian Football Confederation President Mohammed Bin Hammam is alleged to have paid out £3 million in bribes to football officials to secure support for the 2022 Qatar world cup bid

Leading MPs have called on Fifa to strip Qatar of the 2022 World Cup after it emerged illicit payments of £3 million were made to corrupt officials.

John Whittingdale, chairman of the Commons culture select committee, said: 'There is now an overwhelming case that the decision to where the World Cup should be held in 2022 should be run again.'

Conservative MP Damian Collins, who submitted a private member’s bill to Parliament last month that would fight corruption in football, also called for the process to be re-run.

A damning email dossier shows how Mohamed Bin Hammam former president of the Asian Football Confederation used the slush fund to garner support for Qatar's bid to host the tournament.

The Sunday Times reports that the 
bribes helped sway key members of FIFA’s 24-man ruling committee into 
giving the green light for the Arab emirate to host the tournament, 
despite its lack of football infrastructure.

It
 is alleged that delegates who decided upon the destination of the 2022 
competition were treated to lavish junkets and large cash payments to 
secure their support.

The
 secret dossier provides evidence of £3 million in cash payments to 
football officials across the globe in order to secure support for the 
Qatari bid.

When the decision was announced, there was shock as the Gulf state has no tradition of football or any suitable stadiums.

Also, concerns were raised that with temperatures exceeding 50c, it would be dangerous for both players and supporters.

During one
 session in 2008, Bin Hammam is believed to have handed over $200,000 
in cash to 25 delegates who had been flown to Kuala Lumpur to discuss 
the bid.

It is alleged that African football officials received cash payments up to $80,000 from accounts controlled by Bin Hammam.

The disclosures come less than two weeks before Brazil is set to host the World Cup and will heap pressure on the tiny desert state.

One official sought $232,000 to be paid into his personal bank account which he said would be used to develop football pitches.

Bin Hammam was banned from world football 2011 after he was discovered bribing officials during his bid to get elected Fifa president.

Fifa is now under pressure to re-examine the Qatari bid as a result of the latest corruption allegations

The Qatari World Cup committee now face an investigation by Fifa's ethics investigator Michael Garcia.

The New York lawyer is due to fly out to the middle east next week to investigate the controversial competition bid.

Among the shocking allegations, The Sunday Times alleges that former Caribbean football chief Jack Warner was paid $450,000 before the 2010 bid.

Qatar, which holds the world’s third-largest natural-gas reserves, plans to spend more than $200 billion on new infrastructure before hosting the sporting event.

This is expected to include $34 billion on a rail and metro system, $7 billion on a port and $17 billion on an airport.

The stadiums will cost $4 billion, according to the ministry of business and trade.

However, the Middle Eastern state of two million people is facing delays and escalating costs related to the event.

Work started later than planned on the metro system, and the opening of the new airport is six years behind schedule.

It originally announced plans for 12 stadiums, including nine new playing fields and three refurbishments, but that has bee cut to eight.

Fifa decided to announce the winners of 
the 2018 and 2022 World Cup bids on the same day in 2010, when they 
awarded the competition to Russia and then Qatar.

England had run a campaign to host the competition in 2018, but were humiliated when they received only two votes.

Prime Minister David Cameron and Prince William played a central role to the failed English bid.

Only last month, FIFA president Sepp Blatter admitted it had been a ‘mistake’ to hand the tournament to Qatar after technical assessors had said the searing temperatures could be harmful to players.

The revelations emerged as it was reported that police were probing World Cup match-fixing involving Nigeria.

A football agent was secretly filmed claiming that Nigerian footballers were willing to rig ties in Brazil for cash, saying: 'I know the games, I know the system.'

Members of the Qatar delegation denied that Bin Hammam had any role in their successful bid, while members of his family refused to comment on the issue.

FIFA's former president of the World Cup organising committee Jack Warner has been at the centre of corruption allegations

The awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar was one of the most controversial decisions in sporting history.

Even before
 the decision was made, there were persistent allegations of corruption.

Six weeks before the vote in Zurich, a World Cup official was caught in
 an undercover investigation agreeing to sell his vote to one of 
England’s rivals.

A
 second member of the same committee was recorded asking for 
£1.5 million for a sports academy. Both officials were suspended, 
meaning that 22 people voted instead of the usual 24.

A
 whistleblower also claimed that one of the bidders had bought the votes
 of three African executive committee members. The former Fifa employee 
later withdrew the allegations.

Following
 England’s defeat, a parliamentary committee held an inquiry into the 
failed bid. Lord Triesman, the bid’s former chairman, gave evidence 
stating that four Fifa executive committee members had asked for 
business deals and favours when negotiating their support.

One of those 
he named was former vice-president of Fifa Jack Warner.

Last month it was alleged Mr Warner and his family were paid almost $2 million (£1.2m) from a Qatari firm linked to the country’s successful bid.

The Daily Telegraph reported that Mr Warner appeared to have been personally paid $1.2 million (£720,000) from a company controlled by a former Qatari football official shortly after the decision to award the country the tournament.

Payments totalling almost $750,000 (£450,000) were made to Mr Warner's sons, documents show. A further $400,000 (£240,000) was paid to one of his employees.

It is understood that the FBI is now investigating Trinidad-based Mr Warner and his alleged links to the Qatari bid, and that the former Fifa official’s eldest son, who lives in Miami, has been helping the inquiry as a co-operating witness.

The question of the heat during a summer tournament has also been a one of the controversies raised since Qatar was announced as the winner of the bid in December 2010.

Players' union FIFPro has said it will urge its members not to take part if it is played in Qatar's summer, even if air conditioning is installed in the stadiums.

Qatar's building projects have also been hit by allegations of migrant construction workers not being given enough food or water, as well as accusations of corruption over the voting procedure to win the bid. Officials have denied the accusations.

Overall, the tiny gas-rich state plans to spend about $140 billion on a rail system, a new airport, a seaport, and hundreds of kilometers of new roads for the tournament, in addition to the stadiums that will host the matches.

The U.S. (2022 bidder)

America, which was an initial bidder for 2022, would undoubtedly be popular with travelling fans and it already has the stadia in place. However, the U.S. hosted the cup relatively recently, in 1994, when Diana Ross famously missed an open 
goal at the opening ceremony.

Australia (2022 bidder)

Australasia
 has never hosted a World Cup, so 
taking the finals there would allow Fifa to say it has taken the game to another continent. Australia, also beaten by Qatar for 2022, put on a spectacular success when it hosted the 2000 Sydney Olympics.

However, players and fans would face similar problems with heat as in Qatar if the competition is held there.

South Korea (2022 bidder)

Twenty years after 
jointly hosting Asia's first World Cup, South Korea wanted to do it 
again. Along with Japan, Korea was a worthy destination in 2002, but, 
like with the USA, the recentness would probably work against them.

Japan (2022 bidder)

Similarly
 to South Korea, Japan's joint host venture in 2002 is unlikely to aid 
them, although Tokyo will host the 2020 Olympics.

England (2018 bidder)

England, a 2018 World Cup bidder, have not hosted a 
World Cup since 1966, although it did showcase the European Championship in 1996. It boasts top-class stadia and held the London 2012 Olympics to enormous success. Tensions between the FA and Fifa could be a problem though.

Spain and Portugal (2018 bidder)

Spain
 hosted the World Cup in 1982 and Portugal delivered a vibrant Euro 
2004. Both countries, who bid for the 2018 competition, boast excellent stadia and a genuine footballing 
history.

Holland and Belgium (2018 bidder)

The two lowland countries launched a joint bid to host the 2018 World Cup. The pair hosted Euro 2000, but the tournament was marred by hooliganism and that would count against them. The stadia Belgium offered was also criticised.
