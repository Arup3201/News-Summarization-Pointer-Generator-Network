A New York-based woman has survived being run over by three Manhattan subway trains after drunkenly falling onto the tracks.

Mary Downey, 22, who lives in Woodlawn in the Bronx, escaped with nothing more than a fractured shoulder after her dance with death Sunday morning.

The bleary-eyed Irish immigrant tumbled onto the tracks at the 49th Street station near Times Square at around 6 a.m. as she was making her way home from a night out.

She lost her balance as she waited on the platform, breaking her shoulder on the way down moments before a northbound N train pulled in, according to The New York Post.

Her injury meant Downey was unable to lift herself off the rails.

But instead, in a split second, she managed to squeeze herself between the rails as the train barreled over her, avoiding being crushed to death.

She may have even positioned herself between the track and the platform at one point, NYPD sources told The Post.

'She was lucky enough to have, it looks like to us, rolled to the platform and was in between the platform and the train when the train came into the station,' FDNY Battalion Chief Mike Meyers said.

Authorities said she was conscious at 
the bottom of the empty station as the first, second, and then third 
train rolled over her oblivious.

Downey was finally discovered when the third train's operator saw her hand waving for help.

After initially thinking it was a piece of trash on the tracks, the subway operator ground the train to a halt but not before the third car was above her.

Subway staff called 911 and emergency crews arrived to pull Downey out from under the train, police said.

Covered in soot, the young woman was rushed by ambulance to hospital.

But a friend of Downey's told The Post at the hospital that the busted shoulder was miraculously her only injury.

'She's doing really well,' the friend said.

Downey was released just hours later in a wheelchair with her arm in a sling.

She was supported by a group of friends into a cab as she wiped away tears, The Post reported.
