West Ham are back on the trail of Racing Genk's Belgium international striker Jelle Vossen.

The 25-year-old scored 19 goals in all competitions for the club last season, with Sam Allardyce interested in the player in January.

However the Hammers were put off by his price tag during the window, with Genk reportedly wanting as much as Â£9million for Vossen - he is unlikely to command such a fee now.

Firepower: West Ham boss Sam Allardyce is looking to bolster his attacking options

Vossen has 12 caps for the national team but has not made Marc Wilmots' World Cup squad.

Sam Allardyce has been tasked with making the east London club play a more attractive brand of football next season, and has already moved to bring Mauro Zarate in on a three-year deal.

Former England striker Teddy Sheringham earlier this week joined Allardyce's staff as an attacking coach.
