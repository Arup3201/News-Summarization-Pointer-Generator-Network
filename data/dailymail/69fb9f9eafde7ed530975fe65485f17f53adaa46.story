Bob Welch committed suicide after believing he would never recover from recent spinal surgery.

The Fleetwood Mac star was found by wife Wendy on Thursday, with a gunshot wound to his chest.

Family friend Bart Herbison has revealed the musician, who was a member of the Grammy-nominated band from 1971 to 1974, did not want to burden his wife following a period of ill health.

Bart, an executive director of the National Songwriters Association,  said: 'It had become apparent to Bob that he was not going to recover, that he was going to become an invalid.

Suicide: Former Fleetwood Mac member Bob Welch was found dead today after shooting himself in the chest

'He had seen his father become an 
invalid and watched his mother care for him for many years. In the 
letter he left, he told (his wife) Wendy, "I'm not going to do this to 
you."'

Despite the tragic turn of events, Bart insists Bob, 66, and Wendy were in love.

He told The Tennessean newspaper: 'I’ve been privileged to meet a lot of famous musicians throughout the years.

'Your fame and notoriety will take 
you to a lot of places where you have to go by yourself, but not Bob. He
never went anywhere without Wendy.'

On Thursday, it was reported that Welch shot himself at his Nashville home around 12.15pm.

The Californian musician had had health issues recently, according to police spokesman Don Aaron, who confirmed that Welch left a suicide note.

The spokesman would not elaborate on specific details regarding Welch's health - but added that there was no
evidence of foul play.

Welch, who also had a solo career, was a guitarist and vocalist for Fleetwood Mac in the Seventies and worked on albums such 
as Future Games and Bare Trees.

He formed the British rock group Paris in 1976, and had hits including Sentimental Lady in 1977 and Ebony Eyes in 1978.

Fleetwood Mac's Christine McVie and Lindsey Buckingham did backing vocals on Sentimental Lady.

Fleetwood Mac's career took off in the mid-1970s after Welch left the band.

Dreams was a No1 hit in 1977, and Don't Stop hit the top of the charts the same year.

It later became the anthem for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign. Hold Me was a hit in 1982 and Little Lies in 1987.

Welch, a native of Los Angeles, scored his biggest hit with Sentimental Lady, which reached No8 on the Billboard chart.

His other singles included Precious Love in 1979 and Hot Love, Cold World in 1978.

Welch fell out with his former bandmates after suing the group in 1994 for unpaid royalties, which led to his exclusion from the group's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction in 1998.   

'It basically comes down to the fact that they don't like me anymore,' he told The Plain Dealer of Cleveland at the time.

'I guess they can do what they want. I could understand it if I had been a sideman for a year. But I was an integral part of that band... I put more of myself into that band than anything I've ever done.'

Devastated: Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks told The Associated Press that Welch's death hit her hard

Longtime Fleetwood Mac singer Stevie Nicks told Associated Press that Welch's death hit her hard.

'The
death of Bob Welch is devastating... I had many great times with him 
after Lindsey and I joined Fleetwood Mac. He was an amazing guitar 
player - he was funny, sweet - and he was smart. I am so very sorry for 
his family and for the family of Fleetwood Mac - so, so sad.'

As a songwriter, Welch had tracks recorded by Kenny Rogers, Sammy Hagar and the Pointer Sisters.

In 1999 he released a CD, Bob Welch Looks at Bop, a salute to bebop music in the 1940s.

In an interview with The Tennessean in 2003, Welch said he never dreamed he'd be remembered for much.

'I
just wanted to play guitar in a good band,' he said. 'I wanted to make 
the music I love. I wanted to travel the world and have adventures.'

Welch also said 'music is disposable now. It doesn't have the emotional impact anymore. That's sad.'

He had lived in Nashville since the 1990s.

Welch is the second member of Fleetwood Mac to die this year. In January, another former guitarist for the band, Bob Weston, died in London from a gastrointestinal haemorrhage, at age 64.
