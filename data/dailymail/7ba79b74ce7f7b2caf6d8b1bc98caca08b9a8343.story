Cardboard boxes left inches away from a wood-burning stove  are being blamed as the cause of the Orrington, Maine fire that left three children and their father dead on in the early hours of Saturday morning.

The fact that the family was only using the stove temporarily as they waited for loan approval to finance their purchase of a new furnace adds to the outrage over the situation.

The only survivor of the fire was the children’s mother, Christine Johnson, who escaped while her husband Benjamin, their nine-year-old son Ben, eight-year-old daughter Leslie, and 4-year-old son Ryan were all trapped inside.

Tragic: Christine Johnson, 31, survived by climbing out a window but she realized that her husband and three children, including Leslie, 4, 'went the wrong way'

The Bangor Daily News reports that 
when the fire department arrived on the scene, they tried to enter 
through a window but ruled the blaze too dangerous and were forced to 
pull back.

Bucksport fire 
chief Craig Bowden said that they four victims were likely already dead 
when the responders got to the scene around 2.30am. The fire took two 
hours to fully extinguish.

Neighbors Terri and Doug Winslow called the police when they heard Christine screaming and they called the fire department.

'We
jumped out of bed and (we) saw the orange fire on the front of the 
house. I called 911 while my husband jumped into some clothes and 
grabbed some coats. While I was on the phone with emergency I opened the
window and hollered out to her that I heard her and she kept hollering 
to please help,' neighbor Terri Winslow told the Bangor Daily News.

'(Christine) said that her husband and kids were in the house which I relayed to 911.

'When
I opened the window I heard her and her husband talking ... and she 
just kept saying "they went the wrong way, they went the wrong way!"

'She was sitting on the breezeway in between the house and the garage.

'My husband threw a bird bath through a window and hollered in to see if anybody responded.

'I knew that from the previous owners there was a door there and I knew that if I opened the door I would be confronted by a wall of flames and I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to get out, so I didn't go in,' Mrs Winslow said.

'When
I opened the window I heard her and her husband talking ... and (Christine) just kept saying "they went the wrong way, they went the wrong way!"'

The bodies of the three children were found in a bedroom on the second floor while the father’s body was found at the top of the stairs nearby. Christine was on the roof of the home when emergency workers arrived.

This fire- which is the deadliest fire in Maine in the past 20 years- is not the family’s first tragedy, as The Portland Press Herald reports that one of the couple’s son Thomas died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in 2007.  

Christine Johnson is still being treated for smoke inhalation at Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor and is fielding visits from friends as she begins to plan the funerals for her husband and children.

‘Ben was her soul, the kids were her soul, so I just don’t know how well she’s going to recover,’ her friend Tabitha Robertson told the paper.

‘It’s just been one thing after another for her.’

Deadly: Firefighting crews from Bangor and four other towns were called in after the fire was reported at around 2:30 a.m., and it took an hour to extinguish the blaze

Remainders: The husband was found at the top of the stairs on the second floor and the three children were found together in a second floor bedroom

The children attended Center Drive School where Principal Roy Allen described them as 'great kids, very nice kids.'

'This is just such a tragedy. It's going to be devastating for the kids because it's such a small school and everybody knows everybody,' Allen told the Bangor Daily News.

The Johnsons had just moved into the house in the rural town of Orrington six months ago. They were in the process of buying the house through a short sale, meaning that it would take months for the loan agreement would be finalized by the lender, JP Morgan Chase, in the coming months.

Once the sale was approved, they were planning on replacing the 46-year-old hot water furnace, which explains their use of the wood stove with a propane heater.

The Johnsons arrived home late Friday night after an evening of family bowling and lit the stove in the first floor living room.

Investigators found empty cardboard boxes- which were likely used as kindling to start the fire in the first place- just inches away from the stove. A container of lighter fluid was nearby as well, which added to the pace at which the fire spread.

Damage: The fire ravaged the house and caused part of the roof to collapse

Tragic end of a nice night: The family lit the fire to keep the house warm after returning home from a night at the local bowling lanes

Police are still investigating the fire, but their initial reports suggest that they did not have smoke alarms installed in the home.

One of the last people to see the husband and children alive was the owner of their local bowling center, appropriately titled Family Fun, who was in shock at the news of the fire.

‘The entire bowling center is in shock. It feels like he’s been here forever,’ owner Andy Meucci said of Benjamin Johnson.

‘We were surprised he was only 30 because it seems like he’s been here so long. He started up with the Saturday morning youth league and did that for five or six years and has been in adult leagues ever since,’ Meucci told the Bangor Daily News.

‘You get a ring every time you shoot a 300 and [Johnson] gave one to each of his kids.

‘He’s a little bigger than life in the bowling scene. He also used to bowl Tuesday nights, but that got too expensive with having kids. He and Christine still bowled together in the Dunnett’s Friday Night Mixed Couples League, though.’

Benjamin worked at Hollywood Casino in Bangor and Christine is a self-published author who released her first book ‘The Quest For The Enchanted Stone’ earlier this summer.

In her brief author bio, she describes herself as living happily in a small town in Maine with her husband of 10 years. She also says that she is the mother of four, clearly including her son Thomas who died in 2007.

‘I enjoy drawing, and have enough books in my house to start my own bookstore. I enjoy horseback riding, singing, and as strange as this sounds, yard work. I’ve travelled all over as an ex-military brat,’ she wrote.

Center Drive School remained open during the Veteran’s Day holiday Monday in order for the victim’s classmates to meet with grief counsellors that were available.

One of those students was Hatty May Hubler, whose mother Jennifer brought the third grader to meet with a counsellor because she was friends with Leslie.

‘It’s hard trying to come to terms with it. It comes in waves but the school is doing a good job for the students,’ Ms Hubler said.
