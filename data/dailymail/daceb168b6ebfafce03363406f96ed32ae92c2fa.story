Two pranksters have filmed themselves scaring motorists by getting into their cars when stopped in traffic.

The video, viewed by almost 100,000 people on YouTube, shows Jay Swingler and Romell Henry, both 19, making drivers jump in Dudley in the West Midlands.

The friends have called their game 'horrible but hilarious' with one young woman bursting into tears fearing she was about to be attacked.

Other drivers did laugh when the young men got into their passenger seat.

Prank: A woman screams and then bursts into tears as one of the pranksters gets into her car in traffic

Upset: Romell Henry, 19, then apologises to the young driver as she sobs and says he thought she was someone else in Dudley, West Midlands

Retaliation: Romell is then threatened by another driver who spots his 'horrible but hilarious' game played by him and his friend

Friends: Jay Swingler and Romell Henry, both 19, said they spent two hours filming drivers' reactions and feared for their own safety

The boys have admitted they were more concerned about their own safety, as they feared they might get attacked.

On one occasion another driver confronts Romell after a woman screamed when he got into her car.

Jay said: 'We got the idea randomly and then we just filmed it and we got some good reactions which made the video even better.

'It took about two hours to film as we had to move to different locations.

'The scariest part was not knowing what was going to happen when we got in the car, I thought I was gonna get shot in the throat by someone, but I just did it anyway, because I don't care about life.

Another go: The pair targeted cars in traffic or traffic lights and filmed from the distance to gauge the reaction

Joke: This woman saw the funny side and told him not to worry after he got into her car

Chat: This female driver also laughed at Jay and then told him 'you frightened me to death'

Calm: This driver say Jay in the passenger seat and politely asked him to leave

'I showed my mom and she howled with laughter, which she always does because she loves the videos I post on youtube.

'My friends all support what we do too because we all share the same humour.

'The best reaction was when Romell got into a woman's car and she screamed as she thought she was getting mugged, horrible but hilarious.  

'We wanted to see if this would work and it did, this actually shows that you should lock your car doors'.
