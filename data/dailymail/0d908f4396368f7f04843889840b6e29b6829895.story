American model Sean O'Pry is continuing to make waves this side of the pond thanks to his latest smouldering campaign for Next.

The 25-year-old from Kennesaw, Georgia, who is the world's top earning male model according to Forbes, is back for a third season with the High Street label.

Dressed in stylish Spring '15 looks, he's pictured strolling down the palm tree-lined streets of LA, on the beach and in a studio.

Next's latest menswear range features sharp, affordable tailoring, casual weekend jumpers and chinos, plus street-wear parkas and shoes.

The accomplished star is modelling the brand's third seasonal range, after making headlines with the SS14 and AW14 styles.

He recently worked closely with pop princess Taylor Swift in her video for her number one hit, Blank Space. In the clip, he plays Taylor's love interest and they share a steamy kiss. And his portrayal of her lover won him a whole new fan base, as well as worldwide recognition. 

Despite getting close to the singer Sean's reportedly dating Australian Home and Away actress, Jessica McNamee, 28.

'They met through mutual friends during the summer. She fell for him hard,' a source has told magazine US Weekly.

'It's going well, everybody likes him. He has a good sense of humor on top of those looks,' the insider is also quoted saying.  

The High Street label is certainly a more accessible brand for Sean, and his work with it has exposed him to a wider audience

However, Sean's rep has denied the genetically blessed pair are an item, saying the reports are 'not true' and that they 'are just good friends'. 

Last month, when asked about his relationship status and if he was single, the smouldering music video star told E! News: 'I plead the Fifth. The less people know the better.' 

He also appeared in Madonna's 2012 video for Girl Gone Wild, but the hunk is better known for his role as in Taylor's film clip for Blank Space, which received more than 100 million views on YouTube.

Sean has been making a name for himself as a model after being scouted through MySpace in 2006, while he was just 17.

He has been hard at work lever since, landing major ad campaigns for high end designers like Versace, D&G, Marc Jacobs, Salvatore Ferragamo, Hugo Boss, Armani, Ralph Lauren, Jil Sander and Viktor & Rolf.

Branching out into the British High Street could be a smart move on behalf of Sean's management.

David Gandy went from D&G to M&S, and he's now a household name who models and designs for the trusted store. He has lent his face and opinion to prestigious British brands - even writing articles for UK publications like Vogue, GQ and the Telegraph - and remains a leading face in the world of male modelling.

According to Forbes magazine, it's estimated that Sean, managed by VNY Model Management, earned £940,000 ($1.5 million) in 2013 making him the world's highest paid male model.

In a recent interview Sean, a man's man, said he likes to golf and restore cars in his spare time.
