The Queensland mother-of-three who miraculously survived 17 days in rugged bushland was revealed to have emerged 16kg lighter after surviving on only water. 

Shannon Fraser is being treated at Innisfail hospital in Northern Queensland for third degree burns, insect bites, numerous welts, cuts and bruises after reappearing on Wednesday. 

Glad to have her back, her brother Dylan Fraser told the Courier Mail that she looked like 'Biggest Loser meets Bear Grylls'.

'She's lost lots of weight, she's covered in cuts and scratches, but she's in good spirits,' he said.

The 30-year-old was last seen at the Golden swimming spot in the south of Cairns on September 21 before she went missing. 

The former cancer patient's 11-year-old daughter Takirah, told the Courier Mail that her former 90kg mother 'looks way skinnier, but she's in a lot of pain', adding that she was ecstatic Ms Fraser was alive.

Ms Fraser has already shared some of her miraculous tale with her family, which included close encounters with a cassowary and crocodiles, according to the Courier Mail.

Her brother revealed that she found her way to safety by following coloured markers left by search teams who spent two weeks looking for her in the jungle around Mt Bartle.

Ms Fraser's mother, Deidre Sharrock, told reporters earlier that a farmer found her daughter when she stumbled out of the bush.

'She's badly burnt, she's lost a lot of weight,' Ms Sharrock told The Courier Mail.

'She's got a lot of infected cuts from fighting the scrub. She told us she just sat in a creek for three days to soothe her cuts and burns.

'It's incredible, it's amazing, we all thought she was dead. Thank God, she's alive.'

Police have not confirmed any of the circumstances around Ms Fraser's reappearance, other than to say she was found safe and well on Wednesday morning.

Ms Fraser had gone to the swimming hole with two men including her partner.

Her partner later told police he'd left her sitting alone under a gazebo near the river but when he returned five or 10 minutes later, she was gone.

Her disappearance sparked an intensive search, police suspicions she might have met with foul play, and a public appeal for information by her mother.
