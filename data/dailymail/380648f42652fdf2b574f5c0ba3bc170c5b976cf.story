The Marchioness of Worcester has turned Miss Marple after a valuable statue of a pig went missing at a society party – and was last seen in the company of a convicted fraudster.

The £8,000 bronze was auctioned last month at a fundraiser for Tracy Worcester’s animal welfare charity, Pig Business, held at London nightclub, 41 Mayfair.

It was bought by Matthew Unger Brown, who was last seen jumping into a taxi with it.

Stymied: This £8,000 pig statue went missing after being auctioned to known conman Matthew Unger Brown who was seen getting in a cab with it, but now claims it has disappeared

But Unger Brown, 29, is a serial conman who, the Marchioness says, paid with an ‘uncashable’ cheque. Unger Brown, meanwhile, claims he hasn’t got the pig, saying he may have left it in the taxi.

Now the Marchioness  – who starred in the 1980s TV detective series CATS Eyes –  has launched an investigation, searching CCTV footage to establish the truth.

She said: ‘I’m giving him a month to sort it out – either return the pig or come up with the money.’

Tracy Worcester says Mr Brown paid with an 'uncashable' cheque and has now launched an investigation

A statement issued by Unger Brown’s lawyers said: ‘He categorically denies he behaved fraudulently’ and that he ‘lawfully purchased’ the pig.

In 2004, he admitted deception charges after posing as an aristocrat to get a credit card, running up bills of thousands of pounds.
