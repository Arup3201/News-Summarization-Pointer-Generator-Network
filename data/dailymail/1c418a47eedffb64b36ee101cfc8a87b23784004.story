Roger Federer finally appeared on court in Lille  in a major boost for Switzerland ahead of their Davis Cup final against France starting Friday.

Federer hadn't trained since his withdraw from Sunday's ATP World Tour Finals in London, where he told the crowd he wasn't 'match fit' to take on Novak Djokovic.

The world No 2 was unable to recover from his epic three-set semi-final win against his Swiss team-mate Stanislas Wawrinka the night before in which he saved four match points before claiming victory in a tie-break.

But the 17-time major winner, for whom the Davis Cup title is a notable absentee on his long list of achievements, was well enough to hit-up for  the first time since then on the clay courts of the Pierre-Mauroy de Villeneuve-d'Ascq stadium.

Federer appeared in good spirits, smiling throughout a hit-up which lasted about 30 minutes with the Swiss No 4 Michael Lammer after forgoing an earlier designated slot in the early afternoon.

Wawrinka and the remainder of the Swiss team trained for about two hours in the afternoon with team coach Ivo Warner and captain Severin Luthi.

Federer is yet to confirm if he will be fit to take on the first singles rubbers in Lille on Friday

Federer is yet to confirm whether he will take his place in the opening singles matches on Friday against a team including Richard Gasquet, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Julien Benneteau and Gael Monfils.

But if he gives Luthi the nod he will be certain to line up for either the first or second singles match with Wawrinka, the current world No 4, taking the other slot.

'I'm making some progress,' he said on Tuesday. 'But I know I don't have a month ahead of me to get better. I need to get better quickly. I'm trying whatever I can.'

While the French side has admirable depth, the Swiss rankings drop off significantly after their top two with Marco Chiudinelli world No 212 and Lammer ranked 508th.

Federer and Wawrinka trained separately despite insisting during a team press conference together on Tuesday that their differences, arrising from Federer's wife Mirka calling Wawrinka a 'crybaby' from the stands on Saturday, had been resolved.

'We had a conversation after the match,' Federer told reporters after the pair reportedly had a 10-minute spat in a gym after the match. 'Everything is totally relaxed.'

Wawrinka added: 'It has become a big deal but for us, it's nothing. It took us five minutes to talk about that.'
