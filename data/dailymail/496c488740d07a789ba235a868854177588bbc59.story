No football fans like taking a beating at the hands of their local rivals, but Cologne fans suffered more than usual after their defeat by Borussia Monchengladbach on Saturday.

After Switzerland international Granit Xhaka had scored a last-minute winner for the hosts in the Rhine derby, some Cologne fans decided to storm the pitch.

The visiting supporters, dressed in white boiler suits, burst out of the crowd onto the playing surface and then threw flares at the players as they left the field.

But some of the pitch invaders got more than they'd bargained for, with both police and then some Gladbach fans dishing out harsh punishment.

Videos taken from the crowd show some of the men being repeatedly punched and kicked as they tried to get back into the stands.

After the incident Cologne moved quickly to condemn the fans involved. 

A club statement read that Cologne were 'disappointed and angered' by the disturbances that 'cause massive harm to Cologne and the majority of Cologne's fans.'

Promising 'tough action,' they added: 'Whoever claims to be a Cologne fan and behaves like this does not understand the basic rules of football and is not wanted.'

'Cologne will do everything in his power, as it has done in the past, to identify the perpetrators and sanction the groups involved,' read a statement.

'We also appeal to fans to distance themselves clearly from those that are extremely harmful to the club intentionally by their illegal behaviour.'
