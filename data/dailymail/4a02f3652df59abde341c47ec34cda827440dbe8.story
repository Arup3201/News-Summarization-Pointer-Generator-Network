Colorado's marijuana enthusiasts are in for a treat.

While similar consoles do already exist for registered dispensaries in states where the drug is approved for medical use, never before has a machine been aimed at the recreational user; enabling customers to purchase marijuana directly, rather than over the counter as it were.

The appropriately emerald-hued ZaZZZ machine, manufactured by American Green, was unveiled on Saturday in Avon, Colorado, stocked with Herbal Elements marijuana. And while the console won't be available to the general public quite yet, its first outing certainly generated excitement.

Revolutionary: The green-stocked ZaZZZ machine was unveiled at a private event in Avon, Colorado on Saturday

Stephen Shearin, CEO of the machine's parent company, Tranzbyte, who spoke to The Cannabist, describes the weed-purveying robot as: 'An automated, age-verifying, climate-controlled marijuana dispensing machine.'

And while it does appear to take the convenience of buying marijuana to new levels of easy, the company claims it has covered its bases in terms of security.

Nifty: The dispenser (pictured) is aimed at recreational marijuana users in the future, but is still only available for medical-use license holders

'[The user] would swipe their driver's license at which point multiple cameras 
would allow us to use some advanced biometrics to make absolutely 
certain that the person who swiped the card is the owner of that card,' Mr Shearin explained to 9News while speaking at the launch.

'I'm a father of a 12-year-old daughter and I wouldn't want her having 
access to it, so we paid close attention to that.'

For those who do meet the right criteria however, it's a simple case of: 'Swipe ID and get verified. Select products and pay. Retrieve products and depart using appropriate bagging solution.'

Hopes for a greener future: California-based Medbox (left) currently caters for the medical-use only niche but ZaZZZ (right) hopes that it can capitalize on Colorado's legalization of marijuana for recreational use too

The machine is currently housed at Herbal Elements, an Avon medical dispensary; so will still not yet be available for recreational users 'at this point' - essentially until the company feels itâ€™s ready.

Only last year, Bruce Bedrick, CEO of Medbox, a California-based weed vending machine for medical use only, predicted that the transition from machines such as his, to those available to the general public such as the ZaZZZ model, was 'a couple of years down the road'.

Some 
people want to see this free-flowing marijuana. They want to go from 
federal and state ban to marijuana for everybody

'Some 
people want to see this free-flowing marijuana. They want to go from 
federal and state ban to marijuana for everybody,' Mr Bedrick - also known as 'the Steve Jobs of medical marijuana dispensing' - said to The Huffington Post.

'We 
don't believe that can happen. In order to gain respect and trust, it's 
better to go through gradual, medical adoption.'

However, since both Colorado and Washington State recently legalized the drugs recreational use, it's likely that a whole wash of ambitious companies will be hot on the heels of ZaZZZ's business model, and sooner than many predicted.

Machines already exist on the market in Californian medical dispensaries, but the ZaZZZ machine will focus on the recreational user
