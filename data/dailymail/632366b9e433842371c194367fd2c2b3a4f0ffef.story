A female McDonald’s employee has been arrested after allegedly selling heroin in Happy Meals out of the fast-food restaurant’s drive thru.

Shantia Dennis, 26, was still wearing her uniform when police took her into custody after arranging a fake drugs buy from the Pittsburgh franchise.

Customers would approach the drive thru and ask for ‘a toy’ before proceeding to the delivery window where Dennis would hand them a children’s meal box with the drugs inside.

Allegheny County authorities made the arrest after an informant told them that an employee was selling the drug at a McDonald's in the East Liberty section of the city.

Undercover law enforcement officials then managed to purchase a Happy Meal containing heroin from Dennis, Mike Manko, communications director for the Allegheny County District Attorney's Office said in a statement.

The undercover officers recovered ten bags of heroin inside of a Happy Meal box, after which Dennis was escorted from her place of work in handcuffs.

The procedure to procure heroin from Dennis was simple: her ‘customers’ would go through the drive-through and say, ‘I'd like to order a toy’, after which they would be instructed to proceed to the first window, where they would be handed a heroin Happy Meal box, Manko said.

Upon Dennis’ arrest, police recovered an additional 50 bags of heroin, as well as a small amount of marijuana.

Dennis is charged with two counts of possession, one count of criminal use of a communication facility, one count of prohibited acts of delivery and one count of possession with intent to deliver.

Another McDonald's employee was arrested this month for selling heroin out of a restaurant in nearby Murrysville.

Authorities said the heroin recovered Wednesday does not appear to be related to the fentanyl-laced heroin blamed for 22 overdose deaths in southwestern Pennsylvania.
