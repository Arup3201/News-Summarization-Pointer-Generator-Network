The NFL has asked potential Super Bowl half-time acts to pay to perform at the coveted show next year, it has emerged.

The league usually doesn't pay the act, but this year, it has asked potential performers if they would be willing to contribute a portion of their post-Super Bowl tour income to the NFL or offer another type of financial contribution, a source told the Wall Street Journal.

The request reportedly did not go down well with the performers - which have been narrowed down to Rihanna, Katy Perry and Coldplay, according to the sources.

The NFL usually pays for the halftime performers' travel and production expenses, which can run well into the millions. After the show, acts typically see huge boosts in record and ticket sales.

NFL spokeswoman Joanna Hunter would not comment on the claims, saying contracts with performers were confidential and that its goal was simply 'to put on the best possible show'.

She would also not comment on the list of three performers, the Journal reported.

The Super Bowl will be played outside Phoenix on February 1.

In this year's Super Bowl, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Bruno Mars drew a record 115.3 million viewers - more than the game itself - when they played the halftime show at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey.

Should acts have to pay to perform at the Super Bowl halftime show?

According to Nielsen, the Fox telecast of the game between the Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks drew 112.2 million viewers.

The show has long been a key promotional opportunity and some performers, including Beyonce and Bruno Mars, have put tickets to upcoming tours on sale immediately afterwards.

As well as selling out these tours, artists have also enjoyed a boost in download sales.

Earlier this year, Bruno Mars' second album, 'Unorthodox Jukebox', jumped from number 18 to seven on the Billboard Top 200 following his performance, while his debut album, 'Doo-Wops & Hooligans', jumped from number 82 to 19 on the chart.

Previous Super Bowl half-time acts might not have been paid for their performances, but they have reaped the financial benefits long after the trophy has been lifted.

With record numbers of viewers tuning in to watch the extravagant show - last year, 115.3 million watched Bruno Mars and the Red Hot Chili Peppers take the stage - the performance gives stars an unparalleled promotional opportunity.

After his performance, Mars' second album, 'Unorthodox Jukebox', jumped from 
number 18 to number seven on the Billboard Top 200, 
while his debut album, 'Doo-Wops & Hooligans', jumped from number 82
 to 19 on the chart.

It is not known exactly how much the appearance boosted his earnings, but by June 2014, he had earned $60 million, putting him at number 13 on Forbes' Celebrity 100 this year - his first ever appearance on the list.

As Billboard pointed
 out, Mars was a relatively new artist compared to previous performers, 
who included Michael Jackson, Paul McCartney, Madonna and Bruce 
Springsteen. It meant that his two albums quickly shot up the charts, 
while previous artists saw the Super Bowl's impact on sales spread more 
equally across numerous albums and songs.

After Beyonce's show in 2013, she saw a 68 per cent boost in her track sales, while Madonna experienced a staggering 165 per cent rise in sales following her show in 2012. Astonishingly, The Who saw a 392 per cent increase in sales after their show in 2010, Nielson reported.

Some performers, including Beyoncé and Bruno Mars, have also put tickets to upcoming tours on sale immediately afterwards.

Beyoncé's 'Mrs. Carter Show', which she announced following her lauded performance at the 2013 game, grossed more than any other that year besides Bon Jovi's, Pollstar reported.
