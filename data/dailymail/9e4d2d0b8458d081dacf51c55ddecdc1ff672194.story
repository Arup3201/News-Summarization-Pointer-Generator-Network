England is set to get a glamorous new WAG soon as Mario Balotelli looks for a new home in the north, bringing with him his stunning Belgian fiancée.

The playboy and former Milan striker has caused a stir in the football world by signing to Liverpool for a cool £16 million.

And it's all change for Mario on the romantic front, too: the 24-year-old has shunned his old Lothario ways for domestic bliss with new fiancée Fanny Neguesha.

Mario proposed to Fanny earlier this summer before the World Cup and the couple will soon move to the UK

With her exotic beauty and incredible body (which she isn't afraid to show off) it is not hard to see why Mario fell for Fanny 

The 24-year-old model already has over 200,000 followers on Instagram, where she posts endless selfies

And it is not difficult to see how the brainy beauty, 24, has snared this football heavyweight - she's stunningly beautiful, with a figure that wouldn’t look out of place on the cover of Sports Illustrated and also speaks three languages, Italian, French and English.

She is already causing a stir among WAG-watchers, with her arrival in the UK set to ruffle the feathers of established wives such as Coleen Rooney, Abbey Clancey and Alex Gerrard.

Dedicating her Instgram account to selfies and plenty of revealing shots of her incredible body, the model has already garnered over 258,400 followers.

Fanny has brains as well as beauty, speaking three languages fluently

And this number looks set to rise as the couple, who are no strangers to the party scene, arrive in the UK for Mario to take up his new post.

The pair have been preparing for this new chapter in their life with a relaxing holiday in Versilia, Italy with friends.

Despite his previous wayward ways with women - he has dated several high-profile glamour models - Balotelli appears smitten.

He told Italian Vanity Fair: ‘In a short time she found herself in sync with me. I could spend my whole life with someone like this.

Fanny's Italian, Rwandan and Congolese heritage contribute to her beauty 

Mario was spotted during a Liverpool training session at at Melwood Training Ground today 

‘Am I in love? Yes, but I am not good at talking about it. I am shy.’

And it seems the beauty - who works as a model - is as smitten with Mario as he with her, having already had her love for him permanently inked on her arm.

She has the words ‘your love is the only thing that makes me love’ tattooed on her arm, with Balotelli’s name underneath.

After Mario proposed in June, Fanny also posted a romantic message: ‘Tonight, I said the most important yes of my life. That was the best present for my birthday. I love you first and unique husband.’
