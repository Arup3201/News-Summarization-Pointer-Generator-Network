Chelsea are the team to stop, but they will be nervous. With their firepower and their quality, they are ripe for this title… but they haven’t got away from Manchester City, who have had to deal with poor form and injuries to key players. They will want to get an early trophy back at Stamford Bridge to ease the pressure, so I expect them to take the Capital One Cup. Jose Mourinho did his business early in the window and all three players – Cesc Fabregas, Diego Costa and Thibaut Courtois – have been terrific. Courtois is the best goalkeeper in the Barclays Premier League. I wish they would stop calling it on about diving. You usually get the reputation you deserve.

Chelsea have been unable to shake off the challenge of Manchester City going into the New Year

Costa would pick a fight with his best mate. So it’s no surprise to see he has history with one of Thursday's opponents. Federico Fazio of Spurs traded blow with Costa when Sevilla played Atletico Madrid, so be ready for a tear up. My money is on Costa, because he loves a scrap and is made for this league. I said it at the start that he would fit in and he has looked at home. He is a beast of a centre forward

Costa has proved he is made for the Premier League and is up for the fight 

John Terry, Steven Gerrard and Dany Alves are free transfers worth looking at. Each player will be able to talk to foreign clubs once the transfer window opens. I expect Terry to stay – why would Chelsea let him go? He is getting better with age. It’s remarkable to think that Rafa Benitez tried to drive him out two seasons ago! Stevie is more interesting; he can still do a job for Liverpool and I hope he stays, but he may feel the criticism has become unbearable. If he does stay, I hope he settles down and just plays. There is too much ‘let’s make him a holding midfielder’, or ‘let’s push him forward’. Just let him play! Barcelona’s Alves isn’t the force he used to be, but at 31, he isn’t washed up yet. I expect English clubs to push hard.

John Terry, Steven Gerrard and Dani Alves are all out of contract in the summer and free to talk to overseas clubs from the beginning of January 

Mario Balotelli has the most shots without scoring in the whole of Europe. What a poor signing he has been for Liverpool. When he signed I wrote: ‘There is a reason why there are cheap sale at a supermarket’. People tell me he’s a good lad, despite what you may have read, but he’s not good enough technically to sustain a place in a top team.

Mario Balotelli has had more shots in the league than anyone else in Europe without scoring 

United are still short and I can't see them making it a three-horse race. They need two top defenders to make the jump. They have plenty of firepower, but a man on the street could turn that group of players into a winning team. They are still behind Chelsea and Manchester City in quality throughout the team. LVG has done okay and I expect them to make the top four.

Manchester United are still short of some top defenders to challenge for the title

Angel di Maria has been good for United going forward - but they are still short at the back

Southampton are better equipped to finish higher than West Ham. I don’t see them making the top four, but I can see them making the top six. They have to keep Morgan Schneiderlin or they might finish as low as 10th. He is that important to them. If they sell him in this window, they might as well wave the white flag.

Morgan Schneiderlin is key to Southampton finishing high up the table

Alex Song and Stewart Downing have been excellent. West Ham are a changed team. They have played exciting, entertaining football and Song has made a real impact. Having someone like him in the team has helped Downing and his confidence is high. Recruitment at West Ham has been excellent and finishing in the top eight should be considered successful.

Alex Song and Stewart Downing have both been star performers for West Ham

The player of the season so far has been Cesc Fabregas. At Barcelona, he looked off the boil. He wasn’t sharp, he was in and out of the team and he was played in different roles. At Chelsea, he looks reborn and a joy to watch.

Cesc Fabregas has been one of the best signings this season and been a key player for Chelsea 

Wilfried Bony is the man to buy. Swansea will fight to keep him, or at least receive the biggest fee. He is a powerhouse who would improve any side, apart from the top two. And even City and Chelsea would benefit from having him in their squad. He’s a top-class goalscorer.

Swansea City's Wilfried Bony could be a man in demand from a number of sides in the transfer window

Charlie Austin is a fairytale footballer. Non league players with hopes of making the big time will look at Charlie and believe their dreams can come true. What an impact he has made. If you had asked me before the start of the season, I’d have said he would struggle to get five goals. He already has 12.

Harry Kane is another player who has surprised me. Tottenham are lucky to have him. He has come from nowhere and is helping them to make up for mistakes they have made in the transfer market. His goals have given them a chance of the top four. Kane has become their talisman and he leaves everything on the pitch. Spurs fans sing ‘he is one of us’, and he looks like a fan playing football. My boss said to me a few months ago: ‘Mention Harry Kane for England in your column.’ I laughed. I’m not laughing any more.

Harry Kane has impressed since getting his chance at Spurs

Steve Bruce is struggling at Hull. They need to hold their nerve. He has brought in players who are all very similar and who don’t look capable of rolling up their sleeves. Michael Dawson was a good signing, but is injured and Tom Huddlestone and Jake Livermore are off the boil. They will be okay, I just hope the board doesn’t panic.

Hull boss Steve Bruce is having a tough time at the KC Stadium - but they should be good enough to stay up

Roberto Martinez won’t change his style. Everton are also struggling and one or two of his players need to work harder, but Martinez believes in his way of playing and won’t mix it up. I’m a fan and I’m sure he will get it right.

Roberto Martinez is unlikely to change his style at Everton - some of his players need to work harder

The best addition of the transfer window will be… Daniel Sturridge. Don’t underestimate the impact he will have on the Liverpool team when he returns later this month. If he can stay fit, they can beat Arsenal for fourth place. They’ve had a wretched first half of the season, but Liverpool are only five points off the top four and play bottom club Leicester today. Sturridge can turn their season around.
