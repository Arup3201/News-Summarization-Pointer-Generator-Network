Sexually transmitted diseases are on the rise and syphilis is at an all-time high, new research suggests.

The report was done at University of New South Wales Kirby Institute for Infection and Immunity in Society, in Sydney. It found that more than 1760 syphilis notifications were recorded, a 34 per cent increase since 2009, and the highest ever recorded rates.

The demographic with the highest rates was gay men aged between 20 and 39. Nearly 600 of these were in NSW.

The report-HIV, VIRAL Hepatitis and and Sexually Transmittable Infections in Australia-also found the has been an 80 per cent increase in in gonorrhoea instances in the past five years.

The disease was almost non-existent in the 1990’s head of surveillance and evaluation at Kirby Institute David Wilson, reports Sydney Morning Herald.

‘Most people do consider syphilis to be a rare and isolated disease, not really of relevance today, and even 15 years ago that was true,’ he said.

‘But we’ve seen a real resurgence, particularly amongst gay men.’

Communicable Diseases Branch acting director Christine Selvey said she was stumped at the rapid increase.

‘We don’t really understand why it is.’

The report also estimated that 220 people in NSW died after contracting Hepatitis C, more than double the number recorded in 2003. 

Professor Wilson said he expects the hepatitis C death rates to continue to rise.
