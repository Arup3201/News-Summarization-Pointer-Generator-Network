The NHS will continue to sell patients’ medical records despite its woeful history of blunders over the illegal use of private data.

The Mail revealed in June that files had been sold to insurance firms and other companies without proper checks and balances.

The data – including highly personal details of patient diagnoses, dates of birth and postcodes – was used to help calculate insurance premiums.

But the deputy chairman of the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC), the body in charge of such records, said last night that the NHS would continue the controversial practice.

Justifying the decision in a newspaper article, Sir Nick Partridge said: ‘We must make sure there are no surprises for the public about how their information is being used, that they have a choice in this and that we are honest about the balance of risk. 

'Every single one of us has a part to play in making sure we get this right.’

The move is likely to anger campaigners, especially as a report published today after an eight-month inquiry will confirm that tens of thousands of records were wrongly passed to third parties.

Sir Nick told the Daily Telegraph that proper checks were now in place to prevent misuse of records.

He said firms wanting to use NHS records would now have ‘to be clear about the purpose they wish to use the information for, and the ability of their own company or organisation to uphold fair and secure processes’.

He added: ‘Until then we cannot supply health and care data.’ 

The NHS will not renew a controversial bonus scheme awarding GPs £55 every time they diagnose a new patient with dementia.

The scheme was introduced last month to tackle poor rates of diagnosis in the elderly. But it was branded unethical by some GPs and campaigners, who claimed it could undermine patients’ trust.

An open letter signed by more than 50 doctors argued that false diagnosis as a result of the sum would have ‘tragic consequences’. 

NHS England chief Simon Stevens confirmed yesterday the scheme would not be renewed when it ends in March.

He told Pulse magazine the bonus was a ‘one-time’ chance to boost diagnoses. 

When asked if he had regrets over the scheme, he said it was too early for hindsight. An NHS England spokesman said the scheme was never intended to run past March.

Officials admitted earlier this year that the details of up to 1.3million patients had effectively gone missing on at least two occasions as no record was kept of which businesses they were passed on to.

After the scandal broke, changes were introduced under the Care Act in a bid to make sure third parties can only get their hands on medical data if they can prove it will be used to improve the nation’s health.

An earlier investigation by the HSCIC found that patient data was handed to 178 firms a total of 588 times between 2005 and 2012.

The companies handed data included management consultants and the private healthcare company Bupa.

The insurers involved used the data to help set premiums by looking at who got certain illnesses, at what age and in which areas.

The NHS charged administration costs and did not make a profit.

Sir Nick, who led the HSCIC investigation, said in June there had been ‘significant lapses’ where officials had not properly checked how the third parties were planning to use the records.

And he said the public would ‘simply not tolerate vagueness about medical records that may be intensely private to them’.

The expert also said public health officials needed to earn the public’s trust by showing great care in the way their records were handled.
