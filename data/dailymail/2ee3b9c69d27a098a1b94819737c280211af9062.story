She has now launched a website, Libidina, to provide advice on issues such as erectile dysfunction, painful sex and masturbation - recommending products that can help for each.

She told MailOnline: 'We take sexual function for granted, but sometimes, for whatever reason, it can become ‘different or change’.  

'This may be due to many reasons, even down to familiarity with your partner or routine. But can also be caused by physical or mental health conditions.'

Libidina asked 50 people, some individuals and some couples, to try a variety of devices.

Here, exclusively for MailOnline, Wendy reveals which ones really will boost your sex life....1. SORAYA

6 second orgasm: The Soraya has 
eight unique vibration modes and can work as a massager

'This is an amazing device with eight unique vibration modes. It's great as a massager and for obtaining either a clitoral or vaginal orgasm…. or both!

Fully rechargeable, lockable and waterproof, it is quiet and beautifully made - one to replace the redundant Rabbit.

One of our researchers, 42-year-old Jess, a mother of two, had never had a vaginal orgasm. We recommended the Soraya and gave her some innovative tips and advice - she had an orgasm in six seconds!

She was overwhelmed and now is finding ways to achieve this with her husband, with a little help from her Soraya. 2. THE TIANI 3

Fun outside the bedroom: The Tiani 3 will give your love life an 'extra charge'

A fantastic device, ideal for couples and really gives your love life an extra charge.

It has eight stimulation modes - two are remote controlled - for added excitement and anticipation. Fully rechargeable and waterproof.

It's a great item for ‘fun’ outside the bedroom as no one else will know! Has a wireless range of 12 meters.

Our testers Rob and Sue, who are in their 50s, said: 'We had a great time using this when we were out for dinner and when we got home - WOW!’

3. HULA BEADS

Progress: Hula Beeds are 'fantastic at helping to strengthen a woman¿s pelvic floor', says Wendy

These
 are designed for both single and couples use. The remote control with 
SenseMotion Technology, if used with a partner, adds extra excitement 
because you don’t know what is coming next! It's also fantastic at 
helping to strengthen a woman’s pelvic floor.

By
 using low speed and working your muscles against the pulsation, it 
strengthens the muscles and so helps with issues such as incontinence as
 well as heightening sexual awareness.

Our
 tester, 39-year-old Claire, a mother-of-four, suffers with stress 
incontinence and lack of sensation. After using the Hula Beads every day
 for six weeks, she reported an 'amazing difference', getting her 
bladder weakness under control and finding sex more pleasurable.

4. ELITE VACUUM DEVICE

The Elite Vacuum Device helps men with erection problems and those suffering Peyronie's disease - a curved penis

A
 simple but hugely effective vacuum device which has several purposes. 
It's fantastic for achieving erections, which the constriction rings 
help to maintain, enabling a man to have intercourse.

It's
 also used for ‘exercising’ the penis after surgery and widely used to 
treat Peyronies - a bend or curve in the penis which prevents a man from
 having sex because it causes both him and his partner pain.

This
 device can help men have a satisfying relationship without the need for
 surgery. George, 62, was considering surgery but got in touch with us 
before for advice. Before using the pump, he wasn't able to have sex - 
but six months on, the curve has straightened and he's having 
intercourse again.

5. LILLY

Discreet: The Lilly (left) 'packs a powerful punch' and fits in the palm of your hand, while the Liv 2 (right) can help women who experience pain during intercourse

The original pleasure object. Small and discreet, it sits in the palm of your hand, but packs a powerful punch. It builds up intensity, with five exciting vibration modes and can be used alone or with a partner. 

Our tester, 25-year-old Louise, who is single, said: 'It's brilliant! It does just what I need, no stupid shape or fancy extras. Not having a partner you need something to fulfil your needs and this does just that.'

6. LIV 2This
 is a small to mid-sized vibrator which is an excellent first device if 
you've not used one before. It's also great for those who have problems 
with pain during intercourse.

Pain
 can affect many young women and some can't even insert tampons due to 
the pain. Liv 2 is the ideal device for helping to deal with this and, 
with expert advice, it can help women who would avoid sex for fear of 
the pain.

Chloe,
 22, couldn't have a sexual relationship or insert a tampon, but eight 
weeks after using the device - with guidance from a clinical expert - 
she has managed to have sex.'

7. ORA

The Ora has been designed to give the same sensations experienced during oral sex

One of the newest devices on the market, it offers seductive swirls and pulsations on and 
around the clitoris. It has been designed to give the same sensations 
experienced during oral sex, has 10 varied stimulation patterns and rotates and vibrates.

Marie,
 67, hadn't had a sexual partner for more than 15 years and bought it 
because she only wanted external pleasure. She's described it as 
'excellent'.

7. THE MIA

The Mia has six stimulation modes and charges via a USB port

This is a nifty little device for busy women who want instant results. It recharges via a USB port and looks like a lipstick, so it is not out of place in your cosmetics bag.

The intense vibrations hit the spot with six adjustable stimulation modes. Some women won't leave home without it. 8. TOR 2

The Tor is a 'useful device for men who have sensation issues or problems maintaining erections'

A rechargeable waterproof ring for both partners that can also be used by a man to help with sensation and to maintain an erection. Worn during lovemaking, it brings pleasure for both partners. It has six stimulation modes and is the most powerful of its kind.

It's also a useful device for men who have sensation issues. By gradually increasing sensitivity over a period of time, men can regain more feeling.

John, 47, bought a Tor 2 after surgery left him with erection and orgasm problems. He and his partner Roz found it helped both of them with pleasure and satisfaction.'

9. LYLA 2

An upgraded version of the leading remote-controlled massager, it turns on pleasure even at a distance. For internal or external use, it has 50 per cent more vibration intensity and is a breath-taking device.

A simple movement of the controller changes the mode or intensity. Josh and Lauren trialled the device after their marriage fell into difficultly - they wanted to offer each other surprises in the bedroom.

'They raved about it - particularly used with the massage candles and stone.'
