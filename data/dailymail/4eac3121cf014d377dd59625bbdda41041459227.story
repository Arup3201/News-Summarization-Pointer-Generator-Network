Police are hunting a gang of thugs who deliberately drowned a pony by pushing it into a lake.

Horrified onlookers spotted the group of 12 men and boys forcing the animal and its trap into the 8ft-deep water.

Officers are also investigating reports the yobs used sticks to beat the two-year-old piebald cob pony as it tried desperately to haul itself out of Hawley Lake, near Farnborough, Hampshire,  on Saturday afternoon.

Killers: The gang deliberately drowned a pony by pushing it into Hawley Lake, in Pinewood Park, near Yateley in Hampshire, until it was completely submerged

They tried to push in two other ponies as well, both also attached to their traps.

A horrified 21-year-old walker trying
to rescue the first pony was kicked in the head and knocked unconscious
by the panicking animal.

He was treated at the scene by paramedics 
before being taken to Frimley Park Hospital but has since been 
discharged.

Unable to clamber out, the pony tried
to swim to the other side but was dragged down by the wooden trap and 
drowned.

The body was removed from the lake by
Hampshire Fire Service firefighters with the help of Ministry of 
Defence divers, who use the lake, in a three-hour operation.

Crime scene: The RSPCA and Hampshire Police have launched a joint investigation into the incident

Hampshire Police also launched a joint investigation with the RSPCA to find those responsible.

Sophie Wilkinson, of the RSPCA, said:
‘It’s an extremely cruel and shocking thing that these people have done
and we have no idea why they did it.

‘It seems a gang of 12 men and boys 
lined up three ponies and traps and tried to force them into the water –
they succeeded with this one.’

Police spokesman Alan Smith added: 
‘When the attempt to push a second and third pony into the lake failed, 
the group of people drove them and their traps away in the direction of 
Yateley.

‘There were a number of people around at the time including dog walkers and fishermen and we would like to hear from witnesses.’

A dozen travellers are said to have 
arrived at Hawley Lake in Pinewood Park, near Yateley in Hampshire, at 
around 5pm on Saturday.

Mr Smith said the 21-year-old fisherman who tried unsuccessfully to save the drowning pony was taken by ambulance to Frimley Park Hospital where he was treated for head injuries and bruising.

He added: 'He sustained the injuries as the horse kicked out and was knocked unconscious.'
