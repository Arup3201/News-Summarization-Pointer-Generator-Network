Labour leader Ed Miliband today warned than 1million voters have disappeared ahead of the election.

He blamed the government for making changes to the voter registration system which means hundreds of thousands of young people have lost their 'sacred democratic rights'.

But Labour's general election handbook, sent to candidates across the country, tells them not to bother with families where no-one has ever voted and instead focus on people who might want Mr Miliband in Number 10.

Labour leader Ed Miliband blamed the government for making changes to the voter registration system which means hundreds of thousands of young people have lost their 'sacred democratic rights'

Labour has calculated that almost one million people have dropped off the electoral register in the last year as a result of what the party says was the 'hasty' way the Government introduced individual voter registration - intended to reduce electoral fraud - without proper safeguards.

It says that many of the missing voters are young people - in part due to the decision to end the block registration by universities and colleges of students living in halls of residence.

University cities and towns such as Cardiff, Liverpool, Newcastle, Southampton, Leicester, Nottingham, Brighton and Hull have all seen five-figure falls in the numbers of registered voters, according to Labour, while in London the numbers are down by almost 100,000.

Labour's General Handbook advises candidates on which houses to target when knocking on doors

Mr Miliband promises to lead a 'national mission' to ensure young voters were able to hold the coalition leaders to account on May 7.

In a highly-critical speech, Mr Miliband said: 'This government has betrayed young people. Having broken their promises on tuition fees to young people, having failed to build the economy that will work for them, having short-changed their future, this is David Cameron and Nick Clegg's final insult to young people.

'They are sitting by and watching hundreds of thousands of young people in our country lose their sacred democratic rights. We will not allow this scandal to happen and no right-thinking person should either.'

But the handbook sent to Labour candidates warns against 'watsing too much volunteer time' on people unlikely to vote.

It states: 'The only people you should not be prioritising are those who live in a household where:… no-one has ever voted, no-one has a postal vote, no-one has turned 18 since 2010 and no-one has moved in since 2010.'

Activists are also told to steer clear of homes when people plan to vote Tory or have 'formally asked us never to contact them again'.

Labour's attack on the electoral roll numbers has also been rubbished by the Electoral Commission.

An Electoral Commission spokesman said: 'It has always been known that some areas with large student populations would initially see a fall in the number of students on their register and that extra effort would be needed to ensure as many as possible are on the register before the April 20 deadline.

'Electoral registration officers all have detailed plans in place to target areas with high student populations. This work will continue right up until the registration deadline.'

The guidance recommends that activists do not prioritise households where no-one has ever voted

Lib Dem MP Tom Brake said that many of the 'missing' student voters would still be on the electoral roll but would have previously been registered twice.

'Labour must have forgotten they began the policy of individual electoral registration while they were in government and still support it in principle,' he said.

'Instead of scaremongering, Labour should be working with their own local authorities to ensure that the large amount of money available is spent helping people, particularly students, register to vote.'

Darren Hughes, Deputy Chief Executive of the Electoral Reform Society, said: 'It's good to hear Ed Miliband join the chorus of voices warning about the number of people in danger of falling off the electoral register. While it was sensible to move on from the Victorian-era system of household registration, there have been real concerns about making the switch so close to an election.

'It's now the duty of everyone concerned, including central government, local authorities, the voluntary sector and all the political parties, to find those missing millions and make sure they don't lose out on their most basic civic right.'
