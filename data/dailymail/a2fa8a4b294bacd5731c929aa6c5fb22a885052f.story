After being fourth official at Stamford Bridge on Saturday afternoon, Kevin Friend completed his lively weekend with another game of declined penalty appeals at St Mary's.

The first came in the opening minute as Filip Djuricic went down very easily under close attention from Liverpool's Emre Can.

However many replays are viewed it is not conclusive so I support Friend on this occasion.

Filip Djuricic should have been awarded a penalty when he was brought down by Liverpool's Joe Allen 

But I felt that the same Saints forward should have had a penalty when he was brought down by Joe Allen with the home side trailing 1-0.

Liverpool should have had a penalty of their own just after the half-hour mark when Jose Fonte clearly slid through Raheem Sterling after clipping the ball.

There were another two or three good penalty appeals, though none of them were clear.

As for the Simon Mignolet handball, all the pundits seemed to agree it was accidental and so do I.

If you look back, Friend missed one penalty for each team and as they balance out, they do not really become an issue.

Friend will not be censured or criticised by PGMOL (Professional Game Match Officials Limited). In the context of the season he actually wasn't too bad.

Friend missed legitimate penalty calls for both sides but, in the contest of the season , he wasn't too bad

Tottenham Hotspur vs West Ham

This was a very interesting game technically at White Hart Lane for Jon Moss and his assistants.

The second West Ham goal should, in my opinion, have been disallowed for offside but I could see why it wasn't. Mark Noble crossed the ball to the far post where Cheikhou Kouyate jumped for it in front of Danny Rose.

Kouyate couldn't reach it and the ball fell to Diafra Sakho who scored from a tight angle. Whilst Kouyate did not touch the ball, he was in an offside position when the ball was crossed and he certainly affected his opponent Rose and so should have been penalised.

The late equaliser for Tottenham came when Alex Song needlessly fouled Harry Kane and his reaction to Moss's decision told you it was accurate. 

Given the time that elapsed, Moss probably allowed a little more time for the penalty to be taken which law stipulates and he should be pleased with his performance which contributed to an entertaining game.
