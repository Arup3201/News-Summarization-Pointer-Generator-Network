The highly-anticipated Thursday opening of a time capsule that been hidden in the head of a lion statue atop a historical landmark for more than a century yielded nothing but a red book.

The Bostonian Society had expected the time capsule to include letters, newspaper clippings and other items from 1901, the year it was placed in the statue on the Old State House.

Papers were found, along with the red book inside the copper box roughly the size of a modern shoebox.

No crown jewel: The lion statue was placed atop Boston's Old State House in 1901 and the shoebox-sized metal box placed inside and promptly forgotten

The book had no visible markings, and nothing was taken out of the box because of the items' fragile condition. So, the contents of the book remain a mystery, for now.

The inside of the box and its contents — there was no mold or water damage — thrilled society President Brian LeMay. 

LeMay said he was 'absolutely delighted' with the conditions inside the box.

The time capsule was sealed inside the lion's head since 1901 and then forgotten — until recently.  Rumors of its existence were confirmed last month when the statue was taken down from the Old State House for refurbishing.

The delicate removal of the box took place at a sculpting studio in suburban Woburn.

Robert Shure, owner of Skylight Studio, first removed a crown atop the copper and gold-leaf lion's head, cut cables holding the box in place inside the head, and removed the rectangular box, which weighed between five and 10 pounds and measured 8-by-12 inches in length and about 6 inches deep, according to Shure.

The society, which manages the Old State House, first learned about the possible existence of the time capsule years ago from the great-great-granddaughter of Samuel Rogers, a craftsman who had worked on building renovations and was believed to have placed the time capsule in the lion's head and catalogued its contents. A 1901 article from The Boston Globe surfaced later, alluding to contents of a copper box 'which will prove interesting when the box is opened many years hence.'

Elizabeth Roscio, the Boston Society's archivist, said the box will be brought to an environmentally-controlled setting where the contents can be carefully removed and studied. They will be put on public display at a later date.

One of Boston's most popular tourist attractions, the Old State House has a storied history. It was once the seat of English rule in the northern colonies, and the original lion statue and an accompanying unicorn statue symbolized the unification of England and Scotland.

It was just outside the building that British regulars opened fire on a crowd of protesters in 1770, killing five people in what would become known as the Boston Massacre.

In the summer of 1776, the newly-signed Declaration of Independence was read for the first time to Bostonians from a balcony of the building, which would later serve as the first seat of Massachusetts government.

The plan is to put a new time capsule in the lion's head, this one made of titanium. The society is currently soliciting suggestions of what to put in it, but said one item will be a medal from the ill-fated 2013 Boston Marathon.

Red book: Inside was a red book. The experts on hand declined to even inspect it, citing its fragile condition

Bostonians have whispered about the existence of a time capsule inside the head of the lion statue placed atop the city's Old State House for years. 

The rumors began when a woman purporting to be the descendant of the statue's sculptor came forward, but the denizens of the Massachusetts town have had to wait until now to know for sure.

A 1901 article in the Boston Globe reported on the original placement of the statue, as well as the box inside that has nbw been found:

The work of the coppersmith is completed, and one of the last things he did was to seal a copper box, which is placed in the head of the lion, and which contains contributions from state and city officials, the Boston daily newspapers, the name of the maker of the lion and unicorn, and others, which will prove interesting when the box is opened many years hence.B
