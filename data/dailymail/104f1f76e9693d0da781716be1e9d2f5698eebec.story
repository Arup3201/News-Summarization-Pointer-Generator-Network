In the days long before David Beckham was a Manchester United icon, England captain and a global megastar, he was a scrawny, unproven 19-year-old earning four hundred quid a week in the Third Division.

Back in February 1995, Sir Alex Ferguson decided the teenager, who had just one first-team outing under his belt, needed to prove his mettle in a man's game.

So the young Becks was loaned out to Preston North End for a month to gain the necessary experience and show what he could do with that magic right foot.

David Beckham's contract for his loan spell at Preston North End in February and March 1995. The Manchester United teenager was sent to Deepdale to gain experience and earned £400 a week

And, co-inciding with United's FA Cup fifth round tie at Deepdale this week, the precise details of Beckham's spell there have been revealed.

Paul Bradley, Preston's stadium manager, said Beckham's loan contract is still hanging on the wall of his office at the ground and is a rather unique souvenir of where it all began for the world famous player.

He told the Daily Telegraph: 'David Beckham played down here on loan and I have his contract on my office wall. I was told to get rid of it by a former chairman, but I was sensible enough to keep it.'

The official Football Association document shows that Beckham will play for Preston between February 28 and March 27, 1995 and will be paid the princely sum of £400 a week.

Beckham went on to win pretty much every major trophy in the game, including the Champions League in 1999

Beckham played 115 times for England, many as captain, and scored 17 goals for his country

Becks also won the Premier League title on six occasions with Manchester United

But Becks was also in line to receive an additional £50 for every first team appearance made, plus all his accommodation costs and expenses were to be covered.

In the end, he played in five league fixtures and scored twice, both in spectacular circumstances. One was directly from a corner and the other was one of those trademark free-kicks.

After a month, he returned to Old Trafford, broke into the first team and, well, the rest is history. But to think that Beckham didn't fancy the idea of a loan move.

'I was shocked,' he wrote wrote in his autobiography My World. 'I thought it was a sign that the club was trying to get rid of a player.'

It took some reassurance from Ferguson to persuade Beckham that the temporary change of scene would forward his career. How right he was.
