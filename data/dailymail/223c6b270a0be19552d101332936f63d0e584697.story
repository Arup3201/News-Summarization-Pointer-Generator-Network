NYPD officers gave a salute to embattled mayor Bill de Blasio as he mounted the steps of the funeral home where the wake is being held for slain officer Wenjian Liu.

The gesture of respect follows weeks of sniping at the mayor from rank-and-file members, culminating in many of them turning their backs to him at the funeral service for Officer Liu's partner, Rafael Ramos. 

Somber NYPD officers flocked to the wake for the slain officer - the second of two men murdered as they patrolled the streets together last month.

Uniformed cops thronged the streets around the Aievoli Funeral Home in Brooklyn, New York to pay their respects to Liu, 32, who will have a full funeral Sunday.

Officer Liu was shot dead alongside Rafael Ramos, whose funeral was last week, as the two sat in their patrol car in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, New York

Respect: NYPD officers gave a salute to de Blasio, seen right next to commissioner Bill Bratton, as they entered a wake for slain officer Wenjian Liu

About face: The gesture came a day after Bratton urged his officers not to turn their backs on the mayor, as some did at the funeral for Liu's partner, Rafael Ramos

Arriving: de Blasio pulls up the the funeral home in a black car, accompanied by aides and police

Entering: The under-fire New York mayor heads into the home. Some officers have circulated an open letter asking the mayor not to attend their funeral should they be killed on duty

Sea of blue: Row upon row of NYPD officers gathered in Brooklyn for the wake of slain Wenjian Liu

Somber: The officers are expecting their second funeral in a week after attending a ceremony for Rafael Ramos, Liu's partner, on December 27

Unity: Pro-police banners and signs were set up in the area around the funeral home where the wake is being held

The two were killed by gunman Ismaaiyl Brinsley, who posted online before that it was a revenge attack for the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, black men killed by police

The murders led to a rift between the NYPD and City Hall, with many officers turning their backs on mayor Bill de Blasio at the funeral of Officer Ramos as a show of frustration.

But New York's top cop, Commissioner Bill Bratton, has urged his officers not to stage a repeat performance, saying such a thing would be 'inappropriate'.

They were urged instead to live up to the department's traditions of 'honor and decency'. 

The message, seen by the New York Post, stated: 'A hero's funeral is about grieving, not grievance.

'I issue no mandates and I make no threats of discipline. But I remind you that when you don the uniform of this department, you are bound by the tradition, honor, and decency that go with it.

Procession: Hundreds of cops gathered for the event, just miles from where the two officers were killed

Hero: Wenjian Liu, right, was one of two officers gunned down by Ismaaiyl Brinsley as they sat in their patrol car

Guards: Officers keep watch over the funeral home. They have been urged by their commissioner, Bill Bratton, not to show disrespect to city mayor Bill de Blasio, lest they cheapen the occasion

Appeal: Commissioner Bill Bratton, center, has urged officers not to turn their backs do Mayor de Blasio, right

Protest: Thousands of officers turned their backs during De Blasio's eulogy at Rafael Ramos' funeral on December 27

'The country’s consciousness of that funeral has focused on an act of disrespect shown by a fraction of those…officers,' he said.

'All officers were painted by it, and it stole the valor, honor, and attention that rightfully belonged to the memory of detective Rafael Ramos’s life and service. 

'That was not the intent, I know. But it was the result.'

Last Saturday, the New York City Police Department buried a hero.

Tens of thousands of officers from our department and hundreds of other departments came to show respect for detective first grade Rafael Ramos.

His family witnessed the kind of love that only his second family in blue could display.

But for the last seven days, the city's and the country's consciousness of that funeral has focused on an act of disrespect shown by a portion of those tens of thousands of officers.

It was not all the officers, and it was not disrespect directed at Detective Ramos.

But all the officers were painted by it, and it stole the valor, honor, and attention that rightfully belonged to the memory of Detective Rafael Ramos's life and sacrifice.

That was not that intent, I know. But it was the result.

On Sunday, we will gather together again, with the rest of New York City and law-enforcement officials nationwide, to mourn for Detective First Grade Wenjian Liu.

We gather to support his parents, his widow, and everyone who is there to remember a life tragically cut short.

The assassination of Detectives Liu and Ramos was an attack on us all.

As a cop, one who lived and worked through the assassination threats of the 1970s, I understand that emotions are high.

I issue no mandates, and I make no threats of discipline.

But I remind you that when you don the uniform of this department, you are bound by the tradition, honor, and decency that go with it.
