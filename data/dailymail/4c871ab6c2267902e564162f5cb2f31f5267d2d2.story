Paul Jewell is seeking legal advice after leaving his position as assistant head coach to Tony Pulis at West Brom just a week after being appointed.  

The former Wigan, Ipswich and Derby manager expressed reservations about his role and on Wednesday released a statement denying his exit was by mutual consent. 

A statement said: '(My exit) was not by mutual consent and it is in the hands of my lawyer. I will not be making any further comment at this stage.'

Gerry Francis replaces Jewell having worked with Pulis at both Stoke City and Crystal Palace

The shock departure has seen Pulis turn to Gerry Francis, whom he worked with at Stoke and Crystal Palace.

The former QPR and Tottenham manager has been helping West Brom informally on a part-time basis since the 7-0 win over Gateshead earlier this month. 

Francis said on Wednesday he was unaware of the reasons behind Jewell's departure.

He told Sky Sports: 'I've no idea. He was there Saturday, I was there Saturday at the game... I don't really know what the situation is from that point of view. I only found out myself last night.'  

West Brom released a statement confirming Jewell’s departure on Tuesday night – and announcing the arrival of Francis.

'Gerry and I have worked well together at both Stoke and Crystal Palace and it was always part of my plan for him to join me at Albion,' said Pulis.

'I value his insight and experience of the very highest levels of our game and I’m delighted that he is now on board. We have an agreement that we have employed in the past and suits us both.' 

Francis said: 'I’ve been working with Tony since the Gateshead game and now I’m happy I have finalised a deal. I like the set-up. Albion have a good training ground, good facilities – but just as was the case at Stoke and Palace, it’s vitally important for the club to retain Premier League status.

'There’s going to be a number of teams involved in the situation. We’ve had three decent results, but there’s a lot of work to do with the side and Tony is obviously looking to strengthen if he can. But I’m looking forward to the challenge.’
