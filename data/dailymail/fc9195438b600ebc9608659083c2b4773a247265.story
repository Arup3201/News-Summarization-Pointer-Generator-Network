Tony Mowbray has been appointed Coventry's new manager, the club have announced.

The former Middlesbrough and Celtic boss replaces Steven Pressley and has signed a contract at the Ricoh Arena until the end of the current season.

Mowbray has been out of work since leaving Middlesbrough in October 2013 and had been keen to return to management.

Chief executive Steve Waggott said on the club's official website: 'We are absolutely delighted to welcome Tony Mowbray to Coventry City as our new manager.

'We've secured the services of a highly-rated, experienced candidate for the job and Tony is a manager who has enjoyed plenty of success at a higher level.

'He has experience in coming into a club in challenging times and steering them through to safety and, on top of that, has enjoyed promotion too.

'We were all very impressed with Tony during the interview process and it speaks volumes that the club are able to attract a manager of Tony's calibre.

'We wanted someone who could come in and hit the ground running because we have 14 important games left in this season and the number one priority is to preserve our League One status.

'We have agreed terms until the end of the season and then, immediately after the final ball is kicked, we can reassess and look at a longer term deal. It was just vital, at this stage, to get the right man in to help steer us through the current situation between now and the end of the season.

'We believe Tony is exactly the right man for Coventry City and everyone here, from supporters to staff, will get right behind him.'

Pressley was sacked last week after the Sky Blues slipped into the Sky Bet League One relegation zone following a 2-2 draw at Sheffield United.

Coventry go to Barnsley on Tuesday sitting just a point above the relegation zone following just one win in their last eight games.

Mowbray, 51, has worked in the Midlands before during a three-year spell at West Brom, where he guided the Baggies to the Barclays Premier League in 2008.
