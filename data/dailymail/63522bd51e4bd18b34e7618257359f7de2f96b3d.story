A Texas woman accused of keeping her severely malnourished five-year-old stepson in a closet under the stairs until he weighed only 29lbs has been charged with felony injury to a child by omission.

Tammi Bleimeyer, 34, from outside Houston, was charged with felony child endangerment last year when the disturbing treatment of the boy, Jordan, came to light after his stepbrother spoke out.

Jordan was visibly emaciated in March 2014, with bones visible through his skin and bruises, according to authorities. He went to pediatric intensive care before regaining health.

Bones were visible through Jordan's bruised skin when he was taken by protective services last spring

Now six, he began kindergarten last year. 

A soiled mattress was found in a closet under the Bleimeyer's home along with a lock. 

Mrs Bleimeyer denied the abuse and said that her 16-year-old biological son was lying because he did not respect his new  24-year-old stepdad, Jordan's biological father, because of the small age difference.

The biological mother of seven is now estranged from husband Bradley Bleimeyer, who was also charged with child endangerment.

Jordan's biological mother Wendy Hall said the boy told her he was fed just a cup of water and a piece of bread every day.

He was also allegedly drugged by his father to keep him quiet when guests were over.

Mrs Bleimeyer posted $30,000 bail on Saturday while her estranged husband Bradley remains in jail on $150,000 bond. He was not charged with the additional felony injury to a child by omission

Child protective services took custody of Jordan and Mrs Bleimeyer's other children.

Ms Hall was granted access to her son while he stayed with an aunt. 

Mrs Bleimeyer's six-week-old baby, which did not show signs of abuse, was taken from her in October after an Amber Alert for the newborn was issued.

The baby was given to foster care. 

The mother turned herself in to the latest charges Saturday and was released on $30,000 bond, according to KHOU.

Mr Bleimeyer remains in prison with bail set at $150,000 and no new charges have been filed against him. 

Their next court appearance is set for March 2, according to the Houston Chronicle. 

Thousands of dollars were donated to the care of Jordan after an appeal on the Dr Phil show. 

First degree felonies are punishable by up to life in prison.
