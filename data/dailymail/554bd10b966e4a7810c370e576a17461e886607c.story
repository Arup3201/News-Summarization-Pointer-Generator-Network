Murderer: Adam Cross, 35, was originally jailed for grievous bodily harm but has now been convicted of the more serious crime after his victim died

A violent attacker whose victim died three years after being left in a vegetative state by his vicious assault has been convicted of murder.

Adam Cross, 35, launched his unprovoked attack on Joseph Starzacher at a takeaway after a night out in 2007.

He was originally jailed for grievous bodily harm, and has been in prison since 2008.

But, in an unprecedented move, he has now also been found guilty of murdering Mr Starzacher, who died of his wounds in 2010.

In a new trial last week, Winchester Crown Court heard how Joseph was out with friends in Salisbury, Wiltshire, when Cross 
began shouting abuse at him in a takeaway.

He punched him to the floor and then knocked him unconscious with a brutal kick to the head.

CCTV
 footage showed that Joseph had initially tried to get up after first 
being knocked down and it was the kick to the head that had knocked him 
out.

He was rushed to 
hospital in Southampton and had life-saving brain surgery, but never 
recovered.

Mr Starzacher, a father of one, needed constant care and had to move to a home in the wake of the unprovoked attack.

After three years in a vegetative state, he died in August 2010 from pneumonia caused by his immobility.

Medical experts concluded that the 37-year-old's death was linked to the head injury Cross caused.Cross was found guilty following a fresh trial last week and is due to be sentenced at a later date.

The full extent of the sentence Cross will receive is to be decided at a future hearing.

It is believed to be the first time someone convicted of an assault has then be successfully retried for murder after their victim died.

Mr Starzacher's family has spoken of their 'horrific ordeal', and said that the murder conviction will finally allow them to move on.

A joint statement said: 'Joseph was a kind, gentle and caring person who abhorred violence. We as a family have lost a lovely young man in the prime of his life.

'To see Joseph's life taken away in such an act of unprovoked, mindless violence has had a devastating and heartbreaking effect on all those who knew him.

'We have had to endure seeing Joseph locked in his body unable to communicate for three years watching his deterioration that eventually led to his death in 2010.

'This has been deeply distressing for us all but especially for his daughter Megan who was the apple of his eye.

'Despite going through two trials and two appeal processes we can now begin the process of moving on from this horrific ordeal knowing that Adam Cross, the person responsible for our grief, has been found guilty of murder.'Â 

Cross was initially handed a life 
sentence, with a minimum term of six years, in January 2008. But an 
appeal saw his life sentence quashed and replaced with an indefinite 
term of imprisonment with a minimum of five years. The murder sentence 
is likely to be significantly harsher.

Speaking after the court case, Detective Sergeant Pete Ritson, who worked on the case from the start said that the family had been devastated by the attack.

He said: 'Joseph was only 34 when Cross assaulted him in an entirely unprovoked attack, there was no reason for Cross to take such action.

'Joseph effectively lost his life that night, he never recovered and spent the next three years in a specialist nursing home with 24-hour medical care. The effect on his family was devastating.

'Cross was serving the initial sentence for grievous bodily harm with intent, but following Joseph's death it is right and proper that he was put before the courts to stand trial for his murder.

'This case is a stark reminder of the serious consequences of violence. Joseph lost his life and his young daughter lost her dad because of the actions of Adam Cross.

'We are content that justice has been done for Joseph and we hope that his family can finally find some peace of mind.'
