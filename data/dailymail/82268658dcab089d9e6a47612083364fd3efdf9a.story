Derek Curran is being investigated amid allegations he had a relationship with a student and fathered a love child with her. He has not been charged with any offence - and police say the probe is in early stages

A headteacher is being investigated over allegations he fathered a love child with a student, police confirmed.

Derek Curran, 53, has been suspended from his current school - Castlebrae Community High in Edinburgh - amid allegations of sexual misconduct.

However, the police investigation is expected to focus on his time in charge at another school in the city, Forrester High, where he worked for six years.

Mr Curran has not been charged with any offence and the pupil who made the complaint is understood not to have attended either school.

The woman is thought to have told officers she fell pregnant during a relationship spanning several years - and alleged that a later paternity test showed Mr Curran was the father.

Now in her 20s, it is thought she gave birth after her 18th birthday.

The allegations against Mr Curran only came to light as a result of a separate police inquiry.

A source, who did not want to be named, told the Edinburgh News: 'The student says she fell pregnant during their relationship, which lasted a number of years since she was at school, and she became pregnant.

'She’s had a paternity test and it confirmed Curran was the father.'

A Police Scotland spokesman confirmed the force had launched an inquiry which was at an 'early stage' but was unable to comment further.

He said: 'Police are aware of the suspension of the headteacher at Castlebrae High School and are currently carrying out an investigation.'

The development - described as 'very rare' by a union source - has sparked shock among parents.

Susan Heron, vice-chairwoman of Castlebrae High parent council, said: 'It’s an absolute mess.

'I think the department have took the right action by removing these people while the investigation is done.

The probe will focus on the time Mr Curran was head of Forrester High in Edinburgh, pictured, it is thought. The student, believed to have given birth around her 18th birthday, is not thought to have been a pupil at the school

'We had a meeting with the new headteacher and concluded that what’s important is that the school continues to run.

'Hopefully this mess that’s unfolding will be taken away from the school, because it’s really nothing to do with the actual school. Let’s get on and finish the school year.'

Mr Curran joined Castlebrae Community High last summer to oversee the secondary and its feeder primary schools.

He was given the job of turning around the school after council chiefs pulled back from controversial plans to close it amid poor exam results and failing rolls.

Officials had recommended the school - which had some of the worst exam results, truancy and exclusion rates in Scotland - should close, with pupils moved to other secondaries.

Mr Curran has been suspended from Castlebrae High School, where he currently works. He joined the school last year and is credited with improving the establishment substantially

But Mr Curran has been credited with leading a revival in the school’s fortunes, after introducing a range of measure to boost the once-failing institution.

Mr Curran was not available for comment.

Staff at Castlebrae High were told about the decision to suspend Mr Curran last Monday by the council’s head of schools, Andy Gray.

Grace Vickers, previously head at St Thomas of Aquin’s High, has taken the reins at Castlebrae until the end of term.

A city council spokesman added: 'We will continue to co-operate fully with the police inquiry.'
