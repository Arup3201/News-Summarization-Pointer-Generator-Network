A nine-year-old girl with cerebral palsy came first in a triathlon on Sunday after completing the event with the help of friends and family - especially her mom.

A brain injury after she was born very premature left Cecilia Neimann from Lexexa, Kansas with severe cerebral palsy.

Mom Debbie Neimann vowed to do as much as she could to make her daughter’s life as normal as possible.

‘All she wants is to be like any other nine-year-old. She wants to be swimming, she wants to be biking, she wants to be running just like any other kid that age,’ she told KSHB-TV.

The pair competed in Sunday’s UCP Shawnee Mission Triathlon, which for the first time had a Challenged Athlete division.

Cecilia is the first person to ever win the category's first place medal.

Her grandmother pushed her in a special stroller for the running leg of the triathlon, while Cecilia rode in a bike trailer pulled by a family friend for the cycling.

Mom Debbie swam the race's 500 meter leg, pulling 55-pound Cecilia in a raft. The pair had trained together for months.

‘It really makes her feel like she's not as disabled, and, as a mom, that's all I want her to feel is normal as possible,’ she told KSHB-TV.

Debbie, who is the development coordinator for United Cerebral Palsy of Greater Kansas City, said she was inspired by a father-son team who'd done an Ironman triathlon together.

‘I can hear her say, “Momma, go,” and the smiles and stuff and anything that’s bothering me just melts away because it’s so inspiring,’ she told FOX 4.
