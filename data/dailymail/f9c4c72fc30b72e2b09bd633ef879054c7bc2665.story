Arsene Wenger has warned Per Mertesacker he cannot guarantee him an automatic return to the team.

World Cup winner Mertesacker was dropped after an awful defensive display by Arsenal in the Champions League defeat by Monaco last week.

Gabriel, signed in January from Villarreal, came in for his first Barclays Premier League start against Everton on Sunday and impressed.

Per Mertesacker has been told there is no guarantee he'll return to the Arsenal defence soon

Wenger said: 'Like everybody, we are all here to serve the club and raise above our own interest. He has played many games, has a fantastic mentality, he has great mental stature, absolutely remarkable, and his contribution to the team has been excellent up to now.'

There were no assurances he would return at QPR on Wednesday from Wenger, who added: 'I cannot tell you, I have not decided yet. Honestly.'

As for Gabriel, the Arsenal boss added: 'We bought him to play regularly and of course, that is the target for him. His English is not perfect yet. Yes, he understands more than he talks.

'He has shown that he is a defender who is committed, focused and can integrate well in our defensive style. Overall his first game was a very positive one.'

The French boss also gave updates on Aaron Ramsey and Francis Coquelin, with both in contention to play on Wednesday night.

Ramsey hasn't played since the beginning of February, while Coquelin was forced off against Everton after suffering a broken nose.

The French midfielder would need a face mask if he were to play against Chris Ramsey's relegation candidates. 

Aaron Ramsey has not played for the Gunners since their clash against Leicester in early February
