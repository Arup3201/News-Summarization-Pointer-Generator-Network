Billy Joe Saunders labelled Chris Eubank Jnr a 'c***' after beating his rival on points.

Saunders retained his British, Commonwealth and European middleweight titles by winning the bout at the ExCel Arena on Saturday.

The 25-year-old revealed he has tremendous respect for Eubank Jnr but stopped short at praising his fellow Brit's personality.

Saunders said: 'Deep down I respect him as a fighter. You have to have bottle to put youself through agony for 7-8 weeks and go away and train.

'I still think he's a c*** but what can you do. I've beat him. He said he was prepared to die in the ring to defeat his unbeaten record but I've just taken it and there's nothing he can do about it.'

Saunders admitted he could be keen on setting up a rematch with Eubank Jnr in the future but revealed he has 'big things' ahead of him.

'I wouldn't say no to a rematch,' added Saunders. 'He said it was a fair decision and the better man won. There were no arguments or disappointments from me. It was close, he pushed me but I felt I won the fight.

'My jab was working perfectly but then I sort of got involved a little bit. I was sticking to my boxing but then I was probably listening to him talking.

'I suppose it was a game plan and his dad probably told him. I got in a little bit of a mix with him but then the next thing I know I'm slugging it inside.

'His dad mentioned the referee in two or three interviews. He said how he should "watch over Billy Joe".

'Not saying he done a bad job but I think he could have done a bit more for me. This was a big, big fight. I've got big things ahead of me.

'He's at the back now and forgot about. The same as I beat [John] Ryder and [Nick] Blackwell. People were saying why did I say I was going to retire if he beat me but I said it because fighters like him shouldn't be beating me.'
