A driver had to be rescued from his Porsche by two bystanders after he reversed the sports car into a dyke.

The eyewitnesses jumped into the water in Coltishall, Norfolk and dragged the man out of his vehicle to safety.

The freak accident on Tuesday afternoon happened when the un-named motorist tried to reverse into a boat moored off the River Bure, and drove into the dyke instead.

Embarrassing: The sports car's driver had to be pulled out of his vehicle by two helpful bystanders

Two men working on a boat nearby saw the accident and went to act as the Porsche began to sink into the 4ft-deep ditch.

Mark Platten and Sam Hall jumped in and helped the driver get out of his sports car, then hauled him out of the water.

Mr Hall was walking along the river bank when his attention was drawn by a large splash.

'I heard a big revving of an engine and a bang where it had hit the side of a boat and the Porsche was suddenly sitting on the water,' he said.

'We were trying to explain to the driver to get out. I don't know whether he was in shock, or whether the door was stuck and he couldn't get out.'

Rescue: The car was later retrieved from the dyke and driven away from the scene of the accident

The rescuers used the boat that the car had crashed into as a platform to reach the driver.

'The car was going down slowly and we thought he was not going to get out - so Mark jumped in and it took a bit of an effort do get the door open,' Mr Hall added.

'When the door opened it went down quickly and we pulled him out just in time before his head went under.

'He was in shock and I guess his foot must have slipped on the accelerator.

'It was something like out of a James Bond film and it all happened pretty quickly.'

The Porsche 911, which dates to 1992, would have had a resale value of up to £22,000 depending on mileage.

It boasts a 3.6l engine with 250bhp, goes from 0-60mph in 5.7 seconds and has a top speed of 161mph.

The driver later returned to the scene to thank his two rescuers after drying off and recovering from the shock.

The tied-up boat suffered a smashed window in the crash.
