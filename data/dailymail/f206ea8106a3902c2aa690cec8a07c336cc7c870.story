A homeless family say they have been forced to live in their car with their pet dog, cats and cockatiel for three months after their home was repossessed.

Deborah Talbot, 41, has been living in the disabled people carrier with her taxi driver partner Glyn Jones, 60, their 23-year-old daughter Rachel and their four pets since July because they say they have nowhere else to go.

Their home in Newport, south Wales was repossesed by the bank after Ms Talbot lost her full-time job working in a supermarket.

Deborah Talbot, with her partner Glyn and their daughter Rachel along with their two cats Cassey and Macey, their dog Fred and cockatiel Samuel. The family and their pets have been living in their car for three months 

Each night the family cram into the car, which taxi driver Mr Jones uses for work since their home was repossessed after Ms Talbot lost her full-time job in a supermarket 

Now she says she has had little luck so far in finding accommodation and have been forced to live in the car as they have no friends or family able to take them in.

Ms Talbot, who now works part-time as a cleaner in a school, said: 'I got evicted by our mortgage company. Newport Council said we weren't a priority, and we weren't allowed to get emergency accommodation because we didn't have any children.

'We has nowhere to go at the time, which meant we ended up in there.'

At night, the family all squeeze into the car loaned to them by the taxi firm Mr Jones works for along with their cats Cassy and Macey, a bird called Samuel and a dog called Fred.

They also have to rely on takeaways and ready-to-eat food as they have no access to a kitchen.

Ms Talbot explained that at night the cats go in the back of the car in a basket, while the cockatiel stays in a cage and the family use sleeping bags.

The family say that they park up at random places where they can get some quiet but are worried about how to keep warm as the cold weather sets in 

They have been using the facilities at Newport Centre for washing and have been keeping their bedding in the lockers there.

While Mr Jones is working driving his taxi during the day, Ms Talbot says she and her daughter walk around the city waiting for him to finish.

Meanwhile friends have helped out taking in the pets during the day, but the family say they come back to them overnight.

Ms Talbot added: 'The chairs can't go down far because we need to make to to ensure we can all get in their to lie down properly.

'It has been quite uncomfortable. We park up at random places where we can get some quiet.

'It has been very cold.'

The family say that they have approached private landlords to try to find accommodation but they are unable to scrape together the money for a bond 

We've approached private landlords but we have had no joy - it's all about finding a bond.

We haven't got the cash coming in to do that as well.

'I have bid on properties from Newport City Homes (a local registered social landlord) but nothing has come of it.'

However, the family are hopeful they will get alternative accommodation soon after arranging a viewing on a property.

A Newport council spokeswoman said: 'Ms Talbot applied under the homeless provisions in July after her home was repossessed.

Her application was assessed correctly and a decision letter was issued on 17 July that accepted she was homeless but not in priority need. There is a right of appeal but this was not requested.

'Advice has been provided to Ms Talbot on numerous occasions including about housing benefit and options for alternative accommodation. We will continue to offer her advice and support as she seeks rehousing.

'We do sympathise with anyone who is made homeless but there is a high demand for housing in the city.'
