A pregnant South Carolina woman accused of driving her car into the ocean with her three children on board will be allowed to receive in-hospital psychiatric care until a doctor says she's fit to return to jail.

Ebony Wilkerson, 32, was given the news during a 10-minute bond hearing Tuesday in Daytona Beach. It was a continuation of a hearing that began last week, however, Judge Leah Case wanted to hear more testimony before making a decision as to whether she required more mental health care.

Wilkerson's defense attorneys also agreed to withdraw a request to reduce her $1.2 million bond on six felony charges — including attempted murder. They can refile it later.

Wilkerson will also receive prenatal care and be allowed supervised exercise time.

Last week, a Florida court heard that Wilkerson tried to harm her unborn child as well as her three children.

The pregnant woman was seen ‘beating her stomach with her fists’ after her arrest, it was claimed in a bond hearing.

The 32-year-old was taken to a psychiatric ward where she was kept for observation after being sectioned under the Baker Act.

She has been charged with attempted 
murder after driving her minivan into the ocean at Daytona Beach. Her 
three children, aged three, nine and 10, were rescued by witnesses and 
lifeguards.

Authorities said
 Wilkerson, who had driven from her home in South Carolina, deliberately
 drove into the ocean while her three kids were strapped inside.

Details
 of her attempt to harm her unborn child came from State Attorney R.J. 
Larizza who said Wilkerson was taken to a psychiatric ward when she was 
seen 'beating her stomach with her fists' after her arrest.

He told a court her unborn child was at risk saying she was 'helpless.'

Chief Assistant Public Defender Craig S. Dyer suggested Wilkerson's actions resulted from inhumane conditions.

He said at the time she was being held naked in an isolation cell.

Dyer argued that Wilkerson should have her $1.2million bond suspended and she should be admitted to Halifax Health for care.

'I believe that Mrs. Wilkerson can be helped,' said Dr. James Moore, a psychiatrist. He described Wilkerson's detention as so restrictive that it will complicate mental health treatment.

'She's limited in her ability even for such things as getting fresh air.'

The judge also heard from Dr. Pamela Carbiener, an obstetrics and gynecology specialist, who said Wilkerson's pregnancy is complicated by several factors and she has risk factors for premature birth.

'I think she has significant high-risk issues,' Carbiener said.

Judge Leah Case declined to release Wilkerson to the hospital at that point.

Unstable: The pregnant South Carolina woman who drove the minivan carrying her three young children into the ocean surf had talked about demons before leaving the house

Safe: A lifeguard carries one of the three children rescued from the minivan

That's when she set up today's follow-up hearing, inviting the defense to provide case law supporting its proposal.

Wilkerson's family has said she drove into the water days after leaving her husband, following 14 years of abuse in South Carolina.

Her children have told investigators she had been behaving erratically since arriving in Florida.

Tourists on the beach caught the horrifying ordeal on camera, and the footage shows that Wilkerson was physically able to escape the vehicle.

In video taken by Simon Besner, a 
tourist from Canada, the woman can be seen outside the van as lifeguards
 try to pull her children from the vehicle.

Witnesses
 described her hopping out of the car window as her screaming children 
remained seat-belted in the back. Waves nearly pushed her 
under the van.

'It was a bit terrifying,' said Besner.

In the video, several men frantically 
try to get to the third and youngest child through the hatchback and the driver's 
side door as waves lap over the front of the minivan.

The small child is eventually pulled to safety.

Another tourist described watching with horror.

'My
 friend pointed out that there was a car getting really close to the 
beach and actually started driving on the water,' Taylor Quintin 
visiting the area from Vermont told Local 6.

'I saw a kid in the back waving his arms around screaming, 'Help us! Help us!' And the car kept going deeper.'

Frantic: Stacy Robinson, left, was the Good Samaritan who ran into the water and carried the two older children out of the surf after hearing their cries for help

'That's
 when I saw a guy from the beach run over next to the car and take out 
two small children and walk them back up. Another guy ran out and 
brought a little toddler out of the car'.

Many added that there was no way the incident was an accident.

Leonard
 R. Ross, an attorney representing Wilkerson's husband, Lutful Ronjon, 
released the following statement late Monday: 'My client continues to 
pray for his wife's wellbeing and sincerely hopes that mental health 
professionals will address her issues.'

Last week is was revealed that Wilkerson had been involved in a car crash that claimed a woman's life in 2007.

Jennifer
 Krane, had just given birth when she and husband Dough were slammed 
into by Ebony Wilkerson on a freeway near Fort Lauderdale.

On
 the day of the deadly wreck, Wilkerson was going northbound on Interstate 
95 when she switched lanes and slammed into the rear of a Nissan 
operated by Doug Krane, who was driving with his wife and infant son in the car.

The
 impact sent Krane's car skidding across the road and into a concrete 
barrier. Jennifer Krane suffered critical injuries in the collision and 
died several days later.

Wilkerson
 was cited for improper lane change, lost her license for a year and was
 ordered to serve 132 hours of community service, according to court 
records.
