England Women will step up World Cup preparations by taking on the United States and France in home friendlies early in the new year.

Manager Mark Sampson's side will face the US, who are ranked by FIFA as the world's number one side, on Friday, February 13.

They will then play France, fourth in the FIFA rankings and the second strongest team in Europe, on Thursday, April 9.

The fixtures are considered key stepping stones towards Canada 2015 by Sampson, who said: 'It's great news we can confirm the two matches against USA and France. For the team to improve we need to create as many opportunities as possible to test ourselves against the top-tier nations.

'In USA and France we are without doubt facing some of the best teams in the world, and teams who will have genuine ambitions of winning the World Cup.'

Wembley staged England Women's match against second-ranked Germany last month, when the visitors won 3-0 in front of a 45,000-strong crowd, and the Football Association has said venues for the upcoming friendlies will be announced in the coming weeks.

The defeat by Germany was watched by almost 50,000 fans at Wembley

England, ranked seventh by FIFA, will learn their World Cup opponents when the Canada 2015 draw takes place in Ottawa on Saturday.

Sampson added: 'The Germany match gave us a real marker in terms of where we need to strive to be in the long term. We have a long way to go to reach those levels but the experience of matches against the top players and top teams will allow us to develop the qualities we need to be competitive as we can be in the summer.'
