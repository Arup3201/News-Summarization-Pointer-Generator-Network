Former Ireland rugby star Keith Wood talks to Sportsmail about everything from his sporting heroes and career highlight to who would play him in a movie about his life.

Who is your sporting hero? 

Muhammad Ali. He was one of the first sportsmen I ever watched on television as a six-year-old in a big fight.

What would you be if you weren’t a sportsman?

If I was a kid today, I’d want to be an architect but I went into banking when I left school and worked as a banker until the game went professional.

Keith Wood said he would have liked to have been a golfer and greatly admired Seve Ballesteros

Which other sportsman would you like to be?

I am envious of so many sportsmen with all the skills they bring to bear — but I would have loved to be a good golfer. Seve Ballesteros in his magic gloves.

Career highlight?

The Lions in 1997 when we beat the Springboks 2-1.

... and the worst moment?

The European Cup final of 2000, when Munster lost to the Northampton Saints 9-8.

If your house was burning down, what one possession would you save?

My family.

What’s the best advice you’ve ever been given?

Never be ashamed of being proud of what you are good at.

The former British and Irish Lions captain said his sporting hero was former boxer Muhammad Ali

Favourite karaoke song?

Sunny Afternoon by The Kinks.

Three most-listened to songs on your ipod?

I have very catholic tastes — I listen to anything. It’s constant. Anything by Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen or Beck.

Last film you saw?

The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.

Last book you read?

Ed Smith’s What Sport Tells Us About Life. It was fantastic — absolutely incredible!

Which three people would you invite to dinner and why?

Spock because he is so logical, Muhammad Ali because he is a legend, and Nelson Mandela because he is an inspiration.

Wood admitted to being a huge Star Trek fan and said he would like to have dinner with Dr Spock

Favourite pre-match meal?

Chicken and pasta with a light mushroom sauce — how specific is that?

Can you cook? Best dish?

Yes I can. I will have a go at cooking anything but I do love a good Sunday roast. The meat has to be beef.

Your favourite holiday destination?

I love the west coast of County Clare where I am from. It is magic. For sun, I’m not really sure but I do love skiing, so Saint-Legier-La Chiesaz in Switzerland. I like travelling, I am incredibly organised and I have a routine.

In a film of your life, who would you like to play you?

Telly Savalas.

What’s the most expensive thing you’ve ever bought?

My house, obviously.

Tell us a secret...

I am a big Star Trek fan — I am a total Trekkie.
