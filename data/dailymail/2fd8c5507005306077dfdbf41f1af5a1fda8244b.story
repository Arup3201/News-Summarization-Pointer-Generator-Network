It’s a video to avoid watching if you are afraid of heights.

Released by urban freeclimber James Kingston, the 2.09-minute footage shows the daredevil scaling the South Bank Tower in London.

He scales the frame of the building, climbing to a point where he has to leap off on to another surface – without any safety equipment.

Leap of faith: James jumps from the crane to a platform in the vertigo-inducing video

At 500feet high, Kingston, who hit the headlines when a video of him performing a backflip on a bridge went viral, films from the top of the tower, taking off his jumper before beginning to climb down.

Just when you thought the vertigo-inducing video couldn’t get any worse, the footage switches to the climber hanging one handed from the structure.

According to Kingston, it’s all about getting in the right mindset – revealing today in an interview on This Morning that he takes 10 minutes to ‘get his head straight’.

Sitting alongside his mum Julie and joined Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield on the ITV1 show, he said: ‘To get control of the situation, mainly I’m telling myself I shouldn’t be scared, ‘cause it’s such a simple thing.’

He added: ‘Physically it’s nothing special. Mentally, it’s up here. It’s about 70 per cent mental, 30 per cent physical.’

However, Julie added: ‘It’s terrifying. Even the thought of it now, I get nervous taking about it.’

Kingston, who used to be afraid of heights, said Dubai’s Burj Khalifa on his list of must-climbs.

He added: ‘I’m not encouraging people to go out and hang of cranes. 

‘What I’m encouraging people to do is to go out and do what they love.’
