A legendary hacker who faced up to 26-years in prison avoided a prison sentence on Tuesday after he was hailed for his 'truly extraordinary' work over three years as an informant - during which time he essentially became an undercover FBI agent.

Authorities at the US District Court for the Southern District of New York said that Hector Xavier Monsegur, a onetime member of the cyber-activist hacking group Anonymous had helped to thwart at least 300 cyber attacks and helped in the arrest of eight other hackers since 2011.

Monsegur, 30, who under the name, Sabu, founded the offshoot LulzSec, shocked the hacking community by turning against them and in the courtroom on Tuesday, US District Judge Loretta Preska saluted his help as extraordinary.

During his career, Sabu is estimated by the US government to have participated in more than 250 cyber attacks - causing up to $50 million worth of damages.

'That personal characteristic of turning on a dime and doing good and not evil is the most important factor in this sentence,' said Preska.

But U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska imposed a term of seven months behind bars — equal to what he'd already served — which means Monsegur was a free man after his sentencing hearing in Manhattan federal court.

Condemnation from those who Monsegur had betrayed was swift and strong. A spokesperson for Anonymous told the Guardian that 'Monsegur is, first and foremost, a criminal; the FBI’s cyber crime task force are his co-conspirators. While operating under their supervision, Monsegur committed numerous felonies which should in no way be excused due to his protected informant status.'

Monsegur, wearing a black shirt, khaki pants and wire-rim glasses, nodded affirmatively while Preska described his assistance to the government.

'I assure you, I'm not the same person you saw three years ago,' Monsegur told the judge. 'I'm ready to move on.'

According to a government sentencing memo filed on Friday, Monsegur's actions 'prevented at least millions of dollars in loss to to these victims.'

'Monsegur's cooperation was complex and sophisticated, and the investigations in which he participated required close and precise coordination with law enforcement officers in several locations,' Manhattan Assistant U.S. Attorney James Pastore wrote in the memo according to USA Today.

Monsegur began hacking from his Manhattan apartment in the early 2000s and used his computer skills to steal credit card information - allegedly stealing and causing up to $50 million worth of damage.

In a 2011 interview with an online magazine, Monsegur said that he joined Anonymous because he was upset with the treatment and arrest of WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.

In early 2011, using his Sabu alias, Monsegur set up the Anonymous splinter group called Lulz Security, or LulzSec, which hacked the computers of Fox, Nintendo and PayPal.

When FBI agents showed up at Monsegur's home in the summer of 2011, he immediately agreed to cooperate.

According 
to a court filing by U.S. prosecutors, Monsegur, 30, and five other 
members of Anonymous formed LulzSec, which engaged in hacks on companies
 including Internet security firm HB Gary, News Corp's Fox Television, 
Tribune Co and Sony Corp, as well as the website for the U.S. Senate.

After the FBI approached him at his home in June 2011, Monsegur agreed to cooperate with law enforcement.

Monsegur
 secretly pleaded guilty to charges including computer hacking in August
 2011, a fact that did not become public until charges were announced 
against five other hackers connected with LulzSec in 2012.

Among those charged was Jeremy Hammond, a Chicago resident who at the time was the FBI's No.1 cyber criminal target.

Hammond,
 29, was sentenced in November to 10 years in prison after pleading 
guilty to cyber attacks on various government agencies and businesses.

US
 prosecutors said in the court filing that Monsegur's cooperation also 
led to the prosecution of Matthew Keys, a former deputy social media 
editor of Reuters.com.

Keys has pleaded not guilty to charges that he aided members of Anonymous.

Monsegur
 also engaged in a 'significant undercover operation' that exposed an 
unnamed subject's role in an existing investigation soliciting cyber 
attacks on a foreign government, prosecutors said. No charges have 
resulted in the case.

The
 roughly 300 computer hacks Monsegur helped prevent included targets 
such as the U.S. Armed Forces, the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, 
and NASA, prosecutors said.

He
 also provided information about vulnerabilities in critical 
infrastructure such as a city's water utility and a foreign energy 
company.

While
 U.S. authorities praised Monsegur's cooperation, they also said in the 
court filing that contrary to rumor, Monsegur was not involved in the 
prosecution of operators of Silk Road, an Internet black-market bazaar 
that accepted Bitcoin.
