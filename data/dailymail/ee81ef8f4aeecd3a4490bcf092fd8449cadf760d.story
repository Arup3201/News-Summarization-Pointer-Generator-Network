Twelve secondary school heads voiced their ‘disgust’ yesterday at strikes in support of a militant teacher battling to keep her job as a full-time union official.

As teachers walked out in defence of Julie Davies, the heads accused the National Union of Teachers of ‘making children pay’ for a personal dispute.

Mrs Davies, who is paid £45,900 a year, has not taught since 2000 when she became a full-time NUT rep. She has been suspended after heads accused her of ‘confrontation’ and encouraging ‘a climate of mistrust’.

They refused to continue to fund her union work but Mrs Davies is leading two-day strikes in protest, initially targeting Fortismere and Highgate Wood schools in north London.

In letter to the council leader signed by 11 colleagues, Dame Joan McVittie, head of Woodside High, accused the NUT of ‘retaliation against the children’.

She said: ‘The current strikes, and further proposed strikes, will cause great damage to the education of young people in both of these schools and I have no doubt that other schools will be affected.’

The letter added: ‘I am disgusted by the response of the NUT: instead of negotiating with the employer, it has chosen to strike in selected schools, thereby damaging the life chances of vulnerable young people in this authority.

‘It cannot be right that children should be made to pay for a dispute that is essentially between a union official and her employer, the local authority.’

Teachers at the two schools will walk out again with ballots planned at two more schools – Hornsey School for Girls and Parkview.

A petition calling on NUT general secretary Christine Blower to step in and end the strike had attracted nearly 200 signatures last night.

One mother-of-two in her 40s whose children are at Fortismere, said the strike had been ‘disruptive’.

‘I'm self-employed so it's been difficult to get on with my work with the children at home,’ she said.

'I worry that this may set a precedent for the future.

'Why does she think she can disrupt all the kids in their schooling just because she feels the rules don't apply to her?

'I don't see why the kids have to be dragged into this.

'It beggars belief and it's tantamount to blackmail. She's blackmailing the council.

'It's wrong and she's showing no sign of backing down. She seems determined she's going to win this no matter what - and at the expense of the children.

'I'm so frustrated about this, it really annoys me.’

Meanwhile a father in his 40s whose children attend Highgate Wood school said: 'We are just concerned about our children's education. They're being used for a political issue which is nothing to do with them.

'A single Union rep should not have the power to call strikes relating to their own personal issues.

'For the sake of our kids and our sanity please get on and resolve this now.'

Schools in Haringey currently pool their funds to pay Mrs Davies’ wages but many heads are unwilling to continue the arrangement.

Groups representing both primary and secondary heads have written to Haringey Council warning that they will refuse to continue contributing to the fund amid concerns over the conduct of the local NUT branch.

The letter from local secondary heads said: ‘Secondary school head teachers have found, and continue to find, that Ms Davies' preferred approach and working style is one of confrontation and obfuscation.

‘Our combined experience is that she seeks to encourage a climate of mistrust, often involving the airing of her personal critiques of individual head teachers, rather than seeking to develop effective communication channels or relationships based on trust and openness.’

Another letter, from a ‘significant number of primary head teachers’, stated: ‘It is our view that it is simply not feasible to do so whilst current union working practices exist.’

Mrs Davies was suspended in July over the concerns expressed by heads as well as other allegations, including that she sent a tweet spreading news about a Haringey mayor ‘abusing’ her position and also that she fired off a rude email to a councillor after food waste was not collected in her street.

The council’s investigation into the claims is ongoing.
