The body of Choi Chi-Man, 48, who died when an AirAsia flight crashed in the Java Sea on December 27 has been recovered

The body of a British man who died when an AirAsia flight crashed in the Java Sea in December has been found.

Choi Chi-Man, 48, was travelling with his two-year-old daughter Zoe on flight QZ8501 from Surabaya, Indonesia to Singapore when it disappeared on December 27 with 162 people on board. 

Mr Choi, a university of Essex graduate who has family in Hull, was managing director of an energy company in Indonesia.  

He purchased his plane ticket and that of his two-year-old daughter Zoe on Boxing Day - according to the passenger manifest - and they were seated in the first row, in seats 1B and 1C.

Mr Choi's wife, Mei-Yi Wee and son Luca, five, had caught an earlier fight to Singapore's Changi Airport.  

AirAsia flight QZ8501 departed Surabaya at 5.30am local time and was scheduled to land at Changi Airport at 8.30am local time.

However, it lost contact with air traffic control during the flight, just after the pilot  reportedly asked to deviate from the flight path due to bad weather.

The Airbus A320 was last seen on radar at 6:16am local time but vanished less than a minute later.

All 155 passengers and seven crew on board flight QZ8501 died. 

In 30 seconds, it rose from 32,000 feet to 37,400 feet. The flight then dipped to 32,000 feet, before descending for around three minutes after which the plane's black boxes stopped. 

Mr Choi and his two-year-old daughter Zoe were only on the flight as he could not get enough seats to fly with his wife and son - they were waiting at Singapore's Changi Airport for them to arrive

An investigation into the cause of the crash is still continuing.

Last month, in a statement to an Indonesian parliamentary committee, the country's transport minister Ignasius Jonan said the plane was believed to have stalled after climbing too fast to avoid a storm. 

At least 47 bodies have been recovered so far from the crash.  

In a statement the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: 'We can confirm the identification of the British victim of Air Asia flight QZ8501, Choi Chi-Man .

'Our thoughts are with his family and we continue to provide them with support at this difficult time.'
