Actor Samuel L. Jackson was at the eye of a storm of his own creation after he took to Twitter to claim it was 'unfair' that Hurricane Issac missed the Republican convention and hit the gulf coast of the U.S.

The 62-year-old star of The Avengers and Pulp Fiction waded into the politically charged atmosphere that surrounds the battering of the coast by the category 1 hurricane and specifically NOLA, or New Orleans.

'Unfair S**t: GOP spared by Issac! NOLA prolly F***ed Again! Not understanding God's plan!' wrote Jackson, seemingly agitated that seven-years on from the devastation of HUrricane Katrina, New Orleans and not the Republican National Convention in Tampa took the full brunt of Issac's force.

The response to Jackson's tweet was vitriolic, with conservative feather's well and truly ruffled by the outspoken and popular actor.

'I've had it with these motherf***ing racist Democrats on this motherf***ing Twitter.#killyourself' wrote @LastBrainLeft, invoking one of Jackson's most famous scenes from the film Snakes on a Plane.

Other's took their offence further, with REELTalk Radio Show host Audrey Russo attacking Jackson on Twitter, saying, 'Very few in my profession to respect these days. Jackson is a sick, twisted, hateful racist...'

However, support for Jackson's controversial point of view is forthcoming on Twitter, with 1,149 people re-tweeting his 'unfair' tweet that Issac, when it was a tropical storm, missed the Republican National Convention in Tampa on Monday.

The majority of comments aimed at Jackson though took exception to him apparently wishing ill-will on an entire city because of a political event being held there.

Half an hour later Jackson realised that he might have crossed a line after thousands complained about what he wrote.

Just one of the thousands of vitriolic tweets that Jackson received in response to his 'Unfair' tweet. This comment on Twitter mirrors Jackson's famous line in the film Snakes on a Plane

'Daayum! Poked a Hornets nest, hunh? Apologies to God, Tampa, da GOP& Isaac(sp)! Who played the Race card?!' wrote Jackson.

Despite his back-track, it seems that his repeated mentions of God and Tampa sparked more ire from Twitter users.

'Whoooo! A lotta s**t stirred into a Bulls**t tweet! Politics & Religion get MUHFREPUBLICANS heated!' remarked Jackson as he got creative with his favourite expletive.

The actor then tried to put the storm behind him by tweeting very uncontroversial advice: 'Seriously, leave the path of Danger if you're asked. Be safe & be Smart wherever you are & whatever your Politics!'

Samuel L. Jackson's support for President Obama is no secret, with the veteran Hollywood actor declaring in the March issue of Ebony magazine that he voted for Mr. Obama 'because he was black.'

'Cuz that's why other folks vote for other people - because they look like them,' said Jackson to the magazine.

And in October, Jackson expressed his view that the Tea Party was racist by saying, 'It's not politics. It is not economics. It all boils down pretty much to race. It is a shame,' said Jackson to New York Magazine.

Jackson's comments follow on from the actress Ellen Barkin, who said she hoped Republicans would be drowned by Hurricane Isaac.

The violent storm, which made landfall in Louisana on Tuesday night, was previously feared to be heading for the GOP convention in Tampa, Florida.

And sitcom star Ellen Barkin caused 
controversy when she appeared to endorse a tweet saying that the 
delegates should be swept 'right into the ocean'.

On
Monday afternoon, Ms Barkin retweeted a message sent to her by another 
user saying: 'C'mon #Isaac! Wash every pro-life, anti-education, 
anti-woman, xenophobic, gay-bashing, racist SOB right into the ocean! 
#RNC'

The first day of the Republican National Convention was cancelled due to the threat posed by Isaac, which has brought high winds and storms to the entire Gulf region.

Ms Barkin has also drawn opposition with a series of anti-Mormon messages, as well as joking about the death of conservative pundit Andrew Breitbart.
