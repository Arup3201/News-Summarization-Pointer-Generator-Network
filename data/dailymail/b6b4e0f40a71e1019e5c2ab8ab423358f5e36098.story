A teenager destined to spend life behind bars for stabbing to death her newborn 135 times after secretly giving birth in the laundry room of her Minnesota home is back on a trial for a second time.

Nicole Beecroft was just 17 when she was sentenced to life in prison for killing her baby girl - who she kept secret from her family - and throwing the towel-covered body in a trash can at the front of her Oakdale home in April 2007.

But last year the now 24-year-old's conviction and life sentence was overturned.

Her new trial began yesterday with explosive questions around whether the infant was already dead when she was knifed.

Second chance: Nicole Beecroft, now 24, is on trial for a second time over the alleged stabbing death of her newborn in 2007

Defense attorney Christine Funk told a Washington County judge the crucial issue in the second murder trial was whether the baby was born stillborn, as Beecroft has always maintained.

'The state wants you to
focus on why Nicole would stab the baby if she were already dead,' Funk said, according to Twin Cities.

'The issue is whether the state can 
prove beyond a reasonable doubt whether the defendant's actions caused 
the death of that infant.'

However prosecutors argue the baby was alive and never intended to keep the baby, going to great lengths to conceal the pregnancy.

'On her way downstairs, she 
grabbed a steak knife and two scissors,' Washington County prosecutor Siv 
Yurichuk said.

'She stabbed that baby 135 times.
Over and over and over, until the baby was so fraught with wounds she 
bled to death.'

Beecroft reportedly told her best friend about the killing, whose family then tipped off police.

Last year, Beecroft's life sentence without parole for first-degree premeditated murder was quashed by the Minnesota 
Supreme Court.

The court found Beecroft's rights of due process were violated because interfering prosecutors prevented the 
defense from calling expert witnesses.

Yurichuk said the medical examiner who performed the autopsy determined the full-term baby was born alive and died from her wounds.

'Why would somebody stab a baby that's already dead?' she said.

During the testimony of an Oakdale police officer, a recording was played of Beecroft's first police interview on April 10, 2007, before the infant's body had been found.

Beecroft told the interviewing officers she 'went into panic mode' when the baby wasn't breathing, and lay with the baby for some time waiting for her to cry.

She never mentioned the stabbing.

'What were you going to do if the baby was breathing?' one interviewer asked her.

'Bring her to the hospital,' Beecroft, who had never been in trouble with the law and worked two jobs, said.

She said her mother Kari Beecroft, now deceased, and her mother's boyfriend were home at the time,Â  but she didn't tell them what was going on, according to Twin Cities.

'How can you throw your child in the trash? Whether your mom approves or not ... this baby had a chance at living,' an interviewing officers asked.

Prosecutors said they will finish presenting their case next week.
