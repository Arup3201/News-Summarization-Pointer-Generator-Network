An adventurers club which celebrates men who have climbed some of the world's highest mountains and stood atop of the North Pole has upheld a ban on women becoming members.

The venerable LA institution 'The Adventurers' Club of Los Angeles' in California, has banned women from being among their ranks for nearly 100 years.

And on Thursday they  decided to uphold their 93-year-old tradition and remain a 'gentlemen's-only club.'

If the members opted to change the bylaws to admit women they would have required a two-thirds yes vote.  

Marc Weitz, the group's former president, said that Thursday's balloting fell short of that, although he couldn't say by how much. 

One of their bylaws also prohibits revealing anything about vote totals.

Weitz, who lobbied to let women in, says he's disappointed in the decision and might raise the issue again next year.

The club's members include men who have sailed around the world, run marathons on every continent and undertaken numerous other adventures.

The club itself displays artifacts and pieces of history collected by Club members from all over the globe, commemorating their international expeditions.

It describes itself as a private gentlemen’s club, tracing its roots back to Teddy Roosevelt and friends in a 1908 meeting.

The Club was founded by Captain Jack Roulac in 1921, and was incorporated in 1922. It is dedicated to world-wide adventure and traveling off the beaten path.

On its website, it says club members have met nearly every week to share their exotic tales of adventure. 

And members have 'traveled from the Oceans greatest depths to outer space and the many wondrous places between.'  

But they do not appear to think that their ban on women members is sexist. The club states that women who have done the same type of adventures as the men are occasionally allowed to attend as guests.
