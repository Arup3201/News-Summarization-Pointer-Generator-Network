She's  one of British's most cherished stars of screen and stage and has kept fans entertained for nearly 60 years.

But, as her latest interview proves, Dame Judi Dench still looks - and feels - young at heart.

Gracing the cover of Good Housekeeping magazine in a stylish powder blue coat, the 80-year-old discusses red carpet fashion, whether she’ll ever remarry and how she feels the temptation to get a tattoo.

Dame Judi Dench, 80, is Good Housekeeping magazine's March 2015 covergirl and chats tattoos, feeling edgy about retiring and whether she will ever remarry

Dame Dench made her professional acting debut in 1957 with the Old Vic Company.

Fast forward nearly 60 years and she has added ten BAFTAs, six Olivier Awards, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, two Golden Globes, an Academy Award, and a Tony Award to her awards cabinet. 

She's also become a poster girl for the mature female actress and her red carpet choices are respected worldwide (even if she admits she 'loathes' getting ready and is always 'terribly nervous' in clothes 'you have to live up to').

Despite her success and worldwide acclaim, you'd be wrong for thinking that the grand dame of acting, whose roles have included A Room with a View, Shakespeare in Love and Chocolat, will consider retiring anytime soon though. 

In the interview, she discusses cosmetic work and while she admits she'd love to go into surgery right now and come back with completely smooth skin, she's far too squeamish

In October, she began filming as Cecily, Duchess of York to Benedict Cumberbatch's Richard III in the second series of The Hollow Crown. 

'The thought of putting my feet up doesn’t appeal at all – no no, no!,' she said.

'I’ve got plenty of time for that at weekends or on odd days off. The prospect of no work on the horizon makes me a bit edgy. I have no particular ambitions – I just want to be employed!'

Feisty and independent as ever, Dame Judi recently insisted she is driven mad by people constantly asking if she's ready to slow down - and turning 80 in December was no different. 

'All I wanted was the people I love around me, I didn’t want a fuss. The words old, eight-oh and retire are banned in my house,' she said of the milestone celebration.  

The fun-loving Bond actress admits that she was even tempted to get a tattoo to mark her 80th birthday

Keen to prove her point, the fun-loving Bond actress admits that she was even tempted to get an inking to mark the occasion.

She said: 'I am tempted to have a tattoo to mark my birthday. Finty’s [her daughter] very keen on me having one. There’s an Indian symbol that I like which supposedly represents life and love and everything. 

'One of the cameramen who worked on The Second Best Exotic Marigold Hotel told me what it meant, but I’m a bit nervous in case I’m being set up… It might be unbelievably rude!' 

As well as tattoos, she also discusses cosmetic work and while she admits she'd love to go into surgery right now and come back with completely smooth skin, she's far too squeamish. 

She said: 'I don’t think I’m vain enough. It’s not that I don’t mind the lines, because I do, but just not enough to do anything. My agent would go barmy. I’d do myself out of the parts for old people.' 

Dame Judi may have become a poster girl for the mature female actress but she admits she 'loathes' getting ready for the red carpet

Judi, who was heartbroken after losing partner Michael Williams to cancer in 2001 following 30 years of marriage, also speaks candidly about finding love again with conservationist David Mills. 

She said: 'For 30 years, I was divinely happy with Michael. I love the company of being in a relationship - I’m no good on my own. 

'It’s lovely to have someone to laugh with again: David has a heavenly sense of humour. 

'He laughs at exactly the same things as I do. 

'Humour is the most important thing. If someone can make you laugh, even in the middle of the most terrible time, it’s wonderful.'

Discussing the prospect of remarrying, she added: 'Marriage isn’t something I’ve thought about. 

'David has his house, I have mine a few miles away, and that suits us. 

'He’s from a different world from me and it makes for a great balance. I’m jolly lucky.'
