Following on from his glory days on the racecourse, Frankel the super horse has been kicking back and enjoying retirement on the back of a 14-race unbeaten career. 

But his stamina will be tested once again on Valentine's Day when he has his first encounter with a mare. 

The breeding season runs from February 14 to July 14 and breeders from around the world are queuing up to pay the £125,000 fee.

Champion: Tom Queally winning at Newbury Racecourse riding Frankel who has been dubbed the best racehorse in the world

What are you looking at? Frankel gets adjusted to life as a stud

Even though the stallion's libido has not been tested, he is expected to 'cover' up to three mares a day at his home in Banstead Manor Stud in Newmarket. 

Mares will be brought to nearby stables where they will be monitored and presented when they are most likely to conceive.

Before the encounter they will also be teased by pony stallions and checked they are ready for mating to avoid  Frankel being snubbed by a mare who is not in the mood. 

Mares which have already been booked include German mare Danedream, winner of the 2011 Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, the Japanese champion Vodka, and Oatsee, the former racehorse bred in America which is considered among the world's finest broodmares. And he is booked for the next three years.

Nicknamed 'Usain Colt', the five-year-old thoroughbred was cheered on by a 32,000 sell-out crowd when he stormed to victory at Ascot in his final outing last year earning him the crown of best racehorse in the world.

He has been enjoying retirement in stud at Newmarket and is expected to earn around £200million for his owner Prince KhalidAbdullah, a member of the Saudi Arabian ruling family. The equine superstar was trained by Sir Henry Cecil.

But to get him ready for life as a stud stallion, Frankel is now enjoying gentle walks instead of energetic gallops.

It is also hoped his stablemates will make Frankel feel at ease. 

Lord Grimthorpe, Prince Khalid's racing manager, told The Sunday Telegraph: 'The demand is huge because Frankel is a worldwide phenomenon. But not just any mare can come and see him. 

'The horses will undoubtedly communicate. 'The other stallions will have told him, 'It isn't a bad life, mate'.
