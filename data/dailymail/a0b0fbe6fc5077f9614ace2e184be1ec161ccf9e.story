The BBC today apologised after a weather bulletin warned festival-goers heading to Glastonbury to 'prepare for rape'.

The blunder appeared in a subtitle on a forecast broadcast live on BBC One after the 10pm news.

Stunned viewers were warned to 'prepare for rape' rather than to 'prepare for rain' as experts predicted stormy weather would hit the UK this week.

Blunder: Viewers were quick to photograph the subtitle blunder after BBC News At Ten when they were told to expect 'rape' at Glastonbury festival, which kicks off this weekend, rather than 'rain' as predicted

After spotting they had typed the word 'rape' instead of 'rain' subtitle writers quickly corrected the message.

They wrote: 'As we head into Thursday, people going to Glastonbury will want to prepare for rape because this rain is heading - prepare for rain because this rain is heading right for you.'

But spectators were quick to take photographs of the blunder and post it on social media website Instagram.

One viewer said: 'I was shocked when 
the word ‘rape’ popped up on my screen during the weather forecast as 
I’d just turned the sound down.

'I wondered what on earth was going on until they started typing about rain. It was a very unfortunate mistake to make.'

The gates at Glastonbury Festival open today with music starting on Friday.

Anxious: Thousands of Glastonbury ticket-holders were tuning in to catch the forecast ahead of the festival

Embarrassing: The BBC marks the Chinese New Year by welcoming viewers into the 'year of the whores' during a bulletin in January. The channel later insisted the error was acknowledged and quickly corrected - to 'horse'

Error: A reporter's comment that 'pigs nibble anything, even wellies' takes on a different meaning when the last word is substituted for 'willies'. The mistake in 2011 later fuelled a Mock the Week subtitles gaffes segment

Mistake: Another blunder sees a court reporter quoted as saying: 'And the cat's pornography reading was low'

On January 31, viewers watching a bulletin about Chinese New Year were welcomed into 'the year of the whores' - rather than 'horse'.

More recently, a reporter's comment that pig nibble on 'wellies' was translated to 'willies' - to the amusement of hundreds of Twitter users and comedians.

And on Match Of The Day, the subtitle writers had a hard time getting to grips with the spelling of Adnan Junazaj, opting instead for 'Janet jazz jazz jam'.

Canadian indie rock band Arcade Fire headline the Pyramid Stage on Friday night before heavy metal band Metallica play on the same stage on Saturday.

British rock band Kasabian will close the festival on Sunday night.

Around 175,000 music fans will attend the festival which takes place near Pilton, Somerset, all as per tradition, most have been nervously waiting for weather forecasts to tell them what to expect.

A
 BBC spokeswoman said: 'We try to ensure our subtitling is as accurate 
as possible but there are occasions when mistakes inevitably occur.

'On this occasion the result was this unfortunate typo which was corrected as soon as possible.'

Hilarious subtitle blunders have aired on the BBC over the years - leaving both staff and viewers lost for words.

They are among many mistakes to have prompted a crackdown on the quality of subtitles, with a report set to be published by Ofcom this spring.

One gaffe sees the broadcaster mark the Chinese New Year by welcoming viewers into the 'year of the whores'.

The subtitling error, which happened during a bulletin at around 7pm on January 31, saw BBC News declare: ‘Welcome to the year of the whores. People around the globe celebrate.’

However, the channel later insisted that the error was acknowledged and quickly corrected - to the 'year of the horse’.

Lost in translation: Last Sunday, the BBC struggled to get to grips with the name of footballer Adnan Junazaj - misspelling his name as 'Janet jazz, jazz jam'. However, it correctly spelled the names of other players

Shocking: A man sees his son Fraser's name changed to 'phrase whore' in one particularly toe-curling blunder

Another 
blunder sees a reporter's comment that 'pigs nibble anything, even 
wellies' take on a completely different meaning when the last word is 
substituted for 'willies'.

The
 mistake, which happened during a news report in 2011, soon went viral 
on Twitter - and even fuelled a Mock the Week subtitles gaffes segment.

And during a football match, the BBC 
struggled to get to grips with the name of 18-year-old winger, Adnan 
Junazaj, who broke into the Manchester United team last season.

The broadcaster correctly spelled the names of other United players Javier Hernandez, Robin van Persie, Wayne Rooney and Juan Mata - before stumbling over the youngster's name.

Its hilarious attempts at janet, jazz, jazz and jam left those watching the programme with subtitles scratching their heads as they tried to work out what was actually being said.

And it isn't the first time the BBC has misspelled a name to amusing effect.

The broadcaster has previously referred to Italian prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi as 'Mr Beryl Beryl' - while Labour leader Ed Miliband became 'Ed Miller Band'.
