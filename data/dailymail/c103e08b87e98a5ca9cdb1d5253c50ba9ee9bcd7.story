Roy Keane rolled back the years by showing his Aston Villa players how it's done in training.

The Manchester United legend is Paul Lambert's assistant manager at Villa Park, and showed he's still got it by mixing it with the first team on the midlanders' pre-season tour of the USA.

Keane - who is also assistant manager to Republic of Ireland boss Martin O'Neill - showed off his skills in the middle of the park before signing autographs for fans.

Andreas Weimann and Charles N'Zogbia both netted in Villa's first win of the tour against Dallas on Wednesday. Next up for Lambert's side is a clash against Houston Dynamo on Saturday.

Meanwhile, Villa midfielder Fabian Delph has revealed he wants to sign a new deal with the club.

He said: 'I feel like I went missing for a few years and that's not something I'm happy with.

'The
 owner (Randy Lerner) has been brilliant. He's always believed in me and
 every time I've seen him he's been nothing but positive.

'I'd love to sign a new deal and am ready to talk but it's not up to me so we'll have to see.'
