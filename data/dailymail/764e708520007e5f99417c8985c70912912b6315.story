A teacher is accused of having a six-month sexual relationship with a 14-year-old student which started through the smart phone game Words with Friends, text messages and Facebook chats.

Granada High School math teacher Marie Johnson, 40, from Livermore, California, was arrested and booked on 24 counts of sexual assault charges on Wednesday.

Authorities believe the relationship started in December 2010 until May 2011, with most incidents taking place in the 40-year-old's car.

The boy is said to be a former student of Johnson's, who has been a math teacher for 13 years.

Investigators served a search warrant at Johnson's home and arrested her without incident, police said.

She is expected to be charged with unlawful sexual intercourse with a person under 18, oral copulation and committing a lewd act on a child.

According to the San Francisco 
Chronicle, the relationship between Johnson and the boy started through 
text messages, Facebook and instant messaging through the smart phone 
game, Words with Friends.

Police are advising parents to talk to their children about the episode.

Police officer Steve Goard said: 'We don't think that there are other victims, but we're not ruling that out, being that she's a teacher and has had access to kids throughout the years.'

Livermore Valley Joint Unified School District Superintendent Kelly Bowers said Johnson was placed on administrative leave and that the district could not comment about its history with the teacher, but said: 'As always, while following due process guidelines, if we discover that any adult or staff member has placed a student at risk, we take appropriate, swift and decisive action.

'Safety of our students is our top priority.'

Johnson is being held at Santa Rita Jail in Dublin on $1.85 million bail.
