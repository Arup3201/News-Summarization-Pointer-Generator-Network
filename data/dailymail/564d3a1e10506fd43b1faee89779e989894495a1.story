Actress Uma Thurman's yoga-teacher brother has been accused of using his classes at a hip New York yoga school to woo students into bed with him.

The claim was made by Columbia media law adjunct professor Maria Sliwa, who posted on yoga forum Yoganonymous about Dechen Thurman, 41.

Sliwa, a former NYPD officer, journalist, and younger sister of Guardian Angels founder, activist and radio host Curtis Sliwa, branded Thurman a 'sex addict' for his alleged sexcapades with students at Jivamukti in lower Manhattan.

'Sex addict': Maria Sliwa has accused Dechen Thurman of sleeping with his students at Jivamukti yoga studio in Manhattan

MailOnline's attempts to reach Dechen Thurman through Jivamukti were not successful. The studio's front desk person also declined to comment on the allegations, saying the subject made her 'feel uncomfortable' before hanging up.

Sliwa wrote that as a friend and former legal adviser to Thurman, she was privy to information that she could not in good conscience keep to herself.

Confidant: Maria Sliwa says she felt obligated to go public with her accusations for the safety of both Thurman and his students

'Plenty of women there [at Jivamukti] express plenty of feelings, and sometimes I do reciprocate as is my right as an individual to do so. Sometimes there are as many as five or six women in the class who I have slept with,' Dechen Thurman allegedly told Sliwa in a private message.

Sliwa said that she witnessed Thurman's bouts of crying, violent mood swings, threats of suicide and confessions of sex addiction before she felt obligated to report his behavior to Juivamukti management in a 41-page exposé.

The yoga studio's code of conduct clearly states that sexual relationships between teachers and students are unacceptable. 

'All forms of sexual behavior or 
harassment with students are unethical, even when a student invites or 
consents to such behavior involvement,' reads the Jivamukti Code of 
Professional Standards.

Sliwa
 writes that she was forced to go public with her claims after repeated 
assurances by the Jivamukti management that they would seek help for 
Thurman went unfulfilled.

'When
 I met with Jivamukti, I submitted volumes of evidence. I also offered 
to take a polygraph exam, and was told that it was not necessary and 
that the school believed everything I had submitted as true,' she wrote 
in a Facebook post addressing the Yoganonymous post.

'When
 the school promised me many things, but did not follow through, I had 
no other recourse than to take this to a public forum. I do not believe 
that his present situation at Jivamukti is safe for himself as well as 
for others.'

Yoga lover: Thurman allegedly told Sliwa that he would often have classes in which five or six of the students were women he has slept with

A spokesman for Jivamukti told Yoganonymous staff are investigating Sliwa's claims.

'These are very serious allegations which the school takes very seriously and can lead to the teacher [sic] termination.…Please reassure [sic] that we will handle it with the outmost care and seriousness,' Carlos Menjivarthe Managing Director of the Jivamukti Yoga School said.

Jivamukti was co-founded by Sharon Gannon and David Life and has a slew of high profile supporters including Madonna, Donna Karan, Sting, Sarah Jessica Parker and Christy Turlington.

Emotional issues: Sliwa alleges that Thurman had violent mood swings, fits of crying and had threatened to commit suicide

'I was a close friend of Dechen and he told me he suffers from sex addiction. He is a good teacher but he has problems with women and his technique is unfortunately very hands-on. It is unsafe for the students. He needs therapy,' Sliwa told Page Six, calling him a 'yoga gigolo.'

'Yoga class is not a pick-up place for predators.'

In a feat of timing, his sister actress Uma Thurman's latest film, Lars Von Trier's Nymphomaniac, is set for release in March.

Following publication of this article, the original accusation was removed from Yoganonymous.
