Sweeping cloud formations and downpours at a height of 12,000m, spiraling B747 contrails and snow-tipped mountain ranges - these are some of the incredible scenes photographed from a pilot's cockpit.

Spanish pilot Jordi Martin Garcia has produced a series of stunning photos of the world below as he sees it from the seat of his aircraft.

The 42-year-old, who flies for a Spanish airline, has amassed the collection of images over the past 15 years as
 he has flown routes across Europe.

Jordi Martin Garcia took this photograph of contrails streaming behind a B747 above the south of France during a stunning orange sunset

Among them are shots of the peaks of 
industrial buildings breaking through low-lying cloud, acres of 
multi-coloured tulips fields in the Netherlands and the Paris skyline.

He told MailOnline he started out using the pictures a teaching device for his classes on Meterology at a pilots' academy and university.

They were also used in a book about aviation and meteorology he co-authored with TV and radio meteorologist Francesc Mauri, titled El tiempo visto desde el cielo (Weather From Above), which has not yet been been published in English.

He said: 'Itâ€™s complicated for me to speak about my favourite views for it is something that depends on many aspects.

'For instance - the time of the year and the day hour. Some landscapes have no rival in winter and others get their highest point of splendour in summer. We are lucky to live in a changing planet that is a constant surprise to us.

'On the other hand, the meteorological subject is an ever-present theme in my pictures. I still love to take pictures of the storm formations, foggy days, orographic clouds etcetera.'

Mr Garcia took this photograph of an 'alpine sunset' during a flight from Paris to Florence. He has used many of the images to illustrate a book on meteorology and aviation

Orographic clouds, shaped by the earth topography below, are some of the most picturesque seen and take unusual shapes, often appearing as a round disk hovering above mountain peaks.

Some of the more unusual photographs he has taken are those of the phenomenom called Brocken spectre - in which a giant magnified shadow, sometimes of the aircraft itself, is cast upon the upper surfaces of clouds.

With so many amazing images taken, Mr Martin Garcia understandably struggles to identify his favourite photo.

'There are different themes to consider around that question. Talking about meteorological phenomena, for instance, I like the picture of a heavy shower seen from above, or the Brocken spectre one.

'If we speak about landscape images, I like the ones of Paris, Mallorca or the tulip fields in Holland.'

He is also quick to remind viewers his number one priority is flying the aircraft - he only takes pictures in low workload situations, such as when the plane is on cruise control, or when he is seated in the observer seat of an Airbus A320.
