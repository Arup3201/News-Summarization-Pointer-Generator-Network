To kick off festival season in style, Men’s Health challenged three of the UK’s busiest hip-hop musicians to get into peak condition in just four weeks.

This year’s Men’s Health Celebrity Six-Pack challengers are Rudimental’s DJ Locksmith, Tinchy Stryder and Lethal Bizzle, who all took on the challenge amidst a month of hectic tours.

The amazing transformation of the challengers, unveiled in the Men’s Health August issue, aims to prove that getting into cover model shape doesn’t mean spending all day in the gym - and the magazine wants its readers to know that if they can do it while touring the UK, anyone can.

Transformation: This year's Men's Health Celebrity Six-Pack challengers are Rudimental's DJ Locksmith, Lethal Bizzle and Tinchy Stryder, who all took on the challenge amidst a month of hectic tours

Rudimental’s DJ Locksmith embarked on a US tour just as he signed up for the Men’s Health challenge.

He
 said: 'I’m no angel. A tour is a tour. The challenge was finding the 
discipline to train hard and eat well…and stick to clear spirits after 
the shows. During the 10-day tour, I think I got drunk twice.'

Life as a semi-pro footballer and a new father just as the band made it big meant Locksmith was no stranger to discipline.

This
 mindset helped him cut an impressive 5 per cent body fat. 'My aim was 
to lose fat, bring out my abs and see those lines again,' he said.

Bulking up: Hip hop stars, including Tinchy Stryder, embarked on Men's Health Celebrity Six-Pack challenge, which saw Tinchy add 2kg of muscle and carve out defined abs

Fed up with being titchy, Tinchy Stryder was determined to add 4 inches to his arms. As he admitted to Men’s Health: 'I’m a small guy so knew I’d have to work hard for decent results.'

A plan designed to build bulk helped Tinchy add 2kg of muscle and carve out defined abs. 'I wanted to add strength and a bit of muscle - and of course get a six pack.'

Lethal Bizzle’s motivation for the challenge was the chance to adopt a whole new mind-set.

He said: 'I work out a lot - that’s never been a problem. But eating properly is hard for me. I knew this challenge would give me the discipline I wanted.'

Mass gain: Lethal Bizzle's motivation for the challenge was the chance to adopt a whole new mind-set, which saw him lose 4 inches from his waist and drop 7kg

Experimenting with calorie cycling, fasted cardio and Hugh Jackman’s 16:8 diet - which involves doing all your eating for the day during an eight-hour window and then not eating at all for 16 hours, water permitted - helped Bizzle lose 4 inches from his waist and drop 7kg.

Speaking about the results, Men’s Health Editor Toby Wiseman said: 'Four weeks which might not seem long to get into shape but each one of our musicians has achieved incredible physical results by combining Men’s Health science with hip-hop attitude.

'We’re sure that their fans will be able to see the results when they play live this summer.'
