It is a prank that goes against all conventional wisdom for kitchen safety.

In a video posted to YouTube, a man tells the camera: 'Danny lost a bet so he's got to stick a knife in the toaster'.

The footage unfolds with Danny holding a knife and looking quite hesitant about his task.

The introduction to the video says that Danny, wearing a grey hoodie, lost a bet and must stick a knife in the toaster

In a flash, the blast from the toaster sent the group flying back from the worktop

Egged on by his friends, he appears to take deep breaths before stopping himself from doing it.

At one point another pal tells him: 'The handle's plastic on that one, you're not going to feel anything', to try to convince him to go ahead.

Amid plenty of swear words, the group try counting to three to get the dare going.

Danny even gestures to the camera, asking: 'Why is he filming because obviously something's going to go wrong'.

After three attempts at a countdown and a few more expletives, Danny sticks the knife in.

In a flash of white light, the group appear to be thrown back by the force of the blast.

But commenters on YouTube questioned whether the explosion was real or staged.

Danny is seen and heard being egged on by his friends to carry out the dare

Some claimed the video was edited so the sound didn't match the blast, while others said the knife did not touch the toaster.

But
 another backed up the makers of the video, writing: 'The initial 
contact with the knife and the toaster creates a flash of light before a
 process called thermal conduction takes place.

'This is why it seems like the knife never touched the toaster.'

Whether the toaster was plugged in or not, sticking the knife in is certainly not something to try at home.

It took a few attempts at psyching himself up before Danny finally took the plunge

The mangled remains of the toaster are seen on the worktop with little else looking damaged
