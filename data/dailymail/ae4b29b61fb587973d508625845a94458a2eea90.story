The estranged husband of a Texas woman charged with sending ricin-laced letters to President Barack Obama and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has won temporary custody of the couple's newborn son.

The Texarkana Gazette reports a judge in New Boston on Monday granted temporary custody to Nathaniel Richardson.

He's divorcing Shannon Guess Richardson, 35, who remains in federal custody. She pleaded not guilty Wednesday at a hearing where a federal judged ruled her competent to stand trial in the ricin letter case, KSLA reported.

The incarcerated woman gave birth July 4 to a premature son. She wasn't present at the custody hearing.

An
affidavit says Shannon Richardson tried to implicate her husband in the
ricin letters before her June 7 arrest. He has not been charged.

Shannon
Richardson has been accused of sending tainted letters to Obama, 
Bloomberg and to a leader of the mayor's gun-control group.

Texarkana, Texas, attorney John Delk told the Texarkana Gazette that the baby weighed less than two pounds when it was born.

Richardson was pregnant with her son when she allegedly manufactured the deadly poison in May and mailed letters with anti-gun control rhetoric to Obama, Bloomberg, and the gun control lobbying group that Bloomberg founded.

Richardson allegedly tried to blame the poisoned letters on her husband Nathaniel Richardson, who the FBI believes is innocent

Federal authorities say she tried to frame her husband, a U.S. Army veteran who is the father of her unborn child.

Richardson, an aspiring actress, already has five children from previous relationships, age 4 to 19.

The poison-laced letters said: 'You will have to kill me and my family before you get my guns.'

And, 'Anyone who wants to come to my house will get shot in the face. The right to bear arms is my constitutional, God-given right and I will exercise that right till the day I die.

'What’s in this letter is nothing compared to what I’ve got planned for you.'

Richardson is an aspiring actress who has had minor roles on television shows such as The Walking Dead and the Vampire Diaries.

Her husband Mr Richardson has said she was desperate to become famous.
