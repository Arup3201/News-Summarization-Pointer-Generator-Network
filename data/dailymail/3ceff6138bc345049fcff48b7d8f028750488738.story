Police forces across Britain were on alert last night after a warning of an Islamic State-style plot to kidnap and behead an officer.

More than 7,000 officers in the West Midlands were warned they were in imminent danger following a telephone threat.

Police chiefs in Britain’s second largest force were so concerned at the ‘anonymous but credible’ threat that they stopped officers going off duty until they had attended a security briefing.

However, it was reported that senior officers feared a female officer would be targeted for 'shock factor'.

A source told the Daily Mirror: 'It is known police are worried jihadists are going to behead an officer.

'They believe they want to target a WPC for shock factor. The fear is a terror cell will think female officers make easier targets.' 

Other forces urgently reviewed safety precautions and warned officers not to wear their uniform or ID badge when off duty – normally they are allowed to wear uniform when travelling to and from work.

The alert came after Islamic State called on followers to launch ‘lone wolf’ attacks on the West.

The official threat level to officers was already heightened amid fears extremists will attempt to copy last year’s murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby – which, as the Mail reported last week, has led to soldiers being warned not to wear their uniform off duty.

One concern is that a woman police officer or a civilian PCSO could be targeted. PCSOs do not carry a baton or other personal protection equipment,

Last night a 31-year-old man was arrested by counter-terrorism police investigating the threats against West Midlands Police.

Assistant Chief Constable Garry Forsyth said: ‘We have received information relating to the safety of West Midlands Police officers and police staff.

'There is nothing at this time to suggest there is an increased risk to members of the public. We have taken the opportunity to remind all employees of the need to be vigilant.’

Mr Forsyth insisted officers remain on patrol in the same numbers, adding: ‘We’ve taken appropriate measures to ensure our staff have the information they need to continue to provide the business they do, day-in and day-out.’

Metropolitan Police chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said he is considering strengthening his force’s security measures.

‘We’ve advised our staff to take reasonable precautions. We don’t tend to advertise what those are. We do not want to overreact,’ he added. Asked if police officers were in danger as never before, he replied that police were also a target during the decades of the Troubles in Northern Ireland.

The security services are increasingly concerned at the number of plots aimed at the police, military or Government. They have already uncovered evidence in at least three alleged conspiracies that frontline police officers and soldiers were in grave danger. They have also recovered evidence of suspected extremists monitoring a Territorial Army base and buying knives and Islamic State flags.

The threat to West Midlands Police was apparently passed on in a telephone call on Monday evening. The national security level remains at severe, signifying a terrorist attack is highly likely.

In October, the threat level to police officers was raised, following an Islamic State video telling followers to take retribution against countries leading the bombing campaign in northern Iraq and Syria.

Dr Charlotte Heath-Kelly, an expert in counter-terrorism from Warwick University, said: ‘Attacking a single police officer or member of the forces is much easier than say, bombing a shopping centre. There is much less planning... and less chance of being caught by the security services.’

The Home Office declined to comment, describing the threat as ‘purely an operational matter for the police’.
