Under scrutiny: A company founded by Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps is to be investigated by the advertising standards watchdog

A company founded by Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps is to be investigated by the advertising standards watchdog after the politician posed as a multi-millionaire under a false name to sell its services.

The firm, set up by Mr Shapps before he became an MP but when he was standing as a candidate for the Tories at a general election, is alleged to have used the alias of ‘Michael Green’ as its front man.

Mr Shapps attended conferences bearing the name tag Michael Green.

The Advertising Standards Authority has now launched an investigation into HowToCorp.com over allegations that the public had been misled by the alleged use of an alias.

Mr Shapps - who was recently promoted to the Cabinet in a reshuffle - has always maintained that he used a different name to keep his business and political interests separate.

He is expected to open the Conservatives’ conference in Birmingham this weekend.

The business has come under scrutiny since pictures emerged of Shapps attending a $3,000-a-head conference in a Las Vegas hotel showing him wearing a nametag with the name 'Michael Green'.

Mr Shapps passed the company on to his wife Belinda in 2008 and has not had any involvement with it since.

The firm also used the name of a businessman Sebastian Fox to promote its services.

The Advertising Standards Authority 
will look at whether the self-help firm’s promotion of the two 
businessmen and their fortunes to advertise the self-help services were 
misleading.

In
2007, the firm reportedly advertised its software for $200, telling 
customers that they could make $20,000 in 20 days or they would get 
their money back.

The firm is now branded as ‘Sebastian Fox’s HowToCorp’.

The
ASA said it wants to determine if both Michael Green and Sebastian Fox 
are ‘genuine businessmen and real people’, according to the Independent 
newspaper.

Punishment for breaching the advertising code includes being forced to remove paid-for advertising and a potential referral to the Office of Fair Trading for legal proceedings.

Mr Shapps told a local journalist in his Welwyn Garden City constituency yesterday that the complaint received by the ASA was ‘spurious’.

The ASA said: ‘We will investigate because we wish to establish whether there is a problem.'

A spokeswoman for Mr Shapps said: ‘Grant Shapps derives no income, dividends, or other income from this business, which is run by his wife Belinda with a registered office in Pinner in north-west London.

'He is quite simply not involved in this business.

‘Mrs Shapps runs her own online business, uses freelancers, moderators and programmers to post on forums, generate products and maintain a help desk.'
