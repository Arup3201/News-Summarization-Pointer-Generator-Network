Charged: Jasmine Tridevil, real name Alisha Hessler, was pulled over at 3.45 on Monday in Tampa, Florida

Lies: The 21-year-old became a viral sensation last year after claiming she paid $20,000 to have a third breast added. She suggested that TV stations run a reality show about her hardships as a three-breasted woman

Tests at the scene at 3.45am showed Hessler's blood alcohol content to be .180 - more than twice Florida's legal drinking limit.

Hessler made headlines in September 2014 after claiming she had paid $20,000 to surgically attach a third breast.

She claimed that she was was rejected by more than 50 doctors who feared violating ethical codes before she found a willing surgeon who would perform the procedure.

U.S. surgeons are barred from carrying out any operations that could be harmful to 'human dignity' under ethical codes outlined by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.

But just days later, as she attempted to land a reality show about her life as a three-breasted woman, her story was foiled.

Having lost a suitcase at Tampa International Airport, she filed a report claiming the value of the contents to be worth $5,000.

The report, which soon went viral, said the bag contained: 'misc female clothing, three pairs of stiletto heels, misc paperwork with owner's name, hair brush and a 3 breast prosthesis.'

The revelation confirmed surgeons' suspicions reported by DailyMail.com.

Scot Glasberg, president-elected of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons said: 'This would violate every ethical principle not just in surgery but in medicine as well.' 

Weeks later, a teenager interviewed byThe Sun newspaper alleged that he went on a first date with Tridevil durign which he was tied up, tortured, forced to sleep in a dog's cage and made to wear a dog's collar at her home in Tampa.

He told the paper: 'She is completely psychotic. She turned me into a slave, beat me and humiliated me.

'I am physically scarred for life and live with the shame of what she did to me.

'On the night we met she tied me up and flogged me against a post. She then got me really drunk and said she wanted to cut me.' 

Hessler's arrest comes as she attempts to launch a career as a performer, having recorded a highly sexualized music video called Born To Serve, which she shared online.
