This spirited television anchorman's early-morning dance moves are bound to keep traffic jamming, no matter how quiet the roads are.

Bob Herzog has been entertaining viewers with an energetic musical performance during his popular traffic roundup on WKRC's Good Morning Cincinnati every week for the past year.

Each Friday, the snake-hipped presenter shimmies into shot performing a well-known song, shoe-horning useful traffic information in place of original lyrics.

And he is well-versed in a range of different styles, from electronic pop, rock and roll and country music to rap, samba and disco.
