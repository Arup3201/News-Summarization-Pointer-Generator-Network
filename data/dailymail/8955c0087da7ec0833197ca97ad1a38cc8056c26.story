Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky drew up a new will nine days before his death, but not one of the five potential executors have been willing to take up the job of administering his estate.

A firm of accountants has been appointed by the court to act as receivers, although it is believed it could take them months or even years to work their way through the chaotic estate.

The 67-year-old was buried in a Surrey cemetery today surrounded by his two ex-wives and several mistresses.

Boris Berezovsky's funeral was held today at Brookwood Cemetery, in Woking, Surrey

Mr Berezovsky drew up a new will nine days before his death in March, but not one of the five potential executors have been willing to take on the job

The 67-year-old (pictured outside the High Court in August last year) was found lying on the floor of his bathroom at his home in Ascot, Berkshire, on March 23

Mr Berezovsky was once a leading 
Kremlin powerbroker but later fled into exile as a sworn enemy of 
strongman president Vladimir Putin.

A bodyguard discovered him dead in the bathroom of ex-wife Galina's home near Ascot on March 23. A post-mortem found his death was consistent with hanging but a police investigation remains underway.

Russia has denied its secret services
 targeted Berezovsky but Putin said last that he could not 'rule out' 
Western intelligence playing a role, though he said he had no such 
evidence.

The private ceremony was at Brookwood
 Cemetery, the largest in Britain. Its timing changed several times to 
avoid interest from the Russian media.

Reports in Moscow said ex-wives Nina Korotkova and Galina Besharova were present plus long-time partner Yelena Gorbunova.

Lover Katerina Sabirova was seen at 
the graveside, said Russian news website Life News, which carried 
'exclusive' pictures from the cemetery.

Mr Berezovsky's funeral was due to be held on Monday but had to be postponed until today

Sources have said it could take years to unravel his complex estate

Also among the mourners were the tycoon's six children, it is believed.

Close friend Chechen politician 
Akhmed Zakayev, exiled to Britain and wanted in Russia on alleged 
terrorism offences, was seen at the graveside.

A ceremony at a Greek Orthodox Church preceded the burial, it is understood.

Berezovsky's relatives and friends have disputed that he took his own life.

A firm of accountants has been appointed by the court to act as receivers, although it is believed it could take them months or even years to work its way through the estate

The
 Times has now reported that lawyers, family members and creditors are 
attempting to work out what Mr Berezovsky has left behind.

Insiders have told the paper his complex estate could take years to unravel.

According
 to The Times, two private lawyers, friend Yuli Dubov, his daughter 
Ekaterina Berezovskaya and Helena Gorbunova, his estranged long-time 
partner, have been named as executors.

Mr Berezovsky last year lost a multibillion-pound High Court battle with Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich (pictured)

International accountants Grant Thornton have been appointed as interim receivers until an executor is formally appointed.

Partner at the firm Kevin Hellard has said they intended to submit an initial report to the court within the next month.

However, it is not known whether there is anything left in his assets.

One source told The Times: 'He had nothing at all left, nothing. He couldn't even pay for lunch.'

The oligarch, who last year lost a multibillion-pound High Court battle with Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich, could have run up more than £100 million in legal bills since 2011.

In July 2011, he paid out Britain's biggest-ever divorce settlement to his ex-wife, Galina Besharova.

Reports suggested the deal was worth more than £100 million.

He later built up fees totalling more than £250,000 after becoming embroiled in a case at the High Court with his former partner, Elena Gorbunova, who sat at his side throughout much of his battle with Mr Abramovich.

But one source told The Times a settlement from a legal dispute with the family of a former business partner would have left him a wealthy man.

Mr Berezovsky fell out with Russian President Vladimir Putin and often feared for his life - prompting speculation in Britain and Russia over the manner of his death.

Even though police said they have found no evidence that anyone else was involved, it has not stopped widespread speculation.
