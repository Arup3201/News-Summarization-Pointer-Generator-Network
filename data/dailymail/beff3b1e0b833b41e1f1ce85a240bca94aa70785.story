It's been 'their song' ever since Kanye West chose it for his extravagant proposal to Kim Kardashian.

And for months the rapper, 36, has been trying to convince 'Young and Beautiful' singer Lana Del Rey to perform the soaring ballad for him and his wife-to-be.

Now his wish has come true: the US singer was spotted rehearsing in the hallways of the Palace of Versailles in France on Friday, before performing a tear-jerking show for the couple and their family.

A night to remember: Singer Lana Del Rey sang in front of Kim Kardashian and Kanye West in Versailles, bringing guests to tears during their wedding rehearsal dinner

Reality star Kim, 33, is a huge fan of the song Young and Beautiful, made famous in the Leonardo DiCAprio film The Great Gatsby, and tweeted about it months ago.

'I can’t get this Lana del Rey song out of my head! #youngandbeautiful' she wrote.

The tune was also performed by a brass brand when Kanye popped the question in San Francisco on Kim's birthday on October 21 last year.

In November, website Radar Online reported Kanye had approached Lana about performing her smash hit for his wedding, but the star refused.

'Lana politely declined,' the website reported. '[She] didn’t give any reason for not being able to perform. It was a very firm no from Lana and her camp.”

Now, she's clearly changed her tune.
