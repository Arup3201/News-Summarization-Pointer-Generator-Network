A two-year-old boy died from meningitis after his parent's desperate 999 call got 'lost in the system' and referred to NHS Direct meaning a paramedic was not sent out until it was too late to save him.

Dusan Spivak was rushed to the Royal Derby Hospital a full hour-and-a-half after his parents called the emergency services - but by then medics said it was too late to save his life.

An inquest heard how Dusan's family, originally from the Czech Republic, 
had dialled 999 at 10.26pm on May 29 last year after a large rash formed 
quickly on the youngster's belly at their home in Normanton, Derbyshire.

Michelle Summonds, acting service 
delivery manager for East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS), said that because none 
of the family members spoke English, it was 'difficult' for the 
call handler to determine how serious the incident was.

She admitted the call handler failed to source an interpreter, which meant he did not grasp how serious the situation was.

As
a result, he wrongly chose to involve NHS Direct, when it was the EMAS 
Clinical Assessment Team - which deal with more urgent 999 calls - which
needed to be sent details. He
also failed to complete the referral form to NHS Direct.

The inquest at Derby Coroner's Court heard a second 999 call, which was properly handled, was made at 10.50pm and led to a paramedic arriving at the scene at 11.29pm.

Assistant deputy coroner Paul McCandles, ruled that had the first 999 call been handled correctly, a 
paramedic would have arrived approximately 13 minutes earlier.

Dr William Carroll, who led frantic 
efforts to save the youngster told the inquest the boy had developed meningococcal septicaemia - a 
life-threatening infection brought on by meningitis.

He said it was a condition that can bring about death very quickly and that 'every minute counts'.

Asked if Dusan would have lived had he arrived at hospital sooner, Dr Carroll replied: 'Probably, yes'.

Mr McCandles, said it was 'not possible to say' 
whether Dusan would have survived had the earlier call not been 'lost in the system' and the response been 13 minutes 
quicker.

It also emerged that a paramedic chose to go against national guidelines when it came to treating Dusan at the house.

Paul Whitfield - the first paramedic to arrive - said the boy was so ill it was clear he needed a dose of the antibiotic benzylpenicillin.

Guidelines stated the drug should not be administered if the medic is unsure about whether the patient has any allergies. Mr Whitfield said this was impossible to determine as nobody in the house spoke English.

Based on the fact the child’s condition was rapidly deteriorating, he instructed a colleague to administer the benzylpenicillin.

Mr McCandless said the paramedic was 'between the devil and the deep, blue sea' and that he should be praised for 'bravely' making the call that he did.

The inquest was also told about a 'missed opportunity' earlier in the day to uncover the serious nature of Dusan’s illness.

Dusan’s grandfather, also called Dusan Spivak, phoned Lister House Surgery Normanton, on the day the toddler fell ill.

Mr Spivak explained, via a telephone interpreting service, that Dusan had a fever, pain in his stomach and was struggling to breathe.

The receptionist, Claire Nicholas, advised him to fetch some medicine from a pharmacy to 'bring his temperature down'. Giving evidence, she admitted she should have 'concentrated more on the abdominal pain'.

However, Mr McCandless did not criticise her actions, pointing out that there had been no clear signs to suggest the Dusan was seriously ill and that she advised Mr Spivak to call back if his condition deteriorated.

In delivering his verdict, Mr McCandless said Dusan had fallen victim to a condition that was every parent’s and medic’s 'worst nightmare'.

Afterwards, a spokesperson for EMAS said it was 'sorry for the error in the categorisation of the call', and that action had been taken to prevent the incident happening again.
