Jeremy Hunt has warned senior NHS executives there will be 'consequences' if they have wrongly gagged a former manager from speaking out about concerns over patient safety.

Gary Walker has said he was paid £500,000 to keep quiet after he was removed as chief executive of the United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust.

But this week he broke his silence about a care scandal that may have cost the lives of 670 patients.

In doing so, he ignored an email from NHS-funded lawyers ordering him to respect the terms of the gagging order in 2011.

Warning phone calls followed the letter when it became clear he planned to tell BBC Radio 4’s Today programme about his ordeal.

He was told: ‘Should you breach the term relating to confidentiality, you will immediately repay to the trust, on demand, all sums paid under this agreement in full.’

Refusing to be cowed, Mr Walker gave interviews to the BBC and the Daily Mail. In them, he attacked both the current head of the NHS, Sir David Nicholson, and one of his key sidekicks, Dame Barbara Hakin.

Mr Walker said Sir David, who faced calls to quit last week for his failure to stop the scandal of high death rates at Stafford Hospital, had been warned about problems in Lincolnshire in 2009 but was ‘not interested in patient safety’.

He also accused Dame Barbara of halting a review into worrying high mortality rates at the trust. Staff were also told ‘targets must be met regardless of demand’.

Today, the Health Secretary said he was 
concerned that Mr Walker, the former chief executive of United 
Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust, appeared to have been 'leaned on'.

Mr Hunt said he is ready to order NHS bosses to reverse the gagging order if it is found to have breached NHS guidelines.

He has written to Paul Richardson, chairman of the trust, to tell him it is not an acceptable way to behave when an NHS manager raises concerns about patient safety.

Mr Hunt told BBC Radio 4’s World At One programme: 'I don’t think this is acceptable, I think it is the wrong thing to do.

'I don’t want to make a judgment about the truth or otherwise about what Gary Walker said. Obviously there are very, very serious allegations that we need to get to the bottom of but I’m determined to get to the bottom of it.'

The Francis Report into the Mid-Staffordshire scandal called for a ban on the use of gagging orders that prevented concerns being raised about patient safety.

Mr Hunt said he had written to the Trust to find out the contents of the settlement so he could establish if it was in line with NHS guidelines on whistle-blowing.

He added: 'If it isn’t, of course I will insist that they change it.

'First of all, we must have a culture where people are not afraid to speak out and secondly I was very concerned that it appeared that someone was being leaned on not to speak out and most of all I want to get to the bottom of whether there is any truth in what he was saying.'

Asked if the senior staff at the Trust faced being sacked if there had been mismanagement, he said: 'If they have got this wrong there will be consequences, yes, but I want to investigate and find out and get to the bottom of what actually happened before I make a judgment on that.'

Mr Hunt said for too long there had been a culture of celebrating success in the NHS but “not being honest about failure”.

Mr Walker was sacked in 2010 for gross professional misconduct over alleged swearing at a meeting.

He claims he was forced to quit for 
refusing to meet Whitehall targets for non-emergency patients when the 
trust came under pressure because of soaring demand for beds for 
emergency patients.

East Midlands Strategic Health 
Authority said it “utterly refuted” Mr Walker’s claims and acted at all 
times 'in the interest of patients'.

United Lincolnshire Hospitals Trust is one of 14 being investigated by health chiefs over high mortality rates in the wake of the public inquiry report into serious failures at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust.
