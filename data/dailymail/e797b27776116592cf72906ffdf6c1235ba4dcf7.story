Spiking allegations: Joyce Emmons told TMZ that the comedian slipped her Quaalude when she was in his Las Vegas hotel suite in the 1970s

Aftermath: She described how the comedian told her the pill would be 'a little strong', then hours after she took it, she woke up naked in bed alongside one of Cosby's friends

When he gave her the substance, she claims Cosby told her it was a 'little strong', but it it caused her to black out.  

She added that, even though she never saw Cosby drink or take drugs, he had a drawer full of pills.

Emmons, who was born in Brooklyn, said women would sometimes take the drugs 'knowingly or voluntarily' while men partied after taking them. 

She claims Cosby drugged her, but has not accused him of sexual assault.  

Quaalude, which is also referred to as Methaqualone - a sedative-hypnotic substance that acts as a depressant to the central nervous system.

It was used in the 1970s as a muscle relaxant and as a cure for insomnia. It is still believed to be used as a recreational drug around the world. 

Emmons' claims are similar to many others made by women against the comedian. 

Ten women have come forward in the last month saying they were attacked by Cosby, with Renita Chaney Hill, Louisa Moritz and Andrea Leslie the latest additions.

Four of the women claim they were teenagers at the time.

One of the accusers is supermodel Janice Dickinson, who claims that during a dinner in 1982 the actor gave her a pill and when she woke up he was on top of her.

Supplies: Emmons said that she never saw Cosby drink or do drugs, but claims he still had a 'drawer full of pills' at his disposal 

Another four women; Barbara Bowman, Joan Tarshis, Tamara Green and Therese Serignese have all shared remarkably similar stories in which they claim to have shared a drink or a pill with Cosby and then woken up after or while they say he was sexually assaulting them.

Lawyers for Cosby have dismissed all the claims as untrue while the star has refused to make any comment.

Cosby's attorney, Martin Singer, has released a statement calling recent rape allegations 'increasingly ridiculous' and 'completely illogical.'

'This situation is an unprecedented example of the media's breakneck rush to run stories without any corroboration or adherence to traditional journalistic standards,' says Singer.

'Over and over again, we have refuted these new unsubstantiated stories with documentary evidence, only to have a new uncorroborated story crop up out of the woodwork. When will it end?'

He then closes by saying, 'It is long past time for this media vilification of Mr. Cosby to stop.'
