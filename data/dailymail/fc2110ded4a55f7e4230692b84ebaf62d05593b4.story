A 13-year-old boy from Florida has been charged in the grisly stabbing death of a middle-aged homeless man over the weekend.

Yoel Munoz, from Cape Coral, was taken into custody Sunday in connection to the murder of 51-year-old Thomas Bergstrom, who was discovered stabbed to death in his shelter in the woods a mile away from the teen's home.

Thomas Bergstrom was found just before noon Saturday behind the Cape Coral Christian Center suffering from multiple knife wounds.

Anthony Cashdollar, 18, told the Fort Myers News Press that he was the one who came upon the grisly crime scene when he stopped by Bergstrom's improvised lodging to show him his new dirt bike.

The teen said he saw the 51-year-old vagrant lying face down with blood on his arm and mouth.

Cashdollar called out for help, alerting Bergstrom's friend and roommate Danny Brauer.

‘I saw Tommy laying there, flies everywhere.’ Brauer told Naples News. ‘I said, “Call 911 now."’

Police officers who were called to the scene found clues linking Yoel Munoz to the stabbing. 

According to Cape Coral investigators, the 13-year-old armed with a bagel knife went to the nearby homeless camp Saturday night, stabbed Bergstrom as he was watching TV and then returned home.

Officers also discovered strange messages written in blood on a white hockey mask left at the scene of the slaying. The presumed murder weapon turned up in a nearby pond.

During an interview with police, Munoz's mother confirmed that she had bought her son a similar hockey mask.

Munoz went to a local hospital at around 4am to be treated for a stab wound to his thigh. He reportedly offered conflicting stories to explain the origin of his injury.

A hospital report obtained by WINK News stated that Munoz told officers he had been attacked by 10 men because he no longer wanted to be a part of their gang.

According to detectives, the boy also had blood on his face, which matched the pattern of the hockey mask found in the woods next to Bergstrom's body.

A search of Munoz's home turned up smears of blood on a wall and a bed, and a pair of blood-soaked shoes inside plastic bags stashed in the garage.

Detectives believe the suspected teenage killer and his victim had no contact with one another prior to the deadly stabbing.

Munoz's brother, Lazaro Ordonez, has come to the 13-year's defense, telling NBC 2 that his sibling got mixed up with the wrong crowd, but that he was 'innocent.' The suspect's mother sounded a similar note when interviewed by WZVN.

'He's not a violent child, he a homebody, he's not a child who's on the streets, he's well educated, and has a good heart,' said Mayling Suarez.

Thomas Bergstrom apparently became homeless after losing his job as a carpenter and handyman as a result of a workplace accident.

His roommate Bauer said the 51-year-old had told him that he was successful and even had a lobster boat in Massachusetts.

After he became disabled, Bergstrom moved to Florida and settled in a makeshift camp in the woods, where he spent much of his time collecting empty soda cans to supplement his Social Security payments.

According to Mr Bauer, Bergstrom used his meager income to buy alcohol and cigarettes.

On Monday, an impassive Yoel Munoz was led into juvenile court where a judge ordered the 13-year-old held in secure detention for three weeks pending his next court appearance August 21.
