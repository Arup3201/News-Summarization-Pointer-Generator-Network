A mentally-ill killer whose mother was forced to seal and shackle him in a homemade cage for 11 years in China has been freed.

Wu Yuanhong beat a 13-year-old boy to death in his village in Ruichang, Jiangxi Province, in 2001, while reportedly suffering a 'psychotic episode'.

But he was released home a year later after doctors ruled he suffered from mental illness.

Unable to cope and afraid he may strike again, Wu's mother, Wang Muxiang, 74, welded the cage together herself after local blacksmiths refused for fear he might seek revenge if ever released.

Freedom: Wu climbs from the cage for the first time since he was sealed inside 11 years ago

Wang Muxiang described how she was forced to build it herself.

'I wielded the cage while crying heavily. Although he suffers from mental illness and killed a person, he still is my son.

'Thinking I am making a cage to lock him in, my heart was broken.'

For the past 11 years, she has given her 
son three meals a day, placing a cloth over the cage and providing a pan
when he needs the toilet.

'Every time I delivered food, I would sit at his cage and cry,' she reportedly said, adding: 'Now my tears are dried up.'

The Ministry of Health said in 2010 that there were only about 20,000
psychiatrists to serve the country's population of 1.35 billion, the 
state-run China Daily reported.

Authorities estimated in 
2009 that about 170 million people had some form of mental illness, 
while more than 16 million suffered from severe mental health problems.

In 2001, Wu beat to death a 13-year-old boy in the same village. He was released home a year later because he suffered from mental illness

Mother Wang Muxiang tried to find someone who would weld her a strong cage for her son. The local blacksmiths refused out of fear the sick man may attack them in revenge if he escaped

Last year it emerged that another mentally disabled Chinese man has 
spent almost his entire life locked inside a wooden cage because his 
family cannot afford to look after him.

Tragic
Wei Yun, 23, who lives in Gongchuan village, in southern China's 
Guangxi Province is unable to walk or talk and can only crawl.

As
a young child he was allowed to crawl around the home but at the age of
two he knocked over aÂ  pot of boiling water and almost died.

From then on his parents began to lock him in a wooden cage for his own safety.

Wei's
father works away from home and rarely has the time to visit, meaning 
there is no one to watch over Wei while his stepmother Nong is out 
working during the day.
