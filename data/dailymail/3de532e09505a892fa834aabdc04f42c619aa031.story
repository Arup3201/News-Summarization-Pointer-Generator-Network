Tributes poured in from across the globe yesterday as world leaders affirmed that Lady Thatcher's towering legacy stretched far beyond her own country.

She reversed decades of declining British influence abroad as her championing of western liberal values and passionate hatred of communism inspired rebels and reformers in every continent.

From the US to old foes in the former Soviet block, politicians and business chiefs praised Lady Thatcher, the international stateswoman.

Barack Obama led the tributes in the US – which came from both parties – saying the world 'has lost one of the great champions of freedom and liberty, and America has lost a true friend'.

He continued: 'As a grocer's daughter 
who rose to become Britain's first female prime minister, she stands as 
an example to our daughters that there is no glass ceiling that can't be
 shattered.

'As prime minister, she helped restore
 the confidence and pride that has always been the hallmark of Britain 
at its best. And, as an unapologetic supporter of our transatlantic 
alliance, she knew that with strength and resolve we could win the Cold 
War and extend freedom's promise.

'Here in America, many of us will 
never forget her standing shoulder to shoulder with President Reagan, 
reminding the world that we are not simply carried along by the currents
 of history – we can shape them with moral conviction, unyielding 
courage and iron will.

'Michelle and I send our thoughts to 
the Thatcher family and all the British people as we carry on the work 
to which she dedicated her life – free peoples standing together, 
determined to write our own destiny.'

Mikhail Gorbachev, now 82 and the 
Soviet leader whose reforming qualities Lady Thatcher was the first to 
recognise, said she was a 'great politician and an exceptional person'.

Mr Gorbachev paid tribute to a 
'politician whose word carried great weight' and while their 
relationship was not always smooth, their eventual 'mutual 
understanding' thawed relations between the Soviets and the West, ending
 the Cold War, he said.

Russian prime minister Dmitry 
Medvedev, whose Soviet forebears coined Lady Thatcher's 'Iron Lady' 
nickname as an insult, saluted her as an 'outstanding politician who did
 much for her country...it is impossible not to respect her for her 
character and political will'.

The international praise seemed most 
heartfelt in Europe's former communist states where liberal leaders 
thanked a doughty friend who not only helped deliver their countries 
from communism but also inspired the free market reforms that followed.

Lech Walesa, the Polish politician  
who led the Solidarity movement and was his country's first president 
after communism, hailed Lady Thatcher as a 'great person…who did a 
great deal for the world' and 'contributed to the demise of communism' 
across central Europe.

Former Czech president and prime minister Vaclav Klaus said she was 'simply one of the greatest politicians of our time'.

Although she had an often fraught 
relationship with EU colleagues, western European leaders paid tribute 
to her transformation of the UK, if not her struggle to reform the 
union.

The European Commission – focus of 
much of her derision in the 1980s – described her diplomatically as a 
'circumspect yet engaged player' in the EU.

Commission President JOSE Manuel 
Barroso hailed her as 'without doubt a great stateswoman' and praised 
her role in bringing central and eastern Europe into the EU 'family'.

French socialist president  Francois 
Hollande said 'la dame de fer' had been a 'great personality' whose 
relationship with France was 'always frank and loyal'.

German chancellor Angela  Merkel 
described Lady Thatcher as an 'outstanding leader of the politics of her
 time' who 'shaped modern Britain like few before her'.

Her foreign 
minister Guido Westerwelle said the Tory leader 'leaves behind a rich 
heritage for the history of Europe and the world'.

In 1986, Lady Thatcher became the 
first British PM to visit Israel. Benjamin Netanyahu, its prime 
minister, hailed her not only as a 'staunch friend of Israel and the 
Jewish people', but as a 'woman of greatness' who inspired a generation 
of political leaders.

Julia Gillard, Australia's first woman prime minister, described her time in office as a 'history-making achievement'.

The Pope said he recalled 'with 
appreciation the Christian values which underpinned her [Lady 
Thatcher's] commitment to public service and to the promotion of freedom
 among the family of nations.'
