For travellers who want to holiday like a celebrity, it’s the perfect package.

The luxury private resort in Thailand where Kim Kardashian stayed is auctioning breaks – including the very rooms the reality TV star slept in - for charity.

Iniala Beach House, in Phuket, was thrust into the global spotlight this year, after the mother-of-one posted that bikini selfie on Instagram.

Kim, 33, who tied the knot with rapper Kayne West in May, stayed at the resort with their baby North in the month leading up to the big day.

The high-end 10-residence resort can cost up to £48,000 to rent per week usually - boasting its own spa, a stunning beach, and personal butlers.

Of the penthouse where Kim stayed, the resort says: 'The Iniala Penthouse, designed by Graham Lamb, is an experiment in 21st century living.

'The floor is a sculptured piece of furniture; after removing your shoes and entering the living space, the floor melts beneath your feet like sand.

'The bedroom contains an oversized suspended bed, a three-person hot tub and a beautiful open shower.'

The
 stunning resort, which is spread over three villas and a penthouse, is 
situated on the beautiful golden sands of Natai beach facing the 
turquoise waters of the Andaman Sea.

And guests will be able to stay there at 70 per cent cheaper than the usual price in August, as it is selling the week-long breaks in a bid to raise money for charity.

Holiday bidding: Packages for guests wanting to stay at the resort start at £2,950 up to £5,750

There are 16 exclusive holiday packages to be won, with successful bidders helping towards the £146,000 the resort is aiming to raise for the Inspirasia Foundation, which was set up in memory of 2002 Bali bombing victim Annika Linden.

It will be donating 100 per cent of all room revenue – with packages for guests starting at £2,950 up to £5,750.

Annika’s fiancé Mark Weingard, who owns the resort and set up the charity, said: ‘This auction is just one of the ways that Iniala helps to drive funds and donations for the Inspirasia Foundation. 

‘Our ultimate aim is to create “1000 fires” raising $100million for charity annually by inspiring 1000 business owners worldwide to donate to charity.’

Mark founded Iniala Beach House, which was built after his own holiday home on the same stretch of beach was swept away in the 2004 tsunami.
