A 14-year-old boy hospitalized in a gay-bashing attack has been charged with assault and suspended from school because he threw the first punch at the boys for taunting him.

Eric Martin spent nine days in an intensive ward with a broken arm, severe concussion and heavy spinal bruising after four classmates allegedly called him 'gay' and a 'faggot' then slammed him into a table and repeatedly punched him.

But police investigating the incident at Highland Springs High School in Henrico, Virginia, have decided to bring charges against Eric for instigating the fight.

Eric Martin, 14, has been charged with assault after four gay-bashers beat him so hard he was hospitalized

The teenager has also been barred from returning to classes until he signs a confession admitting he threatened school.

Enraged, his mother Mary Martin said Eric was defending himself against a group of bullies who have repeatedly taunted him with homophobic slurs.

Despite reporting the jibes to Highland Springs, she says, nothing was done to stop them.

'I'm angry, and I'm hurt,' Mary Martin told NBC 12. 'He's got bruises all down the spine of his back where he was just slammed on that table.'

'So in other words the four or five boys can beat my boy to death,' she said, 'and he gets one slap in and gets charged, too? That's plain ridiculous.' 

Suspended: Eric has also been barred from Highland Springs High School, VA, for his 'threatening actions' 

'Bullied': His mother says the bullying boys had been taunted him with homophobic slurs for weeks 

Henrico County Schools spokesperson Andy Jenks released a statement on the issue when it happened, in early September: 'We take very seriously the safety and security of our students, and we are investigating this incident. 

'As always, school divisions are very limited in what information can be made publicly available. 

'Any of our students who are determined to be responsible will be dealt with according to our established disciplinary policies and procedures.'
