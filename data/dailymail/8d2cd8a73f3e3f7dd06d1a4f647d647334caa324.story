Oscar Pistorius could go free because shocking photos from the crime scene were leaked to the public, claims the detective who first led the case. 

Graphic images of the blood-soaked bathroom where the runner shot his model girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp appeared in the media earlier this week.

Now former detective Hilton Botha, who was dropped from the investigation after it emerged he is facing two counts of attempted murder in a separate incident, says the revelation could scupper the prosecution case.

Fears: Runner Oscar Pistorius denies murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp claiming he shot her believing she was an intruder

Criticism: Former South African detective Hilton Botha came under fire for walking over the crime scene without foot protection

He believes they were taken by a corrupt policeman within 48 hours of the fatal incident at Pistorius's house in Pretoria, South Africa, on Valentine's Day.

Botha told the Sunday People: 'It looks like the pictures have been taken one or two days after the scene because on the Saturday (following the shooting) I took it down and sent it away for forensics.

'This is why I took the door down. I knew that anyone could come in and take pictures and both our cases could be b******d.'

Botha said he had heard money was being offered for pictures of the scene.

He believes they were taken by a mobile phone camera and shown to the Pistorious defence team before official crime scene pictures were revealed to lawyers.

In the gruesome images, pools of blood cover the toilet and bathroom floor, with police tape marking the holes where bullets flew 
through the bathroom door, which is missing a panel.

It is thought that the low position of 
the bullet holes will be used by Pistorius's defence team to argue that 
he was not wearing his prosthetic legs at the time of the shooting, so 
could not have planned the murder.

The pictures, obtained by Sky News, also
 show trails of blood leading from the bathroom and down the stairs of 
the house, as the paralympian carried Miss Steenkamp's body and called 
for help.

The Sky footage also shows bloodied 
footprints - thought to have been caused by investigating officer Hilton
 Botha walking into the house without protective covers on his shoes. 

Pistorius, 26, known as the Blade Runner, denies murder but admits shooting Reeva through the bathroom door believing her to be an intruder.

He is back in court on Tuesday for his next bail hearing. The investigation into 29-year-old Miss Steenkamp's death has been heavily criticised.

Botha was forced to step down 
when it emerged he faced seven charges of attempted murder for a 2011 
case in which he and two other officers fired on a vehicle in an attempt
 to make it stop.

He told the Sunday People that when he first began investigating the killing he knew of two potential key witnesses who have since been scared off talking to police.

He said: 'They changed their minds. It sounds to me like someone spoke to them and they don't want to get involved.'

Botha has now quit the South African Police Service to start his own security company. 

Sources told Sky News that other 
officers in the case are being investigated for the disappearance of a 
watch belonging to Pistorius.

His uncle Arnold Pistorius described what life is like for the athlete while he waits for his trial to begin. He has grown a full beard, reading a bible every day and living like a recluse.

He told CNN: 'He is housebound. He doesn't go out in public places. He's not keen to go out. This fits him at the moment.

'He's got photos [of Reeva] in his room, he's got photos all over the places.'

Next-door neighbour Christo Menelaou said Pistorius 'tortures' himself about his girlfriend's death. 'He cries all the time and asks God to take away the pain.'
