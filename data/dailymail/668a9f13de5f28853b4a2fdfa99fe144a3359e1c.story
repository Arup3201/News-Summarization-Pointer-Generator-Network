An elderly motorist was killed in a freak road accident after she was hit by the severed head of a deer that was hit by another car.

Rosemary Bower, 70, died after a deer's head plunged through her windshield, causing her car to careen off the road in rural Reynoldsville, Pennsylvania.

The impact sent the deer hurtling over a car driven by Rocco Ford and Scott Elgoff.

It landed on her vehicle and the impact caused the deer to be cut in half with the head and shoulders hurtling through 70 year old Bower's windshield.

Mrs Bower's car continued driving until it ran off the road into a ditch in rural Reynoldsville.

Police said the other two drivers involved in the death crash will not face any charges.
