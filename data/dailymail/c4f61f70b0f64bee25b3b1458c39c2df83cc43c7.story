Cameroon defender Alex Song has apologised for his red card as his side were thrashed 4-0 by Croatia and crashed out of the World Cup.

Song saw red for elbowing Croatia striker Mario Mandzukic at the end of the first half when his side were already 1-0 down.

Referee Pedro Proenca reached straight for red after Song wildly lashed out at Mandzukic with his arm as Croatia tried to counter down the left-hand side.

Song bowed his head as he trudged from the pitch in Manaus, four years after his spat with Etoâ€™o had split the Cameroon camp. Cameroon lost all three of their games at that tournament, and look to be heading for a similar conclusion in Brazil.

Song later apologised for his part in the off-the-ball scuffle with Mandzukic which resulted in the Barca man heading back to the changing rooms ahead of schedule.In a statement the 26-year-old said: 'I'm very sad at the moment as I feel I have let my country and myself down.

'It was a stupid moment and I'm truly sorry. If I could do anything to take it back I would. Please forgive me.'
