A criminal who was arrested as a man after committing a sexual assault 10 years ago has now been convicted as a woman.

Harold Seymore, 31, is intersex, meaning she was born with functioning male and female reproductive organs, but she was brought up male and kept her condition largely hidden.

But last week, after revealing in custody that she wanted to start living as a woman, Seymore appeared in court in Miami-Dade, Florida wearing a dress she had borrowed from her public defender, the Miami Herald reported.

She was found guilty of sexually assaulting a schoolteacher as the woman walked alone on a beach after leaving a nightclub in South Beach in October 2005.

Locked up: Harold Seymore, pictured with public defender Stacy Marczak at a sentencing hearing last week, has been convicted as a woman - nearly 10 years after she was arrested for sexual battery as a man

She will now be transferred to the state prison system, and could be housed away from the general population with other at-risk inmates needing 'protective management', the Herald reported. 

In court, her victim testified that she had walked past Seymore on the beach and, feeling uneasy, said: 'Don't follow me.'

Seymore then started punching her from behind and sexually assaulted her as she screamed for help, she told the court.

Two passersby chased Seymore, who was caught by police moments later. The woman also had Seymore's DNA beneath her fingernails.

Prosecutors said that while Seymore had had a difficult life as she struggled with her gender identity and mental illness, it was 'no excuse' for the attack and the pain that she had inflicted on her victim. 

In court, Seymore's defense team hoped to prove that she had only punched the woman and had not sexually assaulted her - but the jury didn't buy it.

She was convicted of sexual battery with no great harm, battery and petty theft, and on Friday Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Teresa Mary Pooler sentenced her to 15 years and 10 years probation.

'Based on everything I've heard, I do believe you're a danger and you will continue to be a danger to society,' Pooler said. 

Struggle: Seymore, center with Marczak and public defender Matthew McElligott, was born with female and male reproductive organs and identifies as a woman. She will be kept away from the general prison population

Seymore apologized to the victim as she was sentenced. 

'It wasn't my intention for this to happen,' she said. 'I honestly apologize for what happened.'

Seymore, who has a lengthy criminal history, has always been housed in single-person safety cells in Miami-Dade jails so that she is kept away from the male population. This has meant that she has largely served time in isolation.

'Twenty-three hours a day in solitary,' she told the Miami Herald in an interview. 'I got the yard by myself. I have to take showers by myself.' 

She will now be transferred to the state prison system and will be screened for  risk of sexual victimization or sexual abusiveness twice a year, as is law.

Speaking to the Herald, she called herself a 'hermaphrodite', although that word is considered outdated by LGBT advocates, who prefer the term 'intersex'.

She that she grew up hiding her female sexual organs and her dreams of having children one day, explaining: 'It was safer to identify as a male.'

She was first arrested at age 14 for carrying a concealed weapon to school, and later arrests included battery, petty theft, disorderly conduct and cocaine possession.

Arrests: Since the age of 14, Seymore (left in 2004 and right in 2014) has been arrested multiple times and was arrested in 2005 for sexual battery. The trial was delayed due to numerous stints in psychiatric facilities

She was also diagnosed with bipolar disorder and was repeatedly hospitalized for psychiatric treatment between 2001 and 2006, according to the report.

After her 2005 sexual battery arrest, she struggled with mental illness and was declared mentally incompetent four times by a judge and sent to state psychiatric facilities.

During those stays, she revealed that she wanted to begin living as a woman and started receiving hormone pills. She said that she hopes to give herself a new name - Sofia.

She told the Herald that wearing a Theory dress borrowed from her public defender Stacy Marczak to court for the trial signaled the start of her new life.

'It meant I finally committed,' she said.
