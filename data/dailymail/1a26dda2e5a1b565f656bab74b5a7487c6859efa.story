A married couple accused of spying on Germany for 25 years for their Russian paymasters went on trial today in a case that could lead directly to Vladimir Putin's door.

Andreas and Heidrun Anschlag began their snooping career in the same city, Dresden, where Putin was posted for the KGB.

The duo are accused of first feeding information about West Germany to the former Soviet Union, then the reunited land to the Russian Republic.

The espionage agents for Moscow operated under the radar of the intelligence services sending back their reports to their handlers via a radio code.

'The accused had the task of gathering information about the political and military strategy of the EU and NATO as well as security-relevant political aspects of relations between Germany, the EU and NATO to Russia,' said Germany's prosecutor's office.

An alleged spy in the Dutch Foreign Ministry supplied them with secret European Union and NATO documents from 2008 to 2011. Their trial began today in Stuttgart.

The court heard how Heidrun Anschlag's arrest in the autumn of 2011 was like a scene from a cold war movie - she was tapping out a message back to Russia from her home in Balingen when an armed task force broke in and arrested her mid-transmission.

'Caught red-handed': Heidrun Anschlag, pictured talking to her lawyer in court, was arrested by police in her home in Balingen, Germany, while allegedly typing out a coded message to her masters

Intelligence agencies said the message was intended for the SWR, the agency which replaced the KGB.

It
was also revealed the pair, both now aged 52, had contact to agent OOX -
sexy spy Anna Chapman who was among the sleeper cell that the FBI broke
up in America two years ago.

Investigators
said it was due to information gleaned from the interrogations in 
America that led to the arrests of the spy duo in Germany.

Andreas
and Heidrun were described as 'throwbacks' from the Soviet era who 
stayed on in reunited Germany to serve new masters after the same old 
secrets - industrial, technological and military.

'Clues': The trial heard the pair, both now aged 52, had contact to agent OOX - 'sexpot spy' Anna Chapman (pictured above) who was among the sleeper cell that the FBI broke up in America two years ago

Link? The pair began their snooping career in the same city, Dresden, where Russian President Vladimir Putin was posted for the KGB

While his wife was seized at home, Andreas was arrested while on an alleged business trip in the university city of Marburg.

Two Austrian passports, both said to be forgeries made by the counterfeiters of the SWR, were seized when they were taken into custody. GS9-G commandos - the elite of the German police trained by former officers of Britain's SAS regiment - made the arrests.

The bogus passports stated that Andreas was born in Argentina and Heidrun in Peru. Checks with authorities in both nations proved them to be fakes.

'The accused are suspected of having worked in Germany over a long period of time for a foreign intelligence agency,' the federal prosecutor said in a statement.
