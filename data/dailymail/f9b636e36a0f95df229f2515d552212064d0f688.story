Leon Osman may be a steady, yet unspectacular performer on the field for Everton, but the same can't be said for his rapping skills.

The 33-year-old performed his own rendition of Will Smith's 'Boom! Shake the Room' at his testimonial dinner on Saturday night and it proved to be a big hit with the guests in attendance.

Osman, who has spent over 14 years at Goodison Park, was joined by the likes of Toffees legend Kevin Kilbane and former Everton player Nick Chadwick, with many of the current squad also expected to be in attendance.

The dinner party was held at the Rum Warehouse at the Titanic Hotel in Liverpool, with the proceeds from the night going to Claire House and Make-a-Wish Foundation.

Osman has already had his testimonial match, with Everton drawing 1-1 with Porto at Goodison Park in August.

The veteran midfielder remains an integral part of the Everton squad, making nine appearances in all competitions this season, as Roberto Martinez's side currently sit ninth in the Premier League after 10 games played.
