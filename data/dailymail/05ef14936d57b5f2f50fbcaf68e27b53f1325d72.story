A young gay man has been caught out after he pretended to be a female college student online to chat up straight men.

Aaron Estes, 20, from Lapeer, Michigan, tricked more than 100 different men into believing he was a good-looking blonde called Amanda Miller.

One of the men, Tyler Hayden, had been chatting to 'Amanda' on Facebook for more than a year, though he had never spoken to her on the phone because she told him she didn't own one.

When their relationship became more serious and their chatting increasingly explicit, Hayden enlisted the help of MTV's 'Catfish: The TV Show' to facilitate a meeting and help take things to the next stage.

But the hosts quickly discovered the pretty girl Hayden thought he was talking to, based on pictured she'd sent him, was in fact Estes.

Estes had created Amanda's Facebook profile back when he was a sophomore in high school using photos he'd found on a MySpace profile for a girl called Trina.

'I don't even want to be gay to be honest,' Estes said on the TV show after being found out. 'But that's something you can't change and I accepted that a while ago.'

He revealed that his online deception had seen him get kicked out of college when he was caught chatting with his RA as Amanda.

One time he chatted with up to 100 different men under the guise, he admitted.

After the revelation, Hayden forgave Estes for toying with his emotions, saying he understood that Estes had a difficult life.

And Estes vowed to stop playing the online games, acknowledging that his lies were hurting people.'Catfish: The TV Show' cameraman Max Joseph said someone claiming they don't own a phone is one of those 'big red flags' people shouldn't ignore when forming a relationship online.Â 

Others include people claiming to be models, or refusing to video chat.
