A fraudster who claimed to be Scottish nobility has been jailed for nearly two years after claiming tens of thousands of dollars in benefits while living a life of luxury on a $1.2million yacht in Florida.

Colin Chisholm III, 63, who made $167,000 worth of fraudulent welfare claims in Minnesota, pleaded guilty to two felonies, theft by swindle and wrongfully obtaining public assistance in November. 

On Monday, he bowed his head and did not speak as he was sentenced to 21 months in prison by a Hennepin County judge. The ruling matched the prison time that prosecutors had sought.

Under state sentencing guidelines, Chisholm and his wife, Andrea - who was previously imprisoned for a year and a day in prison for her role in the fraud - could have expected to receive probation.

However, because of the severity of their economic crimes, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman sought prison terms for the pair, who were found to have millions of dollars stashed in the bank.

'This is a fitting end to a crime that never should have occurred,'  Mr Freeman told the Minnesota Star Tribune after the sentencing hearing, which Andrea Chisholm, 54, did not attend.

'We are pleased with the sentence and believe it is one of the longest ever given in the state of Minnesota for welfare fraud.'

After collecting an array of fraudulent medical and food-stamp claims while onboard their yacht, Andrea Aras, the Chisholms moved to a lakeside mansion in an upscale suburb of Minneapolis.

In addition to the six-bedroom home - built in 1909 with five bathrooms and stretch to 5,800 sq ft set on 1.6 acres, according to property records - they also owned a $30,000 Lexus, prosecutors said.

In total, the couple filed more than a dozen forms seeking county and Minnesota state aid over a seven-year period, from late 2004 to 2012. All of these forms failed to disclose where they lived.

The forms also reportedly did not state that  Chisholm was listed as chief executive for a satellite television company in the Caribbean, nor that he had more than $3million stashed in bank accounts.

Meanwhile, Andrea Chisholm, who admitted aiding and abetting the fraud in August and has finished her sentence, was not listed as owner of a  dog kennel that bread and sold championship dogs.

The couple - who once referred to themselves as Scottish nobility, 'Lord and Lady Chisholm' - were arrested in March last year after fleeing Minnesota for the Bahamas. 

Following his arrest, Chisholm admitted: 'I received benefits from Hennepin County I really wasn’t entitled to. I’m taking full responsibility for that.'

At an earlier hearing, Mr Freeman said: 'Too often, people think that only poor people commit crimes. We know that is not true and the Chisholms are a perfect example.

Dynasty: According to their company website, the couple trace their roots to Clan Chisholm in Struy, Scotland 

'What they did was abominable, stealing from the government and the taxpayers while living a luxurious lifestyle.

'That’s why we pushed for a tougher sentence than the probation he normally would have received.'

According to the website for their company Strathglass Kennel, the Chisholms trace their roots to the Clan Chisholm from the small village of Struy in the Scottish Highlands.

They plan to challenge the judge's order to pay more than $167,000 in restitution.
