Fox News personality and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee stunned a New Hampshire crowd on Saturday by likening the federal government's treatment of airport passengers to the totalitarian regime of Kim Jong-un.

'My gosh, I'm beginning to think that there's more freedom in North Korea sometimes than there is in the United States,' he told a partisan crowd at the inaugural New Hampshire Freedom Summit.

'When I go to the airport, I have to get into the surrender position, people put hands all over me, and I have to provide photo ID in a couple of different forms to prove that I'm not going to terrorize the airplane,' he deadpanned.

In a speech filled with jokes, Huckabee seemed deadly serious.

Trouble: Huckabee drew a mix of gasps and applause when he suggested that airport security represents a loss of freedom akin to North Korea's

'More freedom': Huckabee compared Americans' treatment in domestic airports to the North Korean government's treatment of its people

'Surrender position': U.S. airline passengers can expect occasional pat-downs from Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents before they are allowed into boarding areas

Americans welcomed additional security measures after the 9/11 terror attacks but have since grown weary of agents who get up close and personal

His criticism of the Transportation Safety Administration was a segue into his objection to the national debate of voter ID requirements at the polls.

'If I want to go vote, I don't need a thing,' he said. 'All I gotta to do is show up and I can give 'em anybody's name, and that's okay.'

The laughs returned when he quipped that 'the president reminded us yesterday that there's no voter fraud.'

Barack Obama said Friday during a speech to MSNBC host Al Sharpton's National Action Network pressure group that claims of widespread voter fraud – the justification offered by conservatives for laws requiring photo IDs at the polls – are 'bogus.'

'Let's be clear,' Obama said.: 'The real voter fraud is people who try to deny our rights by making bogus arguments about voter fraud.'

Huckabee is an ordained Southern Baptist minister and sometimes musician who served as the governor of Arkansas for 11 years and now hosts a weekend variety show on the Fox News Channel.

He mounted an unsuccessful presidential campaign in 2008, and his name has surfaced again as a possible 2016 White House candidate.

But even if he never reaches 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, he joked that he might show up there unannounced one day for a tour.

When the Secret Service asked him for a photo ID, he said, he would say, 'I figured if I can vote without one, I ought to be able to come in and look around without one too.'

Conservatives at the inaugural New Hampshire Freedom Summit in Manchester turned the parking lot into a carnival of political bumper stickers, including this nod to the tea party

Stern: Fresh from his speech at the 2014 New Hampshire Freedom Summit, Huckabee met with reporters for a brief press conference

Really? North Korean communist leader Kim Jong-un presides over one of the world's most repressive totalitarian regimes, imprisoning millions of his people and restricting economic activity and travel

Huckabee complained about having to produce a government-issued ID in order to pass through airport security -- a measure that's not required when Americans visit the polls on Election Day

Huckabee ended a day full of conservative speakers including former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, business tycoon Donald Trump, and U.S. senators Rand Paul, Mike Lee and Ted Cruz.

Nearly everyone took shots at the IRS, which has raised Republicans' collective blood pressure since news broke 11 months ago that the agency was playing political favorites and targeting right-wing organizations for special scrutiny.

Mercurial: Huckabee's audience knows him as a jovial figure and a sensible television host, but the buzz in New Hampshire reflected a consensus that he had gone too far

Huckabee scowled at 'the criminal enterprise formerly known as the Internal Revenue Service ... that is able to crush any citizen, any organization.'

'It is the one type of entity in America,' he complained, 'where you are guilty until you can prove yourself to be not guilty.'

A shift in the law away from income taxes, and toward taxes on sales and consumption – what advocates call the Fair Tax – 'would rid us of the IRS,' he said.

Later, Huckabee told MailOnline that he's serious about doing away with the IRS entirely.

'Most states have their own taxing authority and tax auditing capability,' Huckabee said. 'It could be handled with the states.'

'When I look at what they have become, and threat that they are to the liberty of Americans, it's very frightening to me.'

'For them to take personal, confidential information of taxpayers, or groups, and to share that information illegally in a way to try to hurt those individuals and groups? That's criminal,' he added.

'We shouldn't be sponsoring, paying for, subsidizing and legislating a criminal enterprise.

MailOnline asked if there were other federal agencies that he thought should be scrapped.

'I'm not a candidate,' he cautioned. 'So let me hold off on giving you the full platform.'
