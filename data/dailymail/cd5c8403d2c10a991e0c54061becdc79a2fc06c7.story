Former television presenter Emma Freud was presented with an OBE today by the Queen for her work as a Comic Relief trustee.

She co-founded the charity in 1985 with her partner Richard Curtis and has helped to produce live television documentaries for it for around eight years.

In March, Comic Relief's Red Nose Day 
televised extravaganza raised £74.3million, the highest amount pledged 
in a night in the event's 23-year history.

The total figure raised topped £102million - breaking the previous record of £82.3million set in 2009.

Today the Queen also knighted Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King and racehorse trainer Sir Henry Cecil at Buckingham Palace.

The trio were all given their awards in the Queen's Birthday Honour's List.

Comic Relief founder: Ms Freud, a broadcaster, paid tribute to the generosity of British people who have given to the charity since it was founded in 1985

Mother-of-four Ms Freud said after being given her OBE that Comic Relief had been successful because of the generosity of ordinary British people.

She said: 'I don't feel like it (the OBE) belongs to us, it belongs to the British 
people, and that is the biggest compliment.

'The total we raised this year is unbelievable, this year we're three years into a recession and people are still giving.'

A hero Australian soldier who won his 
country's highest gallantry medal after drawing the fire of three 
Taliban machine gun posts to protect comrades met the Queen today.

The monarch held an audience with 
Corporal Benjamin Roberts-Smith - awarded the Victoria Cross for 
Australia - to hear first hand about his actions.

During an operation in Afghanistan the
soldier ran out in front of the Taliban machine gunners after his 
comrades were pinned down by fire.

The SAS corporal then single-handedly 
cleared two of the enemy positions during the fight near the village of 
Tizak in Kandahar province in June last year.

Cpl Roberts-Smith said: 'Obviously she speaks to quite a lot of soldiers so she's
interested in Afghanistan (and) she has a good grasp of what's 
happening there.'

Asked about the monarch's reaction to his story he replied: 'She was just glad that we all came home.'

The soldier admitted that he was nervous before meeting the Queen but said it was easy to talk to her.

'She is everything that everyone says 
she is - she's just a lovely lady and she made me very comfortable. It 
was one of those experiences - very humbling, very surreal.'

She returned to the Palace today where she 
was famously pictured with her father Sir Clement Freud, who died in 
2009, when he was knighted in 1987.

Ms Freud was the script editor of the 
hit British movies Four Weddings And A Funeral and Notting Hill - both 
written by her partner Richard Curtis.

Meanwhile, Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King paid tribute to his staff after receiving his honour.

The 63-year-old has helped steer the economy through dire financial waters during the worst economic crisis since the Depression of the 1930s.

But the bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), which sets interest rates and is chaired by Sir Mervyn, has been accused of being 'asleep at the wheel' in the run-up to the downturn by a former member of the panel.

After being given the Knight Grand Cross at the investiture ceremony today, the governor returned to his seat in the palace's ballroom without commenting to the press.

When his new title was announced in June, Sir Mervyn said: 'I am honoured to receive this award.

'It is a tribute to the hard work and professionalism of the Bank of England staff, whom it has been my privilege to lead for eight years'.

Sir Henry Cecil, arguably Britain's greatest racehorse trainer who has known the Queen for many years, said after receiving his knighthood that he had been 'very lucky'.

He is a four-time Derby winner, has had eight successes in the Oaks and has been behind a total of 25 Classic winners, including this year's 2000 Guineas hero Frankel.

Sir Henry is also a popular figure in racing, both at meets and with ordinary punters in betting shops across the country.

The trainer said: 'It's a way of life - I like a challenge and my life's been full of challenges and I'm very honoured to receive this, this is the biggest honour I'll get in my lifetime.'

Sir Henry played down his achievements over the past 40 years, adding jokingly: 'I was the first person from my prep school to fail common entry to Eton so I think I was qualified to be a porter - I've been very lucky.'
