Dawn Aubrey-Ward's stepfather called on RSPCA to 'stop bullying people'

The family of an RSPCA whistle-blower who committed suicide have spoken for the first time about her death, launching a blistering attack on the charity and calling on it to ‘stop bullying people’. 

Animal welfare officer Dawn Aubrey-Ward, 43, took her own life after publicly accusing the RSPCA of needlessly killing thousands of healthy animals. 

An inquest heard this week how the mother-of-four was discovered dead at home, just five months after she helped reveal in The Mail on Sunday that the charity had destroyed 53,000 animals in a year.  Her family say the RSPCA is partly responsible for her death.

Miss Aubrey-Ward had spoken out after she left her job when she was accused of stealing a tortoise. She had claimed the animal was an unwanted pet which she had taken home to look after.

Miss Aubrey-Ward’s stepfather, Michael Newport, said: ‘They treated her very, very badly. 

‘If Dawn had been allowed to pursue her career with the RSPCA, which had been her childhood dream, I don’t think she would have gone down the road she did. If they had left her alone, she would have had a happy life.’ 

Mr Newport, a parish councillor, added: ‘I feel very strongly that she was badly treated by the RSPCA. They behave like a paramilitary organisation. They have to stop bullying people.’

Mr Newport, who is married to Miss Aubrey-Ward’s mother, Jean, is sad that his twice-divorced step-daughter did not live to witness the torrent  of criticism that the RSPCA received  following her decision to become  a whistleblower. 

‘She would have wallowed in all the well-deserved bad publicity surrounding the charity since she blew the whistle on them in The Mail on Sunday. Hearing that the Charity Commission is investigating them would have made her very happy.’

According to her family, Miss Aubrey-Ward dreamed of becoming an RSPCA inspector all her life

Jean Newport, 64, of Stoke St Mary, Somerset, said: ‘Dawn was extremely distressed because lots of nasty things were said about her. 

‘She had loved animals ever since she was a tiny child, and would go without food herself to feed her animals when she was broke.

‘Becoming an RSPCA inspector was a dream come true. She was over the moon when she qualified in 2008.’

Miss Aubrey-Ward, who was found hanged at her home in Matlock, Somerset, in May, strongly disagreed with her employer’s policy of putting down animals that couldn’t easily be re-homed.

In an interview in The Mail on 
Sunday, the former inspector, who once won an RSPCA award for rescuing a
 stranded sheep from a cliff face, accused the RSPCA of killing 
thousands of creatures unnecessarily.

Her
 mother said: ‘It was OK if the animals were very sick or too 
traumatised to be pets, but it wasn’t just those animals that died.

The 44-year-old animal lover was treated 'very badly' by the charity according to her family who have accused them of bullying

'She told me lots of horrible stories, and got very angry and upset.

‘The job wasn’t what she had expected it to be, and her idea of  animal welfare was very different to that of the RSPCA. She found it tough, and when she didn’t agree with what was going on she had to speak her mind. She stuck to her principles and that made her unpopular.’

Mrs Newport said her daughter had been ‘devastated’ by some of the Twitter comments from ex-colleagues following the whistleblowing episode.

‘She was particularly distressed by one posting which said she didn’t care for her own animals, which she felt put a question mark over her as an animal lover. It was rubbish, but she took it to heart.

'Life will never be the same without Dawn. She was such a lovely, caring clever young woman. I can’t get used to her being gone. It just doesn’t seem real.’

The inquest heard how Miss Aubrey-Ward had been suffering from depression after her partner, Rob Colclough, had taken his own life in October 2011.

She had also been experiencing financial difficulties and had issues with alcohol.

After her disclosures last December, the charity released a statement saying she was ‘merely a disgruntled former employee’ and suggesting she was motivated by malice.

Asked if she believed her daughter’s treatment at the hands of the RSPCA could have contributed to her suicide, Mrs Newport said: ‘We will never know. I’m  not going to get into an argument with the RSPCA – they are much bigger than I am.’ 

The RSPCA said: ‘Our thoughts are with the family and friends of Dawn Aubrey-Ward. Her death and the circumstances surrounding it are tragic and it would not be appropriate for us to comment further.’
