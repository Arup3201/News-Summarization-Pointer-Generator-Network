Katie Couric is launching her new talk show in dramatic fashion by inviting Amanda Knox's former boyfriend Raffaele Sollecito to give his first-ever U.S. interview since being acquitted of murder last year.

Aimee Copeland, the Georgia student who lost both hands, her left leg and right foot to a rare flesh-eating disease will also appear using prosthetic limbs to walk on to the stage.

'Katie' launches on September 10 and will also see the former CBS anchor interview celebrity friends  such as Jessica Simpson and Sheryl Crow.

Simpson will talk about becoming a mother for the first time after giving birth to daughter Maxwell in May with fiancé Eric Johnson.

The singer and fashion designer is reportedly determined to shed yet more baby weight for her appearance. She gained around 70lbs during pregnancy and her new contract as a WeightWatchers spokeswoman requires her to lose 20-30lb by the end of August - or miss out on a $4million signing bonus.

Singer Sheryl Crow will appear on the nationally-syndicated talk show to talk for the first time about being diagnosed with a brain tumour.

Guest Aimee Copeland will discuss her story of survival with Couric. She contracted a rare infection in May after falling from a zip line and gashing her leg. Doctors had to amputate both hands, her left leg and right foot.

She returned home last week after three months in the hospital and a rehabilitation clinic but still faces a rigorous recovery process.

Breaking his silence: Raffaele Sollecito will also speak for the first time about his relationship with Amanda Knox after the pair were acquitted last year over the murder of Meredith Kercher in Perugia, Italy in 2009

Raffaele Sollecito talks for the first time on American television about 
the 2009 murder case of Meredith Kercher that made international headlines.

He will discuss life after his time spent in an Italian prison and his reunion with Amanda.

Sharon and Lexie Love, whose daughter and sister Yeardley was murdered two years ago by her ex-boyfriend, University of Virginia lacrosse player George Huguely V, will also talk to Couric about their devastating loss.

Other guests in the opening weeks include Jennifer Lopez, Heidi Klum, Susan Sarandon, Chelsea Handler, Sofia Vergara, Demi Lovato and Wendy Williams. Barbra Streisand will make a rare appearance and also perform.

The premiere season of Couric's highly-anticipated new talk show will also see author EL James discuss her literary phenomenon 50 Shades Of Grey.

The budget for Couric's new ABC show is unknown but the 55-year-old host herself is reportedly being paid $40million by the network.

The weekday show is a new venture for Couric who publicly bashed her former employer this week.

She said in an interview with Good 
Housekeeping magazine that she felt 'liberated' after leaving CBS and 
that her five years at the station were miserable because bosses were 
'projecting their own issues onto me'.
