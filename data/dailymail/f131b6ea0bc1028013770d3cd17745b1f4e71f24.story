Justin Bieber has called for new laws for paparazzi following the 'tragic' death of a photographer who was run over and killed while taking pictures of the star's sportscar.

A 29-year-old freelance photographer, named by TMZ as Chris Guerra, was struck by a vehicle on Tuesday night after taking pictures of the singer's white $200,000 Ferrari in Los Angeles.

The star's friend, 19-year-old rapper Lil Twist, was behind the wheel of the 458 Italia Ferrari when it was pulled over by police - prompting Guerra to get out of his own car as he believed Bieber was in the vehicle.

The 18-year-old today released a statement in which he said his 'thoughts and prayers' were with Guerra's friends and family.

In his statement, Bieber said: 'While I was not present nor directly 
involved with this tragic accident, my thoughts and prayers are with the
family of the victim.

'Hopefully this tragedy will finally 
inspire meaningful legislation and whatever other necessary steps to 
protect the lives and safety of celebrities, police officers, innocent 
public bystanders, and the photographers themselves.'

Chris Guerra was tailing Bieber’s white Ferrari when it was pulled over by California Highway Patrol officers on an I-405 off ramp in L.A.

He got out of his car to take pictures but was struck by a Toyota Highlander SUV as he was running back to his own vehicle after being told to return to his vehicle repeatedly by police.

Photographs taken from the scene show Guerra's hat and shoe lying in the road where he was hit. He was wearing the same baseball cap on one of the last time he was photographed last month in Aspen, Colorado.

It is believed the female driver of the car which struck the photographer stopped other cars from hitting the man's body after she had called 911.

Guerra was a freelance photographer who submitted pictures to AKI images/GSI Media for syndication, the company confirmed today.

Los Angeles police officer Sergeant Rudy Lopez said the highway patrol men had noticed the photographer taking pictures close to the scene. He said one of the officers asked him to return to his vehicle.

Sgt Lopez said: 'He verbally ordered 
him to return to the vehicle, he had to order him twice and he seemed 
reluctant to go back, but eventually he did.

'When
the photographer returned to the vehicle it did not appear that he was 
looking and he was struck by a vehicle traveling southbound.'

Guerra died at a hospital shortly after the crash.

The
sports car - which contained two of Bieber's friends, with rapper Lil Twist believed to be behind the wheel - was parked on the side of Sepulveda Boulevard near Getty 
Center Drive after the traffic stop.

According to sources, Lil Twist - real name Christopher Moore - was with Bieber at the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills on Tuesday afternoon when he left in the white Ferrari without Justin.

Twist, who is a Lil Wayne protege, and Bieber have been hanging out and partying together for the past few weeks.

They even celebrated New Year's Eve together by popping champagne bottles in Mexico, where they're both of legal drinking age.

No charges are likely to be filed against the motorist - believed to be female - who hit the man.

The LAPD is continuing to investigate the man’s death. A representative for the department did not immediately return MailOnline's request for comment.

According to TMZ, Guerra claimed to friends earlier in the day that he had spotted Bieber smoking what he believed to be marijuana from a pipe while driving the Ferrari.

A source said the photographer told him he was following the singer back to the Four 
Seasons and was continuing to pursue what he believed was a big story.

The
source says after 20 minutes, Guerra hung up as he said the Ferrari was 
pulling out of the hotel parking lot and he needed to hang up and follow
it.  Apparently he had no idea Bieber in the car.

The longtime friend, who spoke with Chris at 5:16 PM - less than an hour before he was killed - was one of his closest friends told TMZ he belived Bieber is partly to blame for Guerra's death because of the singer's reckless driving history and alleged pot smoking which made it a big story to follow.

Bieber had already been pulled over by police in his Ferrari while driving through West Hollywood in November. He was initially pulled over for making an unsafe left turn. During the stop, the officer discovered Bieber's registration was expired and he was given a ticket.

Bieber had helped ring in the new year, performing on 'Dick Clark's Rockin' New Year's Eve' on Monday night.

Anti-paparazzi: Miley Cyrus vented her anger over the tragic accident in Los Angeles

Reacting to the accident, former child star Miley Cyrus took to Twitter to call the paparazzi 'fools'.

The Disney star, now 20, tweeted: 'Hope this paparazzi/JB accident brings on some changes in '13 Paparazzi are dangerous! Wasn't Princess Di enough of a wake up call?!

'It is unfair for anyone to put this on to Justin's conscious as well! This was bound to happen! Your mom teaches u when your a child not to play in the street!

'The chaos that comes with the paparazzi acting like fools makes it impossible for anyone to make safe choices.'

Bieber has had a gruelling couple of months.Only last month, a gruesome plot to murder the Canadian crooner was revealed.

Trouble: Justin Bieber was pulled over in his Ferarri by cops in West Hollywood in November and given a ticket

Mark Staake and his nephew, Tanner Ruane, were allegedly plotting to kidnap, torture, and kill the singer while he was in New York to perform at Madison Square Garden.

Martin had ordered for ‘the murder and castration’ of the 18-year-old singer.

And in November, the ‘Baby’ singer had a run-in with a paparazzo who claimed Bieber was driving too fast. ‘What do your parents think about what you do? Do you tell them, “I stalk people for a living”?’ the singer asked.

The incident held up traffic in Hollywood. Before speeding off, Bieber said, ‘You guys love this, don’t you?’
