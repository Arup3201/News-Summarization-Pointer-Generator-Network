Some say there's nothing worse than when someone bumps into you and spills your beer. Well, on Saturday night, Brooklyn Nets' Mason Plumlee took it to another level.

The 6ft 9in basketball player knocked into waitress, Deila Barr, as he chased the ball during his team's heavy defeat by the Washington Wizards.

The unlucky waitress spilled a tray full of beers over spectators and caused a disruption as cleaners had to mop up after the mishap.

Those courtside pay extra to be the closer to the action and, unluckily for them, got more than they bargained for at the Verizon Centre.

Plumlee didn't look happy about it either, though he won't be the one going home reeking of beer. 

Sadly for the Nets that was the most lively thing they did on court all evening as they suffered a 114-77 defeat in the capital.

The Wizards led by 30 by the end of the third quarter as they convincingly ended a five-game losing streak, with thanks to John Wall's 17 points and Rasual Butler's 15.

'It's not so much you're in a rut and not playing the way that we're capable of. That's going to happen,' Washington coach Randy Wittman said afterwards.' It's reacting and how you get out of it. 

'Throughout a couple of games in this stretch, we were kind of hoping we'd go out and win a game. We need to win a game instead of going out and taking it and being aggressive.'
