Seeking offers over £295,000 for a remote two-bedroom house was certain to raise eyebrows in today’s sluggish property market.

The sellers might have expected to sell their ‘pleasant but unremarkable’ Highland hideaway for a few thousand pounds over the odds. 

But then Eddrachilles House has a value-added element – the most dramatic panoramic views in the whole of Britain.

Room with a view: The bungalow, 20 miles south of Cape Wrath, overlooks Badcall Bay and charmed one buyer into shelling out £530,000

Stunning: The single storey house in the north west Highlands' view was what drew buyers to the property

And that has persuaded one extremely ‘determined’ house hunter to offer 80 per cent over the asking price.

The sale price of just over £530,000 for a modern, single-storey property valued at £300,000 is unlikely to provoke a housing boom in the north-west.

But, according to experts, it has sent a ‘frisson of excitement and hope’ through the market.

Eddrachilles House is situated at the heart of a crofting community in Sutherland, lying 20 miles south of Cape Wrath, the most north-westerly point on the British mainland, in an area described by all who know it as ‘magical’.

The house is not large – it has two reception rooms, a conservatory and two bedrooms which are en suite.

Flurry of offers: The house was put on the market by Strutt & Parker, who recorded an 'immediate surge of interest'

Must-have property: The highest bid was from a buyer who was 'simply determined' not to be outbid, the estate agent said, and missives were concluded at the weekend

Stunning: The house sits in 100 acres on an elevated situation over Badcall Bay (pictured), with breathtaking views over sea and mountain from every window

The nearest village is Scourie, two miles away, which has a shop, a petrol station, a GP’s surgery and a primary school.

Ullapool is 41 miles down the twisting but wonderfully scenic A894.

‘Civilisation’, in the form of the nearest Marks & Spencer, is 100 miles away in Inverness.

The house sits in 100 acres on an 
elevated situation over Badcall Bay, with breathtaking views over sea 
and mountain from every window. It also boasts its own slipway and 
mooring.

Impressive: A persistent buyer was 'simply determined' not to be outbid and raised his offer far beyond the asking price

Modest, but mighty: The house is not large - it has two reception rooms, a conservatory and two bedrooms which are en suite

The house was put on the market by Strutt & Parker, who recorded an ‘immediate surge of interest’. A closing date was set within two weeks.

A spokesman for the firm confessed to being ‘staggered’ when they opened the seven bids and discovered all were above the £300,000 Home Report valuation.

The highest was from a buyer who was ‘simply determined’ not to be outbid, said a spokesman, and missives were concluded at the weekend.

In the Inverness office of Strutt & Parker, Kevin Maley said: ‘This is a place to stir the imagination. Its launch attracted a fantastic response. However, nothing would have prepared us for the successful offer. 

‘While this sale is not symptomatic of the market, it does prove that there is momentum in the market and that certain properties can set it alight.’
