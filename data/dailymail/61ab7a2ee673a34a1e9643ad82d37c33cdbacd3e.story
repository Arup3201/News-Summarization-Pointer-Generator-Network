Paris Saint-Germain's interest in Yaya Toure is expected to be given short thrift by Manchester City.

The French are looking at strong midfielders who can help them dominate sides in the Champions League and are keen on City’s free scoring talisman.

Toure admitted in January that he would like to play for PSG one day but City intend to make sure that is not for a few years yet.

Hot property: Toure is not likely to leave Manchester City this summer

They are eager to make Toure, Sergio Aguero and Vincent Kompany remain at Eastlands as part of their own plans to dominate the Champions League next season.

With a faltering finish to the season they will look to add a further four players in the summer with West Ham target Joleon Lescott and Micah Richards both leaving.

 

Bayern Munich are showing an interest in Aston Villa prospect Easah Suliman.

The 16-year-old defender has captained England at U17 level and impressed Bayern’s scouts playing for Villa in the FA Youth Cup.

Suliman, who is from Hall Green, has been with Villa since he was eight years old and was spotted playing in a tournament at Butlins.

He turns 17 in January and has shown versatility playing at left-back as well as centre-back.

Bayern are continuing to scour England for upcoming talent as they did with Tranmere protégé Dale Jennings. The Liverpool-born youngster failed to settle though and has since returned to England with Championship Barnsley.

 

West Ham manager Sam Allardyce admitted he enjoyed the sausages on his recent scouting trip to Germany, however, the trip home wasn’t so successful.

Allardyce was at Wolfsburg against Nuremberg to watch Swiss striker Josip Drmic play for the visitors. The 21-year-old struggled to impress against a dominant Wolfsburg and the day got worse for Allardyce on his way back to the airport when his hire car broke down and he had to get out to help his driver push the car to the side of the road.

Fortunately for ‘Big Sam’ an Everton scout, who had also been to the game, was passing and stopped to give him a lift to the airport.

Allardyce gave little away saying: ‘I was at Nuremburg versus Wolfsburg. The sausages were great! They ot beat quite comfortably so in terms of that player you wouldn’t be able to judge him on that particular game because they got battered.’

Drmic has scored 16 goals this season and is understood to have a release clause of £5million should his side, who sit second from bottom, be relegated.

Arsenal, Everton and Liverpool have also checked on him.

 

Aston Villa and Everton have expressed interest in West Bromwich Albion loan star Morgan Amalfitano.

The 29-year-old is loan from Marseille but West Bromwich Albion have missed the cut-off date to make his move permanent. Marseille are willing to sell for £2.5million and Hull City have also expressed an interest.

Amalfitano has caught the eye with his performances this season and his ability to play in a number of positions across the midfield.

His goal contribution has also helped, notably his individual effort against Manchester United at Old Trafford early in the season.

Villa, meanwhile, are also among clubs monitoring Watford striker Troy Deeney with Niklas Helenius expected to return to Alborg in the summer.

 

Blackburn Rovers are considering a move for PFA Scottish Championship Player of the Year contender Kane Hemmings.

The young striker has put his career back on track after leaving Rangers following a spate of knee injuries as a youngster.

He has been a star turn for Cowdenbeath and has scored 19 goals in 32 games. Apart from Blackburn, Dundee, Hibernian and Kilmarnock are all keen on English-born Hemmings who will be out of contract in the summer.

English suitors for Andre-Pierre Gignac are expected to be disappointed this summer. The France international centre forward has been courted by West Ham, Stoke and Everton in recent seasons and Marseille are ready to sell with just one year remaining on his contract.

However, the 28-year-old’s wages of around £75,000 a week mean he is heading to Moscow with Dinamo and Spartak both interested.

Hit man: Several English clubs may be in for Marseille striker Andre-Pierre Gignac
