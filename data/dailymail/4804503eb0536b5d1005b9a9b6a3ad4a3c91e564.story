One of the 20th century's great broadcasters suffered a very 21st century gaffe on election night when his smart phone went off in the middle of a live broadcast on MSNBC.

Tom Brokaw, who was anchor of NBC Nightly News for more than two decades, was offering up analysis of Senator Mitch McConnell's reelection victory in Kentucky when his phone began blaring a 'red alert' alarm. 

'Could that be me?' he asked and reached for his pocket.

Oops! Tom Brokaw's phone suddenly started blaring during election night coverage live on MSNBC on Tuesday

The veteran broadcaster played off the gaff by raising the phone to his ear and pretending his wife called to remind him to pick up milk on his way home

The 74-year-old sheepishly pulled out his noisy mobile device and switched it off. 

'I thought you were a fire' quipped co-host Rachel Maddow. 

The veteran broadcaster quickly played off his mistake, putting his phone to his ear and joking that it was his wife who was calling. 

'Yes I will remember to bring home the milk, don't worry about it. And I'll feed the dog in the morning. Just sleep in, it's gonna be OK,' he cracked. 

Brokaw was anchor of NBC Nightly News from 1982 until 2004. He has stayed on at the network as a special correspondent, including co-hosting duties on election nights.
