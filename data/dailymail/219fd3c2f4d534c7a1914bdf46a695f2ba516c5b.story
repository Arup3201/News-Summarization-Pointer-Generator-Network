The first significant cracks in morale among Hull’s long-serving players have become evident after veteran defender Paul McShane used Twitter to announce his mystery demotion to training with the under 21s.

The 28-year-old Republic of Ireland international, at Hull for six years, tweeted on Friday as his club prepared to face Swansea. They subsequently lost the match via a deflected goal that took a final touch from Ki Sung-yueng.

Then when Hull manager Steve Bruce learned of McShane’s outburst, he said: ‘I could go to Twitter and tell you but maybe Paul can enlighten you why he’s with the under 21s. I’ll never go to the media or to Twitter on things which remain in-house.’

McShane sent this tweet on Friday revealing his demotion to training with the under 21 side

HULL — Peace and goodwill to return to the squad, and goals. 

SWANSEA — Deputies for Bony and Ki (11 out of 22 goals scored this season), both absent in January.

McShane spoke earlier this season about his disappointment at being axed and on Friday re-tweeted messages from fans unhappy that he could be leaving.

Without a win in 10 league games, Bruce has already been forced to deny a bust-up with on-loan Hatem Ben Arfa.

Hull defender James Chester said Bruce had ‘given us a kick up the backside. It’s up to us to improve’.
