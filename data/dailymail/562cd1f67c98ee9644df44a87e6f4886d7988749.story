Air passengers lying about their health has rendered airport screening for diseases including Ebola ineffective, with around half of infected travellers missed.

Concerns over being delayed drives passengers to withhold the full truth over their risk of exposure, experts warned today.

A team of scientists from California and London examined screening processes for six different viruses.

They were Ebola, SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS), Marburg virus, swine flu and avian flu. 

The team said questionnaires are the most effective detection method when a disease is in its early stages, and sufferers are not showing any signs of symptoms.

A new study has found arrival screening for diseases including Ebola, like that taking place at Heathrow Airport, above, is more effective than departure checks, because symptoms can develop during travel

Scientists in California and London said infrared temperature checks, pictured above at the airport in Lagos, Nigeria, at best, only detect fevers 70 per cent of the time

But they admitted that at best, just 25 per cent of people honestly reported their exposure to flu during the 2009 swine flu pandemic, while others hid symptoms by taking medication.  

They found checking the temperatures of passengers suspected as being at risk of exposure to diseases like Ebola and the related Marburg virus is 'particularly ineffective'.

The scientists said the long incubation periods of the two illnesses - in Ebola the incubation period is two to 21 days, while it's three to nine days for Marburg virus - renders the policy useless.

But, they noted, the practice does prove beneficial when trying to detect cases of other diseases including swine flu, that has a shorter incubation period.

The study found questionnaires, such as this one from Public Health England, are most effective when diseases are in their early stages 

Katelyn Gostic, from the University of California, said: 'We found that for diseases with a long incubation period such as Marburg and Ebola, taking passengers’ temperature to test for fever is particularly ineffective at the start of an epidemic but does pick up more cases as it stabilises. 

'With diseases such as swine flu that take a shorter time to incubate, fever screening is the most effective method throughout an epidemic,' she added.

Fever screening at arrival destinations has been criticised for being ineffective.

But the researchers suggest it might prove more effective than those programmes that rely on screening passengers as they leave a country.

The study notes some symptoms of diseases will progress during a journey, making it easier to detect on arrival.

And they warn, at best, infrared non-contact thermometers will only ever detect fevers 70 per cent of the time. 

Dr Gostic, said: 'Honest reporting can not only improve on-site detection but is essential to enable authorities to follow up with travellers who may have been exposed but have not yet developed symptoms.

'We need to find ways to incentivise better self-reporting.' 

The study suggests resources could be better spent on arrival screening, or on tracing and containing potential cases that appear through airport questionnaires. 

The research carried out at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine will be published in the journal eLife.
