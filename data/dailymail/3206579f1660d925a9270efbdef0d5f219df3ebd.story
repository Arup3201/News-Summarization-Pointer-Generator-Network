Archbishop Welby has urged MPs to consider the consequences of military intervention in Syria

The Archbishop of Canterbury has warned MPs not to rush in their decision on whether to vote for military intervention in the Syria conflict.

Ahead of Thursday's early return to Parliament, The Most Rev Justin Welby said he feared the possible consequences of intervention saying they were 'beyond description and horrible'.

He said: 'The things which MPs will have to bear in mind in what is going to be a very, very difficult debate is firstly: are we sure about the facts on the ground?

'Secondly: Is it possible to have a 
carefully calibrated response including armed force, if you are sure 
about the facts on the ground, that does not have unforeseeable 
ramifications across the whole Arab and Muslim world?

'I
have had a lot of conversations with people in the region. I think the 
overwhelming sense is of a really moving and terrible sense of fear 
about what might come out of, what might be happening in the next few 
weeks - not predicated on people doing one thing or people doing 
another, just a sense that this a terribly, terribly dangerous time,' he
told the Daily Telegraph.

Archbishop Welby, who visited the region in June, said the situation had deteriorated since his visit.

He
said 'I think it has got worse since then. I can scarcely remember a 
time of being in meetings where there was such a sense of apprehension.

'I
mean it was tangible, this sense of "What will happen? What will be the
impact on us?"....the impact on people not directly involved in the 
fighting is beyond description and horrible'.

He added: 'I am extremely conscious 
of my own lack of knowledge having spent a lot of time in the area over 
the years very much in the reconciliation area, so dealing with the 
people involved in these things.

'I am deeply, deeply aware of the enormous complexity and inter-linkedness of everything that happens there.'

He
acknowledged, however, that the Government was better informed than he,
making clear that he had no sense that politicians were 'slavering' to 
'unleash the dogs of war'.
