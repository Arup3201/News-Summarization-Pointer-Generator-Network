The cost of the controversial High Speed 2 rail line could reach £73billion, senior Treasury officials have warned ministers.

In a sign of the growing opposition to the project within parts of the Treasury, officials have stopped using the latest £42.6billion estimate in favour of the higher figure.

Some believe the cost of the flagship project is out of control and are warning that it cannot be justified.

Controversial: The cost of the high-speed rail line HS2 is likely to be near £73billion, say Treasury officials

A source close to George Osborne insisted that the Coalition remained fully committed to the project to build a high speed line between London, Birmingham and the north of England.

The source said the Chancellor believed HS2 was a ‘crucial project for our future prosperity and growth’ and was determined to overrule Treasury scepticism.

The source suggested some elements in the Treasury had an ingrained opposition to major infrastructure projects.

But the revelation that parts of the Treasury are actively lobbying against the scheme will reinforce doubts about whether it will go ahead.

The official budget has already 
rocketed from £30billion in 2010 to £42.6billion. Now, in a break with 
normal practice, Treasury officials are adding VAT and inflation to 
produce £73billion.

One 
official told the Financial Times that this figure – 70 per cent higher 
than the official estimate – was being used deliberately to encourage 
opposition to the scheme within government.

Investment: The revelation that Treasury insiders are against HS2 will reinforce doubts over whether it will go ahead

Some Treasury insiders believe the money would be better spent on smaller projects which could deliver more economic growth more quickly.

Many independent experts believe the HS2 bill will be even higher. The Institute for Economic Affairs estimates that it could reach £80billion.

There are also signs that the cross-party consensus behind the scheme is beginning to crumble. Former business secretary Lord Mandelson, once an enthusiastic advocate, warned last month that it could prove an ‘expensive mistake’.

Matthew Sinclair, of the TaxPayers’ Alliance campaign group, welcomed Treasury opposition to the scheme and called for it to be axed.

He said: ‘The economic case for HS2 simply isn’t credible and it’s ridiculous that ministers aren’t being honest about the cost of this white elephant.’
