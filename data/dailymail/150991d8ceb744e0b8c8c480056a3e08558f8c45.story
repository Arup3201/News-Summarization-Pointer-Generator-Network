A picture postcard village is in 'absolute total uproar' after a council closed a ford where a well known judge was drowned in a horrific accident.

Concrete barriers were put up by Hampshire County Council 'right across the ford' at Headley, Hampshire, the day after the inquest was held into the death of Judge Jonathan Gammon.

But yesterday furious small holder Simon Hiscock said farmers were being forced to take a two mile detour with their vehicles as a result of the controversial closure.

As a result he said motorists were being held up by agricultural vehicles on main roads.

Mr Hiscock said: 'This has caused absolute total uproar in the village. Farmers are being forced to make a two mile detour. We all have to trot around the roads holding the motorists up.'

Yesterday Ashford Hill with Headley Parish Council demanded urgent talks with Hampshire County Council on the future of the barriers.

Inquest: Jonathan Gammon died alongside his pet dog after his Toyota Yaris was overcome by water

Parish Council chairman Barrie Hiscock, 76 - who stressed the matter would be at the top of their agenda at its next meeting later in the month - said: 'Putting the concrete barriers there is a knee jerk reaction.

'It was a terrible tragedy the judge being killed - but this is the only tragedy at the ford in living memory.

'If there are accidents on a road you do not shut the road - so because this man was tragically drowned you do not close the ford.

'It is an access for vital agricultural machinery - even cattle are driven through there. We want urgent consultations with the county council on the future of these barriers.

'We do not want to be left out of the loop - people making a decision in county offices that have no understanding of the rural aspect of it. We are a rural community and have a rural outlook on it.'

Judge Gammon was drowned in April when the car in which he was a passenger was swept away by the swollen River Enborne.

He died alongside his pet dog Gabby after his Toyota Yaris was overcome by water and swept more than 100 metres downstream.

His wife Priscilla Turner had been driving her husband to work when the satellite navigation system sent her into a swollen ford.

She managed to 
escape and when she was helped out of the river she told her rescuer: 
‘I’ve killed my husband’.

Mr Gammon, 52, worked as a mental 
health tribunal judge and the couple were travelling to the Thornfield 
Park Hospital, a secure hospital for men detained under the mental 
health act.

Temporary warning signs were then put
up after the accident but they were ignored by motorists. Then the 
concrete barriers were put up after the inquest last week.

Councillor Mel Kendal who is Deputy Leader and Executive Member for Environment and Transport on Hampshire County council said to maintain the temporary closure the council had installed the concrete barriers.

'Following the conclusion of the inquest last week work will now be completed on the options for the future and a final decision will be taken later this year following further local consultation and consideration of all the relevant issues.'
