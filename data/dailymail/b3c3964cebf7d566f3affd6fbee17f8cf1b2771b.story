An NHS trust has admitted responsibility for the death of a young mother who killed herself in a hospital room while suffering from severe post-natal depression.

Diana Mager 'would be alive today if she had received proper care', her widower Adam said after the climbdown by Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust.

Officials initially insisted that Mrs Mager's death 'could not have been predicted or prevented' despite the fact that she had already made a number of suicide attempts.

Tragic: Diana Mager killed herself in a hospital room in August last year while suffering post-natal depression

However, following a legal challenge from the bereaved family, the trust backtracked and admitted that in fact the tragedy could have been avoided.

Mrs Mager, 33, committed suicide in August last year while being treated at Green Parks House psychiatric unit in Orpington, Kent.

She had been suffering severe post-natal depression since giving birth to her daughter Sofia in November 2011, and was self-harming.

Mrs Mager had previously been allowed out of the unit for short periods, during which time she went to the Tate Modern and tried to jump from roof.

On another occasion, she smuggled a knife into her room, leading Mr Mager to argue that she should be put under continuous observation.

However, at the time of her death she was being checked by nurses only every 15 minutes - despite a note on her medical records stating that she was 'at very high risk of killing herself'.

Oxleas Trust said earlier this year that there was nothing they could have done to prevent Mrs Mager's death.

But when Mr Mager launched a legal challenge against the trust, they admitted that they could have stopped her killing herself.

Mr Mager, 39, said the admission vindicated his campaign for justice for his wife.

'I always believed that Diana would be alive today if she had received the proper care she desperately needed,' he said. 'Instead, I have to explain to our daughter why her mother is no longer with us.'

A spokesman for the trust said: 'At Oxleas NHS Foundation Trust we are very sorry and deeply saddened by Mrs Mager's death, and would once again like to offer our sincere condolences to her husband and family.

'We undertook an internal investigation following Mrs Mager's death, which identified some learning for us. We take the death of a patient very seriously and have since taken further expert advice.

'Following this, we will now review our internal inquiry to identify further learning and ensure that this is put in place. Patient care is our top priority and we want to be open with our patients and their families.'

Mr Mager's lawyer Mark Bowman, a medical negligence specialist at London firm Field Fisher Waterhouse, said: 'I am pleased to see that liability has finally been admitted by the trust in this matter.

'I am however concerned that the admission comes after the trust had initially claimed, following a full and through investigation, that Diana's death could not have been predicted or prevented.

'There needs to be far greater transparency and honesty in mental health care in this country if the public are to have confidence in the system.'
