These disgusting pictures show the revolting state of a kitchen at a £45-a-night, three-star hotel, where surfaces were smeared with grease and fridges were piled high with unwrapped raw meat.

The Great Western Hotel, in Swindon, was prosecuted for a dozen separate breaches of food hygiene rules after inspectors found the kitchen in this shocking state last year.

Cooked food was being stored with unwrapped raw chicken and bacon, while preparation areas were soiled, smeared with grease and encrusted with old food.

Customers at the hotel's restaurant were at risk of food poisoning because ingredients were kept at the wrong temperatures, Swindon Magistrates' Court heard.

Pictures from inside the kitchen show juices from meat-filled containers almost spilling over on to other food.

The hotel was also found to be selling out-of-date sandwiches. 

The inspection last March came after Swindon Council's food safety department ordered the hotel to improve its food hygiene.

The hotel, which serves pub grub ranging from burgers to fish and chips, costs £45 a night for a double room, including breakfast.

The hotel's director Gavin McKelvie and manager Mark Wylie were fined a total of £20,100 and ordered to pay £7,500 costs after admitting to all 12 breaches.

The court was told that the business had since introduced new procedures to train staff and that £30,000 had been spent on improvements to the kitchen. 

A spokesman for the Swindon Borough Council food safety team said: 'This is one of the worst cases we have seen for some time. 

'The owners of the business had no explanation when we asked them as to why they had let the kitchen get into such a condition, and the pictures speak for themselves.

'We only prosecute where efforts to persuade a business to improve have failed, and in this case we had absolutely no choice but to take court action. We now hope that in future standards will be significantly better and we will be monitoring the premises closely.'

McKelvie said: 'We very much regret the situation we found ourselves in a year ago. However, we very quickly put things right and have moved on significantly further since then.

'The hotel, bar-restaurant and kitchen are now totally transformed and trade is good, with many customers coming back time and again.'
