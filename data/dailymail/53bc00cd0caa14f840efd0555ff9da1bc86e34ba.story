A North Carolina race that encourages young women to dress like sexy schoolgirls was canceled by organizers, citing 'community controversy.'

Sexy Schoolgirl 5K race organizers told Raleigh city officials on Thursday they were canceling the race.

Young women dressed as sexy schoolgirls are seen in several images on the group's social media pages. The photos include captions like 'I don't sweat, I sparkle' and 'Friends don't let friends run sexy alone.'

The group's website encourages participants to 'pull up those knee socks, strap on those suspenders, and come join the fun!'

The coed races, which do not have a strict dress code, are also normally followed by a pub crawl. Race participants must be 18 and older.

Former Raleigh police captain Paula O'Neal criticized the race to town council members.

O'Neal said 'I question the message that is being sent and endorsed by the City of Raleigh due to the increasing problem of rape and violence against girls in the schools and on college campuses,' The News & Observer of Raleigh reports.

Other factors in the race's cancellation include 'a lack of early sign-ups and inadequate organization,' the paper said.

The group's website says it partnered 
with the MATHCOUNTS Foundation, which offers mathematics programs and 
competitions for middle schoolers.

MATHCOUNTS, however, said in a statement that it distanced itself from the Sexy Schoolgirl 5K race after it was 'made aware of some of the materials that were designed by the race organizers to promote the race.'

'MATHCOUNTS has informed the race organizers that we do not want to be associated with this event, and that they should remove all reference to MATHCOUNTS from their website and marketing materials,' the organization said. 'Furthermore, we have informed them that we will not accept any donations made from the proceeds of this race.

'At this point,
multiple attempts to contact race organizers by MATHCOUNTS have been unanswered
and they continue to list us on their materials despite our formal request to
have it removed.'

Bonner Gaylord, a member of the Raleigh city council, commended the race's cancellation on Twitter.

'Congratulations #Raleigh... We are officially NOT having a Sexy Schoolgirl 5k,' he wrote.

Mary-Ann Baldwin, another council member, told MailOnline she was 'relieved' the race was cancelled.

'I didn't want to get in a war over this,' she said in an email exchange. 'You want to give people the freedom to express themselves and have fun. But I felt this went overboard. It sends the wrong message to young women and devalues them.

'The organizers did the right thing in canceling. But I hope they also do the right thing and run races for charity that are more inspired and respectful.'

The group's website says races are planned for Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Virginia Beach, Virginia, and Tampa Bay, Florida.
