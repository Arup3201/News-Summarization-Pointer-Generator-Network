You wouldn’t believe it was the same time of year… As Britain endures its coldest March since 1963, it’s hard to think that just 12 months ago we were basking in the sunniest March since 1929.

As our pictures show, then sunseekers flocked to beaches, and even northern Scotland enjoyed temperatures exceeding 22C.

Yesterday it peaked at 2C amid the snow. Whatever will the climate deal us next?

Meanwhile health chiefs have declared winter officially over – just as millions shiver through the bitter cold snap.

The Department of Health said on Friday it was shutting down its Winterwatch health-monitoring service ‘because spring is on its way’.

As the country was battered by snowstorms, floods and freezing temperatures, the department ended its regular updates on how to cope in winter and its  flu-monitoring service.

‘Winterwatch was scheduled  to end at this time,’ said a spokesman. ‘It’s down to the calendar, not based on the weather, though I’m not sure we expected it to be as cold as this.’

The department’s cold weather plan 
for the NHS is still in force. This provides advice to hospitals and 
doctors on how to prepare and respond to severe weather.

The Army has also decreed summer has 
arrived. Guardsmen were ordered to swap their greatcoats for red tunics 
at Buckingham Palace and St James’s Palace yesterday. And Household 
Cavalry troopers switched to a shorter cape.

Lieutenant
Colonel Dino Bossi, of the Welsh Guards, said: ‘The soldiers have spent
the winter enduring some pretty bad conditions out there and I hope the
weather gods welcome the added splash of colour and smile on us.’

Despite winter having officially ended bookies have slashed their odds on a white Easter.

A record number of bets have been taken in the past  48 hours on snow 
falling next weekend, forcing one firm, Ladbrokes, to cut their odds to 
4/5.

‘We’ve never seen so many bets on a white Easter,’ said Ladbrokes’ Alex Donohue. 

‘People up and down the land are banking on the snowfall continuing into next weekend.’

The firm has also halved the odds on the Queen wearing snowshoes to the 
traditional Easter Sunday service at Windsor to 50/1, with snow in May 
at 33/1 and June/July at 66/1.

The relentless bad weather has caused the national mood to plummet, according to experts.

Some 55,000 people rated their state of happiness between 0 and 100, as well as what they were doing, on an iPhone app called Mappiness.

The app then correlated the data with the weather at the user’s location. Researchers from the London School of Economics and University College London found that cold, wet weather in Britain has a measurable effect on the population’s mood.

Rain, on average, lowers people’s happiness by 1.4 points, while a lack of sunshine cuts it by another half point. High winds lower it by a further one point.

Dr George MacKerron, one of the project’s designers, said: ‘We certainly find significant weather effects. Given that people don’t have  control of the weather, we’re pretty sure this  is a causal relationship.’

As a result of our wintry blues many of us are seeking out warming comfort food, according to sales figures from supermarkets.

M&S has seen soup sales rise by 70 per cent, while warming roast 
joints are up 32 per cent compared with last year’s warmer March. Sales of hot puddings were also up ten per cent.

A spokesman said: ‘The weather always has a big impact on what our customers choose to eat.

‘When it’s cold outside they like to warm up with hot lunches and hearty dinners. On a cold night nothing beats a good stew or an apple pie with custard.’

Waitrose said shoppers were also trying to avoid the ravages of the 
unseasonal weather by eating healthily, with apple and pear sales up by 
28 per cent, citrus fruit up 20 per cent and stone fruit  up 26 per 
cent.

Avocado sales have also jumped by a quarter.
