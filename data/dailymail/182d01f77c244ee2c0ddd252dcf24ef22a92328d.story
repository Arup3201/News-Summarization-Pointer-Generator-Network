Gordon Brown's closest aides prepared him for the Prime Minister's job by hurling abuse like 'Sod off you Scottish Git' at him, it was revealed today.

His former special adviser Damian McBride said he and other colleagues would scream insults to 'get under the skin' of the former Labour leader, who would shout back the mantra 'I will do my utmost'.

Mr Brown took the abuse in his office as he readied himself to replace Tony Blair on June 27, 2007.

In a blog posted today, exactly five years after Mr Brown entered Number 10 Downing Street, Mr McBride wrote that these heckles were designed to reproduce what he would face in the top job.

Protesters were hanging outside Downing Street calling Mr Blair a war criminal as he left office, he said, so Mr Brown also needed to be prepared for receiving the most upsetting remarks.

'It’s not often you’re paid to hurl abuse at someone who’s about to become the most powerful man in the country, but that’s how the day started,' he said.

'Given Iraq war protestors were already gathering at the Downing Street gates to see off Tony Blair, we suggested he do a few run-throughs with us heckling him so he could get used to the distraction he’d experience later.

'I did always wonder what any Treasury officials passing outside the room would have thought hearing Gordon booming out: "I will do my utmost" while I shouted back at him: "Sod off, you Scottish Git!"

'Sue’s (Nye, fellow adviser) heckles were from the Father Ted school ("Booo!", "Hiss!", "You’re a very bad man!", etc.), but I tried to get in the spirit a bit more: 'Blood on your hands, Brown!', You’re a murderer, Brown!'

'Every so often, I’d shout something that would get under his skin, and he’d stop his speech and just give me a long, deathly stare. I’d protest: “Well you can’t do that if someone says it in the street”, which got me another stare,' he wrote.

The blog gives a fascinating insight into what happened on that historic day.

But Downing Street Press adviser Mr McBride was later forced to resign 
after a series of emails he sent from No10 to fellow Labour spin doctor 
Derek Draper.

Battle: Mr McBride's blog also reveals that Mr Brown wanted to scrap tuition fees but feared reprisals from Blair's supporters

In the emails, Mr McBride, one of the Prime Minister’s most loyal and
 trusted advisers, reportedly made ‘vile’ and false allegations against 
Mr Osborne and Mr Cameron concerning their private lives.

Mr McBride's piece also details how hard Mr Brown tried to get Tony Blair's staff to work for him, which Mr McBride described as 'humiliating'.

It also revealed that he would have scrapped tuition fees but feared a backlash from Tony Blair's supporters.

'If he’d succeeded,' McBride said, 'it would have strengthened his hand to make major departures from Blair policies in his early days.

'Proposals such as scrapping tuition fees which had been high on the list of planned announcements were shelved because Gordon didn’t feel secure enough against a Blairite backlash.'

And his fate was sealed because he did not take across enough staff from his Chancellor's office in the Treasury, he said.

'In No. 10, he inherited equally-brilliant, equally-expert civil servants, but – because there was not the same level of trust and confidence on his side, and the same knowledge of how best to work with him on theirs – the micro-manager within Gordon re-surfaced,' he said.
