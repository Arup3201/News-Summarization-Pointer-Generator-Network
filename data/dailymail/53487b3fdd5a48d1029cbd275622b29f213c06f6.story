A woman who lived and worked near Pittsburgh is among the 239 people aboard a Malaysia Airlines jet that disappeared en route to Beijing over the weekend, her employer said Monday.

Mei Ling Chng, a Malaysian national, was a senior process engineer for Eastman Chemical subsidiary Flexsys America in Monongahela, near Pittsburgh, her employer confirmed. Co-workers 'are deeply shocked and saddened' a spokesperson said.

Her devastated uncle, from Kuala Lumpur, was at the airport in the Malaysian capital after the tragedy was announced to demand answers about his niece's disappearance.

Her uncle was heard shouting Saturday in the Malaysian capital's airport, according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

'Be truthful about this,' Koon Chim Wa yelled with his hands trembling and his body shaking. 'They say they don't know where the plane is, is this a joke?'

Chng was flying back to the US, he told the paper.

'As you can imagine, this has been a very shocking and sad situation and our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of all aboard the missing flight and in particular to those of our co-worker,' said Eastman spokesperson Tracey Kilgore.

'We are still trying to pull together details, and also, out of respect to her family, we are not in a position to release personal information about her.'

It is not clear how old Chng is, but may be in her early to mid 30's based on her LinkedIn profile saying she graduated from college in 2004.

The native Malaysian joined the company in 2009, also according to her LinkedIn profile, and had just purchased a home in the Pittsburgh suburbs last October.

Chng made a strong impression on Valerie Shafer, the seller.

'She was a very intelligent young lady. I was quite impressed with her,' said Shafer, adding that 'I remember holding Chng up to my daughter' as an example of how education and hard work could enable a single young woman to buy a house.

Shafer, who works in human resources, said she stayed in touch with Chng after the sale via email and even checked on packages that were left at the house when the woman was away.

'She was just a very accomplished young woman. I'm just devastated to hear she was on that flight.'

Chng had 'a very nice smile,' she added.

Little person details have been released about Chng outside of Kilgore saying she was 'remembered fondly by her co-workers as being ... pleasant and happy as well as well-respected.'

The missing woman's work focused on chemical process optimization and new process development. Flexsys makes and supplies chemicals for the rubber industry.
