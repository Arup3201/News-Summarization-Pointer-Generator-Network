Australia and Israel are the latest countries to legislate against so-called 'revenge porn'.

Both nations have passed laws that specifically make the sharing of intimate imagery, texts or videos of an ex-partner with the intent to cause harm or distress illegal.

They are the latest governments to address the worryingly common phenomenon, which sees previous partners or lovers maliciously post private intimate content online to shame or embarrass their ex.

In Israel the law was introduced to the Knesset by member Yifat Kariv who said: 'We are witnessing more and more cases of sexual assaults that were filmed and distributed in public without restraint and without limits; this legislative intervention is necessary and will help fight the shocking phenomenon of 'virtual rape,' Time.com reports.

Meanwhile the Australian state of Victoria has made it an offence to distribute, or even threaten to distribute such images.

Revenge porn often sees the victim named, with personal information such as place of work, parents phone number or boss's email, being shared alongside the photo and vile hateful messages from their ex.

Victims are often horrified to learn that, as well as the humiliation of highly personal information, meant for their partner's eyes only, being splashed online, that they will likely struggle to bring the perpetrator to justice, or even to get the images taken down.

There are also reports of a victim's 
photo being obtained through their own, or their ex's computer being 
hacked rather than being submitted, or even of a victim's face being 
Photoshopped onto pornographic images, when they have never been 
photographed nude.

England
 currently has no law to explicitly make posting revenge porn illegal, 
though a charge may still be brought under existing harassment laws or 
other communications laws.

In part, the worldwide lack of proper guidelines and laws is due to the difficultly faced in drawing legal boundaries.

If the partner took the footage or image then the copyright is theirs, and a website is not responsible for content given by others unless it is child pornography.

Many revenge porn sites appallingly cash in on the lack of policing and will charge victims to take their photos down.

In California, where some anti-revenge porn legislation has been passed (the law does not cover any material taken by the subject themselves such as 'selfies') a website owner has just been arrested after extorting his victims out of thousands of dollars.

Kevin Bollaert has been charged with 31 offences pertaining to the publishing of 10,000 explicit photos that were sent in to a revenge porn website he ran.

And while it may be easy to dismiss revenge porn as a side-line issue, research from the University of Indiana recently showed that more than half (52.3 per cent) of young adults have engaged in 'unwanted but consensual sexting with a committed partner.'

By this they mean that while the person was not forced to send the text or image, they felt pressurised into it, perhaps by peer pressure or anxieties over the relationship, with women being more susceptible than men.

A few victims have raised the profile of the issue such as Dr. Holly Jacobs whose ex's campaign resulted in her having to change her name before becoming an activist against revenge porn.

Revenge porn sites have come under legal scrutiny as more and more disgruntled exes decide to publicly share intimate photos of former lovers in an effort to shame them.

Law enforcement officials have been stumped on how to respond to revenge porn.

Website operators aren't liable for content provided by others, unless the images are child pornography.

Anti-harassment and cyberstalking laws don't apply unless the ex-partner threatens the victim or attempts repeated contact.

Copyright protections wouldn't help because often the victim wasn't the one who took the photos.

Suing for civil damages is another option, but that, means hefty legal bills and the risk of provoking an unstable ex-partner.

California and New Jersey passed specific laws criminalizing revenge porn - while others including Maryland are considering a change in legislation.

In California spurned lovers who post graphic images of ex face prison sentence while those convicted of malicious intent could also be fined $1,000.

Australia and Israel are the latest countries to pass laws.
