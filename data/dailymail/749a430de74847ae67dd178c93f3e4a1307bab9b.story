A woman paralyzed from the neck down and her able-bodied husband have opened up about their loving 31-year marriage that has withstood bouts of depression and most recently, breast cancer.

Joni Eareckson from Agoura Hill, California, who has been wheelchair-bound since the age of 17, joked that she knew Ken Tada was the one when he willingly changed her urine bag on the first date.

Recalling the incident, she told True Woman: 'As Ken was emptying my bag on [a] tree . . . he started humming this little ditty: "Where Joni goes, nothing grows." Right away, I thought, Here is a man I could like. [He] had a real sense of humor about my disability.'

Mr Tada, 66, said that he also felt instant attraction. He told the Christian Post: 'I have to say I had dated some women in the past, I mean prior to meeting Joni. Joni was different. There was a deepness to our conversations that I can't explain.

'It just was there and I fell in love with her: her outward appearance, but her interior beauty was well.'

After a whirlwind courtship the couple tied the knot in 1982 and a special ramp was built in the church enabling Mrs Eareckson Tada to get up to the alter.

But not everything has been rosy since, however, and in their new memoir, Joni & Ken: An Untold Love Story the couple detail some of the darker moments.

Indeed, Mr Tada explains that a year into married life he realized that being a full-time carer while working as a high school history teacher was exhausting and mentally challenging.

At home he had to remove his wife's make-up, help her with routine toileting and turn her in bed at night because she couldn't do it for herself. He also had to cook, clean and do the all of the shopping.

'I fell in love with her: her outward appearance, but her interior beauty was well'

'I still loved Joni, but one night I sat
 down on the bed and just said, "Joni, I'm feeling trapped. I'm feeling 
like all of this is just coming down on my shoulders here,"' he told the
 Christian Post.

Mrs Eareckson Tada, 63, said that she was angry at first, but understood why he felt 'trapped'. 

'I knew when Ken said that he wasn't saying that he didn't like me, that he no longer found me appealing or it was that he didn't want to be with me,' she said. 'It's just the circumstances connected with my disability were so overwhelming.

'I lived in this wheelchair . . . and I know what it feels like to be overwhelmed by this disability. I know what it feels like to just want to disappear, to feel trapped.'

Split-second decision: On July 30, 1967, Ms Eareckson Tada dived headfirst into Chesapeake Bay in Maryland but misjudged the water depth and severed her spinal cord

They worked things through and agreed to get additional help. As a teenager, Ms Eareckson Tada's hobbies included riding horses, hiking, tennis, and swimming.

But on July 30, 1967, she dived 
headfirst into Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and severed her spinal cord after misjudging the water
 depth. The accident left her 
completely 
paralyzed.

During two years
 of painful rehabilitation she began the long process of adapting to her
 wheelchair-bound life.

'I still loved Joni, but one night I sat
 down on the bed and just said, Joni, I'm feeling trapped'

Despite experiencing anger,
 depression, suicidal thoughts,and religious doubts, she managed to push 
through, even learning how to paint with a brush held 
between her teeth.

To 
date, she has written over forty books, recorded several musical albums,
 starred in an autobiographical movie of her life, and is an advocate 
for disabled people.

In her early thirties, after being single for a decade, Ms Eareckson Tada met Mr Tada during a 'boring' sermon at a local church. From there they kept running into each other and eventually arranged to meet-up.

'I was nervous when I met him,' Ms Eareckson Tada told Today. 'I had lived enough years as a single girl. I was traveling a 
great deal and enjoyed my freedom. No one had ever asked me out on a 
date.'

But the date went without a hitch and less than a year later they got engaged.

'I was blown away with this good-looking
 guy who was strong and handsome and shared the same values and 
convictions as I,' Mrs Eareckson Tada recounted. 'I readily said yes.'

Her disability has not stood in the way of 
their physical intimacy, she said - 'but we understand that there is 
more to romance than what happens below the waist.'

She tried unsuccessfully to become pregnant early on in their marriage.

The Tadas' new book is not arranged in chronological order and starts with Ms Eareckson Tada's battle with Stage III breast cancer.

She was diagnosed in 2010 after discovering a lump on her chest and went through a mastectomy and months of chemotherapy.

Mr Tada explained that the cancer bought them closer together and he saw his wife as 'a real warrior and a fighter.'

They say that they are troubled by the fact that so many marriages fail today.

Celebrating the bond he has with his wife, Mr Tada concluded: 'Joni is my biggest supporter.

'She is in my corner and my best friend. She always looks out for my interests and makes me love her that much more.'
