Vincenzo Nibali was finally rewarded with a kiss after finishing safely in the third stage of the Tour de France to retain the overall lead.

The Italian was left embarrassed after leaning in for a kiss with a podium girl following his stage two win only to be awkwardly rejected, but there was a happier ending this time round.

Marcel Kittel won stage three, the final stage on UK soil - the 155-kilometre route from Cambridge - ahead of the race's return to France with a typically dominant sprint finish.

Nibaldo had previously stormed to victory on the stage between York and Sheffield but 
he was rejected by the podium girl when he went in for a celebratory 
kiss during the presentation of his yellow jersey.

He was given his maillot jaune
 and handed some flowers but as he went in for a kiss the podium girl 
awkwardly pulled away, leaving the Team Astana rider hanging.

The finish to the final stage here in England proved fairly predictable.

With Mark 
Cavendish already out of the race with injury, it was left to the 
powerfully built German Kittel to burst away from
 the peloton for the second time in three days to secure victory on The 
Mall.

Just across to where the team vehicles were gathered on Horseguard’s Parade, however, it was rather more chaotic. 

Emergency
 repair works on the Eurotunnel had the 22 teams in something of a panic
 - the riders might have been flying to France on Monday night but talk 
of ‘six hour delays’ had them concerned their bikes might be delayed.
