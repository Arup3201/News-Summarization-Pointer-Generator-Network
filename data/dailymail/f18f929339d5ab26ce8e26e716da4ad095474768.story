Alexander McQueen's wildy romantic fairytale show in Paris may have had fashion fans under a spell but it's bound to rile animal lovers.

From hand-cut fur pom poms to hooded fur gilets, the fashion house's AW14 was almost entirely made up of the controversial material. 

Designer Sarah Burton, who came to the attention of the wider public after designing the former Kate Middleton's wedding dress, sent her models down the runway as fairy-tale heroines roaming a make-believe forest with their fur-embellished gowns trailing behind them.

Fur galore: Nearly all of the models wore fur in Alexander McQueen's AW14 show in Paris yesterday

According to her show notes,
 the inspiration was floral and nocturnal fauna, Beauty and the Beast, and wild romance.

By swathing her models in super-sized hooded fur coats, Burton made it clear that fur is back on the fashion agenda for AW14.

This is a stark contrast to the late Eighties when celebrities queued up to express their horror at the thought of so much as a mink-trimmed cuff.

PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) was born and in 1994 five supermodels posed nude to protest against wearing fur, along with the slogan 'I'd rather go naked than wear fur.' This campaign has run and run and was most recently fronted by Khloe Kardashian.

Such was public disgust, those who did venture out in a pelt were likely to find themselves splattered with red paint (or a dead raccoon in Anna Wintour's case).

But these good intentions didn't last long and slowly, fur crept back into fashion.

Behind the scenes, the fur industry is fighting back, encouraged, it seems, by fashion's most influential - such as Kate Moss and Rihanna - who trot out draped in the stuff.

So is fur back in fashion and will we all be wearing it come autumn?

No, say PETA [People
 for the Ethical Treatment of Animals], who point to a recent Times News
 Service poll which found that 95 per cent of British women say they 
wouldn't wear fur.

'Fashion designers should be forward-thinking innovators. In contrast, parading animal pelts down the catwalk is simply archaic,' said a spokesman.

'Stella McCartney, Calvin Klein, Simone Rocha, Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren, Lacoste and Diesel are just some of the designers that shun fur and instead work with luxurious, exciting, sophisticated, cruelty-free fabrics, from metals to spun acrylic and satin, and we hope to see Burton embrace new cutting-edge fabrics that don't bleed. In this day and age, there's absolutely no reason for animals to be killed for fashion.'

'I wonder how many animals had to die for
 Rita Ora and Rihanna’s wardrobes. They might be chart toppers, but 
they’re also barbarians'

Fashion blogger Simon Glazin was appalled by what he saw on the catwalk. He said: 'I actually gasped out loud when I trawled through the catwalk shots from Sarah Burton’s latest McQueen adventure. Not out of joy, but of sheer horror at the amount of fur she decided to use.

'The collection is named ‘Beauty and the Beast’ – but I’m inclined to add an –ly onto the end of the latter.

'The mind boggles. Do these designers just turn a blind eye to the fur industry? Do they just think it happens to fall off the animals in a glorious, gift-giving way like apples dropping from their branches?

'I realise there are those customers who demand fur, who love to wrap themselves up in the stuff, but it’s down to the labels and editors (yes, you Anna Wintour!) to stop this happening. You can do glamour without skinning foxes and mink alive – just look to Stella McCartney or brilliant faux fur label, Shrimps. I imagine if these fashion houses decided to turn around imitation fur pieces too, they’d sell like hotcakes.

'You can bet your bottom dollar that the Duchess of Cambridge won’t be seen in any furry Alexander McQueen creations, she might even stay clear of the label altogether now. And I wouldn’t blame her. Mr and Mrs Kim Kardashian love a bit of fur, and I wonder how many animals had to die for Rita Ora and Rihanna’s wardrobes. They might be chart toppers, but they’re also barbarians.'

Celebrity stylist Alex Longmore added: 'Unfortunately, It does not surprise me one bit that there is fur on the McQueen catwalk. It's everywhere and is not just reserved for autumn. This SS14, Louis Vuitton have shaved mink dresses and the Fendi catwalk is full of fur - and that’s for the hot summer months!

'Gone are the days of supermodels posing for anti-fur campaigns with slogans such as "I'd rather go naked than wear fur". Once upon a time fur was deemed non-PC but now that rule has been totally sidelined. Fur seems to have been made not only fashionable but to be the ultimate in luxury by the design houses.

Generation cruel? Liberty Ross, Kate Moss and Kim Kardashian have all been spotted wearing fur coats - even though Kim's sister Khloe is the face of PETA's anti-fur campaign

'As a passionate animal lover, I find this very hard to stomach. I find it absolutely shocking that fur is being so accepted and is now trimmed on nearly every parka or winter coat you see on the high street.

'There are some seriously good faux fur available now, especially from Shrimps (sold on Avenue 32) which is the ultimate in cool and doesn’t hurt a soul. Of course it doesn’t help that celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, Kate Moss and Beyonce wear fur.

'If only they could see how it doesn’t need to be real to be on trend - see how good Laura Bailey and Fearne Cotton look - you can't even tell it isn't the real thing.'

Encouragingly, several industry heavyweights all refuse to use fur in their collections.

Stella McCartney is one designer for 
whom pelts just don't pay, telling Grazia that: 'everything in my store 
and every single garment and accessory that you see is cruelty free in 
the sense that no animal has died to make anything in here.'

And
 she's not alone. Sir Philip Green's Arcadia Group, which includes 
Topshop, Miss Selfridge and Dorothy Perkins, as well as All Saints, Vivienne 
Westwood, Calvin Klein, H&M, Selfridges, Harvey Nichols and Liberty 
have all pledged not to sell fur.

Even prestigious Mayfair haunt and celebrity nightspot Mahiki has vowed to turn away anyone wearing fur at the door - proving that you can have a look that
 kills without killing animals.
