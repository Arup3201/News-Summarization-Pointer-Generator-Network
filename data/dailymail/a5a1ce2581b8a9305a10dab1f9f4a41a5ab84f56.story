'A national health service': Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt (pictured in Downing Street yesterday) wants only permanent British residents to qualify for anything other than emergency care free of charge

The Labour party today dismissed plans to stop foreigners ripping off the NHS as 'xenophobic'.

Shadow health minister Diane Abbott claimed limiting access to free healthcare to permanent British residents risked 'stigmatising foreigners' and threatened public health.

Under the government's plan, foreigners coming to Britain will have to pay at least £200 to access free hospital care and pay a charge every time they visit a GP.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt wants only permanent British residents to qualify for anything other than emergency care free of charge.

He insists Britain has a ‘national health service, not an international health service’.

Controversial new proposals, to form a 
central part of the Government’s Immigration Bill, will include a new 
‘healthcare levy’ for anyone coming to the UK for more than six months, a
 charge to see family doctors for anyone here for less than six months, 
and a system to track migrant workers’ use of the NHS.

Ministers say non-UK residents are currently granted NHS numbers far too easily, usually after turning up at a GP surgery.

On referral to hospital, no further questions about their entitlement to treatment are asked – providing ‘health tourists’ or those who have fallen ill while in this country with unlimited free access to the NHS.

The new healthcare levy will be in addition to the visa charge for anyone coming to the UK for more than six months.

Currently, short-term migrants coming to the UK either to study or work, with more than six months on their visas, are likely to qualify for free hospital care as soon as they enter the UK.

The charge, which ministers expect to be at least £200 a year, will ensure that migrants contribute while not increasing red tape for doctors and nurses.

Landlords who fail to check that their
 tenants are not illegal immigrants face being fined up to £3,000 under 
plans unveiled today.

Ministers want to make it more difficult for people without permission to stay in the UK to carry on with their lives.

But landlords warn they are not ‘immigration experts’ and cannot be expected to do the work of border police.

All private landlords will have to carry out checks on the migration status of every tenant before renting out a room or house.

Immigration minister Mark Harper, pictured, said: 
‘The Government is determined to build a fairer system and to address 
the public's concern about immigration. ‘

The fines could be extended to families who take in a lodger.

Last night the plan was backed by Liz Kendall, a Labour shadow health minister, who said:
 ‘People who are not eligible for free care must pay for the treatment 
they receive and be rigorously pursued for the money they owe.’

She stressed that the last Labour government had taken some action on the issue and 'any abuse must be tackled'.

But today her colleague Ms Abbott dismissed the plan to stop money being wasted on treatment for people who not qualify.

Writing on Twitter she said: 'What price xenophobia? Stigmatising foreigners accessing NHS creates a public health risk.'

Labour party sources stressed that Ms Abbott's view was not the official party line.

But the extraordinary remark was condemned by the government. Conservative Party Chairman Grant Shapps said: 'Our NHS should be a national health service, not an international health service. That's fair for the hardworking people who pay for it.‬‬ ‪‪

'It's bizarre that Labour oppose this. Once again it shows that Ed Miliband is too weak to stand up for hardworking people.'

A Tory party source added: 'Diane 
Abbott’s comment shows Labour isn’t serious about getting fairness for 
the hardworking people whose taxes fund our NHS.

'We are taking action to ensure that people who are supposed to be paying for NHS care do so.

'It’s sad a Labour Shadow Health Minister thinks this is xenophobic.'

A government consultation being 
launched today will also explore whether migrants should be allowed to 
show they have private health insurance as an alternative.

Today’s
 proposals will also mean foreigners visiting for less than six months 
will no longer be able to see a GP for free, with a charge introduced.

Visitors from the EU would continue to 
access NHS for free but ministers say they will put in place systems for
 recovering the costs from their home countries.

Mr Hunt will propose a new 
‘registration and tracking system’ for visitors before they join a GP 
surgery, possibly linked to the NHS number.

Those
 with a ‘questionable’ residency status – meaning they should be billed 
for non-emergency NHS care – could be issued with only a temporary NHS 
number.

This would mean that if they tried to access anything other than accident and emergency departments, they would be charged.

The Health Secretary will also promise better checks to enforce charges for care in both hospitals and doctors’ surgeries.

He
 said: ‘We need to ensure that those residing or visiting the UK are 
contributing to the system, and that we do as much as possible to target
 illegal migration.

‘We are a national health service not an international health service and I am determined to wipe out abuse in the system.’

However Clare Gerada, who chairs the Council of the Royal College of General Practitioners, warned the measures posed a public health risk and she claimed it could end up costing the taxpayer more.

Immigrants with highly infectious conditions could end up ‘wandering around for fear of being charged’ or going to emergency units that were far more expensive to run than doctors' surgeries, she said.

‘What we don't want to do is put people at risk ... not just the migrants but also us,’ she told BBC Radio 4's Today.

‘People use the NHS if they've got infections and we certainly don't want to have people wandering around for fear of being charged at the GP surgery.’

She added: ‘At the moment we are fairly accessible and I think it is important to keep it that way.

‘I don't think we should be turning the GP surgery into a border agency.

'I think we should be making sure that people who do feel that they are ill can come and access us because we certainly don't want people who have got TB or HIV or any other infectious disease, or in fact anybody that believes themselves to be ill, to be frightened of seeing a GP for fear of being charged.’

National AIDS Trust comments on the Government’s consultation on limiting migrant access to the NHS, including charging for primary care. Deborah Jack, chief executive of the National AIDS Trust, added: 'If introduced, these policies will endanger the lives of people living with HIV and threaten the health of our community. 

'The proposals, if enforced, would undermine years of work by bodies such as NICE and the British HIV Association to encourage marginalised at-risk groups to access HIV testing and treatment.

'Public health experts agree that access to a GP is essential to reduce rates of undiagnosed and late diagnosed HIV, especially amongst those from black and minority ethnic backgrounds, as they are less likely to go to a sexual health clinic.'
