With President Obama well into his second term in office, it's never too early to contemplate who might be on the ballot in 2016.

Hilary Clinton is refusing to confirm at this early stage whether a 2016 run for the Democrats is in the offing, but on the other side many see former Florida Governor Jeb Bush as a likely candidate for the Republican party.

Certainly his brother and former President George W. Bush is hoping Jeb will make a run for it in just 43 months time.

Seeing triple: Could Jeb Bush (right) be the third President Bush if he becomes the Republican party's candidate in the 2016 election? Here he is pictured next to his brother former President George W Bush (center) and their father George Bush Snr (left)

When asked if the country is ready for another Bush, President Bush told Parade Magazine 'That’s for Jeb to figure out, you know what I mean? I would hope that people would judge [him], if Jeb were to run, on his merits and his track record.…So I hope he will run.'

He does have plenty of thoughts when it comes to running for office: ' My first advice would be, don’t be afraid of entering the arena, win or lose. It’s a great experience. People are going to automatically not vote for you because of your name.

On the other hand, people will listen to you because of your name, so I wouldn’t even worry about that. Just go out there and tell people what’s in your heart.'

The former Florida governor has not yet made a decision about the race in 2016.

He does not believe he will suffer from his brother's low popularity during his two terms as president.

Preparation: Could we expect to see more pictures like this of former Florida Governor Jeb Bush? Well, yes if he decides to run for the Presidency in 2016!

Familiar faces: Some are predicting Hilary Clinton to be the Democrats candidate of choice come 2016

A recent Public Policy Polling survey suggested that Jeb Bush might only attract around 30 per cent of the votes in a general election - but anything can happen in the next three and a half years.

Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush loom the largest over their respective parties as the long road toward 2016 begins.

After only just failing to secure the nomination in 2008 and achieving high approval ratings as America’s top diplomat she has a strong claim in being the Democrats front-runner.

If Jeb Bush were to run, it might not be as straight forward as a Clinton candidacy but his ties to Florida and Hispanics would make him a decent candidate for the Republicans.

Both Clinton and Bush have number of backers on both sides who are ready to sign up.

Backers: Both Clinton and Bush would have guaranteed support in terms of activists, fundraisers and ground staff if they decided to run for office

Republican strategist Alex Castellanos said that Americans are loyal to political families like they are loyal to trusted brand names.

'The political equivalent of a brand is the dynasty, the Bushes or Clinton's. And even if Coke produces New Coke, or Ford, an Edsel, now and then…. we remain loyal. We know and value what the brand stands for … otherwise, we wouldn’t want it rehabilitated.' Castellanos told Politico.

Even if Jeb Bush decides not to run, tt may not be the last the public have heard from the Bush's when it comes to public office; President Bush's nephew George P. Bush is running for Texas Land Commissioner.

During the interview, President Bush said he did not believe the Republican Party was 'doomed forever'.

He said, 'the party ought to nominate somebody who can stand by principles and explain why conservative principles are better for the vast majority of the citizens.'

President Bush has kept a low profile since leaving the White House in 2009.

He told the Dallas Morning News that people are surprised to know he likes to paint. 'Of course, some people are surprised I can even read,' he said.
