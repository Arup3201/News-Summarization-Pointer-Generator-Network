The Islamic State terror group has issued battlefield guidance to its commanders on how to stay alive and boost morale among the jiadhi fighters.

The move follows the loss of half of the ISIS leadership after sustained air strikes from Coalition planes.

Guidance published in the terrorist group's magazine Dabiq IS leaders are told: don't stand out from the ordinary fighters in case of becoming a target for the enemy; not to travel more than three to a vehicle; always wear body armour and a helmet; use code words to communicate; and use suicide attackers to raise morale.

Militants: Guidance published in the terrorist group's magazine Dabiq tells commanders how to stay alive and boost morale among the jiadhi fighters

The 30-point plan is published under the name of Abu Ayyub al-Masri, an ISIS founding jihadist who was killed by an American raid on his house in Iraq in 2010.

But its prominent publication in the ISIS house magazine yesterday is timely and is aimed at halting the high attrition rate among the IS leadership

Death toll: The prominent publication of the battlefield guidance is timely and is aimed at halting the high attrition rate among the ISIS leadership

According to recent reports ISIS' leadership in Syria and Iraq has been decimated by months of sustained air strikes, leaving the terror group in chaos and isolating leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Coalition warplanes and drones have killed more than 6,000 fighters since September, including more than half the militants serving on ISIS' ruling council, US Secretary John Kerry has claimed.

Among the dead jihadis is Abu Muslim al-Turkmani, a former Iraqi army lieutenant colonel considered Baghdadi's number two and ISIS' most senior militant in Iraq.

His death and that of as many as nine others on ISIS' 18-man leadership council have forced Baghdadi to promote local warlords to the status of regional commanders, as his inner circle of trusted advisers and battle-hardened loyalists becomes increasingly small.

Many of the commanders have been killed while travelling in convoys between Syria and Iraq.

Baghdadi has not been seen in public since July and there have been numerous unconfirmed reports that he suffered serious injury or possibly even death as a result of targeted airstrikes.

The likelihood, however, is that Baghdadi has been forced deep into hiding to avoid being targeted by jets that have destroyed more than 1,000 vehicles used by terrorists over the past five months.

Other senior figures within the terror group have not been afforded that luxury and still need to travel across the vast swathes of Syria and Iraq that remain under ISIS' control.

This forces them to make a decision whether to move as part of a large military convoy and risk being spotted by warplanes overhead, or whether to use cars that reduce the likelihood of aerial detection but leave them at risk of kidnap or killing at the hands if ISIS' rivals on the ground.

Running scared: The battlefield advice is also peppered with signs of paranoia about Coalition surveillance and espionage and warns commanders to watch for spies living among its fighters

Point 7 of the 30-point plan for ISIS leaders says 'Beware of standing out from others by way of the vehicle that you ride or the clothes that you wear..'

And point 11 warns: 'Don't neglect to take what you can of equipment, such as armor and helmets. Doing so is not cowardice, for Allah's Messenger (sallallāhu 'alayhi wa sallam), the bravest of all people, had armor.'

Number 13 advices: 'You should not have more than three fighters in any car, unless there's an overriding benefit in doing so.'

'The leader should establish a secure, elaborate method of communication between each of the detachments, and establish code words for them to use when communicating, and slogans to shout when they're fighting.'

But at the same time the commanders are warned that even in the face of air attacks they are not to 'use security as an excuse' to spend too much time away from the battlefield.

Dead: Among the dead jihadis is Abu Muslim al-Turkmani (left), a former Iraqi army lieutenant colonel considered Baghdadi's number two and ISIS' most senior militant in Iraq. Another former member of Saddam Hussein's army turned ISIS commander, Abu Musa al-Alwani (right), has also been killed

Killer: The ISIS militant known as Jihadi John is still free to commit barbaric slaughter, however

Point 5 warns: 'And beware of using security as an excuse, thereby ensuring your personal security and neglecting your subjects in the process, for what a terrible leader you would then be!'

The advice is also peppered with signs of paranoia about Coalition surveillance and espionage and warns commanders to watch for spies living among its fighters.

It warns: 'And be on guard against your enemy at all times so that he doesn't: a. Pounce on you from near. b. Assault you from far. c. Ambush you when you're inattentive. d. Or follow you when you're returning home.'

The guidance encourages the punishment of fighters who disobey orders or criticise the leadership: 'Punish those who do wrong for their actions, even if by boycotting them, since it's permissible for a leader to punish those who disobey his orders.'

'If you don't do so, those who perform well will begin to slack, and those who do wrong will become emboldened, things will get worse and your work will be ruined.'

Brutal: This latest graphic and shocking footage has all the militants' trademark slick production effects and features a light-skinned executioner dressed in similar costume to the now infamous 'Jihadi John'

Sick: The killer is seen ranting in Arabic behind the doomed prisoner before the HD footage is edited into slow-motion and the militant is seen catching the shotgun, thrown to him by somebody off camera

Earlier this week Islamic State terrorists released a horrific new video showing the execution of a prisoner killed with a pump-action shotgun.

This latest graphic and shocking footage has all the militants' trademark slick production effects and features a light-skinned executioner dressed in similar costume to the now infamous 'Jihadi John'.

The prisoner, believed to be a Syrian soldier captured by ISIS, is forced to wear the same kind of orange jumpsuit worn by Western hostages before they are savagely beheaded by the terror group.

The killer is seen ranting in Arabic behind the doomed prisoner before the HD footage is edited into slow-motion and the militant is seen catching the shotgun, thrown to him by somebody off camera.

Seconds later he fires a single round into the back of the victim's head causing horrific injuries far too graphic to publish. The film rewinds and replays the moment of impact in gruesome detail several times, before cutting to a shot of a pool of blood and the prisoner's dead body.

Islamic State hostage John Cantlie has told his family to 'let him go' and 'get on with their lives' - days after appearing on a propaganda video which he ominously warned was the last in the series.

In an article released last night for the terror group's magazine, Dabiq, Cantlie thanks his relatives and fiancee for their 'tireless efforts' campaigning for his release.

However, he adds: 'Let it go. Leave it be and get on with your lives, all of you'.

Referring to an interview given by his partner, the photo journalist says: 'That was my fiancee, whom I hope now has long since forgotten me and moved on.

'What can the remnants of one family, smashed and emotionally exhausted after two years of campaigning, be expected to do by themselves.'

In the article, Cantlie, 44, has also been made to criticise the international campaign of air strikes against Islamic State, claiming that 'every bomb dropped in Syria or Iraq serves as a recruitment tool for the Islamic State'.

Cantlie - who has previously claimed to have accepted that he is likely to be brutally murdered by the terrorists - said the video released three days ago (pictured) was 'the last in this series' 

The magazine and video have been released in the wake of the horrific video showing the burning to death of captured fighter pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh by IS fighters and claims by the group that US aid worker hostage Kayla Mueller had been killed in air strikes in revenge for the Jordanian's shocking murder.

There has been concern for the safety of Cantlie since he was captured in Syria in November 2012 together with the now murdered US correspondent James Foley.

Eight international hostages, including two Britons, have been executed by the group but during the period of their murders Cantlie has been used for a series of nine expertly-made propaganda videos by IS.
