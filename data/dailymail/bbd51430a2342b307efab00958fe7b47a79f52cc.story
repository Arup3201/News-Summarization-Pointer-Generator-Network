The threat of the deadly Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus has 'significantly increased', but officials claim the disease does not yet constitute a global public health emergency.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) said that, based on current information, the seriousness of 
the situation has risen, but added there is no evidence of 'sustained human-to-human transmission'.

The virus, which was first detected in Saudi Arabia in 2012, causes coughing, fever and sometimes fatal pneumonia.

MERS is a virus from the same family as 
SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which killed around 800 
people worldwide after it first appeared in China in 2002.

Like SARS, the virus causes a lung infection, coughing and breathing difficulties, and a temperature.

Additionally, MERS can also lead to rapid kidney failure.

There are no vaccines or antiviral treatments for MERS, and the disease kills approximately 30 per cent of those infected.

According to recent WHO figures, 496 MERS cases have been detected since September 2012.

The Saudi Arabia Health Ministry confirmed that 463 of these cases have been in the Gulf nation alone.

Little
 is known about the condition but experts believe it is most likely humans were first infected by camels.

The comments were made during a WHO emergency committee meeting that met
 on Tuesday.

This week, the same officials reported that following a further five deaths, the total number of people to die from the virus in the region is now 126.

It can also lead to rapid kidney failure. According to recent WHO figures, 496 MERS cases have been detected since September 2012

MERS has also spread to neighbouring countries, and in a number of cases, symptoms have been spotted across Europe, in the U.S, Philippines and Malaysia.

Following the meeting on Tuesday, the WHO released a statement saying: 'The committee concluded that the conditions for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) have not yet been met.'

Dr Ben Neuman, a virologist at the University of Reading, told MailOnline: 'This is a measured and sensible reaction to an evolving epidemic.

'There is already a substantial worldwide effort between scientists, doctors and public health officials to understand and stop the spread of MERS coronavirus.

'It is important to remember that MERS still does not spread very efficiently between people.  It is a very serious disease if you are unlucky enough to catch it, but the odds of catching the virus - even in Saudi Arabia - are still very small.'
