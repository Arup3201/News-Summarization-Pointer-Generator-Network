As far as surprises go, this has got to be one of the best.

After heading into the kitchen of their home in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, to start her breakfast, this woman is told to 'pack a bag' as she is being whisked away by her husband Derrick.

Her reaction is priceless -  a mix of disbelief, joy and bewilderment as she struggles to hold back tears.

Derrick's wife's reaction to being told she is being whisked away is priceless - and even more so when he hands her cash for the taxi to the airport

Filming the whole scene on his mobile phone, the husband tells his wife that she 'doesn't have to go to work today,' and that he isn't going either.

He then hands her a 20 euro note as a hint, telling that that she will need it as they are on their way to the airport.

'Happy anniversary! Five years,' exclaims the man, identified as Derrick.

At first his wife is confused, particularly when she is told she has an hour-and-a-half to pack a bag. 

Dismayed, she asks: 'You're not being serious? Do you promise?'

As she begins to cry tears of joy, she is comforted by the fact that her husband has already sorted who will look after the cats, before he urges her to get packing.

Little did the woman know on entering the kitchen area that she was set for the ultimate anniversary gift

'We're going to go to Europe,' the man tells his wife.

'Why do you think I've been working like bolt-loads of overtime.'

Emotions are running high for both, as the man admits to shaking on delivering the news. 

The video ends when Derrick's tearful wife says: 'Let me hug you!' 

'My wife thought we were leaving for work' Derrick explained after posting the video.

'Little did she know I already booked her the time off, and we were headed for the airport to fly to Europe for our five-year anniversary.'

For his first wedding anniversary with his wife Derrick decided to surprise her with a trip to Miami and a cruise through the Bahamas. 

When it came time for their fifth anniversary Derrick decided to go a step above and booked a trip to Belgium.
