Accused: The court heard PC Mark Milton's BMW 5 series patrol car had reached a maximum speed of 108mph before the crash

A police officer crashed his high-powered patrol car while driving at speeds of up to 108mph in a 40mph zone, a court has heard.

Pc Mark Milton is alleged to have reached the 'grossly excessive' speed shortly before his BMW 5 series was badly damaged when it drove over a traffic island.

The 46-year-old officer, whose vehicle suffered a shredded tyre and broken suspension strut, denies driving dangerously on the A442 at Cold Hatton, Shropshire, while on duty with West Mercia Police on the night of October 26, 2011.

Opening the case, prosecutor Pat Sullivan told Worcester Crown Court the incident data recorder fitted to the 5 Series BMW showed the vehicle was travelling at 92mph when it struck the raised 'splitter' island at about 10.30pm.

Mr Sullivan told jurors that Milton, who is based in Market Drayton, Shropshire, contacted his supervisor by radio several minutes after the collision claiming to have hit a kerb.

The court heard a colleague of PC Milton then attended the scene of the accident, which triggered the driver’s airbag.

Mr Sullivan said: 'Mark Milton explained that he had been chasing a car that he believed had been a stolen Audi.

'He was asked how fast he was driving and he said between 90 and 100mph.'

After examining the roadway, the court heard, it became obvious to PC Milton and his colleague that the car had struck the central island.

Alleging that the defendant’s driving fell way below the standard of a reasonable and prudent motorist, Mr Sullivan said: 'Where the collision had taken place the speed limit was 40mph.

'Therefore, an investigation into what had happened began internally within the police.'

On trial: Worcester Crown Court heard that investigators quickly realised PC Milton had not hit the kerb as he had claimed

Evidence for the inquiry was contained in the BMW’s data recorder, which was analysed by a collision investigator.

Mr Sullivan told the jury: 'He (the investigator) has concluded that the maximum speed attained by PC Milton as he drove along that piece of road - after the 40mph started and before the collision - was 108mph.'

Analysis of a 26-second section of the data available to investigators showed that the average speed of the car was between 98mph and 99mph.

Mr Sullivan told jurors: 'The Crown’s case is that this is grossly excessive speeding - so grossly excessive that it amounts to dangerous driving.'

The court heard the accident happened at such speed the patrol car was sent almost half a mile down the road before coming to a stop.

Witness PC Ian Edwards, a collision investigator with West Mercia Police, told the jury tyre marks showed that the BMW went onto a grass verge on the wrong side of the road.

Mr Sullivan told jurors: 'The Crown’s 
case is that this is grossly excessive speeding - so grossly excessive 
that it amounts to dangerous driving.'

He said: 'I was able to tell the vehicle had travelled 727 metres prior to coming to a stop.'

'There was about 26 metres before it goes onto the grass verge. It then travels along the grass verge and then comes back onto the road where it continues for some distance.

'I was able to go back 26.5 seconds prior to the impact. The record starts just before the BMW enters the 40mph speed limit.

'By the time the BMW returns to the carriageway (after travelling along the grass verge) it’s travelling at 68mph.'

The court heard Incident Data Recorder’s (IDR) are fitted to all patrol cars and only start recording when the computer becomes concerned about the vehicle’s activity.

Mr Milton denies dangerous driving and the trial continues.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
