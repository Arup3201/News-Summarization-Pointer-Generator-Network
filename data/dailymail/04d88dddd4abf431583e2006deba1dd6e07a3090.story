Former England defender Ashley Cole hasnâ€™t ruled out retiring this summer.

Cole, 33, is due to return from holiday this week to consider his options after being released by Chelsea and then left out of the World Cup.

He has attracted interest but feels he would have to play at a high level in the Premier League or abroad to be properly motivated.
