This is the moment a Jaguar driver dubbed 'Britain's angriest motorist' was caught on camera swearing at a cyclist 25 times in just 35 seconds.

Mark Baldwin, 60, launched the foul-mouthed tirade against cyclist Eddie Bell, 38, who captured the jaw-dropping footage on his helmet cam.

Mr Bell, a father-of-four, was out cycling on a country road in Pevensey, East Sussex, when Baldwin stopped his £45,000 Jaguar XF in a junction box designed for cyclists only.

Mark Baldwin, 60, (pictured) launched the foul-mouthed tirade against cyclist Eddie Bell, 38, on a road in Pevensey, East Sussex in March last year. The jaw-dropping footage was captured on Mr Bell's helmet cam

Mr Bell politely told him to move but 
the driver got out of his car and began an abusive rant - threatening to
 give him a 'f****** decking'.

The
 shocking incident, which occurred last March, saw Baldwin verbally 
abuse Mr Bell more than two dozen times during the one minute video – 
and use the word f*** at least ten times, c*** seven times, w***** eight
 times and s*** once.

The video also captures Baldwin hitting the unsuspecting cyclist on the head during the attack.

Mr
 Bell said: 'I threw my arms up in exasperation at having to share the 
cycle-only box with a car. The driver wound down his window and started 
swearing at me.

'When the lights changed, he turned left and I carried on straight. A few minutes later he sped past me.

'About three miles up the street, I could see he had pulled in and was walking towards me.'

The incident happened after Mr Bell pointed out Baldwin had stopped his £45,000 Jaguar in a cycling-only zone

Baldwin, who lives in a million-pound
 property in Longfield, Kent, pleaded guilty to using threatening or 
abusive words or behaviour with intent to cause the victim to think 
violence would be used against him.

The
 assault charge was dropped, but during his appearance at Hastings 
Magistrates' Court, Baldwin was fined £505, and ordered to pay £135 
costs and victim surcharge.

Mr
 Bell had only just got back on his bike when the incident occurred, 
having suffered a shattered pelvis and two broken hips in a horror crash
 in 2012.

He said: 'I'd 
never get into an altercation with a motorist, especially because I was 
so badly injured the last time I was knocked off my bike.'

'Hopefully he will think twice about his actions in the future.'

Father-of-four Eddie Bell (pictured) - who is a British Cycling-qualified coach - said the row developed after Baldwin, who is from Kent, allegedly crept into the green box and up to the advance stop line for cyclists

Baldwin was fined £505 by Hastings Magistrates' Court after pleading guilty to using threatening or abusive words or behaviour. The 60-year-old was also told to pay a further £135 in court costs and a victim surcharge

During the video, Baldwin yelled at Mr Bell: 'Get off, I'll show you who's a f****** w*****. I can't deal with that s***.

'You
 call me a w*****? You call me a f****** w*****? Am I a w***** or not? 
Am I w*****? Then why did you give it all that you c***.

'I said did you get in the box didn't I? Don't f****** give me all that you c***. Watch yourself you c***.

'Don't
 f****** get clever, I'll give you a f****** decking. Don't f****** tell
 me to calm down, you started it you c***. Now f*** off.

'Think yourself f****** lucky.'
