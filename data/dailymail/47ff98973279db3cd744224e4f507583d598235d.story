It’s awful news. In my long experience and years in football I cannot recall such an occasion. It’s bad.

Since I joined the club in 1971 and before then, Hereford were well run by local businessmen with the interests of the club at heart. It was always one of the best-run clubs in non-League football. They attracted bigger crowds and bigger names — the man who brought me in was the great John Charles.

But for one reason or another it’s gone away from that in the last few years. It is really sad. I’m a member of the Supporters’ Trust and I try to keep on top of what is going on — it’s not been nice to follow.

I was with Ronnie Radford just a couple of weeks ago filming something for the BBC about the FA Cup — it’s a shame to go from that to this. We are all scattered far and wide from that side but the club remains a big part of us.

What has happened has shocked me but I can’t say it has surprised me. What I hope happens now is that the club is eventually passed into the hands of the Supporters’ Trust. It can work when you do it that way. I certainly can’t see a shining knight coming in.

Ricky George scored the famous second goal in the 2-1 win when non-League Hereford knocked out First Division Newcastle in the FA Cup third round in 1972.
