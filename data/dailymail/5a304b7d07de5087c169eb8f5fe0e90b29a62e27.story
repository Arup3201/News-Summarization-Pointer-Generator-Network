Dame Jacqueline has battled health problems for some years and now needs a suitable donor

Children's author Dame Jacqueline Wilson has revealed her kidneys are so damaged she needs a transplant.

The Tracey Beaker creator is on the transplant list but has yet to find a donor.

She said that several friends have come forward to offer her an organ - but doctors have yet to find a suitable match.

Dame Jacqueline, 67, spoke out earlier this year about suffering kidney failure.

She has been receiving dialysis three times a week for four hours, the Mirror reports.

Now, her health has deteriorated and she faces the agonising wait for a donor.

She told the newspaper: 'I have had some amazing offers from people wanting to help but, unfortunately, they haven’t been compatible.

'I have to be realistic about what this means. It’s this strange situation where I just have to wait and see what happens.

'I am aware that it’s a long list and I’m just one of very many people on it.'

Dame Jacqueline has battled health problems for some time and was fitted with a heart defibrillator five years ago. 

Despite the bad news, she says she has no plans to stop writing - not least because it serves as a distraction.

She says she even tries to use the time spent having dialysis to write or think up new ideas.

And she adds that she now appreciates the importance of good health more than ever.

Despite the bad news, Dame Jacqueline says she has no plans to stop writing - not least because it serves as a distraction

Earlier this year she told the Daily Express: 'When I used to read interviews and people were asked "what do you wish for’ and answered ‘good health’, I would think, "how boring" because part of me imagined it would be quite glamorous to be an invalid.

'Now that I’m old and crumbling though, I can see the other side.'

She added that she also tries not to think about the situation too much - and plans to continue writing  - ideally two books a year - for the foreseeable future.
