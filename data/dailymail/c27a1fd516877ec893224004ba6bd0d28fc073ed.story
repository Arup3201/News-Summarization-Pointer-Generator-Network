A Texas man who confessed to killing his girlfriend has been arrested for murdering his aunt and almost shooting dead his cousin while out on bail for the first crime.

Dante Thomas, 20, of Houston, Texas, confessed to stabbing his girlfriend Linda Vu to death in front of her two children, and was released on $50,000 bail on January 31.

Then on Thursday he was arrested again, with a murder charge now pending in the shooting death of his aunt , 68-year-old Charlotte Ellis, who was found dead in her truck at the Willowbrook Mall on Wednesday evening.

Thomas had recently confessed to stabbing his girlfriend Linda Vu (above) to death in front of her two children, and was released on $50,000 bail on January 31

KHOU reports that Thomas' cousin Damtria Ellis was also shot, and while she survived may go blind as a result.

According to court documents, Thomas was at the mall at the time of the shootings, and called his mother for a ride, saying her and his cousin had been in an argument earlier in the day.

Thomas' mother claims she was driving Thomas to surrender, at which point he jumped out of her moving vehicle.

His bond has now been revoked, and the District Attorney explained that $50,000 is the standard bail for any murder suspect with no past record.

'It's kind of crazy, he shouldn't have even been released,' said a woman who lived in Vu's apartment complex.

'He already killed somebody and then two more people, that's crazy.'
