One of Britain’s swankiest casinos has come up with a revolutionary way of getting round the smoking ban – by putting gaming tables on its new roof garden.

The multi-million-pound development at the Hilton Hotel in Park Lane, Central London, will enable clients to enjoy a cigarette and gamble at the same time, and is expected to be particularly popular with wealthy clients who find the ban on smoking in enclosed public spaces irksome.

The move will see a return to the days of Dr No, when Sean Connery as 007 meets the voluptuous Sylvia Trench at Le Cercle club, languidly puts a Morland cigarette to his lips and introduces himself with the immortal line: ‘Bond. James Bond.’

Today, the suave spy would be liable for prosecution for breaking the smoking ban – the reason why a roof garden extension is being added to the hotel’s Park Lane Casino for its aptly named ‘high rollers’.

David Mills, the hotel’s operations director, said: ‘Many of our clients come from countries where smoking bans do not apply. We want to provide them with a relaxing and enjoyable experience.’

Gaming tables will be placed on the terrace so that roulette, blackjack, baccarat and three-card poker can be played under the stars, although Westminster Council has banned live and recorded music in case it disturbs nearby residents.

A gambling industry source said: ‘It’s no secret that casinos have been looking for ways to get round the smoking ban since it was introduced in 2007 and this is one of the solutions they have come up with.’

London is a favoured destination for international gamblers, many of whom are from the Middle East, and bets totalling millions of pounds are placed at casinos each night.

Earlier this year, Mariam Aziz, the former wife of the world’s richest man, the Sultan of Brunei, described in court how she went on ‘reckless gambling sprees’ in Mayfair. 

Among the clubs visited were Les Ambassadeurs, Aspinalls and Rendezvous, and she confessed to blowing £500,000 in a single night.

The Park Lane Casino opened at the Hilton last November, and membership costs £1,000 a year. The terrace on a new second-floor extension is due to open in April.
