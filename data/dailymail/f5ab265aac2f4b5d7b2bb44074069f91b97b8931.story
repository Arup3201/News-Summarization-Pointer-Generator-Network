Two men will appear in court charged with endangering an aircraft after a passenger jet was diverted mid-flight.

The men, British nationals aged 30 and 41 and who have not been named, will appear at Chelmsford Magistrates Court tomorrow.

An RAF Typhoon jet was scrambled to escort the Boeing 777 over UK airspace, and the pair were arrested after armed police boarded the plane.

The Typhoons were scrambled from RAF Coningsby in Lincolnshire, as a precaution.

For more than three decades, Stansted has been the designated airport for hijacks and major security incidents, with a remote area known as Compass Base set aside far from the main terminal.

Armed officers from Essex Police boarded the Boeing 777 and arrested two British men, aged 30 and 41, on suspicion of 'endangerment of an aircraft'

The jet had taken off from Allama Iqbal International airport (pictured). As soon as the plane landed armed police swarmed aboard and removed two men
