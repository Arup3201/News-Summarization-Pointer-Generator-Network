Jailed: Steven Ray Milam, 44, will spend 35 years in federal prison for committing 11 bank robberies

A bank robber dubbed the 'handsome guy bandit' for his bizarre hold-up costume, has been jailed.

Steven Ray Milam, 44, will spend 35 years in federal prison, a judge ruled on Monday, after he pleaded guilty to 11 robberies in May.

Wearing an $810 Hollywood-pro latex mask to hide his features, and brandishing a gun, Milam stormed Dallas banks and demanded cash.

He was eventually caught after a high-speed police chase and shootout in Mississippi on New Year's Eve, having left 61 victims in his wake.

That final robbery began when he entered the BBVA Compass Bank in Richardson wearing his signature mask, black frame glasses, and latex gloves.

Carrying a black semi-automatic handgun and a clear bag, Milam forced staff and customers into the bank's vault, demanding money from the manager.

'No dye packs or trackers,' he said. 'I’ll kill you if you put them in the bag.'

He then told his victims to count to 500 and not contact the police before fleeing the scene.

As he left he was approached by police and began shooting at their squad car. They backed off and he ran home, packing a bag and driving to Austin where he spent the night.

The following day he set off for Florida and was spotted in Mississippi by police who gave chase after he refused to pull over.

They put out road spikes as Milam stormed down the highway reaching speeds of 85mph, almost smashing into cars as he did.

Officers were forced to shoot out his back tire as a last resort and eventually arrested him.

'Some people would say you’re lucky,' District Judge Sam Lindsay told Milam during sentencing. 'It’s a wonder you’re not dead now.'

Milam was charged with one count of brandishing a firearm during or in relation to a crime of violence and one count of using, carrying and brandishing a firearm during or in relation to a crime of violence.

'Words will never be able to express how sorry I am,' he said. 'I have failed as an individual.'
