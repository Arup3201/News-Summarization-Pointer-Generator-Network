A Saudi Arabian man injured in the Boston Marathon bombings has filed a defamation lawsuit against Glenn Beck after the conservative radio host accused him of being 'the money man' behind the fatal attack.

The former Fox News host concocted a conspiracy theory following the April 2013 attack that connected Alhabri to al Qaeda and from there linked the idea to the Obama administration.

Adding to the absurdity of Beck's claims that Abdulrahman Alharbi, 20, was a conspirator in the Boston bombings is the fact that Alharbi was a spectator at the race who was one of hundreds of people injured in the terrorist attack.

Conspiracy theory: Glenn Beck claimed that a Muslim victim of the Boston Marathon bombing was somehow behind the attack

Not involved: Abdulrahman Alharbi was investigated after the bombing and authorities quickly concluded he had nothing to do with the attack

Beck hinged his theory that Alharbi was 
somehow responsible for the attack on the fact that he 'was set to be 
deported under section 212 3B' for 'terrorist activities.'

The radio host spent the next several days lobbing unfounded accusations against the young Saudi Arabian man, challenging anyone who didn't believe him to prove him wrong.

Beck even suggested that President Obama was somehow involved in the attack after photos emerged of what appeared to be Michelle Obama visiting Alharbi in the hospital following the attack - as she did with dozens of the bombing victims.

Beck's campaign to pin the attack on Alharbi was stalled when a former immigration official explained to him how a person would get the designation of 212 3B, and how his theory about Alharbi 'doesn't make sense.'

After the appearance by former INS Special Agent Bob Trent seemed to discredit the majority of Beck's theory, the radio host went from talking about it every day to rarely mentioning it, apparently hoping his listeners would forget that it ever happened.

One person who definitely didn't forget is Alharbi, who has named Beck and his companies, The Blaze Inc. and Mercury Radio Arts - as well as his radio syndicator, Premier Radio Networks - in the defamation lawsuit it filed in federal court.  

Tragic: Three people were killed during the bombing, as well as a police officer fatally shot by one of the suspected bombers

According to the suit, first obtained by Courthouse News, Beck 'repeatedly and falsely' identified Alharbi as having been an active participant in the attack.

On April 21, less than a week after the attack, Beck went on his radio program and said, 'Let me just say this to those at the highest echelons of government, we know who this 
Saudi national is, and it is in your best interest and the best interest
 of integrity and trust for the people of United States of America – 
it’s best coming from you, not coming from a news organization. It’s 
best coming from you. You have until (April 22). We have information on 
who this man is, (and) we know he is a very bad, bad, bad man.'

Beck later identified this 'very bad, bad, bad man ' as Alharbi.

After the April 15 bombing, authorities questioned Alharbi, who allowed officer to search his apartment.

Authorities quickly determined that Alharbi had nothing to do with the bombing - other than having been injured in the attack.

Alharbi was one of about 265 people injured during the April 15, 2013, blast th

But Beck's onslaught claiming he was a terrorist waged on - which led to harassment from those who those who believed Alharbi was responsible for the bombing.'

According to the suit, since Beck made his claims that Alharbi was behind the terrorist attack, people have left the young Saudi messages calling him a 'murderer, child killer, and terrorist.'

The harassment, Alharbi's attorneys say, was the direct result of Beck's unfounded claims that he was involved in the bombings.

'Those statements were made widely and publicly,' the suit claims. 'The 
statements were false and did grave injury to the plaintiff.'

Alharbi is seeking punitive damages for defamation with malice.
