A teenage girl who was left in a coma after a suspected hit-and-run has spoken out for the first time.

In an interview with Nine Network's A Current Affair on Tuesday night, April Lee Gillen tried to recall the night that changed her life.

The 17-year-old, of Berkeley which is south of Sydney, also told of the shocking moment she woke up to discover that she was pregnant.

Police, who described the hit-and-run incident 10 months ago as 'a horrific and violent attack against a young vulnerable girl', have also revealed the case is now being investigated as an attempted abduction.

While she was in hospital, April discovered she was pregnant and gave birth to her son on Christmas Eve

April was walking home after a date with her boyfriend on the night of April 19 when police claim she was hit by a car.

At about 2am the following morning, April was found on the kerbside and was quickly rushed to hospital in a critical condition.

Daily Mail Australia previously reported the teen was admitted to hospital in a critical condition after suffering 'extensive head injuries' a police statement said in April.

In what could be a clue for investigators, she is believed to have posted the following status to her Facebook account shortly before the incident.

'Phones on 1 percent walking from warrawong to berks (Berkeley) and some Asian guy just stopped me telling me to come home with him cause it's safe and I need help wtf sos'.

According to police, a number of residents near Northcliffe Drive in Lake Heights - where April Lee was hit - heard a 'loud noise' shortly before the critically injured teenager was found bloodied on the side of the road.

Many questions are still left unanswered for April (left) and her mother Leonie (right)

In what could be a clue for investigators, she is believed to have posted the following status to her Facebook account shortly before the incident

At the time Lake Illawarra Inspector Steve Worthington told reporters: '(The Facebook message) is certainly vital information our detectives are following up, but until we can speak to April herself, we need further information from the public.' 

April was in an induced coma for two weeks with a severe brain injury.

'After I found out that it was an abduction I was terrified,' she told A Current Affair.

'If I didn't put up that fight I could be dead right now.'

But there were many questions that still remain unanswered for April to this day.

'I just think: "Why me? Why did you pick me out of all people?",' she said.

'I wouldn't wish this on anyone - what I went through... no other teenager girls.'

And as April continued her recovery for two months at Wollongong Hospital, she also made another shocking discovery. 

According to police, a number of residents near Northcliffe Drive in Lake Heights - where April Lee was hit - heard a 'loud noise' shortly before the critically injured teenager was found bloodied on the side of the road

Police releaved CCTV footage of a black BMW SUV that was near where April was found

'Am I pregnant? Oh my goodness!' April recalled the moment when her sister broke the news.

'I said to mum it's my little baby. I'm giving birth to him and bringing him into this world so I'm not going to think about getting rid of him at all.'

But for mother Leonie, who initially thought she had lost her daughter, her concerns grew about whether April was able to raise a child.

'Later on as April healed much more she was clearer, well spoken and quite determined in what she wanted so I said to April I will be right by her side. And it's the best decision we've made,' she said.

Baby Jacobie was born on Christmas Eve and April is grateful for her mum's support.

'Thank God my mum's there beside me. She helps me a whole lot. I wouldn't be here without my mum.'

However the investigation is ongoing as police released CCTV footage of a black BMW SUV which was seen in near where April was found.

Acting Superintendent Andrew Koutsoufis told A Current Affair the incident was 'a horrific and violent attack against a young vulnerable girl'.

'We believe she was dragged in that vehicle and something has happened in that vehicle and shortly after she was ejected from the vehicle and dragged along where she suffered some serious injuries,' he said.

April's mother is desperately appealing for anyone with information to come forward. 

'Don't just walk away. It's a very big thing to live with for the rest of your life if you know who did that. We're all human beings but it's not a right thing to do on a young girl like that.'
