John Bercow was last night accused of turning Westminster into a ‘Big Brother-style’ TV show after allowing cameramen into the Commons chamber for the first time.

Until now, coverage of debates has been recorded by remote-controlled cameras set above the famous green benches.

But at Prime Minister’s Questions on Wednesday, two cameramen will film close-up shots of MPs from the floor of the House itself after the Speaker approved the plans.

Demeaning: John Bercow has been accused of turning Westminster into a 'Big Brother-style' TV show after allowing cameramen into the Commons chamber

Tory MP Brian Binley has warned the ‘eye-level’ cameras, to be placed either side of the Speaker’s Chair, will ‘demean’ the Commons.

He said: ‘I understand the balance between the media and Parliament is a fine and delicate one. However, this is cheapening the Commons with some sort of political Big Brother-style show.’

But Labour MP Thomas Docherty, a key backer of the plan, said that it was nonsense to suggest the Speaker’s move would hurt Parliament’s reputation. ‘If this makes some Tory MPs better behaved for once, that’s a good thing in itself,’ he said. ‘It’s important for democracy to help the public see what goes on in Parliament.’

New start: Remote controlled television cameras have been allowed into the Commons for 25 years. From Wednesday there will also be cameramen

Television cameras were first allowed into the Commons 25 years ago only after strict rules had been brought in for filming to allay MPs’ fears that they would be shown in a less than flattering light in embarrassing shots.

The filming this week is being carried out for a four-part BBC series on life at Westminster called Inside The Commons, to be broadcast next year and presented by respected political documentary maker Michael Cockerell.

A spokesman for Mr Bercow said he had given ‘special permission’ after documentary-makers claimed the ‘fixed filming’ arrangements were insufficient.
