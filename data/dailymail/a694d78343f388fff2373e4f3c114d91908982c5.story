Andy Murray had reduced a hostile Court Philippe Chatrier to the silence of the lambs after two sets of an extraordinary French Open quarter-final as he overwhelmed local hero Gael Monfils.

Many of the Frenchman’s fellow Parisians filed out to find dinner or somewhere warm, disillusioned by the inferiority of their man. Within an hour, those left were roaring Monfils towards a fifth set — only to end up wondering why they had bothered.

At 9.41pm, Murray completed the second turnaround of a bewildering contest by rampaging through an unlikely final set in just 24 minutes to go through 6-4, 6-1, 4-6, 1-6, 6-0 in three hours and 15 minutes.

On Friday the 27-year-old Scot has a repeat of his 2011 semi-final against Rafael Nadal, who somehow managed to finish earlier after losing the first set. He came back to defeat David  Ferrer 4-6, 6-4, 6-0, 6-1, but at least he will not have the advantage of an extra day’s rest, as had seemed probable.

Pumped up: Andy Murray celebrates as he beats Frenchman Gael Monfils in a deciding fifth set

Good game, good game: The two protagonists shake hands after a match that will live long in the memory

That
 was a relatively routine affair compared to the madness being played 
out on the main arena, the type that comes from having two of the 
world’s most enigmatic performers facing off.

Murray played superbly at 
the start,  sticking to a clever gameplan to deny Monfils the pace he 
loves but then opening his shoulders to thump winners when the 
opportunity arose. It was hard to recall his backhand down the line 
ever  having been so devastating.

To Monfils’s credit, he turned it 
around, and the debate became whether this would be the first time since
 2005, when Murray was a  callow 18-year-old with brittle legs playing 
at his first Wimbledon, that the Scot might lose a five-set match from 
2-0 up.

He has played 21 since, and  that record stands intact after 
his explosive sprint to the finish line that came after he had looked 
down and out in the fourth set, complaining after its conclusion that he
 was being made to play on.

Day in the sun: Andy Murray raced into a two-set lead but was pegged back by the unpredictable Gael Monfils

Serving up a treat: Murray was initially the aggressor but was pegged back by an inspired Monfils in front of a partisan crowd 

The key to his transformation was 
breaking in the second game of a decider which began at 9.17pm with the 
light fading and the temperature dropping.

Suddenly it was Murray who wanted to continue and he went on to beat an opponent who had the energy sucked out of him.

Desperate
 to finish so as not to face playing on a fifth day out of six ahead of 
the Nadal clash, he hit out freely while Monfils, to the consternation 
of his supporters, failed  to stem the haemorrhage of games in the 
gloaming. Monfils said  afterwards he had been happy to finish the 
match, while Murray insisted he was, too.

‘I was told we had 20 
minutes left, a maximum of six games,’ said the Scot. ‘It was very dark 
at the end and thankfully he played a poor fifth set once I got ahead 
after really raising his level in the fourth.

‘It was tough 
conditions, very windy at the start and I began well. When the wind 
calmed down he began to play so much better. He’s such an incredible 
athlete, he gets to so many balls. It’s definitely a big achievement to 
have got this far but it’s not what I came here to do. I set myself some
 big goals.’

It will be very difficult but the Murray of the first, 
second and fifth sets has a puncher’s chance against Nadal. The one of 
the third and fourth faces a knockout.

Breathtaking: Murray was brilliant when push came to shove with Monfils dazzling for two sets

Murray had walked on to a 
mixture of the residual cheers for the preceding Monfils, mixed in with 
boos to warn him of what might lie in store. His response was to smile, 
but the most effective way of shutting the previously rain-sodden 15,000
 spectators out of the match would be with his racket, and that was what
 he proceeded to do.

And for the second match in  succession he 
sportingly conceded a point to his opponent, this time as he tried to 
close out the second set in a marathon game. A ball fell from his pocket
 as he blasted a forehand into the net and umpire Jake Garner called a 
let.

Amid a cacophony of booing, the two players and the official 
held a mid-court conference, which ended with the Scot giving away the 
point, which he did not need to do. That became irrelevant as he went on
 to close it out on an eighth set point to put himself in full command  
and convince many of Monfils’s fans that this was no longer worth the 
bother.

Power: Monfils hits a forehand as he fights back from two sets down to level the match

The deserters missed Monfils digging in admirably, cutting 
down on the forehand misses and orchestrating those loyal stayers to get
 behind him once he had saved three break points early in the third. 
They traded games evenly until the death, when he broke a frustrated 
opponent.

By then there looked to be not enough light left for Murray
 to lose, but Monfils knew winning the fourth could offer him the 
sanctuary of a night’s rest — although it was the stiffening Murray who 
looked like he needed that more.
