Floyd Mayweather Jnr may be undefeated in the ring - but he more than met his match in a south London barbers.

The undefeated world champion, who retained his welterweight title last month, was in Brixton on Tuesday night for a trim.

But he was accosted by a female customer who told him she had no idea who he was, infuriating Mayweather and his 'Money Team' crew.

Boxing champion Floyd Mayweather Jnr was shocked when a woman told him she didn't know who he was

Mayweather beat Marcos Maidana (right) for a second time in their rematch in Las Vegas last month to retain his welterweight title

Mayweather did his best to convince the woman that he was the biggest name in boxing, but she did not buy it

'I don't know you,' she said in a video posted on SpiffTV. 'What's the big deal? I just don't watch boxing. I know about Mike Tyson.'

Mayweather, who was accompanied by several members of his 'Money Team' inner circle of friends, appeared stunned and retorted: 'You know what? I need to Google you!'

But the woman refused to back down, saying: 'I just want to know what the biggest fight you ever fight is? 

'I like big fights, I like exciting fights,' she says. 'If it's not big, I don't watch it.'

At this point, one of Mayweather's team interjects: 'He's the biggest in the world.'

Unrelenting, the woman takes another dig when she says: 'I know Usain Bolt', to which Mayweather responds: 'Who?'. 

Multi-millionaire Mayweather posted this picture on Twitter of him lying in bed with piles of money

The woman said she had heard of Mike Tyson, who was the undisputed heavyweight world champion and one of the most feared boxers on the planet

The 37-year-old, by now struggling to convince her, tries one last time: 'Do you know what Forbes Magazine is? Well you go and pull up one of those.

'You know the Money Man? He makes over $100m in 60 minutes.'

According to Forbes, Mayweather made $105m (£65m) from his first fight with Maidana and his clash with Saul Alvarez last year, a total of 72 minutes in the ring.

Usain Bolt saw the funny side, however, tweeting: 'I had to laugh..well I should take comfort in the fact that she know Usain Bolt.'

Mayweather has been on a whirlwind tour of Europe, having been in Paris last weekend before heading for Istanbul and London. 

He then delivered a boxing masterclass in Moscow on Wednesday. 

He is expected to return to the ring in May with Briton Amir Khan among those clambering for a pay day.
