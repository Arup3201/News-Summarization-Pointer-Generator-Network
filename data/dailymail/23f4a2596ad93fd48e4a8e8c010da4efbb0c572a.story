It was always going to be a magical event, but as the stars of the Harry Potter films lined the red carpet at Universal Studios Florida, it became clear that The Boy Who Lived will always be The Chosen One.

The Orlando theme park is launching Diagon Alley, a recreation of the hidden London shopping street only known to magical beings, which more than doubles the size of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter attraction.

Helena Bonham Carter, who plays villainous Bellatrix Lestrange, joined Dumbledore's Army favourites Matt Lewis, Evanna Lynch, Bonnie Wright and Jamie and Oliver Phelps in the less-than-London weather in the Sunshine State.

Latest addition: The Diagon Alley, which officially opend on July 8, doublkes the size of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Orlando

Matt Lewis, who played Neville 
Longbottom throughout the franchise, said the Gringotts Wizarding Bank 
was a new experience even for him.

'My
 character never really went to Gringotts, which is why I've enjoyed it 
so much because I never really got to go onto the set.

‘I never even saw it, so when I got to the bank today that was the first time and it’s pretty special.

‘I don't even know why I'm here,’ he joked. ‘I've just come down for a free ride really.’

Million miles from London: Helena Bonham Carter, who lent her voice to the attraction, unveiled the recreation of the wizarding world's London shopping street, hidden from the muggle world

Harry's ladies: Bonnie Wright, who played Ginny Weasley, was joined on the red carpet by Evanna Lynch, who played quirky Rawenclaw student Luna Lovegood

What a transformation! Matthew Lewis, who plays Neville Longbottom in the films, looked particularly handsome as he posed in a white shirt

Voldemort's right-hand woman, known to muggles as Helena Bonham Carter, even lent her voice to the new attraction.

The actress, 48, said:
 'I mean it is very sophisticated, all this cutting edge stuff and very, 
very complicated but it was fun to do, I mean she's always been fun to 
get back into.

'Maybe
 because I'm, I'm not much of a sadist but I've got an easy access to my
 inner child, Bellatrix is pretty much a perpetual five year old if not 
less - three year old maybe. So that was easy.'

Warrick
 Davis, who starred as goblin Griphook as well as the goblin who shows 
Harry to his own vault at Gringotts in the first film said he had a 
strong association with Diagon Alley and the magical bank.

‘It’s
 lovely to be involved with an attraction like this because you're kind 
of immortalised forever and millions of people are going to come through
 here and experience it.’

It's
 the twins! James and Oliver Phelps, who play Fred and George Weasley, 
swapped their red hair for brown as they posed together

Bellatrix returns: Helena Bonham Carterhas lent her voice to part of the attraction at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter Diagon Alley

Dashing: Tom Felton flashed his charming smile as she chatted to reporters

However, the Star Wars actor pointed out one key flaw in the Orlando version of Diagon Alley

‘They have got one thing wrong, the authenticity falls apart because it's not raining.

‘The
 weathers all wrong here. I would've thought they'd put up some sort of 
sphere over the whole thing and made it cold and damp,’ he joked.

The
 teenage wizard’s creator J.K. Rowling said: ‘I'm so pleased that The 
Wizarding World of Harry Potter has proved so popular to date, and I'm 
sure that the attention to detail in creating the new Diagon Alley area 
will make this an even better experience.’

A
 small army of production staff has been working up to 100 hours a week 
to painstakingly recreate the alley from Fred and George Weasley’s joke 
shop through to the eerie Knockturn Alley.

The
 chandeliers are made with more than 26,000 crystals.There is even a 
60-foot, fire-breathing Ukrainian Ironbelly dragon, which as fans of the
 series know was used to guard several high-security vaults, including 
the Lestrange Vault, at Gringotts Wizarding Bank.

Where is the rain: Warwick Davies pointed out a flaw with the Florida version of Diagon Alley - the distinct lack of bad London weather

'And then Ron said...': Matt Lewis makes Domhnall Gleeson, better known as Bill Weasley, laugh as they walk the red carpet with Evanna Lynch

A launch of giant proportions: Robbie Coltrane raises Hagrid's famous pink umbrella as the attraction opened at the event

The bank is decorated in marble with animatronic goblins grumbling either side of the hall. 

Take
 the Gringotts ride and you will come face to face with trolls, dragons 
and even the Dark Lord himself so you can imagine yourself alongside 
Harry in this pivotal scene from the final book and film.

Mark
 Woodbury, the president of Universal Creative, said: ‘Harry Potter and 
the Escape from Gringotts will change the way you think about theme park
 attractions.

‘We’ve
 created an entirely new type of ride that propels guests into the story
 like never before, and guests will remember it long after their visit 
to Diagon Alley.’

The Wizarding World of Harry Potter's Diagon Alley will officially open on July 8, allowing guests to experience even more of Harry Potter's adventures

Located in the Universal Studios Florida theme park, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter - Diagon Alley will feature shops, dining experiences and the next generation thrill ride, Harry Potter and the Escape from Gringotts

Escape from Gringotts: Tthe  new attraction found withinThe Wizarding World of Harry Potter is a multi-dimensional thrill ride that will place riders in the middle of an incredible adventure as they navigate their way through the Gringotts vaults

Harry
 Potter and the wizarding world created by J.K. Rowling continues to be a
 global phenomenon seven years after the last book was published.

Each of the seven books has broken numerous records, with the series having sold over 450million copies worldwide to date.

The Harry Potter films, produced by Warner Bros. Pictures, have grossed more than $7.7billion at box offices around the globe, making Harry Potter the largest-grossing film franchise in history.

Diagon Alley is not the only new attraction at the theme park, as Universal also recently finished building a replica of the Hogwarts Express, which will shuttle guests between the two parks. 

While riding the train, passengers are shown an amusing video that reflects the journey they are taking, depending on the direction they are travelling.

The scale of the attraction combined with the unbelievable attention to detail makes Diagon Alley one of the most immersive experiences on the planet.
