Millennials may not be getting jobs because they value their smart phone more than they value things like personal hygiene and body odor.

In data released on Monday by the Bank of America Trends in Consumer Mobility report, 1,000 adults were interviewed about how they value objects in their everyday lives.

Only 87 per cent said that deodorant was important to them compared to 93 per cent who said that a smartphone was important.

91 per cent said that toothbrushes were important.

Older adults cited deodorant and smartphones as equal in their everyday lives with the toothbrush ranking the highest importance at 95 per cent.

NBC interviewed Susan RoaAne, the author of How to Work a Room, a book that gives workforce hopefuls advice on how to land a job.

'If people can smell you before they see you, you aren't getting the job,' said RoAne.

Employees who let their personal hygiene slip after getting hired are also less likely to get promoted or get hired in a position that requires face to face contact with clients or CEOS.

To make things even more difficult for recent graduates, unemployment in the workforce is high.

The number of youths in the work force continues to drop and it may be because they don't wear deodorant or don't want to work

Older adults said that they cared about wearing deodorant just as much as they cared about using their smart phone

Data from May claims that unemployment among 25 to 34 year olds was 6.7 per cent.

Unemployment went up a bit from April where it slightly lower at 6.6 per cent.

Unemployment for those aged 20-24 is 11.1 per cent which is up from 10.6 per cent.

Unemployment for all adults aged 20 and older is 5.8 per cent.

Even though deodorant may keep the younger generation from entering the workforce, some evidence suggests thatÂ  millennials don't even really want jobs.

Steve Toback, the managing partner of Invisor Consulting, told NBC that millennials have their own version of entrepreneurship where they don't even need to leave their 'parents basement.'

'What entrepreneurialism is for many of them is hanging out in their parents' basement or their childhood bedroom with their smartphone, calling themselves the CEO of this one-person company,' said Tobak.

'It's sad, but you don't need personal hygiene when you're the only person in the business.'

Toback says that even while starting a business is admirable, getting some experience working for another company before starting one's own is a good idea.

'Experience is the best teacher,' said Toback.

'But buy some deodorant before you get out there.'
