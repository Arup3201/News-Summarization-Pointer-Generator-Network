Challenger? Liz Kendall, a favourite of Labour's Blairite wing, is widely tipped as a future Labour leader if Ed Miliband slumps to defeat in May

Blairite MP Liz Kendall is being widely tipped as a future Labour leader if Ed Miliband slumps to defeat in May, it emerged yesterday.

The Leicester West MP is a member of a ‘breakfast club’ quartet of frontbenchers along with shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna, shadow housing minister Emma Reynolds, and shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt.

All four were elected in 2010 and have been meeting in Portcullis House before meetings of Mr Miliband’s shadow cabinet.

Many MPs from the 2010 intake are keen to move on from the Blair/Brown wars of the past if Labour doesn’t win in May.

A clean break from the past would see one of their number challenging for the leadership against several former ministers. Other challengers are likely to include Andy Burnham, the party’s shadow health secretary who made what was widely seen as the best speech at Labour conference last year.

Mr Burnham’s popularity among party members has surged on the back of his passionate campaign to protect the NHS from further privatisation.

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper is also widely seen as a potential candidate in the event of a Labour loss. Her husband, shadow chancellor Ed Balls, stood for the leadership in 2010 but lost heavily.

Yesterday the Independent on Sunday reported Miss Kendall, a Leicester MP, had emerged as the favourite among Blairites impressed by her TV performances. 

It was also suggested that the quartet of Blairites will unite to try and block Mr Burnham, and suggested Mr Umunna would also be a likely candidate.

Other Labour MPs are said to prefer the prospect of a joint ticket involving Mr Hunt and shadow work and pensions secretary Rachel Reeves.

Last week Miss Kendall raised eyebrows by challenging Mr Miliband’s position on the private sector providing free NHS services, declaring: ‘What matters is what works’.

Her tone was markedly different from that of both Mr Miliband and Labour health spokesman Andy Burnham. Miss Kendall, 43, also defended middle-class voters with ‘sharp elbows’ who demand the best from public services.

She said: ‘I don’t think there’s anything wrong with making sure that our NHS needs to meet the needs and demands of middle class people or anybody else.’

Mr Miliband has accused the Government of ‘privatising and fragmenting the NHS’, while Mr Burnham has called for a moratorium on new contracts being signed.

But in an interview with political magazine The House, Miss Kendall insisted: ‘There will remain a role for the private and voluntary sectors where they can add extra capacity to the NHS or challenges to the system. I believe what matters is what works.’
