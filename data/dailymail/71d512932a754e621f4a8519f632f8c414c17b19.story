These remarkable pictures show water crashing from a melting glacier 160 feet into the ocean at the Arctic Circle.

Tiny seagulls flitting around the frozen landscape and fishermen's trawlers dwarfed by gigantic icebergs emphasise the awe-inspiring scale of the scene.

The images were captured by Swedish photographer Hans Strand, 57, who took his life in his hands by exploring the extreme climate of the inhospitable north on a small ship.

'These pictures show sculptures made of ice and frozen time,' said Mr Strand. 'The ice in the glaciers and floating icebergs can be more than 100,000 years old.

'But nature is unpredictable and shooting inside an ice cave is of course extremely dangerous.

'I was almost killed once by a collapsing ice.

'However, this ice cave looked pretty stable, so I took a chance and worked fast when I was inside.'

Mr Strand covered more than 1,000 miles of ocean around Svalbard in Norway on a ship called the MS. Origo and took the incredible pictures at Austfonna glacier.

He hired the ship especially for a photographic workshop he was delivering to his students - taking further beautiful pictures during an expedition in Iceland and Greenland.

'I travelled to these northern latitudes because I am currently working on a book on the Arctic and I am also teaching workshops,' said Mr Strand.

'When I first went to Svalbard in 2004 there was plenty of sea ice around the islands during the summer.

'Today, eight years later, there is not a single ice floe - dramatic climate change is happening so fast that I have seen significant differences from year-to-year.

'Now you need to go as far north as the 82nd latitude to find sea ice.'
