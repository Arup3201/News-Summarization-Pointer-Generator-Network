Chris Eubank Jnr claims he will revel in Billy Joe Saunders' hatred of him when the pair finally meet at the ExCel on November 29.

The two middleweights have long been bitter rivals - while the build-up to the fight, which Saunders has put his European, Commonwealth and British titles on the line for, has been punctuated by a series of taunts, threats and accusations.

Eubank Jnr agrees that the fight's promotional tagline 'Bad Blood' is an apt description of their relationship, but claims he will use his opponent's emotions to his advantage.

'There definitely is bad blood on Billy Joe Saunders' part. I know that the guy genuinely hates me, which I happen to love because I know that he is going to be so emotional that he is going to make mistakes in the fight and I will capitalise on those mistakes,' he said.

'I think that will be a key to the fight. The other key will be me being too much for him in every aspect of boxing - strength, speed, skills smarts... I'm going to do things that he has never seen before. He is going to be overwhelmed and I will break his will.

Speaking alongside his father and former world middleweight champion Chris,  Eubank Jnr claims he is primed for the fight and cannot foresee Saunders going the distance with him.

'I'd be ready to fight tomorrow if I have to. I've had a great training camp, and everything's on track.

'I will stop him in 12 rounds, I don't pick a round - I never say when I will stop an opponent but I know for a fact that he won't last 12 rounds with me.'

Meanwhile, Eubank Snr called on his own experience of pre-fight mind games by publicly appealing for the referee to look after his son's opponent.

'I would ask the referees to be mindful of Billy Joe Saunders, because this man [Eubanks Jnr] is a very dangerous young man in the ring,' he said.

'These referees need to be mindful of him, because he's in danger. [Chris] being edgy for three weeks before the fight doesn't not spell a good night for Billy Joe Saunders,' he added.
