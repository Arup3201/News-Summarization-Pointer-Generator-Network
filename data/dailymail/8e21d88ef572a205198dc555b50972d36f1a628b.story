It may look identical to the spirograph patterns created by children - but in fact this incredible image shows the path of a space telescope.

It shows NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, which orbits our planet every 95 minutes, building up increasingly deeper views of the universe with every circuit.

Its wide-eyed Large Area Telescope (LAT) sweeps across the entire sky every three hours, capturing the highest-energy form of light -- gamma rays -- from sources across the universe.

This spirograph-like pattern shows the path of an orbiting telescope's field of view over the period of 51 months it spent in low Earth orbit observice a pulsar

Pulsars are neutron stars, the crushed cores of massive suns that 
destroyed themselves when they ran out of fuel, collapsed and exploded.

The blast simultaneously shattered the star and compressed its core into
a body as small as a city yet more massive than the sun.

The result is 
an object of incredible density, where a spoonful of matter weighs as 
much as a mountain on Earth.

Equally incredible is a pulsar's rapid 
spin, with typical rotation periods ranging from once every few seconds 
up to hundreds of times a second.

The amazing images were captured over the 51 months the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi gamma ray observatory was observing the Vela pulsar.

'The pattern reflects numerous motions of the spacecraft, including its 
orbit around Earth, the precession of its orbital plane, the manner in 
which the LAT nods north and south on alternate orbits, and more,' said Nasa.

Eric Charles, a physicist at the Kavli Institute for 
Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology and the SLAC National Accelerator 
Laboratory at Stanford University in California, has transformed data of a famous pulsar into a mesmerizing movie that visually encapsulates the spacecraft's complex motion.

The movie renders Vela's position in a fisheye perspective, where the
middle of the pattern corresponds to the central and most sensitive 
portion of the LAT's field of view.

'The pattern created in the Vela movie reflects numerous motions of the 
spacecraft,' says Nasa.

'The first is Fermi's 95-minute orbit around Earth, but 
there's another, subtler motion related to it.

'The orbit itself also 
rotates, a phenomenon called precession.

'Similar to the wobble of an 
unsteady top, Fermi's orbital plane makes a slow circuit around Earth 
every 54 days.'

The movement creates beautiful patterns over time as engineers tweak to position of the spacecraft

In order to capture the entire sky every two orbits, scientists 
deliberately nod the LAT in a repeating pattern from one orbit to the 
next.

It first looks north on one orbit, south on the next, and then 
north again.

An original spirograph set

Spirograph was a hugely popular children's toy in the 1970s and 70s.

It was developed by British engineer Denys Fisher and first sold in 1965.

The geometric drawing toy produces mathematical roulette curves of the variety technically known as hypotrochoids and epitrochoids.

It was able to create a huge range of different patterns when the 'wheels' used were changed, allowing an almost limitless number of variations.

A Spirograph consists of a set of plastic gears and other shapes such as rings, triangles, or straight bars.

There are several sizes of gears and shapes, and all edges have teeth to engage any other piece.

For instance, smaller gears fit inside the larger rings, but also can engage the outside of the rings so they rotate around the inside or along the outside edge of the rings.

Patterns created using the Spirograph

Every few weeks, the LAT deviates from this pattern to 
concentrate on particularly interesting targets, such as eruptions on 
the sun, brief but brilliant gamma-ray bursts associated with the birth 
of stellar-mass black holes, and outbursts from supermassive black holes
in distant galaxies.

The Vela movie captures one other Fermi 
motion.

The spacecraft rolls to keep the sun from shining on and warming
up the LAT's radiators, which regulate its temperature by bleeding 
excess heat into space.

The LAT's sensitivity to gamma rays is greatest in the center of its wide field of view and decreases toward the edge. LAT scientists regard the effective limit of the instrument's field of view to be 78.5 degrees (red circle) from its center
