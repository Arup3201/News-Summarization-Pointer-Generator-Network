Lancashire skipper Paul Horton has been suspended from the opening two matches of next year's NatWest t20 Blast after showing dissent to the umpires during this year's final against Birmingham Bears.

Horton was handed the punishment by the England and Wales Cricket Board's Cricket Discipline Commission (CDC) after being reported by the match officials for his actions during the August 23 clash at Edgbaston.

The 31-year-old batsman was visibly angry at being given out caught down the leg-side off the bowling of spinner Jeetan Patel for one in Lancashire's four-run defeat to Birmingham.

The penalty for the Level Two breach of the ECB's Discipline Code - showing serious dissent at an umpire's decision by word or action - is three penalty points, but the CDC deemed further action was necessary on this occasion and has handed Horton the two-match ban.

Horton, who has accepted the punishment, said: 'I apologise to the umpires for my actions. I realise that these were unacceptable, particularly given the high profile nature of the match, watched by millions around the world on TV and a full house at Edgbaston.

'As players we must be aware of our responsibilities as role models, none more so than the captain.'
