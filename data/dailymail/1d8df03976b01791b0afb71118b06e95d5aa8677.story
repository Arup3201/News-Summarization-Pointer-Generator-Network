A 911 call has revealed the heartbreaking moment Michael Jace's father-in-law told dispatchers the actor had called him to say he had shot dead the man's daughter.

Jace, who played a police officer on the TV series 'The Shield', had called his father-in-law to tell him about the deadly shooting and asked him to come for the couple's two children, the call shows.

In the three-minute call, April Jace's father tries to explain to the dispatcher what happened.

'My son-in-law called me, and (texted) me, and said come get the kids because he shot April, our daughter,' the caller, whose name was redacted from the audio, told a fire department dispatcher.

him, and he responds: 'God speed, please!'

His father-in-law had called 911 while 
driving to the couple's Los Angeles home. By then, police had already 
been notified of the shooting, according to the audio.

Michael Jace was arrested on May 19, and police have said he also called 911 directly to report that he had shot his wife. That 911 call has not been released.

Jace has been charged with murder but has not yet entered a plea.

Michael Jace's attorneys Jason Sias 
and Jamon Hicks did not comment on the content of the audio but noted 
that the case is relatively new and they were still investigating.

'We have the utmost concern for the Jace children,' Sias and Hicks wrote. 'Mr. Jace has a constitutional right to a defense. It remains extremely early and we are still in the fact-finding process.'

Police have not disclosed a possible motive for the shooting but previously said they were investigating whether it was prompted by financial difficulties or other marital problems.

Michael Jace had filed for bankruptcy in 2011 and had fallen behind on payments to creditors as recently as December.

The family of April Jace released a 
statement last week calling her death 'a senseless act of domestic 
violence.' The family said it was rallying around April Jace's three 
sons, who range in ages from 5 to 18.

In the statement released to the 
Associated Press by Biola University, where Ms Jace worked as a 
financial aid counselor, her family thanked supporters for their prayers
 and donations.

'Now, her youngest sons are left without a mother or a father to care for them,' the statement added.

'As the press dies down, these precious young boys will be left with ongoing reminders of their utterly tragic loss.

'We
 cannot reverse the senseless violence that resulted in April's death 
but we can invest in the lives of her innocent children that are paying 
the price for it,' the family wrote.

April
 Jace had two sons with her husband, both of whom were at home at the 
time of her killing. They were uninjured. Her oldest son was from a 
previous marriage.

Shortly before her husband called 911, police 
received calls from neighbors who heard shots being fired inside the 
property after hearing arguing.

Michael Jace also appeared on the show 'Southland' and had small roles in the movies 'Planet of the Apes,' 'Boogie Nights' and 'Forrest Gump'.

Jace, 51, could face 50 years to life in state prison if convicted.
