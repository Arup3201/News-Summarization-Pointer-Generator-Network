More than 300,000 tickets to the London 2012 Games were never sold, despite millions of people jamming official websites in the hope of witnessing sporting history.

A total of 263,824 tickets to Olympic competitions were never sold along with 55,455 tickets to the Paralympic Games, including thousands of tickets to the main Olympic Park in East London.

Olympics chiefs were today challenged to come clean about which events were not sold out and why sports fans were told to stay away when tens of thousands of seats remained empty.

TV viewers were furious when they saw empty seats in the early stages of the London Olympics. Here former PM Sir John Major and wife Norma are seen surrounded by spare chairs

The revelation is likely to provoke a furious response from those people who tried in vain to get tickets to what was billed as the greatest show on earth.

Around 1.2 million people - or two-thirds of applicants – were left empty-handed after the first round of ticket sales.

In the early stages of the Games there was a backlash when TV cameras showed banks of empty seats.

Eventually it was agreed that armed forces personnel drafted in to bolster security would be able to fill empty seats.

Appearing at the London Assembly today, 2012 chairman Lord Coe and chief executive Lord Deighton were accused of being ‘selective’ about the data about which events were not sold out.

It was suggested only people with ‘deep pockets’ were able to get tickets to the most coveted events because so few low-price seats were made available.

Lord Deighton insisted trying to draw up a ticketing strategy was of ‘mind-numbing complexity'.

He told the London Assembly: ‘We have so much data. You can come in and see it. You can go right through the database and see every ticket for every venue and at every price.’

Despite being hugely oversubscribed, some 284 tickets to the Olympic opening ceremony were not sold

In total, 263,824 tickets to the London Olympics went unsold to the UK public. It included 1,729 passes to visit the Olympic Park and 2,491 to climb the Orbit tower.

For the Paralympics, 55,455 tickets were never sold, including big sporting events, day passes and Orbit tickets.

Lord Deighton said: ‘The tickets that were not sold were tickets kept in contingency in the early days.’

Some 284 tickets were not sold for the Opening Ceremony out of a total of 104,149 that were available.

Lord Deighton said some passes were held back while the positioning of the cauldron was tested.

‘We wanted to make sure that nobody got burnt, so we needed to test those before we released them.’

Lord Deighton, who ran the Olympic organising committee, said the ticketing system was of 'mind-numbing complexity'

He added that ‘at very late notice, it may have been possible’ for someone to have bought those tickets.

London 2012 raised £659 million from ticket sales, exceeding its £500 million target, towards the £2billion it needed to raise from the private sector to stage the Games.

It sold 10.99 million tickets out of a total of 11.3 million available across the Olympics and Paralympics. This included 8.21 million tickets for the Olympics and 2.78 million for the Paralympics.

Liberal Democrat Assembly member Stephen Knight said: ‘Obtaining detailed information from Locog about the sale of tickets for the Games has been like pulling teeth. Having refused to publish ticket information before the Games started, it is only now trickling out selective information.’
