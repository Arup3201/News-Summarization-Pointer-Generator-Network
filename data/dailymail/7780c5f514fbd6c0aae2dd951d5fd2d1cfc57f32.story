Emergency plans are in place to evacuate UK diplomats and their families following a second day of violence in the Middle East.

Protests over an anti-Islam film saw the US embassy in Yemen stormed yesterday by a mob numbering in the thousands.

The unrest started with the murder of the American ambassador to Libya and has spread to Yemen, Iran, Egypt, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Algeria, Sudan, Morocco and Tunisia.

Worrying times: Protesters flee as police open fire into the air to disperse them outside the U.S. embassy in Sanaa

Trying to get in: Hundreds of Yemeni demonstrators stormed the U.S. embassy in Sanaa on Thursday in protest against a film they consider blasphemous to Islam

Security has been reviewed at British
embassies and consulates amid fears that extremists and Al Qaeda-linked
groups will try to fan the flames.

In Tehran, groups chanting anti-US 
and anti-Israel slogans staged a protest outside the Swiss embassy which
represents US interests in Iran.

Afghan President Hamid Karzai 
postponed a planned visit to Norway, fearing violence could erupt in his
country.

And in Iraq, demonstrations spread 
from Baghdad to the second city of Basra with the leader of one Islamist
militia warning the film ‘will put all American interests in danger’.

In Egypt, the Muslim Brotherhood has called for nationwide protests 
today to denounce the film.

Time for action: Yemeni protesters break windows of the U.S. embassy

The murder of Christopher Stevens, pictured, who died alongside three other US embassy officials, cannot be written off as an isolated incident

There were reports last night that 
the US had deployed drones to Libya to hunt down those responsible for 
the deaths of ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans 
in the US consulate at Benghazi on Tuesday.

Such a move would be seen as hugely 
provocative because similar methods targeting Al Qaeda and other terror 
suspects are said to have killed innocent civilians in Pakistan, 
Afghanistan and Yemen.

Libyan authorities said last night that they had made several arrests over the embassy outrage.

The US embassy compound in Yemen’s 
capital Sanaa was stormed by up to 5,000 protesters chanting ‘Death to 
America’ and angered by the American-made film portraying the Prophet 
Mohammed as an adulterous psychopath and fraud.

They breached the usually tight 
security around the embassy and reached the compound grounds but did not
enter the main building because Yemeni security forces drove them back.

Others held aloft banners declaring ‘Allah is Greatest’ while tyres 
blazed outside the compound and fanatics scaled the walls. At one point 
shots were fired.

Yemen is home to Al Qaeda’s most 
active branch and the US is the main foreign supporter of the Yemeni 
government’s counter- terrorism campaign.

Up to 70 were injured in a third day 
of protests yesterday at the US embassy in Cairo with some demonstrators
demanding the ambassador’s expulsion.

Police fired tear gas at crowds 
throwing stones.

Protest: Iranian demonstrators in Tehran burn the US flag during a protest against the film mocking Islam

Vocal: Up to 500 people protested in Tehran over the anti-Islam film made in the United States, chanting "Death to America!" and death to the movie's director

Thankful: The rally, near the Swiss embassy that handles US interests in the absence of US-Iran diplomatic ties, ended peacefully

Trouble spreading: Egyptian protesters throw stones next to a burning police car during clashes near the U.S. embassy in Cairo

Fearing the worst: An Egyptian protester protects himself during clashes near the U.S. embassy
