As the owner of some of the most talked about breasts in showbusiness, it's no surprise that This Morning presenter Holly Willoughby, 32, should take the crown for best cleavage of the year.

The mother of two can shake off any worries that she'll be overshadowed by new buxom Celebrity Juice co-presenter Kelly Brook as she takes the best cleavage crown for the second year running.

Willoughby is closely followed by curvy Carol Vorderman, 52, in second place and Cheryl Cole, 29, in third.

Breast in show: This Morning presented Holly Willougby takes the crown for best cleavage of the year

The annual celebration of all things breasts - National Cleavage Day -  has been running for 13 years and was coined as a 'fun celebration of cleavage, no matter what your size'.

Back in 2002 Wonderbra joined forces with Cosmopolitan magazine in South Africa to create the DD Day which is now celebrated worldwide on March 31st.

The official Wonderbra Cleavage Honours 
List 2013 is published today in recognition of 'outstanding services to 
cleavage' across the UK this year.

Wonderbra also polled 1,000 Brits to find out what constitutes the perfect cleavage.

They found over half (55 per cent) think the perfect length for a cleavage line is 5cm, and three quarters (76 per cent) think the perfect place for the cleavage to sit on the chest is 15cm from the chin to the start of the cleavage line.

Unsurprisingly, over half (58 per cent) think circular is the perfect breast shape to create the best cleavage.

The alternative Honours List  was 
chosen by the Cleavage Honours Committee, a panel of experts at original
 cleavage creators Wonderbra.

It has been an incredible year for British cleavage moments, with our homegrown talent shining on the global stage..

In
 addition to Holly, other major contributions to cleavage have been 
recognised including Welsh singing supremo Katherine Jenkins for her 
display at the Epsom Derby.

Wonderbra also specially honoured Coronation 
Street star Michelle Keegan in the official Cleavage Hall of Fame for 
2013.

A study commissioned to celebrate the day found that 40 per cent of women are Confident Cleavagers and show their cleavage on a daily basis, while just over a quarter (26 per cent) are Closet Cleavagers, rarely showing off their chest.

Just over a third (34 per cent) are Part-Time Cleavagers, showing off their cleavage at the weekends.

Martina Alexander from Wonderbra UK 
said: 'We wanted to have a bit of fun on this year's National Cleavage 
Day and to congratulate those who made the Wonderbra Cleavage Honours 
List 2013.

'We are proud to be the original cleavage creator and what 
better excuse for women to celebrate their unique assets than today!'
