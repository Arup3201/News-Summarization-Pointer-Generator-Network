She's a talented singer whose musical comeback has been welcomed with open arms but Pixie Lott is proving her worth as a model too.

The songstress, who is signed with Select Model Management, looks stunning as she lets her natural beauty shine in a new photoshoot for Pandora.

The jewellery giant is sponsoring Pixie's new album launch and to celebrate she's posed in a candid shoot wearing her favourite pieces from the range.

Natural beauty: Pixie Lott, 23, looks fresh-faced as she poses in a natural shoot to showcase Pandora's latest collection of stacking rings - the jewellery brand sponsored her latest album launch

Wearing barely a scrap of make-up, the 23-year-old star looks fresh-faced with her hair poker straight.

She looks casual but chic in a Breton-striped jumper and a selection of the brand's famous stacking rings.  

Last week, Pandora hosted an exclusive acoustic performance with Pixie Lott at their Flagship Marble Arch store on Oxford Street. 

Fast forward a week and the starlet head straight to V Festival this weekend where she took to the MTV stage and delighted the packed crowd by performing in a typically eye-catching and cheeky outfit.

Clearly excited about the weekend ahead, the star tweeted: ‘En route to @VFestival best weekend of the year Who's coming to see my set at 2.20pm on the MTV Stage? excited to watch @jtimberlake.’

Model behaviour: The 23-year-old is signed with Select Model Management, where her long-term boyfriend Oliver Cheshire is also on the books

She was joined there by long-term boyfriend Oliver Cheshire, who models for M&S and various other high fashion labels.

Despite being together for nearly a half a decade, Pixie recently admitted that the pair are in no rush to walk down the aisle.

The Mama Do singer told MailOnline: ‘Everyone’s different, everyone’s ready at different times. My sister got married last year so I feel like all that attention has been on her rather than pressure on me.

'There’s so much I want to do first and Oliver has things he’s doing in his career so while I want to get married and have babies in my lifetime, it’s not happening right now. I still have so much to focus on before that’.

Speaking about how her boyfriend plays a huge part in her music, Pixie told Look magazine: ‘He makes me so happy, but I’ve imagined what it would be like if we broke up - awful - and it inspired some of the ballads on the album, like Break Up Song.'
