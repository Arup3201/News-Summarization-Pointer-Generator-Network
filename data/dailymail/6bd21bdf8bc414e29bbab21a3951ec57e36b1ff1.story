An unknown buyer has shattered Manhattan real estate records with a recent purchase. 

Someone has plunked down a staggering $100.47million on a 10,923-square-foot penthouse apartment occupying the entire 89th and 90th floors of One57, the high-end skyscraper apartment building that overlooks Central Park. 

The sale makes it the first time anyone has spent over $100million on a singe-family residence in the city.

An unknown buyer has shattered Manhattan real estate records, plunking down $100.47million on a 10,923-square-foot penthouse apartment occupying the entire 89th and 90th floors of One57

It is the first time anyone has spent over $100million on a singe-family residence in the city

Luxury: The apartment is in the One57 tower, a 90-floor glass skyscraper

Designed by French architect Christian de Portzamparc, the space will offer luxury amenities like a full service spa, a screening room, private dining room, a full spa and even a pet wash room.

The billionaires behind fashion label Michael Kors, Lawrence Stroll and Silas Chou, have both signed contracts for $50 million full-floor apartments in the tower.

The building will offer stunning vistas but the enormous structure will block the view from other nearby luxury buildings, which are expected to see their prices fall.

In May, Forbes Magazine sent Morgan Brennan to get a look of the inside spaces in a build-out model at their Midtown sales office, and was guided around the model apartments by Director of Sales Dan Tubb. 

Location: It will be managed by the Park Hyatt hotel brand and overlooks Central Park

The gourmet kitchen features outward ventilation and two dishwashers for units of three bedrooms and above.

The kitchen, which comes in two possible finishes, also includes two 36-inch refrigerators, granite counter tops, extensive storage, and a full-sized wine cooler.

Some cabinets are not what they seem and pull out from the kitchen island to become stools.

One penthouse suite was sold for a record fee in excess of $90million - and the new owner hasn't even seen it yet.

The astronomical fee eclipses the $88million forked out by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev on a penthouse for his daughter last winter at 15 Central Park West.

It proves that while the economic situation may be precarious some still have deep enough pockets to splash out super properties.
