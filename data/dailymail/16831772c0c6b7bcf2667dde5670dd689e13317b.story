Of all the
 threads which entwine to make the Costa Rica fairy story one of the 
World Cup’s best ever, it is the sudden global recognition for their 
fabulous goalkeeper Keylor Navas which has everyone chattering.

‘He’s
 born in Mars or Venus or something,’ said midfielder Celso Borges. ‘One
 of the best in the world, an extraordinary man,’ said boss Jorge Luis 
Pinto. ‘The best keeper in Spain and the best keeper at this World Cup,’
 said Pinto’s assistant Paulo Wanchope.

The
 ability of Navas was no secret to those who follow football closely in 
Central America or Spain, where he plays for Levante, but word is 
spreading fast. AC Milan, Atletico Madrid and Napoli are circling, aware
 there is a £6.5million buy-out clause in the contract of the man voted 
La Liga’s top goalkeeper.

What a save! The 'keeper made a stunning stop to thwart Theofanis Gekas's penalty against Greece

His performances in Brazil — culminating in a save to thwart Greece’s Theofanis Gekas in a penalty shoot-out and clinch Costa Rica’s quarter-final date with Holland — make this seem like a bargain price.

‘It has taken him to centre stage,’ said Borges. ‘We knew it from the start. The secret was out. He deserves the attention. He’s a great person and he has given us so much. With his saves, we get second chances.’

As he was drenched in praise, Navas reacted with a modest shrug. He thanked God and dedicated the win to his family, before adding: ‘It was the dream of an entire country. We are so proud. I work in a humble way to do things for my team.’

There is, of course, more to Costa Rica than an exceptional goalkeeper, whose contract expires in 2015. There is Pinto’s attention to detail, the inspiration of Wanchope and Colombian sociologist Jamie Perozzo Garcia, who provides ‘emotional advice’ as psychiatrist Steve Peters did for England, with  different results.

Garcia 
spoke to Navas before the penalties against Greece. ‘He told me to fight
 for my children and make them proud,’ said the  27-year-old keeper. ‘I 
try to make my kids happy, so when they grow up they can look back and 
see a father who did important things for their country and tried to 
make history.’

There are gifted outfield players, and 
an admirable team ethic. Pinto claimed it was important many had been 
educated at university so they can better absorb his strategies. ‘They 
learn faster,’ said the boss.

Pinto knew he had goal-power in attack,
 with Bryan Ruiz, Joel Campbell and Christian Bolanos, and devoted his 
time to organising a solid defence, with three central defenders, wing 
backs and tireless midfielders Borges and Yeltsin Tejeda.

Time 
devoted to practising penalties was rewarded in Recife with five crisp 
spot-kicks. ‘It’s all about having no hesitation,’ said Borges, who 
scored the first. ‘We’ve been practising so much I knew where I was 
going to shoot. I’m not a stone. I feel a lot of things but I trusted my
 training.’

There is history, too, spurring on a nation keen to 
expand its football heritage. They reached the last 16 at Italia 90 when
 Borges’s father, Brazil-born Alexandre Guimaraes, was in the team. When
 they reached the World Cup in 2002 and 2006, he was manager.

On 
Sunday, as his son helped Costa Rica into the last eight for the first 
time, emotions got the better of Guimaraes. ‘He was crying in the 
stands,’ said Borges.

Goalkeeping coach Gabelo Conejo played at  
Italia 90, conceding only twice against Brazil, Sweden and Scotland, but
 injury forced him to miss the 4-1 defeat by the Czechs in the last 16.

‘We
 always talk about it with him,’ said Wanchope. ‘We are very proud of 
those players. So imagine how it feels now, to see the people on the 
streets celebrating. I remember Cameroon in 1990 but this is the best 
upset. The world will want Costa Rica to win.’
