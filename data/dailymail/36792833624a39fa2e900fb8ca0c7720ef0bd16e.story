A runaway teenager who had been missing for a month contacted his parents this week to come and get him.

Christian Roe, 15, of Auburn, Michigan, called his parents from Jacksonville, Florida, over 1,000 miles from where he lives, telling them he wanted to come home.

The young girl who ran away with him, 14-year-old Olivia Kean, is still missing.

Christian first made contact with his father around 10pm on Tuesday.

'He said he was safe, that he'd hurt his ankle, and that he was no longer with Olivia,' his mother, Kari Roe-LaFramboise, told Michigan Live. 

'He borrowed some lady's phone on the road so he could call and say he wanted to come home.'

Immediately, Christian's mother, her husband and Christian's father, Jay Roe, got in a car and began the long drive to Florida.

The three plan on meeting Christian at a Jacksonville bank on Thursday.

For his mother, it will be the end of a long and harrowing ordeal.

'No words are able to describe how horrible it's been,' she said. 

'To go from not being able to eat, breathe, or sleep, to being so sick over what could be happening, to being so mad you want to scream.' 

Authorities are hoping that once Christian is back with his parents he will be able to tell them where they can find Olivia. 

The two were last seen on October 15, and likely drove off in a 2002 Dodge Ram pickup truck that belongs to Olivia's family.

Neither of the teens are old enough to drive, and it is still uncertain how they were able to provide for themselves with no help for this long.

Now Olivia's mother, Katrina Kean, is making an open plea to her daughter in hopes that she will return.

'We can get through this together,' said the bereaved mother on Tuesday. 

'Some times, things seem worse than the they really are. Even less will happen if she decides on her own to come home. The whole town will celebrate your coming home safely and we all will finally breathe a sigh of relief.'

Katrina has also mentioned on a Facebook page she started in hopes of locating her daughter that the young girl has a serious medical condition that requires attention.

It would seem that Christian did not plan to runaway as he left with just the clothes he was wearing, while Olivia did pack some of her possessions.

She also brought along her black Chihuahua, Salsa.  

It is still not known what motivated the two to drive over 1,000 miles and leave their families.
