Senior Labour figures piled pressure on Ed Miliband over his row with British business last night, with one of the party’s biggest donors claiming it is ‘in danger of promoting communism’.

And in a separate attack, former minister Geoffrey Robinson accused his party’s leadership of a ‘terrible, neglectful’ attitude to its relations with captains of industry.

Mr Robinson, who worked in the Treasury as paymaster general alongside Mr Miliband, then an adviser to Gordon Brown, insisted: ‘The mood music is wrong. I don’t know how it’s happened but it needs to be corrected.’

He told the Daily Politics: ‘The policies are right; the mood music is wrong. They are still New Labour, all the policies, all the statements on business. If they [the shadow Cabinet] haven’t given that impression it’s a terrible, neglectful omission on their part.

‘We have got to engage. We are not anti-business, we are not anti-trade union. We are for both of them.’

Assem Allam, the Egyptian-born entrepreneur and owner of Hull City football club, who donated £110,000 to Labour as recently as last June, accused the party of treating successful businessmen as if ‘they should go away and die’.

‘I create wealth, exports and jobs. What’s wrong with that? Labour is promoting socialism – and they’re in danger of promoting communism,’ Dr Allam said.

Lord Noon, another prominent donor, who is now a Labour peer, criticised Ed Balls’ inability this week to recall a single business supporter’s name as well as Mr Miliband’s failure to mention the deficit in his conference speech last year.

‘I cringed when Ed Balls forgot the name of a business backer and Ed forgot whole paragraphs from his conference speech. It is very embarrassing,’ he said.

He suggested the Labour leader and the Shadow Chancellor should ‘eat almonds’ – said to improve memory – ‘every day so they remember things when they speak in public’.

Sir Charles Dunstone, founder of Carphone Warehouse and one of 63 business figures who signed a letter supporting Labour in 2005, said he was ‘frightened’ by the idea of the party winning May’s general election. The business community felt ‘isolated’ by Labour’s shift to the left, he warned.

‘As a business person I’m frightened of an environment where there isn’t sufficient emphasis put on growing the economy to grow tax receipts,’ he said.

‘It feels like we have gone back to old Labour and business people feel very detached from the party.’ 

Mr Miliband has announced a series of policies taking aim at what he calls capitalist ‘predators’ across a range of industries from energy suppliers to private landlords.

The latest row began at the weekend, when the Labour leader went to war with Boots chief executive Stefano Pessina after he expressed concern at the prospect of the party winning the election.

Labour criticised Mr Pessina as a tax avoider and raised allegations about the tax affairs of the chain, which has 2,500 stores and 70,000 staff in Britain. 

His stance appears to have backfired badly, prompting other business leaders to join a chorus of warnings about Labour’s plans. Mr Miliband was defiant last night, insisting the row had revealed ‘a truth about our country’.

‘It was five days which showed the two different paths for Britain. The Conservatives believe that when a few at the top succeed, the country succeeds,’ he said in an interview with the Western Morning News.

‘We think a country succeeds with an economy based on a different idea, that it is only when working people succeed that Britain succeeds.’

Mr Robinson said a warning from former M&S boss Lord Rose that Mr Miliband is a ‘Seventies throwback’ who is ‘blowing apart’ Britain’s pro-business consensus in an article for the Daily Mail earlier this week was deeply worrying. 

Describing Lord Rose, who advised Mr Brown and is now a Conservative peer, as a ‘very good man’, he added: ‘If Stuart Rose can say that there is something obviously wrong with our communication with business.’

■ Ed Miliband has admitted that he will be hit by the mansion tax on his £2.7million home. The Labour leader whose four-bedroom home North London has risen in value by £1.1million since it was bought five years ago, said he would be ‘very happy’ to pay the controversial charge, which he has said will raise money for the NHS.
