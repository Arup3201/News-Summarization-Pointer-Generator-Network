A student who was just 15 when he had sex with his school's 23-year-old female security officer has said he is distraught that she did not receive prison time.

Patience Perez, now 24, was last week sentenced to two years in prison with all but seven months suspended - and the judge said she could remain free if she undergoes counseling.

She had sex with the teenager, who has not been named, before authorities say she tried to recruit him to kill her abusive husband. Charges relating to these claims were dropped.

'This has basically ruined me,' the boy told WTKR from his Virginia Beach, Virginia home on Tuesday. 'This has not physically hurt me, but mentally it's hurt me a lot.'

He said Perez saw him in the hallways at 
Renaissance Academy last March, approached him and gave him her 
telephone number and email address.

'Like any other teenager, you would think that you're the man,' he said. 'You got this older female that's giving you her contact information.'

He said they had sex and he thought it was just casual, but it turned into a month-long relationship.

She would often take him to her home after school and they would drink alcohol or smoke marijuana, he said. She also confirmed the claims in court documents, WTKR reported.

The boy said that Perez claimed about her husband, who was often away from home with his work as a sailor, was emotionally and physically abusive, and she joked about wanting him dead.

The affair came to a stop when the boy's mother discovered a nude photo of Perez on her son's phone and alerted authorities.

He said he was shocked that she was not locked up.

'If it was a dude, if it was an older man and a younger female about my age, that dude would be locked up for rest of his life,' he said.

He and his mother have now started a petition demanding Virginia judges hand out harsher sentences for such crimes.

The boy's mother also lashed out at the lenient sentence saying it was like 'an arrow to the heart'.

'We haven't wrapped our brain around it,' she said. 'It doesn't make sense. It's like we endured all this pain all this stress and for this to happen.'

In an earlier interview, the mother had claimed Perez 'preyed on my baby'.

'She took advantage of teenage boy that had depression issues, anger issues,' she said.

Perez left Norfolk County Court hand in hand with her husband, Gilbert, who stood by her after she was arrested last April.

Charges that Perez conspired with the teen to have him killed were dropped at an earlier hearing.

Facebook messages between the pair allegedly detailed the murder for hire plot, but police in Norfolk dropped the charges.

The judge told her she will have to register as a sex offender and stay away from her victim.

If she completes a counseling course she will not have to go to jail.

Perez still faces child sex charges in Virginia Beach and the victim's mum said she hopes that court will not be as lenient.

'I hope that that prosecutor cares more about my family than Norfolk did,' the boy's mother said.
