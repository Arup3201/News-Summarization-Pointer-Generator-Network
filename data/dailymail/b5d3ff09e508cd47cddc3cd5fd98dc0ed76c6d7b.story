Plans for an 80 seat restaurant at the 9/11 Memorial Museum have been scaled back in the wake of widespread criticism that it was crass and inappropriate to serve meals on the sacred site where so many had tragically lost their lives.

The café was originally billed as serving a ‘subdued, seasonal, mostly vegetarian menu’ and ‘New York-made draft beers and American wines on tap’, but will now serve only pastries, tea and coffee when it launches later this month.

Museum officials also confirmed that the mezzanine-level venue will now be simply named The Café, rather than The Pavilion Café, and will no longer have waiter service.

A museum representative declined to comment on the reason for the changes, but it follows a dearth of negative publicity that the concept generated when announced in May.

‘I can go for tomato soup and grilled cheese after staring at Picassos for a few hours. My appetite isn't the same after a tour through hell,’ wrote Steve Cuozzo in the New York Post.

Famed New York restaurateur and Shake Shack mastermind Danny Meyer remains in charge of the simplified offering.

He had previously denied that it is an inappropriate location for people to enjoy food and drink. ‘We’re not doing this for crass or commercial reasons,’ he protested in May.

The Cafe will open with about half of the 80 seats originally planned, although the rest will eventually be added. A portion of proceeds from the restaurant are going back to the museum.

The café was one of several controversies that surrounded the opening of the 9/11 Memorial.

The gift shop attached to the 9/11 Museum also provoked outrage after it emerged that it was selling items ranging from key chains to NYPD dog vests marketed off the tragedy.

Jewelry, mousepads, magnets, flags, pins, stuffed animals, cellphone cases, toy firetrucks and much more are all originally available for purchase, although some of the contentious items have been ditched. 

According to the museum's website, the proceeds benefit 'developing and sustaining' the memorial which is run by executives with privately-funded six-figure salaries. 

However the idea of a gift shop alone was offensive to many as thousands of unidentified remains of victims had recently been moved to a tomb beneath the museum.

'Here is essentially our tomb of the unknown. To sell baubles I find quite shocking and repugnant,' Diane Horning, who lost her 26-year-old son Matthew in the attacks, told the New York Post.

Matthew worked as a database administrator for Marsh & McLennan, an insurance firm which had offices in the North Tower of the World Trade Center. Matthew's remains were never recovered.

'I think it's a money-making venture to support inflated salaries, and they're willing to do it over my son's dead body,' Mrs Horning said.

Joe Daniels, the memorial and museum's CEO, makes $378,000 a year, though his and other executives' six-figure salaries are funded through private donations.

A private event on the eve of the museum opening also caused controversy.

Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg was one of dozens of guests accused of 'desecrating' the graves of 9/11 victims by 'drinking, eating and laughing' at a VIP-only opening party for the museum.

According to reports, some first responders, who were supposed to be able to tour the museum for free prior to its official opening, were turned away due to party preparations.

'They were drinking, eating and laughing when this is pretty much a grave-site,' a National September 11 Memorial & Museum employee, who asked not to be named, told the New York Daily News of the 60 or so partygoers.

'I don't think alcohol should be allowed in there. It's a sacred ground and they desecrated it.'

The worker, who also described the party's mood as 'festive,' said the information desk at the lower level of the museum acted as a makeshift bar from 6.30p.m. until 9.30p.m.
