Defence Secretary Michael Fallon (pictured) has revealed how the government is looking to step up defence in the UK in the event of an attack

The defence secretary has said rapid-reaction squads of special forces will be drafted in to help police tackle terrorist attacks in the UK.

Michael Fallon said yesterday that the military will help police to respond, particularly in rural areas where there are a limited number of armed police officers.

The plans aim to stop the threat from a ‘pop up’ Islamic State cell carrying out a Charlie Hebdo-style attack in the UK.

Mr Fallon said Britain needed ‘to do something about’ the spread of extremists, adding that special forces would be drafted in 'swiftly' in the event of an attack.

He said  a joint review by the Ministry of Defence and the Home Office is looking at where soldiers should be positioned in the event of a crisis in the UK.

They are also investigating how army helicopters could be used to move police around the country in the event of a Paris-style atrocity, he added.

Home Secretary Theresa May has previously admitted ‘stepping up’ security measures to tackle a Charlie Hebdo-style attack in Britain. 

Mr Fallon said: ‘We are facing Islamic state in Syria and it is on the borders of Europe, it is becoming a very direct threat to Europe. We need to do something about it.

‘I’m worried about the fight against Isil, I’m worried about this spread of Isil, this kind of pop up Isil which can link up very easily.’

Mr Fallon added that in the past the military's emergency response forces, which include Special Air Service and the Special Boat Service, were focused on events outside the UK. 

In January it emerged that ministers were examining plans to have ‘anti-terror’ batallions stationed across the country to respond to a terror attack within minutes.

‘It is really looking at where our troops are deployed around the UK,' he said. '[Before] most of our efforts were looking outwards - it was all about being ready to go, to leave the UK.'

‘It wasn’t really inward facing. We are now looking at how we defend the UK and how we help the police do that - how they are deployed and whether there is a role for them [the military] in supporting the police.’

His stark comments come just days after Londoner Mohammed Emwazi, 26, was unmasked as Jihadi John, the knife-wielding Islamic State fanatic.

When asked what the country was doing following the Paris attacks in which 17 people were killed, he said: ‘The Home Secretary has been looking at how you can deploy sufficient numbers of armed officers in areas outside London.

‘She’s discovered the Met has got lots of armed officers and some of the others like Manchester have, but there aren’t huge numbers of double crewed armed response vehicles in rural forces.

‘If they had an incident or two incidents or people fleeing from Manchester or London out to the countryside, do they really have enough armed officers to deal with that?

'And if three terrorists disappeared into a big forest, how would they deal with that? 

'You can see where they might call upon us.’ 

The search for the Charlie Hebdo gunmen in France was hampered when the murderers fled into a deep forest.  

It is understood defence chiefs will also look at the response times of the SAS, and how to move them even more quickly.

UK counter-terrorism officers have long been braced for an attack by marauding gunmen following the Mumbai attacks which left 166 people dead in November 2008.

Millions have been spent upgrading the heavy weaponry available to armed response teams and more officers have been trained - including a squad of 100 with automatic weapons within the British Transport Police.

The government has also bolstered overall security in Britain’s rural communities.

Security Minister James Brokenshire told MPs that specialist joint police, ambulance and fire teams were ‘in place with the capability to respond to terrorist attacks’.

He also said plans were in place to protect Britain’s ‘most critical infrastructure’ against terrorist threats, including reservoirs, sewage plants, communication masts and electrical substations.
