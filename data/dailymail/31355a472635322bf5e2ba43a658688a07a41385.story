Manchester City skipper Vincent Kompany and Liverpool’s flying winger Raheem Sterling are the two best value signings in the Premier League.

Kompany, 28, joined City from Hamburg for £6.7million in 2008, but after firmly establishing himself as one of the best central defenders in the world, the Belgian’s transfer value has substantially increased to £29m.

Liverpool’s teenage star Sterling, at the centre of an England controversy after manager Roy Hodgson revealed he was too tired to start against Estonia this week, has seen his transfer value rocket following a series of scintillating performances for the Anfield club since signing from QPR for just £500,000 in 2010 - the 19-year-old is now valued at £18m by German website transfermarkt.

Southampton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin is the next best value signing in the Premier League. The Frenchman was snapped up by the Saints for a bargain £1.2m but is now worth £17.6m. Tottenham were willing to pay big money to entice him to White Hart Lane over the summer, but the Saints refused to let him go.

Arsenal beat several Premier League rivals to lure Welsh dynamo Aaron Ramsey from Cardiff for £5m in 2008 after flying him to Switzerland for face-to-face talks with Arsene Wenger. The move worked and the midfielder is now worth £21m.
