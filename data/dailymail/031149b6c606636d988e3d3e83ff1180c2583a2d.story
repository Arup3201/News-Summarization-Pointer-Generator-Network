Every year about 1,000 people in the UK die due to the lack of transplant organs. This shortage is increasingly being addressed by so-called living donations, typically family members donating a kidney. But what happens if it goes wrong? Jason Douthwaite, 45, from Hemel Hempstead, Herts, received a kidney from his sister, Lynn, eight years ago, only for it to fail less than two years later. Here, he tells his story.

To be told I had kidney failure was a big shock. I wondered whether I'd ever work again (I run an air-conditioning business) and even if my wife might leave me.

Fortunately, Zoë has been incredibly supportive, but those things go through your mind. I'd become ill while on holiday in Goa with Zoë in 2005. I remember my urine being very dark, and feeling so dehydrated that I was unable to leave my room. And I was doubled over in pain. I thought it was due to drinking alcohol in the heat. A local doctor advised me to take a blood test when I got home.

I did this then had a call the next day from my GP who told me to go straight to hospital, making me panic. Being a smoker, I thought I had cancer. I'd never been seriously ill and was a healthy weight.

The diagnosis was acute renal failure brought about by IgA nephropathy, a condition in which the immune system damages the kidneys. Doctors aren't clear why this happens. I was told that my best option would be a transplant.

When my mother Delia, brother Vince, and sister Lynn found out, they immediately wanted to help.

They were tested for compatibility and only Lynn was a match. Lynn and I are pretty close. She used to be my bossy older sister. I didn't ask her to donate a kidney - she was adamant she wanted to.

Back then, they would only consider relatives or long-term friends, although that's changed - anyone who's suitable can become a living donor, but you have to prove people aren't getting paid.

Lynn's husband, Andrew, was very worried about her and I know he asked her if she was sure she was doing the right thing. The doctors said I'd need regular dialysis within three years without a transplant, but I deteriorated fast and needed it within six months. My kidney function plunged from 50 per cent to 10 per cent - classed as failure - in that time.

Dialysis is gruelling. I can lose three kilos of fluid in three hours - imagine doing that five times a week. I've seen a 30 stone body builder turn up for his first dialysis session in tears. By the time of the donation I felt tired all the time and used to vomit almost every morning due to the toxins in my system. Sometimes I couldn't get out of bed for two weeks.

We had the operations in August 2006 and the new kidney worked immediately. I felt great the next day. I was in pain from the surgery but my mind was clear. The level of toxins in my blood had fallen dramatically.

There was no reason to remove my failed kidneys, so I have three. Lynn was in a lot of pain afterwards, more so than me, because of the location of the kidneys, near the back. The kidney was put in at the front of my body, which is less intrusive.

It's hard to describe how grateful I felt to Lynn. It was so brave of her. She changed my life. There's no way to repay something like that.

People said the old Jason was back, and I got back the 20 hours a week I'd lost to dialysis. I felt well enough to start a family with Zoe, and we now have two boys,  William, five, and Charlie, three. I also have two grown-up sons from a previous relationship. 

Unfortunately, my body started rejecting Lynn's kidney after less than two years. I put on weight due to fluid building up because the kidney wasn't working properly. I had a reduced urine output and my blood pressure increased.

Live donations last on average 15 years so we were unfortunate. I was devastated for Lynn after the sacrifices she made. But she's never said she's had a problem with it.

During a hospital stay for treatment to try to extend the life of the kidney, I had a seizure and went into a coma for three weeks. I bit through my tongue and the blood wouldn't clot due to the anti-rejection drugs I was on. My tongue swelled up and blocked my airways and Zoe got a call in the early hours to say I'd be having an emergency tracheostomy - a hole cut in my throat to enable me to breathe.

They couldn't guarantee I'd survive the night. It was a slow recovery after that. I'd been fed through a tube in my nose and had to learn to eat again. My muscles were so weak I had to walk with a frame. I had to start dialysis again, which was depressing. I'm on the list for organ donation but there's no guarantee. The system for organ donations from people who have died should be changed to an opt-out system. The opt-in system sees many organs wasted.

My wife would like to donate a kidney to me but isn't a match. However, she might be able to donate to someone else via a pooling system. We'd get an organ back in exchange.

I'm getting on board with the idea but I'd much rather use a kidney that would otherwise be wasted than put Zoe through what Lynn endured.

Lynn Fitzgerald, 50, is a hairdresser who lives in Hemel Hempstead with her husband Andrew, their daughter Rebekah, 15, and her son Alex, 23, from a previous marriage.

As children, Jason and I didn't always get on. He once threw an ashtray at me and I threw a boot back. We were quite argumentative and each wanted the last word. But once I'd left home at 19 I became close to him and our brother Vince.

When I found out Jason was ill it was devastating. I visited him in hospital straight away. I remember crying a lot.

He deteriorated quickly - it was shocking. His colour changed completely; he went yellow. It was my idea to donate a kidney. When you see your brother that ill you don't need to think about it.I had to undergo tests for about a year before donating. Jason kept saying: 'You don't have to do this.' In the end I told him to shut up!

I was told beforehand you can live perfectly well with one kidney, but as part of the preparation I had to see a counsellor. I was asked to consider that if I was in a serious accident affecting the remaining kidney I'd have no back up. But I wanted to help Jason, not worry about things unlikely to happen.

My husband said he'd rather I didn't do it but didn't try to change my mind, and my children were a bit frightened. But we explained Uncle Jay was very poorly and what was going to happen.

On the day of the operation emotions were running high. When I was in theatre my husband panicked when it overran and had to be reassured by the nurses that I was coming back.

Jason and I were in the same wards throughout the procedure. Immediately after the operations our roles were reversed because he was sprightly and I was exhausted.

He sat on my bed because I couldn't move very well. I told him off when he made me laugh because it hurt. It was so good to see him well. We'd joke that he might start acting like me now that he had part of my body inside him, plucking his eyebrows or something.

Jason stayed in hospital a couple of days longer than me. The day I went home was emotional because we'd been together for about a week, which was the most time we had spent together since childhood.

After my operation I needed strong painkillers, then paracetamol. It was awkward for a while walking upstairs, getting in the shower and sleeping.

I've got quite a long scar on the left side, and I get a bit of numbness there. But I cope fine with one kidney.

When I heard that Jason's body was rejecting my kidney I was devastated for him - he'd just started to live a normal life. Poor Zoe was pregnant at the time, so it was very traumatic. I remember her saying to me: 'Obviously we can't save the kidney,' but I said: 'God, I'm not worried about that.'

We nearly lost Jason. He was annoyed and upset that his body rejected my kidney. He felt guilty. He kept saying that if he'd known, he wouldn't have let me donate. But I just wanted him to live.

I carry a Donor Card so other parts of my body can be used when I die. I only realised how important it is to donate when my brother's life was at stake.
