Fearless travel journalist Peter Guttman has released a new book of photos chronicling the extreme end of what the world can offer

His new book 'Extreme Adventure: A Photographic Exploration of Wild Experiences,' released this month from Skyhorse Publishing, describes itself as 'high-octane, eye-popping dream collection of global fantasies, all personally experienced and photographed by award-winning travel photographer Peter Guttman. Whether you are an intrepid traveler or strictly an armchair daydreamer, these photographs will whisk you away on dozens of excursions...'

Guttman's camera captures ice climbing in Colorado Ouray Gorge, canoeing through an alligator habitat in the everglades, and caravanning camels to a Saharan oasis, among other adventures. 

No stranger to exotic locals, Guttman was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award from the New York Travel Writers Society in 2013. 

Guttman has previously released collections on Christmas in America, night time scenes, and New England experiences among others.
