To commemorate St George's Day, the worlds of football and rugby have collided in a crossbar challenge between England stars of both sporting persuasions.

Arsenal winger Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Chelsea defender Gary Cahill pitted themselves against  Jack Nowell of Exeter Chiefs and Bath's George Ford at England Rugby's training centre in Pennyhill Park, Bagshot.

Oxlade-Chamberlain, who used to play scrum-half himself, impressed the rugby stars by taking a quick word of advice before 'nailing' his opening attempt at kicking a conversion - while Cahill seemed more concerned by wearing an oversized shirt.

Nowell did hit the crossbar with a nonchalant kick during practice and uploaded the evidence with an Instagram video and the caption 'Happy #stgeorgesday! To celebrate, @garyjcahill & @alexoxchamberlain took on @jacknowell & @george_fordy in a special cross-code challenge #englandconnected'

However, when the competition started proper it was his team-mate Ford who came closest with an effort that skimmed the bar.

Cahill's request to dedicate his kick to St George's Day was agreed to by Oxlade-Chamberlain, who said: 'You can do what you want, you're winning the league'.

The Blues centre-half duly fluffed his lines but enjoyed the experience enough to share his own Instagram picture of group, accompanied by the caption: “Happy S.George’s Day everyone! You can see me, @alexoxchamberlain @jacknowell & @george_fordy in a special Rugby v Football crossbar challenge , the video is on my Facebook page. #England #StGeorgesDay #TogetherforEngland #proud #RFU #ThreeLions #football #rugby #crossbarchallenge”

Gunners forward Oxlade-Chamberlain also admittedly 'let himself down' with a series of failed attempts much to the amusement of all those involved.
