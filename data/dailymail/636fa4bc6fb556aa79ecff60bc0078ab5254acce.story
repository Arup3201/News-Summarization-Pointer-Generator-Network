Professional boxer Clifton Mitchell has been sentenced to seven years in prison for the manslaughter of Leeds University student Jagdip Randhawa

A professional boxer who killed a talented young student with a single punch to the face on a drunken night out has been jailed for seven years.

Super middleweight Clifton Ty Mitchell, 21, hit Jagdip Randhawa, 19, with a jab to the chin during a row outside a Subway fast food restaurant in Leeds.

The blow knocked the victim unconscious and caused him to fall and hit his head on the concrete pavement.

Mr Randhawa - described as a 'brilliant student' and 'excellent sportsman' - was taken to Leeds General Infirmary with a fractured skull and bleeding from the brain.

He never regained consciousness and died five days later on October 17 last year.

Sentencing Mitchell for manslaughter at Leeds Crown Court Mr Justice Maddison order that his jail term be extended by three years because he is a dangerous offender.

'You have been a professional boxer and it is a great shame that you will not be able to maintain what was clearly a promising career,' the judge said.

'But, being a professional boxer, you have the strength and skill to cause serious harm with your bare fists.'

Mitchell, of Broadway Park Close, Derby, had a string of previous convictions for similar offences, including punching a woman in a nightclub, and knocking out a man in Derby city centre.

Mr Randhawa, who had been head boy at his school, was in his second year at Leeds University, where he was studying English and linguistics.

The 19-year-old was described in court as a 'gifted writer', who had ambitions of being a journalist after finishing his degree.

Mr Randhawa, from Hounslow, Middlesex, had been published at 17-years-old, the court heard.

Mr Randhawa's family wept in court as Mr Justice Maddison told Mitchell: 'You not only took his life but ruined the lives of those who loved him'.

The student's sister Majinda said her family had been left 'scarred for life'.

'Me and my mother are stricken by grief,' she said in a victim impact statement.

'His mother goes into his bedroom every day and cries.'

The jury was told that Mr Randhawa might have survived had be not been hooked up to faulty ventilation equipment at Leeds General Infirmary, which starved his brain of blood and oxygen.

Mitchell was visiting friends in Leeds on the night of the incident, and they had been drinking vodka and Red Bull in the city's Tiger Tiger nightclub before heading to the nearby Subway takeaway, where they encountered Mr Randhawa and his friends in the early hours of October 12 last year.

Prosecutor Peter Moulson QC said Mr Randhawa had been goaded into a fight by one of the defendant's friends Krishan Chauhan, 23, and who Mr Randhawa got the better of.

Mitchell was also spoiling for a fight with Mr Randhawa and the boxer punched him to the ground. The defendant and his friends then walked away, the court heard.

A security guard who witnessed the scene described the super middleweight's punch being delivered with 'lightning' speed.

Mr Randhawa was 'wobbly' but able to walk, and the two groups went their seperate ways, but encountered each other again soon afterwards.

Enraged Mitchell targeted his victim again shouting 'let's do it, let's do it', the court heard, before punching the 19-year-old in the face.

'This second and we say fatal punch was again delivered by the defendant, the professional boxer to Mr Randhawa's face,' Mr Moulson said.

Southpaw Mitchell used his right hand because his left had been injured in a boxing bout four days earlier, the court was told.

Witnesses described Mr Randhawa being hit ‘square on the chin’ and said his legs ‘went like jelly’.

His friend Gareth Donovan was also hit by Mitchell.

Mr Randhawa was taken by ambulance to Leeds General Infirmary, where he was linked up to a faulty ventilator for 46 minutes, the court was told.

This starved his brain of blood and oxygen, and contributed to his death five days later on October 17.

The jury found Mitchell not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter.

He was also found guilty of assault on Gareth Donovan.
