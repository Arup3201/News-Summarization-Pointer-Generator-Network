A California woman has become only the second person in the history of Wheel of Fortune to win a million dollar grand prize.

On Thursday night, Autumn Erhard of Laguna Niguel started her turn as a spinner of the big wheel with at least a little more luck than most: She’s 30 years old, it was the shows 30th anniversary, and it was May 30th.

But until May 30, only one of the show’s thousands of contestants since 1983 has ever successfully taken home such a huge sum.

Fortunate: Autumn Erhard became the second person to ever win a one million dollars on Wheel of Fortune on May 30

Why so rare? Quite a bit of luck goes in to taking home the Wheel of Fortune gold.

First, the contestant must be have the good fortune of landing on the million dollar prize wedge during game play and then correctly answer the subsequent question.

If they do, they get to hold on to the wedge. In this case, Erhard’s parents and fiancé did the honors.

If the player makes it through the rest of the game without hitting the ‘bankrupt’ wheel wedge and then beats the other two contestants to go on to the bonus round, then the usual $100,000 grand prize is replaced with the million dollar wedge.

Serendipity: Erhard's big historic win came during the long-running game show's 30th anniversary season

Historic: Erhard, seen here is her family wishing her luck and holding the game piece that let her spin for a million dollars, beat all odds to become only the second million dollar winner in Wheel of Fortune history

Erhard made it that far. She spun the bonus wheel and took an as yet unopened envelope--her future prize.

But it didn’t look like it was going to be hers at first.

She was left with only four letters revealed to help her solve the final puzzle.

That was even after she used a bonus letter she'd picked up over the course of the regular game.

'This looks challenging,' said longtime host Pat Sajak, before encouraging Erhard. 'Talk it out, you're a good player, you never know.'

But Erhard didn't need the encouragement.

Nor did she need to talk it out, as most contestants do in the final round.

In what feels like half a second, Erhard spits out her answer.

'Tough workout,' she said.

Vanna threw up her hands in astonishment and Sajak squawked 'WHAT!' and when the letter board lit up, she knew she'd won the game with impressive ease.

With a big smile, she waited as Sajak opened her prize envelope to reveal the largest cash prize the game has to offer.

'We have a million dollar winner,' Sajak said, showing the envelope's glittering contents to the camera and audience.

Great timing: Fiance Joey, right, works in construction--an industry hit hard by the global recession--but things will certainly be looking up for the couple after Autumn's big win

Happy couple: The couple's wedding is scheduled for July 2014, though they they already received the biggest gift they could possibly expect

The impressive feat was followed by a much deserved exaltation from Erhard and her thrilled family, including fiancé Joey.

‘No one could believe it,’ Erhard told WBMA of the big moment just before her family realized what had happened. ‘They were just off stage and couldn't see what my prize was. They were celebrating the fact that I solved the puzzle. They kept asking me how much I won, and I had to keep repeating it because no one believed me at first.’

The million dollar wedge was added to 
the bonus wheel in 2008. The first, and only other million dollar winner
 was Michelle Lowenstein in October of that year.

Domination: Erhard dominated throughout the game. Compared to her winnings, her competitors took home pennies: one got $2,000 while the other won $1000

Holder her breath: Erhard nearly blew it when only four letters showed up to help her solve the final puzzle

Amazing: Erhard solved the puzzle, 'Tough Workout' with only four letters and 'thing' as a clue, so quickly even game show veteran Vanna White could hardly believe it

Lowenstein had just gotten home from her honeymoon in 2008 when she was told she would be taping the show.

'I got home from my honeymoon on a Monday,' she told the New York Post. 'They called me on Wednesday and I taped the show that Friday.'

The New Jersey native was living in California with her new husband when she became the show's first millionaire. She and her husband met while working at a New Jersey Cheesecake Factory restaurant.

Her winning phrase was 'Leaky Faucet.'

Asked what she would do with all the dough, the then 24-year-old said she'd like to buy a car.

'And I'll help out my parents and my sister,' she said.

Lowenstein’s takehome of $1,026,080 in 
cash and prizes remained the highest in Wheel of Fortune history until 
now. Her record has now been bested by Erhard’s $1,030,340 in cash 
prizes, including trips to Belize and Arizona.

Beaten expectations: 'I am in complete and utter shock,' said Erhard, who'd gone on the show just hoping to solve a few puzzles and earn money for her upcoming wedding

Erhard is a sales representative for a veterinary pharmaceutical company and her fiancé works in construction. No word yet on how they’ll spend the money, by Erhard is likely still just trying to calm down from the initial thrill.

‘I wanted to have some fun and solve some puzzles, she said. 'I feel like I'm in a dream!’

Erhard said that, prior to the show, she was hoping to win some money to put towards her upcoming wedding. She certainly did that.

'I am in complete and utter shock,' she said.

Unbelievable: As her family gathered, Erhard said they were unaware how lucky she was, 'They were celebrating the fact that I solved the puzzle. They kept asking me how much I won'
