Closure: Stanbridge Earls School has announced it will close in December and another school is due to take over the site

Pupils at a school which is the focus of 'Lord of the Flies' abuse claims abseiled naked while teachers watched, it has been reported.

Stanbridge Earls School, which is currently embroiled in a police investigation into alleged sexual abuse of pupils, announced yesterday it will close in December and another school has been lined up to take over the site.

But today it was revealed that Ofsted inspectors carrying out emergency visits to the school were told three male pupils had been naked during a school trip to the Rua Fiola Island Exploration Centre in Oban.

Inspectors heard two female members of staff watched while the boys abseiled and allegedly took photographs of them during the May half-term trip.

The incident has been reported to police by the special needs school's headteacher Maggie McMurray, the Sunday Times reported.

The Department for Education confirmed the county council and police were investigating the situation at the school, where a 15-year-old girl was sexually abused by fellow pupils.

A spokesman said:  'We have just received advice from Ofsted following an inspection that took place last week.

'Ministers are studying that advice and will announce their decisions about regulatory action very soon.  It would be wrong to take any decisions until we have studied their findings, but all options remain open.'

The Charity Commission, the independent regulator of charities in England and Wales, has opened astatutory inquiry into Stanbridge Earls School.

A spokesman for the adventure centre told MailOnline that it had 'an unblemished record' for child protection in the 38 years it had been run as a family business.

'Considering the special needs nature of the school, our on-site instructor was looking for a lead from the two female members of the teaching staff who were present throughout this incident,' he added.

'While neither intervened, he saw his primary concern as being for the boys’ health and safety during the climb.

'This was an awkward and very regrettable incident but there was certainly no harm done to the children.

'We have however contacted the police about the incident to offer our full support on any follow up inquiries.

'We are also further clarifying our existing guidelines for our staff to ensure intervening action is taken should we ever see a repeat of an incident like this in future.'

On Friday Mrs McMurray wrote to parents announcing Stanbridge Earls' planned closure.

She said the school, in Hampshire, had 'for some considerable time now been experiencing many difficulties... most of which are a legacy of past events'. 

She said the school had seen a drop in numbers after a number of local authorities stopped placing pupils at the school, leading it into financial difficulties.

Ofsted was due to report on its findings following an 'unannounced inspection' last week, according to investigative news website Exaro.

The school's announcement comes as a major police investigation continues into allegations that a 15-year-old girl was raped and a 12-year-old girl stripped and sexually assaulted by male pupils.

Detectives are also investigating if the school perverted the course of justice, amid claims pupils were ordered not to report incidents to anyone outside the school.

The mother of the 15-year-old has compared behaviour at the school to the classic novel Lord of the Flies, by William Golding, in which children stranded on an island without adults torment each other with savage cruelty. 

'Financial difficulties': The headteacher said it had seen a drop in numbers after a number of local authorities stopped placing pupils there

Earlier this year a tribunal ruled that the school had discriminated against a pupil, who suffered 'appalling abuse' at the hands of another student.

It found a number of staff members 
failed to tell the youngster’s parents that she had complained of pain 
in an intimate part of her body.

And it said the school had been 'unsystematic, unprofessional, ad hoc and completely inadequate' when it came to protecting her.

The Special Educational Needs and 
Disability Tribunal awarded the girl's family £85,000 after ruling the 
school failed to respond properly to her allegations of sexual abuse by 
other boys at the school.

The
 tribunal was damning of the school’s then head teacher Peter Trythall, saying he 'failed to recognise that non-consensual sex is actually rape.'

Mr Trythall stepped down from his role in April this year and was replaced by Mrs McMurray.

Stanbridge
 Earls is an independent special school for 190 children with learning 
difficulties. It takes boarders aged 10 to 19, and charges between 
£25,000 and £39,000 a year.

One parent told Exaro: 'I hope that lessons can truly be learnt. We are delighted, although saddened, at the school’s closure.'

The new school is due to be a sister establishment to Gard'ner Memorial's More House School, in Surrey.
