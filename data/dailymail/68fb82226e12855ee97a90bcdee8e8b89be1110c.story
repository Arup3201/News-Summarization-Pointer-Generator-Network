A dangerous patient at maximum security Broadmoor Hospital was able to attack a nurse and leave her needing £8,000 of dental work.

Paranoid schizophrenic James Smith managed to knock over the nurse shattering her teeth despite being in the highest security unit and being subject to 'an incredibly high level of medication'.

Smith was flanked by two male members of staff, both holding his arms, as he appeared at Reading Crown Court, Berkshire, via a video link from the mental hospital charged with assault occasioning grievous bodily harm and three counts of assault by beating.

Dangerous: Paranoid schizophrenic James Smith punched a nurse just weeks after attacking other staff members despite being in Broadmoor Hospital's highest security unit

The court heard that the convicted burglar, who was transferred to Broadmoor in Berkshire after starting a fire at a hospital in London - had already launched three attacks on members of staff just weeks before he punched nurse Melisa McKintosh in the head knocking her out cold.

Miss McKintosh fell face first on to the ground and was left with serious damage to her teeth that needed £8,000 worth of work.

A judge ruled that Smith was not fit to stand trial so a jury decided on the evidence that he had carried out the attacks but did not rule whether he was criminally responsible for the offences.

Rubin Italia, defending, urged the judge not to move Smith.

He said: 'He is in a high-dependency unit, his progress has been minimal, if any, there are very high-levels of security surrounding Mr Smith at all times. He has electro-convulsive therapy regularly.'

Smith was told he would continue to be detained under the Mental Health Act at the hospital.

Judge John told Smith: 'The victims of each of these cases were staff at Broadmoor, where you have been detained since October 7, 2010.

'All the attacks were caught on CCTV, which we all saw in court. Even you were visibly upset by some of the footage.

'All four of these attacks were wholly unpredictable in their nature and took place despite you being very closely watched by staff and on some occasions when you were in seclusion.

'All these attacks were extremely sudden in their nature and the attack on Staff Nurse McKintosh was particularly violent and caused her great pain and injury.'

The judge added: 'My conclusion is that you are volatile, unpredictable and violent, despite what is described as the 'incredibly high level of medication on which you are maintained'.

'I'm satisfied it is necessary for the protection of the public from serious harm should you be set at large, that a restriction Order is set in place.'

He imposed a Section 41 Order, which removes the decision to release Smith from the hospital, and places it in the hands of an external Mental Health Review Tribunal.
