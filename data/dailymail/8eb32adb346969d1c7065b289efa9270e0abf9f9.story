Critically acclaimed fantasy writer and producer George R.R. Martin not only pitches television shows, he pitches at minor league baseball games.

The revered man celebrated the Game of Thrones season four finale by throwing the first pitch for his local minor league baseball team the Albuquerque Isotopes who played The New Orleans Zephyr's last Saturday night.

The Daily Dot reports that this sort of behavior isn't out of character for Martin who is a sports fan.

He roots for the New York Giants and the New York Jets and has even named Game of Thrones characters after New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick and a Dallas fan named Patrick St. Denis, who runs a fantasy website called Pat's Fantasy Hotlist.

One time when Denis won a sports bet, Martin promised to make him a character in one of his books and make him die a horrible death.

Though Martin is no professional athlete he manages to throw a pitch less cringe worthy than a death scene from Game of Thrones.

Martin throws then shrugs his shoulders as if to exclaim, 'I never said I was a pitcher'In order to show his baseball spirit, Martin wore a Mets cap and his finest pair of suspenders.Martin’s pitch was announced to the Game of Thrones iconic theme song and his title card read 'author/screenwriter.'

It doesn’t seem like he’ll be quitting his day job anytime soon.

After giving the pitch his best go, Martin gives a little shrug as if to say, 'I'm not an athlete'
