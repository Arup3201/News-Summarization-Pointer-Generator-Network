Lethal: Damien Fowkes tried to kill Soham murdererl Ian Huntley in Frankland Prison, Co Durham by slashing his throat with a makeshift knife

The prisoner who tried to kill Soham murderer Ian Huntley by slicing his throat with a makeshift knife was jailed for life today. 

Damien Fowkes, 36, was ordered to serve a
minimum of 20 years after he attacked Huntley with a weapon he made by melting a razor blade onto plastic cutlery, leaving the killer with a seven-inch gaping hole in his neck.

Fowkes, who is already serving a life sentence for a series of violent armed robberies, admitted at Hull Crown Court yesterday that he tried to kill Huntley at Frankland Prison, Co Durham in March last year.

He also admitted to the manslaughter of child killer Colin Hatch at Full Sutton Prison in February.

Fowkes spent weeks plotting the murder of 37-year-old Huntley and Hatch, 38, claiming he wanted to be 'notorious'.

Huntley was given a double life sentence, with a minimum term of 40 years, for the murder of schoolgirls Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells in 2002.

He had been working as a cleaner at the prison when the attack took place.

Fowkes waited until Huntley had finished his shift before slitting his throat with the makeshift 'shank'.

The
court heard that Huntley ran from his attacker, hiding in a room while 
he was stalked through the medical wing.

Fowkes managed to evade three 
prison officers before he was stopped.

Huntley, originally from Grimsby, Lincolnshire, sustained a large wound across his neck which required 21 stitches.

Following the attack, Fowkes said: 'I hope I have killed him. I have been planning it for weeks.

'I slit Huntley's throat for the crimes he has committed.'

Fowkes also went after child killer Colin Hatch, taking him hostage and strangled him inside a cell at the maximum-security Full Sutton prison, near York.

Hatch was serving life for the sex murder of seven-year-old Sean Williams in 1993.

He
told prison officers he 'hated' sex offenders and said: 'He doesn't 
deserve to live.

'They just do my head in. It was the same when I did 
Huntley.'

The 36-year-old has been described as
a psychopath with a personality disorder in three psychiatric reports.

He pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Hatch on the grounds of 
diminished responsibility and the attempted murder of Huntley.

Known as 'Dib-Dob' to friends, Fowkes is
currently serving a life sentence with a minimum 12-year tariff for a 
catalogue of violent knifepoint robberies in Northampton, which left his
victims terrified.

He was high on crack cocaine and £4,000 in debt to a drug dealer when he went on a violent spree with a 12-inch knife.

Head
of the Complex Casework Unit for the Crown Prosecution Service, Peter 
Mann said: 'There was clearly sufficient evidence to prove Fowkes had 
killed Colin Hatch and attempted to kill Ian Huntley.

'However,
after carefully considering psychiatric reports, it was clear that, at 
the time of killing Mr Hatch, Fowkes was suffering from an abnormality 
of mind.'

Speaking in court today, Mr Justice Coulson expressed concern about the attacks within high-security prisons, especially in the light of a further death of a prisoner at Frankland in recent days.

He said: 'It is troubling that these two attacks were carried out in two different high-security prisons.

'I am particularly concerned that the killing of Hatch took place with prison officers outside the cell but apparently powerless to save him.

The judge said that the 'notoriety' of the two victims had no bearing on the sentence.

A judge has called for an urgent review of systems at high-security prisons.

Mr Justice Coulson made his comments after sentencing Damien Fowkes, 36, to life in prison for the attempted murder of Soham killer Ian Huntley and the manslaughter of child killer Colin Hatch.

Today, the judge expressed his concerns following the death of another prisoner at Frankland in Co Durham. Child rapist Mitchell Harrison, 23, was killed at the weekend.

He said: 'It is troubling that these two attacks were carried out in two different high-security prisons.

'While everyone is acutely aware of the costs of monitoring vulnerable and high-risk prisoners, from what I have seen in this case it appears that the management systems currently in place require urgent review.'

The judge heard yesterday that it was Huntley's 'good fortune' that the 7-inch wound Fowkes inflicted with a razor melted on to a piece of plastic cutlery missed vital parts of his body.

He added: 'Whilst I am aware that the view has been expressed in some parts of the press that the killing of Colin Hatch and the attempted murder of Ian Huntley were somehow lesser offences - deserving lesser sentences - because of the crimes that they had themselves committed, such a view is manifestly wrong, both as a matter of common sense and as a matter of law.

'For the avoidance of doubt, can I stress that that would be so whether the Human Rights Act were in force or not.'

The court has already heard that sending Fowkes to a secure mental hospital was not an option, partly because of 
the danger he would pose to others.

During
the trial, Fowkes spoke for the first time about his time in jail,  
claiming he has managed to give up drugs and had turned to Islam. 

In the email, signed Damien P Fowkes, HMP Wakefield, he wrote: 'I have been totally drug-free for over three years.

'It
is still possible to get drugs in prison but ''at a price'', and that 
price varies from dealer to dealer, from prison to prison, whether it be
money or ''favour owed''.

'There is not now and never has been any rehabilitation for drug users compatible with those on the outside.

'A
majority of prisoners either continue using whatever drugs they can 
get, or go ''cold-turkey'' without any support, which is what I had to 
do.'

Fowkes also revealed he has been studying Islam for the past five years.

He said: 'On my last appearance at court, I was not wearing a ''white beanie hat'', I was wearing a Muslim prayer cap, given to me by the Imam at Wakefield prison.

'I have been studying Islam for the past five years.'

As he left court, Fowkes shouted 'Allahu Akbar' - 'God is greatest'.

He also denied claims that he had threatened a mother and child at knifepoint during a robbery in Northampton in 2002, which eventually saw him locked up.

Fowkes maintained he was trying to rob the house of a known drug-dealer who was in bed at the time with his partner.

Fowkes, who now faces spending the rest of his life in jail, also revealed details of his day-to-day life in one of the most secure prisons in the country.

He said: 'I have now been in different high category prisons for over nine years and contrary to popular belief, it is not a ''cushy life''.

'I have spent most of that time locked in a single cell for 23 hours a day, without the ''luxury'' of Sky TV, and unless I was lucky enough to obtain a job, I was let out for one hour of recreation a day, which usually consisted of the gym or 'association', which takes place outside only when the weather is fine.

'For some periods I didn't even have access to a toilet, and had to rely on the officers having the time, and the inclination, to escort me.

'As for ''three square meals'', we get fed on a regular basis, whether the food is edible or not is a matter of opinion, and there is no choice for religious or ethnic prisoners.

'Most prisoners buy their own food from the prison canteen and unless you work or have regular money sent in, the allowance doesn't go that far.

'Phone calls and stamps are not free, nor is tobacco or soap.'

He also claimed: 'There are no qualified psychiatrists or psychologists inside the prison. There are no qualified counsellors and no qualified mental health staff.

'All the professionals come from outside and because of the high numbers of ''patients'', a prisoner is lucky to get a 20-minute session a week to talk to someone.'
