An artist who imagined a fight between Big Bird and the Cookie Monster found a way of making his dream reality - when he turned the characters into street fighters from the classic 80s video game.

Matt Crane, 34, from Utah, was so inspired by his teenage dreams of Sesame Street and Street Fighter characters that he created a line of merchandise based on the theme.

As well as creating the pictures, Mr Crane has also renamed the characters to give them hybrid Street Fighter and Sesame Street names.

Little Miss Piggy, now Piggy-Li, got her powers from Street Fighter Chun-Li

Taking inspiration from Street Fighter M.Bison, Mr Crane created Elmo Bison

Street Fighter Guile for example has been merged with Kermit - creating Gurmit.

Miss Piggy is now in fact Pig-Li a morphing of Miss Piggy and Chun-Li.

Street Fighter, also known as SF, was
 launched in 1987 in Japan by company Capcom but it was soon played on 
computer screens across the world.

In the game, each character has their own trademark fighting techniques.

Chun-Li for example is experienced in martial arts such as Capoeira and Taekwando.

Last year, to help finance the project, Mr Crane took to crowdfunding website Kickstarter and made $900 dollars more than
 the $1,000 he had hoped to raise with 118 people backing him.

He is now selling his artwork, Sesame Street Fighter, to fellow fans around the world.

Mr Crane said: 'I grew up in the 1980s so obviously I was a huge fan of Sesame Street as a kid.

'Then during the 90s, Street Fighter was an immensely popular game - it was something that everyone was into at the time.

'I always used to do sketches of the 
characters while I was in school and one day I mocked them together and 
the results were pretty awesome.

'I went on to study graphic design in college and it's what I do for a living now so I thought why not put the pictures on to everyday items like t-shirts and coffee mugs for people to buy.

'The response has been very flattering and I'm glad I have the opportunity to share my artwork with people around the world.'
