Cheaper farmland and proximity to population centres are fueling growth in Amish colonies in The Empire State, a study out of Pennsylvania shows.

The Amish, many of them from Ohio or Pennsylvania, have set up 10 new settlements in New York since 2010 - growth that doubles other states.

That population has grown by nearly a third in two years, to 13,000.

Amish communities are currently in 28 U.S. states, but more communities are popping up in New York over the last few years

The first New York Amish districts were established in the Conewango Valley in 1949, but in-migration slowed until about 10 years ago.

As recently as 1991, there were just 3,900 Amish in the state.

Elizabethtown College professor Don Kraybill, who directed the study, said the movement has been driven by productive and underpriced land.

Factors such as weather, growing season and congenial neighbours and local officials have also contributed to the population boom.

In the 1980s and 90s Kentucky played that role for the Amish, while more recently it was Wisconsin, Mr Kraybill said.

New York has lower land prices in rural areas than Pennsylvania and Ohio, states that together account for about half of the U.S. Amish population.

New York also has more areas of rural isolation, according to Mr Kraybill.'If you want to get away from the suburbs and the high-tech world, there are more places to hide in New York.'New York, Kentucky, Illinois and Kansas have experienced the largest net gain in Amish households since 2006, the study found.

The largest net losers were Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Delaware and Ohio, although states with large Amish populations can grow even if they lose households because existing families normally have many children.

The Amish emigrated to Pennsylvania from Switzerland and Germany about 300 years ago.

Today, the nationwide Amish population totals about 261,000. Nearly all descend from a group of about 5,000 a century ago.

While their Christian beliefs and practices can vary from settlement to settlement, or from church to church, they were defined for study purposes as people who use horse-and-buggy transportation, and speak a dialect of Pennsylvania German or Swiss German.

Mr Kraybill said: 'It's remarkable that a horse-and-buggy people like the Amish are thriving in the midst of high-tech, Twitter America.'

Some areas of concentrated Amish populations in Pennsylvania, including Lancaster County, have experienced overall residential and commercial growth that can leave little room for the Amish way of life, so they make the decision to hire a tractor-trailer and head for someplace more remote.

Large Amish families sometimes move into new areas to find farmland for the younger generations, while in other cases they are more motivated by a desire to preserve traditional aspects of their family life and to resolve disputes about church rules, said Karen Johnson-Weiner, an anthropology professor at the State University of New York at Potsdam.

Ms Johnson-Weiner, whose book on the state's Amish was published last year, said: 'The Amish moving to New York are going to be, for the most part, very conservative. That means they're not going to be so willing to compromise or fit in.'

The Amish have been involved in disputes in New York over zoning, construction practices and electronic filing of sales taxes, while some areas have capitalized on local Amish communities for tourism purposes.

Ms Johnson-Weiner said some new Amish arrivals are buying land that has not been farmed since the earlier decades of the 20th century.

'The families farming those farms are ready to retire and there aren't any young people ready to take the farm over, so you sell to the Amish,' she said. 'They're revitalising farming, I would say, in many of those areas.'

Mr Kraybill said Amish migration in general often consists of younger couples looking for cheaper farmland or new locations to set up small microenterprises. It can cost just a few thousand dollars to start manufacturing furniture or quilts, for example, he said.

Other Amish migrants can be multigenerational families moving together so they can afford to buy several adjacent farms at the same time.

Mr Kraybill said prime farmland in Lancaster County currently costs about $15,000 an acre, a daunting challenge for a young farmer, along with the expense of buying livestock and farm equipment. That makes land prices of $2,000 an acre in other states very attractive.

Pennsylvania had the nation's largest Amish population in the new survey, just over 61,000, with Ohio a close second, about 400 people behind. Indiana ranked third, 46,000, Wisconsin fourth, 16,000, and New York fifth.
