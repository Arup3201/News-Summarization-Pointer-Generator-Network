A Victorian man who was in the grip of an iced-fueled psychotic episode when he stabbed a police officer four times, could walk free from jail in just over a year for the horrific attack.

Damien Power, 24, was a passenger in his girlfriend's car on August 21 last year when in an ice-crazed rage he lifted the handbrake on it at high speed, sending it hurtling off the Midland Highway outside Geelong, Victoria.

The accident happened just moments before Senior Sergent David Reither arrived to help, only to be stabbed four times by Power as the officer walked to his car to try contact emergency services. He spent days in intensive care following the attack and has since returned to work but has not fully recovered physically and suffers psychological trauma.

Damien Power was sentenced to a minimum of two years jail in Victorian County Court for stabbing David Reither multiple times last year

Power, meanwhile, was sentenced to a minimum of two years jail in the Victorian County Court on Thursday for the attack, but because he has already served 301 days in custody, he could walk free in little over a year.

The stabbing happened just three days after the Grovedale man had threatened colleagues with a hunting knife at the Geelong cafe where he worked, and demanded police, who responded to the incident, shoot him. He was taken to a Geelong hospital for psychiatric treatment but released on the day of the stabbing.

In sentencing Victorian County Court Judge Gerard Mullaly said Power came from a good family and had a clean record but regularly consumed cannabis, ecstasy and magic mushrooms. He reacted dramatically to ice despite limited use, he said.

'What turned your otherwise unremarkable life into a disaster was your use of that scourge of a drug methamphetamines, or as it is widely known, ice," Judge Mullaly said on Thursday.

'Your rationality and your grip on reality fell away and you became quite disturbed. Your disastrous reaction to ice has seen you imprisoned and your life turned on its head, but it is Senior Sergeant David Reither who has suffered most acutely."

Sen Sgt Reither suffered massive internal bleeding that caused his left lung to collapse. Judge Mullaly said Power took full responsibility for his actions when his mental stability returned.

He said Power had worked on rehabilitation while in custody and had expressed profound remorse to his victim and family.
