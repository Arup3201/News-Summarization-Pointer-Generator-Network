Duck Dynasty star Alan Robertson has come to his homophobic father's defense in an impassioned speech, branding him a '21st Century prophet' who is being punished for speaking 'truths'.

Following in the footsteps of his father's religious rants, Alan, the oldest son of Phil Robertson, made the comments in an address at the Watchmen on the Wall conference in Washington D.C. last week.

He explained that the outcry at his father's December interview in GQ magazine - in which he likened homosexuality to 
bestiality - had not changed his views.

'It hasn't changed us one bit, who we are, what we believe and what we teach other people. And it won't,' he told the audience in a video of the speech.

Defense: Alan Robertson, son of Duck Dynasty patriarch Phil Robertson, defended his father in a speech last week and branded him a '21st Century prophet' for maintaining his beliefs despite outcry

In a bizarre move, he then compared his father to John the Baptist, saying the two men looked alike, lived similar lives and were both attacked for speaking the truth.

'My dad, Phil Robertson, has the heart and the mindset of a prophet… long hair, long beard, naturally camouflaged, he ate off the land and he pointed people to Christ,' Alan said, RadarOnline first reported.

'[John] also lost his head for speaking the truth in a culture that really wasn’t prepared to hear truth.

'And yet, you know what - that doesn't change dad's view at all. Prophets tend to not care about their public image, they tend to talk about judgment as if it’s real and they speak what God gives them to speak and that's what my dad does. He is in that sense a 21st Century prophet.'

In hot water: Robertson, 68, was briefly suspended from Duck Dynasty last December following an interview

Alan was a pastor for two decades before he went back into the family business making duck calls. He and his wife Lisa joined his parents and siblings on Duck Dynasty last year.

Despite A&E briefly dropping Phil Robertson from the show after the scandal in December, he has not kept quiet about his homophobic views.

Just last month, he was filmed giving an Easter Sunday sermon at Whites Ferry Road Church in his hometown of West Monroe, Louisiana on April 20, according to a video on YouTube.

In the footage, the 68-year-old expresses his anger at the outcry over his December interview.

'They were mad at me,' he tells the congregation in the video. 'You say, "why'd they get mad at you?" Cuz instead of acknowledging their sin, like you had better do, they railed against me for giving them the truth about their sins. Don't deceive yourselves.'

Rant: In an Easter Sunday sermon at his Louisiana church, Duck Dynasty patriarch Phil Robertson complained about the outrage against him following his homophobic comments last year

It emerged just five months after Robertson, a born-again Christian, gave the controversial GQ interview.

'Everything is blurred on what’s right and what's wrong. Sin becomes fine,' he said in the interview. 'Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there.

'Bestiality, sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men... Neither the adulterers, the idolaters, the male prostitutes, the homosexual offenders, the greedy, the drunkards, the slanderers, the swindlers - they won't inherit the kingdom of God.'

His homophobic comments also included such insights as: 'It seems like, to me, a vagina - as a man - would be more desirable than a man's anus.

'That's just me. I’m just thinking: There’s more there! She's got more to offer. I mean, come on, dudes! You know what I'm saying? But hey, sin: It's not logical, my man. It's just not logical.'

He also grouped homosexuals with terrorists, saying, 'We never, ever judge someone on who's going to heaven, hell. That's the Almighty's job. We just love 'em, give 'em the good news about Jesus - whether they're homosexuals, drunks, terrorists. We let God sort 'em out later, you see what I'm saying?'

After the interview emerged, Robertson was put on indefinite hiatus from Duck Dynasty.

While his removal was lauded by gay rights organizations, fans of the show denounced it as a violation of his right to free speech.

Conservative
 supporters included Sarah Palin, who wrote in a Facebook post: 'Free 
speech is an endangered species. Those intolerants' hatin' and taking on
 the Duck Dynasty patriarch for voicing his personal opinion are taking 
on all of us.'

A&E
 initially said his views were 'disappointing' but two weeks later, they
 announced that Robertson would be included when they began filming 
again in the new year.

Uncertain future: Duck Dynasty (the cast is pictured) has seen lower ratings since the tirade last year

'After discussions with the Robertson family, as well as consulting with numerous advocacy groups, A&E has decided to resume filming Duck Dynasty later this spring with the entire Robertson family,' the network said in a statement.

Robertson also released a public apology saying, in part: 'I would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me.

'We are all created by the Almighty and like Him, I love all of humanity. We would all be better off if we loved God and loved each other.'

Whether or not this latest rant will affect his position on the show - which has suffered falling ratings since the first tirade - has yet to be seen.

The show is scheduled to begin its sixth season on June 11.
