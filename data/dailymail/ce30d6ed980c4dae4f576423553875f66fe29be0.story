BMW is recalling more than 1.6million cars worldwide - amid fears over the safety of airbags in the vehicles.

The German car maker wants to replace passenger-side front airbags made by Takata Corp after warning the inflators could break apart during deployment and end up injuring passengers.

The recall affects 3 Series vehicles produced between May 1999 and August 2006 with some 189,000 having been sold in Britain alone.

BMW is still taking part in a regional recall requested by safety regulators in the US.

But the firm's spokesman Dave Buchko said it has now decided to recall all of the models from 2000 through to 2006 that are potentially affected by the issue.

The regional recall, requested in June by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, covered both passenger- and driver-side front air bags.

The recall is an extension of last year's recall of 240,000 cars globally for the same issue and overlaps with the regional recall.

Mr Buchko said: 'As a precaution, we just feel now that the right thing to do is just to bring them all in and replace the passenger-side air bag.'

The air bags were supplied by Japan's Takata, which has seen more than 12million vehicles recalled over the past five years for related issues.

BMW said it was not aware of any accidents or injuries related to the issue. The cars previously recalled are not part of this campaign.

In
 the latest recall, about 574,000 of the cars were sold in the United 
States, 450,000 in Germany and 189,000 in the United Kingdom.

Last year, BMW recalled 42,000 cars in the United States for this issue.

In
 addition, BMW said it has also recalled 26 Mini cars and one BMW i3 
from model year 2014 to replace Takata passenger-side air bags. These 
are not part of the larger recall.
