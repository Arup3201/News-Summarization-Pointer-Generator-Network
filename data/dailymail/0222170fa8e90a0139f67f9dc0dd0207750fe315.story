Jose Mourinho insists he has no fears for Diego Costa's fitness over the gruelling Christmas period, described by the Portuguese as an 'incredible marathon.'

Costa has struggled with troublesome hamstrings since he signed for Chelsea, an injury which Mourinho is confident is behind the striker.

Mourinho has been embroiled in an on-going row with Spain coach Vicente Del Bosque about how he has handled Costa during international breaks this year.

But Costa has worked with Chelsea physios during the past fortnight and Mourinho believes it has been the perfect preparation for them to play 12 games between now and New Years Day.

Mourinho said: 'I believe (this period has set him up for the rest of the season), but now we are going to have a period that is new for him. I believe the Christmas period for players doing it for the first time in their careers is more difficult.

'The English players, or those who have been here for many years, are more physically and mentally adapted and prepared to cope with the special incredible marathon of football we face. If you do it thinking, “I should be having Christmas with my family in Portugal, Brazil or France,” you can’t do it.

'If you do it with that perspective, then you can't do it because the mental aspect is the most important one. I think you have to do it happy, like I do. Happy.

'Would I like a Christmas in Portugal? Yes, but there is a lot of positive things.

'Give to the people what they want: the Boxing Day full of kids, ladies, families - people happy to have football.

'I think all you are doing if you feel it in a positive way, it makes you happy. If you're happy, it's not so difficult to do.'

The Chelsea boss added: 'Costa had a little holiday, with a Chelsea physio, for two weeks so even then he was working many hours per day with our physio. After that he came back, he keeps going in the right direction. We feel he's free of his old injury.

'We spoke yesterday about it. But we go match after match. Diego has four yellow cards. Am I going to protect him? No way. He plays. When he's fit, he plays.

'When he gets the fifth yellow card... I am not thinking about Sunderland, Newcastle or Stoke. I am thinking just about the next match. 

'We go match by match, but the way he trains and expresses himself in training, he has a free mind. He's free of fears at this moment. He's good at this moment.'
