It's fair to say that  Jose Mourinho has probably made more enemies than friends in the game, but new Barcelona manager Luis Enrique is not one of them.

The Chelsea boss has been singing his counterpart's praises after the friends met at a recent coaches summit hosted by Sir Alex Ferguson. Spanish daily Mundo Deportivo leads with the headline 'Friend Mou'.

Mourinho commented on the former Barcelona midfielder, by saying: 'I have a great affection for him. He is someone I admire and hopefully everything goes well' - while AS report him as saying: 'He was my favourite when I was with Barca'.

Following Spain's 1-0 defeat by France to a goal from new Chelsea signing Loic Remy in Thursday's international friendly, Mundo Deportivo claim la Roja are lacking a leader with Xavi and Andres Iniesta sidelined by injury.

Marca were more generous regarding Spain's return to international football after their disastrous World Cup, claiming they 'recovered the lost scent' - despite having only a single shot on target against  during the match.

AS claim that Manchester United keeper David de Gea was 'the revolution' during Spain's performance, while coach Vicente del Bosque admitted: 'We lacked understanding with Diego Costa’s play'. 

Elsewhere in Spain, former Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez has also been tipped to score on his debut for Real Madrid, having netted on his opening games for both Chivas and United.

And, Luis Suarez has shown he has lost none of his goal scoring instinct by scoring twice in a practice match for Barcelona B.
