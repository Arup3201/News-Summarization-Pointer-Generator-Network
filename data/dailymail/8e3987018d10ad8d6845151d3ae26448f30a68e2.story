A new study has revealed that children placed in childcare centres are more likely to develop hyperactive and aggressive behaviours than those who spend time in home care.

3200 children were monitored by researchers from the University of Adelaide.

The researches studied the children, who came from all over Australia,  following time they had spent in different types of care up to age three.

Their results, which were based on surveys filled out by parents and teachers, found the length of time spent in childcare centres was directly linked to increases in problem behaviours by the age of four or five.

Interestingly, children who spent more time in family day care or under the care of nannies did not show increased signs of problem behaviours.

University of Adelaide PhD student Angela Gialamas says children who spent time in childcare centres were more likely to be restless, easily distracted and aggressive towards others.

But they were also less likely to be anxious or depressed than children who did not attend childcare, Ms Gialamas said.

"These children were less likely to be reported by parents and teachers as being unhappy and withdrawn," she told reporters on Wednesday.

"That may relate to childcare centres having more same-aged peers than any other type of child care setting."

Ms Gialamas said further research was required to determine why children placed in childcare centres were more likely to develop problem behaviours.

More than 75 per cent of children surveyed had spent regular time in the care of someone other than their parents by the age of three.

The study was partly funded by a scholarship from Healthy Development Adelaide and the Channel 7 Children's Research Foundation.
