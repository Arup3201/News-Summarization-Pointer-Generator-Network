Celebrity journalist Kevin Sessums descended into the depths of his own drug and sex-crazed addictions after heady years of inhabiting the world of Hollywood stars and writing about it.

He interviewed Courtney Love while she was nude in her own bathtub.  While waiting for her to come downstairs, he had discovered a tiny box on a Buddhist shrine in her living room containing Kurt Cobain's pubic hair.

Anna Nicole Smith flew by him smelling like vomit after exiting the ladies room and returning to a Pulp Fiction party at Chasen's.

While Daniel Radcliffe confessed to the author that he had always been a 'fag hag'.

The naked truth: Celebrity journalist Kevin Sessums interviewed Courtney Love while she was nude in her own bathtub. He  discovered a tiny box on a Buddhist shrine in her living room containing Kurt Cobain's pubic hair

Passages: While Kevin didn't interview Oprah, the talk queen called Kevin in February 2012 to tell him she had read his first book, Mississippi Sissy and she was going to read parts of it to Sidney Poitier 

Name game: Sessums asked Oscar winner Jared Leto and his brother Shannon if they'd be adverse to being called queer because 'some of his straight friends have begun to define themselves as queer without it being a sexual term but a cultural one.' 'I don't think we'd care at all,' Jared responded. 'We certainly identify with people who are different'

Revelation: Sessums interviewed multi-talented actor Alan Cumming for dot429 in which the Broadway star told the journalist he was bisexual as well as being married to his sweetheart, Grant Shaffer

Hugh Jackman wished he had been around in the 1970s to experience the mattress room at Plato's Retreat in NYC because he loved the 'idea of animalistic chaos and following our desires…'

'My favorite play I studied in drama school was The Bacchae. It's about King Pentheus, who gets eaten alive by all the women in a kind of orgy', Jackman revealed.

From the heights of celebrity society, Sessums was thrust further into his own addictions while listening to intimate confessions of the stars.

Born in the Deep South, he lost both parents by the age of nine and was abused by a minister in the hometown of his grandparents in rural Mississippi at age thirteen.

Sessums, now 59, tells of his struggle to find his way out of his addictions, reclaim his own life and forgive himself after learning he was HIV positive.

He candidly explores his descent and destitution in the life he lived in the shadow of fame in his provocative and beautifully written new memoir, I Left it on the Mountain, published by St. Martin's Press.

During those intoxicating years of interviewing the stars, Sessums maintained a residence at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles and a loft in downtown Tribeca in New York.

Michael J. Fox discovered the magnitude of Sessums' sexual obsessions after he came upon a piece of paper the author accidentally left behind during an interview with every written word being sexual: 'P****. D***. C***. F***'. Daniel Radcliffe conceded he was a 'fag hag'

Sessums was one of a few celebrity interviewers who was treated like an insider by stars while writing for Andy Warhol's Interview, Vanity Fair in the 1990s, as well as later interviews for the Daily Beast, Allure and Parade.

Michael J. Fox discovered the magnitude of Sessums' sexual obsessions after discovering a piece of paper the author accidentally left behind during an interview with every written word being sexual: 'P****. D***. C***. F***'.

At an Oscar after-party in 1995, Tony Curtis was checking out Sessums and confessed that he once had a crush on Yul Brynner.

'I think that's why you're making me feel so odd. You kinda look like him. I haven't slept with a man in decades, but the night is young', Curtis told him.

Daniel Radcliffe, who became a star through the Harry Potter films, revealed how 'more collegial and camp and…well, let's face it: gay' – working in the theatre was versus making the Harry Potter films.

He said: 'For a lot of straight guys and I know I'm guilty of it sometimes. When you know a gay guy has a crush on you it is the most flattering thing.

'Yeah, I'm a fag hag, to use your term.

'I know I definitely caught it. Absolutely. My mom was a casting director and my dad was a literary agent and I was surrounded by gay men from a very young age. And I was the only boy in my class at school who had that kind of relationship with gay men.

'That's one thing Harry Potter has done if nothing else. It has restored the reputation of the English boarding school. It has made it something other than a hotbed of sexuality.'

Sessums smoked a joint with Heath Ledger in Prague and later told Ledger's wife, actress Michelle Williams about their shared experience. He thought it was cool the way they had watched the moon rise over the Vitava River in Prague while taking tokes and getting really stoned until Heath died of a drug overdose - and then it didn't seem so cool anymore.

Michelle thanked him for sharing that memory.

He had an intimate conversation with Diane Sawyer in her ABC World News office in New York in January 2010, while discussing a cover story for Parade magazine.

Sessums looked frayed from a night of sex and drug bingeing and Sawyer noticed.

Sessums asked Diane how so much travel covering breaking news stories affected her marriage with director/writer Mike Nichols, who died suddenly in November 2014.

'He loves – God bless him – seeing the story with me in it', she said. 'And he's excited to hear when I get home how it smelt 'n' felt. How hot it was. What it tasted like. So he loved seeing me stretched flat out'.

'Mike is a genius at helping you know who you are and helping you know what is real and what is not real in the world and keeping you aimed toward a North Star'.

'And I love the fact that this son and grandson of blazing Jewish intellectuals ends up with this Methodist girl from the South'.

After listening to so many stories from others, Sessum's life was on the line. He needed help. His drug and sex addiction was killing him -- the crystal meth, the cocaine and anonymous sex with male prostitutes from online sex services.

He learned that he might find forgiveness in a climb up Mount Kilimanjaro and emailed Martha Stewart knowing she had once made the climb.

Her words of advice were' 'Don't take the altitude for granted'.

He took Hemingway's words to heart in The Snows of Kilimanjaro: 'You can't die if you don't give up'.

But on reaching the top in 2006 he hadn't found the epiphany he was seeking.

'I looked out at the world below and all that I had left behind – my fear of death and yet my longing for it. I shivered in the unrelenting wind and heard that howl my heart had finally found. I turned and reached the summit'.

The mountain forgave him, but he still had further to go to forgive himself.

He would eventually find it after a spiritual pilgrimage on the Camino de Santiago de Compostela, more than 500 miles across northern Spain that pilgrims have walked for over two thousand years. 

That coupled with walking the deserted and lonely winter beaches of Provincetown at the outermost tip of Cape Cod.
