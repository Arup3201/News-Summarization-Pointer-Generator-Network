This is the terrifying moment a  Russian politician thought she was going to be burned alive when she was surrounded by masked men and covered in oil.

Irina Komissar, 31, the former official of internal politics and information in the city of Zaporozhye, south-eastern  Ukraine, had just stepped out of her car when she was suddenly approached by a group of men wearing balaclavas and army camouflage.

In their hands, they carried what appeared to be a flammable liquid.

Irina Komissar told police she feared she was going to be set alight when the thugs approached her with a bottle of what looked like a flammable liquid (pictured)

She told police: 'I thought they were going to pour it on me and set me alight. I was so terrified didn't even scream. I just didn't know what to say or do.'

Miss Komissar, who is visibly terrified, is then held while they cover her with the oil and tip a bag of feathers over her head.

Recording the whole incident on a mobile phone, they then left the scene and later posted the video online.

It was posted online with a note saying it was an example of the treatment politicians could expect when they followed the 'wrong path'.

The men, wearing balaclavas and camouflage overalls, grab her by the arms as she exits her car

They then pour the bottle of water over her head and shoulders as she struggles to wriggle free

A second man then dumps a bag of feathers on her head before they shout: 'Glory to the Ukraine'

The end of the incident, which was filmed by the perpetrators and later uploaded onto YouTube, shows the former politician standing by the car in shock

At the end of the video as the men leave they are heard shouting: 'Glory to the Ukraine'. 

They also warned her that next time the attack would be much more severe, and told the former Russian politician she needed to get out of town.

The video of the incident has gone viral after earlier videos showing masked men on several occasions grabbing politicians and throwing them in rubbish bins.
