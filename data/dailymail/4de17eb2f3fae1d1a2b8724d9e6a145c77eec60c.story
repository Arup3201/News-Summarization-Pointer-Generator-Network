The adult daughter of baby Gammy's father David has broken her silence, admitting she was responsible for whispers that the Farnells believed baby Gammy was dead.

In an interview published by local newspaper The Bunbury Mail, Jane Farnell said she had told friends the baby, who has Down Syndrome, had died because it was simpler than 'dragging them into all the confusion'.

'My parents never said Gammy had died, that came from me,' the newspaper quoted Ms Farnell saying.

Pattaramon Janbua, pictured here with surrogate child Gammy, has claimed she was asked to abort him and his twin sister Pipah seven months in to her pregnancy

'The only reason I told my friends that he had died was that it was easier than dragging them all into the confusion.'

'I thought it would be easier to say he had passed away and then have to explain it later on if he came home.'

Ms Farnell added that baby Gammy's twin sister, Pipah, was a happy little girl who only cried during teething.

She said that Mr Farnell, a convicted child sex offender had done a 'terrible thing' in the past, but she believed in the integrity of the child protection system.

Overnight Pattharamon Janbua claimed on Thai Rath News that David and Wendy Farnell asked her to abort both children when she was seven months pregnant.

Ms Janbua also said the agents and doctors caring for were aware that Gammy had Down Syndrome early into her pregnancy.

Furthermore, she said she used someone else's name and ID to register for surrogacy as she was only 19 when she made the agreement with an agency.

'It was the agent ... she said that they (the Farnells) wanted to abort both of the children'. Ms Janbua told the program, adding she broke down in tears when she received this news.

'She said that the parents had been very shocked and frightened... they were insisting on the abortion. I said I couldn't do that... cause I was seven months into the pregnancy already.'

Ms Janbua said she was then given the option to abort just one of the children - the one with a disability - though she still refused this as she believed she was too far into the pregnancy.

'They told me that the child would have to be injected with some drugs (or poison) to take his life and then be taken out by surgical process. Then the girl would go into the incubator right away ... these words have since then stayed in my head', Ms Janbua revealed.

In an interview with a Thai news program, she said David and Wendy Farnell knew months before she did that Gammy had Down Sydnrome

Also in her interview in Thailand, Ms Janbua said she believed doctors, agents and the Farnells knew about Gammy's Down Syndrome as early as four months into her pregnancy, but they did not notify her until she started having complications around seven months.

She said she was sent test results to her home throughout her pregnancy, telling her that her babies were healthy and neither had any disability, mental or otherwise.

'The agency, the doctors as well as the parents knew (about Gammy's Down Syndrome) already since the fourth month of the pregnancy', Ms Janbua claimed.

'I was getting sick and had to go and stay in the hospital ... around the seventh month of the pregnancy. That's when they told me. But before that they have never mentioned anything about it to me.'

In their first interview since the scandal broke, the Farnells said on Sunday night they would have asked the surrogate mother to terminate the pregnancy if they had known earlier on about Gammy's disability.

However they claimed they knew nothing about his condition until around the seven month mark.

Ms Janbua also said doctors and her surrogacy agents were aware of a condition she carried which may result in any baby being born with a disability, but they did not notify her

In Australia, laws on the terminations of pregnancies vary state to state, but in Western Australia - where the Farnells are from - the four month mark would still be considered a safe time to abort the children as it is legal to have an abortion during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy.

Ms Janbua, who already has two children of her own, also said she believed she was misled by the agents and doctors in charge of her, as they withheld information about a health condition she had.

When she underwent blood tests prior to carrying the embryo, they showed Ms Janbua had thalassemia, a common blood disorder that can cause stillbirth, a range of growth and learning disorders and heart failure.

'Nobody told me anything ...I asked the agency that if I had this disease ... would that mean that I should not get into pregnancy? They said that it was okay. The doctor said it was alright', she told the program.

'I didn't know that if you have thalassemia there will be great chances that your child will suffer from down-syndrome. If the doctor had told me ... probably I would not have gone through with the procedure.'

The Farnells, pictured here with Gammy's twin sister Pipah, have been at the centre of the surrogacy scandal after Ms Janbua claimed they left Gammy in Thailand because of his disability

Another twist raised by Ms Janbua was that she originally registered for surrogacy using the identity of her partner's brother's girlfriend, as she was three months shy of 20 years old at the time.

'The agency told that is was okay... that I could use somebody else's ID instead. I didn't know what they were using my name for... they just told me that they will need give this name to the clinic ... to register myself', she said.

Ms Janbua claimed she did this as she had little knowledge about the surrogacy process, and only changed her name on the forms after she had to sign documents at the embassy.
