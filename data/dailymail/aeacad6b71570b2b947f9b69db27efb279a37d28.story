Just moments after he'd been celebrating Jake Quickenden's 10-star performance in the live Bush Tucker Trial on Sunday, Jimmy Bullard was back in the thick of it.

Thinking he was immune from facing a challenge for at least another day, the former Wigan man was shocked when asked to take part in a bonus trial for an extra treat.

Reluctantly, the 36-year-old followed Quickenden's lead and faced the Critter Cube - part two.

A terrified looking Jimmy was told he would have to put his hand in a box of three snakes.

In reference to one of Bullard's previous tasks involving snakes, host Ant McPartlin joked: 'That last snake didn't like you...it's not the same snake.'

To which his partner-in-crime Declan Donelly quipped: 'But they've been talking to the other snake!'

Despite the luxury of having two attempts at the trial, Jimmy cried: 'This is a bad one for me. This is probably my worst nightmare. I'm not sure about this situation.'

But the former footballer bravely agreed to give it a go as he stepped into a glass cube where there stood a small box containing three pythons.

He proceeded to creep his hand through a tube into the box where he had to pick up six coloured tiles that were under the snakes.

Failing his first attempt, Bullard swallowed his fear and went back for more, this time completing the challenge with time to spare. 

By the looks of his celebrations it was as though he'd won the FA Cup, Premier League title and Champions League all in one go.
