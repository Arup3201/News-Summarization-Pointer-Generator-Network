When baseball bat-wielding robbers burst into his convenience store, shopkeeper Darius Adineh told them: 'If you want the money you'll have to come and get it.'

The Special Forces veteran and Kung Fu black belt decided he wasn't going to give up his takings - and chased the yobs out.

Darius, 44, moved to Britain in 1994 and has run the Premier Convenience Store in Little Hulton, Salford, Greater Manchester, for the last three years.

Attack: Darius was working alone in the store when the two masked raiders burst in

He had previously served in the Special Forces of the Iranian Army during the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s.

During his three years' service he received extensive military training and also became a black belt in Kung Fu, for which he still trains up to four times a week.

And he put his fighting skills to good use to confront the thugs who stormed into his shop on Thursday night.

Darius was working alone in the store when the two masked raiders burst in. They approached the counter and after also producing a hammer, demanded he hand them cash from the till.Â

I know how to defend myself and it's like second nature. I wasn't scared. They weren't expecting someone like me to be there. When they saw my reaction they were just shocked.'

He added: 'Me and my wife work 16 hours a day. I wasn't going to give up my hard-earned takings to some idiots. I don't feel brave, I was just protecting what's mine.'

Police are investigating the raid at 10.10pm on Thursday.
