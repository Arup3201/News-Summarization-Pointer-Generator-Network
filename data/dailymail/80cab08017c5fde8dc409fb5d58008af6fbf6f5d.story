Rapist: Palestinian Ali Aboalkassem, 29, raped a 32-year-old victim

An asylum seeker has been jailed for punching a woman to the ground and raping her in a historic park - after being freed while he awaited deportation.

Palestinian Ali Aboalkassem, 29, was arrested by the UK Border Agency a year ago after he entered Britain illegally in a bid to claim asylum.

But immigration officials released him back into society on bail while they made arrangements for him to be deported.

The attacker approached his 32-year-old victim as she walked through Parker’s Piece, in the middle of historic Cambridge, and asked her for a light for a cigarette, then offered her an alcoholic drink.

When she declined he grabbed her and dragged her off the path, silencing her screams with punches before raping her on the grass.

He then stole her mobile phone and fled, leaving the distressed woman to flag down a passing cyclist who called the police.

Aboalkassem’s DNA was later discovered on the victim and on a bottle of absinthe, which was recovered from the crime scene.

He admitted rape and was sentenced to six year in jail at Cambridge Crown Court and will be deported when he is released.

Det Inspector Karryann Beeby praised the victim for her bravery in giving evidence to the police adding that her life had 'been turned upside down' by the attack.

She said: 'This has been a traumatic experience for the victim and I’m pleased the offender has been brought to justice without the need for her to relive her ordeal at trial.

'She showed extreme bravery in giving a thorough account to police which helped identify her attacker.

'Aboalkassem is a dangerous man who targeted a lone woman as she was walking to work.

'Her life has been turned upside down by the attack, but I hope she will take some comfort from the fact he has been locked up and will be deported on completion of his sentence.'

The attack happened shortly after 6am on Tuesday, October 11, 2011 as the victim walked to work, Aboalkassem was arrested at a cafe in Mill Road just after midnight on Sunday, October 16.

Gail Adams, UK Border Agency regional director, said: 'Aboalkassem has been found guilty of an appalling attack, for which he is rightly behind bars. Our sympathies are with his victim.

'We seek to deport all foreign nationals who commit serious crimes and aim to return them at the earliest opportunity.

'Aboalkassem was arrested and detained by the UK Border Agency in March last year.

'However, there was no realistic prospect of an imminent removal from the UK and he was therefore released on immigration bail while his case was dealt with.

'He subsequently absconded and was being sought by the UK Border Agency at the time of his arrest by Cambridgeshire police.'

Bob Stewart criticised the Border Agency for allowing the rapist to be free - and also criticised the cost to the taxpayer for his six year sentence

Conservative MP for Beckenham, Bob Stewart, has slammed what he called the 'appalling' failure of the border agency.

He said: 'I am absolutely appalled by this case.

'It is clear this man should have been deported almost immediately once his asylum plea was rejected.

'This is a classic example of why we have to sort out the matter as soon as possible.

'It makes me blooming mad because the thing going through his victim's mind must have been that he might have killed her - she shouldn't have had to cope with this trauma.

'Now of course putting him in prison for six years is just going to cost us more money.

'This is exactly the sort of thing we need to stop happening.'

The politician has previously been outspoken over the Government's 'weakness' in their handling of attempts to deport hate cleric Abu Quatada.
