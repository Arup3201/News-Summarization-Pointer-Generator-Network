For millions of revelers it will be nearly impossible to get a cab on New Year’s Eve.

For those that choose to use a ride sharing app like Uber and manage to get a ride, they may be charged over seven times the normal amount of a cab fare.

'On busy nights with peak demand – like New Year’s Eve – we use surge pricing to get enough cars on the road and help ensure you always have a reliable ride,' writes Uber in a blog post.

Peak hours: According to Uber, those who wish to avoid hefty ride fees should request before midnight and after 2:30

According to Uber, those who wish to avoid hefty ride fees should request before midnight and after 2:30.

'On New Year’s Eve, everyone is looking for rides at exactly the same times. We expect the highest demand—and fares—between 12:30 and 2:30 AM. For the most affordable rides, request right when the ball drops at midnight or wait until later for prices to return to normal,' they wrote.

According to Business Insider, Uber will make roughly $100 million in revenue on New Year’s Eve.

Uber promises to notify customers of surge pricing in advance but that won’t make the price any less.

They encourage friends to split rides and carpool.

In New York, Paris & San Francisco, use UberPOOL and share your ride with another rider along the same route to save up to 50%.

Uber has also joined forces with MADD in a fight against drunk driving.
