Texas police searching for a missing woman and her two children discovered a stash house on Wednesday, crammed full with more than 100 suspected illegal immigrants.

The boarded up house in Houston was so full that the occupants were sitting on top of each other and were surrounded by trash bags filled with old clothing.

It is thought many of the 108 men and women found inside the 1,500sq ft home had been brought there under a human smuggling operation.

The discovery was made as police 
searched for a 24-year-old mother who had been reported missing along 
with her seven-year-old daughter and five-year-old son.

The woman's mother had contacted police after alleged people traffickers demanded more money before releasing the family, according to KHOU.

When
 police opened the door, they found a 'large, large group of people, 
some sitting on top of one another, very confined spaces,' John Cannon, 
of Houston Police Department said.

Many of those found inside the filthy home, which had deadbolt locks on the doors, were dressed only in their underwear and had no shoes, possibly to make it harder for them to escape.

Cannon
 said the officers called out the name of the missing woman, and she 
emerged with her two children. The three are said to be well.

At first, officers saw only a mattress on the floor and a refrigerator in an exterior room. It was when they went further into the house that they found 94 men, 15 women and the missing family.Â 

All 108 occupants, who were crammed into several small rooms, shared one bathroom, and there was no hot water.

Many of the women said they had been in the house for three or four days, Cannon said. One said she had been there for 15 days. All of them said they were hungry, thirsty and tired.

'It was just filth, very squalid-like conditions inside. Trash bags with clothing piled as high as you can see,' Cannon said.

'They were very surprised at the numbers of people inside. Some were just sitting on top of one another because there was just no room.'

Five men have been arrested in connection with the suspected stash house.

Houston police have handed the investigation over to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

ICE spokesman Greg Palmore said it has been five years since officials uncovered a house in the Houston area with this many people inside. In 2012, a house with 86 people was discovered, he said.

The men and women found in the most recent case were taken into custody and will be questioned and fed, Palmore said.

They were primarily from Guatemala, Mexico, Honduras and El Salvador, he said. A pregnant woman and a man who were inside the house have been taken to a hospital for unknown treatment.

Although Palmore said it was too early to say whether this was part of a human trafficking operation, he said it appeared to be that way.

Houston is about seven hours from the Mexican border, making it a popular route for immigrants, Palmore said.

'Houston is significant for the highway corridors that make up Houston, I-45 and I-10. With those two traffic corridors you can pan out anywhere in the United States,' Palmore said. 'And it's very easy to assimilate into the communities here.'

The home was found after Houston police were tipped off that the woman and children they were looking for may have been taken there.

Cannon said police set up surveillance points outside the house early Wednesday and pulled over a car with two men inside for a routine traffic stop when they saw them leaving the driveway.

Handguns and documents that suggested illegal activity were found in the car, leading police to detain the two men and enter the house, he said.

After the people were removed and a count began, three men attempted to flee on foot, Cannon said.

Those men have also been detained and are suspected of illegal activity as well. In addition, police found two coops with hundreds of chickens on the property that are part of an investigation into illegal cock-fighting, he said.

Police have not identified the suspects.
