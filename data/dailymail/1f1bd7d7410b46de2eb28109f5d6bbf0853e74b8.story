Accused: Frank Onyeachonam, 40, is accused of swindling more than £250,000 out of pensioners by telling them they had won the lottery and asking for 'activation fees'

A man swindled pensioners out of their life savings by telling them they had won millions of pounds on the lottery, a court has heard.

Frank Onyeachonam, 40, is said to have targeted elderly American victims with his scheme billed as a 'life-changing prize'.

Believing they had struck good fortune, victims were allegedly persuaded to pay a small fee to release their winnings.

But he then continued to request further 'modest sums' - amounting to more than £250,000, it is said.

Prosecutor Joel Smith told the Old Bailey in London: ‘By its very nature this type of fraud plays on the vulnerable and often elderly.

‘Indeed,
 the scam could be seen as doubly cruel - not only were some of the 
victims left to come to terms with the financial loss and the impact of 
being duped, but also with the fact that they had not, as they genuinely
 believed they had, won a life changing sum of money.’

Onyechonam, of east London, is accused of running the seven-year scam between 2005 and 2012, sending out letters to potential victims, describing the foreign prize they had supposedly won.

The pensioners were told to pay a modest sum to an 'agent' - Onyechonam - who would 'release' their winnings, the jury heard.

This money was then said to have been wired back to the UK.

Wire transfer payments were made to the UK with Onyeachonam’s late associate Carvin Ehirim receiving payments of £80,365.74.

Co-defendant Lawrencia Emenyonu, 38, is accused of laundering the victim’s cash through an adult vocational schooling company called Renciae, which she was director of.

Her partner Bernard Armah, 51, is said to have helped after stashing ‘large and unexplained’ sums of money from his wife in his personal account.

Emenyonu allegedly received £59,883.67 in 2012 and £25,167.73 during 2012.

Western Union payments totalling at least £256,000 can be attributed to the fraud but the total amount of loss is unknown.

Joyce Abbot, 80, was swindled out of £60,000 after receiving a letter to her house in Maine, US, telling her she had won £1,950,000 in an Australian lottery on 30 July 2010.

She was asked to ring an agent called ‘Jeff Lloyds’, said to be one of Onyeachonam’s pseudonyms, who claimed he would help her obtain her winnings if she paid ‘activation fees’.

The SIM card with ‘Jeff Lloyds’ number was found next to Onyeachonam’s bed when he was arrested, jurors heard.

Seattle resident David Vawter, 63, was informed he had won £2.8m in an Australian lottery, then asked to contact ‘Dr Jeff Lloyds’ who demanded a series of payments for fake taxes and administrative fees.

Once hooked, Onyeachonam bled up to £40,000 from Mr Vawter, who still owes over £20,000 to his parents and brother, the court heard.

There are 13 known victims of the fraud in America and one victim has been traced in England

Onyeachonam, of east London, denies conspiracy to defraud between January 2005 and December 2012.

Emenyonu and Armah, both of north London, deny money laundering for the same period of time.

The trial continues.
