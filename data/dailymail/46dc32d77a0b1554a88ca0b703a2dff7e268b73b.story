An immersive 3D booth could help engineers monitor the effects of earthquakes, or explore the most remote and inaccessible regions of the world.

Using 12 HD screens, researchers have created the VuePod to allow users to fly over, wander through, or hover above 3D environments that are otherwise difficult to visit.

And it could also be used to track the degradation of buildings and landscape over time.

Engineers at Brigham Young University in Utah have created a giant virtual reality screen (shown) that allows users to view an area over a particular time period, letting them see changes in the environment otherwise invisible to the human eye.  It uses lidar (laser radar) data to track changes in a particular locale

The VR system was created by engineers at Brigham Young University in Utah, led by civil engineering professor Dan Ames.

On the giant display, which measures 108ft (33 metres) across when the 12 screens are combined, images are controlled by a Wii remote that interacts with a Kinect-like Bluetooth device called SmartTrack.

And 3D glasses worn by the user create dizzying added dimensions.

'This is gold,' said fellow BYU civil engineering professor Dr Kevin Franke. 'This technology has the ability to revolutionise my job as an earthquake engineer.'

Earlier this week Samsung unveiled a video content app that will compliment its Gear VR virtual reality headset.

Milk VR will provide free, immersive, 360° content to users and will offer sports, music and even action videos.

The launch follows the release of Milk Video and Milk Music.

To use Samsung's Gear VR, users slip a Note 4 tablet into the headset to create a screen.

The concept was developed with Oculus, the VR firm bought by Facebook. 

The VuePod creates images using point data from aircraft equipped with lidar (laser-based radar).

The lidar scans the landscape and records millions of data points that are then viewed as an image on the VuePod.

Point data can also be created from stitched-together photographs taken by low-cost drones.

One set of data currently available for study in the VuePod captured a canyon area beneath a plateau in southern Idaho.

With 3D glasses and the Wii controller, a user can virtually drop down into the canyon from above, and then fly from one end to the other.

By combining two sets of data for the canyon, taken five years apart, the user can then spot changes in the natural landscape that are invisible to the human eye.

This same system could be used to spot the before and after effects of an earthquake.

The VuePod creates images using point data from aircraft equipped with lidar (laser-based radar). It could reveal the more 'invisible' effects of natural disasters like earthquakes. Pictured is a collapsed freeway in Oakland, California after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake

'Our eyes and our brains are so amazing; we need to take full advantage of them,' Dr Ames said.

'That's the value of this project: we're presenting more information for the human eyes to detect changes.'

In addition to natural change detection, the VuePod has the potential to assist in infrastructure monitoring, such as tracking how highways hold up - or slough and crack - over time and seeing the effect on buildings after severe weather or earthquakes.

While the VuePod is not the first immersive visualisation system, it may be one of the more cost-efficient built to date.

Some systems cost as much as £6.5 million ($10 million) to build and maintain, while BYU's VuePod just barely topped the £19,000 ($30,000) mark.

Dr Ames details how BYU was able to build such a powerful system for so little in a new paper published by the Journal of Computing in Civil Engineering.

'Our question has been: How can we make this technology accessible?' Dr Ames said.

'We're trying to determine the threshold for getting the most function at the most affordable cost.

'Ultimately, the goal is to take an expensive tool and make it cheaper for an everyday engineering firm to use.'

And although Dr Ames and his students have achieved that, they believe much more can be done.

'We want whoever reads this paper to be able to build a better system than we built,' he said.

Engineers from Utah have created a virtual reality screen called VuePod

@highlight

It uses 12 separate 55-inch HD TVs to give an immersive experience

@highlight

Using a Wii remote and 3D glasses, users can explore a particular area

@highlight

And it uses lidar (laser radar) data to track changes in these regions

@highlight

For example it can see how a canyon has changed over five years, or reveal the damage caused by earthquakes and other natural disasters
