An Illinois teenager who broke both legs after he slipped off a canyon ledge and fell 90 feet could face criminal charges, police said.

18-year-old Christopher J. Stewart was in Starved Rock State Park near Utica with a young woman and two 'highly intoxicated' men, according to Illinois Conservation Police Sgt Robert Frazier.

The NewsTribune reports that the Aurora teenager hopped a wooden railing and left a walkway before jumping down to the rim of Wildcat Canyon.

Once on the canyon's edge, he tried to knock pieces of ice off from the top of the waterfall before slipping and falling 90 feet into the canyon, Frazier said.

Utica firefighters responding to the incident carried Stewart out of the canyon on a board before Ottawa River Rescue ferried him across the river to a waiting ambulance.

The ambulance then brought the teenager to a Life Flight helicopter to be transported him to a hospital in Peoria.

As of Saturday morning, the teenager was reportedly in critical condition though a photo shared by a friend on Facebook show Stewart alert and sitting upright in a neck brace.

Deep freeze: The waterfall had frozen over, and Stewart went to the top of the frozen falls, before falling 90 feet

Aftermath: In addition to broken legs, Stewart had multiple fractures (pictured) to his arm along with other injuries that required transportation to a hospital in Peoria

Dangerous drop: Stewart had reportedly jumped a fence and was trying to break ice off the waterfall before he fell, as investigators say a charge of entering a restricted area is pending

Frazier says in addition to the two men, who were both intoxicated and over the age of 21, 19-year-old Kara Watkins from Aurora was charged with marijuana possession of less than 2.5 grams.

Stewart faces a pending charge for entering a restricted area. 

Conservation police say they are investigating additional charges against the individuals pending the results of toxicology reports.
