Top Gear star Jeremy Clarkson has revealed how Argentina allegedly told Chilean officials to stop the crew entering the country as they tried to flee from an angry mob upset over their car’s H982FKL number plate.

The 54-year-old BBC presenter claims the South American country tried to stop their quick getaway so that Clarkson – along with the show’s fellow stars Richard Hammond and James May – could be arrested.

However, Argentina’s plan was thwarted when the Chilean officials refused to succumb to the request – instead letting the crew into the country where they were able to safely fly back to the United Kingdom.

Argentine officials and newspapers took offence to Clarkson's number plate, which they said was a 'provocation' and a 'very big offence'. They claimed it was a reference to the the 1982 Falklands conflict

Clarkson said the number plate was a coincidence and was not meant as a reference to the Falklands War

The drama unfolded when the Top Gear convoy was attacked with rocks, sticks and pickaxe handles as it made its way through the country during filming for a special edition of the BBC motoring show.

Angry locals hounded the crew after the Porsche Clarkson was driving arrived into the country with the H982 FKL plates – which locals have claimed referred to the 1982 Falklands conflict.

Clarkson said he was forced to hide under a hotel room bed with his co-stars as an armed mob rampaged after them and shouted: ‘This is a mafia state, best you do as you're told'.

They were eventually forced to flee Argentina under police escort – three days earlier than planned - as the furious thugs tried to 'kill' them.

They faced a gruelling six-hour journey to the Chilean border in a collection of hired 4x4s, trucks and the three 'star' cars that the crew had planned to use in the ‘car football match’ for the show.

They eventually made it to a remote border post where there was not even a road, but a river, and boarded a tractor to cross the water into the neighbouring country.

The presenters' cars were left by the side of the road in Argentina before they fled across the border to Chile

The attack took place in Ushuaia, on the southern tip of Argentina. The crew later fled over the border to Chile

However, the presenter said it was at this point on Friday night that they faced difficulty crossing into Chile when the Argentinians ordered that they were stopped.

He told The Sun: ‘After they [the crew] crossed a river into Chile, they spoke to the local official who said his opposite number in Argentina called him and told him to chuck our guys out, back into Argentina.

‘Their plan was to then arrest the crew for entering the country illegally.

‘Luckily for us, we’re really popular in Chile and they love the British so the official refused. In fact his direct quote was, “I told them, f***k you!”.’

Clarkson described him as a ‘real hero’ and also praised the police officers who escorted the film crew safely into Chile.

However, he also accused the Argentinians of taking advantage of their visit for 'political capital' and said the violent protest was 'state-organised'.

‘The more I think about this, the more I’m convinced we were set up by the local government,’ he added.

The controversial number plate is not likely to be a private one and was attached to the car when the BBC received it for filming, a spokesman for the show said.

The H at the beginning of the plate represents the year in which it was produced - 1991.

FKL, the last three letters, represent where the vehicle was first registered. In this case it was Maidstone in Kent.

The numbers in between these characters are chosen at random by the DVLA.

Porsche confirmed today the car was not bought from them by producers at Top Gear, but from a private owner.

It is possible to transfer registration plates to a new vehicle for £80.

Plates beginning in NIQ or Q - Northern Ireland registered vehicles - cannot be transferred.

Motorists cannot transfer a registration plate if it will make the new car look younger. 

His comments come as it emerged that he may have broken driving laws by switching number plates on the grey 1991 Porsche.

Photographs show how the crew swapped the number plate from the controversial H982 FKL to H1 VAE after the abuse started.

However, the replacement plate is allegedly already licensed to another vehicle – a white 206 Porsche.

It means Clarkson could have breached driving regulations as the DVLA said it is an offence to drive a car ‘in this country or abroad’ under a plate other than the one assigned to the vehicle.

The Independent reported that the BBC planned to ask the Top Gear crew about the registration plate used but ‘not in an investigative way’.

Earlier, Clarkson took to Twitter to confirm that he, along with the rest of the Top Gear team, had not meant to cause offence with H982 FKL plate.

He wrote: 'The number plate WAS a coincidence when it was pointed out to us, we changed it.

'And these war veterans we upset. Mostly they were in their 20s. Do the maths.

'They threw us out for the political capital. Thousands chased crew to border. Someone could have been killed.

'This was not a jolly jape that went awry. For once, we did nothing wrong.

'We had planned a good ending for the show. But thanks to the government's foolishness, it's now even better.'

Clarkson was in South America filming for the next series of Top Gear with Richard Hammond and James May

April 2007 - Referring to a car made in Malaysia, he said it was built by 'jungle people who wear leaves as shoes'.

October 2009 - Claimed TV producers were obsessed with having 'black Muslim lesbians' on screen.

January 2012 - He compared synchronised swimming to the deaths of 23 Chinese cockle pickers in Morecambe Bay in 2004.

January 2012 - Clarkson mocked the clothing, trains and food in India, as he ridiculed the country's sanitation by driving a Jaguar fitted with a toilet through slums. The Indian High Commission in London formally complained to the BBC about the comments.

March 2013 - The presenter joked that a bridge with an Asian walking across it had a 'slope on it'. The BBC later apologised but said it was not aware of the racist term at the time. In July, Ofcom ruled Clarkson had deliberately used racist language, but the BBC did not take action against him.

April 2014 - He took to Twitter to introduce his new dog - a black terrier he named Didier Dogba after the Ivory Coast and Chelsea footballer, Didier Drogba.

May 2014 - Clarkson was caught in a clip reciting the rhyme: 'Eeny, meeny, miny, moe' before mumbling what sounded like 'catch a n***** by his toe'. Clarkson initially denied the incident but then backed down and said he was 'mortified' and 'horrified when he realised it 'did appear that I'd actually used the word I was trying to obscure'.
