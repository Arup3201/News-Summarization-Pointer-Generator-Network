Sending naked pictures to an ex-boyfriend's wife, bugging the boss' office and using company phones to send explicit 'sext' messages between colleagues are not activities often associated with America's highest level of law enforcement.

But the FBI has been rocked by a slew of lewd revelations over the behavior of its agents when they were supposed to have been fighting crime, according to a leaked internal report.

The bureau has been battling what its assistant chief branded a 'rash of sexting' that has spread through its offices, and has vowed to stamp it out.

'When you are given an FBI 
BlackBerry, it's for official use. It's not to text the woman in another
 office who you found attractive or to send a picture of yourself in a 
state of undress. That is not why we provide you an FBI BlackBerry,' FBI assistant director 
Candice Will told CNN this week.

The lurid details were revealed in confidential internal disciplinary report circulated to FBI employees as a way to reign in misconduct.

'We're hoping (that) getting the 
message out in the quarterlies is going to teach people, as well as 
their supervisors ... you can't do this stuff,' Ms Will added.

From 2010 to 2012, the FBI disciplined 1,045 workers for a variety of transgressions, according to the agency. Eighty-five were sacked.

The revelations include:

'Fidelity, Bravery, Integrity': More than 1,000 agents are struggling to keep up with the bureau motto

Others include an agent caught drink 
driving for the second time, another who used a lost or stolen credit 
card to buy petrol and another who was arrested for downloading child 
pornography.

The 
revelations are the result of a long-running investigation by CNN, which
 has uncovered a catalogue of other misdemeanors by FBI officials in the
 past few years.

In 2011, CNN first revealed a list of demeanors committed by agents.

Among the toughest punishments was for the agent who had the 
seven-month sexual relationship with a source. He was suspended for 40 
days.

Another employee drunkenly ‘exploited his FBI 
employment’ at a strip club by falsely claiming he was conducting an 
official investigation.
He was suspended for 30 days.

In another case a supervisor 
who viewed pornography in his office during work hours, while 'sexually 
satisfying himself' (so the file states) got a 35-day suspension.

And
 an employee in a ‘leadership position’ misused a government database to
 check on two friends who were exotic dancers and allowed them into an 
FBI office after hours was ordered to stay away from work for 23 days.

However, the FBI Association's Konrad Motyka was keen to point out that the  vast majority of the FBI's 36,000 employees act professionally, adding: 'It is important to note that the ratio of disciplinary issues among FBI
 agents are among the lowest in the federal government and private 
sector.'
