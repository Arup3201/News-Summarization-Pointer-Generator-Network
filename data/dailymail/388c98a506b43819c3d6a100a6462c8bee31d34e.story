Borussia Dortmund lifted themselves off the bottom of the Bundesliga with a 1-0 victory over Hoffenheim - their second league win in 11 matches.

Ilkay Gundogan's first-half header was enough to give the hosts a much-needed three points as they ended their barren run of form with a morale-boosting win. 

Jurgen Klopp made five changes to the team which lost to Frankfurt, with goalscorer Gundogan the main inclusion from these selections.

After a cagey opening period to the game it was Dortmund who took the lead in the 17th minute.

Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang's cross from the right-hand side was met with a fierce diving header from Gundogan, as the hosts got off to the perfect start at Signal Iduna Park.

The relief on Klopp's face was clear for all to see, as the Dortmund boss leapt into the air in pure relief and ecstasy at the same time.

The visitors looked to get a foothold back into the game immediately, and went close to doing just that on 37 minutes. 

Sven Schipplock had the goal at his mercy,  but the lone striker could only drag his shot well wide, spurning a golden opportunity for the visitors to get back on level terms.

The visitors made one change at the break with Anthony Modeste brought on to replace the less-than-impressive Schipplock, as they searched for an all-important equaliser.

Hoffenheim had the early momentum after the interval and would have got themselves level, if it wasn't for a crucial interception from Mats Hummels.

On 53 minutes Dortmund thought they had doubled their lead through Aubameyeng as he nodded home at the far post following an inswinging corner from Gundogan, with Klopp far from pleased at the decision to disallow the goal, seemingly for being in an offside position.

Unbelievably, the Gabon international was denied yet again by the offside flag on 72 minutes, as he drilled the ball home from close range, but yet again his goal was ruled out.

Luckily for the hosts a solitary goal was enough to hand them all three points, as the visitors huffed and puffed to no avail in the latter stages, as Klopp's side moved off the bottom of the table in the process.
