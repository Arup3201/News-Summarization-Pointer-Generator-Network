The sisters of the woman fatally shot in Washington DC last week after she went on a high-speed chase through the capital, insist she did nothing wrong.

Speaking on NBC's Today Show, Miriam Carey's sisters Amy Carey-Jones and Valarie Carey, wanted to make it clear that their sister was not under the delusion that President Barack Obama was 'communicating' with her, as one of her ex-boyfriends has said.

'She was not walking around delusional. which is what we really want the public to understand,' sister Valarie, a retired New York Police Department officer, said.

The sisters continue to question the police officers handling of their sister, since she was unarmed.

Mother lost: Miriam Carey was fatally shot last Thursday trying to flee from police in Washington DC. Her two-year-old daughter was in the car with her, and survived

'I feel that things could have been handled a lot differently,' Amy said. 'We still fell that there was maybe another story than what we're being told.'

When asked by Matt Lauer if they believe their sister was responsible for her death in any way, the sisters said no.

'What I do see is that perhaps maybe my sister was a little afraid being surrounded by officers with their guns drawn,' Valarie said. 'My sister was fleeing. She was trying to figure out how to get out of there.'

Miriam was killed on Thursday after she
slammed into a Capitol Hill barricade following a police chase and it 
was only after the officers approached the vehicle did they realize she 
had her young daughter in the backseat.

Witnesses say Miriam plowed 
through a temporary barrier and hit a Secret Service agent who was 
trying to wave her off - sending him flying onto the hood of her car.

The Secret Service opened fire on her car as she turned and fled.

Police pursued her through the streets of Capitol Hill during a frantic chase that hit speeds up to 80pmh.

footage shows the Capitol Police officers - who have not been paid 
since Tuesday because of the government shutdown - surrounded Miriam's 
car - guns drawn. At one point an officer even sticks his weapon inside 
her open passenger-side window.

But even being blocked in by cops didn't stop her, she wheels the car 
around, hitting a police cruiser and nearly striking several officers, 
and flees.

Officers can be heard shooting at her car as it drives off.

Moments later, Miriam was shot and killed - within sight of the Capitol Building, and just behind the U.S. Supreme Court. She was not armed.

Since
the shooting, police have revealed that Miriam suffered from post-partum
depression following the birth of her now-18-month-old daughter, whose 
name has not been released.

Investigation: A federal agent removes evidence from the apartment complex where Miriam Carey is believed to have lived in Stamford, Connecticut, this morning

After
searching Miriam's Stamford, Connecticut home, police found files 
confirming her former mental diagnosis, though the clearest reports come
from an interview with her sisters.

'My sister was not a bipolar schizophrenic individual. I can’t say as to why she was in DC.

Regardless as to why, she was in dc her life should not have ended there,' Valarie said.

Amy
described the medical issues as something that was carefully monitored 
by her doctors, who felt that she only needed to be on the medication 
for a year following the initial diagnosis given her lack of any prior 
issues.

'I just know that my sister did experience post-partum depression along with psychosis,' Amy said.

'She worked very closely with her doctor to taper her off the medication.

'It wasn’t something that was displayed- it was a momentary breakdown… She didn’t appear to be unstable.

And while security officials in Washington have so far supported the
actions of officers in the incident, it was announced yesterday that 
they would be investigating the use of force against Miriam.

Investigators
will study the car chase and shooting and look into whether police 
officers took the right steps in stopping Miriam's rampage, which briefly
put the U.S. Capitol on lock down.

So far, Senate Sergeant at Arms Terrance Gainer believes that the officers 'did the best they could under the situation.'

Sgt Gainer says officers working at high-target buildings must make quick decisions to confront threats.

'This
is not a routine highway or city traffic stop. It is simply not that,' 
Gainer said yesterday. 'The milieu under which we're operating at the 
United States Capitol and I suspect at the White House and at icons up 
in New York is an anti-terrorism approach, and that is a difference with
a huge, huge distinction.'

Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine was 
also happy with the way his officers acted under pressure, saying they 
were 'heroic' defending the Capitol.

The biggest question- why 
she did it- will be one that remains with family members for the rest of
their lives as Valerie said that 'she was a law-abiding citizen. 
She had no political agenda'.

'We will never know what Miriam was thinking in those last hours before she died. We can only speculate,' sister Amy said.

Searching for answers: The sisters have said that they are awaiting the results of the investigation into the use of deadly force, saying that there should have been another way to stop Miriam during her car chase

Heartbreaking: Amy said that they spoke regularly and she knew that Miriam had been working closely with her doctors about tapering off the medication the prescribed for her post-partum depression
