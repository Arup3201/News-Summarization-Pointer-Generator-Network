There are a lot of snobs in football who look down their noses at players like Lee Cattermole. Against Chelsea, the Sunderland man was magnificent.

I spoke to Gus Poyet on Sky’s Saturday Night Football after the game and he was waxing lyrical about the job Cattermole does for the team.

With his black boots on and his fighting style, he’s an old-school player. He scraps for every ball but his reputation precedes him. His disciplinary record is poor, but that comes from playing on the edge.

One thing is for certain: he’s not one for the purists.

We are not blessed with many top defensive midfielders in this country but Cattermole is more than holding his own against some of Europe’s best this season.

Our table below shows how defensively he is matching the likes of Sergio Busquets and Daniele de Rossi. I’m not saying he is at the same level as them, but he should not be dismissed out of hand.

Against Chelsea he showed he can perform against the very best. Some people will never be convinced, but if he can curb that aggression then maybe even bigger things lie ahead.

West Ham's Noble cause

Lee Cattermole is not the only Englishman who might feel overlooked by his country.

Mark Noble is West Ham’s Mr Consistent.

You would do well to find a player in the Premier League who gives more for his team than Noble, but he’s a quality player, too.

He’s another who does not jump out as an obvious talent but he does an excellent job in a team that is going places this season.

He will have seen Stewart Downing head off for England duty and Fabian Delph and Jack Colback have been called up recently. Noble might rightly be wondering when it will be his turn.

Frank gunning for Chelsea

Frank Lampard's move to Man City raised a few eyebrows, but it’s been a move that has benefited both parties.

Aside from his equaliser against his old club, the deal has not really hampered Chelsea and it has certainly helped City.

Who wouldn’t want the greatest goalscoring midfielder in Premier League history in their squad?

After scoring at Southampton he now has 174 PL goals — one behind Thierry Henry. That is an incredible record.

No doubt he’s looking forward to his American adventure but right now he will be focused on one thing: hunting down Chelsea.

He’ll say all the right things in public but make no mistake, Frank is a winner. He’d love nothing more than to help City beat Chelsea to the title.

Jurgen's starting to Klopp some flak

Arsenal fans unfurled a banner at West Brom saying Arsene Wenger’s time is up. They should be careful what they wish for.

People point to Jurgen Klopp as Wenger’s heir, but they need to be pointed towards the Bundesliga table.

Klopp’s Borussia Dortmund team lost again on Sunday and are bottom, 22 points behind leaders Bayern Munich.

Klopp says he wants to manage in England one day. At the minute he should just concentrate on keeping his job in Germany.

Santi starting to sharpen up

This season I have been a bit disappointed by Santi Cazorla, but

I’m a big fan of the little man.

He has not played too often in 2014-15 but whenever he has, he hasn’t taken his chances. He’s been shunted around and has had to play second fiddle to the sensational Alexis Sanchez.

At West Brom his pass for Danny Welbeck’s goal was sublime and it looked like he was getting back to his best.

Jedinak goes the extra Mile

51 - Tackles made by Mile Jedinak so far this season. Only Nathaniel Clyne (57) has made more

Mile Jedinak is Crystal Palace’s Roy of the Rovers. They have some good players but Jedinak is the driving force in that side. Last season he won 102 tackles — more than any other midfielder. Now he is adding goals to his repertoire.

Last week he scored a spectacular free-kick against Liverpool and all we spoke about was how badly Liverpool defended.

If that were Alexis Sanchez or Wayne Rooney we would be going crazy over that goal.

He is a real captain, always leading the way, and another fine example of an unsung midfield hero.

Spurred on

I’ve been critical of Tottenham in the past, but they were good against Everton. They have made some poor signings but Christian Eriksen is a shining light for them.

384 - Despite their undoubted individual brilliance, Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney have never quite clicked as a strike partnership. Van Persie teed up Rooney for Manchester United’s second against Hull but it was the first time the two had combined for a league goal in 384 days — the last one came against Arsenal in a 1-0 win on November 10, 2013.

504 - Esteban Cambiasso's goal against QPR ended Leicester’s 504-minute wait for a goal. Nigel Pearson’s side had not scored since a 2-2 draw against Burnley on October 4.

627 - Roberto Soldado finally ended his Premier League goal drought after 627 minutes. Soldado last scored in March against Cardiff.

700th - Saturday's 3-0 defeat at Old Trafford came in Steve Bruce’s 700th game as a manager. He has been in charge at Hull, Sunderland, Wigan, Birmingham, Crystal Palace, Huddersfield and Sheffield United.

54 mins - It took West Brom 54 minutes to have an attempt at goal against Arsenal, the longest wait for any team this season.

18 - Wilfried Bony is still the main man in 2014. After his goal against Crystal Palace, the Swansea striker has 18 Premier League goals this calendar year, more than any other player.

82 - They have not been quite as free-scoring as they were last season, but City are still a force to be reckoned with up front. Manuel Pellegrini’s side have had 82 shots on target this season, more than any other team.
