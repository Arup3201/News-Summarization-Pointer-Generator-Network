Jailed broadcaster Rolf Harris has been banned from painting behind bars because his oils pose a fire risk, it was claimed today.

The disgraced entertainer is said to be in much demand from fellow inmates to sketch them at HMP Bullingdon, where he is serving a five-year, nine-month sentence.

However, in place of his favourite oil paints, he has had to resort to pencils after prison bosses decided flammable oil paints were a risk to health and safety.

Harris, 84, revealed the restrictions in conversation with visitors. A friend who visited Harris at the jail in Bicester, said that despite his conviction he was 'in good spirits.' The source knew Harris from his adopted hometown of Bray, Berkshire, but preferred not to be named. 

Harris, who is planning an appeal against his conviction, was said to be regularly asked by fellow inmates queuing outside his cell to capture their likeness.

But without his oils, the best he can do for them is a quick pencil sketch.

It hasn't all been fun and games for the former family favourite. Earlier reports have claimed he has lost a stone because he doesn't like the prison food and had become a 'hate figure' because of his paedophile crimes.

The Australian entertainer was in June convicted of 12 indecent assaults on four girls as young as eight.

In July, reports claimed that Harris was spat at by an inmate during a prison church service, an incident which was said to have sparked a mass brawl.

More recently, he was accused by a fellow prisoner of 'jumping the queue' into a paid gardening job in the grounds of the Oxfordshire jail.

Harris' frail wife Alwen is understood to also regularly visit her husband in Bullingdon prison, arriving in a wheelchair.

She stood by Harris as he was unmasked as a paedophile who was fixated with underage girls during his trial at Southwark Crown Court.

He was jailed for his decades preying on victims including and abusing his daughter's friend for 16 years. He even attacked her as his daughter slept in the same room.

His fall from grace was underlined as he was stripped of a Bafta fellowship and accolades in his native Australia were removed, and he faces losing his prestigious CBE.

The performer's multi-million pound fortune is also at risk from potential compensation claims.

While refusing to discuss individual inmates such as Rolf Harris, a Prisons Department spokesman confirmed that inflammable substances like oil-based paints were not permitted in Britain's jails.
