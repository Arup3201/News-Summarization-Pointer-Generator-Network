Commuters on the line where a fare dodger went five years without buying a ticket have hailed the mystery man a hero.

A hedge fund manager is believed to have ducked the daily £24.50-each-way fare from his local station in Stonegate, East Sussex to London's Cannon Street by exploiting a loophole using his Oyster Card.

But while train operator Southeastern have slammed his behaviour and hit him with a £43,000 fine, fellow passengers at the rural station have expressed their respect for the fare-cheat.

The rural station of Stonegate, East Sussex was used by a hedge fund manager thought to be one the biggest fare dodgers in history

Local Dave Johnson, who also works in the City, said: 'I reckon he must have thought he was James Bond - hiding from the ticket inspectors in the loos and that.

'It would certainly make my morning more exciting. The fact he got away with it for so long makes you wonder whether you'd be able to get away with it yourself.

'I wouldn't give it a go though, I'd be too scared.'

Another commuter, who said he also worked for a hedge fund, said: 'Good on him. Trains are too expensive anyway, and the service is rubbish.

'I wish I had the guts to do what he did. What a hero.'

Another passenger on the line, who asked not to be named, added: 'I don't think there's anything wrong with it morally - the train companies hold commuters to ransom.

'The sky high fares just go up and up - the man's a bit of a modern-day Robin Hood.'

In the nearby village of Ticehurst, a waitress told The Independent that Southeastern trains should have been 'more on the ball'.

'It serves them right. How did he get away with it for five years? It puts the rail system to shame,' she said.

It emerged today that, despite his five-figure fine, the man have got off lightly, because rules state he should have paid double the full fare.

Other commuters were less sympathetic towards the man, who is believed to be one of the biggest fare dodgers in history.

Robert Jack, who also catches the train to Cannon Street every morning, said: 'I probably get my ticket checked once or twice a week.

The fare dodger got away with the scam for five years after 'tapping out' with his Oyster card when he got to London

'I don't know how this guy got away with it for so long, but it's disgraceful. It's people like him who raise the prices for everyone else.

'Also, he could obviously afford the ticket because he paid his fine immediately.

'He should have the book thrown at him and be banned from the trains - that'll teach him for being so dishonest.'

According to a report in the Sunday Times, the senior executive is believed to have travelled into London without buying any ticket and avoiding detection from 2008 until the end of last year.

He was able to get off his train at London Bridge and cross a platform to catch a service to Cannon Street without having to go through any barriers.

At Cannon Street, he used an Oyster card to exit the barriers, paying the then maximum £7.20 fare incurred when a passenger taps out without having tapped in.

Fellow commuters have said the train companies 'hold passengers to ransom' and should be more vigilant

But on November 25 last year a ticket inspector standing next to the barriers spotted he had paid £7.20 and not the £2.30 for a single ticket.

After being challenged, the passenger later admitted to dodging the correct fare on five journeys between London Bridge and Cannon Street.

Suspicious investigators for Southeastern then discovered that the man had for a number of years up until 2008 been purchasing an annual ticket from Stonegate.

And within five days of being caught out at Cannon Street, the executive renewed his season ticket, leading Southeastern to believe he had been dodging the fare for his commute for five years.

Rail Union TSSA have been left angry by the fact the man escaped prosecution by reaching an out-of-court settlement with the train company.

Union leader Manuel Cortes said: 'There seems to be one law for the rich and one law for the poor when it comes to criminal prosecution.

'This guy can buy silence, but that isn't offered to most people who are caught fare dodging.'

Southeastern said all passengers have the option to avoid prosecution and settle out of court.

The train company told the Sunday Times that the executive wanted to protect his identity because he was concerned about the impact it would have on his job.

A spokesperson added: 'All customers have the option to settle out of court and in this case he chose to pay the settlement fee that we put to him.

'The customer wanted to protect his identity and did not admit to evading fares for five years at any point during the process.'
