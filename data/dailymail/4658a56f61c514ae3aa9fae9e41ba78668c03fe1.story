Facing jail: Conman Christopher O'Neill, who set up the Forces for Good company, receiving an award in 2011

A conman who set up a project to help returning war heroes spent its funds on wining and dining a string of women.

Despite having previous convictions for dishonesty, Chris O'Neill, 51, had the ear of politicians as he campaigned to raise awareness of the plight of 'forgotten heroes'.

He was handed a £120,000 grant from the Welsh Assembly to refurbish a hotel and six cottages for servicemen to recover.

But instead O'Neill, of Colwyn Bay, north Wales,  transferred £74,800 in the bank account of his company Forces For Good Limited to a personal account for his own use.

He also withdrew £6,500 to pay costs incurred by him during stays in hotels and 
guesthouses and retained £7,000 cash takings from the Jenevoire Hotel at Llandudno and from another project for his own use.

O'Neill blew the cash on a lavish spending spree that included buying a speedboat, racking up gambling debts and trying to romance three women at the same time.

He also ripped off a dying woman by persuading her to invest £30,000 from a divorce settlement in the hotel and then continued to cash cheques from her account after she died.

O’Neill had faced a further charge of making off without paying a hotel bill of £808 in Chester last September.

Yesterday, he was warned at Caernarfon Crown Court in North Wales that he faced a prison term after he admitted two counts of fraud. He was remanded in custody for a pre-sentence report.

Defence counsel Jonathan Austin said there was a 'basis of plea' and O'Neill didn't accept he was dishonest from the outset.

Judge Niclas Parry warned O'Neill: 'This is an extremely serious matter involving a substantial fraud on the public purse.'

He said he faced a prison term when he returned to court on February 20. Among those to be taken in by the conman were Welsh Conservatives.

In 2011 they launched their Armed Forces Card to reward serving and former armed forces personnel with free local bus travel and other benefits.

They were 'delighted' to receive the backing of O'Neill at its launch. O'Neill has claimed to be a veteran of Northern Ireland.

He's given evidence to the Welsh Government about post-traumatic stress disorder treatment for veterans.

Last night one veteran said: 'He's done a great deal of harm.'

The Forces For Good website described it as a social enterprise company 
working from Llandudno, Anglesey and Wrexham helping ex-armed forces 
personnel and their families to services they require, and offering 
mentoring and support.

Its registered address was on Anglesey and it 
operated a hotel in Llandudno, a nine-house supported housing project on
Anglesey, plus a caravan site.

However, according to the Companies House website it has since been dissolved.
