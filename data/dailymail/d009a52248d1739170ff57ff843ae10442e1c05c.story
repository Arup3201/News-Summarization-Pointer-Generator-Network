A brave rape survivor took the podium at a Maryland state Senate meeting this week and told the frightening tale about being stalked by a man she never met. 

Jacqueline Kahn was speaking in support of a measure that would allow residents in Maryland to carry concealed weapons for self-defense. 

The state is currently one of just a handful in the nation that doesn't allow residents to carry firearms on the basis of protection alone.

Passionate: Rape-survivor Jacqueline Kahn spoke at a Maryland senate committee meeting last week in support of a measure that would allow residents to carry concealed handguns for self defense 

'I need you to know this is so incredibly difficult for me, but I feel like if I don't humanize this, if I don't make it clear how this legislation actually affects your daughters, your mothers, the women of this state, then it's all just a bunch of numbers,' Kahn told lawmakers.

In her presentation, Kahn told the Senators about how a man was once arrested in her back yard with duct tape and a knife. 

'I wish I could tell you that's the only time I've been stalked, or that's the only man who has stalked anyone in the state of Maryland. But there's a huge number of women, who like me have been raped, who like me have been sexually assaulted — and we want the right to be able to do what we would be allowed to do throughout the majority of the rest of the United States,' she said. Kahn didn't speak about the details of her rape.

Right to bear arms: The above states in green allow residents to carry concealed weapons for self defense. Maryland is considering joining these states 

Kahn says she enjoys spending her time in 'secluded places' like the beach or on mountain hikes, but that she doesn't feel safe going on these adventures alone, unarmed, in adherence to the current laws.

On one outing, Kahn says she was sleeping in a tent, when woke up to a man trying to enter.  

'When I'm in my house, I'm allowed to protect myself. But walking along the sidewalk, I'm not. So you make me into a criminal. You force me to decide, do I want to be judged by 12 or carried by six.'

Kahn also pulled out a map that shows that most states allow citizens to carry concealed weapons for self-defense purposes. 

The Maryland State Senate is currently deciding whether to add self-defense to concealed handgun permits.
