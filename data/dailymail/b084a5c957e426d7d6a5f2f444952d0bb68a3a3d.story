'Murdered': Thomas Lang, 91, died after his grandson Stephen grabbed him round the neck and stole his £300 pension money, a court heard

A teenager murdered his frail grandfather during a botched robbery for his £300 pension money, a court heard today.

Stephen Lang grabbed 91-year-old Thomas Lang, 'broke his neck' and pushed him to the floor during the attack in the early hours of April 17 last year.

Lang, now 20, went to his bedroom and stole £300 from a wallet that was hidden under a pillow.

He then fled, leaving his grandfather seriously hurt on the floor of his home in Launceston, Cornwall.

Despite his injuries, Mr Lang was able to summon help at 1.44am on a lifeline alarm that he wore around his neck, Truro Crown Court heard.

Simon Laws QC, prosecuting, told jurors: 'In the early hours of April 17 last year Stephen Lang paid a visit to his grandfather.

'He attacked him and he inflicted very serious injuries upon him.

'He broke his neck and he caused injuries to the structures of the throat. Mr Lang died from his injuries a few days later in hospital.

'The motive had been robbery. The defendant stole a few hundred pounds while his grandfather was lying on the floor unable to move.'

Carers alerted the pensioner’s son, Keith - who is Stephen Lang's uncle - and he rushed to his father’s sheltered housing flat in Trecarn Close.

Mr Lang discovered the flat door slightly ajar, signs of a disturbance with the coffee table knocked over and his elderly father on the floor of the lounge.

The pensioner asked his son to call the police and then told him what had happened.

'He said Stephen Lang had come to the flat saying that he had just finished work,' Mr Laws said.

'He had then attacked his grandfather, grabbing him around the neck. Thomas Lang thought the defendant had been trying to break his neck.

'He had one arm around the front of his neck and one arm around the back. He was terrified to move because his neck was painful.'

Mr Laws said that Keith Lang dialled 999 and asked for the police and an ambulance.

The operator spoke to his father, who told them: 'My grandson came in, I don’t know for what reason. He came in and attacked me.

'He was twisting my neck and that. I am lying on the ground now and I just can’t move.'

The pensioner told the operator that there was £300 of his pension money missing from his wallet and added: 'I would have given him some if he’d asked.'

The court heard that there was also between £8,000 and £10,000 locked in a safe in his wardrobe of the ground-floor flat.

Mr Lang was taken to Derriford Hospital in Plymouth for treatment and told medical staff: 'I can’t believe this has happened.'

The pensioner later told police that his grandson had 'lost everything - his temper, his sense'.

Mr Lang deteriorated and sadly succumbed to his injuries three days later in hospital.

A post-mortem examination found he had died from pneumonia caused by the injuries he suffered.

'The injuries were of a kind seen in those who died as a result of neck compression,' Mr Laws said.

'To cause those injuries took force - force that was quite deliberately applied. No-one could apply force of that severity to a man of any age without intending to cause really serious harm.

'To use force of that kind against a man of Mr Lang’s age - in his physical condition - invites one conclusion only, the prosecution say, that the defendant intended to cause really serious harm.

'What else could he have intended? Remember what Mr Lang had said: that he thought the defendant had been trying to break his neck.'

The court heard that Mr Lang was at the head of a large family - many of whom lived in the local area - including the defendant.

The pensioner, who walked with the aid of a trolley, received four visits a day from carers who helped him with washing, dressing and eating.

His GP said he was 'frail but relatively independent' and in 'good health'.

Mr Laws said Mr Lang 'spoke warmly' to others about his grandson.

'There does not appear to have been any trouble between the two of them until April 17 when the defendant decided to attack and rob him,' he said.

The jury heard he had an ‘expensive drug habit’ two years before which cost him £140 a day to satisfy, said Mr Laws.

He added that Lang had said that he had been drinking 
all night and had been to three local pubs but CCTV showed him walking 
competently and using a mobile phone to call a taxi.

Trial: Stephen Lang, 20, pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of his grandfather but denies murder

He lied to police before admitting he had argued with his grandfather after the old man had called him ‘a waste of space’.

But he said he pulled his walking trolley away from him causing him to he fell to the floor and he panicked and took the cash and left.

Mr Laws said: 'He was adamant he had not touched his grandfather’s neck. He did not know why he had not dialled 999.'

Lang, of Launceston, Cornwall denies murder.

However, before the trial was due to start today he accepted he had killed his grandfather by pleading guilty to manslaughter - a plea not accepted by the Crown.

Mr Laws told the jury of five men and seven women: 'We say it is a case of murder.

'The question in the case really is this. At the time he attacked Thomas Lang did the defendant intend to cause really serious harm to him?

'If he did, he is guilty of murder. If he did not, he is not guilty of murder but guilty only of manslaughter - the offence to which he has already pleaded guilty.'

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
