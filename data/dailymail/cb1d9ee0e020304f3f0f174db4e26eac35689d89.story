A mother who was seriously injured when a flight information board fell on top of her and three of her sons at an Alabama airport on Friday still doesn't know that one of the boys was killed in the horrific incident.

Heather Bresette suffered broken ankles and a crushed pelvis when the billboard, weighing at least 300 pounds, dropped from the wall as her family were standing beneath it at Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport. She and two of her sons, who were also injured, were improving at hospitals on Sunday.

But the woman's 10-year-old son Luke was killed by the electronic board.

Ms Bresette had had surgeries over the weekend and was getting better, University Hospital spokeswoman Nicole Wyatt said. However, she was still in intensive care and unconscious.

'She does not know that her baby is dead,' said the family's priest, the Rev. Don Farnan.

The Bresettes, a family of seven, took a
weeklong vacation in Destin, Fla., and were about to fly home to 
Overland Park, Kan., when the sign fell.

Luke Bresette, 10, was killed. His 
brother, 5-year-old Tyler, suffered a concussion but was expected to be 
released from a children's hospital. His 8-year-old brother, Sam, had a 
broken leg and nose.

Luke was the middle child of the 
five. The father, Ryan Bresette, and another son and daughter, were at 
the airport but not injured.

During their vacation, the family swam in the Gulf of Mexico and Luke went parasailing for the first time.

'His dad said he was thrilled. He was
an adventurous kid. He loved sports,' said Farnan, a priest at St. 
Thomas More in Kansas City, Mo.

After the sign fell, it took six 
people to lift the large board and a dozen people to hold it up while 
first responders administered aid. Officials were investigating how the 
sign fell at the newly renovated airport and took down an identical 
billboard on Saturday.

The renovated concourse opened March 
13. It was part of an ongoing $200 million upgrade of Birmingham's 
airport. The construction began in June 2011 and is being overseen by 
Brasfield & Gorrie Global Services Group.

The Birmingham-based company said in a statement it was working with airport authorities to determine why the sign fell.

'This is a terrible tragedy that none
of us fully understand, and we hope that the family who lost their 
loved one will find strength through prayer and the support of all of 
us,' the statement said.

At St. Thomas More, hundreds of 
worshippers showed up for a Saturday morning Mass that usually has about
75 people. Luke's uncle Alex Bresette placed a Rockhurst High School 
jersey on the altar.

'He would have been in the Class of 2020,' he told the Kansas City Star.

Ryan Bresette said in a message on Facebook that words cannot describe the pain the family feels.

In a note to his son, he wrote, 'I miss and love Luke so very much. I love you Luke!'

'Ryan is especially grateful for the 
amazing support of the people in Birmingham. They even started a fund 
for the family at a bank there,' Farnan said. 'There are long, loving 
arms that stretch between Birmingham and Kansas City.'

Heather Bresette 
and her three sons were standing beneath a 
flight information sign at the Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International 
Airport when it fell without warning.

Scene: Witnesses reported a loud crash with people screaming in the area before eight to 10 people hurried to lift the massive board off of the family

Luke was pronounced dead at Children's of Alabama, said Deputy Coroner Derrick Perryma. Heather
Bresette, who remained conscious throughout the terrible ordeal, was 
taken to UAB Hospital with two broken ankles and a fractured pelvis.

The airport completed the first phase
of a more than $201 million modernization effort and opened newly 
renovated concourses about a week ago.

Mayor William Bell said he talked 
with the boy's father - who was not injured - and is pressing officials 
to explain how the sign toppled over.

'I
cannot come close to understanding his heartache. But I will get 
answers. I'm calling on the airport authority to thoroughly investigate 
this horrible incident. I want a full report on my desk as quickly as 
possible,' he told AL.com.

Airport officials met Saturday, but would not elaborate on other safety measures being taken.

'President
and CEO Al Denson and the staff are continuing to work with officials 
to investigate. This includes discussions with contractors and 
subcontractors responsible for the modernization,' Chairwoman of the 
Airport Authority Board of Directors Gaynell Hendricks said in a 
statement.

The contractors and subcontractors were not identified.

Airport
spokeswoman Toni Herrera-Bast said officials aren't sure how the sign 
fell. The airport continued operating while rescue workers tended to the
family.

Heather underwent surgery on Saturday night, but
surgeons decided her body wasn't strong enough for all the work they 
needed to be done and so she was due to have additional surgery on 
Sunday. 

The two younger boys Sam, 8, and Tyler, 5, are being treated at Children's of Alabama where their condition is described as 'fair'. Sam has a broken leg 
and nose, while Tyler has a concussion.

The terrible incident occurred at 
about 1:30 p.m. on Friday as the family were returning to Overland Park,
Kansas after spending a week in Destin for Spring Break.

Husband and 
father Ryan Bresette wasn't injured, nor was older sister Anna and 
another brother, Joe.

Luke was the third of the five children and was in
the fifth grade at St. Thomas More School, Kansas City.

His uncle Alex Bresette has described his nephew as someone who was full of love and life.

‘He was a beautiful boy,' he told AL.com. ‘He was great in school. He was bright and inquisitive.’

Luke enjoyed playing 
baseball, football, basketball and sang in the choir. He was also an 
avid fan of Notre Dame football and the Kansas Jayhawks.

'You know how some kids get too old to hug you anymore?' Alex Bresette said. 'Not Luke, he always hugged.'

Closed off: Two workers are seen cleaning in a closed off section of the terminal where the large sign, said to be between 300-400 pounds, fell off the wall

Safety measures: As a precautionary measure barricades have been placed around the airport's other flight status boards, the fallen one is seen here

Witnesses
said the family was walking by the giant sign when it came crashing 
down on top of them. It took six men to lift it off the family and later
about a dozen men held it up while rescue workers worked on the family.

The sign weighing between 300 and 400
pounds took eight to 10 bystanders to lift it off the family said 
Birmingham Fire and Rescue Battalion Chief Donald Jones.

The children's father is said to have
been checking them in at the nearby Southwest desk, according to a 
witness, when the horrific incident occurred.

'The 300-plus pound sign toppled and hit the family without warning,' witness to the scene Albert Osorio told AL.com.

'The whole thing flipped down on those kids. It took all of us here to stand it back up. Everybody started screaming.'

Mr
Osorio said that from what he saw, the sign appeared to have been 
attached to the wall 'only with liquid nails,' a type of caulking 
adhesive, he told the website.

Airport spokesperson Toni Herrera-Bast told WBRC an investigation is underway into why the board fell with the cause not immediately known.

Crews: Emergency crews rushed to the scene just after 1.30pm on Friday

Herrera-Bast said she wasn't sure how the board was attached to the wall.

A witness Tweeting a photo near the scene described it as 'blood everywhere and a mom screaming.'

The terminal was closed for a period after the tragic accident.

Barricades were positioned around the airport's other flight status boards as a precautionary measure.

Birmingham's
mayor William Bell released a statement immediately after the incident 
promising his full support in the investigation.

'I have offered our full support to the Airport Authority as they 
investigate what has occurred this afternoon. I have asked our public 
safety staff to assist this family in their time of need in any way 
possible as they grapple with what has happened,' the statement read.

The board was in a new terminal of the airport which opened last week following a $201 million modernization effort.

Flights were said to have not been disrupted going into or out of the airport due to the incident on Friday.
