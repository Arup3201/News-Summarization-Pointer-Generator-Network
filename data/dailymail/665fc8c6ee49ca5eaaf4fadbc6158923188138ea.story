The husband of an Arizona town's former mayor, himself a popular high school teacher, was mauled to death Saturday by the family dog.

Thomas Vick, 64, husband of ex-Bullhead City mayor Diane Vick, died in a hospital from wounds suffered after being attacked by the family's boxer. Ms Vick, 65, was injured in the attack.

The couple was trying to break up a fight between the boxer and another dog when the pets instead attacked them, according to the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

The boxer and a cocker spaniel were fighting Saturday night when the Vicks tried to intervene. The cocker spaniel licked its wounds and sulked away, the boxer did not.

Both were flown to a hospital in Las Vegas, about 90 miles to the north.

Mr Vick, a high-profile teacher at Mojave High School, died Sunday morning, according to AZCentral.

His wife 'was pretty beat up,' Bullhead City Mayor Jack Hakim told the site, but should recover. The mayor called the attack 'devastating.'

'We've had dog bites before but never something like this,' he continued. 'She was former mayor and he was a prominent high school teacher at Mohave High School... We're just grateful that at least one of them was able to survive.'

Comments on a Facebook memorial page set up in Mr Vick's honor spoke to his popularity.

'My thoughts and prayers goes out to the Vick Family. Mr.Vick was a good man and one of the best teachers I had at Mohave. you will be truly Missed,' one former student wrote.

'Mr. Vick didn't care who you were, he just cared. The world truly lost an amazing guy, may he rest in peace,' wrote another.

Many students said he was more than a teacher, several even considered him a friend.

The dogs have been taken to animal control.
