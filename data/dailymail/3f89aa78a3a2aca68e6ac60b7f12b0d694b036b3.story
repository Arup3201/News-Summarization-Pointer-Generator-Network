'We are looking forward to an exhilarating and intense week of competition here in New York,' said Tournament Chairman John Nimick. 

'There is no venue better suited than the spectacular Grand Central Terminal to showcase that competition.'

Egyptian Mens World No.1 Mohamed Elshorbagy and Malaysia's Nicol David, the defending Women's champion who has been world #1 for eight consecutive years, lead the draw. 

The Tournament of Champions has been a staple on the Professional Squash Association (PSA) circuit since 1993 and is regularly watched by more than 200,000 spectators during its week-long occupancy of Grand Central's stunning Vanderbilt Hall.   

However, this year the court, sponsored by tech firm NetSuite,  has received a hi-tech overhaul.

It now includes two 55' LED video monitors in the front wall and a 10' LED strip behind the tin.

The front wall monitors display revolving branding to cameras and the audience, and replays and Video Review to the players.

The LED tin displays moving images, daily match and lifestyle information and the event's corporate ID and details.

Now branded the NetSuite Challenge Court, the new portable all-glass court built by McWIL Squash will be used for the next five years at top level events including the NetSuite Open, the J.P. Morgan Tournament of Champions in New York’s Grand Central Terminal, Showdown in Boston and the KPMG Grand Slam Cup in Frankfurt.

'Thanks to JP Morgan and their commitment to make the Tournament of Champions a worldwide leader in squash, we are thrilled to make this added commitment to the women's division for 2015 and to plan for prize money parity and draw size equality in 2016 and beyond,' said Nimick
