Three Indian police officers have been suspended after a horrifying video was posted on Facebook which appears to show them violently beating a man with sticks and stealing money from his wallet.

In the clip, which was filmed near Red Fort in Delhi and posted by the Aam Aadmi political party, the man can be seen pleading with officers and wincing in pain as they pin him against a fence and thrash him with canes.

At one point the man appears to collapse in agony before an officer forces him back to his feet so the beating can continue.

Brutal: The man can be seen pleading with officers and wincing in pain as they pin him against a fence and thrash him with canes. At one point the man appears to collapse in agony

The full video, which was taken on a mobile phone on January 12, is around 20 minutes long. The majority of the video appears to show the man being beaten and robbed

With the man standing in tears, one of the officers appears to reach into his pocket and take money from his wallet, which he then throws over a fence out of the victim’s reach.

Another officer then repeatedly slaps the man in the face.

Party Facebook page, is around 20 minutes long.

Since being posted last week by local man Kapil Kumar, the video has had over 10,000 views on YouTube, many of which came indirectly through Aam Aadmi's social media platforms

Speaking to the Times of India, Aam Aadmi Party’s Delhi secretary Dilip Pandey said: ‘We have no personal agenda in this. This is just another incident of police brutality and AAP is simply saying that there is something seriously wrong with our policing system.’

The local police force reportedly attempted to justify the beating, saying the man was a pickpocket who had been caught ‘red handed’.  That account was later called into question, however, when the police argued that the man had been ‘let off’ with the crime.

Delhi police said they had identified and suspended the three police officers that appeared in the video and urged the victim to come forward to provide a statement.

An unidentified senior officer told the Times of India: ‘More stern action will be taken against the rogue policemen if required. No unruly behaviour will be tolerated.’

He added that a special team would investigate the incident at the earliest opportunity, with the officers’ statements due taken on Monday.

There have been several serious incidents of alleged police brutality in India in recent years, the most recent a violent clash between officers and villagers near Forbesganj in 2011.

During a protest over the building of a road, police shot and killed two villagers. Another two people died in the resulting violence, which also left 27 police officers and four villagers with serious injuries.

In 2003 police fired on tribal clans in the village of Muthanga in Kerala. The clans had gathered to protest a delay in allotting them land, which had been contracted in October 2001.

During the protest, Kerala Police fired 18 rounds resulting in two immediate fatalities - one of which was a police officer.

In a statement Kerala officials later placed the official death toll at five.
