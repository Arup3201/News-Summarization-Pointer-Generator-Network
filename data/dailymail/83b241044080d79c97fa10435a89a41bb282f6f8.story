A restaurant in the Philippines promises diners a refreshing meal - when they're soaked from head-to-toe between courses.

The Waterfalls Restaurant in the Villa Escudero resort gives guests a watery thrill, as its bamboo tables are right next to the Labasin Falls, a man-made cascade.

Extra sauce: Customers enjoying some extra refreshment with their meal at the Waterfalls restaurant

Located on a
 former coconut plantation in San Pablo City, the falls are run-off from
 a nearby dam - and those wanting some extra refreshment can hop into 
the water once they've finished their meal.

The
 jungle-sideÂ  restaurant serves up a buffet of meats and curries on 
bamboo leaves - with plenty of water to wash it down with.
