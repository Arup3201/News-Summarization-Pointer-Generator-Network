England have touched down in sunny Brazil ahead of the World Cup finals after an eight-and-a-half hour flight.

Roy Hodgson's men landed at around 8.30am Rio de Janeiro time after flying from Florida on Saturday night ready for this summer's tournament.

The team then made the hour-long journey to their hotel situated near Ipanema beach.

Hodgson took time out to speak to journalists after landing while the team coach was ready to take the players onto the team's World Cup base.

Members of the Brazilian military were pictured on Sunday afternoon lined up outside the Royal Tulip hotel where the England team will stay, hopefully, for the next month.

Everton defender Phil Jagielka posted a picture of the view from his room on Twitter and said: 'Just arrived in the hotel. Not a bad view to wake up to!'

Preparations will begin in earnest on Monday, when England will hold a fully-open session at their training centre at the Urca military base in the shadow of Rio landmark Sugar Loaf mountain.

The squad will then go through a closed work-out on Tuesday morning before training again on Wednesday.

Going through one last training session on Friday, England kick off their World Cup campaign against Group D opponents Italy on Saturday evening.

The Three Lions drew 0-0 with Honduras in their final warm-up match as an electrical storm delayed the match by over 40 minutes.
