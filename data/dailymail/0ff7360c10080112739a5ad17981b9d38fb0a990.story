London has been revealed as the most expensive destination in the world for a city break, closely followed by Paris and New York, according to a survey.

Tourists fork out on average £312 for a one-night stay in the UK's capital, more than three times the price of a break in best-value destination, Hanoi, Vietnam - which comes in at an average of £92.

London topped the annual TripAdvisor TripIndex Cities list of 48 major cities - rising six places to knock Oslo, Norway, off the top spot, with Paris crowned the next most expensive for visitors.

Oslo, Zurich, Copenhagen, Helsinki, Toronto and Sydney - at £225 for a one-night stay - made up the top 10 most expensive cities for Brits to visit for an overnight stay.

Hanoi was named the cheapest city to visit, with total costs at £92, with a meal for two plus wine costing only just over £20.

The next least-expensive destination was Jakarta in Indonesia (£95), followed by Sharm el Sheikh in Egypt (£96), Bangkok in Thailand (£97) and Sofia in Bulgaria (£112).

TripAdvisor spokesman James Kay said: 'This year's results show that Asian destinations are still the most affordable, while European destinations continue to top the most expensive list.

Value for money: The cost of dinner for two in Stockholm will go much further in Hanoi

'However, Eastern European countries such as Bulgaria and Czech Republic seem to be bucking this trend so may serve as the best places for UK travellers looking for a city break that's closer to home.'

The survey results also revealed Cancun offers the cheapest cocktails, at £2 for two; Stockholm offered the best-value dinners at £108 for two with wine; and taxi journeys were the most affordable in Jakarta - with a two-mile trip setting visitors back just £1.74.

Expensive ride: Cab journeys cost 20 times as much in Oslo as they do in Jakarta

Cocktails for two: Couples should allocate 15 times as much money for cocktails in Paris than in Cancun
