Kahlid Sheik Mohammed didn't crack after CIA interrogators pushed him around, slapped him, physically intimidated him or waterboarded him 183 times.

The mastermind of the September 11 terrorist attacks was finally spilled his information about upcoming al-Qaeda plots after he was kept awake for 180 hours -- seven and a half days -- straight.

A new book released by the CIA's former National Clandestine Service director, who oversaw the interrogation of Mohammed and other captured terrorists, revealed that the CIA used tough techniques, torture by some definitions, to extract information that helped thwart future attacks on the United States.

Defiant: Khalid Sheik Mohammed, the mastermind of the September 11 attacks, was defiant in his court appearance Saturday

José Rodriguez Jr, revealed in 'Hard Measures' that US officials were only able to extract the information from Mohammed because they subjected him to such harsh interrogation.

'Even with waterboarding, he was counting on his fingers, because he knew we would stop at 10, so he wasn’t terribly intimidated by that,' Mr Rodriguez told the New York Post.

'It was the sleep deprivation that finally got him.'

US authorities captured Mohammed in 2003 in Rawalpindi, Pakistan, and hid him at a CIA 'black site' for his interrogation.

When they asked him about future terrorist plots, he said only, 'soon you will know.'

Mohammed and five other men accused in the 2001 attacks on New York and Washington DC appeared at a military tribunal Saturday. Families of victims of the terror plot watched the proceedings in Guantanamo Bay via video link.

Mohammed was defiant and refused to answer the judge's questions. 

He wasn't so tight-lipped after CIA interrogators kept him awake for more than a week.

Rodriguez has admitted to destroying 92 tapes of the interrogations, saying he was protecting his agents and the reputation of the United States.

Interrogators tried several unsuccessful techniques to get Mohammed, 48, to spill his knowledge, the Rodriquez writes.

Captured: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was subjected to waterboarding 183 times, but never divulged information as a result of the procedure

He was stripped naked and forced to stand in his cell. Then he was given only Ensure protein shakes for nutrition and made to wear a diaper.

When humiliation didn't work, Mohammed's captors got physical with other 'corrective techniques.'

He was 'walled' -- pushed around in a small room so that his shoulder blades hit the plywood walls with a 'boom.'

Interrogators grabbed him by the collar and yanked him -- the 'attention grab.' They squeezed his face been their hands and held it still -- the 'facial hold.' And they slapped him in the face, specifically between the chin and the bottom of the earlobe -- the 'insult slap.'

Finally he was waterboarded -- water was poured on his face while he was tied down, simulating drowning. Operatives did this 183 times.

The 30 other CIA detainees broke down much more easily, usually the first time an interrogator slapped them. Al-Qaeda operatives were trained that their American captures would never touch them, the Post reported.

But none of those techniques ever broke Mohammed, a Kuwaiti who studied  in Greensboro, North Carolina. He still claimed he didn't speak any English and knew only Urdu, the language of Muslim Indians and Pakistanis.

Finally, the CIA resolved to keep Mohammed awake. He was restrained in stress positions, being forced to stand or squat in an uncomfortable and tiring pose.

Interrogators told him he would be allowed to sleep as soon as he politely asked them if he could lay down.

It took 180 hours, Rodriquez said, but Mohammed finally broke and began spilling information in torrents.

Still, Rodriquez says Mohammed was treated better than an American could have expected in the hands of al-Qaeda.

'It was much kinder than anything he would have done to an American captive, like Danny Pearl,' he told the Post.

Pearl, a Wall Street Journal reporter, was kidnapped in Pakistan by 2002. He was beheaded on video by Mohammed. 

The intelligence collected from Mohammad because of the interrogation techniques led to several terrorist plots because uncovered, including a 2003 plan to replicate the September 11 attacks on the West Coast -- this time with southeast Asian shoe-bombers aboard planes.
