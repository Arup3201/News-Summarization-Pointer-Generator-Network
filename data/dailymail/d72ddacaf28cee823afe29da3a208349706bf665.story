If you were stuck in a rut in the bedroom who would you turn to for advice? A best friend? A therapist? Homer Simpson?

One cheeky cartoonist has decided Springfield's slobbiest resident is in fact the love machine that the rest of us need to be taking sexytime advice from. And sorry Marge, but you have been replaced in his affections with a cartoon version of ice queen Anna Wintour.

The fearsome Vogue editor (complete with signature bob and black sunglasses) and a Y-front wearing Homer appear in a series of risque drawings by Italian cartoonist aleXsandro Palombo in his latest satirical blog entry.

Italian illustrator aleXsandro Palombo has created a series of sketches offering erotic advice featuring Anna Wintour and Homer Simpson

Titled 'Illustrated Erotic Advice with Homer Simpson and Vogue Editrix Anna Wintour' the work features pictures of the semi-clad cartoon characters showcasing various forms of sexual kinks including role play, submission and even foot fetishism.

Artist aleXsandro was previously a knitwear designer, showing his collections
 at Milan Fashion Week, but the illustrator is now better known as a subversive force 
via his blog Humor Chic.

He describes the blog as a daily society portrait: 'The best illustrated fashion chronicle, a point of view about costume, politics, culture, society and celebrity,' and describes himself as 'the father of Fashion Satire, visionary artist, author and critic.'

Talking about his latest work he 
said: 'Homer Simpson is the perfect embodiment of the average man today 
with all his frustrations, desires and weaknesses. He is also The Male 
Chauvinist. Similarly, Anna Wintour is the embodiment of the liberated 
women, a woman of power. She represents the ideal feminist.

'They are the two opposites of the 
same coin and represent a good part of the society in which we live. 
That's why I thought they were two figures of interest to interpret this
 role playing game. Both are definitely having fun.'

The risque images feature the fearsome fashion editor and the slobby Simpsons character in a variety of poses aimed at helping couples stuck in a rut

On the blog aleXsandro says: 'When I put pencil to paper, I know where I'll start but I don't know where I'll finish.

'My
 panels are like a performance and not a copy of real life. Every 
character wears a creation of mine, my personal vision of style.'

It will be interesting to know what fashion queen Anna makes of his 'personal vision of style' as she is depicted in various rather lewd positions wearing little more than thigh-high boots and bunny ears.

And this isn't the first time that the illustrator has used Anna as a reference in his work, previously he has imagined her and several of her high-flying designer friends in the style of 
Matt Groening's favourite family from Springfield.

AleXsandro also transformed the fashion pack, including Karl Lagerfeld, Alber Elbaz, Marc Jacobs and curator Diane 
Pernet, in to bright blue smurfs in celebration of the Belgian comic and 
television sensation of 1958.
