As his former team-mates prepared for the first day of the football season, Adam Gemili put them in the shade by winning 200m gold at the European Championships and is confident of another title in the 4x100m relay.

Gemili spent time on Chelsea’s books as a schoolboy and was on the verge of signing a professional contract for Dagenham and Redbridge.

He said: ‘When I was younger and playing sport I always dreamed of hearing the national anthem because I’d won.

But I thought I’d be singing it because I was playing football for England. Athletics wasn’t even on my radar then. It’s mental how things can change in such a short space of time.’

Gemili ran 19.98sec for the second time in his life to blitz the 200m field in cold, rainy conditions on Friday evening.

‘I’ve received so many messages from former team-mates saying “well done”,’ he said, ‘It’s really nice of them and it’s nice to be in contact and to see them all doing so well in football.’

Gemili will rejoin the 4x100m relay team for today’s final and said: ‘It’s going to be interesting but I believe we have the speed and ability to take this title.’

Podium: After his gold medal in the 200m, Gemili believes he can get a gold in the 4x100m relay

Talented: Gemili also spent time on the books for football club Dagenham and Redbridge when he was younger
