A former model who waged a stalking 
campaign against Rio Ferdinand was branded a danger to the footballer 
and his family today as she was jailed for 18 weeks.

Susanne Ibru, 39, described as 'a predatory and manipulative fantasist,' was arrested last month after being caught loitering outside the Manchester United defender’s £5m mansion.

The crazed fan had earlier been banned from going near 33-year old Ferdinand, his wife Rebecca, 31, and their three small children after she repeatedly made a 400-mile round trip from London to Cheshire just to call at their family home.

Gesture: The order had banned Ibru from trying 
to contact Mr Ferdinand and his family. She has previous convictions 
including for  wounding, criminal damage and assault

But last month the footballer’s 
security staff were forced to call in police again when she ignored the 
restraining order by turning up late at night by taxi and began pressing
the intercom buzzer.

When police arrived Ibru told them, 'My name is Susanne Ibru, and this is my house. My belongings are in 
there.'

It was not known whether Ferdinand and his family were at home 
at the time.

Ibru, from Peckham, South London, 
today gave a one fingered salute and yelled abuse as she was led away 
from Macclesfield magistrates court in handcuffs.

She also vowed to appeal against her jail term after she pleaded guilty to breaching a restraining order.

JP Denise Rankin told her: 'Your antecedent history makes this offence more serious.

'You have brought psychological harm 
to the victims living at the property and you have a history of 
breaching court orders and a pattern of violent offending.

'You are a high risk and there is a 
possibility of serious harm to the victim and also to his family and 
staff living at the property.'

Ibru, who has previous convictions for
wounding, criminal damage, assault, public order offences and 
possessing an offensive weapon, had claimed she was an accomplished 
athlete with ambitions of becoming a sports agent.

But she was also said in expert reports to be 'living in a fantasy world, unable to interpret social situations and boundaries.'

The
stalking campaign arose out of claims by Ibru that she had met the 
soccer star at the home of his stepfather’s mother in Peckham in 1998.

Over a four-month period in 2010
she repeatedly turned up at the Ferdinands’ home in the middle of the 
night claiming she needed to speak to the footballer to 'resolve some 
issues.'

Victims: Ibru has appeared at the Ferdinand's family home uninvited on several occasions demanding to see the Manchester United star (Mr Ferdinand is seen here with his wife Rebecca)

She was warned by police about her conduct but she claimed she was 'more than' just a football fan and added: 'He needs to ask his mum why I’m turning up at his house.'

Ibru even told one officer she would be 'packing up and moving in with Rio this week or next week.'

But the former England captain told the court he had no idea what Ibru wanted to speak to him about and her actions had left him so alarmed he had thought about installing CCTV and additional security at his home.

He said in a previous court hearing how he had felt 'angry and upset' about Ibru's behaviour and was 'worried' for the safety of his family.

He said he first met her through a liaison officer at Old Trafford in 2006. The footballer’s wife Rebecca said she believed Ibru was 'obsessed' with her husband and insisted talk of the stalker having had a relationship with him was 'all lies.'

In May last year Ibru was jailed for ten weeks after admitting harassment and was banned from contacting Ferdinand and his family for ten years.

Campaign: Ibru, a former model, has been described as a 'fantasist' following her stalking campaign against Mr Ferdinand

The order also forbids her from attending any match or public events where he would be present.

Yet on September 21 this year, at 11pm, police were called to the address in Alderley Edge as she tried once again to make a late night visit.

In court today Ibru - of no fixed address, appeared handcuffed in the dock with her hair scraped into a bun, wearing a cream suit jacket and clutching at scraps of paper.

The court was told she had sacked her solicitor and would be representing herself.

Prosecutor Kate Marchuk said: 'She was made the subject of a restraining order on May 9th last year.

'That order would bar her from attending or entering Alderley Edge in Cheshire or communicating with Mr and Mrs Ferdinand and not to go to any venue where he would be in person.

'This was breached when on September 21st, security officers contacted the police saying that an unknown female was pressing the intercom buzzer.

'She had got out of a taxi at around 11pm and tried to gain entry, but she was challenged by one of the security officers as she pressed the intercom buzzer.

'On the police’s arrival - and knowing of her history and [the] restraining order - they promptly arrested her.

'But she became abusive to the police and was taken to the station and interviewed.'

She said she had lived there for 15 years and that she did not care about the restraining order.

'I’m going straight back there as soon as I get out,' she said.

In her defence, Ibru told magistrates: 'I have nothing to say apart from my belongings are at my home.

'That is my home and I did not say to police officers that I had lived there for 15 years - that house had not been bought then, it was purchased in 2002. My belongings are there.'
