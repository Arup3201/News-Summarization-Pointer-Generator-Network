Norwegian prodigy Martin Odegaard admits Liverpool are his dream club but that will not influence any decision on his future.

The teenager was known to be one of the brightest properties in Europe even before he made his debut for the national senior side last month aged just 15, becoming the youngest player to feature in a European Championship qualifier.

He has already trained with the youth teams of Bundesliga sides Bayern Munich and Stuttgart - and also met Borussia Dortmund manager Jurgen Klopp - has visited Real Madrid and is set to see Liverpool's facilities for himself next month.

And while the Stromsgodset midfielder has followed his father in becoming a Reds fan, he is confident that will not affect his thinking when he makes his next career choice, most likely in the summer.

'Liverpool have always been my dream club,' Odegaard told German newspaper Sport Bild.

'But I will not let this affect my decision when I choose a new club.

'It's all about finding the team that is best for me and for my development. That is not necessarily Liverpool.

The 15-year-old wonderkid is a life-long fan of Liverpool but says that won't influence any decision he makes

'I haven't really thought about my future yet. I will end the season here and then visit a number of clubs. I have not made a final decision yet, though.

'Of course, it's flattering when you hear that big clubs are after you, but I don't think about it too often.'

Last week Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, speaking after their 1-0 defeat to Real Madrid in the Champions League, was reluctant to talk about Odegaard but did praise his qualities.

'I know he's a big talent, at that age to be playing senior football at 15 and in a competitive league,' said the Northern Irishman.

'He's got wonderful ability and wonderful talent, but there's nothing much more to say on him.'
