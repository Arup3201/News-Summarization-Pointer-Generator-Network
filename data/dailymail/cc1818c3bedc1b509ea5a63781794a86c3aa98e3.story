Bradford City's FA Cup third round replay against Millwall descended into chaos at Valley Parade in the first-half as their players and staff became embroiled in a mass brawl on the touchline.

Millwall's Alan Dunne pushed Bradford's James Hanson, forcing the striker into the advertising hoardings. That sparked a touchline bust-up with almost the entire playing and coaching staff involved.

Referee James Adcock  seemingly missed at least two punches from Millwall keeper David Forde who had sprinted 30 yards to get involved.

Adcock eventually restored order and booked Forde, Dunne and Bradford's Billy Knott but also sent Bradford manager Phil Parkinson and his assistant Steve Parkin to the stands for their part in the trouble.

After the match Parkinson said: 'The lad Dunne has pushed Hanson into the advertising boards and I thought it was a dangerous challenge because there’s a wall just behind there.

'Me and Steve have reacted and run down, as well as some of their coaching staff but the ref has decided to send me and Steve to the stands.

‘The ref said it was for leaving the technical area. I was trying to make sure there was no brawl but it certainly wasn’t to instigate anything. I know that you can’t leave the technical area but I thought being sent to the stands was a little bit harsh.

‘You can get a yellow card for trying to injure an opposing player but me and Steve got sent to the stands. We’ll have to take that on the chin and I’m glad it hasn’t ruined a great night.

‘I said to the lads at half-time I’ve got to apologise for that because I ask the boys to keep their cool and stay on the pitch and in the heat of the moment I’ve reacted to a dangerous challenge.’ 

There had already been controversy at Valley Parade after Hanson got the wrong side of Millwall's Mark Beevers, who dragged him down and received a straight red within six minutes.

It went from bad to worse for Ian Holloway's side, who thanks to goals from Hanson, Stead and Andy Halliday, went into the half-time break three down and eventually lost 4-0 thanks to a Billy Knott strike to exit the FA Cup on a sour note.
