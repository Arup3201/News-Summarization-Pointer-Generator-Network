Stalwart: Former Sunday school teacher Josie Hampson denies racially harassing a group of travellers

A pensioner known for her community work will appear in court today charged with racially abusing travellers camping on green belt land.

Former Sunday school teacher Josie Hampson, 77, says she will fight to clear her name after a ‘humiliating’ ordeal in which she was fingerprinted and had her DNA taken by police.

The case comes after a long-running feud between the community and a family of travellers who want to live near Mrs Hampson’s home in Heath Charnock, near Chorley, Lancs.

The former school governor, a 
grandmother, is a local legend in her Lancashire hometown, where she has
run a toy shop for six decades and has been recognised for her services
to the area.

But she says she is ‘shocked’ and 
‘sickened’ by the accusations and has vowed to fight charges at Preston 
magistrates’ court of racially aggravated harassment and using 
threatening words or behaviour.

She said: ‘I am not a racist, I never have been a racist, and certainly never will be.

‘I am a Christian and the words I have been accused of saying would never have even entered my head.’

She added: ‘I am struggling to cope and I am feeling unwell with the worry. I just can’t imagine how it has come to this.’

The pensioner, who was given a 
‘Chorley Smile Award’ by her local council to recognise her services to 
the town, was interviewed by police in April. She said: ‘I’ve had to 
give a statement, had my fingerprints taken and my DNA.

‘I refused to have a solicitor 
because I told them that I had done nothing wrong, but now I’ve had to 
employ a criminal solicitor which is going to cost more than £1,000.

Accusation: Patty Linfoot has spent four years camped next 
to Mrs Hampson's land. Her family are suing after claiming to have been 
called 'dirty gyppos'

It’s not going to be easy, but I will have to pluck up the courage to stand trial as I am completely innocent.’

The Linfoot family have been locked in a four-year battle to remain on green belt land near Mrs Hampson’s home.

Despite attempts to evict them, costing the taxpayer tens of  thousands of pounds, they were this week given a two-year stay of execution while Chorley Council starts a full report into the needs of travellers in the area.

They are expected to be allowed to use the site temporarily in  the meantime.

Michael Linfoot said he hopes the report is ‘thorough’, adding: ‘We’ll continue to look for sites in Chorley to move to.’

The row comes after players at nearby Hoghton Cricket Club formed a 24-hour barricade to force travellers off their pitch.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
