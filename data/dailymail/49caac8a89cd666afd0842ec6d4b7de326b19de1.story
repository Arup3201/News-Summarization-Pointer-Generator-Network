Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland has said no decision has been taken on whether the first Test against India will go ahead next week as Australia mourns the loss of batsman Phillip Hughes.

Australia were due to begin the first of four Tests in Brisbane next Thursday but that has now been cast into doubt following the death of Hughes on Thursday.

Hughes, who would have turned 26 on Sunday, died of the injuries he sustained two days after being struck in the head by a bouncer while batting for South Australia against New South Wales at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

His plight has sent shockwaves through cricket and understandably Cricket Australia is keen to avoid rushing into a decision over whether the team will take to the field at the Gabba next week.

Sutherland said at a media conference: 'Cricket will go on and it will go on when we're ready.

'We haven't broached that subject with the players yet, we will in time but to be honest they've got other things on their mind.

'I know for many people seven days doesn't seem too far away but in other ways, it's a million miles away. We'll get there when we can.' 

The BCCI will wait for Australia to arrive at a decision.

'I am in constant touch with my Cricket Australia counterparts. We want them to first get over the trauma,' BCCI secretary Sanjay Patel told Reuters.

'After that we can decide on the fate of the first test.'

Pat Howard, Cricket Australia's executive general manager of team performance, confirmed the Test team had travelled to the Sydney Cricket Ground (SCG) on Friday to grieve for Hughes.

And Howard stressed that the focus is on the individuals rather than the sport.

'We're not going to talk about the first Test, we know it's there,' he said. 'What we're focused on is today. 

'We've brought the whole team in, the whole Australian Test team are here. Today's about grieving.

'In regards to anything we do do, we need to make sure the players are in a position where they can make strong choices and that's not now, that's not this time.

'We'll do whatever we can, whatever the players need, to deal and cope with this, we'll do whatever we can to help and support the Hughes family.

'We're going to focus on people first rather than the cricket.'

Sutherland said Sean Abbott - the bowler who struck Hughes in the domestic match on Tuesday - is coping 'really well'.

While there has been an outpouring of grief following Hughes' death, Abbott has been consoled by former and current professionals and fans alike amid concerns he may never play again.

But Sutherland said: 'It's been fantastic the way people have shown concern for Sean. Sean is holding up really well, I'm incredibly impressed by the way he's holding himself and his maturity.

'It's a grieving process that will affect people in different ways. Right now, he's holding up really and I'm incredibly impressed with him.'
