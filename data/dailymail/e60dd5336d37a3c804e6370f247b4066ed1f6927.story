A young mother whose father killed himself two days before he was due to stand trial for her murder was found dead by a group of children, an inquest heard.

The skull of Victoria Couchman, 19, were found by the youngsters in woodland in St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex, five months after she had disappeared.

But despite being missing for so long, none of her friends or family had reported her missing.

Yesterday a coroner ruled that she had been unlawfully killed.

'Unlawfully killed': Victoria Couchman, 19, was found dead in woodland by a group of children, the inquest heard

Police found more human remains nearby including her femur and pelvis after the children stumbled across her skull in October 2008.

The single mother's father Tony Couchman, 46, killed himself in his prison cell just before he was due to stand trial at Lewes Crown Court, the inquest in Hastings was told.

East Sussex coroner Alan Craze said it was 'one of the most significant and difficult' cases he had dealt with.

The murder case against her father Tony was 'circumstantial', the coroner was told.

As the single mother's remains had been left exposed for several months a cause of death could not be determined - although the pathologist said she may have been strangled.

But Detective Chief Inspector Adam Hibbert, from Sussex Police’s major crime branch, said that 'taken cumulatively' there was 'good reason' for Couchman to be charged and to stand trial.

The inquest heard that Couchman was suspected to have sent text messages purporting to be from his daughter after she had been killed.

These included texts sent to her mother, Fiona Masters, with whom Couchman had split, saying she had set up home with a new boyfriend.

Mr Hibbert said: 'A text expert examined the texts purporting to be sent by Victoria. He came to the view that it was very likely that the texts were sent by Tony.'

A phone used to send texts claiming to be from Ms Couchman had been bought by a man fitting her father’s description at a shop.

A walking stick was also bought, which Couchman had cause to use.

Other reasons to suspect she had been killed included the fact that her body had possibly been concealed, and that she had not taken any money or possessions with her.

There was also no contact with friends or family, including her own daughter, and there were 'lies and inconsistencies' in Couchman’s accounts to police, Mr Hibbert said.

Couchman had told police that he had not reported her missing because she had vanished on previous occasions and was on a final warning with social services.

He claimed to fear that social services would take away his grandchild but the authorities denied to police that she had been given a 'final warning'.

According to Mr Hibbert, Couchman had 11 convictions ranging from theft to firearms offences.

At around the time of her disappearance, Ms Couchman was seen outside the house she shared with her father in St Leonards, and was heard to say: 'I have had enough. He’s too controlling.'

Later that day, a neighbour called at her home and was told by Couchman that she had gone out.

Mr Hibbert said the prosecution would have said at trial that Couchman had disposed of her body in his car, which he sold 12 days later.

He also said he had lost his mobile phone shortly after she disappeared, which police said would have been of important evidential value.

Linda Piper, deputy general manager of surgery at the Conquest Hospital in St Leonards-on-Sea, said that Ms Couchman had surgery following a car crash in which her brother Dean, 17, died in November 2005.

This resulted in her being fitted with pins and screws with a unique reference number which helped identify her, along with dental records.
