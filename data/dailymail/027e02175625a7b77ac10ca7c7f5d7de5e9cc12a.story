Preparing to fight the Taliban together is not, perhaps, the most conventional start to married life.

But then Corporal Benham Cook, 26, and his Lance Corporal wife Sara, 23, from Blurton, Staffordshire, met through the Territorial Army's 123 Ammunition Squadron in Stoke-on-Trent three years ago. So they always knew it was a possibility.

Though perhaps even they didn't think their deployment to Afghanistan would come so soon - one year after getting married.

Happy anniversary! Sara and Benham think they are luckier than most soldiers who have to leave their civilian partners at home

In sickness and in health: Sara and Benham Cook, from Blurton, Staffordshire, will spend the first half of 2013 on the Helmand Province front line with a group of 25 soldiers from the 159 Supply Regiment

The couple, who married on 28 January last year, are celebrating their first wedding anniversary together by starting 
military training ahead of being sent to
Afghanistan for a six-month tour of Helmand Province in March.

So instead of settling into their 
second year of married life with gravy boats and plans for babies, the 
Cooks will spend the first half of 2013 fighting the Taliban with a 
group of 25 soldiers from the 159 Supply Regiment - who are helping 
regular troops in an effort to drive out insurgents.

They are currently training for their upcoming mission which will involve supplying ammunition and equipment to front line troops.

And despite being posted to Camp Bastion together, Benham and Sara are likely to be given separate duties, meaning the will only see each other at evening meals.

Sara, who graduated from Keele University in 2011, joined the Army on the advice of her brother Nathan, who is also a Lance Corporal and served in Afghanistan.

The Cookies: The couple, who married on 28 January last year, have been nicknamed 'The Cookies' by their TA colleagues

Happily ever after: Sara and Benham Cook on their wedding day in January 2012, just one year before they began training in preparation for being deployed together to Afghanistan

Married life: Rather than spending their first anniversary having a romantic meal, Sara and Benham Cook will be training for an upcoming six-month tour of Helmand Province

Sara, from Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said: 'I'm really excited, as well as a little nervous. This is what we train for and, as a soldier, I think it's something you have to experience.

'Although being in the TA means we don't see each other as much as we like, I actually think it has brought us closer together - it's a passion for both of us.

'My family are very supportive, but a bit worried, so it's comforting to them that my husband will be out there to look out for me.

'We are luckier than most in that we will be together during our training but if we are separated out there, it could be difficult, especially if one of us goes outside the wire.

'That said though, at least we will know what the other one is thinking and I imagine it will be easier than waiting at home.'

Happy days: Lieutenant Colonel Colin Francis, who selected the couple for the tour, said 'they are both excellent soldiers' and 'make a brilliant team'

Husband Benham, who is in his eighth year with the TA and served in Iraq in 2007, added: 'I joined because I saw the red sign for the TA Centre while driving through the streets and wondered what it was all about.

'This is my second major deployment and I can't wait, to be honest. This is what I joined the Army for.

'I can't wait to get out there. Being in a relationship with someone in the Army has obvious difficulties, but when you're both in the Army, it brings an entirely new set of problems.

'It would almost be easier for me if Sara was at home so I would know she was safe, especially if one of us has to go outside the wire.

'Having said that, at least I know I'm close enough to get to get to her if something bad should happen and weâ€™ll see each other for short periods of time.

'We do have a bit of banter, but we're like a big family and everyone has been very supportive.'

The couple have been nicknamed The Cookies by their TA colleagues.

Lieutenant Colonel Colin Francis, who selected the couple for the tour, said: 'I've watched them get to know each other over the years.

'They make a brilliant team. They are both excellent soldiers and will serve us well in Afghanistan.'

Together forever: Sara and Benham are both excited about being sent to Afghanistan, and hope they will be able to see each other when they are out there
