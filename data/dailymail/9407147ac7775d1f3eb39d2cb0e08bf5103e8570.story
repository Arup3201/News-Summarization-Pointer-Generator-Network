Banksy appears to be trying to win New York back by helping raise money for a local charity with his latest artwork.

The elusive artist has taken a painting from a charity shop and added a seated Nazi officer before returning it to the same shop and allowing them to auction it off for a six-figure sum.

The British street artist took his cues from The Thomas Crown Affair remake as he purchased a painting from the Housing Works shop on 23rd Street before adding his own spin to the work and donating it back to the same store.

Banksy bought this painting from a charity shop and then added the Nazi officer and signed his signature below that of the original artist, titling his new piece 'The Banality Of The Banality Of Evil'

Drawing a crowd: Throughout the day on Tuesday, spectators began to realize that the picture hanging in the charity shop window was actually made by the famed graffiti artist

The store is now auctioning the piece off online for six-figures, the subject matter may ruffle some feathers.

The original landscape picture showed sun breaking through clouds above an unspecified mountain range by a river in the woods.

Banksy then added a Nazi officer with his back facing the viewer, sitting on a bench looking at the scene.

As verification, the artist posted a picture of the work to his website where he chronicles his daily contribution to New York's art scene.

He titled the work 'The Banality Of The Banality Of Evil' on his website.

He also added his signature beneath that of the original artist, K. Sager.

A spokesperson from Housing Works has confirmed the sale and said that they had no idea who the man was when he dropped off the painting.

'I don't know all the details, it was all done very secretively. But someone came in and dropped it off as an anonymous donation,' Housing Work's Rebecca Edmondson told The New York Post.

The charity, which is dedicated to helping end homelessness and those living with HIV/Aids, received a call confirming the Banksy connection on Tuesday.

It is being sold via an online charity aution website. It was initially listed Tuesday evening with a starting price of $76,000 according to The Village Voice. As of 11pm local time, it was already up to $201,200.

The painting is being monitored by 
security and displayed in the window of the 23rd Street branch until 
online bidding stops at 8pm on Thursday October 31.

Protecting the goods: A security guard will be posted in front of the painting until an online auction is completed on Thursday evening. The price is already up to six-figures

That also marks the last day of the British artist's self-imposed 'residency' in New York, where he debuted a new piece of art every day during the month.

One exception was made on October 23 when he posted on his website that the day's art had 'been cancelled due to police activity'.

His new philanthropic turn comes after he penned an op-ed slamming the 'Freedom Tower' design that is being built as a replacement for the World Trade Center. His critique- where he called the building a 'shyscrapper'- landed him in hot water, but he is now earning back goodwill by helping out one of the city's most popular charities.

'It’s such a great gesture, what he did today is really special. He may be controversial,  but there is no controversy in the fact that it goes to something good,' Ms Edmondson told The Post.

'This is one of the coolest things that has happened to us in a long time.'
