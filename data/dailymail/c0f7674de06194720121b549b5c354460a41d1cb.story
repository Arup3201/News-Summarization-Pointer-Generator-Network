The carriage horse who tragically died in the street as bystanders watched was today revealed to have been in severe pain before it collapsed.

White horse Charlie, 15, keeled over as he made a morning commute from his stables to Central Park in Manhattan, New York, on October 23.

Now an autopsy of the horse whose death prompted huge public grief shows he had chronic ulcers in his stomach and a fractured tooth.

Tragic: The New York carriage horse collapsed and died in the street as it made the early morning commute from its stables to Central Park to begin its shift

The American Society for the 
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA) performed the autopsy at 
Cornell University in Ithaca, New York.

Charlie was a newcomer to the industry after being transferred from an Amish farm just weeks before he died, reported Gawker.

‘We are very concerned that Charlie was forced to work in spite of painful maladies,’ ASPCA spokesman Dr Pamela Corey said.

She said these health issues can be 
tricky to diagnose because the horse would not be ‘displaying signs of 
pain until they are very severe’.

Outrage: Campaigners argue that the number of collisions and the suffering of the animals make the cost of the industry too high

Dead: The horse that died in New York on October 23 is covered with a tarpaulin before being loaded into a police vehicle

The death fuelled the argument of 
animal rights activists for the 220 horses to be taken off the streets 
in New York permanently.

Around 100 people were at a vigil for
 Charlie on Friday, including New York Senator Tony Avella and 
Rep. Linda Rosenthal, reported DNA Info.

A Friends of Animals spokesman told 
DNA Info that the horses are ‘just commodified’ and their welfare is 
‘never going to be a priority’.

But New York City Mayor Michael 
Bloomberg defended the practice, saying: ‘Most of them wouldn’t have 
been alive if they didn’t have a job.’

The famous horses work nine hour 
shifts, after making the two mile journey from their stables to Central 
Park, where they pick up tourists.

But campaigners argue that the stress of the work and the inadequate stabling causes the horses to live short miserable lives.

'Healthy horses do not drop dead on the street,’ Elizabeth Forel of the Coalition to Ban Horse-Drawn Carriages told Mail Online.

‘Shouldn't the driver have been more sensitive to this horse and noticed that something was wrong?'

A Horse and Carriage Association 
of New York spokesman said: 'It's not something that happens regularly -
 our horses are taken care of.'
