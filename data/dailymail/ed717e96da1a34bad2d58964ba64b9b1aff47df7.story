Harry Kane has rivalled one of the world's best players by scoring eight goals in 10 games this year

Former Tottenham chairman Lord Alan Sugar insists the club will be powerless to prevent Harry Kane from leaving White Hart Lane amid interest from Real Madrid.

The 21-year-old former academy striker has arguably been this season's Premier League revelation - scoring 23 goals in all competitions to earn the trust of manager Mauricio Pochettino and stand on the verge of a first England call.

Kane - who inspired Spurs to a 2-1 victory over north London rivals Arsenal at the weekend - has recently signed a new five-and-a-half-year deal, but has emerged as a target for La Liga leaders Real Madrid.

And, Sugar believes that there is nothing Tottenham will be able to do should Kane decide to follow world record transfer Gareth Bale to the Bernabeu. 

'You don't have to accept any sort of money for a player,' he told talkSPORT. 

'The big issue people miss out is the untenable pressure that is placed upon a club when a player wants to leave. Then the money becomes irrelevant.

'In the case of Gareth Bale there must have been conversations where Tottenham said, 'If it's down to money, then let's have a chat'. It wasn't that though, he was given the chance to play for Real Madrid.

'That's why most players leave, just look at Michael Carrick, Dimitar Berbatov and Luka Modric.

'Harry Kane allegedly says he wants to be at the club for the rest of his life, like Matt Le Tissier at Southampton. Let us hope he is but let's be under no illusion. He will be the one that controls that.'
