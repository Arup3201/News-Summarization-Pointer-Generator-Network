Bulgaria's famous emerald green cat is looking a lot less colourful these days, after she was given a wash by worried animal lovers.

The ludicrously-coloured moggie became an internet sensation last year after she was spotted prowling through the popular seaside resort of Varna, on the Black Sea. 

But all that remains of her former garish tone is slightly green ears and a patch on her chest - although her fur has kept a slightly grass-like glow.

People originally feared the cat, who is often seen with a ginger feline thought to be her son, was the butt of a cruel joke.

But it was later realised the green shine was thanks to paint at the nearby construction yard where she sleeps.

Some worried her fame had a dark side when she disappeared for three days last autumn.

Residents feared she had been abducted - although others insisted that rain had washed the animal's colour away and said a similar-looking green cat was seen last year.

However, it seems locals weren't willing to take the risk of losing her again - so an animal rescue team stepped in to give her a wash.

Animal protection agencies are hoping that the stand-out nature of the feline won't influence owners to paint their cats.

The RSPCA has warned that dyeing or painting animals for cosmetic reasons could have 'potentially fatal consequences'.

Some locals were quoted as saying they believe the stray cat was becoming greener each day, fuelling the idea that someone was painting it.

Varna is a popular tourist destination as it is the largest city and seaside resort on the Bulgarian Black Sea Coast.
