Former Premier League footballer and England player Sol Campbell says attitudes towards black footballers in Britain are so full of prejudice that he will have to move abroad to fulfill his ambition of becoming a coach or manager.

Campbell, who won 73 caps as a defender for England and two Premier League titles when he played for Arsenal, said he is likely to pursue his new career across Europe because of the 'archaic attitudes' in the domestic game.

The 39-year-old, who retired in May 2012 following a 19-year footballing career to take a coaching course, said: 'There are no opportunities for me here, not until attitudes change anyway.

Attitude: Sol Campbell said the way black managers were viewed in the British game was 'archaic'

He told the Guardian: 'I want to start abroad.

'Everyone
has to ask themselves why there are not more black managers in this 
country and why the likes of Brian Deane have to go abroad (to Sarpsborg
08 in Norway) to get a chance.

'I've spoken to other black players who want to coach and they feel the same, that attitudes here are archaic.

'I hope and pray the environment changes.'

There
are only four black managers throughout the English game: 
Norwich's Chris Hughton, Charlton's Chris Powell, Paul Ince of Blackpool
and Notts County's Chris Kiwomya.

Campbell had hoped his first steps into coaching could come within the England setup, but he says their approach soon 'went cold'.

He believes their attitude could be summed up by the fact that they went on to appoint the equally inexperienced Gary Neville, who was also a regular in the England defence in which Campbell so heavily featured, as assistant manager.

'I gave my heart and soul for the national team but the FA were not there for me when I had problems,' he said.

'It's obvious they want nice people who won't cause them any problems. I put out an olive branch and it got broken, but whatever, I'm ready to move on.'
