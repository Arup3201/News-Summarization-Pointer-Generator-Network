Sunday night's episode of Mad Men saw Sally Draper spend a trial night at boarding school - a desperate bid to avoid spending future weekends with her father after catching him with his mistress.

It wasn't just any boarding school though. Like most details in Mad Men, there is a real-life historical context, and the choice of Miss Porter's, the prestigious Farmington, Connecticut finishing school that today charges $48,500 a term for boarders, is no different.

Early in the episode, Sally's mother, Betty Francis, tells her ex-husband, Don Draper, that it was the school Jacqueline Kennedy had attended.

Escape? The latest episode of Mad Men saw Sally Draper spend a night at Miss Porter's boarding school in Farmington, Connecticut, in a bid to avoid future weekends with her father

And the former first lady is not the only famous alumna. Since it was founded in 1843, Miss Porter's has been responsible for the education of leading female academics and socialites alike, including members of the Rockefeller and Vanderbilt families.

We know that just two decades before Sally's fictional visit, a 16-year-old Jackie penned love letters to then-boyfriend  R. Beverley Corbin, a student at Harvard, on Miss Porter's headed paper.

Showing a degree of teenage melodrama that could just as easily have been part of Sally's Mad Men script, she wrote:  'If these are the happiest days of your life, I'm hanging myself with my skip rope tonight.'

In
 another, she tells 'Bev darling' that when she goes to parties during a school 
holiday in New York, she'll 'make the hours that you stay up look like 
the curfew for a two-year-old' and that over Christmas she 'can commute 
happily between my doting parents until they both get sick of me.'

It seems that Jackie was regarded as a model student though. For years afterwards, former student Victoria Mudd tells Vanity Fair, she was held up as an example for girls to follow.

'Miss Watson never ceased rubbing our noses in the fact that Jackie 
would have gotten it right, that Jackie would have said that correctly,' she said.

'They were very much, in the early 60s, preparing us for life in the 1930s. It was a man’s world'

Shedding light on the type of environment Sally might have experienced, Beth Gutcheon, author of The New Girls, a novel based on Miss Porter's, told the magazine's same 2009 article that  'they were very much, in the early 60s, preparing us for life in the 1930s.

'It was a man’s world,' she wrote. 'And Farmington was making it clear to us that we
 should learn to survive and learn to be our best selves within those 
strictures.'

The year Sally would have visited, 
however, the school was going through its own major changes: in 1968, 
Miss Porter's enrolled its first black student, Glenda Newell.

Now
 a doctor in San Francisco, Dr Newell-Harris tells Vanity Fair how 
then-headmaster Richard Davis told her that the school was 'taking a 
chance' on her.

Names of note: Famous alumni also include Gloria Vanderbilt, who graduated from Mis Porter's in 1941

'If I did well they would then believe what they had heard, which 
was that many people of color may not be good test takers but could be 
good students,' she recalled. 'And so, therefore, I had that burden.'

It would seem that Dr Newell-Harris had a warmer reception than Sally, who found that students embraced her - more so, even, than their parents.

But Miss Porter's had a tough reputation by all accounts.

RoseAnne and Robert Keep, who were headteachers between 1917 and 1943, apparently forbade students from
 playing cards, chewing gum, reading popular novels and leaving the 
school grounds without permission. They breakfasted at 7am and were 
forbidden from touching their hair at mealtimes or crumbling cookies 
into ice cream.

And indeed there would be no cookies 
or ice cream if a girl was deemed overweight. There was a 'fat table' 
and 'thin table' at mealtimes for girls who the school felt needed to 
lose or gain weight, Hill Street Blues actress Barbara Babcock, who graduated in 1955, says.

There were also reports of hazing for
 new girls - and a recent lawsuit accusing the school of allowing ritual
 bullying to take place.

In 2008, former student Tatum Bass claimed she had a nervous 
breakdown following harassment from a secret student society of 'Keepers
 of Tradition' who call themselves the Oprichniki after Ivan the Terrible's secret police.

Miss Bass, who was expelled for 
cheating on an art history test, claims she was villified by these Mean 
Girls after suggesting that Miss Porter's students participate in a 
multi-school prom, and was branded 'retarded' over her attention deficit
 disorder.

A hit with the Mean Girls: Such drama apparently impresses the Miss Porter's girls, as Betty later informs Sally that she has earned herself glowing reviews

Former student Amos M. Nevin, who graduated from Miss Porter's in 1990,
 told the New York Times how the fearsome name came about.

'We learned about
 the 16th-century Russian Oprichniki in A.P. European history,' she 
said. 'At the time, as precocious 
teenagers, it seemed like a clever idea to name ourselves' because it was 'underground and cryptic.'

There were other scandals that rocked the school too. In 1976, an apparently overweight student gave birth to a baby boy in a bathroom. The situation was only discovered afterwards when the girl began bleeding heavily, and the infant's body was later found.

And earlier this year, a former teacher was accused of having sex with a 17-year-old student in a classroom closet.

Joseph Rajkumar,  42, who taught physics and coached soccer and track since August 2009, was fired on March 4 and charged with sexual assault following claims that he had been making advances on the girl since she was 15 and had sexually inappropriate conversations and text messages with at least five other students ages 15 to 18.

Regardless of bad press, the school's
 alumni, or Ancients as they are known to each other, remain fiercely 
loyal to their school.

Sarah Hart Hansen, who graduated in 1974, told the New York Times: 'The
 traditions aren’t really sinister. Maybe there’s nervousness in the beginning, but it’s a 
bonding moment.'

Of course, 
as the Mad Men episode proved, an elite reputation does not prevent 
mischief - and the antics of Sally and her dorm-mates Mandy and 
Millicent were typical of girls at boarding school today.

In a bid to impress the two existing 
students with whom she is sharing a room and will cast verdict on her after the stay, Sally invites her friend
 Glen Bishop, who brings alcohol, marijuana - and a friend - to get a dorm 
room party started.

When Glen disappears into a room with Mandy, however, his friend tries to seduce Sally with the words: 'I've been with lots of girls. I know what I'm doing.'

Sally
 is not won over though, and when he gets pushy, she calls on Glen to 
rescue her, prompting a fist-fight between the two boys before they are 
made to leave for fear that a teacher will hear them.

Such
 drama apparently impresses the Miss Porter's girls, though, as Betty 
later informs Sally that she has earned herself glowing reviews.

But whether Miss Porter's will prove the escape Sally so desires remains to be seen.

Clearly both her parents' daughter, she can hold her own - the desire to run to boarding school, though, may see her thrown from the frying pan into the fire.
