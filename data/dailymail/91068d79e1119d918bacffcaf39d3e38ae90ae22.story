For the price of just £125, they bought an acre of land on which to build their first home.

Sixty years on, Rhys and Audrey Probert are still living on the plot - and it is now worth £350,000.

Mr Probert, now 82, was just 22 when he bought the expanse of land in the village of Osbaston, Monmouthshire, to make a home with his then-fiancée.

Couple: Rhys Probert (pictured with his wife, Audrey) was just 22 when he paid £125 for an acre of land  in the village of Osbaston, Monmouthshire. He then spent a further £1,000 building a bungalow for him and Audrey

Renovated: When it was built, the modest bungalow featured only one bedroom, a bathroom, a kitchen and no carpet nor central heating. But now, it has been transformed into a 2,570sq ft home (above) worth £350,000

Pool: Over the past six decades, the Proberts have extended and added to the property. Above, the couple are pictured at a younger age with their children in a swimming pool that they built at the back of the bungalow

He then spent a further £1,000 - all he could afford - building a modest bungalow, featuring only one bedroom, a bathroom, a kitchen and no carpet nor central heating

But over the past six decades, he and his wife have transformed the property into a 2,570 sq ft home, with three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a conservatory and even a swimming pool.

Today, Mrs Probert, 80, said the couple had worked 'night and day' to create their perfect home.

“It really is the house that love built,' said the grandmother-of-four.

'We have spent 60 happy years making memories in this house and will stay here until the end of our days.'

Mr Probert, a retired postman, added: 'We have come an awful long way from the home we first built.

'We had no carpets, no central heating, we had quarry tiles on the floor that were cold as ice.

'There was a tiny kitchen and bathroom and one bedroom. The whole house was probably just 64 square metres.

Trasnformed Mr Probert, a retired postman, said: 'We have come a long way from the home we first built'

Luxury: The couple's outdoor swimming pool is a far cry from the first home they built together in 1950

'Then as we got more established in our jobs and as we settled down to have children we slowly started to expand.'

Now, the couple's house is worth a whopping £350,000 - more than 300 times what they originally paid to build it - based on the sales of similar local properties.

Mrs Probert said: 'All those years ago it cost us £1,000 in building materials and labour to put the house up in its original state.

'That was a lot of money then but it wouldn’t get you much today.

Garden: The couple's house is worth a whopping £350,000 - more than 300 times what they originally paid to build it - based on the sales of similar local properties. Above, part of the property's garden

'We later extended to make room for our first child in 1962 so there was a nursery.

“As our family grew so did the house. By 1969 we had two children and an outdoor swimming pool for them to play in.'

As the years passed and their children flew the nest Audrey and Rhys decided to sell part of their land to reduce their workload in the garden and free up some finances so they could travel.

'We stay very active but an acre of land was an awful lot to maintain,' said Mrs Probert.

'About 10 years ago we decided to sell half of our plot to a builder. We used the money to go to Australia and Rhys completed 2 A levels in German and Art.

Proud: The Proberts said their home has remained 'modest and comfortable and filled with happy memories'

'Soon the builder finished developing the land and the end result was a spectacular house which sold for £600,000.

'Over the years this area had become quite affluent and our little hamlet is now a desirable address.

'It’s wonderful that we are still here after all these years. When we first moved in there was nothing for miles around, just fields and trees.'

'It’s a very different world now but our home has stayed the same -  modest and comfortable and filled with happy memories.'
