President Barack Obama bungled the response to the Islamic State and 'waited too long' to engage the terrorist group, the nation's 39th president, Jimmy Carter, said Tuesday.

Obama's current approach to fighting ISIS in Iraq has a 'possibility of success,' Carter added, but only if ground troops do their part.

Carter, a Democrat who served as president for one term in the late seventies, held little back when asked about the current occupant of the White House by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram on Tuesday.

The retired politician said he supported Obama's candidacy but disagrees with the way he's handled several foreign policy issues, including the ascent of ISIS.

'First of all, we waited too long [to get involved],' he said. 'We let the Islamic State build up its money, capability and strength and weapons while it was still in Syria.

'Then when [ISIS] moved into Iraq, the Sunni Muslims didn’t object to their being there and about a third of the territory in Iraq was abandoned.'

Carter seemed skeptical that Obama's current plan of attack would yield the desired result.

'If we keep on working in Iraq and have some ground troops to follow up when we do our bombing, there is a possibility of success,' he stated. He did not indicate who should supply the soldiers, the U.S., Iraq or some other country.

Ground forces are also needed in Syria, Carter said.

'You have to have somebody on the ground to direct our missiles and to be sure you have the right target. Then you have to have somebody to move in and be willing to fight ISIS after the strikes,' he explained.

President Obama and his administration have already set to work on recruiting moderate rebels of the government to serve as the United States' eyes and ears on the ground in Syria. 

Before Congress left Washington for an extended recess last month, it authorized a weapons and training program for members of the Free Syrian Army. 

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel told lawmakers that the effort would result in the training of 5,000 rebels each year who are capable of taking on the Islamic State.

During his wide-ranging interview with the Fort-Worth Star Telegram at a Habitat for Humanity work site, Carter, who recently celebrated his 90th birthday, Carter also offered a negative assessment of Obama's policies in the Middle East more broadly.

Part of the problem with Obama's approach, Carter said, is that it's been inconsistent.

'It changes from time to time,' he said. 'I noticed that two of his secretaries of defense, after they got out of office, were very critical of the lack of positive action on the part of the president.'

Carter was referring to  former administration officials Leon Panetta and Robert Gates. Both of have released unflattering memoirs on their time working for Obama since retiring from government service.

Panetta's book, Worthy Fights: A Memoir of Leadership in War and Peace, was released just yesterday. In promoting it, he derided Obama in numerous times for not arming rebels in Syria sooner and for refusing to leave troops behind in Iraq when the U.S. ended its years long occupation of the country.

Carter also noted his opposition to Obama's drone program.

'I really object to the killing of people, particularly Americans overseas who haven’t been brought to justice and put on trial,' he said. 

'We’ve killed four Americans overseas with American drones. To me that violates our Constitution and human rights.' 

When it comes to replacing Obama in 2017, the year his second and final term will come to an end, Carter was slightly more reserved, however.

'It’s too early to speculate about the next presidential election,' he stated. 

'I think Hillary [Clinton] is a real possibility,' he noted, but didn't give any clues as to whether she'd have his support in the primary.

'Whoever the Democratic candidate is, the Carter family will vote for them,' the former president said.
