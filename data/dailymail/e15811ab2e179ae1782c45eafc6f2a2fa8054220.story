When first-time mother Sarah Sharples found out she was expecting a girl, she was determined that her daughter would want for nothing.

In her excitement, the 25-year-old managed to spend £3,000 on clothes, toys and nursery furniture, all in the most girlish shade of pink.

Trouble was, when the big day finally came, the 'little princess' they were expecting turned out to be a little boy.

Pretty in pink: Sarah Sharples and her husband Lee were told by doctors they were expecting a baby girl so spent £3,000 on pretty baby essentials... but then she gave birth to a little boy and is now stuck with a wardrobe full of pink clothes

Is that you, Lily-Mae: When baby Joseph was born he was quite a surprise, not only because he was a little bit early, but also because he was a boy... and his parents thought he was going to be a girl

So now Sarah, who lives in Blyth, 
Northumberland, with husband Lee, 37, who had already eagerly decorated the pink nursery with stencils of their supposed daughter's chosen name, Lily-Mae - are adapting all their preparations to make them more suitable for their new son, Joseph.

Sarah said: 'I couldn't understand it when the midwife said it was a boy. All our scans had confirmed it was a girl and I had everything prepared in pink.

'We had picked her name, Lily-Mae, and had the room decorated with her name stencilled across the pink feature wall. We even had personalised blankets as gifts from family and friends.'

When Sarah found out she was pregnant, she and Lee decided they wished to know the baby's sex so they could be fully prepared for everything to come.

Discovering it was a girl meant the forward-thinking couple could purchase all they needed for their 'little princess'.

A room fit for a little princess: The nursery was designed for Lily-Mae, and even had her name stencilled on the walls, but it has now been decorated with Monsters Inc to make it more suitable for Joseph

Every girl's dream wardrobe: Little Lily-Mae already had a closet full of pretty dresses and fluffy booties before she was born... but then little Joseph came along instead

Mother-to-be: The eager couple spent £3.000 on their unborn daughter, and were even give a personalised blanket embroidered with her name, Lily-Mae

Friends and family bought lots of pink clothes and accessories as gifts, and their own spending began to mount up too.

But Sarah always knew having a baby wasn't going to be cheap, so the couple were happy to spend the money.

She said: 'It was my first baby and so we had to buy all the essentials.

'I wanted everything to be perfect for her so that she would want for nothing. Being prepared was my main concern, and seeing as I knew I was having a girl I didn't see the harm in buying everything in pink.'

Little princess? Luckily the couple bought most of the clothes in Asda, who let them take them back and exchange little dresses for dungarees and blue T-shirts for baby Joseph

Sarah said: 'The midwife said to Lee that there was something we needed to see. I instantly started panicking thinking what could possibly be wrong. She then said she wanted to congratulate us on the birth of our son'

Joseph's new room: The couple's baby now has a Monsters Inc.-themed room

And when Sarah went into labour four weeks early, she knew everything was ready for their new arrival.

But when the midwife went to hand the newborn to her she couldn’t believe what she was hearing.

Sarah said: 'The midwife said to Lee that there was something we needed to see.

'I instantly started panicking thinking what could possibly be wrong. She then said she wanted to congratulate us on the birth of our son.

'We looked at each other and couldn't believe that Lily-Mae was actually a boy.

'We decided to name him Joseph as we didn't think he would appreciate the name Lily-Mae.'

Sarah and Lee then had to start the mammoth task of trying to get back the staggering £3,000 they had spent so that they could get Joseph everything he would need.

So prepared: The couple were very pleased with themselves for preparing so well for the birth of their daughter

Do you know who I am: Doctors told Sarah that she was definitely expecting a girl when they gave her her 20-week scan

Lee said: 'There was so much to change and friends and family have been so helpful.

'We had bought most of the clothes from ASDA and they were fantastic and let us exchange everything.

'But we still have a lot of pink things that we can't return and so we’re just keeping them and hoping, at some stage, we have a girl.

'The nursery is now redecorated with a Monsters Inc. theme, so we think Joseph will prefer that to a pink room.'

I'm SURE it's a girl: Doctors were wrong about the sex of the couple's baby... as he turned out to be a boy

Baby love: Sarah and Lee were surprised to meet baby Joseph, but thrilled nonetheless
