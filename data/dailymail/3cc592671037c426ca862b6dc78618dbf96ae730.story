Dog attack: Maddison Green was forced to have 80 stitches after being mauled by her grandparents' dog

A three-year-old girl was left needing 80 stitches in her face after she was mauled by a husky dog in her grandmother's home - sparking a bitter family row.

Maddison Green was forced to undergo a two-hour operation after being attacked by the pet as she was being taken bed in Newport, South Wales.

Her grandmother’s partner is
refusing to have his husky - called Zeus - put down despite the attack.

If the incident had happened in a 
public place the dog could have been put down - but the law does not 
apply on private land. The government has pledged to removed the 
loophole next year.

Maddison’s father Craig said Zeus jumped forwards and bit into her face last Saturday.

After
 she was treated at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport he has called 
for the dog to be put down - but his own stepfather Dave Sellwood, 41, 
has said no.

Craig Green, 
28, of Porth, Rhondda, said: 'I cannot believe that there is nothing we 
can do to prevent this dog from attacking again.

'My stepfather is refusing to put the dog down. He regards it like a child. But it could have killed my daughter.

'He
 has no children of his own, but Maddison has been brought up to call 
him grandad. I cannot believe he is putting the dog first.'

Dog owners cannot be prosecuted if their pet attacks a person if the attack takes place on private land.

The Dangerous Dogs Act currently only covers 'maulings' in public places.

However, the government has vowed to change the law after 14-year-old Jade Anderson was killed.

No one could be prosecuted for the attack by four bull mastiff-type dogs in Athertron, Greater Manchester, because it happened on private land.

Under the law, introduced in 1991, it is an offence to be the owner of a dog that was dangerously out of control in a public place or a 'non-public place in which it is not permitted to be'.

The reform will change the wording of the law to cover all attacks, regardless of where they take place.

Mr Green said changing the dangerous dogs law needs to be changed now so the husky can be destroyed.

He
 added: 'The law should be changed right now. We have to stop this from 
happening. How can a little girl be injured and no one be held 
responsible?'

Fitness trainer Mr Sellwood, 41, who lives with his wife Catherine, has told Craig there is 'no point' in putting the dog down now.

Mr Green said: 'He has told me and my partner that now the attack has happened there is no point in killing his pet. But it is totally absurd. The husky could have killed Maddison.'

On the night of the attack last Saturday Maddison was staying with her grandmother.

Mr Green and his partner, Cerys Shirley, 24, had left her with their son David, four, and his brother’s children to stay the night.

Mr Green added: 'When we got the call 
about what had happened it was horrible. Cerys is devastated - it seems 
utterly unfair that no one is responsible for this in the eyes of the 
law.'

More than 6,400 people
 a year are admitted into British hospitals for micro-surgery to 
life-changing injuries caused by dogs. One in six victims is under ten.

Mr
 Sellwood said: 'Craig wasn’t even here when it happened, whatever he 
says is just hearsay. Apart from that, I’ve got nothing else to say.'
