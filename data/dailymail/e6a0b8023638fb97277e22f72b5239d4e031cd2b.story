Ground zero: News of the World reporters allegedly tried to hack phones of 9/11 victims

News of the World reporters tried to hack the voicemails of dead 9/11 victims, a former New York policeman claimed last night.

He alleged he was contacted by News of the World journalists who said they would pay him to retrieve the private phone records of the dead.

The former cop, who now works as a private investigator, said that reporters wanted British victim’s mobile numbers and details of calls in the days surrounding  the tragedy.

The voicemails are likely to have included harrowing messages from distraught relatives desperately trying to contact their loved ones in the wake of the terrorist attacks in New York in 2001.

A source told the Daily Mirror: 'This investigator is used by a lot of journalists in America and he recently told me that he was asked to hack into the 9/11 victims’ private phone data.

'He said that the journalists asked him to access records showing the calls that had been made to and from the mobile phones belonging to the victims and their ­relatives.

'His presumption was that they wanted the information so they could hack into the ­relevant voicemails, just like it has been shown they have done in the UK. The PI said he had to turn the job down. He knew how insensitive such research would be, and how bad it would look.'

The source said that the ­journalists were interested in getting the phone records belonging to the British victims of the attacks.

Under American law, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) makes it a crime for American companies to offer corrupt payments to foreign government officials.

If the allegations of payments to police officers are proven, Mr Murdoch could face an American prosecution in his role as deputy chief operating officer the US-listed News Corp.

A former New York police officer has also claimed that News of the World journalists tried to pay him for phone details of British 9/11 victims

In 2009, the former Hollywood producer Gerald Green was jailed for six months after being prosecuted under the FCPA for making $1.8m (£1.1m) in bribes to a Thai government official. Butler University law professor Mike Koehler, an FCPA expert, said: 'I would be very surprised if the U.S. authorities don't become 
involved in this News International conduct.'

He said the FCPA could be invoked because News Corp is an American company and 
because the alleged payments would have been made in order for the newspaper 
to make money from the stories obtained.

Brett Pulley, media correspondent for the Bloomberg news agency in New York, 
said: 'If the fall out were to continue, my goodness, if it were to impact 
James Murdoch, then we start to talk about it impacting News Corp’s succession plan, 
so that affects the company globally.'

Paul Farhi, media correspondent for The Washington Post, added: 'There’s a 
whole domino effect. What else falls apart? Do bankers get nervous?

'Rupert Murdoch had one flirtation with bankruptcy in the early 90s. He’s 
very dependent on the goodwill of Wall Street and of bankers.

“His company is very profitable now — it’s not quite the same as the 1990s — 
but he doesn’t want these dominoes to keep toppling …

'The fact he shut down a newspaper reflects how seriously the scandal is 
affecting a whole empire.'

In Slate.com, noted commentator Jack Shafer wrote: 'Like all reverse-ferret manoeuvres, the closing of News of the World is designed to scatter and confuse the audience. It looks like the sacrifice of something very special to him, seeing as it was his first U.K. newspaper acquisition in 1968. But it's not.

'It looks like atonement, but it's not. It's supposed to change the subject, but it's too late for that.

'The most shocking thing to me about the paper's closure is what an empty gesture it is.

'I expected much better from the genocidal tyrant.

'The tricky thing about the reverse ferret is that unless you nab the beast the moment it bursts out of a pant leg, it can be impossible to apprehend.

'From the way News Corp. is acting, it looks to me as if the Murdochs have lost control of their precious ferret. If I were Rupert Murdoch, I'd start wearing my socks over my cuffs. Ferrets will eat anything that looks and smells like meat.'

The claims came as the disgraced paper's owner Rupert Murdoch flew into London to take personal charge of the phone-hacking scandal.

He first stopped at News International's headquarters in Wapping, East London, where he arrived in a red Range Rover, a copy of the last edition of the News of the World in his hands.

Protective: Rupert Murdoch guides Rebekah Brooks away from the media as they leave his London flat

Family affairs: James Murdoch leaves his father's Mayfair apartment yesterday. He later joined Rupert Murdoch and Rebekah Brooks at the Stafford Hotel where they were expected to dine together

Later yesterday he put on an extraordinary show of support for Rebekah Brooks - apparently unconcerned about her imminent interview under police caution.

Mrs Brooks, who has twice offered to resign over the controversy, was seen entering Mr Murdoch's Mayfair apartment at around 5.30pm yesterday.

Later, when asked what was his top priority, the 80-year-old media mogul gestured to Mrs Brooks. 'She is,' he replied.

The pair spent an hour in the apartment on the day the final edition of the News of the World hit news stands.

Then, in front of hordes of photographers, Mr Murdoch walked Mrs Brooks out of the block of flats with his arm firmly around her.

They had beaming smiles as they crossed the road to the Stafford Hotel, where they were expected to dine together. They were later joined by Mr Murdoch’s son, James, the chairman of News International.

Pictures of the 'Rupert and Rebekah show' will infuriate the victims of phone hacking and those who question her denials.

The phone hacking row erupted last week when fresh allegations emerged that News or the World journalists paid private investigators to hack into the phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler.

They are also alleged to have listened in on voice messages from the family of Soham victims Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman.

Hordes of advertisers finally abandoned the 'toxic' paper, forcing it to close, when it was revealed that they may have hacked into the phones of war dead.

A string of the paper's senior executives, including Mrs Brooks, face being quizzed as potential suspects or witnesses over their roles in the phone-hacking scandal which brought down the 168-year-old title she once edited.

Mrs Brooks is set to be questioned under caution in London in the next two weeks. She will be asked to give a full account of her actions during the period from 2000 to 2003 when she was editor.

It has also been revealed that at least nine former News of the World journalists, and three police officers, face charges over the hacking and corruption scandal.

Meanwhile, a 63-year-old man arrested on Friday has been bailed. Officers would not confirm reports he is a private investigator

The scandal has threatened Murdoch's controversial bid to take full control of BSkyB.

Labour leader Ed Miliband plans to attempt to force through a Commons vote this week that could see the deal postponed until after the police investigation into phone hacking is complete.

M<r Miliband said yesterday: 'The idea that this organisation, which has engaged in these terrible ­practices, should be allowed to take over BSkyB... without that criminal investigation having been completed, and on the basis of assurances from that self-same ­organisation… frankly that won’t wash with the public.'
