June Brown, who plays EastEnders' Dot Cotton, has revealed how a fortune teller predicted her life would be filled with great tragedy, just years before her husband committed suicide.

Ms Brown, 86, said she was told when she was 16 during a palm reading that she would experience extreme sorrow when she reached 30.

Just 14 years later, the actress's husband Johnny Garley killed himself in their bed.

June Brown, who plays EastEnders' Dot Cotton, has revealed how a fortune teller predicted the tragedy which saw her husband commit suicide

Ms Brown, who has starred in the soap since 1985, describes her grief in a serialisation of her autobiography Before the year Dot, published in the Sunday Mirror.

She said: 'At 16 I was very ­interested in palmistry. The fate line on my right palm broke into two parts that ran for a quarter of an inch on parallel tracks. I used to look at it and wonder, "What will happen?" Of course, it was Johnny’s death.'

The couple married in 1950 after meeting on the theatre circuit the previous year.

But five years later, she said the relationship began to break down after her husband admitted to having an affair with another actress - whom she names only as 'Maggie W' - a 'witty, funny girl'.

She said she was devastated by the betrayal, but admits she had also been adulterous, having had a brief fling with a fellow actor at the Mercury Theatre, in Notting Hill Gate.

Ms Brown said after she confessed to her husband, he was so distressed he threatened to kill himself by jumping out of the window .

Later, he told his wife he wished she would kill herself instead.

The actress reveals the day he died, she had been staying at her friends house 'to get a good night's sleep' after becoming physically and emotionally exhausted.

She returned to find her husband had gassed himself, and left a suicide note begging for her forgiveness and professing his love for her.

She said: 'I remember throwing the gas fire on the floor, turning it off and Mr Seward (who managed the house) and I dragged him out of the bed.

'He wasn’t breathing, but I did artificial respiration for an hour.'

She said he was taken to hospital where he briefly regained consciousness only to slip into a coma again.

The actress said she hid her husband's death from her father for three years.

June Brown has played Dot Cotton - now Branning - the chain smoking launderette worker since the soap started in 1985.

She was awarded an MBE for services to drama and charity, and has been taken to the heart of the nation for her role as the busy body bible lover Dot.
