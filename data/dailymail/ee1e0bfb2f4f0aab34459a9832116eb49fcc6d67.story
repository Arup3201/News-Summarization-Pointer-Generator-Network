Clutching on to his rescuers as he is lifted to safety, this is the incredible moment a four-year-old boy was saved from the mud that destroyed his home in the deadly Washington landslide.

Jacob Spillers was at home watching television with his father, older brother and two sisters when the mile-long slide sent his home in Snohomish County plummeting down the mountainside.

While his father and siblings have still not been found, Jacob's mud-covered blond hair was visible among the debris when a Snohomish County Helicopter flew overhead soon after.

The footage, shared on the rescuers' Facebook page, shows the aircraft getting close enough to the boy for a rescuer to hop on to a mound of mud and reach down to him.

Saved: The boy, Jacob Spillers, holds on as a rescuer scoops him from the mud and carries him to the aircraft

He carries the terrified boy to safety and passes him up to another rescuer waiting inside the helicopter.

An image shared by the team shows the little boy covered in mud and wearing only his underpants.

He had been stuck up to his knees in concrete-like compressed mud that had pulled his pants off when he was taken to safety, witnesses said.

The rescue team said on Facebook: 'Our team was 
conducting a training that morning only 25 miles south of the slide 
location and, as such, was able to arrive on scene very quickly.

'Our hearts go out to the families, friends, and loved ones of all the victims and those still lost.

'We have been flying each day since the disaster and will be back at it tomorrow to continue the rescue efforts.'

Survivor Robin Youngblood told FOX how she helped comfort the boy after the helicopter landed by telling him she was a grandma.

'He was freezing,' she added, saying she took off his wet clothes and wrapped him in a blanket.

Jacob was one of eight people who were rescued on Saturday. As many as 176 people are still missing and 24 people are confirmed dead.

Jacob's father Billy and three siblings, Brooke, Kaylee and Jovon, are still missing. The children's mother, Jonielle, was out working as a nursing assistant at the time of the slide.

'Billy and kids hold on,' she wrote on her Facebook page on Monday. 'I love you and we are waiting for you for as long as it takes. Stay strong honey.'
