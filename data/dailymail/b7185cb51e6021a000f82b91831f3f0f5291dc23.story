A 28-year-old man was accidentally shot in the face by his brother, who was slaughtering a pig for a family celebration.

Koua Vang, suffered life-threatening injuries and is now in critical condition at Kaiser Permanente South Sacramento hospital in California, police revealed.

The shooting happened at 6.25am on Saturday at Mr Vang's home in a rural part of Elk Grove.

Mr Vang's 31-year-old older brother was trying to shoot two pigs for eating later in the day, according to the Sacramento Bee.

A circle of family members, including Mr Vang, gathered around the two bound pigs while his brother took the shot.

The brother killed one pig, but when he shot the second pig, the animal lurched, hitting the .22-calibre rifle and causing the gun to discharge a second time.

Mr Vang was struck in the face at close range, police revealed, and put on life support at the hospital.

Trying to shoot quick-witted pigs often seems to end in disaster.

In April, a man from Florida accidentally shot his girlfriend in both legs, thinking she was a wild boar.

Steven Egan, 52, was hog hunting Saturday night with girlfriend Lisa Simmons when he left her behind at camp to pursue an animal.

Mr Egan said he then heard a noise in the woods and shot at it, thinking it was the hog. But instead he sent a .30 caliber rifle shot through both of Simmons' upper legs.

She had to be airlifted to a local hospital for surgery.
