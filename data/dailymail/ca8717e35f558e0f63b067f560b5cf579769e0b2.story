After reported lost for nearly 50 years, Pablo Picasso's masterpiece Seated Woman with Red Hat has been unearthed in the storage of an Indiana museum.

Described as sparkling 'like a jewel,' the long-lost piece was discovered after an auction house in New York inquired about the art work's gifting to the Evansville Museum in 1963.

At the time of its donation it was not believed to have been an actual work by Picasso, despite its signature, and so never saw the museum's walls.

'When the Evansville Museum received the gift, associated documentation indicated that the piece was created by an artist named “Gemmaux”,' the museum said in a release this week.

'Gemmaux,' the plural of 'gemmail,' they explained, is an artist's technique of layering glass while adding a clear liquid enamel across before firing it up.

This technique was rare for Picasso who only produced 50 or more during his study at a studio in France, the Evansville museum said.

Upon researching Picasso's previous gemmaux pieces earlier this year, auction house Guernsey's in New York inquired upon the museum's while seeing it labelled as such after its gift from international designer Raymond Loewy.

It was that inquisitive Guernsy's member who recognized the astonishing value in their Evansville museum’s masterpiece.

'It was undoubtedly a unique set of circumstances that uncovered this treasure within our museum,' said the museum's executive director John Streetman in a release.

He described it as 'extraordinary,' and said 'it sparkles like a jewel.'

The museum noted at the time that Picasso’s signature does appear on the artwork's top right-hand corner, placing its mention in its cataloguing.

Despite such a legendary find stashed right beneath their nose, the museum announced on Monday their plans, with heavy hearts, to take it to auction.

'Now that we have a full understanding of the requirements and additional expenses to display, secure, preserve and insure the piece, it is clear those additional costs would place a prohibitive financial burden on the museum,' said R Steven Krohn, president of the museum's board of trustees in a statement.

'It is in the best interest of the Evansville Museum to sell this work of art.'

Guernsey’s  will conduct a private selling of the art work with the auction house not releasing an estimation of its upcoming sale.

Still one of the world’s reigning top artists, Picasso's Garcon a la Pipe, painted when he was aged 24, is one of the most expensive works of art having been sold for $104 million (£58 million) in 2004.

In 2006 his Dora Maar au Chat sold for $95.2 million, the second-highest amount ever paid for a painting at auction, auction house Sotheby's said at the time.
