Revenge: After the capture of Abu Anas al-Liby, Libyan militants have threatened a backlash

Libyan militants have vowed to kidnap Westerners and attack gas pipelines in revenge for the capture of Al Qaeda terrorist Abu Anas al-Liby by U.S. special forces.

Extremists took to Facebook to urge fellow Libyans to target ships and planes as well as taking U.S. citizens hostage in order to exchange them for imprisoned jihadists.

Deborah Jones, the American ambassador to Libya, was yesterday summoned to speak to the country's justice minister to explain the U.S. government's actions.

Al-Liby was kidnapped on the streets of Tripoli by a team of Navy Seals on Saturday, and is now apparently being held on a ship in the Mediterranean Sea.

The 49-year-old, whose real name is Nazih al-Ruqaie, is suspected of involvement in the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998 which killed 224 civilians.

In the wake of his capture, Libyan jihadists used a Facebook page called 'Benghazi is Protected by its People' to issue a chilling call to arms.

It told Libyans to shut off access to the capital and kidnap citizens of the U.S. and its allies in order to use them to bargain for the release of imprisoned militants.

The message also urged them to damage pipelines exporting gas to Europe, and target ships and planes.

It said: 'Libya today is still a place of disbelief that is ruled by something other than the Shariah of Allah; thus, there is no security for disbelievers there.'

In another message posted on forums and social media, a group called 'the Revolutionaries of Benghazi - al-Bayda, Derna' condemned al-Liby's capture.

It accused Libya's leaders of having prior knowledge of the operation, although prime minister Ali Zeidan said at the weekend that the government had asked the United States to explain the raid.

The group vowed to fight 'everyone who betrayed his country and involved himself in this conspiracy. We say that this shameful act will cost the Libyan government a lot and it will be as you will see and not as you hear.'

Al-Liby has long been wanted by the FBI, and had a $5million bounty on his head at the time of his capture.

Since the fall of dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, Islamist militants have used Libya to smuggle out weapons and as a base for fighters.

In September last year, a band of terrorists stormed the U.S. consulate in Benghazi and killed ambassador Chris Stevens along with three other Americans.

North Africa is home to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, as well as other Islamist affiliates who either co-operate with the network or sympathise with its ideology.
