A wealthy businessman is fuming at Morrisons after he claims his brand new £75,000 BMW was crushed by the supermarket’s car wash.

David Elliott was inside his 6 Series Gran Coupe when the back window shattered just seconds after paying £6.99 for a wash and wax.

The 48-year-old quickly realised part of the supermarket’s car wash in Evesham, Worcestershire, had snagged on the lower edge of his BMW’s boot.

But instead of the safety mechanism cutting off the machine, the roller continued to rise - pushing the boot up into the back window.

Mr Elliot had just parked inside the car wash when he said he suddenly heard a loud 'splintering' sound

He quickly turned on the engine and drove out of the car wash to check the damage to his pride and joy - which he had bought only two months earlier.

He has since been quoted £4,000 to fix the damage but has been forced to put the BMW in a garage and cycle 16 miles to work while he waits for the car to get repaired.

Today the dad-of-two blasted the supermarket giant which he claims is refusing to accept liability.

This however, has been disputed by a Morrisons spokesperson, who said the company had not yet finished its investigation into the incident.

He said: 'I was typing away an email on my phone and heard a splintering sound and thought "that sounds expensive".

'I looked in the mirror and nothing happened and then I heard this crunching noise as the boot was somehow forced open and lifted up.

'Then as the car wash came over it, it thrust it forward through the back window. At this point I looked up and there was this almighty noise.

'I fired up the car and drove outside the car wash. Once I drove out, the remains of the window fell out. The boot was completely knackered too.

Mr Elliot said the car window smashed only seconds after he had paid the £6.99 for a wash and wax

The BMW - a 6 Series Gran Coupe - cost £75,000 and was only two months old when the incident occurred

'I called Morrisons customer services immediately telling them what had happened and within a week they had basically denied liability.

'They didn’t even send somebody to look at my car. The car wash was broken by the incident.

'But they got an engineer in who presumably just pushed the reset button and said the car wash was fine.

'Morrisons said to me they didn’t deny that the incident took place but because the car wash was fine beforehand and now the engineer said it’s working, it’s not their liability.

'They are completely washing their hands of it.'

Mr Elliot - who is the managing director of a fitness equipment company - spoke to the car wash manager immediately after the incident at 8.15am on July 30.

He then phoned Morrisons customer services who told him an engineer who they sent to check the car wash had reported no faults.

Mr Elliot, who lives with his wife Grizzie, 48, and two children Oskar, 15, and Georgina, 13, in Stow-on-the-Wold, Gloucestershire, added: 'It makes you think what would have happened if my kids were in the back of the car.

'A lot of kids put their faces against the back window to watch the roomers. All sorts of horrible things could have happened.

'They should have reported it to the health and safety executive and done a proper investigation.

'I want to take it to the small claims court but it is me against Morrisons’ legal team.

'When wanton destruction is wreaked upon your car, they should surely just pay up.

'I am waiting for the repair to be approved. The boot can’t shut and the back window isn’t present so I can’t drive at all.

'I have been quoted £4,000 but that could go up if they find the force has caused something else to be damaged once they remove the boot.

'I am cycling 25km to go to work every day. I had only had the car two months, it has only got 2,000 miles on the clock.

'This was my latest and greatest purchase. It was my pride and joy, the whole experience has been utterly horrific.'

A Morrisons spokesperson declined to comment other than to say its investigation had not been completed.
