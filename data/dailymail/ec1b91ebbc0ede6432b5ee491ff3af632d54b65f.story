A northeast Missouri man has been accused in a gruesome murder case in which he allegedly cut up his victim and threw the severed arms at witnesses who had gathered around.

Police were called to an apartment complex on Valley Forge Drive in Kirksville on a report of a car on fire in the parking lot.

When cops arrived, they found the vehicle consumed by flames, as well as two nearby apartments that were also on fire.

Armed and dangerous: Paul Potter of Kirksville was charged with murder after police said he tossed the arms of his dismembered victim at onlookers

Amid the commotion was 49-year-old Paul R. Potter of Kirksville, who could be seen hurling 'objects' at onlookers.

The 'objects' were found to be the arms of another man who was found stabbed to death inside one of the torched homes, according to the Kirksville Daily Express.

The victim was not identified, pending notification of next of kin.

Potter surrendered to officers and was arrested on charges of second-degree murder, arson and tampering with a motor vehicle.

Murder investigation: Kirksville is located about 120 miles from Jefferson City

He admitted to the murder, and said that he had set the fires to cover up the crime.

He was later booked into the Adair County Jail on $1million bond.

No information about the victim has been released. Online court records from Adair County did not list an attorney for Potter.

Kirksville police would not speak about 
the incident, referring calls to Adair County prosecutor Matt Wilson, 
who was not immediately available for comment.

Kirksville is located about 120 miles from Jefferson City.
