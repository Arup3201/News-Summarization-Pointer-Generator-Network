The whistles of derision that greet Cesc Fabregas's every touch at Barcelona are being noted at Manchester United and Arsenal. 

Barcelona coach Gerardo Martino and club directors have launched a staunch defence of the 26-year-old who has been targeted by fans throughout the season and more so in recent weeks following their team's Champions League exit followed and defeat to Real Madrid in the King's Cup.

Teammate Andres Iniesta said: 'Of course it hurts to see Cesc jeered. You try to ignore it and hope it does not happen, but these situations are not comfortable.'

On his way? Cesc Fabregas could find his time at the Nou Camp up soon, with some fans booing him on Sunday

Staunch defence: Coach Gerardo Martino has refused to criticise his midfielder this season

There would be no sense for Barcelona to sell Fabregas unless they have their transfer ban lifted but they will hold talks with him and his representatives to ascertain his state of mind and where they see changes over the coming weeks.

Barcelona's board will offer Lionel Messi an improved contract but have held meetings already to discuss who could leave with some key changes expected.

Wingers Pedro and Cristian Tello are also among players who could depart as is Alexis Sanchez.President Josep Bartomeu said: 'Some decisions have been made and there are others to be made. This is not the time to announce them because we are still playing in competition. There will be time for that in a few weeks.

'A lot of work has been done and it has all been good work. There won't be a revolution, but there will be in-depth restructuring of the football team.'

Are we going to see this again? The Gunners are on red alert if Fabregas is free to leave the Nou Camp

Dean Saunders' son attracting Premier League attention

Newcastle and Tottenham are among the clubs showing interest in Crewe's latest starlet Callum Saunders.

The 18-year-old striker is the son of former Liverpool and Wales international Dean Saunders and is showing his father's old traits in front of goal.

Saunders has scored more than 30 goals this season playing for Crewe's development sides and in the FA Youth Cup, where he notably scored twice against Coventry and Reading. Although coaches insist he still needs to get stronger, he is quick, bright and has an obvious instinct to push himself into the right areas.

Crewe have high hopes and have offered Saunders a three year professional contract and signing it will be a crucial decision if other clubs are serious in showing the same commitment to his development.

His father Dean is keen to play down Callum's prospects, when pressed on TV recently he would only say: 'He has a chance if he keeps working hard.'

Saunders Jr could yet opt to stay and follow the route of other Crewe youngsters safe in the knowledge scouts will always be present to see the latest starlet to roll off the Gresty Road conveyor belt.

Bilbao winger Iker Muniain too expensive

Interest gathering in Athletic Bilbao winger Iker Muniain could be tempered by a pending increase in his buy-out clause.

Despite the 21-year-old having only one year left on contract, his clause is set to move up to a whopping £40million on July 1, similar to that of teammate Ander Herrera.

Manchester City, United, Liverpool and Arsenal are all firm admirers of the boy from Pamplona but won't deal at that price. The notoriously stubborn Athletic board have rebuffed all talk of selling for reported bids of a cut-price £14million so the real work will be done by his representatives. Clubs are hoping to persuade him not to sign any new contract at Athletic and instead move as a free agent next summer.

The warning signs for the youngster though are that Fernando Llorente took a similar path but endured a troublesome time before his eventual departure to Juventus.

Too expensive? Iker Muniain could have his buy-out clause at Athletic Bilbao upped at the end of the season

Waiting game: Leeds United will not rush into offering a new deal to striker Ross McCormack

Ross McCormack won't be offered new Leeds contract soon

Leeds United will not rush into offering a new deal to striker Ross McCormack.

The 27-year-old has talked up his chances of getting improved terms despite having only signed a four year contract last summer.

The Scotland international is on 28 league goals going into today's game against Nottingham Forest and could become the first Leeds player since John Charles in 1957 to score 30 league goals in a season.

Talking after his latest goal earned the 1-0 win over Barnsley at the weekend, McCormack said: 'In terms of my future, I've got a couple of years left on my contract. It's up to the new owner if he wants to put a contract in front of me to sign, be part of this new regime and hopefully take the club forward.'If that's not the case, we'll look at other things.'

He added: 'It's good to be talked of in the same breath as John Charles. Hopefully I can nick another two between now and the end of the season. Personally, it's been a great season. It's just unfortunate that collectively we've not been good enough and the table does not lie.'

Despite failed bids by West Ham and Cardiff in January, Leeds' only other offer for McCormack has come from Middlesbrough and that was last summer. West Ham remain in the market for a striker, however, McCormack may find surprise options in Italy. New owner Massimo Cellino who is in the throes of selling his other club Cagliari said: 'Ross McCormack is a real striker and I'd love to see him in Italy.'

Surprise in store? Massimo Cellino said he would like to see McCormack ply his trade over in Italy

Matty Taylor a wanted Hammer

West Ham's Matty Taylor is figuring on a few shortlists ahead of the summer.

The 32-year-old has been left out of the starting line-up in recent weeks and is a free agent at the end of the season when his contract runs out.

His Premier League experience and versatility are making him an option for sides looking to bolster their squad with British players. Taylor has figured at left-back, left midfield and centre midfield.

On the move? Matty Taylor is wanted by a selection of clubs when the season finishes next month

Goncalo Guedes wanted by Arsenal

Arsenal are continuing to track Benfica midfielder Goncalo Guedes. The 17-year-old winger has impressed in the UEFA Youth League this season scoring four goals in nine games including one in the 2-1 win over Manchester City in March. Borussia Dortmund and Manchester United have also shown an interest but Benfica are pushing for the player to sign a new contract so they can hike up his value.

Arsenal are also continuing to watch Southampton's Callum Slattery but the 16-year-old is keen to stay and develop at the South Coast club.
