The average British father has two children, drives a Ford, earns Â£29,000 a year and is sat in front of the television watching the news by 7.47pm each night.

These are the results of a new study of the nation's fathers which seems to suggest we really are a nation of 'Mondeo Men'.

Researchers who quizzed 1,200 men found the average father spends most of his time either watching TV or ferrying his children around.

Mondeo Man: Britain's average father usually drives a Ford and spends a lot of his time ferrying children around

He works a nine hour day, from 8am to 5pm and normally drinks three pints a week.

The study, carried out for the launch 
of the American Dad DVD, found fathers will spend two hours and 55 
minutes watching TV each day with the news the most popular programme 
choice.

But they also watch around four hours of live sport or highlights.

Half of all fathers even admitted to being a regular viewer of a soap such as EastEnders and Coronation Street.

During the summer holidays he will spending most of his time acting as a 'taxi' - the study found fathers drive an average of 46 miles a week giving their offspring lifts.

But it seems fathers make sure to get their own back. The study found they will manage to embarrass their children by coming out with inappropriate comments ten times a month and will hear the phrase 'you're so embarrassing' once a week.

And being out in public isn't any easier for children.

Awkward comments were found to be a father's most popular way of embarrassing their children, followed by 'when
I was your age' stories and telling tales from their child's early 
years.

Kissing and cuddling their youngsters 
in public, as well as the dreaded moment they lick a finger or napkin to
wipe dirt off your face were also on the list.

'Dad-dancing', telling children off 
in front of their friends and grilling their son or daughter's potential
love interest also made the top ten embarrassing things fathers do.

A spokesman for the American Dad DVD said: 'From 
the results in the survey, British dads are not far removed from the 
stereotypical image they have - spending their evenings in front of the 
telly and knocking back a few beers after work.

'Everyone thinks they are alone in having an embarrassing and awkward dad, but it seems that actually, the opposite is true.'
