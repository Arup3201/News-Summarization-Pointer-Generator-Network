He may be trying to encourage more people to enter the digital world, but Prince Andrew was less than impressed when pop star Will.i.am's mobile phone went off next to him in an interview.

The royal reminded the Black Eyed Peas frontman and reality show judge him to turn devices off before important engagements - such as their joint appearance on TV.

The two are partnering to promote an award designed to teach computer skills to inner city children.

Not impressed: Prince Andrew looked sternly towards Will.i.am's leg when his phone went off in a TV interview

'Leave it in the car!': The royal explained that he makes sure his phone is nowhere near to avoid such gaffes

After the excitable popstar was left fumbling for his mobile in an interview broadcast this morning, the prince revealed that he leaves his phone in the car when appearing on television - advising Will.i.am to do the same.

He said: 'I leave my digital devices in the car when I am doing engagements - based on the fact that they might accidentally go off. 

Andrew had just made a point about elitism in education, when the singer was left apologising for the high-pitched ringtone coming from his pocket.

Will.i.am was given the opportunity to reveal who the call was from, but sheepishly turned off the device and said he would check later.

Prince Andrew initially laughed along and kept his thought to himself, but was later asked whether he was as digitally-aware as his fellow interviewee, at which point he decided to offer some advice. 

The awkward moment came in an interview with Susannah Reid on ITV's Good Morning Britain.

The two appeared on the programme to promote the Inspiring Digital Enterprise Award, which aims to make young people more employable.

Explaining the origins of the project, Will.i.am said: ‘I got invited to Buckingham Palace and Prince Andrew was there and I was so over the moon and just full of excitement and I was telling him, young kids in inner cities, we need to find opportunities for them, get them up to speed.

‘I didn’t think that conversation would follow up with let’s partner up and do something providing opportunities for kids to brings ideas to culture’. 

Prince Andrew said: ‘If we don’t give young people the skills to be able to work in this environment, they are going to feel even more ostracised than they may or may not do today.’

After the interview the Prince also revealed that he is a fan of the Black Eye Peas singer's music, but refused to appear in a selfie alongside Miss Reid and Will.i.am, instead asking that the photographs be taken from a distance.
