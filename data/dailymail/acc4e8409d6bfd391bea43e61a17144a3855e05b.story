Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said Thursday that he and President Barack Obama had 'no major differences' and there was no single reason for his resignation.

Hagel said he simply came to the conclusion that it was the right time for him to step aside, and he leaves believing that he accomplished a great deal. 

The outgoing Pentagon chief's comments marked the first time he has responded to questions about his resignation since he submitted it Nov. 24. 

They come on the eve of Obama's plans to announce Hagel's successor and a day after a senior U.S. Army officer told MailOnline Hagel was 'relieved' to not have to shill for Obama anymore.

Watch your back: Outgoing Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel wouldn't give a specific reason for his resignation today, again saying that it was a 'mutual decision' between he and President Barack Obama and they had 'no major differences'

Asked directly whether he felt he was pressured to resign today, Hagel was not specific. He called it a 'mutual decision' with Obama based on one-on-one talks at the White House. 

Hagel said he and Obama had discussed the coming two years, the last of Obama's term, and saw what Hagel called 'another zone' of challenges ahead for the country.

'Leaders have to be wise enough to know that,' he said.

'We both came to the conclusion,' he said, referring to his private consultations with Obama, 'that I think the country was best served with new leadership. He thought it was (also), over at this institution after we had talked through it.'

The Department of Defense insider who spoke with MailOnline on Wednesday said Hagel 'jumped at the chance to get out, and couldn't wait to announce it so things didn't go more to hell in Iraq and he’d get blamed for it.’ 

‘No one wants to be disloyal,' he said. 'But also nobody wants to be on watch while the Defense Department weakens to the point of disintegrating, and America gets pushed around the [global] schoolyard. It’s embarrassing.’

Another Hagel confidante told CNN on Wednesday that the Pentagon head 'wanted to move quickly' toward the exit. 

Juxtaposed with the international turmoil that's arisen since he vacated his Senate seat to join the Obama administration less than two years ago, CNN's source said Hagel want to 'at least control his departure.'

Arizona Sen. John McCain said in a radio interview last month that Hagel was 'very, very frustrated' by the time he put in his notice.

When Obama announced that Hagel was leaving, he called the former Republican senator from Nebraska an 'exemplary' Pentagon chief and indicated that resigning was Hagel's decision. 

He said Hagel approached him and 'determined that ... it was an appropriate time for him to complete his service.'

'Let me just say that Chuck is and has been a great friend of mine. I've known him, admired him and trusted him for nearly a decade since I was a green-behind-the- ears freshman senator and we were both on the Senate Foreign Relations committee,' Obama told reporters gathered in the White House State Dining Room. 

It was at a press briefing later that day that the White House said Hagel's departure came after he and Hagel came to the decision jointly.

'The two of them arrived together at the determination that new leadership should take over at the Pentagon,' Earnest told reporters.

Rumors immediately began swirling that Hagel was asked to leave, however.

A senior Pentagon official told NBC News that Hagel 'wasn’t up to the job.'

While denying that Hagel was forced out, the White House acknowledged last month that the issues plaguing the Pentagon require a different type of leadership skills than the ones Hagel was brought on to handle.

'When Secretary Hagel was first nominated for this job.....the threat that was posed by ISIL was not nearly as significant as it is now,' Earnest told reporters. 

The White House says it will announce Hagel's replacement on Friday. 

Obama is widely to expected to name former Deputy Defense Secretary Ashton Carter as Hagel's successor.

The White House wouldn't confirm to reporters this week that Carter was Obama's pick, but Earnest lavished praised on him when probed by reporters for his thoughts of the former DOD official.

Earnest said Carter 'certainly deserves and has demonstrated strong bipartisan support for his previous service in government,' but insisted, 'I don't have any additional insight to share with you.' 

Carter left the Obama administration in 2013. Unlike Hagel, he has never served in the active military, but he is respected by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.

He served as the No. 2 official at the Pentagon from October 2011 to December 2013. He also used to be the Pentagon's chief arms buyer.

He has been mum since rumors began swirling that he would be the next Defense Secretary.
