Following his Man of the Match performance against West Ham on Boxing Day, Chelsea winger Eden Hazard enjoyed some festive family time.

The 23-year-old took to Instagram to share a snap of himself and his three brothers, Kylian, Thorgan and Ethan as the siblings took part in a game of Monopoly.

As far as footballing families go, the Hazard household is one to be envied.

Borussia Monchengladbach star Thorgan Hazard was over from Germany to visit his big brother as the Bundesliga takes a break over the Christmas period. 

Kylian Hazard, 19, also plays professionally for Belgian Pro League side Zulte Waregem and Ethan, the youngest of the four brothers, plays at youth level and is tipped to follow suit in professional football. 

The buck doesn't stop there as father Thierry and mother Carine are also both former semi-pros. 

But it is oldest sibling Eden, expected to sign a new five-year contract with the Blues in January, who has been stealing the headlines as he continues his brilliant form scoring nine goals in all competitions so far for his club.

The Belgian helped Jose Mourinho's side to an easy 2-0 win against the Hammers, during which John Terry scored his second goal in as many games to give Chelsea a first half lead before Diego Costa notched his 13th premier League goal of the season.

Speaking after the game, the Chelsea captain said: 'We're playing great now, everyone can see that, and if we continue to do that it's going to be tough.

'That's (the title) the target for us, right from day one.

'We've got off to a good start, and if we continue our form it's going to be tough for anyone.

'I see a hunger among the players that haven't won the league.'ha
