Train travel is Britain's most romantic form of transport... with one in 10 people admitting falling in love while riding the railway.

More than a third of rail travellers said they believe rail travel is synonymous with romance

And a further 20 per cent say they met someone who became a friend while on a train journey, according to a new survey.

Kissing on the platform: Conversations with complete strangers can lead to something more permanent

The real-life Brief Encounters often mean that chance meetings and conversations with complete strangers in railway carriages often lead to something more permanent.

The study is to mark, I Love Trains Week, an initiative by East Coast Trains, launched by TV presenter and actress Donna Air who agreed with the findings.

Donna said: 'I think there is something very romantic about a train journey - it's the perfect opportunity to share some time with a loved one. 

'There's a real sense of adventure, somehow you're in your own little bubble, and conversations and feelings become more memorable and intimate as you speed through the lovely British countryside. I love trains. They've been a huge part of my life.'

Donna, star of Byker Grove, MTV and The Big Breakfast, has even changed her Twitter profile name to 'Donna Train' to launch the week. 

Getting cosy on the train: Two young passengers can't keep their hands off each other

As well as being the most romantic, train travel is also considered to be the most sociable form of transport, with 40 per cent of those questioned saying they would choose to chat to a fellow train passenger verses 15 per cent on an airplane and 11 per cent on a bus. 

Only 3 per cent of those surveyed said they would chat to another passenger while on the tube.

Rail journeys also seem to bring out the best in people with more than a third (37 per cent) of those surveyed saying that they'd experienced a random act of kindness from a complete stranger while on a train. It was also the top travel choice for British families.

The I Love Trains Week campaign, aims to re-connect people with the unique British enjoyment that comes from train travel and the memories it evokes.

Train travellers and rail fans are also being encouraged to get involved by sharing their own reasons why they love trains via East Coast's Twitter feed @eastcoastuk using the hashtag #ilovetrainsweek - with prizes to be won for the best stories and photos.

East Coast Managing Director Karen Boswell said: 'I Love Trains Week, celebrates the nostalgia and romance of trains and train travel. 

Sealed with a kiss: Train travel is also considered to be the most romantic form of transport

'Whether it's visiting grandparents for the weekend, or the couple who first met on the 08.25 from Newcastle, train travel offers more than a journey from A to B. 

'Our customers make 20 million journeys with us every year, and as well as helping them get to where they need to be, nothing makes us happier than helping people get together to capture special moments with a loved one to create the best of memories.

East Coast Trains run fast and frequent services between London's Kings Cross, the Midlands, Yorkshire, the North East and Scotland and will be holding special events at London's Kings Cross Station and the National Railway Museum in York; along with at Edinburgh, Leeds and Newcastle railway stations.
