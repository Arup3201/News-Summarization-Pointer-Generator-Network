Job to do: Luiz Felipe Scolari's Brazil will have to try and make the final without Neymar

Team news: Luiz Felipe Scolari has several options to replace injured star man Neymar.

Paulinho or Fernandinho could be asked to play a more advanced role now that regular midfielder Luis Gustavo is back from suspension.

But the two biggest contenders to fill Neymar's position are Chelsea forward Willian or Shakhtar Donetsk's Bernard.

Neither player has started a match for Brazil during the World Cup, but Willian has come off the bench in all but one of the team's matches.

Bernard, a tricky, diminutive 21-year-old, has made two substitute appearances during the tournament.

Brazil captain Thiago Silva will also miss out due to suspention and will be replaced by Dante with David Luiz taking the captain's armband.

Germany coach Joachim Low has no such selection problems with only Shkodran Mustafi unavailable, yet he still does not seem to have found his first-choice starting XI.

Philipp Lahm moved back to right-back in the quarter-final against France with Miroslav Klose making his first start up front, where Thomas Muller had previously been first choice.

Mesut Ozil has struggled to deliver while Lukas Podolski no longer seems to figure in Low's plans.

Key clash: Oscar (Brazil) v Bastian Schweinsteiger (Germany)

With Neymar injured Oscar will revert to his preferred No 10 role and he will be looking to constantly put pressure on Schweinsteiger who, despite being one of the world’s best midfielders, will have his questionable fitness tested by the Brazilian.

Key battle: Oscar will go up against Germany's Bastian Schweinsteiger in midfield

One to watch: Marcelo (Brazil)

The Real Madrid left-back has enjoyed a good tournament for the Selecao, but that could come to a crashing halt against Philipp Lahm. Germany's Mr Versatile, Lahm has been deployed as a holding midfielder and at right-back during the tournament, though Joachim Low is expected to opt for the latter in a bid to stop Marcelo's rampaging runs down that side.

Head-to-head record: Played 21 Brazil Wins 12 Draws 5 Germany Wins 4

End the hurt: Germany have not won a World Cup since 1990
