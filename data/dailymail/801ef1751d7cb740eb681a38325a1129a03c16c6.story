Washington has been scrambling to tamp down a controversy over suspended death benefits for the families of fallen military soldiers, and the White House has announced that a charity would pick up the costs of the payments during the government shutdown.

`The Fisher House Foundation will provide the families of the fallen with the benefits they so richly deserve,` Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a statement, adding that the Pentagon would reimburse the foundation after the shutdown ended.

Hagel said Fisher House, which works with veterans and their families, had approached the Pentagon about making the payments. The Defense Department typically pays families about $100,000 within three days of a soldier's death, but officials say the shutdown was preventing those benefits from being paid.

A senior defense official said the government could not actively solicit funds from private organizations, but could accept an offer. Scroll down for video

Sad sight: Pfc. Cody Patterson's body was brought back to the United States after being killed in Afghanistan on October 6. His funeral expenses are now being paid by a charity because of the shutdown

Respect: The Pentagon has now agreed to pay the charity back after the shutdown is lifted and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel was at Dover Air Force Base when Patterson's body arrived

The failure to make the payments has stirred outrage both on Capitol Hill and at the White House. Obama spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday that the president was `disturbed` when he found out the death benefits had been suspended and demanded an immediate solution.

`The commander in chief, when he found out that this was not addressed, he directed that a solution be found, and we expect one today,` Carney said before the Pentagon announced the agreement with Fisher House.

The House unanimously passed legislation Wednesday to restore the death benefits but it's unclear whether the Democratic-led Senate will take up the measure or whether Obama would sign it.

Obama has threatened to veto other legislation passed by the House in recent days that would reopen individual funding steams, arguing that a piecemeal approach was unacceptable and the entire government must be reopened.

The fix has not satisfied all of the 
soldiers relatives, and one father cannot believe that members of 
Congress are still getting paid during the shutdown.

'If
Congress were trapped in a car that sunk down in a river, I would swim 
to the window, and I would look them all in the eye and say, "Suck 
water,"' said Randall Peterson, the father of 24-year-old PFC Cody 
Peterson who was killed in the field.

The names of the five soldiers who were killed have been released-Sgt Patrick Hawkins, Special Agent Joseph Peters, Patterson, Marine LCPL Jeremiah Collins Jr, Lt Jennifer Moreno- and Fox News reports that they are all under the age of 25 years old.

'After losing a loved one in service 
to our nation, these families should not have to endure more pain as the
result of political squabbling,' said Ken Fisher, the head of the 
military-focused charity that stepped up.

Mr Patterson was not the only grieving family member to speak out, and a number of others have come forward.

‘The
government is hurting the wrong people,’ Shannon Collins, who lost her 
son, Marine Lance Corporal Jeremiah M. Collins Jr., over the weekend in 
Afghanistan told NBC News.

‘Families shouldn’t have to worry about how they’re going to bury their child,’ she added.

‘Families shouldn’t have to worry about how they're going to feed their family if they don’t go to work this week.’

Sgt Hawkins was on his fourth deployment to Afghanistan, he died rushing to the aid of another dying soldier.

‘Sgt.
Patrick Hawkins was a brave and incredibly talented Ranger,’ Lt. Col., 
Patrick J. Ellis, the commander of the 3rd battalion, told NBC News. 
‘His actions that night were in keeping with the epitome of the Ranger 
Creed: ‘I will never leave a fallen comrade.’

First Lt. Moreno was a nurse assigned to the cultural support team, it was her first combat deployment.

‘Our unit mourns the loss of 1st Lt. Jennifer Moreno,’ Lt Col. Ellis told NBC News.

Lance Cpl Collins was out of high school for just over a year when he died in what NBC News termed ‘murky circumstances.’

Denied
what they rightfully deserve, the families of these heroes should soon 
receive their benefits, according to Speaker Boehner.

‘Tomorrow,
the House is going to act specifically on this and I hope the president
will sign it,’ he said during a Tuesday press conference.

Determined: Republican Speaker of the House John Boehner has tried to submit a bill approving the payment of 'death benefits' to military families but Democrats don't want to take a piecemeal approach to the budget approval process

The
payment of the so-called 'death benefits' has become a political issue 
on its own as Republican Speaker John Boehner has blasted Democrats for 
failing to support his bill to fund the payouts before the budget is 
approved fully.

'I think it's disgraceful that they're withholding these benefits,' he said.

The
seemingly obvious move to pay the benefits is steeped in political 
motivations, however, as Boehner and the Republicans have repeatedly 
tried to push through smaller single-issue funding appropriations 
without agreeing to end the shutdown by approving an entire budget.

President
Obama was reportedly 'disturbed' to find out that it would take longer 
than the standard three days to get the 'benefits' to the relatives and 
press secretary Jay Carney said that a solution would be found 
Wednesday.

'It is 
upsetting because my husband died for his country, and now his family is
left to worry,' Ashley Peters, the wife of Joseph Peters, told NBC.

'My husband always said if something happened to him we would be taken care of. 

'I'm a stay-at-home mom, which is what my husband wanted. He wanted me to take care of our son.'

The five soldiers whose funeral payments are being fought over are far from the only ones who face financial letdown.

Continued rhetoric: President Obama gave a press conference on Tuesday saying that he would not negotiate under threat but Republicans want certain services funded before approving the entire budget

About
3.8 million veterans will not receive disability compensation next 
month if the partial government shutdown continues into late October, 
Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki says.

Some 315,000 veterans and 202,000 surviving spouses and dependents will see pension payments stopped.

Shinseki
is spelling out some of the dire consequences of a longer-term shutdown
in testimony Wednesday for the House Committee on Veterans Affairs.

The
short-term consequences have meant that disability claims production 
has slowed by an average of about 1,400 per day since the shutdown began
October 1, and that has stalled the department's efforts to reduce the 
backlog of disability claims pending for longer than 125 days.

In all, more than $6 billion in payments would be halted with an extended shutdown.

'In some areas, like health care delivery, there are fewer adverse effects. In others, such as reducing the claims backlog, we have already seen a negative impact,' Shinseki says in written testimony obtained by The Associated Press in advance of the hearing.

The House has passed legislation that would provide veterans disability, pension and other benefits in the event of a prolonged shutdown, but the White House has pushed against the piecemeal approach.

Shinseki plans to make that case as well, saying it's not the best solution for veterans. He'll note that even if the VA were fully funded, some services to veterans would suffer.
