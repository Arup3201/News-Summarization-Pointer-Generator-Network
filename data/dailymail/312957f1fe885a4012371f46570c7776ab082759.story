Katie Hopkins earns her living off her acid tongue - hundreds of thousands of hapless Brits have been hung out to dry for their choice in children's names of size of waistband since she shot to fame on The Apprentice. 

But for the first time ever, the social commentator was unusually caring and compassionate as she appeared on This Morning alongside Christina Briggs - the 25-stone mother who has called on the government to pay her to lose weight. 

The pair sat arm-in-arm on the ITV programme's sofa with presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden, with Katie even proclaiming Twitter war on people who have attacked Christina on the internet since her comments were first published.

Katie admitted that her new weight gain - almost four stone in three months - has made her much more sympathetic to large people. 

She said: 'I understand, I only put on half my body weight, but I understand about this thing of getting to the front door and people calling you names. 

'It hasn't changed my view, I stand by everything I said - I still wouldn't employ a fat person. 

'Looking at myself after a few months (putting on weight), I wouldn't employ me either as it's hard on your knees, on your health, even hard to breathe.

Mother-of-two Christina complained that junk food is much cheaper than healthy food

'But I also see the abuse and aggression directed on Twitter for (Christina), I also see someone with this body mass where it must be hard to deal with all of that weight. 

'I can see that I learned some big things when I put on weight, that it's hard.' 

Christina, 26, from Wigan hit the headlines this week after she complained that she needed more taxpayers' money than her £15,000-a-year benefits in order to overhaul her unhealthy lifestyle. 

The mother-of-two believes that she can't lose weight because she can only afford junk food and doesn't have the funds to pay for a gym. 

Speaking on This Morning for the first time since she prompted a nationwide backlash for her comments in this week's Closer magazine, Christina said she could understand why people were so annoyed with her demands. 

She said: 'I understand the outrage, I do get benefits paid for me but I have a daughter with ADHD and I help a lot as a carer for my brother as well.

'The only thing I can control is what I eat because comfort food is better than going out and letting people bully me.'

'I go to the door and get ready for a run, but then I just turn back and go inside - I think that if I go for a run down the street, people will laugh at me. 

'I don't want (weight-loss) surgery, I want to prove to my kids that I can do it myself, the price of gym should be lowered.' 

Whereas in the past, Katie would have argued against these comments, the mother-of-three was surprisingly understanding of Christina's reluctance to exercise. 

The new issue of Closer with Christina's interview is out now 

She said: 'I used to say, for goodness sake, put trainers on and go for a run. 

'But there is a large population of obese people who are invisible because they don't want to go out.

'Sometimes you get to a point where you go to a doctor and they say your BMI is too high for help.

'Fat clubs, I call them that, but they would call themselves Slimming World or Weightwatchers, would also be less inclined to help because you're too large and it is too expensive to join those anyway.

'So the people who are joining me in my project to lose weight, we're trying to set up a way on Twitter of finding a way that works for us.

'So for example, (Christina) really loves swimming, so if she could find someone to buddy with then she'd feel safer because there are people there in case someone calls you names. 

'Weight is much more of a mental issue than in your body.' 

The TV star also had a parting shot for all of the keyboard warriors who have been targeting Christina with hurtful comments over the web in the past 24 hours. 

She said: 'If you go on her, you take me on too.'
