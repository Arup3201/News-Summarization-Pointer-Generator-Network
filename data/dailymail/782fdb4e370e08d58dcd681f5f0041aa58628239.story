A Labor MP has demanded Prime Minister Tony Abbott provides evidence that he is no longer a British citizen.

Terri Butler, MP for Griffith in Queensland, questioned the PM over whether he is still a dual citizen after being contacted ‘on numerous occasions on social media’ by blogger Tony Magrathea, from the Sunshine Coast. 

Mr Abbott was born in London, England, in 1957 to an Australian mother and English father and came to Australia in 1960 as an assisted migrant. He applied for Australian citizenship in 1981, becoming a dual citizen of Australia and Britain, and then reportedly – on an undisclosed date – renounced his British citizenship. 

If Mr Abbott is still a British citizen he would not be eligible to be Prime Minister.

Labor MP Terri Butler has written a letter to Prime Minister Tony Abbott asking him about his citizenship

The PM was born in London, England, in 1957 to an Australian mother and English father

Mr Magrathea is said to have emailed politicians across the country asking them if they were purposely staying quiet about the PM allegedly being a dual citizen, Independent Australia reports.

The blogger previously reportedly submitted a Freedom of Information request to the Prime Minister's office and the British Home Office seeking a copy of Mr Abbott’s RN form.

The form is used by British subjects to renounce their citizenship.

As part of the Australian constitution, people who hold dual citizenship are not permitted to stand for election to Federal Parliament.

In his email to MPs, Mr Magrathea wrote: ‘The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet declared in an FOI request, 2014-159, in October last year, that Mr Abbott is still a dual citizen of Britain and Australia.’

Ms Butler is thought to be the only MP who responded to Mr Magrathea’s email. She promised to write to Mr Abbott and ask him to provide the requested RN form as evidence. 

Ms Butler sent the letter on Friday and asked him to provide Mr Magarathea 'with a copy of the declaration of renunciation' that he received when he renounced his British citizenship

In her letter to the Mr Abbott on Friday, Ms Butler wrote:

'I have received an email from a Mr Tony Magarthea who asserts that you have yet to renounce your British citizenship, I enclose my response to Mr Magrathea.

'I make no claim that you are ineligible to sit in the House of Representatives, that your election was void, or that you have failed to renounce your British citizenship. I have seen no evidence that would satisfy me of any such claim(s).

'However, I also have no desire to continue to receive, and respond to, communications questioning your eligibility under section 44(i) of the Constitution.

'For that reason, I believe it would assist if you would provide Mr Magrathea with a copy of the declaration of renunciation that you received after renouncing your citizenship. Alternatively, it would assist if you would advise the date of your renunciation.

‘Thank you, in advance, for considering this letter.'

However, a spokesperson for Ms Butler told Daily Mail Australia the MP believes ‘it’s a non-issue’. 

He confirmed Ms Butler has not received a response yet, but highlighted the letter was ‘only posted on Friday.’

‘Terri’s got no view on Tony’s citizenship,’ the spokesperson said.

‘He’d [Tony Magrathea] contacted her on numerous occasions on social media and she was just making sure the guy got some sort of reply,’ he explained.

‘Terri believes the battleground with the LNP is on policy and ideology not on citizenship, she’d be highly surprised if he wasn’t a citizen in the 2013 election… she won’t be taking any further action.

‘She was just making sure this guy got a reply from a parliamentary representative, she doesn’t think it is an issue or ever was an issue.

Mr Abbott (centre) applied for Australian citizenship in 1981, becoming a dual citizen of Australia and Britain, and studied at Oxford University in England 

The PM's office previously denied that Mr Abbott (right, next to British Prime Minister David Cameron) is still a dual citizen 

‘She stated clearly in her letter we should be concerned on policies and ideologues,’ the spokesperson added.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted the Prime Minister’s Office for comment.

Meanwhile, a Change.org petition demanding 'Show the public your British Citizenship renunciation form' currently has over 25,000 signatures.

The petition reads: 'Section 44 of the Australian Constitution forbids anyone holding dual citizenship from being elected to Parliament. Tony Abbott's refusal (under FOI request) to provide his Form RN renouncing his British citizenship before being elected (26 March 1994), raises serious questions about his legality as a Member of Parliament.'

On September 18 2014, Jan Olson requested to see Mr Abbott's official confirmation of renunciation of British citizenship under the Freedom of Information Act.

MP Terri Butler has explained that she just wants to help Mr Abbott 'put the issue to bed'

Her request was denied by Robert McMahon, the Assistant Secretary of the Parliamentary and Government Branch, because 'no documents relevant to the request are in the possession of the Department'.

The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet said 'no relevant documents were found' when they searched for them.

Also in September, NineMsn were told by the Prime Minister's Office and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet  that Mr Abbott has renounced his British Citizenship.

'The Prime Minister is an Australian citizen and does not hold citizenship of any other country,' the Department reportedly said.
