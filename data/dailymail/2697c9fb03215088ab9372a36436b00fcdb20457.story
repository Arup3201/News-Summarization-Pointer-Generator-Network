Steve Williams, chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales says most see striking as a last resort

More than 45,000 rank and file police officers have demanded the right to go on strike.

In a ballot, one in three members of the Police Federation voted to claim the same industrial rights as other public sector workers.

Currently, police officers are banned by law from taking industrial action.

But some – furious at Home Office cuts to pay, pensions and overtime – want to be able to walk out in the same way as teachers, nurses and Tube workers.

Of those who voted, 80 per cent were in favour of the Federation campaigning for striking rights. Around 56,333 voted, of whom 45,651 voted in favour.  Some 10,681 were opposed.

But because fewer than half the Federation’s 130,000 members took part in the vote, it is not binding on the staff association’s leaders.

This has led to further controversy. Members of the Metropolitan branch, representing officers in London, said it was ‘appalled’ by the 50 per cent rule.

They claimed this meant a clear mandate from members was ‘simply being ignored’.

A spokesman said: ‘The Police Federation of England and Wales decided to impose an unachievable threshold of 50 per cent plus one of the entire membership to achieve a result. PFEW has no rules that  justify this decision.

Lost: A ballot of police officers held on the right to take industrial action has failed to reach a high enough majority, even though thousands voted in favour

‘In effect, it ruled that officers who
 chose to abstain would be deemed to have voted “no”.’ The Federation 
represents more than 130,000 officers from the rank of constable to 
chief inspector.

Pleased: Home Office minister Damian Green welcomed news that the Police Federation failed in its attempt to overturn a ban on strikes

Officers are banned from forming trade unions and taking strike action under the Police Act 1919.

The Federation has loudly opposed cuts
 to police funding of around one fifth, and members marched on Whitehall
 to show their fury at changes to police pay and perks.

Steve Williams, chairman of the PFEW, 
said: ‘Our members value their unique employment status as servants of 
the Crown and I believe the vast majority of them would view industrial 
action as a last resort.’

Police Minister Damian Green said: ‘I 
am pleased the vast majority of police officers do not want the  right 
to strike. Their work is too important.’

Earlier this year the Home Office 
announced starting salaries for officers with no experience would be cut
 by nearly a fifth to  £19,000 a year – less than a trainee manager at 
McDonald’s.

Home Secretary Theresa May is yet to 
decide whether to accept a recommendation from Tom Winsor – the former 
rail regulator commissioned by the Government to  examine police pay and
 conditions – to allow chiefs to sack under- performing officers.

45,651 wanted to strike and 10,681 were against - not enough to change law
