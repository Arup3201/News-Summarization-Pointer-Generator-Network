More than a hundred people missed their flights this morning after being evacuated from a Stansted Express train when it collided with an overhead cable.

Police and paramedics helped passengers off the Greater Anglia train just before 5am after its front window was smashed close to Northumberland Park Station on the London to Cambridge route.

No one was injured, the London Ambulance service confirmed.

A British Rail worker at the scene told how just two days ago the fire brigade attended the station when the same overhead cables became loose and started arcing.

A spokesperson for Network Rail said: 'We
have engineers on site working to repair the damage as quickly as 
possible and are investigating the causes.

'Passengers should check with 
National Rail Enquiries for the latest information before travelling.'

The drama was caught on camera passengers who were helped off the train. James Marks said 'it was really tough on a mum and daughter who lost a hard earned holiday! I was a lucky one.'

Services are operating at 'normal 
frequency' between Cambridge and London, but are diverting via Seven 
Sisters, said the train operator, Greater Anglia, which has been inundated with complaints from customers on Twitter.

Â A spokesman for the company, which 
runs the Stansted Express running between Cambridge and London Liverpool
Street, said services were disrupted because of 'overhead wire damage'.

National Rail apologise for the disruption on Twitter

He said: 'Owing to overhead wire problems between Tottenham Hale and Waltham Cross, some lines are blocked.

'Train services running from London Liverpool Street through these stations are currently suspended, and are being diverted via Seven Sisters.'

He added they apologise for the delays, which are likely to 'last throughout most of today'.
