Hundreds of supporters flocked to the streets of Edinburgh to mark the passing of Dave Mackay, with  Sir Alex Ferguson leading the tributes.

The former Manchester United manager labelled the ex-Hearts and Tottenham enforcer as 'humble', adding that 'he was the bravest man in the world'.  

Mackay, who was laid to rest in Edinburgh on Tuesday, died earlier this month at the age of 80 and - according to Ferguson - ought to have earned far more caps for Scotland than he did.

Denis Law, Frank McLintock, Ian St John, Alan Mullery and Bertie Auld also attended his funeral in the Scottish capital, with the cortege leaving from his beloved Tynecastle for a remembrance service in the city.

Mackay won all three Scottish domestic honours with Hearts in the 1950s and was a key part of Spurs' famous 1961 double-winning team.

He was named Footballer of the Year in both Scotland and England, and also starred for Derby County, where he won the First Division title as manager.

'He was a fantastic player,' Ferguson said. 'They talk about this great courage he had and I think that is unfair. I know he was the bravest man in the world but he was a fantastic footballer, he was skilful.

'His personality, his intensity, his desire to win could make any team. And he proved that by going to Derby County and winning the league as a centre-back. He could play anywhere.

'I thought it was a nice piece in the papers about how he said he didn't enjoy seeing that photograph of him and Billy Bremner portraying him as a bully. He said "I don't like bullies".

'I think that was exactly what Dave Mackay was like. He was a humble person. Humility is embraced by great people and I think Dave Mackay embraced that thoroughly.

'He protected his modesty with the pride only a Scotsman can do.

'His record's fantastic. It's a privilege to speak here today and I think we have seen the passing of a truly great legend.' 

Mackay won 22 caps for Scotland and began his career with Hearts in 1953.

That is something to rankle with Ferguson. 

'Scotland was picked by a committee with their heads in the sand. The fact he has only 22 caps tells you [that],' he added.

'Twenty-two caps for a player as good as that. I could never understand that.'

He captained Hearts to the Scottish League title during the 1957-58 season and joined Spurs in 1959, helping the north London club become the first English side to win the league and FA Cup double during the 1960-61 season.

He joined Derby in 1968 and helped Brian Clough's side win promotion to the First Division the following year before taking up a player-manager role at Swindon Town in 1971.

A year later Mackay left to manage Nottingham Forest for a brief spell before succeeding Clough as Derby manager in 1973, with the Rams winning the First Division title in 1975.

Ferguson recalled the only time he played against Mackay.

'I was playing for Queen's Park reserves against Hearts reserves at Tynecastle and the great Mackay was playing because he was coming back from a broken toe.

'He tackled me and I thought "Christ", but in those days you had to get up no matter what. So I got up, had a look at that big barrel chest of his and he just said "are you all right, son?".

'That was a great memory - the only time I played against Dave Mackay - and I'll never forget it.'
