Iona Bain is disappointed that PanOxyl has disappeared  from the shops without explanation

As a consumer journalist, I'm always on the hunt for cracking deals so that I can shave a few pounds off my shopping bill.

But when it comes to skincare, cost considerations don't apply. 

I've bought countless expensive lotions and potions, hoping that just one will clear up my complexion.

You see, I'm one of millions in the UK who have battled 'acne vulgaris', simply known as acne.

This happens when sebaceous glands near the surface of the skin produce too much sebum, or oil, which mixes with dead skin cells.

It blocks the hair follicles, tiny holes in the skin, forming blackheads and whiteheads.

Nasty pustules and cysts occur when those blocked follicles come into contact with otherwise harmless bacteria on the skin's surface.

The condition is believed to affect 80 per cent of those aged between 11 and 30, according to the British Skin Foundation. 

And it can last into adulthood - I'm 27 in March and still expect breakouts whenever life takes a stressful turn. 

I have been plagued by pimples since I was 14 but my condition reached ghastly new heights three years ago. 

When a painful breakout on the side of my neck triggered speculation from a colleague that I was overly fond of love bites, I resolved to find a cure for good.

I tried anything and everything. 

There was high-tech heat therapy, supposed to kill acne-causing bacteria in the skin, as well as French seaweed (known as thalassotherapy). 

But nothing worked.

After spending a small fortune, I finally discovered the miracle - a blackhead-buster that was worth its weight in gold. And it cost £5.

That miracle was PanOxyl, an over-the-counter topical gel.

Its main ingredient was benzoyl peroxide, widely considered the 'gold standard' in acne treatment.

It came to skin specialists' attention in 1963, when Canadian Dr William Pace realised that the ingredient, used to treat infections of hair follicles, was also highly effective for acne.

'It injects air into the pore, helping to remove bacteria, dirt and oil, and is anti-inflammatory,' explains Dr Victor Sagoo of the Solihull Medical Cosmetic Clinic in Warwickshire.

It doesn't contain antibiotics, so resistance isn't a problem, adds Dr Neill Hepburn, a dermatologist at Grantham Hospital in Lincolnshire. 'It's simple, safe and effective.'

For more than a year she used PanOxyl every week until two years ago she was told it had been discontinued

I started using the white cream an hour before bed each night. 

It had a strong antiseptic smell and made my skin tingle, but the next day I noticed a reduction in the size and redness of the spots on my neck and jawline, and within two weeks most were gone, with no scarring.

For more than a year I used PanOxyl every week - until two years ago I was told it had been discontinued.

I found out through social media that the maker of PanOxyl - a U.S.-based GlaxoSmithKline subsidiary called Stiefel - had halted production due to a 'global manufacturing supply issue'. It had been taken off the market, along with other Stiefel acne products.

I was devastated, and so were others. Stiefel's Facebook page has been flooded by complaining customers.

One of them, Ian Charlesworth, a 32-year-old charity worker from Hackney who had been using PanOxyl for two years, said his breakouts returned instantly when he stopped using it. 

'It's a really important product. It would be like Nurofen being pulled from the painkiller market,' he said.

Stiefel representatives have told customers on Facebook that the company is 'expediting a solution for [PanOxyl's] production issues'. Glaxo would not tell Good Health which ingredients were in short supply.

PanOxyl, an over-the-counter topical gel, cost £5

On eBay, benzoyl peroxide products are selling for as much as £299 for a small tube. 

But the British Skin Foundation has urged patients to consult a 'qualified medical professional' rather than buy PanOxyl online.

The problem is that effective alternatives to PanOxyl are hard to come by. Only two out of seven pharmacies I visited in Edinburgh and London could recommend a product with benzoyl peroxide.

Quinoderm is the nearest equivalent - this contains both benzoyl peroxide and potassium hydroxyquinolone sulphate, which is antibacterial. 

But this, too, has been temporarily taken off shelves due to concerns about supply of non-EU approved ingredients.

As Dr George Moncrieff, an Oxfordshire-based GP, says: 'This means there are no benzoyl peroxide products available over the counter. It's a disaster.'

The particular benefit of PanOxyl is that it comes in two strengths of benzoyl peroxide, he adds. The 2.5 per cent formulation, which I used, was perfect for patients with 'milder' acne.

There are other benzoyl peroxide remedies such as Duac and Epiduo, but both require a prescription and contain other ingredients which can be problematic.

The proportion of women over the age of 25 who develop acne 

Duac has 5 per cent benzoyl peroxide, which Dr Moncrieff says can cause dryness, as well as clindamycin phosphate, an antibiotic to which some people may be resistant. Epiduo has 2.5 per cent benzoyl peroxide.

Dr Sagoo also notes that both treatments are much more expensive than Panoxyl, costing from around £14.

Ian Charlesworth has tried both Duac and Epiduo 'but they made my skin very dry and didn't work'.

So why, two years on, has PanOxyl not returned to the shelves?

According to a Glaxosmithkline spokesman, PanOxyl 10 per cent Aquagel and PanOxyl 4 per cent Cream were 'returned to the market earlier this year' - though, like me, others have had trouble obtaining these. 

The spokesman added 'due to strict European regulatory and quality requirements in addition to GSK standards, we were unable to restore other strength formulations at the time'.

There are other options, such as the Pill or acne drug Roaccutane, which reduces the action of the oil glands and bacteria that cause acne. 

But there have been concerns about side-effects - both drugs have been linked to depression and Roaccutane to suicide.

Thankfully, my skin has cleared up of its own accord - I decided to stop using products, only splashing my face with water, though I occasionally resort to my last tube of PanOxyl.

I still hope that miraculous PanOxyl will soon be back on the shelves.
