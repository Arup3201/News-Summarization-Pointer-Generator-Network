When 5-year-old Zoey was first adopted this summer, she slept with slices of pizza and horded scraps of food from the trash can, still traumatized by the years of starvation at the hands of her biological parents.  

Two years ago, Zoey and her two siblings were taken away from biological parents Kenny and Kathleen Sanchez, when a Colorado police officer noticed the then 3-year-old's skeletal frame - severely underweight at just 19 pounds. 

Zoey is now healthy and no longer afraid her food will be taken away from her, seven months after moving in with adoptive parents Amy and Victor Arellano, 9News reports

The little girl's recovery now has an even better ending, as her heartwarming story broadcast around the nation on Wednesday led to the arrest of her biological parents, who have been on the run for the last year and a half. 

Happy ending: Five-year-old Zoey (right) was taken from her biological parents two years ago after a Colorado police officer saw her father strike her in the face, and noticed she was underweight. She has since been adopted by Amy (left) and Victor Arellano

Hungry: When she was taken away from her parents in February 2012, Zoey weighed just 19 pounds. The Arellanos say Zoey would bring slices of pizza to bed and horde food when she first started living with them 

Biological parents: After the story of Zoey's happy recovery and adoption was broadcast around the nation on Wednesday, her fugitive biological parents Kenny (left) and Kathleen Sanchez (right) were arrested more than 1,400 miles away in Foley, Alabama. The two skipped $50,000 bail in July 2013

The Sanchezes were first arrested in February 2012, when an off-duty Boulder, Colorado police officer witnessed Zoey's father hit her in the face in a store when she was hysterically crying out of hunger.

The concerned officer said in a police report that Zoey had 'sagging skin, protruding bones and visible ribs'. He reported the incident to local police and continued to follow the family, including Zoey's then 4-year-old brother and 2-month-old sister Madison, until the parents were arrested. 

Kenny Sanchez told responding officers that his daughter was 'crying uncontrollably because she was hungry' and refused to stop even though he promised to get food 'as soon as they were done shopping'. 

He says he only hit her in the upper left leg 'to get her to stop crying', but responding officers noticed 'numerous bruises and scratches' on the girl they described as 'malnourished'. 

Zoey was taken to the hospital for evaluation where doctors also found multiple bruises and healing scratches on her body and face.   

New life: Amy and Victor Arellano adopted Zoey and her now 2-year-old sister Madison last May. Their older brother was adopted by extended family members 

Family: Amy Arellano (right) is related to Zoey's biological father, and she and her husband have three grown children, and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren 

'They also noted that the victim was extremely malnourished to the point that it was likely to affect her organs,' according to the affidavit.

The parents explained Zoey's weight by saying she had an eating disorder, and had seen doctors in Florida for the issue. While there is evidence Zoey did see out-of-state doctors, it was revealed that her parents did not bring her for follow-up visits.  

The hospital report led police to charge her parents with child abuse, but the two went on the run in July 2013 after posting $50,000 bail each and failing to show up to pre-trial court dates. 

Zoey and her sister Madison, now two, were adopted by the Arellanos  at a Denver Adoption Day event in May, while they brother was adopted by extended family members. Amy Arellano is related to Zoey's biological father, and the couple have three grown children, many grandchildren and several great grandchildren. 

Normal little girl: Among some of Zoey's favorite things are the movie Frozen and chocolate. She hopes to get a baby doll with a stroller for her birthday later this month 

The little girl is now so comfortable with the Arellanos that she calls them mom and dad, but her transition to her new family was not so easy. 

Mrs Arellano says that Zoey was quiet for the first few months, usually not saying anything much more than 'I'm hungry'. 

'She would hover around the trash can when we got her,' she told 9News. 'Finally, she learned it wasn't going to go nowhere. I wasn't going to take it from her.'

On Wednesday, the Colorado station broadcast a story about Zoey's new life with the Arellanos, showing the now-healthy little girl talking about her love of the movie Frozen, chocolate and the presents she wants for her birthday this month.

That story was also broadcast in Mobile, Alabama and within hours Zoey's fugitive parents were arrested at an apartment complex in the town of Foley.
