Letters: Correspondence between Prince Charles and Government ministers is set to be released

Prince Charles's letters to ministers are set to be made public after a court ruled that the Government could not block their publication.  

The Attorney General used a ministerial veto to prevent the correspondence being released to a newspaper under freedom of information laws.

But today one of the country's most senior judges ruled that he had 'no good reason' to do so, in a landmark decision which could open the floodgates for the release of sensitive information.

Attorney General Dominic Grieve has vowed to appeal against the decision at the Supreme Court.  

The letters are said to reveal how the Prince of Wales lobbies members of the Government on issues such as climate change.  

The notes concern Charles's 'most deeply held personal views and beliefs', according to Mr Grieve.  

The Guardian requested the publication of the letters under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the Environmental Information Regulations 2004.  

In September 2012, a tribunal headed by a High Court judge declared that the letters were subject to the legislation and should be released to the newspaper.  

But Mr Grieve exercised his right to a veto, arguing that the letter would damage Charles's 'role as future monarch' because they show him 'disagreeing with Government policy'.  

Today the Master of the Rolls, Lord Dyson, and two other judges overturned the veto because Mr Grieve had no reason to defy the tribunal and was acting illegally under European law.

The case is believed to mark the first time that anyone has challenged the Attorney General's powers to block access to information, which could restrict the Government's ability to keep documents secret.

However, the letters still cannot be published pending the outcome of the Supreme Court appeal. 

Appeal: Attorney General Dominic Grieve has vowed to fight against the decision to overturn his veto

A spokesman for the Attorney General said: 'We are very disappointed by the decision of the court.  

'We will be pursuing an appeal to the Supreme Court in order to protect the important principles which are at stake in this case.'  

The order relates to 27 letters from Charles to seven different Government departments sent between September 2004 and April 2005.  

Dinah Rose QC, for the Guardian, argued that Mr Grieve wanted to block their publication simply because he disagreed with the tribunal judges, adding: 'The implications for the rule of law are grave.'  

Lawyers for the Attorney General told the court that he was entitled 'to take his own view of what was in the public interest'.  

Ruling: A panel of three judges decided that the letters are subject to freedom of information legislation

But today Lord Dyson ruled: 'The Attorney General did not have reasonable grounds for forming the opinion on which the certificate was based.  

'The mere fact that he reached a different conclusion from the Upper Tribunal (UT) in weighing the competing public interests involved was not good enough.  

'He had no good reason for overriding the meticulous decision the UT reached after six days of hearing and argument.  

'He could point to no error or fact in the UT's decision and the Goverrnment departments concerned did not even seek permission to appeal it.  

'The certificate is also unlawful because it is incompatible with EU law.'  

The decision overturns a ruling by three High Court Judges last year who supported Mr Grieve's right to apply his veto.

Prince Charles's office declined to comment on today's ruling.
