Brighton has been voted the worst seaside resort in the UK because it’s too trendy.

Blackpool, Skegness and Bournemouth all beat Brighton in the poll, despite the fact many would consider those towns to be more run-down.

Most holidaymakers were put off by Brighton because of its trendiness, dreadful parking, and the prevalence of clubbers in garish outfits making the most of the town’s famed nightlife.

Some of the 2,500 people polled cited Brighton and Hove City Council’s plans to introduce ‘Mx’ – a gender neutral title for transsexuals – on official forms, and gender neutral toilets as a reason why they disliked the town so much.

Others accused the locals of having ‘chips on their shoulders’ and said the resort was ‘full of bohemians and bad art’.

Brighton topped the poll with 40 per cent of the vote. Blackpool came second on 16 per cent, and Skegness third on 15 per cent.

Scarborough and Bournemouth ranked fourth and fifth, while Torquay and Llandudno seemed to offend the least getting just 5 and 4 per cent of the vote in the poll by the Real Holiday Reports review website.

A report has found that 27 per cent of England’s 31 biggest seaside towns are ‘deprived’.

Brighton did not feature on the list, which was topped by Skegness, Blackpool and Clacton.
