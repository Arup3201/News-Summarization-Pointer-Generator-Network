Diego Costa, Andre Schurrle and Ramires have all been ruled out of Chelsea's Champions League Group G clash with Maribor.

Brazil midfielder Ramires (groin) and German forward Schurrle (illness) trained with the first team on Monday but Costa did not and Jose Mourinho ruled all three out of the game, along with Jon Mikel Obi (foot), on Monday afternoon.

Costa, scorer of nine goals in seven Premier League games for the leaders, also missed Chelsea's 2-1 win over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park and has been hindered by persistent hamstring problems this season.

'It's the same problem he's having. But now an injury, not an almost injury. It's simple. He's not training because he is not in condition to do so,' Mourinho said. 'I have no idea how long. Tomorrow he cannot play. The weekend (against Manchester United) is not important but he cannot play tomorrow.' 

Costa's absence presents an opportunity for either Didier Drogba or Loic Remy to stake a claim for a regular place in the side.

Remy, a summer signing from Queens Park Rangers, deputised in place of Costa on Saturday against Palace, but was unable to find the back of the net. 

And Mourinho hopes that whoever he selects can lead Chelsea to what he considers a vital three points. 

'It is important to win. It is not an easy group. Sporting are a good team and playing better and better and better. Schalke are a good team with Roberto Di Matteo as coach.

'We have four points and need seven to have stability for the second half of the group. Not to qualify but for stability.'

Mourinho will be boosted by the performances of Cesc Fabregas, Eden Hazard and Oscar against Palace.

Fabregas hopes they can keep up their free-flowing passing combinations that caused so much damage to Palace at the weekend.

'I like to play this kind of football, and Eden and Oscar do as well, and the three of us connect very well,' Fabregas said after the Palace win.

‘Now I am playing deeper in midfield there will be moments during the season when maybe I go five or six games without a goal or an assist, and I am more proud about the team work.

‘We played a good second half when 10 against 10. We did have difficulties in the first few minutes but thankfully Oscar scored a fantastic goal and it helped us, and 10 against 10 is a different game and it was a solid performance.’

Fabregas has scored twice since his arrival at Chelsea in the summer, including a goal against Schalke in the Champions League.
