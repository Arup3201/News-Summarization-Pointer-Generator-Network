Victims of flooding just weeks ago faced further clean-ups today after rivers burst their banks again across the North - but forecasters predict the weather will improve.

Thirteen separate flood warnings were issued across the Yorkshire region, the majority of which were in York and surrounding villages.

In Oxfordshire, a road on land that had been flooded recently was closed after it was torn apart by subsidence.

The Environment Agency said 76 flood warnings - meaning flooding is expected and immediate action should be taken - were in force nationwide today.

There were also 109 flood alerts nationwide, warning residents to be on their guard as floods are expected.

Many of the communities affected have been trying to get back on their feet after serious localised flooding in November.

An Environment Agency spokesman said: 'Despite the improving weather conditions, there is a continued risk of localised flooding over the next few days as river and groundwater levels are still high.'

Riverside communities along the Ouse in Yorkshire and Thames are among those at risk, the spokesman added.

Groundwater levels are high in Berkshire, south Gloucestershire and parts of Lincolnshire and temporary flood defences remain in place along the Severn at several locations including Ironbridge and Upton.

The River Ouse in central York, which has flooded several times in the past few weeks, has burst its banks again and is currently more than 13ft (4m) above its average summer level.

Pumps were being used to clear water from pubs, restaurants, homes and hotels along its banks today. Many of the businesses hit were in the process of being renovated and have not been able to reopen since November's deluge.

Residents in several villages along the 
Ouse to the south of the city, including Fulford, Acaster Selby, Acaster
Malbis and Naburn, were either flooded or cut off by standing water.

Valerie Brown, who has lived in the village of Acaster Malbis for 50 years, was mopping up dark brown floodwater and silt in her riverside cottage today.

'We were flooded at the end of October, at the end of November, on Christmas Eve it threatened - it came right on to the doorstep - and then again at New Year.

'It's been a different New Year. I 
can't recommend it. We hadn't got the house right again since the end of
November because we were going to have the walls replastered. We 
haven't got that done.

'The ironic thing is we ordered floodgates. If we'd had them last night we'd have been fine.'

Tourists
staying on a caravan site in nearby Naburn said they were marooned, 
unable to get on or off the site, after knee-high water engulfed roads 
through the village.

One said: 'We can't move. I was meant to be back at work today but we can't go anywhere.'

The Highways Agency said none of Britain's major roads have been closed due to flooding

Forecasters say the wet weather will improve with conditions drying out through the week

The Highways Agency said none of Britain's major roads have been closed due to flooding.

The
Environment Agency said areas that were worst-affected today, including
York's surrounding villages and Wargrave, Purley and Shiplake along the
Thames, should experience an improvement in coming days as the water 
recedes.

Work is also 
taking place to ensure that rivers can drain and flow freely in other 
parts of southern England, including Dorset, Hampshire, Wiltshire, West 
and East Sussex, it added.

The Met Office said dryer weather is due for the remainder of this week and into the weekend, with less rain expected next week. In Cornwall, the first daffodils of the year were seen.

Forecaster
Charlie Powell said: 'Those conditons will, by and large, last through 
the rest of the weekend and the theme of much more settled conditions 
will continue until at least Monday.'

Forecasters
say 2012 is currently the fourth wettest year for the UK since records 
began in 1910 and, with the rainfall over the last week, the likelihood 
of it becoming a new record is being 'closely watched'.

In Oxfordshire, a rift opened up along a road surface, exposing layers of earth to the shock of neighbours and road users.

The route, which links Oxford to the nearby market town of Abingdon, was closed to traffic after it was torn apart by subsidence.

A deluge of rain over the Christmas holidays was the final straw for the Oxford Road in Boars Hill, near Oxford, which is regularly used by traffic attempting to avoid the A34 dual carriageway.

Cracks stretch to up to two-feet wide in places and the rural through-road has been closed and sealed off by engineers.

The white centre lines were shifted over to one side as the road sank - and the damage could get even worse with forecasters predicting more downpours next week.

Highways bosses have now been faced with having to replace the road surface entirely.

'It's obviously going to take some fixing,' said Owen Morton, spokesman for Oxford County Council. 'It's subsidence. There's been a lot of heavy rain and that can cause this sort of damage.'

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson and members of the Environment Agency study the flood defences at Upton upon Severn, Worcestershire

Flood-hit communities will continue to get Government support but will have to wait a while longer for a deal to be done on affordable insurance cover, the Environment Secretary has said.

Owen Paterson, who was touring flood defences in Worcestershire today, praised the response of emergency services and the Environment Agency for reacting 'heroically' to recent national flooding triggered by the wettest year on record.

He said the Government had already committed to funding schemes protecting about 145,000 homes, and was putting more money into defences.

'Over the spending review period (to 2015) we had already pledged £2.71billion and on top of that the Chancellor already announced in his Autumn Statement a further £120million to protect a further 60,000 homes,' he said.

Mr Paterson also said partnership schemes had raised another £72million from the private sector.However, he said there has been no deal done yet with the Association of British Insurers (ABI) over the issue of affordable flood insurance for householders in areas of high risk.

Negotiations have been going on since last year to replace the current agreement, known as the Statement of Principles - which ends in July - but so far the Government and the ABI have been unable to come to terms.

Mr Paterson said his colleague, Oliver Letwin, a Cabinet Office minister, met the director-general of the ABI before Christmas, 'and we await them coming back to us with a constructive proposal'.

He added he was 'not going to negotiate in public' but said the Government wanted 'a system which is better, comprehensive, and which is affordable and does not burden the taxpayer'.

Mr Paterson said making flood insurance affordable was 'a huge and complex problem' and he would not set a date for the conclusion of talks. We are confident we can reach a resolution,' he said.

The £120million of funding - the first tranche of which will be released in the coming financial year - is split equally, with half going towards major flood defences that protect infrastructure, homes and businesses.

The other £60million is being allocated through a partnership fund which allows businesses, councils and developers to pay towards some of the costs of defences.

About 20 new schemes are already going ahead this year, in locations including Manchester, Louth and Warrington, said Pete Fox, the Environment Agency's head of strategy and investment.

He said the additional government money would be allocated on a 'case-by-case basis' and areas would need to bid for the cash.

'We go to an area and look at the causes of flooding and then look to see if solutions can be provided for those causes,' he said.

'If councils want to go it alone we can offer them support, but it's a national pot of money and they'll be participating against everyone else for it.'

Between 7,500 and 8,000 households have been flooded since July, culminating in the major flooding over Christmas and New Year.

Mr Fox also said about 100,000 homes had been protected from incidences of flooding over the same period because of the construction of more defences, better weather forecasting, and closer working between the emergency services, councils and the agency, sparked by the huge floods of summer 2007.
