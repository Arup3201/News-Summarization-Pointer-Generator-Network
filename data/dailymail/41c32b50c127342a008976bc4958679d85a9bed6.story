When un-retouched photographs of, what appeared to be, a L'Oreal campaign starring Beyonce leaked last night the internet was sent into a tail spin and the unflattering pictures went viral.

The unflattering images of the usually flawless star, which show bumpy-looking skin and harsh make-up, were tweeted, blogged, Instagrammed and re-grammed thousands upon thousands of times. 

But while some have been cruel about the appearance of the singer's complexion, the majority of  have been quick to support the singer, jumping to her defence.

When photographs of Beyonce, thought to be from her L'Oreal make-up shoot leaked online people were quick to register their shock at her less than flawless look 

In fact, users took to Twitter to criticise those who had expressed their shock at the images and one user named @liannefielding said: 'If you are shocked at the leaked pictures of Beyonce then please take a long hard look at yourself.' 

Another named @Kicka**_bonet said: 'I don't care for Beyonce but I'm glad those pictures leaked. She's an actual person & it's deceiving of the media to retouch for perfection.' 

One named @MelanieCoMcCoy said: 'So Beyonce is actually a human being, Shocking! She's still beautiful. We all have blemishes. Leaking those photos was in very poor taste.' 

Meanwhile,  FEMAIL readers told us they feel empowered by seeing images of Beyonce with her flaws on show.

Sophie Herman, 29, told us: 'It makes me feel amazing to know that she doesn't have a defined jaw line and, if anything, a little angry that this whole time I've been looking in the mirror hating mine, when it's obviously a problem even she has.

'Also, her make-up looks like end-of-the-night make-up, which I think is reassuring as it shows the power of retouching. Maybe we all look like Beyonce at the end of an evening.

The images, which have been shared thousands of times show Beyonce with pimply skin and neck lines

Some users took to Twitter to post mean comments about the leaked pictures of Beyonce

But Sophie also said that she doesn't feel tricked by Photoshopping as she knows it's part of advertising: 'I don't even really mind about her skin, I could guess that that was probably glossed over to make the pictures look a little more smooth.'

And Isabelle Broom, 37, from London, agreed: 'I think it's a good thing that the pictures leaked. Girls need to realise that women are real and not dolls. And she still looks great anyway.'

The images, however, did stir up a sense of resentment at the celebrity culture of doctoring pictures.

She said: 'Perfection on those airbrushed terms is simply un-achievable, and it's wrong that we're led to believe that flawlessness equals greatness.'

Women took to Twitter to react to the Beyonce photo leak with one saying that those who were shocked needed to take a long hard look at themselves 

Gemma Cardle, 35, said: 'Although it can be refreshing to see that even women with all the money in the world to spend on their appearance, still suffer from 'real' problems like bad skin, it's not a reason to  gloat about it.

'No one enjoys having their spotty pictures put out in the world and if this was on Facebook any of us would immediately click 'de-tag'.

'Here, the lighting seems so harsh that anyone's skin would look bad under it, and the make-up itself just doesn't suit her - the red lipstick looks sticky, the eye-liner makes her usually beautiful eyes look small and a bit squinty.

'Ultimately Beyonce is one of the most stunning women in the world and a bad photo isn't going to take that away from her.'

Olivia Rose, a photographer from London, said: 'The fact that we all care so much is the sad thing. I don't re-touch my images but I light them in a flattering way, to me it just shows how much these photographers rely on post-production to make an image nowadays.'

In this shot the singer shows off her natural beauty but many have pointed out that the photographic light will not have been flattering for her skin

Fans have said that they don't feel let down by Beyonce because they expect her to be airbrushed and they think she looks great in the pictures anyway

We also spoke to Claire Culley the editor of The W Review a positive, honest online community for women.

She said: 'Unfortunately in the modern society that we live in, retouching is considered the norm. So much so that when a photo is leaked of a un-retouched image it's front page news. 

'At the end of the day each and every woman, has something about their body that they aren't happy with or that they wish they could change.

'Instead of focusing on a muffin top or a double chin, or in Beyonce's case her face, we should be focusing on their achievements.'

In a L'Oreal advert from 2013 Beyonce is seen with flawless skin which looks like it has been Photoshopped

Claire continued: 'The women who are retouched in the media aren't just models, they are career women who have achieved brilliant success. 

'Be it actresses, designers or women in business. When we look at these images they should feel inspired by their accomplishments, not distracted at how shiny their hair looks or how smooth their skin is.

'In reality, all women are a little bit lumpy and bumpy. So instead of airbrushing that out we should instead be embracing the real woman that has worked her socks off to even be in that magazine in the first place'

Photographer Nik Pate, who doctors photographs himself said: 'Everyone needs to be reminded that more often than not the imagery that we see on a daily basis is hyper-real and has seen many hours of Photoshop.

'We have become numb to this and our demand for flawless perfection puts pressure on those in the media, we shouldn't be shocked by these unedited images - it's nice to be reminded that everyone is human.' 

In 2010 Britney Spears sanctioned the release of these images of herself by the company Candies, the images show how different advertising shots can be from the originals 

In the before and after images Britney shows how her image has been altered with her bum made smaller and her cellulite removed 

Of course this isn't the first time that a celebrity has fallen foul of a leak like this. And in some cases they have even encouraged companies to show off their unedited pictures. 

In 2010 Britney Spears Candies release edited and unedited images of herself, clearly showing how her image had been altered. 

Despite being naturally slim in one set of after pictures where Britney is facing the camera the singer was given a smaller waist as well as slimmer thighs, she also had her bruises removed.

In an after shot where she has her back to the camera she has had her tattoo removed, her bum made smaller and her cellulite removed. 

In the final poster for King Arthur Keira Knightly had had her breasts considerably enlarged 

When Keira Knightley starred in the film King Arthur the poster for the movie had given her with considerably larger breasts than she has in real life.

Keira wasn't that concerned that her body had been altered but she didn't like  the shape of her breasts.

She said: 'I was only angry when they were really droopy... For King Arthur, for a poster, they gave me these really strange droopy tits. I thought, well if you're going to make me fantasy breasts, at least make perky breasts.'

Most recently an unretouched picture of original supermodel Cindy Crawford was published on Twitter, showing her in a set of lingerie.

It was first thought it was for the April 2015 issue of Marie Claire magazine but then have since revealed it was taken from a shoot done in 2013.

The magazine then released a statement in which they praised the model saying: 'It is real, it is honest, and it is gorgeous.' 

They went on to say, 'It's an enlightenment—we've always known Crawford was beautiful, but seeing her like this only makes us love her more.'

Similarly Twitter users praised Cindy with one woman named @Lind82 saying, 'She looks amazing, why can't magazines just show women as they are? 'Cindy Crawford Photo Leak.''

Whilst another named @Tracey_lou said, 'bravo to Cindy Crawford for releasing her untouched photos. Brave and beautiful #women #advertising' 

Lady Gaga, Madonna, Katy Perry and Lena Dunham have all also had pictures leaked. When Katy covered Rolling Stone in 2010 they appeared to give her larger breasts. 

And when Gaga shot a campaign for Versace in 2010 they significantly smoothed out her skin. 

Airbrushing is commonplace within the media and fashion industries where women and men are often portrayed to have flawless skin and bodies. 

Yet for someone, the release of their undoctored pictures just make them look even better. When Petra Nemcova posed for the new Ultimo underwear collection, the picture of her posing in a bra pre-Photoshop revealed just how flawless the model really is.
