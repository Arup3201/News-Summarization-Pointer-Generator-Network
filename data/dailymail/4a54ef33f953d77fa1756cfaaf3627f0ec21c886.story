Loss: Milton Olin Jr., the former COO of Napster, was killed by a police patrol car on Sunday

The former director of operations for Napster has been killed after his bicycle was struck by a sheriff deputy's patrol car on Sunday.

Milton Everett Olin, Jr., 65, a married prominent lawyer and the former COO for the music streaming site, was hit by the Los Angeles county sheriff's vehicle in Calabasas, California around 1pm.

Both the car and the cyclist were 
heading eastbound when they collided, smashing the patrol car's 
windshield.

Images from the scene show the crumpled bike by the car's 
front tires.

Olin was pronounced dead at the scene 
and the deputy involved, who has not been identified, was taken to a 
hospital for treatment of minor injuries.

He was left with glass in his eyes and cuts on an arm, according to CBS Los Angeles.

The deputy will be formerly interviewed about the incident on Monday.

Police
 have not given any indications as to who was at fault in the accident 
but did confirm that Olin was in the bike lane when he was struck.

The driver was on a routine patrol when the accident occurred and was not responding to an emergency.

Speed, drugs and alcohol are not believed to be factors in the crash, Sgt. Joseph Jaki said.

'It's
 very tough when we're involved in an accident like this because it's 
our job to protect the people and help people and we're obviously very 
sad that something like this has happened,' Jaki said.

The sheriff's Traffic Services Detail was investigating the fatality, authorities added.

Olin, from Woodland Hills, had been a lawyer for 38 years and practiced business, labor and employment and intellectual property law from a firm he co-founded, Altschul & Olin LLC in Encino.

According to his LinkedIn profile, he 
was the COO of Napster between 2000 and 2002. Napster was a file sharing
 site for music before coming an online music store.

Before his job with Napster, he worked for A&M Records as vice president of business development and was responsible for signing artists and acquiring music rights.

Olin
 was married and lived in a $1 million home in Woodland Hills.

He leaves behind two sons. One son, Chris, is a brain 
scientist with whom Olin worked as a portfolio manager for an investment
 company.

One relative, 
Geoffrey, posted a picture with Olin and Chris on Facebook, adding: 'You
 were the best I could have ever hoped for. Life was good and I love 
you. WE ALL DO.'
