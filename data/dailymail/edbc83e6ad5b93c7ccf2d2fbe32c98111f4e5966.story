A benefit cheat who claimed over £17,000 because he couldn't walk more than 15 yards has walked free from court despite being photographed running a half marathon.

Shameless Noel Sanders, 55, told authorities that he suffered from crippling arthritis and high blood pressure - leaving him unable to even cut up his own food.

But instead he was an active member of his local running club, rising to the position of club secretary.

Sanders, from Brierly Hill, West Mids, pleaded guilty to two counts of failing to notify authorities of a change of circumstances at Dudley Magistrates Court on Friday.

He was handed a 12-week prison sentence, suspended for six months, and ordered to undergo a 12 month community order.

The court heard that sneaky Sanders had been assessed in 2002 and awarded the highest rate of disability living allowance due to his illness.

He told officials he needed help seven days a week to get out of bed, dress himself and go to the toilet. He claimed he could not prepare his own meals and couldn't even manage to cut up meat himself.

Sanders even told officials he needed someone with him whenever he went outside in case he collapsed.

Between 2009, when he took up running again, and January 2013 Sanders claimed £12,290.35 in Disability Living Allowance and £5,173.37 in Job Seekers Allowance.

He was caught when DWP officials discovered he was a member of nearby Stourbridge Running Club, who then provided a picture of Sanders running the Coll Half Marathon.

Sentencing him, Dawn Gill, Chair of the bench said: 'The sentence is 12 weeks with regard to the DLA and 12 weeks for the JSA, they will run concurrently.

'We have taken into account the fact that this offence is so serious that it cannot be dealt with by a community order alone.

'We require that you complete the benefit fraud workbook, if you break this order or commit another offence you can expect to serve your prison sentence.

'These offences were carried out over a significant period of time and the value of the crime was in excess of £17,000.

'We also take into account the blatant nature of the offence in that you have been running marathons while claiming this level of disability.

'You have taken action, we are told you have repaid all the money.'

Suki Rai, prosecuting, told the court: 'The club chairman confirmed that he was a member of the club, and that he had been club secretary for two years.

'He said he had never seen the defendant using a walking aid and that he was a slow runner but walked normally.

'He said that the defendant had run many races, he had run 10 kilometre races and 20 mile races.

'He had run 27 races for the club and his fastest half marathon time was 2 hours 29 minutes.

'The chairman also said he had run cross country races with him, where the ground would be uneven and slippery.'

She added that when confronted Sanders had tried to talk his way out of the offences.

She added: 'When he was presented with the evidence the defendant said he had taken up running again and lost weight after he became scared when his father died.

'He said he had used techniques to run through the pain and that he had been in excruciating pain while running.

'He claimed he had tried to ask officials how his running would affect his claim and was told that if the change was permanent his allowance would be stopped and if it was only temporary it would continue.'

Jahangeer Aslam, defending, said: 'Mr Sanders tells me he feels devastated, forlorn and regretful.

'He suffers from arthritis, high blood pressure, and is on 14 different medications.

'He tells me he used to weigh 16 stone but has lost weight and now weighs around 11, which has contributed to his improved mobility.

'The DWP have confirmed that he has paid back the money, he did this using an inheritance he received from his father.

'He is looking for work at the moment that he can do with his conditions.

'He tells me he has a sister he is in contact with, and no other relatives. He said he does have a friend and he feels stupid and embarrassed that he has let down the society he was a part of.

'He has not lived an extravagant lifestyle, and he will have to live with the consequences of what he has done for the rest of his life."

Sanders was ordered to pay £100 costs.
