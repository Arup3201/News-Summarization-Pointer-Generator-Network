Thousands of Eurostar passengers were facing travel chaos today as 17 trains were cancelled following a death on the high speed line.

Services were delayed for five hours after a person was hit by a train near Harrietsham in Kent. 

Dejected-looking travellers were pictured crammed into the terminal at St Pancras station - with some customers on axed services facing delays of up to two days while the backlog clears.

Frustrated: Thousands of Eurostar passengers cram into the terminal at St Pancras station in London today

Investigators from British Transport Police said the death, which happened at around 11.40am, was 'non-suspicious' although it took hours for services teams to clear the tracks.

Services resumed at around 4.30pm in both directions, although hundreds of customers were left trying to organise alternative transport or accommodation in London on Monday night.

Demo Oduyeni, 38, spoke of his frustration at clueless staff who told him he would have to wait until Wednesday to travel home to Antwerp.

He said: 'The people I spoke to didn't know anything, they just kept saying check the updates on the website, but on the website there was nothing.

Huge delays: Dejected customers waited in St Pancras after the line was shut following the incident in Kent

'When I got here it just said we had to queue up as someone had jumped in front of a train.

'I've been waiting here for two hours now just in case I can get on one of the trains. It's cold and I've been buying myself cups of tea to keep warm. I've been told I will probably have to wait until Wednesday to get home.

'By the time I get on a train tonight it will be too late to get a transfer, I could get a bus but it will take over six hours. Tomorrow all the booked Eurostar passengers will take priority.'

The Belgian computer programmer was a regular traveller and had been visiting friends. 

He added: 'I studied here and they will give me a place to stay, but the tourists will have to find hotels. 

'They only give you £150-a-night for a room and you have to send an invoice.'

'Eurostar trains are subject to delay and cancellation this afternoon,' the company said in a statement on its website.

Eurostar runs trains through the Channel Tunnel, operated by Eurotunnel, connecting passengers between the British and French capitals, and other cities including Brussels. 

The company said emergency services were attending the incident in between Ashford International station and Ebbsfleet International station in Kent and travel on the high-speed line would resume when the track was re-opened.

Laurens Schellekens, 23, was one of 35 University of Brussels students left stranded as they made their way home from the London International Model United Nations conference for budding diplomats.

The international law postgraduate said: 'We've been working all weekend and had to cut our day off to explore the city short after we heard the trains weren't running.

'We've been left in the cold station waiting to see if we will get on a train tomorrow, but it's not looking good.

'There was at least 100 students at the conference, they come from all around the world.

'But there were maybe five at least groups from Belgium and France that may be in the same situation as us.

'We've been given money to find somewhere to stay, but it's an expensive city to do anything in.

'The group have been modelling crisis management, maybe we could show the train guys something.'
