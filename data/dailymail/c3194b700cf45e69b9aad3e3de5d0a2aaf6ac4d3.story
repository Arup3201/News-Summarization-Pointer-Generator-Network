A New York barista who started doodling in the froth on top of the coffees he served has become famous for the astonishingly intricate portraits he creates.

Mike Breach, who is also an artist, began his unusual hobby out of boredom last year, trying to see what picture he could create in the lattes he made while working in a hotel in NYC.

Now he has become the celebrities' favourite and had stars including Chelsea Clinton queuing up to have him draw their portrait in the froth on their drink.

Mr Breach uses a bamboo skewer as a paintbrush and draws astonishingly intricate and realistic portraits in the latte foam.

He began by drawing simple images, such as hearts, but soon moved on to more complicated pictures of historical figures such as William Shakespeare and Che Guevara, characters from popular culture like Batman, and celebrities including The Doors' Jim Morrison.

The downside of his work is that the pictures rarely last longer than three minutes - the life-expectancy of the crema on top of a latte.

And the lattes can go cold while you're admiring the artwork.

But as a way to gain speedy fame on the internet - Mr Breach has his own Tumblr - a talent for turning lattes into art is surely a good one.

The artist told visualnews.com: 'I kind of want to be like Willy Wonka with coffee - make it interesting and fun for people; take the pretentiousness out of it, take the seriousness out of it.'
