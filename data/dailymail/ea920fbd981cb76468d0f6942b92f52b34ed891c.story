Terror experts believe a Canadian woman dubbed 'Toronto Jane' could be a senior ISIS leader after she was tracked visiting all of the terror group's stronghold over the past three weeks.

The mysterious jihadi, who is thought to have only left Canada in late-November, uses the Twitter name Lama Sharif al-Shammari, although counter-terror analysts refer to her as 'LA'.

They have been able to follow her visiting ISIS' Syrian strongholds of Raqqa and Deir Ezzor in recent weeks, as well as the Iraqi city of Mosul, because she has left geocoding activated on her mobile phone, effectively tagging every Twitter message she posts with details of her location.

Although hundreds of Western women have joined the terror group, the locations she has visited and the speed with which she moves around is unprecedented for a female ISIS jihadi and suggests she has quickly risen through the ranks of the terror group.

Restricted: Although hundreds of Western women are known to have travelled to join ISIS, then the majority marry a fighter and settle into a life of cooking, cleaning and childbearing

The Florida-based Terrorism Research & Analysis Consortium have been tracking al-Shammari since her arrival in the Middle East, using the geocodes she inadvertently attaches to every tweet to follow 'LA's' movements around the vast swathes of Syria and Iraq under ISIS' control.

The experts say they have never seen a female ISIS fighter moving so frequently and so rapidly, which suggests 'LA' is operating in a senior capacity, possibly in surveillance or spying role.

Another option is that she is a messenger or courier for the terror group's leadership and is used to pass covert operational and security details between senior militants who are reluctant to risk having the information intercepted by internet or phone taps.

Whatever the reality, it is clear that 'LA' - who is understood to be a Canadian national of Saudi descent - has made an unprecedented rise within ISIS since her arrival in Syria on December 8.

Before her departure, terror experts had simply considered her a terror sympathiser thanks to her penchant for posting pro-ISIS messages on Twitter from Toronto. It is not known how she arrived in Syria, but she is thought to have left Canada sometime after November 23.

Within days of her arrival she had changed her Twitter banner image to a shocking photograph of the severed head of a Syrian soldier, according to National Post. She also started posting brazen messages celebrating atrocities by the terror group.

Some woman do join ISIS all-female police force known as the Al-Khansa Brigade. However these women still stay in the city in which they operate and do not travel around ISIS-held territory particularly frequently 

Speaking of her unexplained rise, TRAC's Veryan Khan told Fox News: 'What is really surprising is that in a very short period of time, L.A. appears to have taken an extremely active role with ISIS.'

'We have never seen someone move about this rapidly...  What makes it even more unusual is that she is newly traveled to Islamic State. Having only been there since Dec. 8, it is odd that she would become so active so quickly once arriving,' he added.

'Based on 'LA's' locations and congruent battles in these locations, it is been assumed that she is conducting, at least on some level, surveillance for the Islamic State,' he went on to say. 

Although hundreds of Western women are known to have travelled to join ISIS in the Middle East, the vast majority of them marry and fighter and settle into a life of cooking, cleaning and childbearing in whatever city they are instructed to settle down.

Most will leave their homes only rarely after marriage and even then usually only to go shopping, so they idea that one woman is buzzing around ISIS' territory suggests she is a high ranking militant.

Another possibility is that she married a militant of such prominence that the usual expectation of settling her family in one place is unrealistic, as the home would immediately become a target for Western and Arab airstrikes.

'LA' has only used her Twitter account to send 131 Tweets and is understood to have just 145 followers, meaning her social media presence pales in comparison to that of other Western jihadis.

All of her messages are in Arabic and their content suggests she is a member Al-Shamry tribe of Saudi Arabian origin. She often posts hate-filled messages about the Saudi royal family.

Despite the seeming innocuity of her messages, TRAC have been able to locate the exact homes from which many of them have been sent - proving many of the messages were sent from properties known to be used by 'key players' within ISIS.

It is not possible for geocoding to be faked, and many people are unaware that their phone is always giving off information about their whereabouts unless the function is manually turned off.

Although ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi does not have a Twitter account himself, several prominent ISIS commanders do maintain a social media presence. 

The internet has so far proved an invaluable tool in ISIS' campaign of terror, with the militants using social media to recruit fighters and jihadi brides and to distribute propaganda, including the horrific murder videos of Western hostages.
