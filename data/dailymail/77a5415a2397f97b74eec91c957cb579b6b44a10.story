The BBC is planning to charge up to £5 for its hit programmes in a challenge  to online services such as Netflix and iTunes.

As part of an ambitious online revamp, the Corporation has already tested a BBC Store from which viewers will be able to buy episodes or series months or years after they are first broadcast.

Hit shows including Doctor Who, Luther, Sherlock, Horrible Histories, Murphy’s Law and Sir David Attenborough’s Human Planet will be for sale when the service launches next year.

iPlayer: The service will remain, but some backdated programmes could soon cost up to £5 to download

The BBC eventually hopes to offer downloads of almost every show it makes.

Programmes on the free- to-use iPlayer will be also made available for 30 days instead of the current seven.

One BBC source, who asked not to be named, said: ‘It is a no-brainer. At the moment viewers can only buy shows on DVD in somewhere like W H Smith.

‘Luther would be offered for about 99p an episode and other series are being offered for about £5.’

The first series of the crime drama can be purchased from iTunes for £5.99 and can also be watched on Netflix – which charges subscribers £5.99 a month to stream shows over the internet.

The BBC’s plans still need to be approved by its governing body, but bosses have already begun testing the idea with focus groups.

Doctor Who will be included in the programmes to be charged for - which will still be cheaper than DVDs

Volunteers are being asked to study mocked-up pages from the BBC Store website, which display a particular show together with details of its price and how to buy it.

A page for the crime drama Luther, starring Idris Elba, includes a price of 99p per episode or £1.49 for three – though a source last night said these were guide prices based on charges being offered by other services.

Rob Wilson MP last night warned the BBC against overcharging licence-fee payers.

He said: ‘It raises significant questions about what the licence-fee payer is actually paying for and whether the current system works in a digital age.’

A spokesman for the BBC said: ‘We know people want to keep older programmes so we hope to launch BBC Store. This commercial online service will give people the opportunity to own a digital copy – just like they can on DVD – to watch and keep.’
