Chic in a grey Whistles dress with her long blonde hair perfectly coiffed, the newly promoted Esther McVey looked ready for action as she arrived at Downing Street this morning.

The Conservative MP for Wirral West is one of a number of rising stars promoted to Cabinet positions in today's reshuffle - and one of the most glamorous.

A former GMTV presenter, Ms McVey, 46, looks set to give home secretary Theresa May, herself a fashion fan, a run for her money in the style stakes.

Like the home secretary, Ms McVey is partial to a fabulous pair of shoes; picking a dove grey pair of suede wedges for her meeting with the prime minister.

As a former TV presenter, McVey knows exactly how important image is, and will no doubt have picked out her outfit with care. While the minister for employment and disabilities has often spoken of her love for fashion, she boasts a CV that's just as impressive as her wardrobe.

A former GMTV and children's TV presenter, Liverpudlian Ms McVey became Conservative MP for Wirral West in 2010 and has climbed rapidly through the ranks of the Tory party.

Close friends with Kate McCann, she helped the family set up the Madeleine McCann Fund and established her own successful business, which provided business space and office training for start up firms.

Highly rated by No. 10 for her impressive performances in the Commons and in the media, her new role means she will sit in on Cabinet meetings while continuing to handle the disabilities and employment brief.

And Ms McVey certainly isn't alone. Joining her and the impressive Theresa May at the Cabinet table is Loughborough MP Nicky Morgan, the new education secretary, and South West Norfolk's Liz Truss MP who takes the environment brief.

Like McVey and May, both women are sharp dressers who have brought businesslike wardrobes featuring neat pencil skirts and serious tailored jackets to their high-powered roles.

While some might be mourning the loss of Michael Gove, Owen Paterson and William Hague, the new look Cabinet is set to be a very stylish - and successful - place to be.
