This is the shocking moment a car bounced off the front of a lorry on a busy motorway sending it flying across the road after the driver pulled out without checking their mirrors.

The HGV was travelling in the middle lane of the M6 in Staffordshire at 35mph during wet weather conditions when it approached a blue Nissan Note.

The car driver then forgot to check their mirrors and pulled out to change lanes, clipping the lorry and losing control before bouncing across the carriageway. 

The lorry, which was fitted with a dash cam, was travelling along the M6 in Staffordshire when it approached a blue Nissan Note 

The driver of the blue Nissan appears to forget to check their mirrors and pulls out in front of the HGV 

The Nissan was sent spinning so it ended up facing oncoming traffic before it clipped the side of a £50,000 BMW 5 Series GT.

It then came to a halt after rolling backwards through traffic cones.

Fortunately no one was injured during the crash, which took place earlier this year.

However, the driver of the Nissan then blamed the lorry driver for the incident when it came to an insurance claim.

But the trucker had a dash cam fitted and the insurers of Nissan driver settled the claim as soon as the were shown the footage. 

Simon Marsh, managing director of SmartWitness, which made the dash cam, said: 'This new video perfectly illustrates the camera's worth.

'These incidents in the days before cameras would result in a big drain on time and expense as both sides argued it out with insurers and also risked damaging hauliers’ insurance claim experience.

'Not any more - the footage goes off and it is settled almost instantly.'

The blue Note ends up facing oncoming traffic and eventually clips the side of a BMW 5 Series before coming to a halt near to the traffic cones 

Thousands of similar incidents happen on Britain’s roads each year - with both drivers blaming each other for the collision.

More and more motorists are buying dash cams though in the event they find themselves in a criminal or insurance dispute.

The Road Haulage Association recently found that 54 per cent of its members have now fitted in-cab cameras.

There are around 550,000 whiplash claims filed every year in the UK, but insurance experts have estimated that up to 60 per cent are bogus.

Since 2006, there has been a 60 per cent rise in the number of personal injury claims.This is despite number of reported accidents on UK roads dropping by 20 per cent during the same period.
