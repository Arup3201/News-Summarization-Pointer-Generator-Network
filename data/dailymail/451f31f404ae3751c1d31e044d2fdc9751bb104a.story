A convicted killer, who stabbed a man 40 times in a jealous rage, has been given a job at a hospital.

Unions have raised concerns over the employment of Robert Bage at the University Hospital of North Durham after it was revealed his employers had no idea about his violent past.

Bage, originally from the Durham area, stabbed Andrew Stanyer in 1991 after becoming jealous of the man’s relationship with his former partner and was jailed for life.

No idea of conviction: Robert Bage was jailed for life but after he was released on licence he got a job at the University Hospital of North Durham (pictured) while employers were unaware of his violent past

Following his release from prison on licence he was employed by the County Durham and Darlington NHS Trust hospital in the hospital kitchens, it is believed.

In a statement from Balfour Beatty Workplace (BBW), the trust’s Private Finance Initiative partner, said that Bage worked in a ‘non-patient facing role’ but that they were not made aware of his previous convictions during the employment process.

The statement read: ‘Once this matter was brought to the attention of BBW, the employee was suspended and an investigation commenced immediately.

‘Mr Bage no longer works with BBW.’

It is believed that he has not worked at the hospital for at least two months.

Public service trade union Unison plan to hold talks with staff at the hospital after details of Bage’s employment emerged.

Frenzied attack: Bage hid in his former partner's loft in Stoke (pictured) before stabbing Andrew Stanyer 40 times with a kitchen knife

Sheila Wilson, a regional organiser for Unison, said: ‘We are extremely concerned that the recruitment process has allowed this to happen.’

Bage hid in the loft of his former partner’s home in Stoke, Staffordshire before stabbing Mr Stanyer in a frenzied attack, starting when his victim was asleep.

Bage was due to be released on licence in March 2005 and was expected to live in the North East. His current whereabouts are unknown.

At the time, Mr Stanyer’s brother, Alan, said a life sentence should mean Bage would never be released.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
