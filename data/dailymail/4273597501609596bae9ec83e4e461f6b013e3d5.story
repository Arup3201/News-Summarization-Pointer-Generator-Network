He could almost pass for Santa if he had more real teeth than tattoos, didn't chain-smoke and rode with reindeer instead of on a motor tricycle. 

To thousands of admirers he was the Kings Cross Santa Claus. And just like Santa's fabled North Pole workshop, this old biker's tiny inner-city home was packed year-round with Christmas gifts.

For two decades, Randall 'Animal' Nelson spent part of every day in his sixth-floor public housing unit at Waterloo, in inner-city Sydney sorting, wrapping and packing presents for Sydney's sick and underprivileged until his death last month.

One bedroom still sits half filled with carefully labelled boxes the bearded biker will not be able to deliver in person for the first time in 25 years. In the lounge room is his 'office' where Animal sat for hours preparing Christmas packages for hospital patients, local children and anyone who might otherwise go without a gift.

Randall 'Animal' Nelson, the 'Kings Cross Santa' has died, leaving behind a stockpile of Christmas gifts for the sick and underprivileged.

Biker Santa 'Animal' worked year-round in his tiny public housing unit preparing Christmas presents to give to hospital patients and inner-city children. 

Animal was a common sight riding around Sydney's inner-city on his trademark purple trike.

 'He had his own little Santa's workshop here,' said 'Chips', the president of the Kings Cross Bikers Social and Welfare Club, which Animal co-founded in 1989. And from here Animal coordinated the club's annual Christmas gift run for patients and staff at Darlinghurst's St Vincent's Hospital and Sacred Heart Hospice.

His death last month means the Kings Cross Santa's beloved biker brothers will have to make their first Christmas run without him on December 21, two days after Animal would have turned 76. 

Chips, who showed Daily Mail Australia around Animal's unit, said his mentor's Christmas cavern might look a little shabby like its former inhabitant but it was more cluttered than chaotic. 'He was extraordinarily organised,' he said. 

A place for everything and everything in its place:  Animal's own Santa's workshop was cluttered rather than chaotic.

Presents sit waiting to be delivered in the first Kings Cross Bikers Christmas run that Animal will miss.

 

Every gift box was carefully labelled by Animal in his own inner-city Santa's workshop.

 

Donated gifts destined for hospital patients and local children half fill Animal's 'spare room'.

On Animal's work bench are rolls of sticky tape, an ashtray and pink-handled scissors. Behind the desk is a printer and all around are neat stacks of wrapping paper, packets of ribbons and pinned-up detailed lists.  Every note he intended sending is signed 'Animal OAM'.

And just like that other Santa, Animal received stacks of correspondence, all of which he kept. 

On every wall are hung letters of thanks, commendations from charities and photographs of Animal with celebrities including singer Delta Goodrem, actor Georgie Parker and newsreader Jessica Rowe. Pictures show the biker with former governor-general Michael Jeffery, parliamentary speaker Bronwyn Bishop and retiring NSW governor Marie Bashir.

Former model and actor Kate Fischer was one of many celebrities to pose on the back of Animal's bike.

Dame Marie presented the former soldier and prison inmate with the Medal of the Order Australia for his community work a decade ago and often visited him in hospital in the months before his death.

A spokeswoman for Dame Marie told Daily Mail Australia before her retirement on Wednesday that 'the Governor will be attending Animal's funeral on Saturday'. She will be one of those to speak.

At Animal's OAM presentation ceremony at Government House in 2004, he shocked dignitaries by putting his arm around the governor and pecking her on the cheek. 'It's all right, I know her,' he told the other guests.  

Chips said Dame Marie and Animal subsequently often met at community events. 'Two people from two completely different worlds and they just hit it off,' he said. 'You could see it was a genuine friendship.' 

Retired governor Dame Marie Bashir presented Animal with a Medal of the Order Australia and regularly visited him in St Vincent's Hospital.

Animal had an affinity with everyone he enountered, young and old.

Reverend Bill Crews, who first met Animal at least 30 years ago, had no idea how many mourners to expect at the Wayside Chapel in inner-city Kings Cross. 'Look, a lot of the people he touched, their lives are quite disparate and all over the place,' he said. 'If they can get their act together, they'll be there.'

There will be drunks and junkies, prostitutes and politicians, and every other type of unorthodox misfit.

'It'll be an underclass version of a state funeral,' Rev Crews said.

Chips, who was with Animal when he died at the Sacred Heart Hospice on September 16, has followed Animal's instructions in organising the service. 'I haven't stopped in the last two weeks,' he said. A coffin painted with the Australian flag and draped with Animal's Kings Cross Bikers vest will arrive on a motorcycle side-car. Suzi Quatro's Devil Gate Drive will play during a slide show, followed by The Carnival Is Over by The Seekers. 

There will be a bagpiper at the Wayside Chapel and an army bugler at Eastern Suburbs Crematorium.

The Wayside's pastor Reverend Graham Long, who will conduct the service, said Animal had been as integral to Kings Cross as the suburb's famous El Alamein Fountain or the iconic neon Coca-Cola sign at the top of the red-light district's William Street.

‘Animal was one of the cornerstones of Kings Cross and was as much a part of the Cross as the Fountain,' Rev Long said. 'He could be seen - and heard - cruising around in his trike up and down the main strip.

'He had a knack of being there for people who were lost, elderly, homeless, addicted or down on their luck.

‘Animal could relate well to anyone and everyone. It's a bit like somebody took the Coke sign away. He will be sorely missed.'

The Motorcycle Council of NSW has donated $1000 towards the cost of the funeral. 'It's a tragic loss,' council spokesman Guy Stanford said. 'That guy did an enormous amount for some particularly unglamorous people.'

Rev Crews said: 'I just want to go because I loved him'.

'Put it this way, people who have got nothing will give you everything. And he was one of those. He'd give you everything .The world is a poorer place because a bikie like Animal has died. If a wealthy banker died, so what?'

The facts of Animal's early life are mysterious, even to his friends like Mr Stanford. 'He was a bit of an enigma in that sense,' he said. 

'He gave nothing away. He let people reach their own assumptions by just judging him by what they saw.

'It's the old story that actions speak far louder than any words. And just by his actions alone you can judge him as a good man.' 

Rev Bill Crews said of Animal: 'You could see his childhood written in his face'

 

Rev Crews believed Animal's early life 'wouldn't have been very good'. 'You could in a sense see his childhood written in his face,' he said.

Animal described his childhood as 'shithouse'. It is generally agreed he spent years in state-run homes in Victoria and left school as young as 12 to work as a jackaroo. There might have been a serious horse-riding accident. He appears to ridden a motorcycle into Sydney in 1956.

There was a stint in National Service and a couple of stints behind bars. Some media reports claim he has nine children. Close friends say they know of none. In 1989, along with fellow riders 'Steptoe' and 'Feral', he found the Kings Cross Bikers club. 

'Our club charter is clear,' Animal once said. 'We look after the elderly, we visit the jails, we counsel the sick and addicted...and we make sure no one gives their family up.'

Rev Long learnt not to ask Animal too much about himself. 'There are a lot of things about Animal you don't want to dig too deeply into,' he said. 'You don't know what you might find.

'Everything I've heard about his early life is disastrous. There is no redemption anywhere. There's a couple of things he's told me which I guess will go to my grave. 

'You wouldn't expect something so beautiful and heroic to some from somewhere as ugly as that.'

 Animal's funeral will be held at the Wayside Chapel in Hughes Street, Kings Cross, at 11am on Saturday.
