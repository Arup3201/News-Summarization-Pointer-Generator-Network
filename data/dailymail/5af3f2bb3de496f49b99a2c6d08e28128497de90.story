A 23-year-old man died of an apparent drug overdose on Wednesday after being found unconscious in the apartment bathtub of prominent New York hotel tycoon Ian Reisner. 

Mr Reisner, 46, called 911 around 8.21am to report that a man needed medical attention at his apartment at 230 Central Park South in Manhattan.

Paramedics rushed Sean Verdi of Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, to St Luke's Hospital where he was  pronounced dead at 9.03am.

A police source told the New York Daily News that Verdi's death appeared to be a drug overdose while friends claimed to the News that the young man had taken cocaine and molly. 

The medical examiner will give an official ruling after conducting an autopsy on Thursday.

Investigators also do not believe any criminality was involved. MailOnline was awaiting a response from the NYPD today.  

Mr Verdi's parents told the New York Post that their son met Mr Reisner at Bartini Ultra Lounge in the Hell's Kitchen district of Manhattan, where the 23-year-old worked, before he and a few other people went back to the property developer's luxury pad. 

His stepfather Steven Colandrea told the Post that Sean never had any problems and they were upset to find out how old Mr Reisner is. 

MailOnline had reached out to Mr Reisner for comment on Thursday. 

Last May, the 23-year-old graduated from Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, New Jersey with a degree in bioengineering this summer and belonged to the Sigma Nu fraternity.

Verdi's social media revealed his love of being part of a college fraternity and a number of references to partying in New York, Vermont and Florida.

Reisner is the co-founder of Parkview Developers, which builds hotels and apartment buildings throughout Manhattan. 

He started the company in 2003 with business partner Mati Weiderpass. Together they started the gay hotel OUT NYC in Hell's Kitchen.

He previously worked on Wall Street for 15 years with Salomon Brothers and then Bank of America.

According to real estate blog, The Real Deal,  Reisner lives in a 4,000-sq-ft apartment which was created by combining five apartments in Southmoor House at 230 Central Park South.

The duplex spreads over the 16th and 17th floors and has views of Central Park. The apartment has four bedrooms, six bathrooms and space to throw parties for 100 people.

Reisner and Mr Weiderpass once turned down an offer of $15.5million in cash for the luxury home.  

'Give me an excuse and I’ll throw a party,' Reisner said in the 2009 interview.  

Reisner was arrested on a drug-related charge earlier this year close to his family's home in Water Mill in the Hamptons. 

He was arrested in East Hampton in May after allegedly fleeing the scene of an accident while under the influence of drugs, the East Hampton Star reported.

Local authorities charged him with misdemeanor DWI and he was released on $500 bail.
