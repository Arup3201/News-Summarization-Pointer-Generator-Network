MPs have called for an urgent crackdown on foreign students who abuse the immigration system as figures show barely one in 1,000 suspected cases ends  in deportation.

Universities reported a record 106,000 cases of suspected abuse by foreign students last year, following pressure to clamp down on bogus applications from those looking to come to Britain to work.

But Home Office figures reveal the UK Border Agency took action over just 658 individuals. Of these, 153 cases – fewer than a quarter – ended in the suspect being deported.

The figures, released under the Freedom of Information Act, suggest just 0.14 per cent of cases lead to deportation.

They will fuel criticism of the UKBA, which is set to be broken up following a warning from Home Secretary Theresa May that its performance is ‘not good enough’.

James Clappison, a Tory member of the Commons home affairs committee, said the apparently lax enforcement risked undermining Government efforts to crack down on bogus students.

Mr Clappison said: ‘It is extremely important that the UK Border Agency take this issue seriously, and thoroughly investigate where there are concerns.

Sir Andrew Green of Migration Watch said that the figures showed the scale of the abuse of the British education system

‘These figures suggest the 
performance is nowhere near good enough. On the face of it they are 
looking into far too few cases and that is a serious matter because we 
can’t afford to have any holes in our system of immigration control.’

Rules introduced in 2009 mean non-EU 
students must be sponsored by a licensed college or university, which 
must report any concerns to UKBA.

In the academic year 2011/12 colleges reported 106,698 warnings to UKBA – up from 77,757 the previous year and 4,795 in the first year of the scheme.

Andrew Green, chairman of the think-tank Migration Watch UK, said the figures provided ‘astonishing evidence of the sheer scale of abuse of the British education system by foreign students’.

In May last year the UKBA launched Operation Rosehip to deport those who had breached or overstayed their visas. But the latest figures suggest the initiative produced only modest results.

A report last year accused UKBA of ignoring tens of thousands of alerts from colleges, potentially allowing huge numbers to remain in the country on false pretences.

Of the 190,000 warnings since the system began, more than 70,000 involved reports of a significant change in a student’s circumstances, 52,000 related to the college ending its visa sponsorship of the student, and almost 17,000 said a student had finished or dropped out of their course.

Other significant reasons included more than 32,000 reports of students failing to register for their courses on time and more than 1,700 reports students may have breached the conditions of their leave to remain in the UK.

Home Office sources yesterday stressed the rules require colleges to report a wide range of concerns, from the serious to the relatively innocuous.

They also insisted hundreds of bogus colleges have been shut down in a bid to prevent people using further education as a backdoor route into Britain. Since 2009 more than 800 bogus colleges have been stripped of their licences.

A Home Office spokesman said: ‘Our education system is one of the best in the world.

‘We have overhauled the student visa regime to tackle abuse and figures show our changes are having the right effect. More university students are coming here and bogus students are being kept out.’
