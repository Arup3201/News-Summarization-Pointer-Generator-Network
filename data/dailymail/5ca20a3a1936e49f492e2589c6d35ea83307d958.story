If you wanted to wander lonely as a cloud yesterday, this was definitely not the place to be.

For as the sun finally came out at the end of a drizzly bank holiday weekend, hundreds of climbers made a scramble for the summit of Snowdon.

Queues snaked all the way down the 3,560ft mountain as hordes of hikers waited patiently to reach its peak.

Ramblers sat perched along the

avoided queues – and the seven hours it takes to climb up and down again
– by taking a train to the top.

More
than 10 million people visit the Snowdonia National Park each year, 
while 350,000 make it to Snowdon’s peak. It is climbed by more people 
than any other British mountain.

Temperatures
on the slopes can reach 30C in summer and plummet to -20C in winter and
around 200 inches of rain fall there each year.

But
yesterday there were no such showers to dampen the crowd’s spirits. 
Sunshine and blue skies graced the country yesterday, just in time to 
save the bank holiday weekend from being a washout.

Three day forecast: The weather is expected to be bright and warm for most places for the middle of this week, with temperatures up to 25C

Thousands of people making the most of the fine weather after last week’s showers headed to the seaside at Bournemouth, Dorset.

The
roads were packed and car parks filled up early in the morning as 
sunseekers attempted to get a good spot on the seven-mile stretch of 
golden sand.

Despite temperatures failing to rival the sweltering heat 
recorded last month, the clear skies came as a relief to many  who 
suffered a weekend of heavy showers.

Torrential
rain on Saturday resulted in flooding on roads across the country. 
Parts of Essex were particularly badly affected, with many homes and 
businesses damaged.

Although
the sun is forecast to last for the rest of the week, temperatures are 
expected to drop slightly to the averages expected for this time of 
year. The Met Office’s Simon Partridge said: ‘By the end of the week 
temperatures will be in their high teens and low twenties.

‘Today
they should be in the mid-twenties in the south and the low twenties 
the further west you go … Towards the end of the week it will be dry, 
with normal temperatures for this time of year.’

Today
is expected to be as pleasant as yesterday and more sunshine is 
forecast for the four-day week, bringing the kids’ summer holidays to a 
dry end.

The boat was bought by Scarborough and Whitby Conservative MP Robert Goodwill in 2011

Mr Partridge 
added: ‘There will be more in the way of light rain in north-west 
England and west Scotland this morning.

'The rest of the country will 
probably wake up to some resting fog and some low cloud, very much like 
they did yesterday morning.

‘Generally
there will be more in the way of cloud towards the west with some light
patchy rain with more in the way of cloud in the far south-west and 
Cornwall area. But the rest of the country will be generally quite dry 
with some sunny spells.

‘For
the rest of the week … the high pressure which is building to the south
of the UK should help keep it sunny and dry. In the far north and west 
it is more likely that you are going to see some bands of cloud and rain
– reasonably light bands.’
