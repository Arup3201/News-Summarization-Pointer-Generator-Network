UKIP is on course to crush the Conservatives in the Rochester and Strood by-election, according to a new poll last night.

The Survation poll for the Unite trade union gave Ukip candidate Mark Reckless a 15-point lead over his former party.

The lead has widened by six points since an identical poll last month, and suggests that a huge Tory effort to hold the seat is failing to gain traction.

The poll puts support for Ukip on 48 per cent, with the Conservatives on 33, Labour, who came second in 2010, on 16 per cent, the Greens on two percent and the Lib Dems on just one per cent.

Ukip’s vote has risen by eight points since last month, while the Tories and Lib Dems have both fallen by two points and Labour’s support has slumped by nine.

The development is a serious setback to David Cameron, who has pledged to ‘throw the kitchen sink’ at the attempt to hold the seat, in a bid to halt the Ukip surge.

It comes amid warnings that the Prime Minister could face a leadership challenge if the Conservatives fail to win.

Former leadership contender David Davis was yesterday reported to be taking soundings about a possible plot to depose Mr Cameron if the seat is lost.

Mr Davis, who could not be contacted for comment yesterday, is said to have told fellow MPs that there is a ‘window’ of opportunity to organise a vote of no confidence in Mr Cameron between the 20 November by-election and Christmas, if rebels act quickly.

Mr Cameron yesterday tried to steady the ship by summoning his MPs to an away day in Oxfordshire to discuss how to get back on the front foot.

MPs were told that George Osborne plans to use next month’s Autumn Statement to ram home the Tories successful record on the NHS.

And Tory strategist Lynton Crosby told MPs that the party could still win next year because of Ed Miliband’s unpopularity.

But one MP who stayed away, warned that the Tory leadership was underestimating the threat posed by the current situation. ‘I didn’t go, because I thought I was better off putting in a day’s campaigning. The message is always the same – Labour are so hopeless that we are going to somehow pull things out of the fire. It’s just like 1996.’

The Prime Minister was rocked earlier last month by the Clacton by-election, where Tory defector Douglas Carswell crushed his former party to become Ukip’s first elected MP.

A second defeat by Ukip would be a body blow to Mr Cameron just six months out from the General Election.

Ukip leader Nigel Farage is predicting that more MPs will defect to the anti-EU party if Mr Reckless wins, sparking further debilitating by-elections.

Mr Reckless enraged the Tory leadership when he defected to Ukip on the eve of the Conservative Party conference.

Senior Tories were initially confident they could hold the seat, and Tory MPs were ordered to campaign in the Kent constituency at least five times.

At the 2010 election Mr Reckless took Rochester and Strood for the Conservatives with a majority of almost 10,000 over Labour. Ukip did not stand in the seat last time.

Tory sources acknowledge they have flooded the constituency with leaflets since Mr Reckless quit. This has included a personal letter from Mr Cameron to every home in the constituency inviting voters to take part in an ‘open primary’ election to select Tory candidate Kelly Tolhurst.

But Ukip has also piled huge resources into the fight and appears to be picking up votes from across the political spectrum.
