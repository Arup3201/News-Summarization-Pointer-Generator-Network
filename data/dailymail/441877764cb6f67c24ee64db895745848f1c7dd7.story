Michael Deighton, 19, from Walker, Newcastle, is awaiting sentencing after admitting harassment after he was dumped by girlfriend Sophie Bruce

An obsessive teenager constantly texted his girlfriend asking where she was and who she was with, demanding she send him photographs of herself to prove it, a court heard.

Michael Deighton, 19, was eventually dumped by girlfriend Sophie Bruce, 18, after he demanded she delete all her male friends from Facebook, but he then turned stalker, following her to work and onto the bus, Newcastle magistrates were told.

The teenager, from Walker, Newcastle, is now awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty to harassment at the city's magistrates' court.

Prosecutor Veronica Jordan told JPs how Deighton became possessive of his girlfriend not long after they got together.

'At first she would say the relationship was fine but it was not long before the defendant became controlling and jealous,' she said. 

'He was constantly texting her, asking her where she was and who she was with, and asking her to take photographs of where she was.

'As the relationship progressed, he asked her to delete all her male friends from Facebook, and he would contact friends and tell them lies about her.'

When Miss Bruce ended the romance, Deighton began sending her abusive texts, followed her home, and began lurking near her house, the court heard.

'He threatened to ruin her life and visited her place of work attempting to get her sacked,' Mrs Jordan continued. 

'On that day after work she got on the bus home and he was sitting on a seat. She gets off the bus and he follows her, threatening her, saying she'd better pass on her passwords for Facebook so they could "always be together". 

'She was petrified he could be anywhere, waiting for her.'

When Deighton was arrested, police spoke to his mother who told them he had borrowed her phone and sent 73 text messages to Miss Bruce in the space of 20 minutes.

Charles Weidner, defending, told magistrates that Deighton's behaviour was a sign of his immaturity.

He said: 'He fully accepts the relationship is at an end. This experience hasn't been pleasant for him.

'It's a lesson for him - it's something he is going to have to understand if he's going to have further relationships.'

Magistrates adjourned the case and Deighton will be sentenced after pre-sentence reports have been prepared.
