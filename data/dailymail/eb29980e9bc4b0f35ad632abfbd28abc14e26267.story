Planes full of passengers could be ‘left on runways’ as airports struggle to cope during the Olympic Games, senior MPs have warned.

The House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee said London Heathrow could become gridlocked, with planes forced to circle the airport and tourists made to queue at passport control for several hours.

In a leaked letter to Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt, MPs claim cuts to UK Border Agency staff and poor contingency plans could be a recipe for disaster during the London 2012 Games.

Jammed: The House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee said London Heathrow could become gridlocked, with planes forced to circle the airport and tourists made to queue at passport control for several hours

They said Heathrow operator BAA had 
not allowed any more time in the plane schedule to unload hundreds of 
thousands of extra passengers.

As many as 600,000 are expected to arrive at Heathrow around the time of the Games, which run from July 27 to August 12.

In
a stark warning, committee chairman John Whittingdale wrote: ‘While 
visiting tourists will understand that the Olympics is a busy time, if 
the wait (at immigration) is in excess of an hour it may deter tourists 
from returning.

‘The 
second impact may be that planes cannot unload their passengers into the
terminal due to capacity being exceeded. This would lead to circling in
the air, planes being left on runways or planes blocking gates.’

Mr
Whittingdale said two of his committee’s members, Therese Coffey and 
Gerry Sutcliffe, had attended a briefing by BAA concerning the company’s
preparations for London 2012.

Mr Whittingdale said two of his committee’s members, Therese Coffey and Gerry Sutcliffe, had attended a briefing by BAA concerning the company’s preparations for London 2012.

However, far from being reassured, 
they ‘did not leave the briefing confident that Heathrow was ready to 
cope with the arrival of a huge number of competitors, Olympic family 
and visiting tourists in timely fashion’.

Mr
Whittingdale added: ‘We understand that significant preparations have 
been made to accommodate unusual sporting equipment, special lanes for 
the Olympic family, welcoming arrangements for competitors and 
additional Olympic ambassadors.

‘However, far less thought seems to have been given to the issue of how to deal with long queues at immigration.

‘The UKBA representative suggested that there was insufficient funding to ensure all passport stations would be open.’

But while inadequate staffing could result in longer queues for tourists, the ‘Olympic family’ will be whisked through passport control in dedicated lanes.

Queues: As many as 600,000 are expected to arrive at Heathrow around the time of the Games, which run from July 27 to August 12

Earlier this year, the Mail revealed that more than 25,000 athletes, coaches and officials will be fast-tracked through the airport and thousands of immigration staff will be transferred from their normal duties to deal with the London 2012 VIPs.

In a document seen by the Mail, officials warn: ‘Dedicated lanes and the time taken to collect the biometrics of GFM (Games family members) may result in delays to non-Olympic passenger journeys.’

British Airways, bmi, easyJet and Virgin Atlantic have also warned that ‘urgent action’ is needed to prevent chaos at airports during the Games.

They said security measures, staff shortages and the sheer volume of unscheduled flights and business jets could cause severe delays for passengers during the summer.

A Border Force spokesman said: ‘We are well prepared for the Olympics, with additional staff available for busy periods.

‘But we will not compromise on border security and are working with BAA to ensure we are ready to deal with extra passengers.’
