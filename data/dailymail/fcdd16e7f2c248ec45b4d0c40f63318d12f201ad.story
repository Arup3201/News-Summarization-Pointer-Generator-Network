Plans: Douglas Alexander, the party's election co-ordinator, said the current system was 'simply not working'

Labour will pledge in its next manifesto to scrap £9,000-a-year tuition fees and introduce a new system with lower charges.

Douglas Alexander, the party’s election co-ordinator, said the current system was ‘simply not working’ and would be axed under a Labour government.

Party leader Ed Miliband unveiled plans to cut student fees to £6,000-a-year in his speech to the 2011 party conference but stopped short of making it a manifesto pledge.

Now Mr Alexander, also the shadow foreign secretary, has disclosed that tuition fees policy will be ‘addressed’ in the party’s next manifesto.

Plans being considered would reduce the maximum fee to £6,000-a-year through taxes on banks and the wealthiest graduates paying a higher interest rate on their student loans.

A more radical proposal put forward by John Denham, a universities minister in the last government, would reduce fees further, to £4,000-a-year.

A third option would involve scrapping tuition fees altogether and replacing them with a graduate tax.

The Tories claimed that cutting fees would leave Labour with a huge university funding ‘black hole’.

Labour’s plans emerged amid a growing row over the cost to the public purse of the system of £9,000-a-year fees and loans introduced by the Coalition in 2012.

Ministers originally believed that only 28 per cent of student loans would never be repaid but new calculations put the figure at 45 per cent.

Experts say that when the figure reaches 48 per cent, the new system will cost taxpayers more than the one it replaced.

Questioned about tuition fees on BBC One’s Andrew Marr Show, Mr Alexander said: ‘This seems to be another Con/Dem policy that simply is not working. The rate of default emerged this week and it’s very high.

‘Ed Miliband has gone on the record in 
the past in saying this is a policy that we are looking at. I expect it 
is a policy that we will address in our manifesto and I hope that we are
 able to offer a better solution to the students of this country and to 
the finances of this country than that which we have seen from the 
Conservatives.’

Plans: Ed Miliband outlined proposals to scrap the current system during the Labour party conference in 2011 while higher education spokesman Liam Byrne has also backed reform

Asked if Labour could simply get rid of the fees, he said: ‘We are dealing with this as part of our policy review process, I expect it’s an issue we will address in our manifesto but it’s very clear that even on the Government’s own evidence this is not a policy that’s working.’

Defence: Universities Minister David Willetts said: 'A graduate repayment system is the only sustainable way of financing higher education'

One plan expected to put forward by Mr Denham this week would see students given an ‘entitlement’ of £15,000 they could take to any university - or £5,000-a-year for a typical three-year degree.

Universities would be able to charge more - up to around £4,000-a-year - if the costs of teaching exceeded the value of the entitlement.

Meanwhile Liam Byrne, Labour’s higher education spokesman, has revealed the party is considering reform in two stages - first a cut to fees and then a graduate tax.

‘What we’ll have to do in our manifesto is take our starting point of £6k fees, explain how we see the situation for 2015 to 2020, and how we’ll see a long-term shift to a graduate tax,’ he said in a recent interview.

Defending the current system, Universities Minister David Willetts said: ‘A graduate repayment system is the only sustainable way of financing higher education.

‘The question for Labour is that if they want to cut fees by £3,000 they will have a black hole of £3billion.’

The Conservatives are reportedly considering a range of measures to reduce the student loans bill including stripping some lower-ranked universities of their right to charge tuition fees if drop-out rates from courses are too high or graduates struggle to find graduate-level jobs.

But elite universities would be able to raise fees above £9,000-a-year if they could show that their courses led to high-earning jobs which would allow student loans to be paid back in full.

A further proposal reportedly being considered by the Treasury would involve imposing a minimum qualification for students to go to university, reducing the numbers in the system.
