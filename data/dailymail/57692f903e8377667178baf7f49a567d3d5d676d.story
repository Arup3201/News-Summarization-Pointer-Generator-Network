Police say he had been a person of interest in the case since Ms Jeffery's body was found  by the Macintyre River in the Queensland-NSW border town of Goondiwindi on March 16.

Sergeant David Isherwood, Regional Crime Coordinator of South-East Queensland, told MailOnline there was 'sufficient forensic evidence for him to be put for the courts'.

Police said Trebeck had left Goondiwindi when CCTV footage emerged of a man they believe to be him following Ms Jeffrey through town in March, Nine News reports.

Ms Jeffrey was seen throwing her hands in the air before the man tried to put his arm around her as they walked out of the camera frame.

She had been at a nearby pub during the night before she started walking home.

Former pro-boxer Daniel Rowsell, whose car was spotted in the CCTV footage, told A Current Affair he tried to offer Ms Jeffrey money for a taxi after she left the pub.

‘(Trebeck) came over to the car and said “she doesn’t want your money. She’s pretty hard to get, I’ve been tuning her on Facebook”,’ Mr Rowsell said.

Trebeck, who lives in Bluewater near Townsville, will appear in the Proserpine Magistrates Court on Monday.
