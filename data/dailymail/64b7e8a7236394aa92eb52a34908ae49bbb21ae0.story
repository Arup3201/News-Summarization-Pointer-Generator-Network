Lukas Podolski would love to see England end their 50-year wait for a major title at Euro 2016.

The Arsenal forward, who is currently on loan at Inter Milan, would pick England were he to choose a winner in France at a tournament he says will be his last for Germany.

'They love and live for football,' he told Germany's Bild newspaper. 'It's fantastic to play football there.

'I would not begrudge the Brits the title. They would deserve it.'

Podolski already knows the feeling of winning a major tournament having lifted the World Cup with Germany in the summer, but the 29-year-old says he will not be defending that title in Russia.

'I've already achieved my biggest goal of winning the World Cup and nobody can take that from me now.

'The European Championship will be the last major tournament for me. There are another three years to the next World Cup.'

During that time, Podolski wants to focus on getting back to his best form with the regular football he is finally being given in Serie A.

'When I've found my rhythm again, then I'm convinced I can help the team,' he added.

'Our aim is to qualify for the Champions League, but that's going to be a difficult challenge.'

Inter lie ninth in Serie A at the midway stage of the season, seven points behind third-placed Napoli and a qualifying berth for the Champions League.

Podolski has already played four times for Roberto Mancini's men, although he has yet to open his account for the club.
