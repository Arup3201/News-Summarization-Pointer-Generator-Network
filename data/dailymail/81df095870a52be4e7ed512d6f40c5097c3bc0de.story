Your pet may enjoy exploring your neighbourhood, but after it dies, it could go on the ultimate adventure in space and even set paw on the moon.

The world’s ‘most unique pet memorial service in the universe’ lets owners launch their pets’ ashes into orbit and even deep space aboard spacecraft, as soon as this autumn.

The new service has four service options, which start at $995 (£590). While some people may assume that owners would be barking mad to shell out for such a lavish memorial, the company, Celestis Pets, claims the missions are one way to ‘honour our animal companions’.

The incredible journey: The world's 'most unique pet memorial service in the universe' (illustrated) lets owners launch their pets' ashes into orbit and even deep space aboard spacecraft as soon as this autumn. There are four options ranging from orbiting the Earth to journeying into deep space

‘Your best friend was an explorer in life. With Celestis Pets, they can travel forever in the stars,’ the company says.

Since 1995 Houston-based Celestis has conducted memorial spacecrafts carrying human remains to the moon and letting them drift through space, but the pet service is a new addition, which the firm says has been requested by owners of beloved animals.

Owners can choose from four spaceflight options, the cheapest of which is the Earth Rise service, at $995.

Homeward bound: The Earth orbit Service launches remains into Earth's orbit where they vapourise 'like a shooting star'

This option will see a ‘symbolic portion’ of cremated remains go to space and after ‘experiencing the zero gravity environment,’ return to Earth. The capsule will even be returned to the pet’s family.

While it may be easy to imagine an urn zooming through space, the ‘portion’ refers to approximately one gram of ashes or a lock of the pet’s hair.

The pricier Earth Orbit Service costs from $4,995 (£2,961) and launches pets’ remains into space aboard a ‘real space mission alongside a commercial satellite.

It will be placed in Earth orbit where it will stay before re-entering the atmosphere, vapourising like a shooting star ‘as a final tribute’.

A Luna service, starting at $12,500 (£7,410) could leave the ashes of a pet on the moon, while the Voyager Service at the same price, could see a pet journey through the stars into deep space ‘to explore places they could only have dreamed of in life’.

The company goes so far as to say that a spacecraft memorial could ‘meanfully contribute to the future life on Earth’.

‘Every Celestis Pets mission is part of a rapidly growing space industry and gives us valuable knowledge about space travel, our universe and perhaps one day the origins of life on Earth,’ the website says.

Star gazing: A Luna service, starting at $12,500 ($7,400) could leave the ashes of a pet on the moon, while the Voyager Service at the same price, could see a pet journey through the stars into deep space 'to explore places they could only have dreamed of in life,' the company said

Earth Rise: The service launches ‘a symbolic portion of cremated remains’ into space and after experiencing the zero gravity environment, returns the individual flight capsules back to Earth.The capsules are recovered and the remains returned to the pets' owners. It costs from $995 (£590).

Earth Orbit: Costing from $4,995 (£2,961) the ashes travel aboard a spacecraft on a ‘real space mission’ alongside a satellite. It orbits the Earth before re-entering the atmosphere where it vaporises ‘like a shooting star in final tribute’.

Luna: The service takes pets’ cremated remains to the moon from $12,500 (£7,410). Celestis first offered this service to humans in 1999 when it received a request from Nasa to assist the family of Dr Eugene Shoemaker to leave some of this ashes aboard the Nasa Lunar Prospector mission.

Voyager: The ultimate pet adventurer can take a tour of deep space from $12,500 (£7,410). Ashes will be places aboard a craft that leaves the Earth-moon system on a permanent celestial journey.

The next missions will embark in autumn this year.
