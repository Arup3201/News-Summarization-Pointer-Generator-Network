It seems everyone is jumping on the virtual reality bandwagon - from Sony to Microsoft to, more surprisingly, Facebook.

The main problem with the technology, however, is its price. To solve this, a Polish firm has developed a cheap headset that takes advantage of the technology found in everyday phones.

Called Vrizzmo, it uses rounded lenses and apps to show 3D images, and head movements are tracked using the phone’s built-in gyroscope.

The Vrizzmo headset, pictured, was unveiled at Poland's Digital Dragons by makers De JET Works. It consists of straps and a plastic case for phones with 4.7-inch screens or larger. The phone is strapped in front of the wearer's face and rounded lenses separate the display to appear in front of each eye, causing a 3D effect

Variations of virtual reality have been around for years, in particular in flight and driving simulators, but it's popularity has risen recently due to companies such as Oculus VR.

Its Oculus Rift headset began life as a 
Kickstarter project and was bought by Facebook earlier this year in a 
deal said to be worth around $2 billion. A consumer version is expected later this year.

Sony announced its own headset, under Project Morpheus, in March.

The
 adjustable device features a head-mounted display with 1080p HD 
resolution and a 90-degree field of view, while sensors built into the 
headset track head movements.

In April, Microsoft bought smart glasses specialist Osterhout Design Group and rumours suggest its working on its own augmented and virtual reality gadget for players of its Xbox One.

The harness was developed by De JET Works, which recently demonstrated the technology at Poland’s Digital Dragons event.

While development kits for one of the most well-known headsets, Oculus Rift, start at $350 (€254 or £207), the Vrizzmo is expected to retail for just €50 ($68 or £40).

The Vrizzmo headset consists of rubber straps and a plastic case for phones with 4.7-inch screens or larger.

The phone is strapped in front of the wearer’s face and rounded lenses separate the display to appear in front of each eye.

Apps show each eye different versions of the same image to create 3D, stereoscopic effect.

This effect, as well as any potential lag, then depends on the quality of the phone’s processor, accelerometer and gyroscope.

De JET Works said it is hoping to officially launch the device ‘later this summer’, but a developer kit could be released as early as next month.

It is also working on a series of games 
including a zombie shooter currently being used during demonstrations. Others include a flying, and racing game. 

Samsung could be about to enter the virtual reality race, if reports about an upcoming headset are true. The Korean firm is said to have sent early prototypes to developers to test, and the final product could launch by the end of the year. It would rival Sony's Project Morpheus headset, pictured

In April, Microsoft bought smart glasses specialist Osterhout Design Group for $150 million (£88 million).

Rumours suggest it is working on its own augmented and virtual reality gadget, called Neo VR, for players of its Xbox One.

Samsung was one of the first major companies to launch a smartwatch, after Sony, and is among the pioneers of the curved TV screen industry. Samsung could be hoping to steal a charge against its rivals, including Facebook's Oculus Rift, pictured, and be the first to sell its virtual reality headset to customers
