Coming soon to a plane near you – the mobile phone call.

For years, aircraft in flight have – with the exception of Tube carriages and funerals – been a final refuge from the invasive reach of the cellphone conversation.

But this state of affairs could be set to change.

Last week, the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) published new guidance for airlines which lifted restrictions on the use of mobile devices during flight.

Oh great, it's the boss: Being able to access your mobile on planes means the office can always contact you 

And with discussions about a similar relaxation of the rules taking place in the US, the era of having to switch off your phone before take-off – or risk the infinite wrath of that oddly furious air stewardess – could be coming to an end.

Will this be a good and wonderful thing – another breezy victory for technology as the age of information marches unstoppably onwards? Or just an extra irritating factor bolted on to the already-really-quite-irritating experience that is air travel in the 21st century?

We can think of a few reasons why it may be the former.

And lots of reasons why it may be the latter.

Ten reasons why mobile phones on planes will be A Bad Thing

(1) The ‘I’m on a plane’ conversation

At a rough estimate (ie, I’ve just made this figure up), nine out of ten conversations made on mobile phones are completely unnecessary. Useful things and Words Of Great Import are rarely spoken on cellphones. They are the white noise of modern life. Bursts of static.

So bear in mind that almost every phone call conducted on a plane will go something like the below. Then bear in mind how annoying this will be if you are sitting in the next seat.

Ring ring.

Person calling: Hi Dave/Steve/Sarah/Kim, how are you?

Dave/Steve/Sarah/Kim: I’m good. I’m on a plane right now.

Person calling: Oh, OK. Some other question that could definitely wait for a better time.

Dave/Steve/Sarah/Kim: Not now, no. I’m on a plane.

Repeat three million times on your flight alone.

Crackle crackle: You may be able to talk on your phone soon - but will you be able to hear the other person?

(2) The quality of the line

Despite great advances in communications technology, there are frequently occasions when you can be walking in the middle of London, Paris or New York, and still receive a call where all you can hear down the line is what sounds like a double-decker bus reversing over glass, 200 seagulls having a fight over a biscuit, or a cat let loose on yesterday’s newspaper.

Will the quality of the line be any better when you are not standing at the heart of a major metropolis, but 36,000ft above Alaska, in a reinforced metal tube? We’re guessing ‘no’.

(3) No rest for the wicked

If there is one thing that the lengthy international flight has in its favour in the 21st century, it is the fact that, for eight or so hours, you are gloriously unobtainable.

And with the rest of the world on pause, you can sink back into your seat (or sit bolt upright in it, if you are flying in economy), drink a glass of cheap teeth-staining red wine, and watch whatever ‘comedy’ Vince Vaughn has put his name to this month. Yeah, Owen Wilson is in it too.

But what’s this? If mobile phones are allowed on board, your e-mails will be permitted too.

And suddenly, your boss wants you to download that attachment about maximising performance figures, blah blah, something about revenue, blah blah, Office Hawaiian Shirt Day on Friday. Goodbye Vince and Owen. Hello that endless pile of paperwork.

'Hello, I'm on the plane': Will the use of phones on aircraft merely make other passengers even more irritating?

(4) Ringtones in the night

There are many things which can be classified as ‘all but impossible’: Running the 100 Metres in less than five seconds. Climbing Everest with no arms. Watching 10 minutes of The X Factor without some weeping tone-deaf idiot from Crewe declaring that ‘this is all I want to do, and I’ll give it one million per cent.’ The very idea of ‘one million per cent’.

You can add to this list: ‘Getting any sort of viable sleep in an economy class seat’.

But just imagine, for one brief, glorious second, that you have dropped off on your way back across the Atlantic. You are having a nice dream about chocolate, or kittens, or Jennifer Lawrence. And then someone’s phone starts ringing in a bag in the overhead locker above you. And that no-one gets up to answer it. Not even when it rings for the fifth time.

Now it is not nice to want to throw someone from a moving plane. But in certain situations…

(5) The queue for the loo just got longer

So you want to have a private phone conversation, even though you are in the middle of a plane cabin, where just the 200 random acquaintances can hear your every word. Where can you go to say ‘goodnight squeegee-weegy snuggleboo, I wuv you too’ to your nearest and dearest without an entire aircraft guffawing? Why has the toilet been in use all flight?

(6) The guy in front’s voice

In the event that someone does decide to have a full phone conversation while in listening range of 200 strangers, you can guarantee that their voice will not be one that sings blissful melodies on chill-out albums, or features on adverts for spa weekends or luxury toilet paper.

It will be the nasal equivalent of a small hand drill being used on a blackboard, or 30,000 mosquitos having a ‘who has the highest whine’ competition inside your ear.

Oh great, the guy in Seat 44B is going to play games for the next eight hours. Isn't technology wonderful?

(7) A billion bad photos

The advent of the smartphone has freed us all from the evil clutches of old-fashioned cameras and the tyranny of proper photography, and liberated us to take images of whatever we want, whenever we want. Particularly if it’s a red-eyed selfie, a rubbish snap of a plate of dinner, or a blurry picture of a cat hilariously being asleep, or something.

Just imagine the wealth of visual brilliance that will flood social media when we are all allowed to take photos from two miles above the earth’s surface, and post them online IMMEDIATELY? Is it Greenland? Is that the Atlantic Ocean, or is it the back of the seat in front? Did you have your finger over the lens on that one? #absolutelynobodycares

(8) It won’t be cheap

For mobile phones to work properly in transit, airlines will have to install extra technology on their planes. Will they do this out of the goodness of their profit margins – or will the additional cost be added discreetly to your next ticket? Don’t answer that.

And just wait until your service provider – never shy of foisting an extra lump sum onto your bill because you downloaded one photo while in France – works out that you’ve been chatting in the air. Hello Mr Bank Manager, I’d like to discuss a second mortgage.

(9) Random requests

You know how blood-boilingly annoyed you get when somebody in the office goes around asking if ‘anyone has a charger for an iPhone 6’, because he’s already lost his, despite the phone only being released 10 minutes ago. And then doesn’t return yours.

That. At 36,000ft.

Disaster averted: For years, we've been told that this is what will happen if we use our mobiles while in the air

(10) It means the airlines have been lying to us all this time

For the last decade or so, the rhetoric has been simple – we have to put away our phones during flights because they may interfere with the plane’s communication systems.

With this has come the unspoken threat – ‘switch off your phone immediately or this aircraft will – instantly and irreversibly – spiral downwards into the ground, killing all of us on board. And you, and you alone, Man On Phone in Seat 9B, will be responsible for this.’

Turns out this wasn’t the case. Who knew?

Three reasons why mobile phones on planes will be A Good Thing

Noah: A good reason to make a phone call to anyone

(1) Proper arrival times

No more will your long-suffering partner have to hang around an airport on the basis that you might arrive at some point in the next four hours.

A simple ‘darling, we’re in an eternal queue above JFK, get another coffee’ will at least reveal where the hell you are.

(2) No more nasty surprises

Few things are more worrying than the clang-clang of five ‘missed call’ text messages when you return to terra firma.

What’s happened? Have I been fired? Are you divorcing me? Is the dog dead?

Now, at least you will know of Mr Chuckle's tragic departure to the kennel in the sky in good time.

(3) They will save us all from the thorny issue of bad movies

Last month, I watched almost half an hour – about 27 minutes, I think – of Noah, starring Russell Crowe, on a transatlantic flight.

Had I been able to use my phone, I would have been spared this horror.

However, phones on planes may not be universally greeted as a good idea
