Undercover: The MI5 agent pictured during a terror trial in Brussels in 2003

An MI5 agent who infiltrated terrorist cells and worked on the investigation into the 7/7 bombings has been granted police protection after becoming the target of death threats by Islamic extremists in Britain.

The 33-year-old Moroccan-born undercover agent worked for MI5 for six years – risking his life to  prevent terror attacks on the UK.

Despite this, the Government has refused to allow him to stay indefinitely in Britain. 

But now it has emerged that his 
identity has been compromised and Islamic extremists in the UK have made
 death threats against him.

One
 threat was made by someone in a prison and another by extremists 
meeting at a Central London shisha bar.

Scotland Yard has installed a 
panic button in the man’s home and officers patrol the streets outside.

There are plans to move him to a secret address and the security bill could reach £50,000 a year.

The
 agent infiltrated Islamic extremist cells, worked on the investigations
 into the 7/7 bus and Tube attacks on London and the Madrid train 
bombings as well as providing vital intelligence which led to the arrest
 of Al Qaeda suspects.

His vital work was praised by Tony Blair.

But
 after leaving MI5 in 2006, he has had to live a double life, unable to 
tell anyone about his work with the Security Service.

And although he has lived in the UK since 1999, the Home Office has refused to grant him a permanent right to remain in the UK.

The man claims this has made it harder for him to lead a new life away from the scrutiny of extremists.

The
 Mail on Sunday can also reveal that his case is being investigated by 
the Investigatory Powers Tribunal which holds the security and 
intelligence services to account.

The
 investigation will look at whether MI5 broke the law when they 
recruited the man and whether they failed to protect him after he 
stopped working for them.

He
 also has a case before the immigration tribunal, which will review the 
Home Secretary’s decision not to grant him the permanent right to remain
 in the UK.

In a second case, he is suing the Government for breaches of its duty of care.

The
 man, who married a British citizen with whom he has a five-year-old 
daughter, left Morocco when he was 15 and arrived in the UK three years 
later after travelling across Europe.

He
 stayed at the Finsbury Park Mosque where he met radical preacher Abu 
Hamza, whose followers sent him to Georgia and then Chechnya.

According
 to legal papers seen by The Mail on Sunday, he says that when he 
returned to the UK in 2000 he was approached by MI5 and recruited.

In December 2001, he was sent to Belgium to infiltrate an extremist 
cell but was  arrested and held for two years in solitary confinement 
without charge.

In January 
2004, he claims he was visited by an MI5 officer who told him that then 
Home Secretary David Blunkett had authorised his transfer to the UK.

He
 says he was offered the choice of remaining in prison in Belgium, 
returning to Morocco where he claims he faced arrest and torture, or 
continuing his work with MI5.

He
 was then sent to a house in Swansea where he was trained how to be a 
spy. He was shown how to use fake credit cards, how to infiltrate 
extremist groups without raising suspicions and how to interact with his
 MI5 handlers.

During the 
investigation into the 2004 Madrid bombings, which killed 191 people, he
 provided vital intelligence on the kind of detonation system used.

On
 the day of the 7/7 bus and Tube attacks on London the following year, 
he helped to track down extremists linked to the bombers.

He claims he was repeatedly told by MI5 that Mr Blunkett and Mr Blair were very pleased with his work.

During
 his time with MI5, he says he was paid £300 a week, given housing 
benefit and had meetings with his MI5 handlers every three days.

When
 he was working on important missions he was taken to meet senior MI5 
officers in a safe house, 15 minutes from Waterloo Station in London.

Blindfolded in the back of a van, he was driven to a top-secret building which was sound-proofed and had tinted windows.

But in February 2006, he was told that the relationship was being  terminated because MI5 felt he was no longer any use to them.

Mr
 Blunkett has denied having any knowledge of the case. But the man’s 
lawyer, Christophe Marchand, said: ‘They told him that if he agreed to 
work for MI5 he would have a new life in the UK.

'But
 he was very vulnerable at this time, he was young and held in solitary 
confinement where he was psychologically weak. He believed he had no 
choice.’
