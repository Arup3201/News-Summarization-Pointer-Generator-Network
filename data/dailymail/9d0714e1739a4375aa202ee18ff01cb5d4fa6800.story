A Queensland man and his father allegedly poured honey on a man's genitals to attract ants before killing him over a drug dispute, a court has heard.

Matthew Leslie Armitage, 22, and his father Stephen John Armitage, 46, of Cooloola Cove, are accused of abducting Shaun Barker from a Broadbeach service station and torturing him for several days in December 2013.

Grisly details of what the pair and a third man allegedly inflicted on Barker in the days before they allegedly killed him were detailed during Matthew Armitage's bail hearing in the Supreme Court in Brisbane on Thursday.

All three are charged with murder, misconduct with a corpse, torture and deprivation of liberty.

The Supreme Court in Brisbane heard shocking details of a murder where Shaun Barker was tortured and murdered over a drug dispute

The court was told Barker endured days of torture, including being zip-tied to a tree and having honey poured over his genitals to attract ants.

He was also allegedly held prisoner inside an esky and denied water.

'It was also alleged (Mr Barker) was forced to consume the drug fantasy and he was subjected to other assaults before his body was found,' Justice David Boddice said.

Mr Barker was allegedly involved in the production of illicit drugs with his accused killers.

Justice Boddice denied Armitage bail, saying he considered him a flight risk because he faced mandatory life imprisonment if convicted.

Barker's body was discovered in a state forest at Tin Can Bay (pictured), months after his disappearance

He also said he was concerned Armitage could pose a risk to witnesses given his father had allegedly threatened a witness.

'I'm satisfied that there's a risk that the applicant, if released on bail, could interfere with witnesses or endanger a person's safety,' he said.

Barker was reported missing by his family on January 14.

The 33-year-old's burnt skeletal remains were found in a state forest at Tin Can Bay, north of Brisbane, in April.
