The toddler, who has not been identified, was killed in a shed next to the home in Eureka, Texas around noon on Monday.

The child was hit once in the head with a bullet from a 20-gauge shotgun and pronounced dead at the scene by emergency responders.

Two adults were home at the time of the shooting but it appears that the children were unsupervised in the shed.

Navarro County Sheriff Elmer Tanner told MailOnline today that the gun was in the shed where the boys were playing.

The weapon belongs to a member of the family but it is not exactly clear who holds ownership.

Family members told authorities that they believed the gun to be secure and not in reach of the children. 

Sheriff Elmer Tanner said that under Texas law, children under the age of ten could not be charged with a crime.

An investigation is ongoing into whether other charges may be filed.
