A 21-year-old man who was deported from China arrived in handcuffs at Adelaide airport on Friday night to be charged for bashing his mother to death three years ago.

Wei Li,was arrested at Sydney airport on Friday morning after arriving on an Air China flight from Beijing. He later appeared via videolink in a Sydney court which ordered his extradition to South Australia.

Li will be charged with the murder of his mother, 41-year-old Emma Mei Tian, before appearing in the Adelaide Magistrates Court on Monday.

Wei Li, 21, who was deported from China, arrived in handcuffs at Adelaide airport on Friday night to be charged with brutally bashing his mother to death three years ago

An Australia-wide travel alert was issued by South Australian police for Li who had been named as the murder suspect after the brutally bashed body of Ms Tian was found in her suburban Burnside home on March 19, 2011.

However, when federal police called to say the student had turned up at Melbourne Airport, their calls to two SA police mobile phones went unanswered, with the messages not retrieved until the next day, by which time Li had already left the country.

Detective Inspector Greg Hutchins admitted on Friday that the disappearance of Li was not handled appropriately at the time.

Following a three-year manhunt, Chinese authorities recently advised their Australian counterparts Li was in China without a valid visa and would be deported to Australia.

Li's movements in China in the past three years were unknown,Det Insp Hutchins added.

Ms Tian's husband, who was in China on business at the time of the killing, was struggling to cope with the news of his son's arrest, he said.

‘On one hand his son will be charged with murder once he arrives back in Adelaide, and on the other hand it was his wife who was murdered - he is finding it difficult at the present time,’ he said.

Assistant Commissioner Paul Dickson described the arrest as a significant development.

‘Murder investigations never close and this arrest demonstrates SAPOL's commitment to ensure offenders are held accountable for their actions,’ he said.

Ms Tian's body, which was wrapped tightly in bedding, was found by a friend in an upstairs bedroom.
