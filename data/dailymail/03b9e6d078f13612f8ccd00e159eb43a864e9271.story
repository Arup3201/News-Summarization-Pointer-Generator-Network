President George W. Bush was not made aware of the harsh interrogation techniques that the CIA was using on terrorism detainees until four years after it first began using the tactics, a report released today by the Senate Intelligence Committee revealed.

And even after Bush was informed by the government agency of the program, the CIA kept from the president the extent of the program's cruelty and ineffectiveness at obtaining reliable information, the 500-page document said.

Other cabinet-level officials, including Secretary of State Colin Powell and Vice President Dick Cheney, were also kept in the dark for some time, according to the report. 

White House officials who did have knowledge of the CIA's actions were concerned that Powell 'would blow his stack,' one email published by the Senate committee shows, so he was not told immediately.

Former President George W. Bush is pictured here with then-Vice President Dick Cheney, right, and then-Secretary of State Colin Powel, left, during a September, 2001 cabinet meeting. A Senate report released today on the CIA's interrogation tactics during the Bush administration revealed that neither Bush nor members of his cabinet knew about the government agency's actions when they first began

'The CIA provided extensive amounts of inaccurate and incomplete information related to the operation and effectiveness of the CIA's Detention and Interrogation Program to the White House, the National Security Council principals, and their staffs,' an executive summary of the intelligence committee's report states.

'This prevented an accurate and complete understanding of the program by Executive Branch officials, thereby impeding oversight and decision-making.' 

It goes on to say that 'specific questions from White House officials were not answered truthfully or fully' by the CIA and that the government agency misled the National Security Council so it could continue using the questionable tactics, arguing that '[t]ermination of this program will result in loss of life, possibly extensive.'

The redacted document, based on a 6,700 page classified report, asserts that CIA records show that Bush was not briefed by the agency on the techniques, which Democrats say amounted to torture at times, until April of 2006.

At that point, the study found that 38 of the 39 terrorism suspects who were mistreated had already been interrogated by the CIA, as the expanded interrogation program had already been underway since 2002.

Furthermore, at the direction of top White House officials, then-Secretary of State Powell and then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld were not told of the program until September of 2003, despite being key members of the president's national security team. 

Cheney and then-National Security Adviser Condoleeza Rice, who would later lead the State Department under Bush, were not informed until sometime after that, and they too did not receive complete information about the program. 

According to the Senate report: 'An internal CIA email from July 2003 noted that "... the WH [White House] is extremely concerned [Secretary] Powell would blow his stack if he were to be briefed on what's been going on." '

Vice President Dick Cheney, left, Powell, center left, and National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, right, pictured here in the Oval Office with the president on April 18, 2002, learned of the CIA program sometime after the first year. President Bush, center right, wasn't told until 2006, the Senate report claims

The email, sent from the CIA's acting general counsel, John Rizzo, did not say who from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue had instructed him to keep quiet, only that White House officials were concerned that dissemination of information to cabinet officials would result in leaks to the media. 

Deputy Secretary of State Richard Armitage would later complain that that he and Powell were 'cut out' of key national security decisions as a result, it said. 

Neither the vice president nor the president were ever told of the exact locations of the CIA's overseas black sites at which they carry out the interrogation, which created a diplomatic snafu for Cheney once, Democratic aides who spoke with Bloomberg View said.

Roughly five months after learning of the methods being employed by the CIA President Bush acknowledged in a Sept. 6, 2006 speech that the agency had used an 'alternative set of procedures' to interrogate detainees. 

The speech was vetted by the CIA, however, the Senate's report says, and based on the inaccurate information provided by the CIA. Thus Bush overplayed the significance of information acquired from detainees and the effectiveness of the CIA's interrogation techniques. 

According to the report, at one point White House Counsel instructed the CIA not to fully brief the president on the water boarding techniques the agency was using.

The aides who spoke with Bloomberg said that once Bush learned the truth about some of the measures the CIA had taken, he was 'uncomfortable' with their actions. 

In a recent interview with CNN, Bush did not address rumors that the report would absolve him of involvement in the CIA's program nor did he shed any light on his knowledge of the agency's actions.

'Here’s what I’m going to say, that we’re fortunate to have men and women who work hard at the CIA serving on our behalf,' Bush told CNN host Candy Crowley, after noting that he hadn't yet seen the yet-to-be released Senate report.

'These are patriots. And whatever the report says, if it diminishes their contributions to our country, it is way off base,' he added.

'I knew the directors, I knew the deputy directors, I knew a lot of operators - these are good people. Really good people. And we’re lucky as a nation to have them.'

Former Vice President Dick Cheney, a vocal proponent of the program, told the New York Times that he had not yet been briefed on the report, either. 

Nevertheless, he told the news publication on Monday that the information he had received led him to believe that the CIA would be characterized inaccurately in the Senate's study.

'What I keep hearing out there is they portray this as a rogue operation and the agency was way out of bounds and then they lied about it,' he told the Times.

'I think that’s all a bunch of hooey. The program was authorized. The agency did not want to proceed without authorization, and it was also reviewed legally by the Justice Department before they undertook the program,' he claimed.

The Senate report, five and a half years in the making, also claims that the CIA fed DOJ lies, as well, though.

In at least one instance, the paper says, the CIA assured DOJ that the medical care of a detainee, Abu Zubaydah, who sustained a bullet wound during his capture would be put first. It then told its own staff that the interrogation of the combatant should take 'precedence' over his medical needs. 

The CIA released a statement refuting key findings of the Senate's study today, including the claim that Bush was not briefed on the true nature of its actions until midway through his second term.

'While the Agency records on the subject are admittedly incomplete, former President Bush has stated in his autobiography that he discussed the program, including its use of enhanced techniques, with then-[CIA Director George] Tenet in 2002, prior to the application of the techniques on Abu Zubaydah, and personally approved the techniques,' it said.
