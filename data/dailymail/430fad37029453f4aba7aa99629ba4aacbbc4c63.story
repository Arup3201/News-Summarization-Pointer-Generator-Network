Bolton boss Neil Lennon will this week step up his efforts to sign Kris Commons from Celtic.

Commons has become an increasingly peripheral figure under Ronny Deila and again had to be content with a place on the bench in Saturday’s goalless draw with Ross County at Parkhead.

Celtic maintain that contract talks with Commons and his representative are on-going but, as yet, there has been no breakthrough to keep the player in Glasgow beyond the summer.

Lennon is prepared to sign Commons on a pre-contract agreement but would prefer to pay for him next month

At 31, the former Scottish internationalist is ideally seeking a long-term deal but the club have been reluctant to offer such contracts to players of that age.

Deila has denied that the best Commons can hope for is a flat one-year extension - but it’s thought that clauses which would potentially trigger additional years would be appearance-related.

Former Parkhead boss Lennon, however, is willing to offer the player the long-term deal he craves at the Macron Stadium as he seeks to add to a squad that is now eyeing the Championship play-off places.

The Northern Irishman signed him for Celtic from Derby County for just £300,000 in January 2011 and he proved to be a revelation for that price tag.

Commons hit 31 goals last term to land the player of the year awards from both the Scottish Football Writers’ Association and PFA Scotland but has often found himself surplus to requirements under the new Celtic regime.

With midfielder Stefan Johansen the preferred option for his fellow Norwegian Deila in the role behind the striker, Commons has largely been demoted to the bench this campaign.

And, although his preference is to stay in Glasgow, the offer of long-term stability south of the border looks set to take the former Stoke, Nottingham Forest and Derby player back there.
