A frail Joan Rivers gave what appears to be her final press interview just days before she was rushed to hospital suffering cardiac arrest, speaking of her long history with doctors, her fear of losing her voice and how her inevitable death would come as a 'big blow' to her daughter, Melissa.

The irrepressible comedian sat down with The Sunday Times magazine from her daughters home in Los Angeles shortly before returning to her home in New York and undergoing routine throat surgery, in a procedure that would leave her on life support.

Times journalist Camilla Long writes that the 81-year-old 'has practically no voice when we meet: just a tiny, scratchy, drawl'.

Rivers, long a pioneer of plastic surgery, said her focus was no longer cosmetic enhancements but ways in which she keep her tired voice box from carrying on.

Last words: The final interview Joan Rivers conducted before her death on September 4 gives insight into her dealings with doctors, her obsession with her voice and her relationship with her daughter

Of her countless encounters with doctors, she spoke of enjoying the 'auditioning' process when it came to those operating on her.

She said she would 'ask them everything' and hound them with questions.

Rivers said she was particularly weary of anesthesiologists.

She would ask: 'Who are you and when did you last have a glass of wine?'

On August 28, Rivers stopped breathing during a procedure on her vocal cords at a clinic on Manhattan's Upper East Side.

She was rushed to Mount Sinai and places in a medically induced coma after suffering cardiac arrest.

Rivers was then moved onto life life support.

On September 4 the family announced she had died.

The veteran comic - who was known, in her later years, to cry very easily - appeared worried about the effect her death would have on daughter Melissa, her only child with husband Edgar Rosenberg, who committed suicide in 1987.

Ominously, Rivers said her death would come as a 'big blow' to Melissa.

'Melissa says, ''I don’t want to hear about it, I don’t want to talk about it’', but I say, it’s comi-i-i-ing!' Rivers told The Times magazine.

'It’s inevitable. It’s no longer an abstract thing.

'It’s like, God, I’m in my eighties.

'Nobody, when I die, is going to say, “how young?”

'They’re going to say, she had a great ride.'

'Big blow': Rivers, 81, said she worried about the effect her death was going to have on her daughter Melissa just days before she died

While often somber, the interview piece still contains plenty of the biting wit Rivers was legendary for.

Notably old-fashioned, she particularly took aim at the modern man.

'Men don’t stand up when you come into the room,' she raged.

'I go onto a plane and no one helps me to put my bags overhead.

'I’m an old woman! Plus a celebrity!'

She also said women should think twice before moving with a man when they are not married.

'(There are) no rules, no consequences.

'I think it’s a pity girls live with men in the hope that one day they’ll marry them.'

Rivers was laid to rest Sunday at Temple Emanu-El, a Jewish Synagogue just a few blocks from her apartment in Manhattan.
