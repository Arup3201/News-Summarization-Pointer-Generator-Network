A holiday with engineer Trevor Cox would certainly be a memorable one.

While his fellow travellers are holding up cameras, Professor Cox is likely to be holding up a dictaphone.

And instead of taking in the sights of the Alps, the sound engineer is much happier jumping into sewers and camping out in abandoned buildings.

That’s because the University of Salford professor is on a ‘soundseeing’ mission to capture the sonic wonders of the world.

‘The sounds of many places we visit are part of the experience,’ he said. ‘And in some cases, what we hear is more important than what we see.’

Professor Cox has set up a website detailing his acoustic adventures to ancient mausoleums, eerie caves and creaking icebergs. 

Professor Cox claims that there is an area under four archways in New York's Grand Central station where you can experience a special sound effect.

On the way to the lower concourse, two people standing at opposite ends of the underpass can hear each other perfectly, even though they are 10 metres away.

'The stone walls and ceiling do a great job of
 reflecting the sound on a path across to the opposite side of the 
underpass,' said Professor Cox.

His new book, The Sound Book, also catalogues his journeys to these areas.

‘They're places that you want to visit not for the more typical reason, that they've got beautiful views, but because they've got beautiful sounds,’ he told Smithsonian magazine.

St. Paul's Cathedral's whispering gallery in London was an obvious choice for his adventures.

Thanks to the design of the building, created by Sir Christopher Wren, a whisper can travel around a wall.

The sound is trapped against the inside of the curved dome wall. By tilting the walls inwards at the top, less sound goes upwards and gets lost to the top of the dome.

But Professor Cox has also visited some less obvious whispering galleries.

One such area is the abandoned spy station at Teufelsberg in Berlin which is on top of Devil’s Mountain rising up from the Grünewald forest.

This man-made hill was constructed from millions of cubic metres of rubble created by bombing raids and artillery bombardments during World War II.

‘There are a number of different sounds effects you can play with in the dome,’ said Professor Cox.

‘Climb on top of the concrete plinth and get into the middle of the sphere and the strong focus creates richocheting sounds when you clap your hands.

‘Alternatively, you can try whispering just off-centre, and see if you can find the right spot for whispering into one of your own ears.’

One of the most interesting sites Professor Cox visited is an abandoned oil tank in Inchindown, in the Scottish highlands.

Earlier this year, it earned a place in the record books after producing the world's longest echo. 

Lasting an incredible 75 seconds, the 
reverberation smashed the previous record - also set in Scotland more 
than 40 years ago - by more than a minute.

It
 was recorded by Professor Cox in a tank measuring twice the length of a
 football pitch, which was 30ft wide and more than 44ft high.

The discovery was made by Professor Cox he climbed into the tank at Inchindown, near Invergordon, and started singing and shouting.

'I was like a toddler sitting at a piano for the first time, thrashing the ivories to see what sounds would come out,' he said. 

'Reluctantly, after a few minutes I stopped playing with the acoustics and started preparing for my measurements.'

Many of Professor Cox's sonic wonders are also result of natural marvels such as the Kelso Dunes in the Mojave Desert, one of about 40 droning dune sites worldwide.

At certain times, avalanches of sand fall down these dunes to create bizarre humming sounds.

Professor Cox claims acoustic tourism can be done virtually anywhere – even in his hometown of Salford.

‘Some of my favourite sounds in Manchester can be found underneath the arches and bridges that were built during the industrial revolution,’ he writes in his blog.

‘There are plenty of tourist sites where what you hear is essential to the experience, sometimes to the point of being more important than what you see.’
