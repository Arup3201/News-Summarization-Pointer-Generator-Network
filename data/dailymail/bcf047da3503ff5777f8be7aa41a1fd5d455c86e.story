A council made an embarrassing error when it installed a plaque commemorating a visit to a town by King Charles I in 1663 - despite the fact he was executed 14 years earlier.

North Tyneside Council erected the blue plaque at the Governor's Tree half way between North Shields and Tynemouth after a previous one was stolen.

But they made a mistake with the date as Charles I was beheaded for treason on January 30, 1649 - and had actually visited the spot in 1633.

Can you spot the mistake? North Tyneside Council made an error when it installed this plaque

The next month the monarchy was abolished and Oliver Cromwell came to power.

The Governor's tree is a traditional boundary between North Shields and Tynemouth in North Tyneside.

The exact wording of the plaque reads: 'Governor's Tree. Site of the Governor's Tree, where important visitors to Tynemouth were met as they disembarked in Pow Burn.

'These visitors included King Charles I in 1663 and King Henry VIII's commissioners, when they came to dispossess the monks of Tynemouth Priory in 1539.'

A spokesman for North Tyneside Council said: 'We are aware of the error in the date on the plaque and have already arranged for this to be corrected.'

Off with his head: Charles I was beheaded for treason on January 30, 1649. The king is pictured here by Sir Anthony Van Dyck

Charles's reign ended after civil war broke out in 1642 and although his Royalist army had 
the upper hand at first, the king's advantage did not last for long. By May 
1646, Charles surrendered.

Charles's fate was sealed outside Banqueting House in Whitehall, London. The 
assembled crowd is reported to have groaned as the axe came down.

Although the monarchy was later restored in 1660, the execution of 
Charles I destroyed the idea of an all-powerful and unquestionable 
monarch.
