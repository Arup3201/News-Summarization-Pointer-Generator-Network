England will provide a clue to their one-day strategy for their forthcoming seven-match series in Sri Lanka when they omit Alex Hales from their top three in Friday's warm-up game against Sri Lanka A in Colombo.

The 25-year-old Nottinghamshire opener, who is currently third in the ICC's Twenty20 world rankings, has been touted by many as a potential match-winner at next year's 50-over World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.

But England are set instead to go in to their tour opener with a top three of captain Alastair Cook, Moeen Ali and Ian Bell – leaving them open once more to the accusation that their approach to one-day cricket is simply too conservative to challenge the world's best sides.

Hales has played just four one-day internationals, all against India at the end of the summer, when he made only 92 runs at a strike-rate of 68, with a top score of 42.

But four games is hardly a scientific sample, and many still remember his breath-taking unbeaten 116 from 64 balls to dispatch the Sri Lankans during the World Twenty20 earlier this year in Bangladesh. As one six after another flew into the Chittagong night sky, it seemed England had unearthed a world-beater for both forms of limited-overs cricket.

In his next match against Sri Lanka – another Twenty20 game at The Oval in May – he top-scored with 66 from 41 balls, with no other England batsman reaching 30. It is fair to say he is the one England player the Sri Lankans truly fear.

Yet coach Peter Moores and Cook took note of Hales's struggles against the tight line served up by India's opening bowlers in August and September, and have also borne in mind the spin option provided by Ali in a part of the world where slow bowlers need little encouragement.

Even so, for those looking for signs that England will embrace an aggression-first approach as they seek to avoid a sixth successive World Cup flop, the news that Hales is not being given a licence to thrill at the top of the order will feel dispiriting.

At a training session at the Nondescripts Cricket Club in Colombo today, Moores said: 'We're trying to move to be a more positive side, with both bat and ball, take every opportunity to score runs and put pressure on the opposition.

'It's not a simple process to say "I'm going to walk out and whack it".

'We saw that in that India game, when Rohit Sharma [who made 264 against Sri Lanka at Kolkata] started slowly, and then suddenly found freedom and played beautifully.

'We've got to do that. It's not actually complicated. You've just got to find your way of doing it as an individual, and a team.'

With only two warm-up games scheduled before Wednesday's first one-day international here in Colombo, it looks as if Hales's best hope will be for Bell to fail twice.

It is not the ideal sentiment at the start of a tour which England hope will provide them with a platform to shock the world in Australia and New Zealand.
