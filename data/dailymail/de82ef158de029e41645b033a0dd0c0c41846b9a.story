A disgraced town crier has been stripped of his post after falsely boasting that he had a distinguished military career and wearing war medals he bought online.

Anthony Church was often seen around Oxfordshire wearing the replica  medals, having allegedly claimed he was a regimental sergeant major with the Coldstream Guards during the Falklands War.

The 62-year-old, from Cowley, Oxford, wore the Order of the British Empire, the South Atlantic Medal for those who fought in the Falklands, and a General Service Medal with a Northern Ireland clasp.

Mr Church, who worked as a town crier in Banbury, Oxford, Thame, Chipping Norton and Wallingford, today apologised for his 'grave error in judgment'

Town crier Anthony Church (pictured left and his medals, right), from Cowley, Oxford, has been stripped of his post after falsely claiming he had a distinguished military career

The 62-year-old (pictured with fellow town criers from around the country) often wore the British Empire Medal and the South Atlantic Medal for those who fought in the Falklands which he had purchased online

He also used the title BEM - which stands for British Empire Medal - after his name on Banbury Town Council's website and apparently wore the award as well.

But Mr Church was today forced to apologise for his 'grave error of judgement' after it emerged that he had never served in the Armed Forces.

Instead, Mr Church admitted he had bought the medals off the internet before wearing them in public, including at Remembrance Day parades.

He has now been forced to step down from the Loyal Company of Town Criers and the Ancient and Honorable Guild of Town Criers.

Issuing an apology, Mr Church, who worked as a town crier in Banbury, Oxford, Thame, Chipping Norton and Wallingford, said he had 'made a mistake'.

He claimed the BEM medal was awarded to his late father Jack Church for taking part in the Berlin Airlift and that he mistakenly believed he was entitled to wear it.

He added that he wore the other medals as a 'tribute' to former servicemen. 

He said: 'I was told several years ago that as the sole-surviving son I was entitled to wear the BEM and put BEM after my name.

'Tribute': The disgraced town crier claims the medals were worn to honour the Armed Forces 

Church used the title BEM after his name, which stands for British Empire Medal, pictured, and apparently wore the award as well 

'I also wanted, with the anniversary of the Falklands and World War One, to show my solidarity for those people who had served in these campaigns and found a place I could purchase replica medals and purchased a South Atlantic Medal.

'In September I contacted Buckingham Palace on an unrelated matter and received a letter back asking when I had been awarded the BEM.

'I wrote back explaining the situation and was told that I had been misinformed and was in fact not allowed to use the title or wear the medal as it would lead people to assume that I had been awarded the medal, so I immediately removed all medals.'

He added: 'I realise now that I made a grave error of judgement with this.

'It was very stupid and I categorically now apologise to everybody who has served in the forces. It was never my intention to cause any distress or upset.

'I made a mistake, I told someone I'd served and it's been going on from there. I can't apologise enough for the hurt and distress it has probably caused people. 

'People will probably feel, with hindsight, that I have misled them. I was in the wrong. I did not mean to offend anyone in the military - it was meant to be a show of support.

'It was never my intention to cause any distress but it has backfired and cost me everything.'

Mr Church was exposed by a group calling itself the Walter Mitty Hunters Club, a group of former servicemen which investigates those who illegitimately wear medals.

The Royal British Legion said medals awarded to a deceased service or ex-service people may be worn on the right breast by a near relative. Mr Church wore the medals he acquired on the left. 

On their Facebook page, John Theman, Secretary of The Loyal Company of Town Criers, said: 'We wish to thank The Walter Mitty Hunters Club for outing Anthony Church.

'We wish to make it known that his actions are deplorable and beneath contempt.

'He has resigned from all Town Crier positions, but rest assured, even if he hadn't resigned, he would have been thrown out of our organisation in disgrace.

'A month ago we investigated his wearing of medals, and he apologised profusely, saying it was a one-off, and we accepted his apology. However the fact he claimed the awards of MBE and BEM really is astounding.

'The Loyal Company of Town Criers has immediately removed all trace of Anthony Church from our websites.

'To the many genuine Town Criers in the UK and beyond, this will come as a huge shock, so, once again, well done sirs.' 

Chairman of the Oxfordshire Royal British Legion, Jim Lewendon said: 'I saw Mr Church wearing the medals at Remembrance time on his left breast and assumed they were his.

'And a few years back he told me he had been in the Coldstream Guards. Wearing the medals like this is an insult to the bravery of the troops who served.

'I can't believe Anthony was a pretender and I hope he can put this behind him.' 

In 2012 Mr Church, from Cowley, in Oxford, led Team GB athletes to the spectacular opening ceremony for the London Olympics.

He was one of three representatives of the Ancient & Honourable Guild of Town Criers who dressed in traditional liveries to help marshall athletes from 205 nations from the Olympic Village to the stadium in time for the Athletes' Parade.
