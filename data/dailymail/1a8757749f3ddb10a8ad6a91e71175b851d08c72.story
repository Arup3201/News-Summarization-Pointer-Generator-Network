A stripper headbutted a fellow exotic dancer and broke her nose because she was jealous over the amount of punters she was attracting, a court heard.

Romanian dancer Maria Badea, 20, lashed out at Gina Ciobotaru for allegedly stealing her customers at the French Pussycat Club in Soho, London.

After warning Miss Ciobotaru, who is in her early 20s and also Romanian, that she would be waiting for her outside the club Badea headbutted the dancer and punched her in the face, the court was told.

Miss Ciobotaru was so badly injured in the attack she had to have an operation on her nose and was off work for one month, Southwark Crown Court was told.

Badea claims she lashed out because Miss Ciobotaru called her a 'whore' and a 'pervert' and bad-mouthed her family.

Giving evidence Miss Ciobotaru, who no longer works at the club, said Badea became angry she was taking her customers last February.

She said: 'She told me "You do money, I do money as well".

'She told me she was going to wait for me outside. She said she will punch me.'

Miss Ciobotaru said she told the manager who offered to walk her home, but she decided to go alone as she was tired and was then set upon by Badea.

The alleged victim said that when she called police Badea tried to take her phone and told her: 'Police won't do anything. I am a woman.'

Both women worked at the French Pussycat club in Soho at the time of the alleged attack in February

Badea claims Miss Ciobotaru, who she previously allowed to live with her for two weeks when she had nowhere to stay, screamed at her 'I will f*** your mother' in their native Romanian.

Sharmila Salvi, defending, said this was one of the worst things you could say in their language and was particularly offensive to Badea as her mother had abandoned her when she was just two weeks old.

Miss Ciobotaru said the attack had left her scared to go out and that Badea had threatened to get someone to follow her.

Badea, of Brent, north west London, is accused of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

The 20-year-old admits hitting Miss Ciobotaru but says it was a slap rather than a punch and was not pre-meditated as the prosecution allege.

The trial at Southwark Crown Court continues.
