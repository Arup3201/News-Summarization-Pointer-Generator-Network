Sir Richard Branson has been asked to continue running the West Coast Rail Line for another year, as minsters scramble to keep trains moving.

In an embarrassing u-turn, the Department for Transport had to plead with Virgin Trains to remain in control of the line for between nine and 13 months despite stripping it of the lucrative franchise in August.

Virgin was due to hand over the line to rival First Group on December 9 but ‘significant technical flaws’ in the contract competition were unearthed this month, which saw three civil servants suspended and the deal torn up.

Virgin Trains will now run the services in the short term while the government decides who will operate the franchise on a more permanent basis.

Today Sir Richard said on Twitter: 'Positive day for all the wonderful staff at Virgin Trains.'

The decision marks a major PR coup for Sir Richard, who said on Twitter: 'Positive day for all the wonderful staff at Virgin Trains.'

This summer the tycoon saw his complaints that the contest had not been fair repeatedly rebuffed by the government.

He branded the bidding process for the London to Scotland line ‘insane’ and launched a legal challenge.

He called on David Cameron to intervene, but the Prime Minister was assured that the decision was safe.

As the DfT prepared for the court case, major flaws were discovered in the use of inflation and passenger numbers.

The future of the West Coast Main Line, which runs from London to Scotland, will remain uncertain for several months

The collapse of the deal is expected to cost taxpayers more than £100million in compensation and re-running a new bidding process.

The quick-fix of Virgin running services until next year will be followed by an interim franchisee before the full-length contract is awarded.

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said today: ‘The cancellation of the InterCity West Coast franchise is deeply regrettable and I apologise to the bidders involved and taxpayers who have a right to expect better.

‘My priority now is to fix the problem and the first step is to take urgent action to ensure that on December 9 services continue to run to the same standard and passengers are not affected.

‘I believe Virgin remaining as operator for a short period of time is the best way to do this and my officials and I will be working flat out to make this happen.’

As the rail chaos grips the department, Mr Mcloughlin also announced he was pausing the live competitions to run services on Essex Thameside, Great Western and Thameslink.

Two independent reviews will also examine what went to catastrophically wrong with the West Coast competition and the way the DfT runs its rail franchise programme.

Virgin has run the West Coast line since 1997 but in August Justine Greening, the then Transport Secretary, announced she was handing a new 13-year deal to FirstGroup.

As DfT officials prepared for Virgin’s legal challenge to the decision, they uncovered major problems with the economic model used to decide who to award the contract to.

Today a Virgin Trains spokesman said: 'Our customers have made clear they want us to continue our excellent service and we now have the chance to deliver that and offer customers some short-term continuity.

'We will now be working hard to make sure we continue to provide the service that has made us successful. We are grateful for the fantastic support from customers and staff over recent months.'

Angela Eagle, Labour's shadow transport secretary, said ministers could not claim to be unaware of the details of the deal.

She told BBC News: 'These are multi-billion pound contracts. This contract was supposed to run for up to 15 years. It’s simply not good enough for ministers to claim that it was all a technical issue, and that they couldn’t be expected to look at this, at the same time as they’ve made franchising much more complex, they have then taken away part of the Department’s ability to deal with this, and removed the department’s capacity to get it externally checked.

'That to me seems to be squarely a problem with ministerial oversight, ministerial leadership, and it’s not correct for them to try and blame three civil servants for what’s gone wrong – especially not before their own investigation has even reported.'

The Flying Scotsman service was reintroduced by the government-owned Directly Operated Railways

The decision to ask Virgin to continue running trains on the West Coast line means ministers have rejected the idea of running the line themselves.

Renationalisation of the railways is something the unions have demanded for years.In 2009 National Express walked away from the East Coast Main Line franchise, and the Labour government took control of services.

A new government-owned company, Directly Operated Railways, was created and has run the services ever since.

It recorded a seven per cent rise in profits to £7.1 million in 2011-12.

In the four weeks to August 19, 93 per cent of East Coast trains were on time up from 87 per cent on 2011.

The four-hour Flying Scotsman express 
service from Edinburgh to London (pictured) was reinstated and extra services to 
Lincoln and Harrogate were introduced.

The apparent success of the state-running of services caused the RMT transport union to call for the same to happen on the West Coast line.

Responding to the news that Virgin will continue to operate the franchise for up to 13 months, RMT leader Bob Crow said today: 'The Government are ideologically opposed to public ownership of the railways and, in collusion with the private train operators, have stitched up a shabby deal that will enable them to rerun the whole franchise fiasco in a year’s time.

'Richard Branson and his shareholders are laughing all the way to the bank. Not only have they made hundreds of millions from the rail privatisation lottery but they have now scooped the rollover as well.

'We will continue to fight for public ownership of the railways, a position supported by the vast majority of the British people. This short-term political fix will not detract from the call for rail to be run as a public service free from the chaos and greed of privatisation.'

DOR overhauled the East Coast timetable, introducing almost 20 new weekday services.

It also invested in better First Class carriages including at seat food and drink and on board wi-fi which lead to First Class passenger numbers rising by a third.
