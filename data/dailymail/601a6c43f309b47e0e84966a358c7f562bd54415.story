A husband has been sentenced to 20 lashes after alleging his wife was not a virgin when they married.

He was accused of suggesting his bride was lying about her virginity during a public outburst in front of her father and other neighbourhood elders, according to a Saudi news website.

The humiliated wife went to court to prove her honour and reputation, Al-Sharq Online reported.

A judge in the Saudi city of Mecca 
ordered the public flogging of the Yemeni man to be carried out in one 
session because he could not offer any evidence to refute the claims.

He says she had been married and divorced before marrying him.

As
 is common in conservative parts of the Arab world, he says the marriage
 contract stipulated she was a virgin at the time of their wedding.

Saudi Arabia has faced strong international condemnation over its use of corporal and capital punishment.

Public beatings and executions are common place in the autocratic Kingdom.

A
 political activist was this month sentenced to 300 lashes and four 
years in prison for calling for a constitutional monarchy in Saudi 
Arabia.

Omar al-Saeed is the fourth member of the Saudi Civil and Political Rights Association (ACPRA) to be jailed this year after the group issued statements attacking the ruling family over its human rights record and calling for democracy.

Saeed, who has also been issued with a worldwide travel ban for his so-called transgressions, did not have legal representation at the secret hearing when he was sentenced, ACPRA said in a statement on its website.

Earlier this week, the wife of an imprisoned Saudi blogger who denounced Islam claimed her husband was facing the death penalty.

Raif Badawi, who set up the Free Saudi Liberals blog is currently in prison, and according to his wife Ensaf Haidar, he must go before a high court on a charge of apostasy.

He would receive the death penalty if convicted by the courts according to Amnesty International.

In July, a criminal court found Badawi guilty of insulting Islam through his website and in television comments.

He was sentenced to seven years in prison and 600 lashes, but his lawyer has appealed against the punishment.

Badawi set up his website in 2008 and has been in prison since 2012.
