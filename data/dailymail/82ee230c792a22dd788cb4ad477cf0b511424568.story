A world map redrawn according to each country's population reduces the size of some countries, keeps many the same, and has a few that show an enormous shift.

The new cartogram, created by Reddit user TeaDranks, visibly compares all of the world's countries, with many, including the United States and United Kingdom, staying almost exactly the same in terms of size versus their actual land area.

Others however, especially India, show massive growth, this as a result of their population, now at 1.3billion persons.

Countries with smaller populations, including Australia, Canada and Russia, are notably reduced on the map.

China's land mass on the map has also increased thanks to its population of 1.4 billion.

Other nations like Fiji with 859,000, Iceland with 328,000, Macau with 631,000, and Malta with 416,000, have been scaled down to a micro square.

Countries with less than 250,000 - such as Greenland which has a population of 56,000 - were too small to appear on the cartogram.

The map is an updated version of the first one released by the same creator 10 years ago.

Since then, it shows that India has grown by almost 200 million people while China has increased by about 60 million.

Australia's population, according to the map, has risen by more than three million since 2005.

And, once again, the United States and United Kingdom seem to be growing at a steady and proportionate rate.
