Detroit is the arson capital of the world, but recent freezing temperatures are making ice a bigger problem for homeowners in the run-down city.

A Tudor-style home in the city's historic Boston-Edison district has been turned into an ice castle after a water pipe burst four days ago in the six-degree temperatures.

E.T. Williamson Sr, 56, and his family lived in the home and says they lost all of their possessions because of the disaster, and that he's thinking about suing the company that owns the building.

Pretty but destructive: This Tudor-style home in Detroit, Michigan was frozen over on Friday after a third-floor water pipe burst as the region was experiencing 6F temperatures

'We've lost everything,' he told the Detroit Free-Press on Monday. 'We lost about $100,000 worth of things. It's all gone.'

Williamson, a Christian pastor, told the paper that the pipe burst on the third floor on Friday, causing water to fill the home and spill out of the windows. 

The water quickly froze creating amazing icicles that were as beautiful as they were destructive. The sheets of ice weighed down on the second floor to heavily that the ceiling caved into the first floor.

Williamson bought the home on West Boston and 14th in June 2011 for $70,000 but the house went into foreclosure when he fell behind on his taxes and is now owned by Winfire Management.

Homeless: Williamson says his family lost all of their possession when the pipe burst, which he estimates to equal about $100,000

Jeff Feuereisen is the new owner of the home, according to City of Detriot records that show he purchased the house for $13,100 in November 2011.  

'They came and asked me did we want to enter into a land contract to keep our house because they didn't want to put anyone out,' Williamson said.

Since Friday, the house has also been damaged by a fire, further resulting in loss of the family's belongings locked inside.   

'All my furniture, my couches, the stove, my son's 4-year-old Kawasaki motorcycle, everything is destroyed,' Williamson said. 'All of my suits, my shoes, and my wife's clothes. It's gone. My grandkids and my grown kids lost clothes and computers. We lost everything.'
