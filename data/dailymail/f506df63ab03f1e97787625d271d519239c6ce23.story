The missing Philae space probe that bumped down onto the surface of a comet 284 million miles from Earth could wake up from today.

Scientists at the European Space Agency have restarted efforts to listen for a signal from the stricken lander on comet 67p/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

They lost contact with the washing-machine sized spacecraft in November last year after it bounced several times before landing in a hollow below a cliff.

Starved of the sunlight it needed to power its suite of experiments, the lander's batteries went flat after around just 60 hours on the surface. 

ESA scientists have renewed efforts to contact the Philae lander on Comet 67p, shown in the illustration above

However, as the comet has travelled closer to the sun in its journey through the solar system, researchers hope Philae will get enough light to come back to life. 

The Rosetta probe, which was carrying Philae, launched into space in 2004, using the gravity of Earth and Mars to slingshot its way towards comet 67P.

It chased comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years, and entered orbit in August 2014.

After a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, the probe then successfully released the Philae lander from its grip to land on the comet on 12 November 2014, travelling at 1 metre (40 inches) per second relative to the comet.

But when it first made contact with the surface it failed to fire harpoons that would have kept it attached to the comet.

This resulted in it bouncing to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) above the comet before again landing on the surface. It then bounced again, but to a much lower altitude.

Scientists recently said that water on the comet was different to that on Earth - suggesting water on our world came from an asteroid, not a comet.

The European Space Agency has now turned on the communication unit on the Rosetta spacecraft that is orbiting the comet.

Stephen Ulamec, lander project manager at the German Aerospace Centre (DLR), said: 'Philae currently receives about twice as much solar energy as it did in November last year.

'It will probably still be too cold for the lander to wake up, but it is worth trying. The prospects will improve with each passing day.'

Comet 67p is now 186 million miles (300 million km) from the sun. Scientists hope that as the comet rotates and gets closer to the sun, Philae's solar panels will move out of the shade of the cliff it is resting under.

Philae touched down on 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on 12 November, but rather than landing softly, the failure of its harpoons and thrusters saw it bounce twice.

It first bounced to a height of 0.62 miles (1km) and then 65ft (20 metres) before finally coming to rest at an angle on uneven ground.

Blurry images captured the the spacecraft movement through the air.

Scientists described the comet's surface as being more like a trampoline, causing the probe to rebound so far.

It is thought the probe settled in a ditch beneath a cliff after bouncing more than half a mile from its original landing site.

The Rosetta orbiter took a number of images of Philae as it bounced, with its final suspected resting place in the top right. However, further attempts to find the lander at the foot of the cliff have failed to find the probe

Scientist have been pouring over photographs of the landing area using the mothership Rosetta in an attempt to find the missing probe.

Philae was able to send back a photograph - the first taken from the surface of a comet - of an overhanging cliff face that is thought to be obscuring the lander.

Before its batteries finally ran out, Philae managed to send back data on the few experiments it was able to conduct along with some images.

Among the discoveries to have been released so far is that the comet's surface appears to be made of a very hard 'sintered' ice.

Researchers also revealed that they had found organic molecules - the basic building blocks of life.

From several miles above the comet, Rosetta has also continued to provide a constant stream of images and data since it arrived.

But there are some fears that dust thrown up by the landing and movement of the comet itself could have covered the lander's solar panels.

This would mean it may struggle to get enough light to power its communication units and the experiments it is carrying on board.

Comet 67p is due to reach its closest point to the sun in August this year and this is when scientists believe they have the best chance of hearing back from the stricken lander.

Philae requires its internal temperature to reach at least -45 degrees C before it can wake up.

It will also require at least 5.5 watts from its solar panels to wake up.

Once awake, Philae will turn on its receiver every 30 minutes and listens for a signal from the Rosetta orbiter.

Koen Guerts, part of the Philae lander team at the DLR Control Centre, said the probe may have already woken up but is yet to send a signal home.

He said: 'Philae is designed so that, since November 2014, it has been using all the available solar energy to heat up.'

'At this time, we do not yet know that the lander is awake.To send us an answer, Philae must also turn its transmitter – and that requires additional power.'

Rosetta captured a mothership's view of Philae as it descended to the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on 12 November 2014 before losing contact with the probe after it bounced twice on the surface 

Philae needs a total of 19 watts to begin operating and allow two-way communication.

Over the next eight days the Rosetta orbiter is due to transmit signals to its lander and listen for the response during a series of 11 flybys.

Engineers have also sent new commands to the lander to optimise the heating and provide energy savings to improve its chances of communication with Earth.

Once Philae wakes up and can also transmit, it will first send data about its 'health' to Earth.

The scientific work with the 10 instruments on board Philae also depends on these results.

If sufficient energy cannot be stored in the battery, the solar energy available during the comet daytime will determine whether a reduced version of the measurements can be performed.

Currently, scientists believe that Philae is in sunlight for 1.3 hours - just a fraction of the 12.4 hour long day that the comet enjoys.

Mr Ulamec added: 'Once we can communicate with Philae again, the scientific work can begin.'
