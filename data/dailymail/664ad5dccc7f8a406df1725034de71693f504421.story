Indianapolis Colts linebacker Robert Mathis has been suspended for four games for violating the NFL's policy on performance enhancing drugs.

The announcement, made shortly before 5 p.m. Friday, means he will miss the first four games of the football season, The Indy Channel reports.

Mathis claims the test results are due to fertility medication he was taking to conceive a baby with his wife, Brandi.

Indianapolis Colt Robert Mathis has been suspended for four games as the NFL says he violated the policy against performance enhancing drugs

In a statement addressing the suspension, Mathis said he wanted his fans, 'particularly young people,' to know that he was not using performance enhancing drugs.

'Like many families, my wife and I
 faced fertility challenges, and I sought medical assistance. I 
specifically asked the doctor if the medication he prescribed for me 
would present a problem for NFL drug testing, and unfortunately, he 
incorrectly told me that it would not,' he wrote.

'I made the mistake of not calling
 the NFL or NFLPA to double check before I took the medication at the 
end of last season;' he continued. 'The union has worked very closely with me to present
 all of the facts and medical records for consideration of discipline 
that does not include a suspension because of the unique facts of my 
case, but the Commissioner refused the request. I am deeply saddened 
that this situation will prevent me from contributing to my team for 
four games, and I regret that I didn't cross check what my doctor told 
me before I took the medication.

Mathis said he only failed a test because he was taking fertility drugs to help conceive a baby with wife Brandi

'I hope that my fans will understand the
 unique circumstances involved here and continue to know that I am a man
 of integrity who would never intentionally circumvent the performance 
enhancing substance policy agreed to by the NFL and my union.

He concluded: 'The 
incredible blessing of this very upsetting situation is that, after I 
took the medication very briefly at the end of last season, we learned 
that my wife is expecting a baby. We are thrilled that we will be 
welcoming a new member in several months, but I apologize to my 
teammates, coaches and Colts fans that I will not be able to contribute 
to my team for the first four weeks of the 2014 season. I will work 
extremely hard during that time to stay in top football shape and will 
be prepared to contribute immediately upon my return.'
