Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has announced Australia is ready to 'play its part' in air strikes against Islamic State Jihadists in Iraq when a formal combat request is made.

At the NATO summit in Wales on Friday, Ms Bishop and Australian Defence Minister David Johnston met with leaders from the United States, the United Kingdom and other Western countries to discuss how to combat the 'scourge of the Islamic State', also known as ISIL.

Ms Bishop called ISIL 'a direct domestic security threat to Australia' and said Australia is prepared to join a US-led coalition of 'like-minded countries' to combat the extremists and stop them expanding beyond the region.

'The countries that have expressed a willingness to tackle ISIL head on have also looked at what more can be done in terms of air strikes and Australia will respond when a formal request is made,' Ms Bishop told reporters.

Ms Bishop said leaders also discussed the need to work closely with the Iraqi government and to provide humanitarian relief.

'The red line is combat troops on the ground. There is no interest from any country present to commit combat troops but there is much that can be done to combat ISIL in other ways and Australia is prepared to play its part in combating ISIL because it is a direct domestic security threat to Australia,' she said.

Australian Defence Force Chief Mark Binskin said the RAAF's fleet of older classic Hornet fighter bombers or its 24 Super Hornets could be deployed to operate in Iraq.

But Minister David Johnston stressed Australia was yet to receive an official request for combat assistance, saying on Friday 'we are still at an extremely early stage.'

'This is a very serious matter of committing young Australians to deal with an extremely dangerous organisation,' he told reporters. 'But naturally in the face of this tantamount genocide from this organisation the Australian Defence Force (ADF) starts to be ready.'

Ms Bishop declined to detail which specific countries were part of the coalition.

Also on the table at the NATO summit are sanctions against Russia, the conflict in Syria and Australia's involvement in support for the Afghan government going forward.

Australia is expected to use the  summit to lobby other G20 nations to help block Russia from the forum.

This week, Julie Bishop became the centre of a diplomatic twitter storm when Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs called her a 'he' in an attack on social media. The Ministry took to Twitter to criticize Bishop's attempt to ban Russia from the G20 summit in Brisbane later this year.

'The Australian FM's idea not to invite Russia to the G20 summit is not surprising but he should not lose sight of its principles,' tweeted Russia's MFA.

Australia's ambassador in Russia shot back a the ministry for confusing Ms Bishop's gender and added his own dig at Russia's controversial presence in Ukraine.

'Borders, genders – all a bit confusing right now!'  tweeted Ambassador Paul Myler.
