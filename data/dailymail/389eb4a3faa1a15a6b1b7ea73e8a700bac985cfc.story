The family of the businesswoman behind Stagecoach were terrorised in their own home during a raid by masked robbers.

Sarah Gloag - the daughter of multi-millionaire Ann Gloag - and Sarah's husband and two children were bound and gagged during the ordeal at their home outside Perth, Scotland.

Robbers made off with around half a million pounds worth of valuables, jewellery and cash after threatening the family with meat cleavers, it emerged today.

The raid happened when Sarah Gloag, 39, her husband Sundeep Salins and their three children were at their home, which is not far from Ann Gloag's Kinfauns Castle.

Two raiders wearing masks burst in and tied the hands, feet and mouths of the parents and youngest two children with tape.

Friends of the family told the Daily Record the two men 'threatened to kill them' if they tried to escape or raise the alarm.

A friend said: 'This was a horrible, vicious attack that has left the family deeply traumatised.'

Luckily, the eldest son was playing computer games at the time and wasn't seen by the gang. He later freed his parents and siblings.

A spokesman for Ann Gloag said: 'This was an horrific ordeal for the family members involved.

'Everyone is relieved the suspects have been apprehended and the family is co-operating fully with the police and assisting them in every way possible.

'Understandably, this has been a very difficult time for the whole family and we ask that their privacy is respected at this time.'

The terrifying robbery took place when two men arrived at the family home near Perth on Monday evening

Police Scotland have said two men are expected to appear in court tomorrow in connection with the incident.

A police spokesman said: 'Police Scotland can confirm that two men aged 40 and 57 years old have been arrested in connection with a robbery in Crieff on Sunday and a robbery in the Perthshire area on Monday.

'A report will be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal and they are expected to appear at Perth Sheriff Court on Thursday.'

Businesswoman Ann Gloag, 72, was listed Number 28 in the Sunday Times Rich List and is Scotland's second richest woman after author JK Rowling.

Ann and her brother, Sir Brian Souter, started the Stagecoach Group in 1980.

Ann Gloag, a trained nurse, has previously told how she amassed her wealth by 'fighting for survival'.

Before her business career, she worked as a unit sister in Bridge of Earn Hospital, Perthshire, where she met her future husband, Robin Gloag, while he was a patient.

By the 1970s, the couple were running a small caravan sales business. But, after 20 years in nursing, Mrs Gloag branched out.

The couple, along with Mrs Gloag's brother Brian Soutar, now chairman Stagecoach, bought a bus for £425. Their intention was to take the trip of a lifetime to China but the plan failed through visa problems.

Instead, the entrepreneurs were invited by a construction company to provide transport for workers travelling to building sites.

The brother and sister realised the potential and with their savings and their father's timely redundancy payment of £25,000, they bought two more buses.

Stagecoach expanded from its limited Perthshire routes to offering cheap tickets between Dundee and London.

The venture took off and Stagecoach Group is now an international company operating buses, trains, trams and ferries. 

Mrs Gloag serves as a non- executive director. Her former husband was killed in a car crash in December 2007.
