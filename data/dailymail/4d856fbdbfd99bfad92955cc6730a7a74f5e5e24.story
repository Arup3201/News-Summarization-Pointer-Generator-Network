You can never tell or prove someone is racist unless they actually say or show you. That’s what I’ve always believed.

On Tuesday in Paris one group of bullying Chelsea supporters screamed and shouted and showed how racist they were.

Seeing and hearing these cowards chanting ‘We’re racist! We’re racist!’ to one lonesome black guy made my blood boil. All I kept thinking was: I hope these guys get some payback.

'I never played in front of racist Chelsea fans...That Chelsea was dead and buried decades ago'

Gary Lineker, presenter and ex footballer: 'Just saw the video of the Chelsea mob's deplorable behaviour and racist chants. Sickening, embarrassing, moronic, disgraceful.'

Paul Canoville, Chelsea's first ever black footballer: 'I watched it and I was in disgust, I was so angry and ashamed. We’ve done so much campaigning against the very issue of racism and this happens and it’s brought it all right back down. I don’t care if it’s the minority because regardless of that it is connected to the club and when you mention Chelsea this will be the response. I can’t believe this has come about.' 

Stan Collymore, pundit and ex footballer: 'Chelsea fans. Save your spite for those on the train, I'm sure you'll want to see them banned from holding season tickets at your club.'

Jason Roberts, pundit and ex footballer: 'I hope that every black Chelsea Player watches that.'

Sepp Blatter, FIFA president: 'I also condemn the actions of a small group of Chelsea fans in Paris. There is no place for racism in football.'

Ian Wright, pundit and ex footballer: 'Chelsea what you gonna do? Your club has been linked to racism for so long! What have you done? Put a couple of signs up in your ground? Those guys on the train remind me of my childhood. Chase you with their mates! But when alone and confronted, I've seen them cry.'  

I was disgusted to see such behaviour. It was like I was going back in time and watching a documentary about the old Chelsea fans; the old Chelsea fans that were racist, the Chelsea fans that used to give their own players racist abuse.

It was always difficult to picture the Chelsea fans I played for being the same racist Chelsea fans who gave their own players Paul Canoville and Keith Dublin such grief and abuse.

I never played in front of racist Chelsea fans at Stamford Bridge or anywhere when I wore the Chelsea shirt. That old racist Chelsea was before my time. That Chelsea was dead and buried decades ago.

The club has done all it can to kill that image and now it is very much a multicultural club.

But maybe this is something that Roman Abramovich’s millions can’t buy.

I kept thinking to myself: how do the minds of these racist guys work?

A few hours later these same men were cheering on their Chelsea team, with two black guys in the starting line-up - Willian and Ramires.

Did they cheer for them? Or did they get angry that these two were wearing the Chelsea shirt?

Did these same racist idiots not cheer with the rest of the Chelsea fans when Didier Drogba scored that penalty in Munich?

Was the club’s greatest triumph tarnished because a black man scored the winning goal? 

Did these fans used to hate me as a black man wearing the blue of Chelsea?

Only they can answer those questions. I can’t even begin to try to translate the thought process of a racist.

Honestly, I find it all disgusting and hope they all get locked away. Extreme, I know, but surely let’s make an example of them — of racists.

Chelsea, the FA, FIFA and any other footballing governing body need to come up with a plan to eliminate these thugs from our game and society.

Not just a poster campaign, or wristbands or even a fancy advert, but a proper campaign with proper consequences and proper punishment for those guilty.

Chelsea need to clean up their own house with these fans and do their own in-house justice to make sure they are identified and make the punishment radical.

Disassociation alone is not enough — there has to be a huge message for all to see.

I know those cowards do not represent all Chelsea fans but unfortunately they did in Paris and brought shame on the club.

Chelsea are my team and have been ever since I signed as a schoolboy more than 25 years ago, so I feel the highs and lows like all Chelsea supporters.

I will defend them in debates about everything but what happened on Tuesday in Paris was indefensible. I didn’t even try to.

In many discussions I heard in the aftermath there was talk I should be ashamed to be a Chelsea fan.

I’m not ashamed to be a Chelsea fan and I am not ashamed over what happened in Paris as those racist idiots do not represent ME but I am very saddened at what those mindless idiots have done to the image of my Chelsea.
