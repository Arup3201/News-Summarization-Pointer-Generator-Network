Mary Berry has said that children should be banned from bringing mobile phones and electronic games to the dinner table.

The Great British Bake Off judge believes that the move could help combat the obesity crisis.

Mrs Berry, 79, enforces what she dubs a 'Downing Street rule' in her own home and asks visiting children – as well as her children and grandchildren – to hand in their gadgets before dinner.

She said: 'The first thing to do is to sit down, and the second is to take every mechanical aid off the table.

'When the children and grandchildren come to see me, they hand in all their games and phones at the door. I call it 'the Downing Street rule', because that's what they make you do if you go to No 10.

'If people could just do those two things, learn to enjoy smaller portions and not eat between meals, I really think it would help combat obesity.' 

The bestselling food writer and TV presenter said it is essential for young people to be educated about what they eat and that obesity is one of the 'worst problems' facing the country today.

She uses a mobile for texting her children, but does not use Twitter  like her Bake Off co-star Paul Hollywood

She said she uses a mobile phone for texting her children, but – unlike her Bake Off co-star Paul Hollywood – does not indulge in social media.

When asked whether she had adopted the modern habit of taking 'selfies', she added: 'Certainly not. But people seem to want me to do one with them all the time and I'm completely baffled.

'Presumably they all want to tweet it and say, 'I've just met Mary Berry'.'

Mrs Berry told Glamour magazine about her concerns over young people's relationship with food, saying the 'whole thinness thing is very, very worrying'. 

She called for young women to be offered normal role models in fashion and the media, adding: 'But the worst problem of all in this country is obesity. 

'It's so important for the young to be educated about what they eat.'

Mrs Berry has previously called for better lessons for schoolchildren, saying all pupils should be taught to make ten basic, healthy meals before they leave school.

Speaking at the Cheltenham Literature Festival last year, she said teachers should go back to showing young people 'what's good for them, how to buy it and how to make a few dishes that they and enjoy and don't cost too much'.
