Touch screen devices may soon become the norm in classrooms as schools are increasingly moving away from traditional learning methods by using tablets instead.

A national survey has found that students as young as five from schools across Australia are using devices like iPads to enhance their education.

While one expert says it is important to adapt to the way technology has changed children's learning, studies have found that 60 per cent of students are being exposed to more than the recommended two hours screen time each day.

This can impact the child's development of fundamental skills as well as their sleeping patterns.

Current paediatric recommendations and guidelines from the Australian Department of Health suggest screen based media use should be limited to less than two hours per day, according to a report by researchers from the University of Western Australia.

The report found an average of 63 per cent of the surveyed 2,620 children exceeded the recommended guidelines of less than two hours.

A breakdown shows that 45 per cent of children aged eight spend more than two hours of screen time each day while 80 per cent of 15 to 16 year olds surpass the recommended hours per week day.

But child learning expert Kristy Goodwin isn't too fazed by the hours specifically but is more concerned about how these devices are used effectively.

'It all comes down to how the device is used,' Dr Goodwin told Daily Mail Australia.

'If devices are used appropriately it can really enhance children's learning.

'But they shouldn't be used as digital babysitters at schools, which is often the case for parents who use these devices to pacify children.

'Like anything in life, if it is used excessively it will have a negative effect.'

Dr Goodwin, a Macquarie University academic and director of Every Chance to Learn, further supports the increasing use of electronic devices and screen time at primary schools, as long as teachers are properly trained - which often isn't the case. 

'Children today are digital natives,' she said.

'Young children should be encouraged to use tablets as emerging research and evidence shows that it can be a great learning tool in the classroom.

'Technology is also changing children's predisposition and their expectations of learning and they're craving visual information and processing visuals before text.

'But the problem is that all of a sudden, teachers are expected to know how to teach effectively using devices but are not given the right training for it and this is critical if we want to enhance the learning of young students.'

A survey of 1267 Australian schools last year found that 27 per cent have implemented the Bring Your Own Dedicated Device strategy, which has increased from 19 per cent in 2013.

The BYODD program, which urges students to bring tablets to school, include primary school students from ages five to 12.

The Softlink 2014 Australian School Library Survey, which is due to be released next week, also shows that 12 per cent of schools that have a BYODD strategy are for primary education.

What also troubles Dr Goodwin is that children's development of fundamental skills like handwriting may be affected as well as their sleeping patterns.

'What's concerning is that by exposing children to tablets they often don't develop the same kind of fundamental skills like handwriting and there's also impact on sleep as the use of these devices may affect sleep depth and sleeping patterns,' she said. 

'But if children are given a task on tablets it increases their engagement and motivation to complete the exercise. 

'Society is going digital so I think it's our moral imperative to use technology in our classrooms and look at right ways to use it as an effective learning tool.

'Banning it at schools purely because we fear the use of devices is not the right thing to be doing.' 

The Department of Health recommends that children under the age of two should not spend any time using electronic devices - that includes tablets.

For ages two to five, they should be limited to less than an hour each day.

Infants, toddlers and pre-schoolers should not be sedentary, restrained or kept inactive for more than one hour at a time with the exception of sleeping. 

Children aged five to 12 should use limit their use for less than two hours per day.
