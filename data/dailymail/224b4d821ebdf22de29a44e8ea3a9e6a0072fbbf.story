The parents of an 11-year-old Mexican boy who recently had portions of a watermelon-sized tumor removed will be allowed to stay in the U.S. while he receives treatment, authorities have confirmed.

Federal immigration officials have granted Cindy and Jose Ramirez Sr. - the mother and father of Jose  Serrano - extended humanitarian visas after New Mexico Governor, Susana Martinez, sent a request.

In a letter last week to Homeland Security, Martinez asked the federal authorities to expedite the couple's visas because they were important to their son's recovery.

She wrote that they 'are a constant presence in Jose's small world inside the hospital and represent what is likely the only 'normal' things he experiences in the otherwise unfamiliar setting of a hospital in a country not his own.'

Last month, a team of more than 25 medics from the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque expunged a third of the massive tumor from Jose during an 11-hour surgery.

Doctors say he will need months of physical therapy, followed by more surgeries.

Jose of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, was diagnosed with venous lymphangioma on his shoulder in 2012.

The cystic growth, which was rough to touch, extended across his shoulder and caused restricted movement.

He could not swim because the water caused him pain and playing sports was difficult.

‘It's been difficult,’ his mother explained before the mass was removed. ‘People stare at him. Some of them have these terrible, morbid looks on their faces.'

When Jose was born with the growth doctors were concerned he wouldn't live, but he went on to make a stable recovery.

However, as the mass continued to grow there was concern it could one day spread to his eyes and affect his vision.

Doctors at the University of New Mexico Hospital told Jose that he had to undergo a series of surgeries and treatments to remove the huge fluid build up.

In July 2012, U.S. Homeland Security Investigations assisted in picking up the boy and his parents from a neighborhood in Ciudad Juarez - one of the deadliest cities in the world due to drug cartels.

Federal agents helped the family seek care for Jose after First Baptist Church of Rio Rancho members saw him during a missionary visit.

After stories and images of the boy went viral, First Baptist Church officials reported a jump in donations to help him raise money for the surgeries, which cost more than $200,000.

Martinez then got involved and sought an extended visa for the boy to receive treatment in New Mexico.

His family had been traveling back and forth to visit while the boy stays with a staff member of the church.
