The Royal Navy’s first female warship commander is facing the sack over claims of an on-board affair with one of her crewmates.

While the alleged affair is being investigated, Sarah West, 42, will retain her position as commander of HMS Portland.

If the claims against her are proven, Commander West could face a formal warning, reassignment or even termination of her two decades of Navy service.

The male officer, whose identity is unknown, may also face disciplinary action.

The Ministry of Defence has refused to disclose whether he has retained his responsibilities or if he, too, has been removed from the ship. It is not known if he is married.

Cdr West became the first woman to take charge of a frontline warship in the Navy’s 500-year history in 2012.

When she was promoted, Cdr West revealed that her job had damaged her marriage to Navy helicopter pilot Andrew Whitlum – which broke down in 2006 – saying: ‘My husband used to be in the Navy and all that time apart is a challenge.

‘People who prosper in the armed forces tend to put their job as the priority, which isn’t the best thing for a happy married life.’

But despite sacrificing her relationship to focus on her trailblazing role, Cdr West, from Grimsby, is now facing the prospect of losing her job on HMS Portland, after allegedly having an affair with a male officer under her command.

Her 43-year-old ex-husband now has a son with his new partner in Dorset, where he flies a search and rescue helicopter for the coastguard.

Yesterday the pilot insisted he had nothing to say about his former wife, who earlier this year claimed that her job left her unable to hold down a relationship.

Cdr West, who does not have children, said in an earlier interview: ‘Years at sea probably explains why I’m single.’

Name: HMS Portland

Operator: Royal Navy

Ordered: February 1996

Builder: Marconi Marine,

Sponsored by: Lady Heather Brigstocke

Homeport: HMNB Devonport, Plymouth

Length: 133 m (436 ft 4 in)

Beam: 16.1 m (52 ft 10 in)

Draught: 7.3 m (23 ft 9 in)

Speed: In excess of 28 kn (52 km/h; 32 mph)

She even joked that she should advertise her mobile number ‘to get a date’.

However if the allegations are true, she started seeing a subordinate during the seven-month tour of her frigate, which has been conducting anti-narcotics patrols in the Caribbean.

This would breach the Armed Forces’ Code of Social Conduct, which prohibits personnel from relationships which compromise ‘operational effectiveness’.

Yesterday former head of the Navy Admiral Lord West, who is not related to the captain, said: ‘If she had a relationship with someone under her command then she’s rather let down other women in the Royal Navy, because there are people who will jump on this and say this is why women shouldn’t be on ship.’

He added: ‘The rules banning relationships in the chain of command exist for a very good reason. If the allegations are true I doubt Commander West will continue in her post or be given another ship to command.’

A Royal Navy spokesman said: ‘We are aware of an allegation of a breach of the Code of Social Conduct which we are treating seriously. It would be inappropriate to comment further.’
