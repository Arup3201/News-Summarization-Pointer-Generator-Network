Oscar Pistorius was last night due to hold a private memorial service for the girlfriend he shot dead.

The South African Paralympic athlete, 26, who denies murdering Reeva Steenkamp, 29, earlier this month and claims he mistook her for an intruder in his home, has been free on bail since last Friday.

The service came as it was reported Desmond Nair, the Pretoria Magistrate's Court chief magistrate who presided over the bail hearing, was in mourning after his relative killed herself and her children.

In mourning: Friends and family arrived to pay their respects at Arnold Pistorius house in Pretoria, South Africa, where Oscar has been since he was released on bail, as a memorial service was held for Reeva Steenkamp

Confirmation of the service to be held
at the house of Pistorius’s uncle Arnold in Pretoria, where he has been
staying since his release on bail, came after a leak in the media, 
reported Sky News.

A family statement said: ‘Since it 
is such a sensitive issue, Oscar has asked for a private service with 
people who share his loss, including his family members who knew and 
loved Reeva.’

The announcement came as it was 
revealed the athlete has asked for his bail conditions to be altered so 
he can restart training. His trial is expected to take place later this 
year.

Meanwhile, the bodies of a woman 
related to Mr Nair and her two sons were found on Sunday evening at 
their Johannesburg home by her ex-husband, police warrant officer Balan 
Muthan said.

Authorities suspect the woman 
administered a substance that killed her children, and took her own life
by ingesting it as well. 'I can confirm the deceased is my first 
cousin,' Mr Nair said.

The woman's brother, Vishal Maharaj, 
identified her as Anusha Maharaj. Police said Maharaj was her family 
name before she married. South African media identified her as Anusha 
Mooljee.

Pistorius family statement

Mr Muthan said police suspect 'she 
took her own life by ingesting a substance that killed her', and that 
she 'most probably' gave the same substance to her children.

Autopsies were conducted yesterday and
toxicologists were analysing the substance believed to have killed the 
three family members.

Suicide notes were found and a murder 
investigation was underway, Mr Muthan said. He said copies of the notes 
were admitted as evidence in the probe and declined to comment on the 
contents.

South African media outlet Eyewitness 
News said the boys who died were 12 and 17 years old and cited neighbour
Claire Osment as saying she rushed outside after hearing screams coming
from the townhouse where they lived.

Pretoria chief magistrate Desmond Nair, who presided over the Pistorius bail hearing in Pretoria, South Africa, is in private mourning, reports said

Pistorius is staying at the home of his uncle Arnold, right, while he is on bail and planning to hold the memorial there. Arnold is pictured here comforting his niece Aimee

'We asked what happened. The dad just 
said, "She has killed my boys." He was just crying,' Eyewitness News 
quoted her as saying. ‘He couldn't believe it, he couldn't believe that 
his sons are gone.'

Mr Nair, 44, has presided over a 
number of high-profile cases, including the 2008 conviction on fraud 
charges of Sydney Maree, a South African who took American citizenship 
and became a track star in the U.S.

He also presided over a 2011 plea 
agreement in which rugby player Bees Roux received a five-year suspended
prison sentence for the beating death of a policeman, and inquiries 
into alleged misconduct by magistrates around South Africa.

On Friday, Mr Nair delivered a lengthy
discourse on why he was granting bail to Pistorius, including an 
assertion that prosecutors had not argued persuasively that the 
Paralympian was a flight risk.

Charged: Carl Pistorius, with sister Aimee, in court to see their brother Oscar granted bail after being charged with murdering his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp

Mr Nair criticised shortcomings in the
state's investigation, but he also said aspects of Pistorius' account 
of what happened were not convincing.

Pistorius says he killed Miss 
Steenkamp accidentally, opening fire after mistaking her for an intruder
in his home. Prosecutors alleged he intentionally shot her after the 
couple had an argument.

Last week, the chief investigator in 
the case against Pistorius, Hilton Botha, was removed from the inquiry 
after it was revealed that attempted murder charges against him had been
reinstated in early February.

The charges relate to a 2011 incident in which Botha and two other police officers allegedly fired on a minibus.

In another surprise, a lawyer for the 
Pistorius family said on Sunday that Oscar's brother, Carl, faces a 
charge of unlawful, negligent killing for a 2008 road death. That charge
had also been dropped and later reinstated.
