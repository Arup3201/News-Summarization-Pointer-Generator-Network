A teenager who raped a six-year-old schoolboy has been jailed for five years.

The 16-year-old from South Tyneside was convicted at Newcastle Crown Court of two charges of rape, relating to one incident last year.

The teenage attacker, who cannot be named, denied his guilt, which meant the young victim had to give evidence at a trial.

Judge Brian Forster QC said the youth 
must sign the sex offenders register for life and abide by the terms of a
 sexual offences prevention order for the next ten years.

The court heard that, just months after the sickening rape attack, the boy was convicted of having sex with an underage girl.

Judge Forster said the sex attacker, who was just 15 at the time of the offence, knew exactly what he was doing when he attacked the young boy.

The judge said: ‘The circumstances were fully considered by the jury during the course of the trial. I had the opportunity to assess you during the course of the trial and I am quite sure you knew what you were doing was very wrong.

'You took advantage of him for your own sexual satisfaction'

Judge Brian Forster QC

‘You took advantage of him for your own sexual satisfaction. It is important to keep in mind that the long-term impact of this type of offending on a young victim is unknown.

'I noted the way which you answered questions and it is clear to me you knew that what you were doing was very wrong.’

David Callan, defending, said the attacker - who has poor school attendance - has become a hate target and was recently in hospital after an assault. He added that the boy was immature for his age.
