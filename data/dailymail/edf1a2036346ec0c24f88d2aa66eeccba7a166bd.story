An eight-month-old baby girl from New Jersey has become the sixth infant in the country to die in a Nap Nanny Recliner.

The child, from Hopatcong, was secured by a belt and was found partly hanging over the side of baby-napping device, trapped between the recliner and a crib bumper.

The U.S. Consumer and Product Safety Commission is urging parents and caregivers to stop using the Nap Nanny and Nap Nanny Chill Recliners immediately as a result of the girl’s death, although the item was recalled last summer.

The prduct was pulled from shelves last June after 92 incidents, including five infant deaths dating back to 2009. The recall was voluntary, however.

The Nap Nanny was designed to mimic the curves of a baby car seat, elevating an infant slightly to help reduce reflux, gas, stuffiness or other problems.

The dangers of the product are when the baby gets trapped or when the baby suffocates on the inside of the product.

'This is a product that should be out of homes and we urge all parents to stop using the product,' said U.S. Consumer and Product Safety Commission spokesman Scott Wolfson.

Wolfson said before the recall, 165,000 units had been sold. The danger now comes on the second hand market.

'Don’t sell it at a garage sale. Don’t take it back to a local thrift store. Don’t put it on eBay or Craigslist. Just throw it away,' he said.

Officials believe that parents and caregivers are still picking up the hazardous products from yard sales, online auction sites or using them as hand-me-down gifts.

Parents should be aware that once a product is officially recalled, it is illegal to sell or resell them.The products were already voluntarily recalled at the end of 2012 by Amazon.com, Babies R Us, Buy Buy Baby, Diapers.com, and Toys R Us.

Consumers purchasing the items from other retailers have been urged 'to immediately dispose of the products to ensure that they are not used again,' by the agency.
