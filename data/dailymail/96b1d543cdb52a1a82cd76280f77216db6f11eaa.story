Victoria Beckham has never been short on 'girl power' and now the pop star-turned-fashion designer has been heralded as one of the most inspirational woman of her generation.

The mother-of-four topped an illustrious list of women who 'inspire, empower and game-change' within the fashion industry.

She saw off style royalty including Kate Moss, Stella McCartney and Mary Portas, in the survey by Grazia magazine, to be voted most inspirational woman in fashion.

In 2006 the former Spice Girl launched her own denim label, which she followed with  a sunglasses range in 2008.

After appearing in a Marc Jacobs campaign she  launched her label to a handful of fashion insiders in New York, and won rave reviews from her most sceptical of critics. 

Since then her  designs have been worn by Oprah Winfrey, Sarah Jessica Parker and Gwyneth Paltrow.

The publication has released the results of its reader poll, published to celebrate the magazine's tenth anniversary.

Editor-in-chief  Jane Bruton said that Victoria's tenacity and hard work made her a worthy winner. 

She said: 'Ten years ago, we knew Victoria as a Spice Girl and one half of an A-list power couple. She made no secret of her love for fashion but was known for wearing, not creating it.

'The thought of Victoria as a credible fashion designer seemed outlandish but boy did we underestimate her. 

'Last year she won British Entrepreneur of the Year at the British Fashion Awards and opened her first store in London. Through sheer hard graft and business clout, VB has become a great fashion designer.'

Girls' Lena Dunham was voted most influential woman in culture, beating off competition from the likes of JK Rowling, Hilary Mantel, Katherine Bigelow and Oprah Winfrey.

The politics category saw 17-year-old schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai heralded; the UK-based student was the youngest ever recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 for her campaigning work for the rights of the education of girls in her native Pakistan. 

Self-made millionaire Zoe Sugg, 24, aka Zoella, was named most influential woman in technology.
