The fourth alleged victim of a Republican businessman told the court today that he hit then raped her twice after taking her to his remote cabin.

Gregory Nathan Peterson, 37, faces multiple charges of rape, kidnap and sexual abuse of women he lured on dates.

The 34-year-old woman was the final witness at Peterson's two-day preliminary hearing in Salt Lake City, Utah to decide whether there is enough evidence for him to stand trial.

It was also revealed that she had met with the third alleged victim, who testified yesterday. The women found out that Peterson had made them both watch TV show Big Love - an HBO series about a polygamist with three wives.

Similar to the earlier witnesses, the fourth women said she met the Republican campaigner at a Mormon singles event, hosted by the LDS church, in March last year.

She agreed to go on a date with him to the movies. However when they got into his truck, she told the court, he said he had a gun and ordered her to stroke his genitals and kiss his neck. When her tooth touched his skin, he slapped her.

Peterson then drove the alleged victim to his cabin and played the HBO series before pushing her onto the bed and raping her, while saying: 'Tell me you’d be one of my wives', according to court details from the Salt Lake Tribune.

The next day, the woman said Peterson dropped her at her car. She then drove to a friend's house and called the police.

An examination showed she suffered vaginal and anal bleeding along with lacerations.

Another woman sobbed in court on Tuesday as she told how 
she was kidnapped and repeatedly raped by Peterson, in a prolonged ordeal she described as 'torture'.

Three women faced their alleged attacker in court on Tuesday. The
 third woman to take the stand said she had met Peterson on Facebook in 
June this year and the pair had messaged each other until he invited her
 to a barbecue at his cabin in Heber City on July 1.

After having little contact with the woman at the event at his home, he called her the next day to ask her to a movie.

The woman began shaking on the stand 
and refused to look at the accused as she said that Peterson, who she 
described as a 'monster', first became physical with her in the movie 
theater.

The
 woman, who is originally from Brazil, said Peterson claimed to be a 
powerful politician, then threatened to have her deported after he had 
checked up on her status and found she was in the U.S. illegally.

Peterson,
 of Orem, had previously let her know that he kept a gun in the glove 
compartment of his car. The GOP activist then drove the woman to his 
cabin where he verbally abused her before exposing himself to her and 
sexually abusing her.

According to the Desert News, she told the court: 'He would flip me over and would change positions like I was an object and he could do whatever he wanted. I was afraid of his aggression and violence.'

The businessman refused to let the woman go instead driving her to his mother's house in Lewiston where he forced her to work for free while making threats. She was kept at the home from July 3 to July 5.

The victim said that she accompanied Peterson to various places without trying to escape because she felt so threatened and that he had told her he 'could make her disappear'. He finally released her after two days.

Peterson sat in court and listened intently to each 
woman's testimony, at times becoming animated and at one point 
interrupting a prosecutor.

Two other women who spoke in court said that they had met Peterson on Mormon dating website LDSsingles.com.

One woman arranged a date with Peterson on April 21, explaining that he looked like 'a great catch' in his profile and had come recommended by a Mormon temple.

After a lunch date, the woman explained she had to leave, causing Peterson to become enraged, she said in her testimony. He followed her to her car to apologize and then followed her home.

Feeling threatened, she allowed him into her home where he took her to the bedroom and began to touch her before exposing himself. Worried that he would become 'too angry', the woman finally managed to get him out of her home, she told the court.

The final witness on Tuesday said she had also been attracted to his dating profile and agreed to a movie date with Peterson on December 10.

The following day, he came to her home in West Jordan to take her to lunch but immediately carried her into the living room and lay on top of her on the couch, pulling up her skirt to sexually assault her.

The woman told the court she repeatedly asked him to stop which he finally did but refused to leave her home until they had lunch.

She attended hospital but said she hesitated to come forward with her story because 'he knew where she lived'. Several days later, the woman went to police to say she wanted to press charges.

She reportedly waited two months for the West Jordan police department to return her calls but was discouraged by a detective because the case would be her word against Peterson's.

West Jordan police department told MailOnline that they would never tell anyone not to press charges related to a sexual assault.

A spokesman said that they worked with officers to make sure they were sensitive to victims' feelings.

In general, the officer said that cases involving sexual allegations tended to be complicated but that they were sorry that any victim felt they had been discouraged.

Five women in total have alleged Peterson raped or sexually assaulted them. The GOP stalwart has been 
accused of attacks going back to April 2010 when one woman said he took 
her to his remote cabin for lunch and insisted they watch a movie.

He 
then tried to kiss her and when she told him to stop, he exposed his 
genitals. The mother managed to escape the lodge in Heber, Utah after showing Peterson that she had a holstered gun.

The judge will decide whether he will stand trial on 23 charges including rape, assault and kidnapping based on evidence heard at the two-day hearing.

Defense attorney Cara Tangaro said that she would present information at Peterson's hearing 'about the strength, or lack thereof, of this case'.

Peterson has been held on $750,000 bail at Salt Lake County jail since July 18.

Peterson often used his cabin to hold Republican events which were attended by the GOP elite including Senator Orrin Hatch, Governor Gary Herbert, Representative Jason Chaffetz and congressional candidate Mia Love.

The 37-year-old accountant has been deeply involved in GOP events in Utah. After receiving an MBA at Brigham 
Young University, he went on to set up Peterson Wealth Management and 
online trading site smartstocks.com.

He
 used his business connections to organize the Rocky Mountain 
Conservatives Convention 2010 at his log cabin in Heber, which is 
surrounded by three large reservoirs.

Accused: Peterson is due to appear in court today in Salt Lake City where it will be decided if he is to be tried on 23 charges including rape, assault and kidnapping 

Three more women have also come forward to say that they were abused by Peterson but no charges have been filed although public prosecutors were not ruling it out.

GOP members had distanced themselves from Peterson since the allegations emerged.

Emails to the Utah Republican Party by MailOnline went unanswered.

Shortly after Peterson was charged in July, one female acquaintance, who met the 37-year-old at a Mormon church singles event, said he had aggressively pursued her to go to his cabin.

Haley Hayes told KLS: 'He really did corner me for an hour and a half. I know the situation those girls were in and I can't even imagine.'

Peterson is due back in court on August 29.
