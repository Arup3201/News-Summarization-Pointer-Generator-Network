New Yorkers have one of the longest commutes in the nation, according to a new report.

The study by the nonprofit Partnership for New York City found that commuters in the Big Apple spend an average 48 minutes getting to and from work. That's nearly 23 minutes longer than the average commute in the U.S., according to U.S.Census figures.

The sheer magnitude of people flowing in and out of Manhattan every day is largely to blame for the city's lengthy commute.

Commuters wait for their trains to be called at Penn Station in New York. A study by the nonprofit Partnership for New York City found that commuters in the Big Apple spend an average 48 minutes getting to and from work

New Yorkers wait in traffic as they head into Manhattan from Brooklyn. Manhattan doubles its population every work day with 1.5 million commuters

The borough doubles its population every work day with 1.5 million commuters - which is more than the populations of Phoenix, Dallas and San Francisco combined, the report points out. More than one third of those commuters are traveling from other states, while the majority come from the other four boroughs.Â 

By comparison, roughly 150,000 commuters travel between Queens and Brooklyn every day. That's a much smaller number than the amount traveling to and from Manhattan, but it's more than enough to clog the bus, train, and especially road routes between the two boroughs.

The report says more than half of commuters between Brooklyn and Queens have to drive because of 'limited' public transit options. To ease congestion along those routes, the report recommends increasing bus service between the two boroughs.

The report also recommends that new businesses consider locating in boroughs outside of Manhattan. Brooklyn has seen a 24 percent increase in the number of people who both live and work there over the past decade thanks to a boom in new businesses there.

Similarly, the Bronx has seen a 28 percent jump in the number of people who commute there for work. 'But the borough still has a lot to do before becoming a jobs center,' the report notes. 'For every one person who commutes into the Bronx for work, four people commute out, indicating a lack of job opportunities.'

The Partnership for New York City describes itself as a 'nonprofit membership organization comprised of a select group of two hundred CEOs from New York City's top corporate, investment and entreprenurial firms.'

The organization says its goal is to stimulate the city's economy by contributing directly to jobs programs and serving disadvantaged communities.
