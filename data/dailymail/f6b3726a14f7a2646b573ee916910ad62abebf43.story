They say good looks run in the family and Abbey Clancy and her mother Karen are clear proof of that in their new campaign.

Abbey, 27, has been unveiled as the new face of Avon fragrance and invited her 53-year-old mother to star alongside her.

The mother-daughter-duo look more like sisters in the new promotional images for the fragrance, Cherish, which launches just in time for Mother's Day.

Sharing her excitement at working with her mother, Abbey said: 'I'm delighted to be the face of Cherish and I have been so lucky to share the experience with my mum. 

'We had such a laugh on the shoot and it will be a memory we'll always cherish.'

Abbey joins an impressive roster of faces at the beauty house, which already counts Megan Fox, Olivia Wilde and Maria Sharapova as ambassadors.

Speaking about promoting the  £14 fragrance, which is floral with notes of jasmine, sandalwood and musk, Abbey added: 'I am so proud to be working with Avon as it's amazing to be able to partner with a company that empowers women in so many ways.

'To front this scent is a dream - it's stunning. It's so versatile and long-lasting, taking me from the school run to the red carpet - it really is the perfect scent to celebrate every side of you as a woman. Pete loves it too.'

Good looks run in the family: Abbey recently admitted that she's lucky to be blessed with good genes, describing her mother as a 'goddess'

The mother and daughter campaign stars are firm friends and Abbey often invites Karen to accompany her at showbiz parties.

Referring to Karen shortly after the birth of her own daughter in 2011, Abbey said: 'I weigh less than I weighed before I had the baby and I'm really happy with my figure.

'I'm lucky to be blessed with good genes. My mum is 51 and hasn't had any work done, but still looks like she could be my sister. She's a goddess.' 

Clearly feeling the love for her family this week, Abbey yesterday expressed her devotion to her husband Peter Crouch by sharing a heart-warming picture on Instagram of him cuddling their three-year-old daughter Sophia on Sunday evening.

The sweet black-and-white snap shows the Stoke City striker lying on their wooden floor with their little girl lying on top of him and laughing.

The 28-year-old model proudly added the caption, 'My world', alongside the Instagram picture when she shared it with her 335k Twitter followers. 

This Avon campaign is the latest in a string of successes for the model and WAG, who also designs a range for Matalan and was unveiled as the face of Veet and Scholl earlier this year.
