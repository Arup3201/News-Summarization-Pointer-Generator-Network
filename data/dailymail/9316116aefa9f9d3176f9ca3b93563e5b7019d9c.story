The team call themselves the 'Barrister Hottie Experts'

First, there was the boys - a list of the best looking male barristers in Britain.

Now, here come the girls.

In the interest of equality, the two American women behind the idea to list the 21 most attractive male lawyers in the country have released a list of best looking female barristers.

Included on the list of 'hotties' is Justine Thornton, wife of Labour party leader Ed Miliband

Top of the list of 'hottest female barristers' is international and human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin, of Doughty St chambers

Writing on yourbarristerboyfriend, the
 team - calling themselves the Barrister Hottie Experts - said: 'After 
the enthusiastic response to our debut Male Barrister Hottie list, we 
thought long and hard about what to do next.

'The answer seemed clear. Avoiding women would just be too easy - and perhaps even sexist.

'We had some reservations. Because women are still judged on their appearance on a daily basis, they don’t particularly need anything else to remind them of our lookist society.

'Or so the argument goes. But we don’t like the idea that women barristers, unlike men, are not powerful enough to withstand a hottie list. We didn’t believe that this would destroy the legal profession, as some Chicken Littles predicted. Plus, we think we have excellent taste in women.'

Included on the list of 'hotties' is Justine Thornton, wife of Labour party leader Ed Miliband.

She is praised for her 'earnest swot look' nut mainly for putting up with her husband's 'adenoidal patter every day.'

Top of the list is international and human rights lawyer Amal Alamuddin, of Doughty St chambers.

Marianne Butler (left) is number two, and described as 'ferociously intelligent', and (right) Sri Carmichael of Hardwicke chambers, is in at number three, and is 'even more beautiful in the flesh'

The 'breathtakingly beautiful' Miss Alamuddin represented Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, in his fight against extradition, the Telegraph reports.

The list's creators said: 'Not only does she have huge warm eyes and silky, jet-black hair, but she speaks French and Arabic.'

Marianne Butler is number two, and described as 'ferociously intelligent with a first from Oxford (PPE), a cornucopia of prizes and a glittering career at Fountain Court [chambers] where she keeps all the male hotties on their toes.'

Siobhan Grey, of Doughty Street chambers, is entered at number four. 
Her entry reads: 'If you had been born in 1850s, you might have been  discovered by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and made to sit for hours in a medieval dress'

Laura Newton (11 Stone Buildings). The bloggers write: 'Oh Laura, you lovely English rose, even your name is quintessentially British'

Elizabeth Nartey, of Argent Chambers, is 'obviously stunning', but 'also has the kind of face that exudes kindness, warmth and sincerity'

Also on the list are Gemma White (Blackstone Chambers left and Laura Bell (Devereux Chambers) right

The fun and fantastically smart Rachel Oakeshott (left) and  fabulous Angharad Start (right)

Sri Carmichael of Hardwicke chambers, is in 
at number three.

The accompanying entry reads: 'According to her admirers, she is ‘even more beautiful in 
the flesh’, ‘charming and super bright’, and ‘tall with an incredible 
supermodel figure’.'

Siobhan Grey, of Doughty Street chambers, is entered at number four.

Her entry reads: 'If you had been born in 1850s, you might have been 
‘discovered’ by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and made to sit for hours in a 
medieval dress, fingering a lute for a series of languorous, slightly 
lascivious portraits.

'But here you are today, fighting white collar 
fraud and defending freedom of expression.'

'English Rose' Laura Newton of 11 Stone Buildings is number 5.

They write: 'Can we ask you if anyone has compared you to the young Marianne Faithfull?  We see you bicycling down a Reading country lane in 1964 with your blonde hair blowing in the wind and your big periwinkle eyes dreaming of London.

'There you acquire a black velvet dress with a white collar and a pair of boots from Mary Quant’s Bazaar, and become the ‘it girl’ of the swinging sixties.

'Oh wait, this is 2013 and women are more than dolly birds and muses. You are in fact a very serious professional woman who speaks German, French and a bit of Mandarin. You’re just lucky enough to still look like a winsome schoolgirl.'

Elizabeth Nartey, of Argent Chambers, is 'obviously stunning', but 'also has the kind of face that exudes kindness, warmth and sincerity', Shaheed Fatima, of Blackstone chambers has 'beautiful eyes 
and such a calm, knowing smile' and Sophie Wellings, of 39 Essex 
Street chambers, 'an angelic, dewy-eyed nymph' and claisscially trained soprano.

The women had originally tried to keep their identities secret but have now been revealed as author and historian  Natalia Naish, 31, and former Time magazine writer Sonia Van Gilder Cooke, 30.

Miss Cooke told the Telegraph that reaction the lists had been almost entirely positive.

She said: 'We haven’t put anyone on who doesn’t want to be there and we have not included pupils, who can be in a vulnerable position as they are not so established,' she said.

The pair are welcoming suggestions for inclusion in the women’s list, and have also launched a male ‘hottie of the week’.
