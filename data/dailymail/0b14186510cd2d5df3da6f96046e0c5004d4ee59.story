A New Jersey woman recently named a county's teacher of the year was in court Wednesday to answer charges that she had sex with a 15-year-old boy enrolled in an honors class she taught.

An attorney for Erica DePalo, 33, of Montclair, entered a not guilty plea on her behalf during a hearing in Superior Court in Newark.

DePalo faces aggravated sexual assault, sexual assault and child endangerment charges.

Sacked: Erica DePalo has been suspended indefinitely from her post as an honors English teacher after allegedly carrying on an affair with one the students in her class

The boy was in her honors English class and the two carried on what prosecutors described in court documents as a 'sexual relationship' from June until recently.

DePalo has been indefinitely suspended from her job teaching English at West Orange High School, according to school officials.

Her attorney said she had been a teacher for nearly a decade and a career high point came when DePalo was named Essex County's teacher of the year in 2011.

DePalo was accompanied to her Wednesday court appearance by family members. She did not speak during the hearing.

Her attorney, Anthony Alfano, said 
DePalo maintained her innocence and was "extremely grateful for the 
overwhelming amount of support" she had been receiving from other 
teachers and members of the West Orange community since her August 31 
arrest.

The single woman from the town of Montclair is being held at a northern New Jersey lock-up in lieu of $100,000 bail.

'I don’t have any children,' DePalo remarked after winning her award, 'and I always say that I don’t have any children to go home and take care of.

'But every morning and every day that I go to school I have 110 children that are very near-and-dear to my heart.'

Assistant Essex County Prosecutor Gigi Scoles declined to comment on how the case had been brought to the attention of authorities, citing the ongoing investigation.

The allegations belie DePalo's pedigree.

She graduated from Villanova University - a Roman-Catholic college in Philadelphia - with an English degree, before continuing her studies at New York University's Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, where she earned her master's in Liberal Studies.

Officials made counselors available at the high school following the arrest.
