A headteacher has cancelled his schools' nativity because of a poor Ofsted report.

Year 1-6 pupils at the Buswells Lodge Primary in Leicester were told on Wednesday they will no longer be performing their annual Christmas production because the school got a below average rating.

Instead they will be concentrating on 'lessons in numeracy and literacy' after the inspection board said the school 'requires improvement'.

Cancelled: Year 1-6 pupils at Buswells Primary School, Leicester, pictured, will not be taking part in a nativity play because of a poor Ofsted report

The school's head, Ken Judd, said the show would have taken up too much of the pupil's time and added that it was in pupil's 'best interests' not to miss lessons.

Mr Judd said foundation students - around 30 of the youngest pupils in the school aged between three and four - will still be part of a nativity play and all pupils will be attend a festive assembly.

'Best interests': Pupils at the Primary School will concentrate on lessons rather than putting time into the nativity performance

He said: 'Buswells Lodge was graded by Ofsted as 'requires improvement' in March this year.

'As a result, the school is focusing on improving pupils' progress in the core areas of numeracy and literacy.

'For one academic year only, the school has decided not to stage a Christmas production for pupils in years 1-6.

'This is because these pupils would need to miss around half a day's teaching time each week to rehearse in the run-up to the production.

'It is felt that it is in these pupils' best interests to ensure they don't miss this teaching time this year.

'Buswells Lodge school is staging a 
Christmas production for the youngest pupils in the school – the 
foundation stage – and all pupils will be involved in a Christmas 
assembly. 

'Other festive events such as class 
Christmas parties,  a visit from Santa and carol-singing with Leicester 
cathedral choir will also continue as usual.'

The school has 450 pupils aged three to 11.
