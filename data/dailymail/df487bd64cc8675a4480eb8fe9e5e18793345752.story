Trainer Brian Ellison insists Top Notch Tonto lines up in Saturday’s Qipco Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot in as good a form as when second to OIympic Glory last year.

The gelding with distinctive white front legs was a revelation in 2103, a switch to Ellison sparking a rise of over 30lb in his official rating.

Top Notch Tonto finished second to Olympic Glory at Ascot last year

He has yet to win in six runs this year but Ellison has been encouraged by his narrow defeat at York’s Ebor meeting and, especially, a close fourth in the Group Two Boomerang Mile at Irish Champions weekend.

Crucially, the cause of Dale Swift’s mount has been aided by torrential rain which turned Ascot’s going heavy.

Ellison said: ‘The going will be perfect and he is in great form. This race has been the plan since last year and I think he will run as well as he did then.

‘He has put two good races together, and the last one in Ireland on that fast ground was a great run.’

Coral have cut Top Notch Tonto’s odds to 10-1 as punters hone in on proven mudlarks for Ascot like Sprint hope Jack Dexter and Champion Stakes favourite Cirrus Des Aigles.

Jockey AP McCoy needed help removing his saddle at Wetherby on Wednesday

AP McCoy reached 150 winners for the season on Goodwood Mirage but was forced to miss three more successes at Wetherby on Fort Worth, Foundation Man and Presence Felt, who walked over in the novices’ chase, after being stood down by the course doctor.

The champion jockey rode a treble at Huntingdon on Tuesday after returning from a heavy fall at Worcester last week but winced on dismounting Goodwood Mirage and needed help removing his saddle.
