A 35-year-old Nebraska man who is a registered sex offender allegedly forced a female victim to sign a 'slave contract' before torturing her, burning her with cigarettes and lighters and forcing her to drink urine every day.

Nicholas Allen Talbot, of Lincoln, wrote 'PROPERTY OF NICK' on the woman's arm in black marker and told her she 'only had rights the master gave her' after forcing her to sign the contract, which he said was legal.

Police arrested Talbot after the victim - a 32-year-old woman described as 'sweet' and vulnerable' - told her pastor and his wife.

She claims Talbot has been abusing her for almost 10 years, according to The Journal Star.

Sick: Nicholas Allen Talbot, of Lincoln, Nebraska, has been charged with domestic abuse after allegedly enslaving and torturing the 32-year-old victim for almost 10 years. He previously served three years in prison for sexually assaulting a child twice in 1998

However she did not speak out because Talbot threatened to kill her family and made her believe the police were part of his 'gang'.

That is until Monday, when she finally confessed to her pastor, Rev. Kathy Gouin at Lincoln Foursquare Church, and another woman at the church.

She showed the women her wounds.

There were four to six burn marks on the woman's spine that were black, where Talbot had extinguished cigarettes, the victim told police.

Then there were burns on her right buttocks, which Talbot had done with a lighter.

A similar bruise was found on her right breast, where Talbot had put the tip of a heated screwdriver on January 15.

The woman also told investigators Talbot forced her to drink his urine once or twice a day. 

Rev. Goun said the woman's wounds were 'horrific'.

She said she has known the woman through church for about a year and that she had volunteered to take food to the poor.  

'She’s very sweet and innocent,' Gouin said.

'She’s a vulnerable young woman.

'She’s very innocent and believes people.'

Talbot is a registered sex offender. 

He served three years in prison for sexually assaulting a child twice in 1998 and for forgery, according to Nebraska Department of Correctional Services records obtained by The Journal Star.

He was charged with domestic assault on Tuesday and bail was set at $25,000.

He remained behind bars Wednesday.
