A British holidaymaker has been slapped with a £4,000 bill for internet roaming charges after returning from a trip to America.

Robin Baynes, 30, was charged £4,180.83 despite buying a £6 internet bundle deal prior to his two-week trip to the States.

Mr Baynes said Orange had assured him the bundle would cover roaming charges and enable him to access the internet while abroad.

But when he returned home after the trip he found the company had billed him 80 times his usual £50 monthly tariff.

Shocked: Robin Bayne on holiday in America. He returned home to a mobile phone bill of more than £4,000 despite being assured by Orange that his £6 bundle would cover him for roaming charges

Extortionate: The £4,182 bill that Orange sent Mr Bayne. The company has offered to reduce the bill to £500, which he has reluctantly agreed to pay

Mr Baynes, from  Chester-Le Street, County Durham, thought that the £6 fee would cover his charges for the duration of his trip.

He said: 'I was sold this £6 deal under the impression that I
wouldn't be charged extortionate prices for using my phone abroad.

'I specifically phoned Orange and told
them that I wanted to use the internet abroad and they told me that 
this "bundle" deal, as they call it, would be my best bet.

'When I saw the bill for more than four grand, I was gobsmacked. I am so angry.'

Mr Baynes, a coordinator at a private care company, set out to the U.S. on September 24 with his friend Martin Sheridon, 31.

They spent four nights in San 
Francisco, four nights in LA and six nights in Las Vegas, using the 
internet regularly but making only one mobile phone call to the UK.

After listening to the recording of his call to the company, Orange has now admitted that he has been falsely sold the deal.

The telecoms giant originally offered Mr Baynes £100 towards the bill as a goodwill gesture while insisting he must
pay the remainder of the charges and settle his account.

Mr Baynes refused the £100 off offer and Orange increased the reduction in the bill by £1400.

After he refused to pay the reduced bill of £2,980.83 Orange finally conceded that he must pay £500, which he reluctantly accepted.

He said: 'I feel forced to accept their offer because I have no other choice really. It is absolutely ridiculous.

'The fact that Orange offered me £100 to begin with, and expected me to be grateful, is beyond a joke.

'I shouldn't have to pay out that kind of money when I was led to believe that purchasing a £6 internet bundle deal would cover me against these ridiculous charges.'

A spokesman for Orange said: 'We advise customers to call customer services before travelling abroad to find out about the charges and services available.

'In the case of Mr Baynes, we discussed the customer's expected data usage in advance of his travel and provided bundle advice.

'Orange is committed to giving customers transparency when it comes to our roaming rates to ensure they are aware of the different charges when they go abroad.

'We have a number of initiatives in place to help customers control their costs and we hope that these, as well as the customer's own individual responsibility, will ensure customers can manage their roaming costs appropriately.

'We look at all customer complaints on a case-by-case basis and can confirm we have offered Mr Bayne a resolution which he is happy with.'
