Council workers accidentally scrubbed a work of modern art off a gallery window - because they thought it was graffiti.

Contemporary artist Carrie Reichardt painted a black anarchy symbol on the outside of the Ink-d Gallery in Brighton, East Sussex, where an exhibition of her work is being held.

But Brighton and Hove City Council workers, mistaking the artwork for graffiti, washed the work off overnight, infuriating Ms Reichardt.

Ms Reichardt returned to Ink_d gallery in Brighton, where her work is on display, to repaint the sign in red, five times as big

The furious painter said Brighton was a liberal place but the actions of the council was 'more something you would expect in Nazi Germany'

The artist, who describes herself as a 'renegade potter and craftivist', has since re-painted the anarchy sign on the window of Ink_d gallery in Brighton - this time in red and five-times bigger.

She said: 'I was really shocked. I did not think it was legal for councils to remove things on private property.

'Brighton tends to present itself as this liberal place, but this is quite fascist.

'When you go around removing a symbol because you don't like it - that is more something you would expect in Nazi Germany.'

Curator and director of the gallery Dan Vaughan trawled through CCTV to work out how the work, which was painted on the window two weeks earlier, had disappeared.

Mr Vaughan said he is considering taking legal action against the local authority.

'This is a well-established contemporary artist and they have damaged a piece of art,' he said.

'I am now looking at options about how to take this forward.

Brighton and Hove City Council have apologised for removing the artwork and are investigating further 

'This happened to us back in 2007 but we were assured by the cleaners it would never happen again - I just can't believe it.

'I want the council to tell me what I can and can't put on my window. I don't know what they deem offensive but I need to know so this doesn't happen again.

'This is an art gallery, a place where you are supposed to be able to express things.'

In 2007, the council scrubbed off work by artist James Cauty, who had scrawled 'Portslade Massif' across the window and wall of Ink_d to advertise his exhibition. 

A spokeswoman for Brighton and Hove City Council said the graffiti team was not aware it was a piece of art and removed it by mistake.

She said it would 'investigate further to try to avoid similar instances in the future'.

She added: 'We apologise to the artist.'
