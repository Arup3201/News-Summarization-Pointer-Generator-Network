A Canadian mom-to-be suffering from a rare form of eye cancer opted to have one of her eyes removed rather than run the risk of the disease affecting her unborn child.

Chantal Gauthier-Vaillancourt, a popular midwife in Edmonton who has helped deliver hundreds of babies, underwent surgery on Wednesday to remove her right eye after learning that there was a chance the cancer could spread to the placenta.

The operation was successful and both Gauthier-Vaillancourt and the baby are recovering well, friends told local media outlets.

Tough decision: Chantal Gauthier-Vaillancourt decided to remove her cancerous eye rather than risk the disease spreading to her baby

Gauthier-Vaillancourt was first diagnosed with the rare disease in 2009.

'It was a malignant melanoma in my right eye that could spread to the liver and the bones,' she tells Global News.

She first tried natural therapy and then underwent radiation. By the end, doctors told her that she was in remission, but that she and her husband should wait to get pregnant, which they did.

Five years after finding out she was in remission, Gauthier-Vaillancourt found out she was pregnant.

'We were really excited about that,' she says. 'About two weeks later I 
went for my regular checkup and it was then that we discovered that the 
tumour had grown substantially in a very short period of time.'

Options: The couple's options were limited to abortion or risky surgery, neither of which seemed appropriate for them

Doctors told Gauthier-Vaillancourt that there was about a 25 percent chance that her cancer could spread to her placenta. But the options she and her husband had to consider were not good.

“Abortion, radiation, surgery [to remove the tumour]: none of those 
seemed appropriate for us,” says Gauthier-Vaillancourt, who knew if the 
surgery caused premature birth her child would not survive.

A fundraiser website has been setup to cover the costs of some of the natural therapies she has undergone, which aren't covered under her provincial health insurance plan. So far, the fundraiser has raised more than $20,000.

Success: Friends say the surgery to remove Gauthier-Vaillancourt's eye was successful and that she and the baby are recovering well

Gauthier-Vaillancourt says she is appreciative of all the support from her friends and family.

“It’s been a rough tide, but at the same time, I mean, everyone has 
problems and I honestly feel it’s just another bump in the road,” she 
says. “I keep saying, ‘This baby chose me, chose this situation and is 
very strong.’”
