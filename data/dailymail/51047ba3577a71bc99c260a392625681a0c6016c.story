Have you ever had that sinking feeling?

Well Max Miller, a student from Northeastern University in Illinois, certainly came close to the murky depths as he experienced a titanic kayaking disaster.

The amateur oarsman was filmed in a state of wild panic as his watercraft slowly started dipping below the surface of a weed-ridden river.

'Sarah help me, my kayak's sinking,' he wails to his friend, while pulling an array of tearful facial expressions at the camera.

Sinking feeling: Max Miller, a student from Northeastern University in Illinois, experienced a kayaking disaster

Help! The amateur oarsman was filmed in a state of wild panic as his watercraft slowly started dipping below the surface of a weed-ridden river

Caught on camera: 'Sarah help me, my kayak's sinking,' he wails to his friend, while pulling an array of tearful facial expressions

However, Sarah appears to see the funnier side of things as she watches from a distance recording the debacle.

At one point she urges Max to stand up on the river bed, while holding back giggles.

But poor Max seems unenthused about the idea.

'No it's too deep,' he sobs. He gets even more agitated as weed sticks to his paddle and gets on his shirt.

At that point, he hits his limit and tosses his paddle into the river.

'Oh my God, I don't know what to do,' Max pines.

'What do you want me to do? I don't know how to help you. You need to go to land and flip your kayak over,' Sarah responds.

The footage then cuts to show Max submerged in the water wearing a life jacket with his kayak tipped upside down. 

He continues to dramatically flounder around, with his boat failing to correct itself.

Sarah reassured YouTube viewers that Max escaped the disaster unscathed.

To date more than 1.5million have watched him in action. Many have sympathized with his pain, however one commenter sarcastically remarked: 'Future Navy Seal in training.'

Max was attempting to kayak on a river in Boulder Junction, Wisconsin, when he ran into trouble last summer. This year, maybe it will be better to stick to dry land.
