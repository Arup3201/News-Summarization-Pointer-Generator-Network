Hell of a heel: British women now wear the highest heels in Europe

'If you can't beat them, join them', goes the saying. And British women are certainly living by that mantra when it comes to their height.

We may be some of the shortest ladies in Europe, but we're compensating by wearing the highest heels on the continent, according to a new study.

Following in the footsteps (literally) of stiletto-mad celebrities such as Victoria Beckham and Cheryl Cole, British women are now tottering around on an average heel height of 3.3 inches.

That's almost one whole inch more than the petite women of France who, favouring a heel of 2.4 inches, wear only the fifth highest shoe in Europe.

Hot on the heels of the
Brits, preferring an average height of 3.2 inches, are the women of Spain, while Danes wear
3 inches and the Germans 2.7 inches.

The study comes as British women are revealed to now be among the shortest in Europe, with the average 18- to 29-year-old measuring in at 5ft 4ins (163cm).

Our German counterparts are tower over us by five centimetres, at 5ft 6ins, while the Spanish are just one centimetre taller than us.

Perhaps in a bid to tower over continental counterparts, a quarter of British women brave stilettos of between four and six inches high.

And even though Victoria Beckham has 
admitted to suffering from bunions because of her dedication to the 
high-heeled cause, three per cent of UK ladies still admit to preferring
heels loftier than than six inches.

The average British woman is also suffering according to the survey, with 65 per cent saying they have experienced significant pain because of their shoes.

It seems we are prepared go through it because, according to psychologists, appearing taller makes us seem more confident, successful 
and even intelligent.

Psychologist, Emma Kenny said: 'A
tall woman is considered more assertive, confident, richer, capable, 
successful, independent and even more intelligent than those who are 
shorter.

'Perception is 
incredibly powerful and it makes sense that the feedback we receive from
the way we are treated by others will reinforce our choices.

'British
women are ambitious and if putting on a pair of six inch heels 
increases their career prospects the savvy individual will do so.'

Within Britain, the height of heel women prefer to walk in is dependent on location.

Women in the north-east were found to be wearing the highest heels in the UK - an eye-watering 3.46 inches.

They were followed by Londoners in 3.37 
inches, the West Midlands at 3.35 inches, Scotland at 3.28 inches and 
the women of east England in heels of 3.25 inches.

As many as 65 per cent of British 
women say they have suffered a significant amount of pain as a result of
their choice of footwear, but a staggering half of these were prepared to endure the agony, which is compared to toothache and earache.

Size matters: We may be among the shortest women in Europe but we are trying our best to walk tall by wearing heels of, on average, 3.3 inches

Rachel Long, from London, said she was prepared to suffer in order to look good. The
35-year-old office clerk added: 'Heels make me feel more confident and 
attractive, and I feel the higher they are, the better.

'It does mean my feet are suffering a bit but I’m prepared to go through it.”

The study of 3,792 women, conducted by foot care brand Compeed, also found the shorter the person, the higher the heel.

Step up: British women wear the highest heels in Europe, followed by Spanish, Danish, German and French girls

Lorraine Jones, from the Society
of Chiropodists and Podiatrists added: 'I recognise that with fashion 
as it is, wearing foot-friendly shoes is not always easy. However, wearing fashionable shoes occasionally is fine.

'There
are plenty of easy foot care treatments available that can help treat 
feet at home and avoid a trip to the podiatrist’s clinic.

'With healthy feet, a woman can stand as tall as she wants in the highest of heels.'
