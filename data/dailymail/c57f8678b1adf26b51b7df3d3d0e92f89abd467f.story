Saracens suffered a fate that has become familiar to so many top European teams over the years at Thomond Park, as they were pounded into submission by Munster, after a costly yellow card for Rhys Gill.

The Aviva Premiership side came here with considerable belief and they were in the hunt for much of an abrasive Pool One tie. Mark McCall’s visitors had shown plenty of their warrior spirit and the fiery competitive streak of their ‘Wolf-pack’ defence, but the tipping point – quite literally – came in the 52nd minute as Welsh prop Gill was sin-binned for wildly up-ending CJ Stander at a ruck.

Before that telling incident, the force increasingly had been with Saracens in a tight tussle, which was locked at 3-3. But by the time Gill returned to the field, the challenge of the English team had been fatally undermined, as they trailed by eight points and had emphatically conceded the initiative. From then on, the outcome was inevitable.

‘The yellow card was a real momentum-swinger,’ said McCall, Saracens’ director of rugby. ‘The decision (by the referee) was fair enough – you can’t tip people above the horizontal in the air. It was an accident, but Munster took advantage of it, as they do. Once they were ahead, it wasn’t a night for playing catch-up rugby.’

This was an important night for England fly-half Owen Farrell, who was making just his second start of the season, having missed three matches with a quad injury. 

He landed one of his two goal kicks, committed himself with gusto in defence and for a spell began to find some passing rhythm. He was also evidently trying to play close to the Munster defensive line, whenever the opportunity arose.

But this was not a game which allowed him to click through the gears and he occasionally appeared to be moving with a lack of freedom – with the recently-damaged leg still strapped. Yet, McCall was satisfied with his playmaker, saying: ‘I thought he did well.

‘It was hard to be our No 10 tonight because we didn’t have a lot of ball, but when we did we looked dangerous. Owen played the full 80 minutes, which was important for him.’

It was Farrell’s first full 80-minute outing this season and England will be relieved that he has had that precious game-time, providing he doesn’t suffer any repercussions in the aftermath.

While that was good news for national coach Stuart Lancaster, he will also have been heartened to see how some of his squad members performed in a match which reached Test intensity at times. 

This was a full-throttle game in a hostile atmosphere and that experience will benefit new England lock George Kruis, who appeared to cope well with the occasion.

Billy Vunipola was especially prominent for Saracens, but he withdrew in the closing stages after a bang to the head. The No 8 didn’t appear to be in a bad way, but the national management will be keen to assess him on Sunday, in the hope that he is fully fit to join the start of the pre-QBE series preparations in Surrey.

Friday night’s defeat was a setback for Saracens but by no means a devastating blow to their hopes of qualifying for the knock-out stages. They were attempting to turn the tide of history in Europe’s final frontier – where the hopes of visiting teams come to die.

Munster may have fallen behind Irish rivals Leinster in the recent roll-call of continental triumph, but they remain the most unwelcoming of hosts. In 19 seasons of the old Heineken Cup they lost just twice in their renowned fortress; against Leicester in 2009 and Ulster three years later. Once again, they showed why they are so effective at home – harnessing the fervent support from the stands to storm the barricades with a pack onslaught and an astute kicking game led by Conor Murray.

Yet, for all their command of territory and possession, Munster couldn’t assume control on the scoreboard as Ian Keatley had a mixed night in front of goal. It was 3-3 at the break and that was still the scoreline when Gill’s rash intervention turned the match Munster’s way.

They soon had another penalty to their name and despite a seemingly legitimate try by Andrew Conway being ruled out, Dave Kilcoyne was driven over seconds later. Keatley capitalised on another powerful assault to knock over a drop goal and the game was up. Saracens had fought the good fight – with Scotland lock Jim Hamilton the epitome of ferocious defiance – but they couldn’t build on last week’s win over Clermont Auvergne by claiming another prized scalp.

McCall was disappointed by the result but said: ‘I’m proud of the effort from the players. We wanted to come away from this game with something and we weren’t overwhelmed by the occasion but we made too many errors – that was the story of our night. But we have five points from our first two games and this pool is wide open.’
