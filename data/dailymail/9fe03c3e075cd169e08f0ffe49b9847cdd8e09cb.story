Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings has revealed that a dog belonging to Ebola patient Nina Pham is not expected to be put down.

Miss Pham, 26, from Fort Worth, Texas was one of the team of medical staff who treated Thomas Duncan at the Dallas hospital before he died from the dreaded virus last week. 

Speaking to USA Today, Rawlings said 'This was a new twist. The dog's very important to the patient and we want it to be safe.'

The dog is going to be transported out of the apartment, Rawlings told the newspaper.

Miss Pham, who works at Texas Health Presbyterian hospital, caught the virus from Thomas Duncan - the first Ebola sufferer to have been diagnosed in the U.S.

Rawlings expressed similar concerns about the dog to The Wall Street Journal, saying:'This dog is an important part of the family to our health care worker. We want to make sure the dog is in a safe place.' 

'We'll assist with [getting the dog out],' CG Environmental employee Brad Smith told USA Today. 'We have the [personal protection equipment] that needs to be worn.'

There was a brief but intense battle last week between health officials and protesters over the life of Excalibur, a light brown mixed breed dog belonging to a Spanish nursing assistant, Teresa Romero, and her husband. 

Romero was diagnosed with the deadly virus Monday, contracted when she treated a victim who came from Sierra Leone.

Fight for survival: Excalibur, the dog of the Spanish Ebola patient, is seen in this photograph from last week. The dog was euthanized, despite uncertainty over whether the dog was also infected or risked spreading the disease

Officials from Madrid's regional government got a court order Tuesday to euthanize the pet, despite uncertainty over whether the dog was also infected or risked spreading the disease to humans.

By that afternoon, 30 to 40 animal rights activists had taken up positions outside Romero's apartment complex, determined to prevent officials from entering.

Then Romero's quarantined husband, Javier, recruited a veterinarian who hosts a popular radio talk show in a bid to spare his dog's life.

'I'm in the hospital and I'm making a call to all people to help me save my dog Excalibur because they want to kill him just like that, without following any procedure,' Mr Romero said in a video appeal from his hospital room. Within hours, the cause went viral.

On Twitter, the hashtag (hash)SalvemosaExcalibur - 'Let's Save Excalibur' - was tweeted nearly 400,000 times in 24 hours, making it the social networking site's second most popular meme worldwide.

In an equally short time, a petition set up on the Change.org website demanding the dog's life be saved garnered more than 380,000 signatures, and a second petition gathered 70,000 more. 

But after refusing the say when the dog would be taken away, the Madrid regional government announced Wednesday evening that it had euthanized the pet.

Excalibur was 'sedated beforehand to avoid suffering,' Madrid's regional health agency said in a statement.

The corpse was then 'put into a sealed biosecurity device and transferred for incineration at an authorized disposal facility,' the statement said.

The health agency said that the dog was killed because it posed a risk of transmitting the disease to humans.

There is no documented case of Ebola spreading to people from dogs. But at least one major study suggests dogs can get the disease without showing symptoms. Experts say they are uncertain of what risk that poses to humans. Spanish authorities, though, were taking no chances.

When the white veterinary van carrying Excalibur's body left the apartment complex Wednesday, black plastic covered the outside of the windows. 

Dozens of protesters stood in front of it and forced it to stop, briefly. Then baton-wielding police officers beat back the crowd and the van drove away.
