Bus lane cameras have raked in £1m in less than three months after they were installed to catch out motorists.

As part of the bus lane crackdown, CCTV cameras were installed at 11 locations on busy main roads leading into Glasgow city centre.

More than 39,000 penalties have been issued – equivalent to more than 500 a day.

Hefty fine: With CCTV cameras in 11 locations it's no wonder they've drawn in £1 million in just 11 weeks from spots like this where drivers drive through the bus gate at Hope Street and Waterloo Street Junction

The law-breaking drivers must pay a £60 fine which is cut to £30 if paid within two weeks.

A similar scheme in Edinburgh was suspended just weeks after its launch when the council was bombarded with complaints from angry motorists.

Jim Coleman, Glasgow City Council’s transport spokesman, said: ‘The minority of drivers who abuse bus lanes inconvenience others and their behaviour can lead to danger to pedestrians, cyclists and other road users and also reduces the effectiveness of the city’s public transport service.

The plans: The cameras in bus lanes are to encourage commuters to use public transport

‘Having measures in place to ensure bus services can run in dedicated lanes without being snared up in traffic is one of many ways to make drivers aware of the benefits of switching to public transport.’

Stephen Flynn, vice chairman of Glasgow Taxis, said: ‘These dedicated bus and taxi lanes can help to ease public transport flow in, out and through Glasgow, in particular in and around the city centre.

‘What this crackdown has highlighted is the sheer number of people who were flouting the rules and contributing to unnecessary congestion.

‘It is a staggering number and it seems very unfair that the majority of drivers should obey the rules while a minority continues to ignore them.’
