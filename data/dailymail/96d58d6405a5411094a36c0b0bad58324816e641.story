Hatem Ben Arfa has claimed that he would have turned down Real Madrid such was his desire for a move to Nice.

The French winger’s contract at Newcastle United was terminated by mutual consent last weekend after his attitude and fitness came under question as he fell out of favour with former manager Alan Pardew on Tyneside. 

The same issues appeared to emerge during his previous loan at Hull City.

Ben Arfa will wear the number four jersey with his new side and he said: ‘Within 10 minutes, my choice was made. Even if Real had come calling, I’d have said yes to Nice.’

Ben Arfa, 27, showed flashes of his considerable talent during a four year spell in England and he scored several spectacular goals in a Newcastle shirt. 

On suggestions that he possesses a special talent, Ben Arfa said: ‘Me, a genius? This comes from the journalists. I am only a player who tries to work hard and enjoy myself.

‘Nice is a club with a great identity. It is a pleasure to return to France to Ligue 1. Nice will be the perfect environoment for me to blossom. 

'This club is building towards something. Their management is ambitious. It is very good for me.’

He told L'Equipe: 'I also spoke to the coach (Claude Puel), I liked his integrity and his approach to football and within 10 minutes, my choice was made. Even if Real Madrid had called at that moment, my mind was made up!

'There are people here who trust me, who do not judge me as some people want to judge me through the press.

'I wanted to return to France, where I grew up. At Nice, I think I can express myself. I am coming here to enjoy myself, to help the club improve with my qualities, and to win.'  

Ben Arfa scored 14 goals in 86 appearances for Newcastle but was surplus to requirements at St James' Park
