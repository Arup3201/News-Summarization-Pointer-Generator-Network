Boris Johnson has claimed Britain is ‘on the verge of an utter catastrophe’ as Scotland swings closer to voting for separation.

The London Mayor attacked the ‘complacency’  in the rest of the country over the prospect of Scottish independence.

He said the country was ‘sleepwalking’ into a tragedy amid growing evidence of a surge in support for the ‘Yes’ to independence campaign.

A poll released yesterday showed support for independence was now in the lead by two points – by 51 per cent to 49 per cent.

Writing in the Telegraph, Mr Johnson warned that it was time to speak out to save Britain.

He said: ‘In just 10 days’ time we could all be walking around like zombies – on both sides of the Scottish border.’

The London mayor said the Scots had ‘yet to think through the horrific financial and constitutional implications of an English-Scottish divorce’.

He added: ‘We are on the verge of trashing our global name and brand in an act of self-mutilation that will leave our international rivals stunned, gleeful and discreetly scornful.’

Mr Johnson said it would be worse than losing American in 1776.

He said: ‘The entity under mortal threat next week is Britain itself. You cannot refer to a state called “Britain” unless you include Scotland, because it is a basic fact of geography that Britain comprises everything from Land’s End to John o’Groats.’

‘Take away Scotland, and we destroy Britain.’

Mr Johnson added: ‘Britain, British, Britishness: these are precious terms, and they stand for something wonderful across the world.’

He said he was ‘appalled’ by the complacency people were showing.

Mr Johnson said: ‘I am praying that we will wake from this sleepwalk to tragedy; and that the Scots vote no to divorce, and yes to Britain, the greatest political union ever.’
