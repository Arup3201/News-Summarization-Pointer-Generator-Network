Sunday marks Louis van Gaal's first real test since he took over as the manager of Manchester United. In the absence of Champions League football, he has avoided meeting any of the leading European clubs. And incredibly, given United's poor start to the season, they have not played any of last season's top four in the Premier League yet.

Of course, that's all about to change with Sunday's game against Chelsea, the derby at Manchester City next month and a visit to Arsenal in four weeks. By then we'll know if the small signs of improvement recently at United are genuine.

Although they are looking better offensively than last season, it is not the United of old yet. You used to fear that red tide of players coming at you at Old Trafford and I haven't seen that under Van Gaal.

Plenty has been said about Cesc Fabregas's passing but there's a part of his game that has been overlooked and which is just as important to Chelsea. That's the runs he makes for his team-mates on the overlap to get beyond the player in possession and provide an option in a position which hurts the opposition.

He'll go round the outside of his team-mate, bursting a gut to do it, and create a chance just by the timing of his run. Some players can do that 12 times in a game and never affect it. But he can smell the opportunities in the final third, when it's right to go and better to stay. 

He reads the situation so well, his timing is perfect and he knows when it's going to hurt. On at least five occasions this season I've seen him do it to create a goal. Fabregas might have signed for United last year. Today may be the day they regret missing out on him.

He has the players to do it. Even with Wayne Rooney suspended, there's Robin van Persie, Radamel Falcao, Juan Mata, Angel di Maria and Adnan Januzaj with Marouane Fellaini coming into contention after his goal and performance in the second half at West Brom.

But so far they haven't been as aggressive or ruthless as Sir Alex Ferguson's teams. That's what I'm waiting to see from them today. Given United don't really have the players to be cautious, it would not surprise me if Van Gaal goes with a diamond formation, with two up front, so he can get Van Persie, Falcao, Di Maria and Mata into the team. With Diego Costa very doubtful and Loic Remy injured, Chelsea may have to start with Didier Drogba or Andre Schurrle up front, and if they do, this is United's opportunity to take the game to Chelsea.

Sunday will give us a good idea just how good this United team can be, because Chelsea have a back four and a midfield that can soak up pressure, deal with crosses and cope with neat football being played in front of them. When you look at Jose Mourinho's record away from home in big games, he often likes to counter attack. If Costa and Remy are out, that will make him more inclined to play that way. And with a five-point lead, he can afford to play it cagey and look to break on United.

United's Achilles heel is obviously their defence. Should Drogba play, even at the age of 36, you could imagine him bullying their centre-halves, especially Phil Jones. But Jones can't allow that to happen. At 22 years of age, he's no longer an inexperienced player and he must dominate a centre-forward, even someone like Drogba.

If Van Gaal chooses the diamond formation, United will have to be extremely co-ordinated behind the front two to defend, especially given the width Chelsea could have in Eden Hazard, Schurrle — if he's playing wide — or Willian. At the moment with United, you feel 75 per cent of their game is focused on how to play well going forward. With the defence it feels as though it's a case of: 'We'll play a back four and hope they can cope with it.'

In between games, Van Gaal will obviously be working hard to remedy that and drilling their defensive shape. But Mourinho's teams are the masters at exploiting space on the break and with Oscar, Hazard and Cesc Fabregas they have the ideal players to do that.

Daley Blind has a key job to do in shielding the defence. He's a lovely distributor of the ball, he keeps his passing very simple but he has a screening job to do, too. But Di Maria, Ander Herrera and Mata have their part to play as well.

The whole team will have to work as a unit and for Mata, playing against the manager who sold him a year ago, it's an opportunity to prove a point.

You would imagine that part of the reason why Mourinho was willing to sell him was his weakness in contributing to defensive duties, so the Spaniard will not lack motivation. There is a lot more to come from him. He's a talented player but so far he hasn't found the consistency he had at Chelsea in his first two seasons. There are great performances in him but they have been few and far between at United.

I'm intrigued as to how it plays out. Given the make-up of the teams I'm expecting goals rather than a tight game. When the two biggest personalities managing in the Premier League collide, you would be right to expect something special.
