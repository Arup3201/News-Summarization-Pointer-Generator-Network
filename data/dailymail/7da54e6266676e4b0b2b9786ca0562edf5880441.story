Airline cabin cleaners at two of America's busiest airports walked out in protest over fears they could be exposed to Ebola. 

Around 200 workers responsible for keeping the inside of the planes at LaGuardia and JFK International in New York clean held a demonstration outside the terminals overnight on Wednesday, complaining that they often have to encounter hypodermic needles, vomit and blood.

The employees who work for Air Serv, a company contracted by Delta, held up placards and chanted 'no justice, no peace' on Wednesday night and Thursday morning, suggesting they were ill-equipped to deal with sick passengers

As the international Ebola crisis continues, a British man is said to have died from the deadly infection in Macedonia.

A doctor has also rubbished the panic-buying of 'Ebola protection kits' as a waste of money, suggesting the only use the general public will have for them is as a Halloween costume. 

Dr Tom Frieden, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevntion, has also warned the spread of the vrisu could become a global health catastrophe that could rivals aids.

As the workers walked out at LaGuardia and JFK The Service Employees International Union Local 32BJ was scheduled to conduct infectious disease training today for airport cabin cleaners, terminal cleaners and wheelchair attendants.

It was aimed at helping workers to identify infectious disease hazards and protect against exposure and spread.

But the workers, who don't deal with international flights, said their concerns predate the Ebola scare, and the newest threat has pushed them to demonstrate. 

Joel Castillo, 23 from Far Rockaway, New York who usually works in the afternoon, told the Wall Street Journal he would not work Thursday, adding: 'We're protesting because we don't have adequate protection.'

Complaints: A woman holds up a sign alleging the company of treating their employees like garbage

He said sometimes airplane equipment can malfunction, exposing staffers to human waste, and said workers were requesting body suits and durable gloves. 

Mr Castillo added that the current gloves provided are 'like paper; they rip easily.'

'If it wasn’t for Ebola, we’d still be striking. But we have heightened concerns because of it,'

Five major US airports have added an extra layer of security in a bid to prevent anyone with the disease from entering the country.

The screening will include taking the temperature of passengers who have flown from disease-ravaged countries.  

The new airport screening will begin Saturday at New York's JFK International Airport and then expand to Washington Dulles and the international airports in Atlanta, Chicago and Newark, New Jersey. The White House said checks would reach more than 9 of 10 travelers to the U.S. from the outbreak zone.

Instruction: Mary Moorer trains workers from the union 32BJ, many of them airline cabin cleaners, terminal cleaners and wheelchair attendants, on how to better protect themselves from infectious diseases 

Safety: The infectious disease training classes will show the workers how to put on protective clothing and handle potentially harmful bodily fluids 

Protection: A cleaner holds up their hands wearing rubber gloves during the training at LaGuardia airport 

President Obama is calling it a 'belt and suspenders' approach.

Thomas Eric Duncan, the first person to be diagnosed with Ebola on US soil, was able to get into the country after he allegedly lied on a health form in Libera. He died on Wednesday after contracting the deadly infection.

Today his family said they believe he wasn't given the same quality of care leading up to his death Wednesday morning as the other patients treated in the U.S. for the dreaded virus. 

His newphew Joe Weeks and others in his family are calling his treatment 'unfair,' after seeing other patients pulled from the brink of death in government-funded evacuation planes and using life-saving blood transfusions and cutting edge drugs. 

 Five US citizens have been diagnosed with Ebola and three of them have beaten it. NBC News cameraman Ashoka Mukpo, the latest American victim, arrived at the infectious disease ward at the University of Nebraska Medical Center this week for treatment. 

A fourth victim, a World Health Organization doctor, is being treated in Atlanta.

All five have been flown to specially designed infectious disease wards in Nebraska or Atlanta for treatment by some of the world's top doctors.
