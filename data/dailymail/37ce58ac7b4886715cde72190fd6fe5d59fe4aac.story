Stricken electrical retail chain Comet is axing 330 staff at its headquarters and support centres.

Administrator Deloittes  across made the announcement today but stressed there had been no redundancies of shop staff and that all Comet's 236 stores remain open.

The bulk of the staff cuts have been made in the company's head office in Rickmansworth, Hertfordshire as well as at its site in Hull and a call centre in Clevedon, Somerset.

Deloitte added that it was holding talks with a number of potential buyers for Comet, which fell into administration a week ago.

Economic woes: As shoppers searched for bargains today administrator Deloitte announced 330 job losses at Comet

The news came as bargain hunters 
descended on stores across the country in the hope of picking up a 
discount product ahead of planned closures next week.

However, although the electrical 
retailer's website announced a 'massive stock liquidation' in its 236 
stores, many dismayed shoppers were greeted with price cuts of just 10 
per cent.

Many of those who dashed to visited the sale today described it as 'nothing special' and a 'waste of time'.

Another added: 'Even with a massive liquidation sale, they're still a massive rip off!'  

Comet is being run by administrators Deloitte, who are moving to wind down the failed retailer ahead of closures.

Customers are only able to get the reduced prices in shops, with the website providing just a question
and answer page, store locations.

It also confirms that gift cards will 
be accepted during the sale, after they initially announcing that all vouchers had been suspended.

There were a few bargains to be had in some places, however, with one Twitter user reporting that he had bought a 14 megapixel camera for £50.

But @RyanEsq echoed many shoppers' sentiments when he tweeted: 'Comet liquidation sale, rather underwhelming! 10% here odd 20% there. Very poor! Can see why they got into trouble!'

Spree: Others were more successful and were seen leaving the store in Royton, Oldham with cut-price electrical goods

Opportunity: Customers picked up TVs and kitchen appliances at the liquidation sale

No refunds: Families in North Tyneside buy what they can before Comet shuts up shop

Big promise: Comet's website is directing shoppers to stores for the sale, but any ordered items that are not in stock may never arrive

Price reductions were 'meagre' today, warned inquirer.net, and the most attractive items were only discounted by 10 per cent.

It added: 'In the 15 per cent discount bin we found mice, 20 per cent included fat fryers, printer ink and DVD players, and the 30 per cent lot included TV stands.'

Martin Lewis, the creator of MoneySavingExpert.com, said: 'The Comet sale is not earth shattering – certainly there are no once in a lifetime deals.

'Where it does scrape a few quid off are for branded goods that are rarely discounted such as iPads and Kindles. If you're looking for TVs or washing machines, you'll still find cheaper using comparison sites.

'It's also worth asking the question: what will happen if goods go wrong?

'Normally your rights are with the retailer, but if Comet ceases to exist soon, you'll be reliant on the manufacturers' warranty rather than your statutory consumer rights.'

Mixed results: Discounts varied from store to store. Left, Bristol and right, Derby

'Hold off': One shopper advised others not to bother with Comet because price reductions were still relatively small

Comet's website is also warning customers 
that it is no longer providing refunds, and any goods ordered but not 
paid for prior to administration will not be delivered.

The
sale follows suggestions that staff at the collapsed chain could have 
the chance to join Dixons, after the chain outlined plans to take on 
seasonal staff.

The owner of 
PC World and Currys has delayed its normal Christmas recruitment drive, 
when it expects to take on an additional 2,000 seasonal shop staff, to 
offer Comet staff the opportunity to join the business.

Comet
was placed into administration on Friday and Deloitte
has been searching for a buyer for its shops since last week.

The
high street electricals market in the UK has come under huge pressure 
as cash-strapped shoppers put off purchases of expensive 
TVs and large appliances.

It is also facing stiff competition from the low prices of online retailers such as Amazon, which have fewer overheads - as many customers are aware.

Many customers dashed to their local Comet store today in the hope of 'massive' discounts only to be left sorely disappointed

As MoneySavingExpert.com found out, some items were still cheaper in rival stores even after the price cuts.
