The far right political party Britain First has told its supporters to vote Ukip and help deliver 'major gains' at the general election.

In his party's newsletter, group leader Paul Golding said he would 'strongly urge our supporters to vote for UKIP as they have the best chance of making breakthroughs at the ballot box.'

The endorsement from the extreme right group will come as an embarrassing blow to Nigel Farage who has been attempting to distance himself from the far right.

Britain First leader Paul Golding has urged his supporters to back Ukip in the election and predicts that 2015 will be 'the year of Britain First and Ukip'

Mr Golding said that he believed the election could trigger a swing to the right in British politics.

'Whatever happens in May, between UKIP and Britain First, this year could herald a resurgence of patriotic politics in Britain,' he added.   

But a Ukip spokesman told the Independent it was farcical that Britain First was supporting them. 'We're just not where they think we are,' he said. 'On the fringes of our politics are nutters and we don't want them anywhere near us.'

Britain First has become renowned for its invasions on mosques and campaign against the alleged 'Islamification' of Britain. 

But Nigel Farage has previously attempted to distance himself from Britain First and other far rights parties across Europe

The party has told its supporters to ignore Ukip's attempts to distance themselves and said the party must play the 'political game.'

In literature seen by the Independent, the party said its controversial activities 'in the Muslim ghettoes' will combine with 'major Ukip gains' to turn the election into a 'game changer'.

Leaflets signed by Mr Golding predicted that 2015 would be 'the year of Britain First and Ukip' after the election.

The election tactics echo those used for the Rochester by-election last year, when the party distributed leaflets which proclaimed: 'Ukip at the ballot box, Britain First on the streets – a winning combination.'

The election went onto be won by former Conservative MP Mark Reckless, who defected to Ukip.

Britain First was founded by former British National Party member Jim Dowson in 2011.

It hit the headlines after invading mosques in Glasgow, Bradford, Luton and London with Bibles offered to Muslim worshippers.

They were also seen driving military armoured cars up and down Brick Lane to no apparent purpose.

Britain First's tactics , pictured here disrupting a Unite Against Fascism (UAF) anti-racism protest, have come under criticism in the past

Last year the group conducted 'Christian patrols' in parts of East London which the group claimed  were a direct response to similar Muslim groups who, they said, wanted Sharia Law enforced in some boroughs. 

Britain First activists were seen outside mosques holding banners announcing: 'We are the British resistance.'

The party, which received 20,000 votes in last year's European elections, wants 'assisted repatriation', a halt to further immigration, and the deportation of all asylum seekers. It also wants all foreign criminals to be deported without recourse to the law courts.
