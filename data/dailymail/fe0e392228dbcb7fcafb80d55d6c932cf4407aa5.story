In a hurry: Timothy Thompson was allegedly driving erratically and nearly totalled his car

A would-be groom has reportedly spent his wedding night in jail after police allegedly caught him driving at 100 mph to get to the church on time.

Timothy N. Thompson, 23, of Valparaiso, Indiana was heading to his 7pm ceremony at the Nativity of Our Savior Church on Saturday when an officer spotted him speeding around 6.30pm.

Thompson, who the officer predicted was travelling at 100mph, was driving erratically, abruptly switching lanes and almost totalling his Jeep Grand Cherokee, the police report noted.

Officers followed in close pursuit as he turned into the church's parking lot and watched as he nearly tipped over the vehicle, the Northwest Indiana Times reported.

Three relatives were waving their arms and shouting at Thompson as he drove into the parking lot, before he accelerated and performed a 'doughnut', making a thick blanket of smoke, police said.

When he finally stopped the car, Thompson told police that he was late for his wedding.

He also said he had just been released from jail earlier that day.

He claimed he was driving 'about 90 mph' and said he had his emergency lights on and was sounding his horn so drivers knew to get out of the way, the Times reported.

When an officer walked away from his vehicle, he climbed back inside and drove towards the church.

'Groom': Thompson was arrested for charges including criminal recklessness and reckless driving

As police stopped him again, he reportedly said: 'Oh, I thought you were done and I'm 
late for a party in Chicago. It now 
means I have to drive really fast to get there.'

Instead of heading inside to wait for his bride, Thompson was arrested for resisting law enforcement, criminal recklessness and reckless driving. He was also cited for speeding and improper passing.

He did not make his wedding and was instead taken to Porter County Jail, where he was held without bond.
