Louis van Gaal claims he 'taught Sergio Romero how to save penalties' when he managed the Argentina goalkeeper at AZ Alkmaar - and now the stopper's shoot-out saves have seen Holland knocked out of the World Cup.

Romero was Argentinaâ€™s hero as La Albiceleste beat Holland on penalties in Sao Paulo to reach the World Cup final, keeping the Dutch at bay for 120 minutes before saving from Ron Vlaar and Wesley Sneijder.

Argentina will take on Germany in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday but here, Sportsmail reveals all you need to know about Romero.

So, who is this Sergio Romero?

Romero is Argentina's number one and has been the preferred choice of Alejandro Sabella during the coach's tenure.

He spent last season on loan at Monaco from his parent club Sampdoria, for who he signed in 2011.

The 27-year-old was far from first choice, however, and made just three league appearances last season for the principality club.

In fact, Holland coach Louis van Gaal will have known all about Romero before the World Cup semi-final as he coached the goalkeeper to the Eredevisie title in 2009 with AZ Alkmaar. Oh how he came back to haunt his former manager with two splendid saves in the shoot-out.

Has he come from nowhere?

Even though he may not have been first choice at Monaco last season he is an experienced goalkeeper.

He has 51 caps for the Argentine national side and made his debut in 2009. He has been first choice more or less ever since, including playing during the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.

Romero has also played the best part of 160 league games through his career so he is far from inexperienced.

Experienced: Romero has 51 Argentina caps and also played in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa

Reaching new heights: Romero has been Argentina's number one ever since his debut in 2009

Where else has he played?

Racing Club de Avellandea (Argentina, 2006-07)

AZ Alkmaar (Holland, 2007-09)

Sampdoria (Italy, 2009-present)

Monaco (France, loan, 2013-14)

Has he won anything?

Yes, he has both international and club honours.

As previously mentioned he won the 2008-09 Eredivisie title under Van Gaal's guidance and the Dutchman said he taught Romero how to save penalties during that time.

He also won a gold medal at the 2008 Olympics for Argentina in Beijing alongside Lionel Messi, as well as the FIFA Under-20 World Cup in 2007.
