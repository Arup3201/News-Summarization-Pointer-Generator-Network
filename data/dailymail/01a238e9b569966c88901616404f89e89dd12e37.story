Tragedy: Victoria Harrison died during a routine appendix operation at Kettering General Hospital, who had tried to hide its failings to protect its staff

A hospital where a young hairdresser bled to death over 15 hours has been forced to admit a catalogue of 43 errors just weeks after it tried to hide the full details to avoid 'putting staff under more stress'.

Victoria Harrison died after an artery was torn during appendix surgery at Kettering General Hospital in Northamptonshire.

In the hours before she died the 17-year-old was so scared for her safety she texted a picture of her blood-soaked T-shirt to her boyfriend.

At her inquest in December Northamptonshire Coroner Anne Pember criticised the 
hospital for their 'poor' levels of care and said she believed 
Victoria's life could have been saved.

Despite calls from her family to come clean over the full scale of its mistakes the hospital refused to say exactly what the errors were for fear of 'putting staff under more stress'

The hospital's chief executive, Fiona Wise, said in January: 'We have a right to withhold that information where we feel it is appropriate to prevent further damage to individuals who have already been through a thorough investigation process.'

But today a BBC Freedom of Information request forced them to reveal the 43 errors, how it dealt with unprofessional staff and its plans to improve care.

Mistakes included uncertainty about Victoria's level of blood loss, inconsistency in handovers between nursing teams, and staff did not properly monitor Miss Harrison.

Today's FOI response also revealed that ten staff were disciplined after her death.

Bereft: Victoria's mother Tracy Foskett and sister Sarah Francis have demanded answers about how their loved-one died

Damning:  A report by Kettering General Hospital NHS Foundation Trust found its staff made 43 errors while caring for Miss Harrison there before she died

The teenager had been admitted to hospital for routine key-hole surgery on August 15 last year after suffering abdominal pains.

But
 during the 30-minute operation to remove her appendix, she suffered 
internal bleeding when surgeons tore a hole in an artery while inserting
 a micro-camera into her stomach.

Staff
 managed to repair the hole but she lost almost half a pint of blood and
 she was sent to recover on a ward, but died the next day.

Life lost: Victoria was admitted to hospital for the simple operation on August 15 this year, but within 15 hours she had died

An
 inquest at the Best Western Hotel in Corby, Northamptonshire, heard 
nurses failed to read her medical notes which indicated she had suffered
 a large bleed during surgery.

She was not properly checked and nurses failed to take her blood pressure which would have indicated her blood loss.

Despite complaining of being in pain nurses gave her morphine until she suffered heart failure and died at 7am on August 16.

Tragically, Victoria - who was the youngest of three siblings - was due to see her big sister Sarah-Louise, 22, get married that weekend after picking out her wedding dress.

Gillian Joy, the recovery nurse looking after Victoria, told her in Corby inquest she had not been told the patient had bled during the surgery and did not read the operation notes.

Despite complaining of being in pain nurses gave her morphine until she suffered heart failure and died at 7am on August 16.

Speaking after the hearing, Victoria's mother Tracey Foskett, 42, paid tribute to her 'wonderful' daughter and said she hoped lessons had been learned to spare others similar heartache.

She said: 'I would like to thank all my family who have been there for me and my friends and Victoria's friends who have supported me throughout the devastating loss of my daughter.

'Also my solicitor for getting the result the family wanted and also to Clare Culpin for being there on 24 hour support to answer every question I have asked about Victoria's death.

'Victoria was a wonderful girl loved by many and will be greatly missed.

'May Victoria's legacy go on at Kettering Hospital so no other family have to go through the heartache of losing a loved one and feel the pain we feel for the rest of our lives missing our beautiful Victoria.'

Let down: 'Tor', as she was known to her family, texted her fianc√© with a picture of a blood-soaked T-shirt because she was scared

Clare Culpin, Director of Nursing and Quality at Kettering General Hospital, also issued an apology to the family and revealed a number of staff had been disciplined following the case.

She said: 'I would like to start by saying to Victoria's parents, family, and friends, on behalf of Kettering General Hospital, we are very sorry.

'Victoria's death led to a very thorough serious incident investigation being carried out by this hospital.

'That investigation identified a number of recommendations and led to some disciplinary action.

'As a result the hospital has committed to some significant changes to practice and patient care.'
