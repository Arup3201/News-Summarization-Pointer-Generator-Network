Dumped: Gary Dobson, one of the men who killed black teenager Stephen Lawrence in Eltham, south east London, in 1993

One of the men who killed black teenager Stephen Lawrence in a racist attack which changed Britain has been dumped by the mother of his children.

Gary Dobson's split from Michelle Lines, the mother of his two sons, after 10 years, was announced in a Facebook message made on his behalf.

She is said to have left him for a new man, two years after he and David Norris were convicted and jailed for the racist murder of teenager Stephen in 1993.

A message posted to Facebook on Dobson's behalf, seen by the Sunday Mirror, said he and Michelle had broken up 'amicably'.

'She has since met somebody,' the message continued. 'A fellow who I kind of knew and got on well with. As for names and details they are to remain private. Thank you, Gary.'

Dobson and Ms Lines, both 39, lived in Swanley, Kent, with their two sons, now aged eight and six, as well as a child from Dobson's previous relationship. 

During his Old Bailey trial she was a regular in the public gallery, waving lovingly at Dobson; and as the jury prepared to consider their verdict, he blew a kiss to her.

Dobson was first arrested 15 days after Stephen Lawrence was chased down and stabbed to death in the street in Eltham, south-east London.

He was one of five white youths, all alleged to be members of the same street gang, who were charged with Stephen's murder, but the charges were then subsequently dropped by the CPS.

Famous front page: The Mail openly accused the suspects in Stephen's killing and dared them to sue

When Stephen's parents Doreen and Neville Lawrence launched their own private prosecution in 1994, Dobson was among the three acquitted of murder at the Old Bailey.

Also jailed: David Norris, another of the original five suspects, is serving 14 years behind bars for his part in Stephen's murder

On 14 February 1997, on a famous front page, the Daily Mail labelled Dobson, Norris and three other suspects 'murderers'. 

The headline read, 'Murderers: The Mail accuses these men of killing. If we are wrong, let them sue us.' Beneath it appeared pictures of Dobson, Norris, Neil and Jamie Acourt, and Luke Knight.

None of the men ever sued for defamation and strong public opinions rose against the accused and the police who handled the case.

In 1999 the McPherson report into the Metropolitan Police's handling of the case found a litany of failures and accused the force of 'institutional racism'. 

Dobson worked as a bricklayer and labourer at building sites across London, but at the time of his re-arrest for Stephen's murder he was serving a five-year sentence for drug dealing.

He was finally convicted in 2007, after a cold case review found 'new and substantial evidence' and his original acquittal was quashed in the court of appeal.

He is now serving a minimum of 15 years behind bars, while Norris serves a minimum of 14 years, for what the judge described as a 'terrible and evil crime'. 

Stephen's mother Doreen was made a Labour peer last year in recognition of her long-running fight for justice for her son.
