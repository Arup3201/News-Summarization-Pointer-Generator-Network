Another year, another Arsenal captain bidding farewell to north London. Thomas Vermaelen became the fifth current skipper to leave the club in the past nine years when he joined Barcelona, following Patrick Vieira, Thierry Henry, Cesc Fabregas and Robin van Persie's departures. 

With new captain Mikel Arteta already into the last year of his contract, it does not bode well for the Spaniard's chances of staying at the Emirates beyond next summer.

Arsene Wenger's willingness to sell his skippers - assets that should, traditionally, be at the very heart of any football club - betrays the Frenchman's lack of sentimentality, but also the lack of regard in which the Arsenal manager holds the position.

He did not strip Vermaelen of the club captaincy last season although the Belgian made only 21 appearances, initially owing to a stress fracture in his back, while he seemed to think it insignificant that another player, usually Arteta, would wear the armband on the pitch in the defender's absence.

Questions about captaincy generally merit one of Wenger's quizzical looks, as he ponders why people brought up on Bobby Moore, John McGovern or Bryan Robson are making such a fuss about an armband on a shirt sleeve.

But it does matter. Old-fashioned though it may seem, you want there to be honour in an individual being chosen to be the captain of your football club. 

At Arsenal, however, the role has been diminished to the point where it was fitting the club ended their trophy drought by winning the FA Cup at Wembley last May with their long-term captain, Vermaelen, as an unused substitute.

It is not just at Arsenal, of course, but across English football at many football clubs. The England captain's armband has long been devalued; tossed haphazardly between one-cap wonders during dismally dull friendlies or given, sentimentally, to players who have reached a milestone number of appearances for their country. 

This is very sweet, but it shows that, contrary to what we might like to believe, the captain's armband is ultimately just a piece of cloth tied around a player's shirt sleeve.

There are no special privileges for a football captain in the Laws of the Game, after all, merely an expectation that they work with the referee and take responsibility for their team's behaviour. 

Players look to their manager or coaches on the sidelines for tactical direction, unlike on a cricket pitch, and so a football captain's role is largely ceremonial or inspirational. You would hope it still means something, though, otherwise what's the point of having a captain at all?

They meet the referee with the team-sheet an hour before kick-off, and should act as a pathway between players and management and, ideally, between the club and its fans. This may be as simple as the ghosted, largely anodyne notes that appear every fortnight in the matchday programme under the captain's name, or fronting up to the television cameras or written press when things are not going so well. 

It could also be things that help make team-mates' lives easier: Joey Barton recalls requesting six new plugs for the players' baths when he was made captain at QPR, to save them trying to clog up the holes with toilet paper.

These varied roles, however, make it a particularly difficult task if the club captain is not a guaranteed starter. How can he act as a go-between if he is worried about his place in the squad or not on the pitch at all? This concern now affects a manager's choice of captain more than, perhaps, their suitability as a leader. Some Arsenal fans, for instance, have suggested Aaron Ramsey or Jack Wilshere should have been chosen this time around, but their relative youth has prompted Wenger to look elsewhere.

By picking talismanic players such as Henry, Fabregas and Van Persie to wear the armband in the past, the captaincy became something the Arsenal boss did not really have to think about. 

His captain led the team out, invariably scored or put in a match-winning performance, and that was that. When Wenger abandoned this model, with William Gallas and then Vermaelen, the captaincy suddenly became an issue again; an issue Wenger does not want or particularly recognise as important in the grand scheme of running a football club.

Consequently, it is not since Patrick Vieira in 2005 that Arsenal have had a captain who really seemed to define the honour, in the traditional sense of how we want our captains to be. Sadly, that has been sold off a long time ago.
