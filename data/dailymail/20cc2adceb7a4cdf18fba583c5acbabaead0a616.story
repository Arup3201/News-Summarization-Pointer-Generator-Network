An American banker accused of sexually assaulting a wedding guest has been cleared after she said she did not want to give evidence against him for a second time.

Ed Sappin, 39, allegedly targeted the woman during a party at the bride’s flat in Hampstead, north-west London after the ceremony.

When she woke up to find him kissing her, she screamed so loudly that neighbours alerted police, Blackfriars Crown Court heard.

But after nearly nine hours of 
deliberation, Judge Ian Karsten QC discharged a jury when they were 
unable to reach a verdict in his trial last month.

Family support: Sappin was flanked at Blackfriars Magistrate Court by wife Jan Hua and his mother, Susan

Sappin
was due to be retried but prosecutor Andrew Dowden told the court: ‘The
Crown have reviewed the case and spoken to the complainant, who does 
not wish to return to court.

‘We offer no evidence and invite the court to enter a not guilty verdict’.

Sappin,
a married father-of-two, told the court the woman had consented to 
sexual activity and he stopped when she became distressed.

'She
was moaning while we were kissing... she still seemed to be enjoying 
herself but after a couple of minutes I stopped and basically went back 
to laying beside her,’ he said.

'She suddenly just from one moment to the next got extremely upset.

‘I was feeling around her legs.

‘She kind of just got up in bed just like she was very, very upset and I was shocked and I said ‘I’m sorry’.

Charges dropped: Sappin, 39, allegedly targeted the woman during a party at the bride's flat after a wedding. His wife wrote a statement to court saying she completely trusted her husband and was there to support him

'I honestly had no idea what was going on.

'I was just very shocked and at the same time I saw she was in distress and wanted to try and calm her down.

'I
was very upset - number one, that she was upset. Number two, that I am a
married man and I shouldn’t have been in that room’, Sappin said.

The police arrived after a neighbour was disturbed by the woman’s hysterical screams, the court heard.

'I saw a police officer which was very surprising to me,’ said Sappin. 'I really was just surprised and didn’t know exactly what was going on.'

'I thought I had basically just ruined their wedding weekend so I felt horrible.'

'I honestly had no idea what was going on. I was just very shocked and at the same time I saw she was in distress and wanted to try and calm her down... I saw a police officer, which was very surprising to me'

Sappin accepted he could not see the woman’s face during the 20-minute encounter in a darkened room but said she was awake as he could hear her moans.

His wife Jan Hua said in a written statement that she is standing by her husband.

'I have complete confidence and trust in him,’ she said.

'I believe this event is out of character.

'This matter is difficult for any man to disclose but he told me about it with candour.

'He is a good person, with tremendous respect for women and others in general’, the statement read.

His mother, Susan, gave evidence in her son’s defence, describing him as ‘gentle, thoughtful and caring’.

'He is kind...he is very very accepting, very tolerant of people of all backgrounds, all nations and all walks of life.

'I always consider Ed a very decent human being’, Mrs Sappin said.

The banker made his name as a finance expert after working for several leading US companies.

The self-described ‘innovation junkie’, is now chief executive of The Willowbrook Company, which focuses on investing in renewable energy.

Sappin, of North Fifth Street, Brooklyn, New York, denied one count of sexual assault on October 21 last year.
