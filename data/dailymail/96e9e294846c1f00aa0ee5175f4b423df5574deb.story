A family of gypsies told to remove mobile homes erected in a countryside beauty spot have taken their battle to keep them to the High Court.

Jimmy and Christoper Searle and their families moved into a three-acre plot of land near to South Harting, West Sussex in 2009.

The plot, which the family bought for £120,000, falls within the picturesque South Downs National Park.

Controversial: Jimmy and Christoper Searle and their families erected two mobile homes at their three-acre plot of land near to South Harting, West Sussex

In February this year villagers were horrified after being told by police to move their cars to make way for a prefabricated mobile home that featured fake bricks and slate roof.

Now, the plot has two mobile homes and a touring caravan parked on it.

Chichester District Council served an enforcement notice on the Searles in order to get the mobile homes removed from the plot.

But the family lodged an appeal, which was thrown out by Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles who stated the mobile homes 'unacceptably harms' the beauty of the village.

Outstanding: The Searles' plot, which the family bought for £120,000, falls within the picturesque South Downs National Park

Removal: Chichester District Council served an enforcement notice on the Searles in order to get the mobile homes removed from the plot, which the family have appealed against

Thrown out: The appeal was thrown out by Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles who stated the mobile homes 'unacceptably harms' the beauty of the village. The family have now taken their battle to the High Court

But the Searles, unhappy to leave the argument there, called Mr Pickles decision 'fundamentally unfair' and took their battle to the High Court.

Yesterday the family's barrister Timothy Jones told the hearing that Mr Pickles did not deal with the Searles' appeal accordingly.

He said the Secretary's decision was entirely different to that of a qualified Government-appointed planning inspector, who visited the Searles' site.

He added that Mr Pickles acted with an 'unfairness that will become apparent', the Daily Express reported.

It is understood that Mr Pickles did not visit the site before throwing the appeal out.

Mr Jones argued that with no photographic evidence to show how the Searles had made some effort to screen their site off, Mr Pickles was ill equipped to make a decision.

The hearing continues.
