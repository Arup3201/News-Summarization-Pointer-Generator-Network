Two decades after her mother kidnapped her as a baby and made them fugitives across five continents, Savanna Todd faces separation from the woman she desperately loves and forgives.

As Dorothy Lee Barnett is held among thieves and drug dealers at Brisbane Women's Correctional Centre in Queensland, Australia, her 20-year-old  daughter Savanna says she supports her mother’s actions.

In an exclusive interview with Today Tonight, which screens tonight at 6.30pm on Channel 7, Savanna – now a university student who goes by the name of Samantha Geldenhuys – says her mother should be given a chance to explain what she did.

Grown-up: Savanna Todd only discovered her past when the police knocked on the door to arrest her mother Dorothy Lee Barnett

Secret past: Savanna knew nothing about her wealthy father or that the FBI had an international warrant out on her mother

Dorothy Barnett, 53, faces up to more than a decade in a U.S. prison if convicted of alleged U.S. federal crimes.

But as the story of their life on the run using a string of aliases and staying ahead of an international manhunt makes global headlines, the young woman at the centre of the storm has pleaded her mother’s  case.

'I backed my Mum on the first day because I knew who she was and I knew what she did would be for a valid reason,' she said. ‘I was brought up not to judge until I see fit.

'I’ve always had a mother. I’ve always been loved. I’ve always been protected. I’ve read her side. I’ve read all the docs and I feel that she needs to be heard.’

In 1994, then an 11-month-old baby, Savanna Todd was living with her parents in Charleston, South Carolina.

Fugitive: Dorothy Lee Barnett pictured in the US before she kidnapped her daughter and began her life on the run

Dorothy Barnett, a flight attendant, had married Benjamin Harris Todd in December 1991, but the relationship foundered amid accusations of violence and her desire to have a child.

Barnett filed for divorce in February 1993, alleging in court documents that Todd had left her because he was angry about her being pregnant, reports The Post and Courier

Todd accused Barnett of physically and emotionally abusing him, winning temporary custody of their then unborn daughter after psychiatric tests showed Barnett to be bi-polar

In a little-seen interview with Columbia Journalism School from 2009, Todd – now a successful investment banker who lives in the exclusive ocean-side S.C. suburb of Isle of Palms - said he cited 'physical cruelty' by Barnett in his divorce papers.

He said their marriage was impromptu, with a planned vacation to the Bahamas quickly refashioned as a honeymoon, and that soon after his wife his wife turned violent.

Todd alleged Barnett would attack him while driving in their car

'I've never hit a woman in my life,' Todd said. 'I can't explain why I let myself be hit.'

He said she wouldn't sleep for 'seven or eight days at a stretch' and she would 'beat her head against a wall for what seemed like hours’.

One night, he awoke to find her lying in a fetal position on the floor, staring at nothing, rocking back and forth. He went into hiding and would sometimes sleep in his car.

‘I was on the run from her, hiding out at friends' houses,’ Todd said. ‘She'd drive around all night, looking for me, and sometimes she'd find me. She'd stand outside the house and scream that she was going to kill herself.’

Barnett was diagnosed with manic depression - now largely classified as bi-polar disorder - but refused to get treatment.

Barnett's lawyer, Mendell Rivers, said Barnett's 'tragic lack of self-control' in the court room lead the judge to believe the accusations were true.

In court she claimed Todd was evil and she suspected he was homosexual.

But the stress of the trial and the stress of being a mother was 'too much for her to handle', Rivers said.

Savanna Todd was born on May 6, 1993.

Her father was granted sole custody, with Barnett allowed two supervised weekend visits a month.

But during a court-supervised visit in April 1994, mother and daughter left for a birthday party without an escort. According to a police report, they never returned.

The same month they disappeared, the FBI obtained a warrant for Barrett’s arrest.

Barnett had left behind a map of South America, however according to Queensland news reports, she initially fled to South Africa, where she married a man, Juan Geldenhuys, in 1995.

She gave birth to a son, now 17, before moving to New Zealand and becoming a citizen.

Five years ago, she settled in Australia after splitting with Mr Geldenhuys, who recently died of bone cancer.

During her alleged time on the run, Barnett used aliases such as Alexandria Maria Canton, federal authorities said, to evade detection.

Once in March 2003 and again in March 2004, Barnett used her new name, Alexandria Maria Geldenhuys, to attempt to get a U.S. passport, according to the indictment against her.

Then and now: Savanna Harris Todd has remained a missing person for 19 years after being kidnapped by her mother in April 1994. Pictures of her as a baby (left) were used to create impressions of what she might look like today (right)

Court papers say Savanna's father was the one who led authorities to his ex-wife.

An Australian friend of Mr Geldenhuys, Barnett's second husband, had grown suspicious of her.

He heard Barnett call her daughter Savanna and she had previously spoken about escaping an abusive relationship.

A simple internet search provided old photos of Barnett as wanted in relation to the disappearance of Savanna, and the Australian man was able to contact Benjamin Harris Todd.

Life on the run came to an end on November 4 last year when, at the behest of the FBI, the Australian Federal Police arrested her on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland, where she and Savanna had been living under several aliases.

Most astonished of all was Savanna herself.

On the day police knocked on her mother’s door she woke up to a different name, identity and past.

The vivacious nursing student and skilled lifesaver knew herself as Samantha Geldenhuys, and knew nothing of the fact she had a wealthy and successful father who lived in America.

But Savanna-Samantha did not harbour any resentment towards her mother, and to this day believes she has done nothing wrong.

‘A name does not change who you are,’ Samantha tells Today Tonight.

‘I’ve always had a mother. I’ve always been loved. I’ve always been protected. I don't feel I have an identity crisis, when I was told I was Savanna Todd or Savannah Barnett, or whatever alias.'

‘Savanna can be a remembrance of what happened 20 years ago but Samantha is who I am and who I will be.’

Barnett was charged with international parental kidnapping and two counts of false statement in a passport application and taken immediately into custody where she has remained since.

Savanna was by her mother’s side at Barnett’s first court appearance, where she held up a sign saying ‘We love you Mom’.

According to The Australian, Barnett, who 'winked' back at her daughter, was supported by more than two dozen people, some of whom had sworn affidavits attesting to her good character.

Barnett's barrister, Jeff Hunter QC, unsuccessfully applied for bail, saying  his client was not a flight risk and had a close and special relationship with the Sunshine Coast community.

She has maintained a job while in Australia and managed to get a mortgage on her home.

According to Today Tonight, Savanna is a ‘courageous , intelligent young woman with an extraordinary resolve to see justice done’.

‘This story is a riveting rollercoaster of emotions and intrigue,’ said Today Tonight executive producer Max Uechtritz.

‘It's got it all: the FBI, an international manhunt, fugitives on the run across four countries and two decades, an ultimate betrayal and now the highly-charged consequences.

‘It's a compelling tale of a mother's fierce, protective love, now reciprocated by her little girl.  Samantha is determined that the truth gets out about why her mother was forced to do what did.

‘We've  forensically examined hundreds  of pages of evidence from the original custodial court case and spoken to multiple key witnesses who still say their testimony was ignored or dismissed.’

Barnett will next appear at an extradition hearing in a Queensland court.

It is expected she will be extradited back to the United States to face her charges.

If convicted, Barnett could spend three years in prison on the kidnapping charge and 10 years on each of the two passport counts.
