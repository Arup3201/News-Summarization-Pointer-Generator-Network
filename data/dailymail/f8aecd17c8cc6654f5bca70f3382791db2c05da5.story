Three white teens have been charged with race hate crimes after allegedly tying a noose around the neck of a black classmate and calling him 'n*****'.

The trio, reportedly annoyed with the boy's relationship with a white girl, then allegedly threatened the 17-year-old with a knife.

The teens - students at Brother Rice High School in Chicago, Illinois - were friends with victim Joshua Merritt before they turned on him, Fox reported.

The boy, along with a 17-year-old and 18-year-old, then allegedly began hitting Merritt before picking up a thick rope.

'[The 16-year-old] walks over to me, with the noose in his hand, he comes puts the noose around my neck and he beings to tighten the noose, almost strangled me to the ground,' MrÂ  Merritt said.

He told police that his attackers repeatedly yelled 'n*****', threatened to kill him and refused to let him leave.

When he finally escaped the home, the 16-year-old attacked him again, he said.

'The same guy that put me to the ground earlier comes up to me with a knife, from behind me,' Merritt told Fox News. 'And said, "Stop talking to my cousin, you're annoying her. If you don't stop I'm going to kill you".'

The victim told his family about the attack and they complained to school officials, who continue to investigate the alleged attack.

One of the alleged attackers, Matthew Hermann, 18, of Alsip, Illinois, has been charged as an adult.

Hermann, who graduated the high school last year, was charged with unlawful restraint, hate crime and misdemeanor battery.

The two other suspects face the same charges in juvenile court, while the 16-year-old was also charged with aggravated assault with a dangerous weapon.

Yet his mother has branded the allegations as lies.

The president of Brother Rice said the 17-year-old told staff the attack was just horseplay that went too far, Fox reported.
