As a former chairman of Standard Chartered bank, he was a mover and a shaker in the City.

After serving as Trade Minister in Gordon Brown’s government and being made a peer, Mervyn Davies lists his hobbies in Who’s Who as soccer, cricket, golf, rugby, Welsh art and antiques.

But the 62-year-old clearly enjoys a bit of a boogie on the dance floor too – and is not afraid to strut his stuff in front of international pop star Usher either.

Baron Davies of Abersoch threw himself into an eye-catching routine at the Arts Club in Mayfair, London, where the Grammy award-winning American R&B singer hosted a party after visiting the Royal Academy of Arts to present a special event to support its learning programme.

Labour peer Lord Mervyn Davies performed an energetic dance routine during a party held in honour of R&B singer Usher last night

Usher had been speaking at the Royal Academy as part of a charity event, attended by Lord Davies as part of his role as chairman of the Royal Academy Trust 

At one point the peer, who is chairman of the Royal Academy Trust was even seen lying back on the floor, hands apparently raised to play an air guitar.  

Lord Davies, who is a member of the Welsh government's financial and professional services sector advisory panel, also looked to have perfected the 'running man' move as he took to the dance floor at Burlington House in London.

And while his new friend looked relaxed in a pair of jeans and a tartan-print leather jacket, Lord Davies's formal blue suit did not impede his dance floor antics.

But Usher, who was perhaps saving his energy for the final gig of his tour at the O2 tonight, was keen to let Lord Davies take the limelight, preferring to kick back with a cup of tea while others enjoyed the musical entertainment.

The singer, 36, who has sold millions of records since bursting onto the music scene in the 1990s, was at the Royal Academy to speak to young people from charity Kids Company about his career and his charity work with his New Look Foundation.

He shared a stage with the politician as they spoke to the assembled guests at a party after Usher's address, before sharing a warm hug and posing up for photographs.
