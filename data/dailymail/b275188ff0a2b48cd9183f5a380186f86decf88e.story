The destruction of Brazil's Amazon rainforest has slowed to its lowest level since monitoring began, it was announced yesterday.

Satellite images showed that 1,798 square miles of the Amazon were slashed and burned between August 2011 and July 2012, said Brazil's environment minister Izabella Teixeira.

That's 27 per cent less than the 2,478 square miles cut down a year earlier.

Smoke billows as flames burn trees in the Amazon rainforest: Brazil today announced that the rate of deforestation in the Amazon has fallen to its lowest levels since records began

Brazil's National Institute for Space Research said the rate of deforestation is the lowest since it started taking measurements in 1988.

The Amazon constitutes more than half of the planet's remaining rainforest, and it is also the largest and most species-rich tract of tropical rainforest in the world.

Brazil contains 63 per cent of the vast rainforest's 2.4million square miles.

The space institute said the latest figures show Brazil is close to its 2020 target of reducing deforestation by 80 per cent from 1990 levels.

Through to July 2012 rates of deforestation have dropped by 76.26 per cent.

George Pinto a director of Ibama, Brazil's environmental protection agency, said stricter enforcement of environmental laws and improved surveillance technology are behind the drop in deforestation levels.

The destruction of the Amazon began in earnest in the Sixties with farmers slashing and burning forests to make space for crop cultivation.

Colonists found soils were only productive for a limited time, spurring them to clear more and more forest and causing widespread environmental damage. However, even before the introduction of large scale agriculture, humans have long had an impact on the Amazon basin.

Archaeological evidence suggests the first inhabitants settled the region at least 11,200 years ago, and by 1500AD some 5million people may have lived in the region.

Francisco de Orellana, the first European to travel along the Amazon river, reported a complex civilisation flourishing on its banks in the 1540s.

Other evidence suggests the forests, rather than being pristine wilderness, have in fact been shaped by man for at least 11,000 years through practices like forest gardening.

Terra preta (black earth), which is distributed over large areas in the Amazon, is now widely accepted as a product of soil management indicating portions of the forest are the result of centuries of human shaping.

It is thought many of the region's original indigenous inhabitants were wiped out by the spread of diseases like smallpox carried by European explorers.

Mr Pinto said that in the 12-month period a total of 2,000 square meters of illegally felled timber were seized by government agents.

The impounded lumber is sold in auctions and the money obtained is invested in environmental preservation programs.

Ms Teixeira said Brazil will next year start using satellite monitoring technology to detect illegal logging and slash-and-burn activity and issue fines.

Adalberto Verissimo, a senior researcher at Imazon, an environmental watchdog agency, said: 'Over the past several years Brazil has made a huge effort to contain deforestation and the latest figures testify to its success.

'The deforestation figures are extremely positive, for they point to a consistent downward trend.'

'The numbers disprove the argument that deforestation is necessary for the country's economy to grow', he said by telephone from his office in the Amazon city of Belem.

'Deforestation has been dropping steadily for the past four years while the economy has grown,' he said

'But the war is far from over. We still have a lot of battles to fight and win.'

Marcio Astrini, Greenpeace coordinator in the Amazon region, said the lower figures show that reducing deforestation is perfectly possible.

But he added that 'the numbers are still too high for a country that does not have to destroy one single hectare in order to develop.'
