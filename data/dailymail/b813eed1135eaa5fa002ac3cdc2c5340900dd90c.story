Lucan Battison was suspended from a New Zealand Catholic school after he refused to cut his long curly hair but he can keep his hairstyle after winning his fight in the high court today

A student has won his High Court battle to keep his hair long after he was suspended from school because he looked 'unruly'.

Lucan Battison, 16, was sent home last month from St. John's College, in Hastings, New Zealand, for not adhering to the rule that states students must keep their hair ‘short, tidy, off their collars and out of their eyes’.

Principal Paul Melloy told Lucan he could return once he had his hair cut - but the student argued his naturally curly hair would look 'boofy' if cropped and he was prepared to wear it tied back in order to comply with the school's standards.

But New Zealand High Court Judge David Collins ruled that Lucan’s actions did not warrant suspension as his conduct was not harmful to his fellow students.

He also said the school had not provided enough clarity on the hair rules to ensure students complied with them.

When the case began, the teen’s lawyer, Jol Bates, likened Lucan to Martin Luther King Jr for standing up for his rights.

Judge Collins made a point of commenting on Lucan’s character, noting he received a civil bravery award in March for participating in the rescue of two young women who nearly drowned in dangerous ocean conditions.

He also mentioned that Lucan represented St. John's in rugby and loved attending the school, in part because 'his faith was important to him'.

Meanwhile, although the school did not approve of Lucan’s hairstyle, it described him as a ‘nice young man’.

Judge Collins said that one of Lucan’s lawyers had tried to provide the school board's disciplinary committee with statements from two hairdressers, one of whom said Lucan's hair was already short and would ‘look like "an untidy afro'' if it was cut shorter,’ but that the committee apparently chose not to accept the testimony.

Parents Troy Battison and Tania Doidge said in a statement that their son had never broken the rules because his bun kept his hair off his collar and out of his eyes.

'In 2014, when girls' hair lengths at school aren't questioned, why should the rules be different for boys?' his parents said. 'The criticism we have received as parents has been hurtful and unnecessary.'

In a statement issued by the school, Mr Melloy said the school was naturally disappointed about the decision made in Wellington.

‘The Board of Trustees are taking time to consider the judgment made by Justice Collins in terms of its impact, both on our school and on other schools,’ it said.

Mr Bates said his client was standing up for his basic human rights, challenging authority and following in the footsteps of Martin Luther King Jr

Mr Bates said Lucan had been sporting the same hairstyle since he became a student at the Catholic college three years ago
