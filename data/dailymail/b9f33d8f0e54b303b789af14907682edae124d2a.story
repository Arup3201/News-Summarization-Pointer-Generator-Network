On one side, there are dilapidated houses, gardens overflowing with weeds and a high crime rate.

On the other, there are streets filled with spacious homes, well-manicured lawns and yoga studios.

This is one of numerous fences that have been erected by the wealthy 'haves' of the Michigan suburb of Grosse Pointe Park to 'prevent 'have-nots' from Detroit from driving into the city.

The brick barrier, reading 'Road Ends', represents a significant divide between the two cities, which despite their proximity, differ greatly in terms of average salary, crime rates and general desirability.

No entry: Five roads that should connect Detroit with the rich suburb Grosse Pointe Park are cut off, including Kercheval Avenue, where Grosse Pointe Park authorities recently built a traffic barrier

In Detroit, the median household income is just $26,955 - with many of the poorest residents taking home much less - compared to a  higher $101,094 in Grosse Pointe Park, according to the LA Times.

Similarly, the Motor City last year declared the largest municipal bankruptcy in American history, while its neighbor's quaint shops, beer gardens and antiques stores are thriving with residents.

And in relation to crime rate, Detroit's Precinct 4 takes an average of 30 minutes to respond to an incident, while Grosse Pointe Park police typically arrive in just 3.4.

This is perhaps unsurprising considering that Detroit, once the industrial capital of the nation, was voted the most dangerous city in the country in 2012, for the fourth year in a row.

The city, left ravaged by dwindling blue-collar jobs, the decline of the auto industry and rising unemployment, was found by Forbes to have a violent crime rate of 2,137 per 100,000 residents.

It has lost more than 200,000 residents in the last decade - and 1.3million since the 1950s - as citizens have fled the blighted city for better-off suburbs with lower crime and better education.

Worlds apart: The barriers (including these yellow ones) represent a significant divide between the two cities, which despite their proximity, differ greatly in terms of average salary, crime rates and general desirability

But Forbes pointed out that even with the population drop, there were 344 murders in 2011, compared with 395 in 2001.  

There are also racial discrepancies between Detroit and Grosse Pointe Park, with around 85 per cent of the former's residents being white, compared to 82 per cent of Detroit's locals being black.

Earlier this year, the 'haves' of Grosse Pointe Park erected a fence on Kercheval Road, one of the few streets via which drivers can access Detroit.

Officials claimed it was set up for a farmers' market, but the move sparked anger among Detroit residents. And last winter, the suburb  allegedly deliberately plowed snow to form another barrier.

'There's so much tension between the suburbs and the city in Wayne County,' Kevin Boyle, a Detroit native, told the newspaper.

'I think they're very determined to try and insulate themselves from the cost of the bankruptcy. The suburbs are terrified by the thought that they'd be caught up in Detroit's problem.' 

The tension is such that at the five Grosse Pointe municipalities, dubbed 'the Pointes', residents must show an ID to enter public parks. 

But despite the suburb's pristine exterior, it is also undergoing financial problems, with budget cuts and decreasing house prices forcing some to cross back over the border.

It has also been reported that newly-elected Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan has now signed a deal with Grosse Pointe Park that could help ease the tensions.

In accordance with the deal, Detroit will tear down some of the dilapidated houses around the border, while Grosse Pointe Park will remove the 'haves/have-nots' fences in return, it is said. 

In the booming post-Second World War era, Detroit was America's fifth-largest city, boasting an enormous population of 1,850,000 in 1950.

It was given its Motor City name by General Motors Co, Chrysler and Ford Motor Co, but in the 1970s and 80s, the auto industry suffered setbacks that impacted heavily on Detroit.

Many Americans feel the city's road back from ruin will require a dedicated joint effort between the state government and citizens.
