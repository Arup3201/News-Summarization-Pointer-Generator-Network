Every day, Sportsmail takes a look at the European papers to see what are the biggest stories creating talking points on the continent.

The news that is plastered over the front page of Spanish daily Mundo Deportivo today is that Manchester United and Barcelona target Juan Cuadrado will cost any buyer €50million.

This will come to both suitors of the Colombian World Cup star and Louis van Gaal will have to dig deep into his transfer budget if United are to further their interest.

Should Real fail to seal a deal within a week, Navas would have to return to training with his current club Levante - something he isn't keen on after making no secret of his wish to join the European champions.

Meanwhile, Casillas is set to start in Madrid's friendly with Roma in the early hours of Wednesday morning - and Marca hail the return of the Galacticos on their front page, also picking up on Sergio Ramos, Xabi Alonso and Luka Modric's comebacks.
