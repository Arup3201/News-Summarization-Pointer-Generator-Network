A pensioner has walked free from the mangled wreckage of her car after it flipped through the air and wedged itself against the side of a house.

The 80-year-old escaped without serious injury after she is believed to have lost control on a bend on a dark country road, in Bradninch near Exeter, Devon.

The vehicle was sent careering up a grass verge, hurtling through a hedge before it plummeted 15ft and landed in the narrow gully between a house and a low brick wall.

A pensioner has walked free from the mangled wreckage of her car after it flipped through the air and wedged itself against the side of a house in Exeter, Devon

The vehicle was sent careering up a grass verge, hurtling through a hedge before it plummeted 15ft and landed in the narrow gully between a house and a low brick wall

Homeowner John Davies, 47, who was sitting just the other side of the wall, said he heard a huge 'thud' at around 10.30pm on Monday and dashed outside.

He found the Vauxhall Agila wedged on its side against his home with the elderly motorist trapped inside.

Mr Davies raised the alarm and firefighters and paramedics arrived to rescue the shaken OAP who was taken to hospital but she had no serious injuries.

Remarkably the house also escaped any serious damage.

Mr Davies was waiting yesterday for a crane to come and remove the crumpled car.

His partner Justine Alecho said: 'I was at work when I got a call from John to say there had been an accident. I was scared stiff but he was all right.

'The car was upside down and seems to have just shot through the hedge into the house.

'John was sitting at his computer doing some work when it just landed out of nowhere and finished up just outside his studio window with the poor woman trapped inside.

'Another few feet and it could have been so very different. It just shows you that you never know what is around the corner.

'John called the police and ambulance and they were here very quickly. He was shocked but is OK now.'

The crushed interior of the car shows how lucky the pensioner was to escape uninjured

Devon and Cornwall Police confirmed the elderly driver, a local woman, was not hurt in the accident.

She was taken to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital by ambulance before being discharged.

A spokesman said: 'The car has driven through trees, landed on its side and embedded itself four feet below ground level.

'The driver went to hospital to be checked over but was fine.'
