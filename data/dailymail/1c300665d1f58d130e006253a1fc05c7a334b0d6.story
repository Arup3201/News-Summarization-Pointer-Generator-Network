The cyberattack on Sony Pictures that released the social security numbers, salary details and other secrets of 47,000 employees originated from a $250-per-night, five-star hotel in Bangkok, Thailand, it was revealed today.

Bloomberg News  has revealed new details of the attack, which has shaken the Hollywood studio to its core. Nearly all of the signs point to North Korean hackers being behind the network invasion. 

The reclusive hermit regime in Pyongyang has denied being behind the cyberattack, but released a statement Sunday saying that it may have been a 'righteous deed of the supporters and sympathizers' of North Korea. 

The St. Regis Bangkok is a glittery five-star luxury hotel in the Thai city's richest shopping district. Authorities say they have traced the attack to the hotel's internet network

The St. Regis has rooms that start at $250 a night and go up to $10,600 for the penthouse suite, which comes with its own butler

The North Korean statement also made reference to Sony Pictures producing 'The Interview,' a comedy that stars Seth Rogen and James Franco as talk show hosts who try to assassinate North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. 

It has been speculated that Sony was targeted because of the film, which is set to be released on Christmas Day. 

Bloomberg reports that investigators have traced the attack last weekend back to the St. Regis Bangkok hotel, a five-star resort in Thailand's capital.  

Authorities are not sure whether the hackers stayed as guests at the hotel, simply used the wifi in the lobby, or routed the traffic through the hotel. The luxury resort has rooms starting at $250 per night, going up to the penthouse suite, which features a private pool and a personal butler for $10,600 a night.

The attack on Sony Pictures may have been the result of the studio producing 'The Interview,' which is a comedy about an assassination attempt on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un

North Korea has already reacted angrily to 'The Interview,' which stars James Franco and Seth Rogen

The St. Regis Bangkok is owned by Starwood Hotels and Resorts, a Connecticut-based company that also owns Westin, Sheraton and the W hotel chains. 

The St. Regis, a glittering high-rise hotel, is located on Rajadmari Road in a section of Bangkok known for its high-end boutiques for the likes of Bulgari and Valentino.

Sources tell Bloomberg that forensic evidence indicates that the Sony attack was carried out by the same hackers who pulled off the DarkSeoul cyber assault of South Korean banks and media companies in 2013. 

The DarkSeoul hackers were linked to North Korea, which employs at least 5,900 hackers - many of whom operate outside the country, where electricity is unreliable and internet access is scarce.

According to details released by the FBI, key pieces of the malware used in the attack have the same names and construction as the malware used in the DarkSeoul attack. 

In both attacks, hackers also defaced websites with skeletons and political slogans.
