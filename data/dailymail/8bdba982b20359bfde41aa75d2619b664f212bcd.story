This is the terrifying moment a swarm of angry bees attacked a drone as it flew over Miami Beach in Florida.

The drone quadcopter, fitted with a camera, was launched in a bid to capture a stunning aerial view of the coastal resort city.

But as soon as it soared above surrounding trees and homes, it was attacked by another type of drone: male honey bees.

Swarm: Footage captured by the drone shows the  bees darting above the coastal resort town in Florida

Footage captured by the aircraft shows the mass of bees darting through the air as the drone emits a loud whirring sound.

They continue to swarm around the drone as it makes its way over the Miami Beach neighborhood, before landing on a block of wood in a back garden.

Due to the aggressive nature and sheer number of drones protecting the hive, the bees are believed to be Africanized bees.

Known as 'killer bees', these insects exhibit certain behavioral traits that make them a threat to people and other animals, including excessive defensiveness and swarming.

Posing a threat: Africanized bees' behavioral traits can make them a threat to people and other animals

Although they were first introduced to Brazil in the 1950s in an effort to increase honey production,  26 swarms accidentally escaped quarantine in 1957.

Since then, the insects  have spread throughout South and Central America. They arrived in North America in 1985.

According to Skymark Productions, which launched the drone, a bee removal professional has  now inspected the hive.

They are planning to either relocate or destroy it.
