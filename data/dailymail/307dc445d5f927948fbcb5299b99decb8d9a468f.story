Nemaja Matic’s red card against Burnley on Saturday comes as a severe blow for Jose Mourinho’s Capital One Cup final plans.

The 26-year-old midfielder was sent off for pushing Burnley player forward Ashley Barnes following an awful challenge on the Serbian during the 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.

Barnes mistimed his challenge, catching Matic with his studs, but it was missed by referee Martin Atkinson who did not even give a free kick to the title challengers.

The Serbian international will now face a three game suspension for his antics, leaving a Matic shaped gap in Mourinho’s squad to face Tottenham at Wembley on Sunday.

Matic will also miss big games against London rivals West Ham and Champions League chasing Southampton as part of his suspension.

Chelsea have lost just three matches in all competitions this season and the Serbian powerhouse, who was signed from Portuguese outfit Benfica, was missing for two of them.

Matic was not in the squad when Chelsea lost their unbeaten record to Alan Pardew’s Newcastle in early December.

And he also sat out the embarrassing defeat to Bradford City in the FA Cup at Stamford Bridge back in January.

Chelsea have a win percentage of more than 70 per cent when Matic lines up in midfield which drops to just 33 per cent when he is not named in Mourinho's squad. 

The only taste of defeat Matic has tasted with the Blues this season was against London rivals Tottenham in a 5-3 goal fest at White Hart Lane.

Having Matic in the squad also lowers their goals against ratio to 0.8 goals a game whereas without the £22million signing Chelsea leak on average two goals a game.

Only fellow Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas has completed more passes than Matic this season.

The former Benfica midfielder has also won the most tackles in the Premier League - nine more than Crystal Palace defender Martin Kelly.

Burnley fan were obviously happy with the shift Barnes put in as the Clarets faithful voted him their Man of the Match during the draw at Stamford Bridge.

The club's official Twitter account posted the results to their poll this morning while Chelsea boss Mourinho was having a rant on Sky Sports.
