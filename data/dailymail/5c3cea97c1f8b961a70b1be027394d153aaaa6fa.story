In a speech to leading members of the Islamic community Prince Charles claimed President Assad's war against his own people was in part caused by drought and mishandling of the rural economy

Prince Charles courted controversy last night by blaming the Syrian conflict on mismanagement of the country’s natural resources.

In a speech to leading members of the Islamic community, he claimed President Assad’s bloody war against his own people was in part caused by drought and mishandling of the rural economy.

The prince blamed the same problem for other recent global conflicts, and although he did not name any in particular, many will take them to include Britain’s forays in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Charles, who recently sparked division
after hitting out at Britain’s ‘failing’ pensions industry, said: ’We 
are now grappling with all sorts of social and economic challenges that 
have their roots in a problem not acknowledged, which has contributed to
so many of the conflicts around the world in recent times.

‘And that is the way nature’s capital reserves have been depleted; things we take utterly for granted like water and soils.

‘If these deteriorate and are not managed
on a sustainable basis, this can cause direct impacts on food and 
energy security. The tragic conflict in Syria provides a terrifyingly 
graphic example, where a severe drought for the last seven years has 
decimated Syria’s rural economy, driving many farmers off their fields 
into the cities where, already, food was in short supply.

‘This depletion of natural capital, inexplicably little reported in the media, was a significant contributor to the social tension that exploded with such desperate results.’

Paul Flynn, a Labour MP and member of the Commons public administration committee, described the prince’s comments about the civil war, which has seen Syria’s despotic president kill tens of thousands of his own people, as ‘bizarre’. 

‘Again he is bordering on the eccentric with what is certainly a novel idea,’ he said.

‘He has spoken a great deal about national political issues in the past and it is surprising that he has strayed into international politics which is a very dangerous minefield indeed. This goes further than his usual obsessions. His job as head of state will be to be above politics and he should use the time until that happens to practice keeping his mouth shut.’

Charles has long been known for his outspoken views, but by straying into international politics, his speech to the World Islamic Economic Forum in London may be among his most controversial yet

Tory MP Peter Bone said: ‘Prince Charles has always been known for his blue-sky thinking, but I don’t go along with that analysis of the Syrian conflict. I think it’s quite clear from the Arab Spring what caused it, and it is that these people wanted to be free of dictatorship.

‘I’m not sure the environment is a contributory factor at all.’

An aide to the prince told the Mail last night: ‘The prince was making a point within the wider context of his speech about finance and certainly not claiming that this [the issue of rural mismanagement] was the only contributing factor to the Syrian conflict.’

Charles has long been known for his outspoken views, particularly over issues such as farming, the environment and architecture.

Charles said that the conflict in Syria provided a 'terrifyingly graphic example' of a severe drought having decimated the rural economy

But by straying into international politics, his speech to the World Islamic Economic Forum in London may be among his most controversial yet.

Saying the forum was sign of London’s ‘growing importance as a hub for Islamic Finance in the West’, he added: ‘You are meeting at an opportune moment and your efforts to establish bridges between cultures and countries could not be more important. 

‘We are currently confronting challenges that will define our civilization, not least the wise management of our planet in the face of climate change, the depletion of natural capital and a rising population. It is clear from the Koran and, indeed, from the Bible too, that humanity has a sacred responsibility for the stewardship of the Earth.’
