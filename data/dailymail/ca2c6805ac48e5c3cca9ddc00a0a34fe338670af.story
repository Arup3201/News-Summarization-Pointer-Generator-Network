Homeowners were fed up with their council's refusal to fix potholes outside their houses - so they ordered the tarmac and did it themselves.  

After a year long fight to fix 100 potholes on a 100 metre stretch of road, six pensioners, of Pudsey, Leeds, took matters into their own hands and repaired them themselves.

The men refused to take no for an answer when Leeds City Council highways bosses declined to carry out the work on the basis it is a private unadopted road.

So the neighbours, with an average age of 75, ordered a ton of tarmac and set to work filling in the huge potholes armed with a heavy duty concrete garden roller, shovels, rakes and brushes.

David Horn, 77, who lives on the affected Crawshaw Gardens, said: 'We decided enough is enough.

'There has been much discussion with Leeds City Council over the years and although it is an unadopted road, we feel they could help us out.

'There are 14 houses here and we all pay council tax. It seems ridiculous that we have to pay for our own road repairs too.

'Over the years we have repaired numerous holes several times.'

The residents claim the road had 100 potholes and some were 6ft wide.

They have been in discussions with the council for a year to get the potholes fixed. 

Local MP Stuart Andrew has been out to visit the road but informed the men that there was little the council could do as it is 'unadopted' - which means the council does not own the road and is not liable for maintenance.

Retired teacher Chris McNamara, 64, who filled in the holes, said: 'We are not necessarily picking a fight with the council, but most people here are elderly, some in their 80s or 90s.

'We are mending the road. We all pay our council tax.' 

Glynn Crampton, 70, who has been responsible for sealing the holes, added: 'They could be dangerous which is why we decided to fill them in ourselves.' 

The group is due to meet with Councillor Richard Lewis to see if any help is available. 

A Leeds City Council spokesman said it was 'unadopted' but was unable to comment further.

Councils are not liable to repair damaged roads which are unadopted or privately owned.
