The historic national census is to move online to save the taxpayer 
almost £400 million, national statistics chiefs said yesterday.

The population count, first carried out more than 200 years ago, will 
drop the requirement that every home and individual in the country must 
fill in a paper form detailing their lives.

Instead the headcount 
will be carried out over the internet, with paper forms available only 
to those unwilling to use computers or smartphones to make their return.

When
 the next census is run in 2021, the Office for National Statistics 
expects to hire an army of enumerators equipped with iPads or similar 
devices to help the elderly and others unsure of how to use the internet
 to complete their questionnaires.

Census-takers will also turn to 
tax and NHS records to try to fill in any gaps left by the online census
 and to try to keep population estimates up to date during the 10-year 
gap between each full-scale census.

National Statistician Jil 
Matheson said yesterday that Parliament will need to pass new 
legislation to allow the use of publicly-held data for the census.

She 
said: ‘I recognise that this legislation, desirable as it is for 
statistics and their users, requires understanding and support form an 
informed general public, and appropriate safeguards to protect personal 
privacy.’

The first national census was taken in 1801, propelled by 
official fears of the risks of a population explosion, and the count has
 been repeated every decade since, except in 1941.

Questions over its
 future were raised after 2001, when a poorly-organised census missed a 
million people, but the 2011 exercise managed to draw returns from 94 
per cent of the population. Its successes included detecting half a 
million Eastern European immigrants who moved to Britain after 2004 but 
who had escaped the notice of other attempts to estimate the population.

Cabinet
 Office Minister Francis Maude has been anxious to win savings by 
reforming the census.

The 2011 census cost £500 million, but repeating 
the paper exercise in 2021 would cost an estimated £1 billion.

ONS officials indicated yesterday that they believe an on-line census can be brought in for £625 million.

Miss
 Matheson said: ‘The general public is ready to move to a fully on-line 
census, as long as there is appropriate help and support for those who 
cannot or will not go on-line.’

She said using administrative data alone
 - using information from public databases like birth and death 
registers, the electoral roll, NHS registers, school and university 
lists, and benefit and tax records - had a high risk of failure.

Such 
information is mainly used to count the population in European countries
 which have population registers and identity card schemes.

The ONS 
already use child benefit statistics and birth and death registers to 
count population, Miss Matheson said. However, public records could not 
be used to build up a reliable picture of, for example, the ethnicity of
 the population.

The on-line census and public information will be 
backed by a survey of four per cent of the population intended to 
double-check the findings. For those chosen, taking part in the survey 
will be compulsory.
