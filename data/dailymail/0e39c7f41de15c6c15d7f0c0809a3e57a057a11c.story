While many Southampton fans are concerned about the future of their club, manager Ronald Koeman is seemingly unfazed.

Dejan Lovren was the latest player to leave the south coast side on Sunday, following Rickie Lambert and Adam Lallana to Liverpool. 

Koeman has also seen Luke Shaw leave for Manchester United and looks set to lose Calum Chambers to Arsenal.

Despite that though, Koeman took to Twitter to post a picture of Southampton's training ground with the message: 'Ready for #Training!'.

Although, somewhat worryingly for Saints fans, Koeman seems to not only be lacking in players - but also equipment.

While well stocked on cones, Koeman seems to have little else as Southampton gear up for their opening Premier League fixture against Liverpool at Anfield on August 17.

Many are predicting the Saints will struggle this season after their mass exodus, but maybe Koeman's undiminished enthusiasm is a sign he has an ace or two up his sleeve.
