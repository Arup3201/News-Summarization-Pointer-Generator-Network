Leicester have launched a bid to take Manchester United prospect Tom Lawrence on loan.

The 20-year-old was given his full league debut at the end of last season by Ryan Giggs when he started alongside James Wilson against Hull City.

The young Wales U21 international was expected to be part of Louis Van Gaal’s plans but if Leicester can guarantee him more games, a loan may prove of greater benefit with United.
