Sydney Siege survivor Marcia Mikhael has revealed she contemplated suicide after she was the victim of an online hate campaign, where people accused her of cashing in on her terrifying ordeal.

Ms Mikhael was one of 18 people who were held hostage on December 15 by gunman Man Haron Monis for almost 17 hours inside the Lindt cafe at Martin Place in Sydney's CBD.

She and other victims of the siege were reportedly paid to tell their stories on rival networks Channel Seven and Channel Nine in January.

Ms Mikhael told the Blacktown Sun was bullied online after her lawyer told media she wanted a six-figure sum to tell her story in a television appearance.

'I went from being a victim and a hero to a villain, police basher,' the mother-of-three said.

'When all the bullying started I actually thought about killing myself.

'Every single one of the hostages received a payout from either Channel Seven or Nine. So why am I the only greedy monster?'

Ms Mikhael said she had donated an unspecified amount of money from her television appearance and magazine interview to mental health service Lifeline. 

The Westpac project manager also revealed she had flashbacks and nightmares about the siege.

Ms Mikhael said she had been slammed on social media, accused of profiting out of her terrifying experience

She said she did not trust people anymore and was 'terrified' to go out.

The 43-year-old added she had undergone two surgeries on each leg to remove more than 200 pieces of shrapnel.

One of her comments during her interview on Channel Seven, which drew the most controversy, was how she thought the army could have handled it better than the NSW police who she said could have been more proactive in their approach.

Ms Mikhael told the Blacktown Sun those comments had been taken out of context, adding she had thanked the police for saving her early on in the interview.

The former bodybuilder believes her road to recovery will be a long one but she was forcing herself back into her old routine.

In January during her Channel Seven appearance, Ms Mikhael told reporter Mel Doyle how she shouted out to officers to let them know where she was on the floor, next to Katrina Dawson.

When Monis fired the deadly shot to the back of Tori Johnson's head, Ms Mikhael and Ms Dawson were side-by-side, and also in the firing line.

'As soon as the second shot took place, and she looked at me, and then she puts her hands on her face and she puts her face down, like to protect her face. 

'And I kind of go into a foetal position, you know, and my legs get hit. Both legs were in agony.' 

Ms Dawson and Mr Johnson were two of three people killed during the siege.

Monis was the third person who died when police stormed the building after hearing gunshots.
