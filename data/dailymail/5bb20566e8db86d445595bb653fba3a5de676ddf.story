'They should have cut me off!': Mark Johnston says the Dowtown Grand in Las Vegas took advantage of his drunken stupor when they gave him a $500,000 loan

A California man who lost $500,000 during a Las Vegas trip over the Super Bowl weekend is suing the casino for his losses because he was blackout drunk.

Retiree Mark Johnston is suing the brand new Downtown Grand for loaning him the money and allowing him to play while he was inebriated.

Nevada law bars casinos from allowing visibly drunk patrons to gamble and from serving them comped drinks.

'I feel like they picked my pockets,'
 Johnston told MyNews3. 'I feel like they took a drunk guy...like a 
drunk guy walking down the street, and you reach in his pockets and grab
 all his money.'

According to Johnston's complaint, he drank at the airport and on the way to the hotel.

He and his friends at at a restaurant, then things get fuzzy for Johnston.

'After that, I don't remember anything,' he said.

But memory or no, Johnston appears to have had quite the time in Sin City.

So much so that he took out a loan with the hotel for $500,000. And promptly lost it all.

And therein lies their claim, said Johnston's attorney Sean Lyttle.

'You certainly arent't to issue half a million dollars in markers to someone who's intoxicated,' he said.

The state Gaming Control Board is investigating.

The
 Downton Grand does not comment on pending litigation but Lyttle says 
the Grand, which opened late last year, is countersuing Johnston for 
trying to shirk his gambling debts.

Johnston says this all boils down to responsibility and, not surprisingly, he blamed the casino.

'They
 should have cut me off,' he said. 'The bottom line is the casinos are 
supposed to not gamble to you and not overserve you in alcohol. That's 
gaming regulation.'

Just opened: The Downtown Grand had only been open for a couple of months when Johnston visited there from California in February. The casino is counter-suing Johnston for shirking his gambling debt
