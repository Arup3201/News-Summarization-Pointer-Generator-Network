HeloÌsa Pinheiro is the 'Girl From Ipanema', a Rio native whose daily strolls past the Veloso Bar in 1962 inspired a global hit and put Brazil on the map.

'Tall and tanned and young and lovely' Heloise, known as Helo, caught the eye of composer Antonio Carlos Jobim and Portuguese poet Vinicius de Moraes who together penned one of the world's most recorded songs.

Now new pictures have revealed that the girl from Ipanema was still making the boys go 'aaaah' as she passed, well in to her sixties.

In this shoot from 2006, Helo, age 63, returned to the beach that made her famous to show off  a figure that many women half her age would kill for.

The original song was written in 1962 with English lyrics written later by Norman Gimbel and the bossa nova song became a worldwide hit after being performed in by Astrud Gilberto, along with Jo„o Gilberto and Stan Getz, from the 1963 album Getz/Gilberto.

And though the writers and their estates have made millions in royalties from the song, Helo never made a penny from it.

In fact when she tried to open a clothing boutique with the name 'The Girl from Ipanema' she was sued by the heirs to co-writers Antonio Carlos Jobim and Vinicius de Moraes, but after much legal wrangling was able to keep the name of her shop.

Helo is a celebrity in Rio, and Brazil, regularly appearing at events and on TV shows. She became a Brazilian Playboy Playmate in 1987 and once again in 2003, when she did a pictorial along with her daughter.

Hero still claims to love the song and told the Guardian: 'It's eternal. Whenever I listen, I remember my past, my younger days. Ipanema in 1962 was a great place. You never saw aggression. Everyone wanted to fall in love. It was the spirit of bossa nova – tranquil and romantic Today, you don't see composers in the bars and restaurants. There isn't the same inspiration.'
