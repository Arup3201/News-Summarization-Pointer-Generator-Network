Carmen Dell'Orefice, dubbed the world's oldest working supermodel, graces the cover of New You's upcoming issue, and she looks as breathtaking as ever.

The 83-year-old New York-born beauty - who first covered Vogue when she was 15 and has enjoyed an illustrious career ever since - spoke frankly about everything from maintaining her model figure through seven decades in the industry, to 'preparing' for death, and still enjoying sex in her 80s.

'Of course I still have a sex life, why would I give that up?' she insists. 'Do I love to breathe? If you have a Rolls Royce and it is up on wheels, you go in with the key and every now and then turn on the motor to make sure the motor is running. So when you want to drive the car, it is all oiled and ready.'

Perfect poise: Carmen Dell'Orefice, dubbed the world's oldest working supermodel, graces the cover of New You's upcoming issue, and the 83-year-old looks as breathtaking as ever

Carmen, who was born in New York to parents of Italian and Hungarian descent, has been married three times and engaged once more but doesn't mention any names in reference to her current love life.

In a 2011 interview with The Telegraph, however, she said: 'There's always a boyfriend. Whatever else I have to give up on, I won't give up on love.'

Asked by New You how Carmen keeps her proverbial Rolls Royce 'oiled', the stunning model responds: 'I know how to pleasure myself. 

'I can go for a low romantic love, and that’s fine but I am conditioned to the whole meal.' 

On sex: 'If you have a Rolls Royce... you go in with the key and every now and then turn on the motor to make sure the motor is running. So when you want to drive the car, it is all oiled and ready,' she says

Speaking about why so many people 'give up' on sex later on in life, Carmen states: 'Because they never entered sex from the right doorway.

'We are told by our parents, "don’t do that" or "that’s bad" and then there is religion and the doctors who say "oh you are over sex."

'No - you are just under-satisfied. It should be like breathing - so natural.'

Carmen also spoke to the publication about maintaining her model figure over the 70 years she has been working.

'I eat to my appetite and don’t count calories,' she says.

'I want to enjoy food passionately. I could have gotten into trouble with food in my lifetime because I love to eat but I was given a free pass because I metabolize food well.'

She does open up about her one guilty pleasure, however, admitting: 'I’ve had my issues with ice cream when I was younger. Friends will open my freezer today and say, “My God, who eats all this ice-cream?”

'It stays frozen just in case. That is my money in the bank. It gives me a feeling of security. One would think clothes would do it for me - but no, it’s ice cream.'

As for the healthier end of the food spectrum, Carmen has her tricks.

'If you don’t like watery spinach learn to braise it yourself or eat it raw,' she advises. 'That is the creativity of living.'

Long career: Carmen, pictured in 1955 at the age of 23 in the aisle of an airplane, says, 'when I die, it's going to be my way'

On a more serious note, Carmen spoke to the publication about 'preparing for death', having just lost two friends which whom she enjoyed '60 or 70-year-long' friendships - one being model agent Eileen Ford.

'[They] prepared me for dying because they knew how to live their lives,' she says.

'Most people don’t know how to live their life so they don’t know how to die. They are startled or confused by it but it is part of living. That’s why I always say, when I die it’s going to be my way.'

Asked her views on the models of today, Carmen describes them as 'essentially bodies-for-hire'.

She elaborated, saying: 'Short of having to go to bed with everyone, it is tough work.

'The smartest, with a good education and some good moral support from family and mentors, will not fall into booby-traps.

'They will save their money and use it and the experience as stepping stones to a more permanent career. I’m just an outsider observing but this is my impression.'
