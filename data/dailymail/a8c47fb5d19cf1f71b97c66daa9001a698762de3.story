Canadian Bank of England Governor Mark Carney speaks with the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, during last year's event

For the Bank of England’s annual summer party, Governor Mark Carney was convinced the event needed to be a little bit more inclusive.

But for many staff the Canadian’s decision to tamper with tradition just wasn’t, well, cricket.

The Bank’s first foreign chief has lined up a rounders match to replace cricket because he believes the age-old summer game to be too exclusive.

Other activities at the event in Roehampton, South West London, tomorrow include five-a-side football, tennis, a three-legged race, an egg-and-spoon race, tug-of-war and welly throwing.

Mr Carney stopped short of introducing ice-hockey, the sport he played when he was at Harvard in the 1980s and Oxford in the 1990s.

The decision to ditch cricket is likely to raise eyebrows among staff past and present including former governor and keen cricketer Lord King, who took part in the match up to his retirement last summer.

David Buik, a veteran City commentator who has played at the Bank’s ground, said the decision to scrap cricket was outrageous. He said: ‘It is sacrilege. It is one of the most wonderful grounds you could ever wish to play on and for the game to be denied because of exclusivity is awful. Cricket is one of our national games.’

The event usually pits 11 members of staff against a governor’s team.

Former England captain Andrew Strauss played in last year’s match, as did Chief Secretary to the Treasury Danny Alexander.

Mr Carney attended last year’s event, a day before taking over on an £874,000-a-year pay package.

Lord King, who is also a tennis fan and a regular at Wimbledon, is president of the Chance to Shine charity which aims to boost participation in sport.

But Mr Carney is understood to have regarded a match involving 22 men as too exclusive and wanted to include more women.

He is a keen sportsman and was an ice hockey goalkeeper in his youth.

He is a fan of Premier League side Everton, and will no doubt be keeping an eye on Centre Court today where fellow Canadian Eugenie Bouchard is bidding to win Wimbledon.

The Bank denied Mr Carney ‘banned’ cricket and insisted that staff were asked what events they would like to take place. A spokesman said: ‘The arrangements for the day were in the hands of staff. They chose a number of sports such as rounders, football and tug-of-war among others.’
