A bogus roofer ripped off an elderly customer just three years after being let off by a judge for an identical scam.

Danny Sherwood flicked a defiant V-sign as he walked free from court in 2011 despite admitting overcharging an 86-year-old woman £700 for basic repairs to her roof.

This week he was back in court for overcharging a 73-year-old woman £2,150 for £630 work he carried out to her house.

Sherwood comes from a family of 
rogue traders in Bournemouth, Dorset - his brother and father have also both been convicted of ripping off elderly customers.

Danny Sherwood sticks two fingers up at the law after evading jail for conning an elderly woman out of £700 - only to commit a bigger crime just three years on

In his latest scam Sherwood convinced the pensioner that her chimney was unsafe and needed removing although there was not anything wrong with it.

The 30-year-old rogue trader then marched the woman to the cashpoint so she could withdraw £250 to pay him.

Sherwood lied to his victim about his home address and failed to provide a receipt and written guarantee for the work to her roof.

Sherwood comes from a family of rogue traders in Bournemouth, Dorset.  His older brother Kevin (left) was convicted of conning an 85-year-old man out of £1,300 for a job he said would cost £50. In January last year their father, also called Kevin, (right)  was sentenced to 12 months in prison for ripping off two elderly couples

He was only caught when she complained to her Trading Standards department once the work had been carried out in September 2012.

Sherwood was found guilty of seven counts of fraud at Bournemouth Crown Court and will be sentenced next month.

In 2011 he was spared jail after admitting carrying out £780 worth of work to a house having promised its owner he would repair a broken roof tile ‘for a fiver’.

In the same year his older brother Kevin was convicted of conning an 85-year-old man out of £1,300 for a job he said would cost £50.

He had tried to charge another £3,700 on top of the £1,300 for the straightforward repairs to roof tiles.

Kevin Sherwood was given a nine months suspended prison sentence, 200 hours community service and told to pay £2,500 costs and £2,496 compensation to his victim.

In January last year their father, also called Kevin, was sentenced to 12 months in prison for ripping off two elderly couples to the sum of £37,000.

He charged one couple £25,000 after convincing them their whole roof needed replacing, then took £12,000 from another couple for unnecessary work to their bungalow.

He was also handed an ASBO banning him from taking advantage of pensioners.

James
 Norman, the regulatory team manager at Poole council which prosecuted 
Sherwood, said: 'This is a case of an elderly vulnerable woman being 
exploited by a trader.

'We
 are delighted with this verdict which sends a clear message to those 
people who seek to defraud members of our community that Trading 
Standards will use all means at their disposal to bring these traders to
 justice.'

Stuart Brown, from Trading Standards added: 'The south west has a higher than average proportion of elderly and vulnerable residents and therefore we are a particular target for rogue companies.

'Tackling doorstep crime is our number one priority for 2014.

'We will extend every effort to catch those rogue traders who bring misery to the doorstep of elderly and vulnerable residents trying to enjoy their retirement in peace.'
