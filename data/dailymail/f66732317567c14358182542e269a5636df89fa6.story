Racism in English football is overt - and highlighted by the struggles of Chelsea youth coach Eddie Newton to secure a managerial job, FIFA's anti-discrimination chief has claimed.

Jeffrey Webb, who is also a FIFA vice-president and head of the confederation covering the Caribbean, North and central America, insists the problem is not behind the scenes and is 'right in front of your face', and encouraged English football to adopt the Rooney rule used in NFL.

Webb told the Leaders in Sport conference in London: 'I don't know how it could be hidden. You have 92 clubs, you have two coaches of colour.

'How many board members or executives are in various club positions or at the FA, in UEFA? So, it's not hidden.'

Webb also said the experience of former Chelsea assistant manager Newton had hammered home to him the depth of the problem.

Newton was assistant manager under Roberto di Matteo when Chelsea won the Champions League in 2012, but Webb said he is now struggling even to get an interview as a manager.

Newton, also former assistant manager at West Brom, is still employed by Chelsea as a technical coach on their youth development programme.

'I hosted a dinner a few months ago, last time I was here. I met a young guy coaching at Chelsea, who was assistant coach and won a Champions League final, doing well.

'He can't even get an interview, Eddie Newton. I'm not talking about getting a job, getting an interview. That's not hidden. That's right in front of your face.'

Webb said the time had come for English football to embrace affirmative action such as the NFL's Rooney rule, which obliges clubs to include an ethnic minority candidate on shortlists for all coaching positions.

Webb added: 'In this day and time, in this era, in this century, should we really be having to mandate opportunities for qualified individuals? Sadly, the answer is yes.'

PFA chief executive Gordon Taylor said last week the lack of black coaches underlined 'hidden' racism within the game.

Webb said American owners of English clubs could help push through change.

He said: 'It's hidden from a discussion standpoint. No-one wants to deal with it. No-one wants to deal with it from a commercial standpoint.

'It has to come within. It has to come from the clubs. It has to start with clubs. It has to start with ownership.

'How many American owners do we have from English Premier League clubs in the UK?

'So, why have certain standards here and then, of course, in the US, in the NFL leagues, where you live, where you conduct business, you live by different standards? Why?

'If it's good there, why wouldn't it be good here?'

Webb added that there was a 'huge challenge' with the next World Cup taking place in Russia, which has been the scene for numerous incidents of racism in football. UEFA last week ordered CSKA Moscow to play three European matches behind closed doors after racist incidents involving fans.

The PFA and Kick It Out have both pressed for the Rooney rule to be introduced in English football, but the authorities have so far resisted the move.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho said there was 'no racism in football' when asked for his view of the Rooney rule last week.
