Anna Kendrick has admitted that she 'honest to god' hasn't been 'hit on' since 2009.

The 28-year-old Twilight star, singer and all-round funny-girl, says the last time she recalls being hit on was around the time she played her Oscar-nominated role opposite George Clooney in Up in the Air, when she was 23.

A modest Miss Kendrick, who covers ELLE's July issue, also downplays her natural good looks, telling the magazine: 'I’m lucky that I’ve never had a crisis about whether the only reason I’m successful is because I’m crazy hot.'

Miss Kendrick ended her four-year relationship with director and producer Edgar Wright last year, and hasn't publicly dated anyone since.

The star also opens up about emerging as a woman late in her teens.

'When I was a teenager, I was an ultra-late bloomer, and my mom would say it was a blessing, because it means you never have to wonder if guys are only interested in you because you’ve got boobs,' she tells the publication.

'I would have been thrilled if guys were interested in me because of my boobs!'

Good advice: She also opened up about being an 'ultra-late bloomer' in her teens - which her mother told her was, in fact, 'a blessing'

The energetic star also discusses growing up in Portland, Maine, and the amicable divorce of her parents - an accountant, Janice, and a teacher, William - when she was 15.

'I hate when people think you're broken because your parents are divorced,' she remarks.

'And I really reject the idea of staying together for the kids. If they're growing up in a house that's not healthy, it's better to know that's not the model of what marriage should be.'

In accordance with the publication's upcoming Social Issue, Miss Kendrick was given control of the ELLE Twitter handle today - which shouldn't be too much of a problem for the actress, who has carved out quite the name for herself with her own 2.5million-strong Twitter following - touting herself as: 'Pale, awkward and very, very small'.

'I would have been thrilled if guys were interested in me because of my boobs!

'I'm taking over the @ELLEmagazine twitter today. Which is a thing. Tune in to watch me slowly lose my mind in public!' she tweeted this morning.

One tweet saw the flame-haired actress make a lighthearted jibe at the actress who took last month's cover spot: 'If Angelina Jolie was last month's cover girl does that mean we have to fight to the death now? Is that how that works?'

Shortly therefore, another staffer with access to the ELLE Twitter handle tweeted the following: 'New technology lets you to wear your Spanx out in public!. And no, we're not implying anything about @AnnaKendrick47'

To which Miss Kendrick hastily responded: 'What the hell was that last tweet Elle? That's how we're gonna play it?? It's ON!'

Miss Kendrick is currently juggling a whopping seven acting and singing projects, including the highly-anticipated Pitch Perfect squeal, in which she plays a reclusive college freshman who joins an all-girl Capella group called The Barden Bellas.

Her hit song 'Cups', which she recorded for the wildly popular original Pitch Perfect soundtrack, spent 44 weeks on Billboard's Hot 100 in 2013.

Last month, Miss Kendrick hosted her first Saturday Night Live show, along with fellow jokester Seth Rogan. The July issue hits newsstands on June 24.
