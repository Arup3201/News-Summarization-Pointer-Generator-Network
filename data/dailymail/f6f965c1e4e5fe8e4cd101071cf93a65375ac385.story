Blackpool agreed deals to sign three players on Monday to take the number of registered players at the club up to eleven.

Midfielders Jacob Mellis and Tomasz Cywka and defender Peter Clarke will join on free transfers, subject to the players signings a medical, and they have signed one year contracts with the option to extend the deals for a further 12 months.

Both Mellis and Cywka left Barnsley at the end of last season upon the expiry of their contracts while Clarke was released by Huddersfield, having previously played for the Tangerines from 2004 until 2006.

New start: Jacob Mellis, a Chelsea academy graduate, has joined Blackpool on a free transfer

Back again: Peter Clarke has returned to Bloomfield Road where he played between 2004 and 2006

Blackpool's pre-season preparations remain strewn in chaos with the Championship side still to sign a goalkeeper and Jose Riga's squad remains woefully understocked ahead of their first league match of the season at Nottingham Forest on August 9.

Goalkeeper Ben Alnwick had been on trial and set to sign but instead opted to join Peterborough.

Mellis, a Chelsea academy graduate, had been training with the club for some time and played as a trialist in the club's only pre-season friendly against Penrith. A training camp in Spain was cancelled due to a lack of players on Blackpool's books.

In March 2012, Mellis was sacked by Chelsea after setting off a smoke bomb in the reserve team dressing room, causing a full-scale evacuation at the club's training ground. One month later, he also received a caution for common assault after a row with his girlfriend at his Surrey apartment.

The rebuilding job at Blackpool is expected to continue apace this week. It is understood that Costa Rica's World Cup midfielder Jose Miguel Cubero will fly in for a medical with Blackpool tomorrow.

Manager Jose Riga, whose relationship with spendthrift chairman Karl Oyston remains thorny, is also considering a move for Nathan Delfouneso, who has been released by Aston Villa.
