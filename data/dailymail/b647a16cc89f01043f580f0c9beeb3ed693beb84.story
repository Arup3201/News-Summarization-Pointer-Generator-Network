Resigned: Luke March has quit as the Compliance Officer at Ipsa after his controversial comments over keeping expenses investigations secret

The chief of the Commons expenses watchdog has quit just over a week after he was roundly criticised for refusing to name MPs being investigated for dubious claims.

Luke March has resigned as the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority's (Ipsa) compliance officer with immediate effect.

The move followed an interview last week in which Mr March argued that details of his probes should remain secret.

He said it would be 'unfair' to identify MPs before allegations were proved, and suggested there should be no publicity at all if they were cleared.

Mr March appeared to be contradicting transparency guidelines set by Ipsa, which indicate that politicians should be identified when a formal probe is launched, and cases should be heard in public where possible.

A statement on the body's website revealed that Mr March, who had only been in the post two months, tendered his resignation last Wednesday.

In a letter to chairman Sir Ian Kennedy, he wrote: 'As I explained during our conversation, after much thought and with a good deal of regret, I have come to the conclusion that the role of Compliance Officer for Ipsa is not the right role for me.

'On that basis, I have decided that the sensible thing for me to do is to resign the post.'

Sir Ian replied: 'Thank you for your letter of July 27 and for notice of your resignation from the post of Compliance Officer.

The new politics: Ipsa was set up in the wake of the expenses scandal that rocked Parliament

'I accept, with regret, and understand your conclusion that the role is not the right one for you. I know you did not reach this conclusion lightly or hastily.'

Martyn Taylor, previously Ipsa's head of governance, has now become its third compliance officer in little more than a year.

He will fill in for six months until a permanent successor can be found.

Ex-RAF officer Alan Lockwood was given the post on an interim basis when Ipsa took charge of Commons expenses after the General Election.

Mr March was part-way through probes into a number of MPs' claims.Liberal Democrat Bob Russell is the only named subject so far.

He disclosed the fact himself in May, and the case was later dropped.

Matthew Elliott, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said: 'After the MPs' expenses scandal one of the crucial principles behind the new system was transparency.

'Taxpayers have a right to know if an MP is being investigated, equally it should be made public if the probe amounts to nothing, or if the error was Ipsa's.

'Public trust in Parliament and the expenses system is still fragile and it would be unacceptable for allegations of dubious claims to be swept under the carpet, or for investigations to be conducted in secret.'
