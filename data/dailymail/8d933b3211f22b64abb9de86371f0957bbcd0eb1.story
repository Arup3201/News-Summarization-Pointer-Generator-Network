Journalist Nils Horner was shot dead while he was talking to a translator on a street in an affluent area of the Afghanistan capital

An extremist Taliban splinter group has claimed responsibility for killing a Swedish-British journalist in Kabul saying he was killed he was a spy for Britain's MI-6 agency.

Nils Horner had worked for Swedish Radio SR since 2001 as a foreign correspondent mostly in Asia and the Middle East, including Afghanistan and Baghdad.

The 51-year-old was killed by a shot in the head as he was reporting on Afghanistan's election on a street in Kabul on Tuesday.

It was a rare assassination of a foreigner in the capital and raised fears of increased violence ahead of the April 5 presidential election.

The Feday-e-Mahaz says in a statement posted Wednesday on its website that it targeted Horner because he was a spy and not a journalist.

The group was created by loyalists of slain Taliban commander Mullah Dadullah.

The group broke with the Taliban following the announcement of talks with the United States.

A 
guard at a restaurant across the street from where the attack happened 
said two young men approached the journalist as he was talking to his 
translator at about 11 a.m. on the side of the road

The
 guard, Mohammad Zubair, said one of the men pulled out a pistol and 
shot Horner in the head, causing him to collapse in a pool of blood.

He 
said there was a single shot and the bullet then hit a nearby car, which
 was left with a bullet hole.

The witness said he and other guards called to the police at a nearby checkpoint and they cordoned off the area.

The 
attack came two months after the Islamic militant movement staged
 a suicide bombing and shooting assault against a Lebanese restaurant 
that killed 13 foreigners and eight Afghans in the same area.

Suicide
 bombings and other attacks are frequent in Kabul and elsewhere in 
Afghanistan as insurgents fight to undermine confidence in the 
Western-backed government.

But assassinations of journalists and other foreigners in the capital are relatively rare.

Not
 including Horner, at least 29 journalists have been killed in 
Afghanistan since 1992, most of them after the 2001 U.S.-led ouster of 
the Taliban, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect 
Journalists.

Sayed Gul 
Agha Hashimi, the head of the Kabul Criminal Investigation Department, 
said police were questioning the journalist's driver and translator as 
part of the investigation.

Hashimi said the journalist died while being treated at the hospital.

Swedish Embassy counselor Christian Nilsson said the body had been transported to the morgue.

Anne Lagercrantz, head of news at Swedish Radio, said the newsroom was in deep shock.

She said Horner spoke to the desk in Stockholm early on Tuesday and they agreed that he would go out and do interviews ahead of the April 5 presidential election.

When people in the newsroom saw reports that a foreign journalist had been shot in Kabul, they tried to contact Horner by email but got no response.

They then called his mobile phone, and a doctor answered saying Horner had been shot and killed, Lagercrantz said.

Swedish Radio chief executive Cilla Benko said two men approached Horner and shot him in the back of his head.

Benko said Horner was very safety conscious but was prepared to take risks.

'This was his life,' Benko said. 'He didn't want to do anything else.'

Swedish Radio officials said there were no known threats to Horner.

The attack came as security in the capital was tight amid fears of violence in connection with the funeral of Afghanistan's powerful Vice President Mohammed Qasim Fahim.
