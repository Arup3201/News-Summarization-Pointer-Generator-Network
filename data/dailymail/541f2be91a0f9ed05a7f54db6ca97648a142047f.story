Britain's most-dedicated lifeboat volunteer finally retires today after being on call 24 hours a day for 57 years.

David James, 74, began volunteering with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution in Minehead, Somerset, as a schoolboy in 1955.

He has been on stand-by around the clock ever since, sleeping with a pager by his bed and even remaining on call every Christmas Day.

Finally time to relax: Britain's most dedicated lifeboat volunteer David James, who is retiring after 57 years on call, sits on the beach at Minehead, Somerset, where he launched his career in 1955

David, who is a cabinet maker by 
trade, has been involved in around 1,000 call-outs over the years, but 
insists it is all part of living by the sea.

He said: 'I don't think what I've done is remarkable, when you live by the sea it is just in your blood.

'It's
been so much fun and a complete pleasure. I could still carry on if I 
really wanted. My colleagues don't want me to leave.

'It has taken a large chunk of my life, but I think it's time to stop. It's like the end of an era.'

David
first began volunteering with the RNLI in 1955 at the age of 17 when he
offered to help launch boats at the station which was just yards from 
his home.

After 15 years, he joined the crew full-time as a helmsman in 1970 and served 18 years before returning to life as a volunteer.

Emergency response: A crew out on the water in the mid 1990s. A spokesman for the RNLI said the Minehead station had launched an average of 22 rescues a year since electronic records began in 1970

During his career at sea, he was 
called out on Christmas Day in the 1980s to rescue a stricken Greek 
crewman anchored off the coast of Watchet, Somerset.

They recovered the seaman and put him on a stretcher before lowering him in rough seas onto a lifeboat waiting below.

However, getting him back to land proved a challenge.

David,
who officially retires tomorrow, said: 'We took a doctor, who was also a
crew member, out to the ship and it turned out the sick man had renal 
failure.

'We had to get him 
ashore fast, but when we got back to Watchet the tide was out and we had
to run the boat aground to haul him across some deep mud.'

It was reported that the mud came up to the crew's thighs. 'It was getting dark as we came back in and we were singing carols', David added.

'The ambulance crew came down the harbour steps to help, and meanwhile the boat had drifted away.

'The seaman was taken off and then we had to retrieve the boat.'

How times have changed: Volunteers launch a rescue rowing boat using logs in the 1930s

Up against it: Around 22 people are rescued per day by the RNLI, pictured here in the 1930s, costing a staggering £385,000 to run, but the charity does not receive any state funding

A number of years later the father-of-three was involved in a rescue where he climbed 50ft up the crumbling Culver Cliff, in the Isle of Wight, to reach a man who had got stuck.

He received a prestigious award and a framed letter of thanks from the Lifeboat Operations Manager for the rescue, which saw him climb the cliff three times.

David said: 'When I got to him he was petrified and wouldn't move so I climbed back down and got the anchor rope and tied it around him and around the rock and he said: 'will it be ok?'

'I said: "You've got two chances. You will be ok." I lowered him down and then his radio was up on a ledge and I went up and got that as well.

'Lifeboat Magazine called it "music while you work'. I was surprised to get the award.'

In 1988 David became a deputy launching authority - making him one of five people authorised to order the boat to sea - and has worked in that position ever since.

Now David, who still lives in Minehead, plans to enjoy his retirement by taking a trip around the country in a caravan with his wife Pam.

He added: 'Volunteering for the RNLI just becomes a way of life, I'm not sure how I'll spend the free time now, but I definitely want to get a caravan and tour bits of the country I've missed over the year.'

A spokesman for the RNLI said that 
Minehead Station had launched an average of 22 rescues a year since 
electronic records began in 1970.

Across the UK, around 22 people are rescued per day by the RNLI, costing a staggering £385,000 to run.

The charity does not receive any state funding and is entirely dependant on donations.

A spokesman for the RNLI was unable to confirm whether David is the longest-serving volunteer and said he was among 'a handful' of members who have served a number of decades.
