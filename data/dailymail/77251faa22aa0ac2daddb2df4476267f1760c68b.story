A black woman is demanding an apology from NHS chiefs after she was sent a letter saying her password was set as 'charcoal shade' for a hospital website.

Leanda Probert, 31, from Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, was horrified when she discovered the 'highly offensive' password in a letter asking her to book an online appointment with a pain management clinic.

The mother-of-one, who suffers from crippling condition fibromyalgia, said she thought NHS North Somerset was 'having a laugh' and 'taking the mick' when she opened the letter.

Ms Probert was sent the 'highly offensive' password 'charcoal shade' in a letter requesting she make an appointment with a pain management clinic via an NHS website

She said: 'I was very taken aback and highly offended.

'I understand these passwords are computer generated, but I just think certain words should not be included because they could be offensive to some people.

'I am a black woman and I think those two words "charcoal shade" coupled together is just too much and I found it very very offensive.

'The letter must have been put in an envelope by someone - why did they not proof read it and realise it could be offensive?'

Ms Probert, who lives with her partner 
Damien Field, 29, and daughter Gabriella, two, said the NHS needs to 
address its procedures.

She said: 'I don't think it was intentional racial abuse and I really do not think that this has been done maliciously.

'But I do think they need to change their policies and procedures to make sure some words simply do not appear in passwords.

Fibromyalgia is a long-term condition which causes pain all over the body and extreme tiredness.

People with fibromyalgia may also have:

It is estimated that fibromyalgia affects nearly 1 in 20 people worldwide.

Anyone can develop fibromyalgia, although it affects more women than men.

'This password they gave me was thoughtless and offensive and despite complaining I am yet to receive an apology.'

Ms Probert was diagnosed with fibromyalgia two years ago after more than a decade of suffering with the condition which causes widespread pain and extreme tiredness - but has no known cause or cure.

She said: 'I have trouble getting up and down on the sofa, insomnia, nausea, IBS and forgetfulness.

'Sometimes my partner has to give me a list of things to do because my memory is awful.'

A spokesman for NHS North Somerset apologised for the blunder.

He said: 'North Somerset CCG would like to apologise for any offence that the password contained within the letter may have caused.

'The password was generated automatically by the central choose and book system with the words themselves randomly selected by an electronic database.'
