A 20-year-old woman who suffered a heart attack during cosmetic surgery on Friday morning had her procedure completed by doctors before she was rushed to hospital.

The woman was undergoing surgery at The Cosmetic Institute at Parramatta in western Sydney yesterday when she fell unconscious and went into cardiac arrest, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.

The woman was stabilised by the anaesthetist as doctors went on to finish up the procedure as part of the clinic's 'strict protocol', managing director David Segal told Daily Mail Australia.

She was then taken to hospital in a serious condition but is now in full recovery. 

A woman, believed to be aged in her 20s, was undergoing a cosmetic procedure at The Cosmetic Institute at Parramatta in western Sydney on Friday morning when she fell unconscious

Yesterday morning paramedics responded at about 10.15am to reports the woman had suffered cardiac arrest, had fallen unconscious and wasn't breathing. 

Staff at the clinic reportedly performed CPR on the woman and used a defibrillator before paramedics arrived.

She was taken to Westmead Hospital in a serious condition but is now stable, a NSW Ambulance spokeswoman said. 

Mr Segal said the new patient was believed to have had a reaction to the anaesthetic.

He would not reveal the procedure the woman was undergoing due to patient confidentiality but said the incident occurred halfway through surgery.

'The onsite anaesthetist was able to revert her back to normal, stabilise her and the surgery was able to be completed,' Mr Segal told Daily Mail Australia.

'It was part of our strict protocol as we did not want to send her to hospital with gaping wounds.'

Managing director of The Cosmetic Institute, David Segal, said the woman was believed to have had a reaction to the anaesthetic

Mr Segal said his staff had following protocol to call an ambulance 'as quickly as possible'. 

'We've performed well over 10,000 procedures, and... with any type of procedure that you undergo, there are always going to be risks associated with it,' he said.

According to the clinic's Facebook page, the woman is in 'good spirits and grateful for the excellent care she received from The TCI team'.

'We have also been informed from Westmead that our patient has made a full recovery,' it reads.

The incident was described as an 'unforeseen event that occurred, unrelated to the surgery itself'.
