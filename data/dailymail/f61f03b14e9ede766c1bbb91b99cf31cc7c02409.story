A 21-year-old woman who was arrested for drunken behavior is facing more serious charges after allegedly headbutting an officer while being booked in a Texas jail.

Kori Hope Jackson could face a $10,000 fine and up to ten years in prison if found guilty of assaulting a public servant.

As the detention officer tried to remove Jackson's jewellery, she is accused of swearing and lashing out at him.

The 21-year-old from Mansfield was being booked into Brazos County Jail on Sunday night over claims of public intoxication.

But as the officers at Brazos County Jail began the usual procedure of booking someone into the cells, Jackson allegedly became abusive.

According to an arrest report seen by the The Eagle, when a jailer began removing her personal items she made a series of threats.

'If you touch me I will you kick you ... I will [expletive] you up,' Jackson reportedly yelled.

She also allegedly shouted: 'It's my ring, take it and I will kill
 you.'

While being restrained Jackson is said to have used the side of her head to strike the officer in the forehead.

She has been charged with felony assault, resisting arrest, public intoxication and disorderly conduct for using profanity.

Jackson was released from the county jail on $14,800 bail.
