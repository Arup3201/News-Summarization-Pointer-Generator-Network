The arrival of the royal baby will inject fresh momentum into the recovering economy as a ‘feel-good factor’ sweeps Britain, an expert said last night.

Howard Archer, a City of London economist, said the impact on growth would be ‘overwhelmingly positive’.

‘The royal birth may provide the economy with a temporary, small positive boost at a time when it seems to be increasingly moving in the right direction,’ he said.

Official figures this week are expected to show the economy grew by around 0.6 per cent between April and June – double the 0.3 per cent expansion in the first three months of the year.

And the birth of the future King seems certain to provide another boost to the national mood.

The most likely economic support will come from sales of royal souvenirs and commemorative merchandise, while bookies benefit from bets on the baby’s name.

The announcement that the Duchess was in labour sent punters to the betting shops, and bookmaker Paddy Power said they took £390,000 in bets in the first three hours after the news broke.
