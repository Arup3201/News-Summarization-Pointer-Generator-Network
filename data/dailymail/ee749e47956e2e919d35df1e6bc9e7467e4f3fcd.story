In the search for success, Tottenham are by no means unique.

Since Joe Lewis appointed his godson Daniel Levy as chairman in 2001, seven permanent managers have passed through White Hart Lane with an eighth now confirmed.

In that time they have tired of George Graham (appointed pre-Levy), Glenn Hoddle, Jacques Santini, Martin Jol, Juande Ramos, Harry Redknapp, Andre Villas-Boas and Tim Sherwood.

Earning his Spurs: Mauricio Pochettino (centre) has signed a five-year deal to become the new Tottenham boss

Atletico Madrid, La Liga champions and beaten Champions League finalists, are on to their 12th manager since the Levy regime began.

Since Real Madrid’s ninth European Cup success, in 2002 at Hampden Park, another nine hugely respected coaches tried and failed to win the 10th.

Carlo Ancelotti, Tottenham’s principal target to replace Sherwood, finally landed No 10.

Barcelona, who have won six La Liga titles and three European Cups since Lewis bought into Spurs, have fired seven managers since Levy arrived. Inter Milan are on their 12th; Bayern Munich are on to their ninth with Pep Guardiola. Stuff happens.

The problem for Tottenham is that no-one can quite work out what it is that they are trying to do.  Levy has gone down every conceivable route and yet the manager is never safe, never secure. It never feels like they have total boardroom support.

Anyone who has ever received a payslip at Tottenham will tell you that this is the most political club in the Premier League.  Every member of staff is jostling for position or the ear of Levy as they grind their way through the season.

Now that Mauricio Pochettino has become the manager on a five-year deal, the ambitions of this great club requires clarification.

We know that fourth-placed finishes are not good enough because Harry Redknapp was fired in May 2012. You could make a case that they have never recovered.

They have the sixth highest wage bill in the Barclays Premier League behind Manchester City, Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal and Liverpool. 

Last season, under the very different approaches of Villas-Boas and Sherwood, they still finished sixth, five points ahead of the deposed champions Manchester United. Sixth is about right.

Although they have some history on their side, they are only the 10th-best supported team in the Barclays Premier League.

You have been warned: Tim Sherwood (left) and Andre Villas-Boas have both been dismissed by Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy (below right) in the past year

Glenn Hoddle (2001-2004)

Jacques Santini (2004)

Martin Jol (2004-2007)

Juande Ramos (2007-2008)

Harry Redknapp (2008-2012)

Andre Villas-Boas (2012-2013)

Tim Sherwood (2013-14)

Mauricio Pochettino (2014-)

*Permanent managers appointed by Levy only - he sacked George Graham in 2001

Tottenham are a big club, just not as big as United and Arsenal, and certainly no bigger than Newcastle, City, Liverpool, Chelsea, Sunderland, Everton and Aston Villa.

All of them had bigger average attendances than Spurs in the Barclays Premier League.

It feels like they are searching for something that doesn’t really exist. History tells us that, but no-one can be sure what Levy wants for this club.

They have tried various approaches over the years and will try again with another foreign coach. Pochettino just happens to be the latest.

This is not an easy job to take, particularly with Tottenham’s record for losing patience with their managers. 

Graham was sacked and replaced with the 
populist appointment of Hoddle before the FA Cup semi-final with Arsenal
 in April 2001. He was sacked in September 2003.

Populist appointment: But Spurs hero Glenn Hoddle's reign only lasted two years

Ruthless streak: Jacques Santini (left) lasted a few months and Martin Jol (right) was sacked during a match

When Jol was manager, Levy delivered a spanking new Porsche 911 to his house when all was well at White Hart Lane. Jol later discovered he was being sacked during a UEFA Cup tie at White Hart Lane against Getafe in 2007.

Ramos, described as ‘a proper manager’ by Jonathan Woodgate when the defender arrived from Middlesbrough, lasted less than a year.

The Spanish coach was the last man to win silverware at Spurs - the Carling Cup against Chelsea at Wembley in 2008 - but that wasn’t enough.

After a poor start the following season he, too, was gone.

Similarly,
 Villas-Boas was fired when he lost the players. He promised that the 
6-0 defeat against Manchester City was a one-off and yet they were 
beaten 5-0 by Liverpool at White Hart Lane a few weeks later.

Juande you're a hero, the next you're gone: Juande Ramos won the Carling Cup in 2008 but was fired months later

The fourth is not with you: Harry Redknapp guided Tottenham into the Champions League for the first time but left the club after he failed to repeat the trick

Tottenham hope Pochettino will be able to unite a dressing room that was splintered under the leadership of Villas-Boas and Sherwood last season.

That is the hope, that the Argentinian coach and his methods will be able to galvanise a group of talented players by the time the season starts on August 16.

If it doesn’t, then Pochettino will simply become another name who tried and failed at Tottenham.
