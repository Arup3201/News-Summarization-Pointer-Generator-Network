Mr Esterhuysen directed his ire at firebrand politician Julius Malema (pictured) and others

A newsreader was sacked today after he repeatedly swore during an astonishing on-air rant.

South African radio presenter Mark Esterhuysen, 23, was dismissed after using the F-word 13 times during an angry and incoherent outburst which was broadcast live.

The news presenter started his hourly bulletin at 1am this morning in Johannesburg by introducing himself as normal before beginning his furious tirade.

During the 40-second rant he repeatedly swore as he directed his ire at various targets including a group of police officers accused of murdering a member of the public, firebrand politician Julius Malema and the country's right-wing Afrikaner AWB party.

Esterhuysen then expressed anger about being stuck on his network's overnight 'graveyard shift' before inviting listeners to follow his blog and then storming out of the studio.

During the incredible rant he said: 'Good morning, I'm Mark Esterhuysen.F*** racism. F*** the pigs who killed Andries Tatane. F*** the AWB. F*** racism. We are all wild animals meant to live free.

'F*** capitalism. F*** fascism. F*** this f***ing wage slavery graveyard shit.

'F*** domestication. F*** Malema. F*** the state. F*** the petrol economic growth on a finite planet.

'This is the only f***ing planet we have.'

As producers switched on some background music in the hope of drowning out the outburst, he added: "If you don't agree with me please see my blog.

'Peace, love, respect, anarchy. 

'Follow me on Twitter. You can see me on Facebook as well.'

Esterhuysen's employers at the Johannesburg-based 702 Talk Radio station today confirmed he had been fired following the outburst.

The presenter had worked for the nationally-broadcast Eyewitness News network for around four months after starting his career in student radio.

In a statement the channel apologised to listeners for the foul-mouthed rant.

The statement said: "Eyewitness News and Talk Radio 702 apologise to our listeners for the comments made during what was supposed to be the news bulletin at 1am this morning.

"EWN does not condone what the news anchor Mark Esterhuysen said at this time instead of reading the news.

"Mark's contract with EWN has been terminated with immediate effect and once again, we apologise to our listeners." 

Esterhuysen was today unavailable for comment about the incident.

On his profile on Twitter the broadcaster describes himself as an 'enemy of the state' and a 'defender of anarchy'.

His reference during his rant to the death of Andries Tatane followed the black teacher's death during a protest in April.

The incident sparked a public outcry in South Africa after footage was broadcast on national television which showed Tatane being savagely beaten by police.

Six officers were later arrested and have been charged with murder.
