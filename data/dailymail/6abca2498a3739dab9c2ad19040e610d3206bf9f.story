Russell Brand could face deportation from the United States and a subsequent ban if he is convicted of felony criminal damage.

It's all heavily dependent on his immigration status, and the outcome when the case gets to court.

If a judge finds him guilty of an aggravated felony, which could include the theft of the phone he snatched before hurling it through a window in New Orleans, Russell may face a jail term.

If this is the case, his status in the US could be considered given that he isn't a US citizen.

Brand, 36 , was planning to go down 
the naturalization route as the spouse of an American, and based a stand
up show around it last Autumn.

His Los Angeles show at the Elephant 
theatre in Hollywood saw him ask the audience to help him pass the test 
so he could stay with his wife.

The comic may even ruefully reflect about how he joked about persuading the US to accept a man with his reputation.

The route to citizenship for a spouse
takes three years but this increases to five for an immigrant who is 
not married to an American.

Judge Cristina Pérez told Mail Online: 'If Russell is on a work visa and is found guilty of a felony, it would almost certainly affect his future in the US.

'Immigration law is complicated and any offence deemed an aggravated felony can result in deportation and a ban for immigrant professionals.

'However, Russell's legal team aren't likely to let it get that far, and will be preparing to argue for the incident to be reduced to a misdemeanor, this is almost certainly what will happen in this case in my opinion.'

They need to have lived in the US with a green card for five years, which Russell hasn't yet chalked up.

Of course, he could be found not guilty, or guilty of just felony.

The authorities are also likely to take into account Russell's unique abilities as an entertainer.

This contribution to culture could balance out this incident to ensure he stays in the United States.

He may have suffered the humiliation 
of being arrested in New Orleans yesterday, but he wasn't about to go to
ground in the southern city.

Indeed,
the renowned ladies man, back on the prowl again since his marriage 
break up, was parading himself around the streets of the city's 
hedonistic French Quarter last night.

Affixed to his side was the current 
ubiquitous brunette, who had formed part of his entourage earlier in the
day as he left the sheriff's office.

TMZ spotted the indefatigable Brit as he soaked up the atmosphere in the lively area, which they describe as: 'party central.'

Earlier in the day, his mugshot had been released.

With his head tilted softly to the 
side, and a flattering light highlighting his soft expression, one could
be forgiven for thinking this were another promotional photo for the 
popular actor.

The 36-year-old comedian turned himself in to police in New Orleans Sheriff's office yesterday after learning he was wanted by officers.

According to TMZ, Russell was charged on two counts of simple criminal damage to property.

He was then released after posting a reported $5000 bail.

Russell's camp were quick to make 
amends and have reportedly paid $240 to the photographer over the 
incident, according to the website.

The
comedian was seen leaving the police station with his mystery female 
friend who he has been spending increasing time with in recent months - 
she was also present when the incident took place on Monday.

The New Orleans police told website TMZ they issued a misdemeanor warrant for the his arrest on Wednesday night.

The comedian, who is in the city to film an untitled feature with Juliette Hough, was accused of 
snatching a paparazzo's mobile phone and angrily hurling it through a 
pane of glass in New Orleans on Monday night.

Russell has since offered a 
bizarre defence for allegedly throwing the iPhone through the window - 
saying he was honouring Steve Jobs.

In
an apparent confession, he claims his apparent fit of temper was 
because he believed the way the photographer was using his smartphone 
dishonoured the memory of the recently deceased Apple CEO.

He said: 'Since Steve Jobs died I cannot bear to see anyone use an iphone irreverently, what I did was a tribute to his memory.'

Brand was reported by photographer Timothy Jackson, who is accusing the Get Him To The Greek star of criminal damages.

He
told officers he was with a group of other photographers, and had began
to take pictures of the star with his iPhone from his car.

He claims the angry funnyman lost his 
temper, grabbed the phone from of his hand, and threw it through the 
window of a local law firm.

Damage control: It has been reported that a production assistant on Russell's film offered $240 on his behalf to repair the broken window

According to TMZ, a man who was inside the office during the incident said people connected to the actor tried to smooth things over with him after the incident.

Brand's representative acknowledged he had thrown the phone, and a production assistant on the star's movie allegedly turned up with $240 to replace the damaged window.

The man also told the website he returned the phone to the photographer after the police arrived.
