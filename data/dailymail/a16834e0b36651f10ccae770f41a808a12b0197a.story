The British scientist on the Rosetta Project who came under fire over wearing a shirt with semi-dressed cartoons while appearing on TV after the Philae landing, has apologised.

Dr Matt Taylor spoke about the European Space Agency's mission to land a robot on a comet for the first time in history, while dressed in a colourful bowling shirt featuring scantily clad women.

Soon afterwards, #shirtgate and slightly more humorous #shirtstorm, began trending on Twitter in response to the London-born father-of-two.

Apology: Dr Matt Taylor appeared close to tears and was visibly upset he apologised for his choice of shirt following a furious online response

Today, during a Rosetta project briefing on the European Space Agency's YouTube channel, a visibly upset Dr Taylor addressed the internet furore and said sorry.

'I made a big mistake,' the 40-year-old, who has a PhD in space plasma physics from Imperial College London said.

'And I have offended many people. I'm very sorry about this.' 

Even before the landing, the Rosetta Project scientist caused a stir on the social network because of his unorthodox appearance, involving bright shirts and an array of body art - including a tattoo on his leg of the space probe landing on the comet, which he got in January. 

However, the 40-year-old's choice of a shirt covered in women in PVC and lingerie broke the online science network in ways Kim Kardashian's bare bottom could only dream of.

Many vented their anger on Twitter, claiming that Dr Taylor's choice of shirt was sexist and particularly inappropriate as science is a field long dominated by men.

#shirtgate: Dr Matt Taylor, Rosetta Project Scientist, has caused a stir on Twitter because of his dress sense

Both men and women blasted Dr Taylor, accusing him of not caring about women in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).

'I don't care what scientists wear. But a shirt featuring women in lingerie isn't appropriate for a broadcast if you care about women in STEM,' astrophysicist Katie Mack tweeted.

She later added in response to a fellow tweeter; 'You think a shirt like this makes women feel welcome? I don't.' 

'The fact that a scientist of any gender, but especially a man, would think it's a good idea to wear a shirt covered in naked women while representing a major space agency and a significant research project is appalling; and clearly, he had no idea that he was engaging in exactly the kind of casual sexism that drives women away from STEM, writer Susan  Smith pointed out on XOJane.  

During an interview about the landing, Dr Taylor had branded the comet landing 'the sexiest mission there’s ever been. 

'She’s sexy, but I never said she was easy.'

Before the emergence of #shirtgate, Dr Taylor, a father-of-two and the son of a brick layer, praised on Twitter for being 'a proper cool scientist' and 'definitely not boring'. 

One Twitter user wrote: 'Dr Matt Taylor is what every scientist should look like - rad shirt, sleeve tattoos. Rad,' while another said: 'Matt Taylor causing thousands of people to choke on their cornflakes this morning.'

The father-of-two from Manor Park in north east London now lives in the Netherlands with his wife Leanne and children Lily, 13 and Harry, 11.

Dr Taylor studied at the University of Liverpool and Imperial College London, winning a PhD in space plasma physics

He has worked at the European Space Agency since 2005 and was given the top scientific job on the mission in the summer of 2013.

The role was a real change from his previous job, which was studying the physics of the northern lights, The Guardian reported.  

On Wednesday's ESA's Rosetta probe released its Philae lander to attempt the first ever landing of a spacecraft on the surface of a comet.

The separation was confirmed at 9.03am GMT, with pictures of Philae approaching the comet expected throughout the day before it lands on the surface at 3.30pm GMT.

But the success of the mission now hangs in the balance after a thruster on Philae was found to be faulty.

Mission controllers say there is a 50 per cent chance the cold thruster positioned on top of the lander will work, and without it, Philae will have to rely solely on harpoons to attach to the surface of the comet. The cold thruster was designed to push Philae closer to the comet. 

The scientist is so positive that the mission to land on the comet will be successful that he has already had the moment permanently etched on his body (pictured)

To convince his new team of his dedication, Dr Taylor promised that if Rosetta woke up from its hibernation, he would get a tattoo to commemorate the event. This video shows the creation of the tattoo

Rosetta has chased comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko through space for more than ten years in what has been described as 'the sexiest, most fantastic mission ever'. After a four billion mile (6.5 billion km) journey, it is now positioned in an orbit 19 miles (30 km) away from 67P
