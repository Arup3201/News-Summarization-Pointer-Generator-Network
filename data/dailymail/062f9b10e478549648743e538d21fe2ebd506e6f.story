It's the $13,000 bike lane that runs for just 30 metres but the Melbourne council that introduced it says it's a raging success.

The European-style bike lane in Hampton, south-east of Melbourne, was introduced last month and allows cyclists to travel in the opposite direction to vehicles.

The painted path, known as a contraflow lane, on Thomas Street enables cyclists to travel in both directions for the 30 metres on the one-way stretch of road.

Bayside Council said it hasn't received any reports of confusion by road users, from either cyclists or motorists since the bike lane was introduced.

'A painted bike lane physically separates motorists from cyclists. Signage is also installed to direct cyclists and other roads users of the changed conditions,' the council's director of infrastructure, Steven White, said.

'On-site observations have found that the treatment has also reduced the speed of vehicles turning into Thomas Street from Hampton Street.

'This observation aligns with research from Europe, where contraflow lanes are used extensively in towns with one way streets, that has found contraflow cycling reduces the risks of accidents.'

City of Sydney Council has four contraflow lanes bike lanes across the city.

'Contra-flow lanes can improve safety for bicycle riders by allowing them choose a route that avoids a busy road or intersection, for example,' a spokeswoman said.  

'All run for the full length of the street or for the full length of the one-way section of the street.

'International studies have also shown a reduction in crashes from contra-flow bike lanes. In northern Europe, all one way streets allow contraflow travel by bike unless signed otherwise.'

The NSW Roads and Maritime Services department issued a technical direction earlier this year on contraflow provision for bikes, including the recommendation that 'councils assess existing one-way streets for suitability for contra-flow bicycle facilities'.

'Bike lanes keep riders safe – research by Transport for NSW shows that separated bike lanes have doubled the number of cyclists on the road but led to fewer total injuries among them,' Sydney's Lord Mayor Clove Moore said.

The number of daily bike trips in the City of Sydney local government area has increased from 25,868 in March 2010 to 60,098 in March 2014, according to the council's independent research.

'Even a completed network of separated cycleways could not cover every street and road. Bike riders have the right to use our streets and roads, and as more people choose to ride other road users need to be aware of how vulnerable bike riders and pedestrians are,' Ms Moore said.

It comes as Bicycling WA, a cyclist activist group in Perth, has called on its government to reduce speed limits on suburban roads from 50 to 30km/h as part of its strategy to double the number of cyclists by 2020, the West Australian reports.

Jeremy Murray, Bicycling WA's chief executive, said with more riders on the road, bike lane infrastructure was necessary to avoid accidents.

In the past 12 months, the number of cyclists being treated at Perth's trauma unit has risen 45 percent, with doctors saying the severity of injuries increasing.

'The worst injuries we've had are people getting run over by trucks, dragged under them... some are losing limbs, having muscles ripped off bones,' the State Major Trauma unit director, Sudhakar Rao said. 

Mr Murrary said the figures were concerning and there was often a misconception in terms of a rider's rights.

'They are legally allowed to ride two abreast, they are allowed to be on the road,' he said.

'But there are also behaviours that cyclists are involved in... you get them doing stupid things on the roads, not indicating, riding without helmets.'

But not everyone is as thrilled as the council about the new bike lane with some taking to social media to vent their concerns
