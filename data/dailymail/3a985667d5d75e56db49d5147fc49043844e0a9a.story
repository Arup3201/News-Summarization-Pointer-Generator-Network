The chief of Virgin Galactic has revealed that a replacement spaceship will be flying by April - just six months after last week's disastrous crash in the Mojave Desert in which the co-pilot was killed.

George Whitesides, the company's chief executive, said construction of the second spaceship is already 65 per cent complete.

Like its doomed predecessor, Enterprise, the new spaceship's name is a tribute to both Nasa and Star Trek. It will be called SS Voyager, the Sunday Times reports.

Just nine days ago, Virgin Galactic's experimental space craft disintegrated over the Californian desert when its feathering system deployed prematurely and aerodynamic forces tore it apart.

Co-pilot Michael Alsbury was killed in the accident and pilot Peter Siebold was seriously injured but managed to escape after activating his parachute system.

An inquiry into the crash is said to be focusing on the decision by Mr Alsbury to push a lever allowing the spaceship's two wings to be moved as it broke the sound barrier. 

Per Wimmer, an adventurer who knew both pilots, said they were both 'extremely competent' and claimed the action would be 'a very strange error to make'.

Killed: Co-pilot Michael Alsbury, who was a father-of-two, died in last week's

Disaster: An investigation has revealed that Virgin Galactic's SpaceShipTwo did not explode in mid-air due to fuel ignition - but it could have come apart for mechanical reasons after one of the pilots pulled a lever

It has emerged that nine months ago, a group of ten of the firm's customers had written to Virgin Galactic expressing their concerns over the space programme's delays.

Each had paid a £125,00 deposit to be among the first to be taken into space - and two of the group have now asked for refunds.

At least 24 of the wealthy investors who signed up to be among Richard Branson's first space tourists have given up their tickets.

Peter Ulrich von May, an asset manager based in Switzerland, told The Independent he no longer wishes to travel into space with Virgin Galactic and he has demanded his money back.

He said: 'I want out. I subscribed seven years ago at 63, am still an active private pilot and in good health but who knows how long it will now take. I have already informed VG of my wish - no reply yet.

The Daily Mail reported that one of the program's highest-profile customers, Princess Beatrice, will not be boarding the Virgin Galactic spacecraft after the disaster last week.

'Beatrice was excited by the idea of space tourism, but there is no way she will be going on one of the flights, if they are ever allowed to take place,' a source close to Buckingham Palace revealed. 

Many celebrities continue to support the programme and among the ticket holders are Lady Gaga, Katy Perry, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks, Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt and Justin Bieber.

Chief Executive Mr Whitesides also revealed that the company is 18 months away from unveiling another test vehicle, called LauncherOne. It is a 50ft long unmanned rocket that will carry small satellites into orbit.

And a Scottish test pilot, David Mackay, is expected to fly Virgin Galactic's WhiteKnight Two over the Mojave Desert in the next few days. 

The two-hulled plane is designed to carry spaceships into the upper atmosphere and is known as Eve after Richard Branson's mother.
