At the 1982 World Cup the only way Italy managed to stop Diego Maradona was to task their hard-nosed centre-back Claudio Gentile with man-marking the diminutive star.

Gentile committed 23 fouls on Argentina’s No 10 in Spain, as Italy triumphed 2-1 and left their opponents needing to beat Brazil in their next match to advance - something they failed to do.

Thirty-two years later there were echoes of that famous hatchet job during Brazil’s match against Colombia in Fortaleza, as Fernandinho thundered into James Rodriguez at every opportunity to disrupt the Colombian’s rhythm.

Where's the ball? Fernandinho clatters into James Rodriguez in the first half of the match in Fortaleza

Agony: Rodriguez is left writhing in pain after Fernandinho's first foul in Fortaleza

In the 14th minute the Manchester City midfielder flew into a challenge on Rodriguez in the centre circle, making little attempt to win the ball and clearly catching the Monaco man.

The referee gave Colombia a free-kick, buts somehow Fernandinho avoided a booking.

It has been suggested already during the tournament that the hosts have been getting more than their fair share of refereeing decision, and this was a clear example of leniency towards Brazil trumping reason.

Ten minutes later Fernandinho was at it again, clattering into Colombia’s No 10 and getting none of the ball just inside the Brazil half.

The referee again spotted the foul, but again Fernandinho was not shown a card to match his shirt.

Then, right on the brink of half-time, Rodriguez was uprooted by Brazil's midfielder enforcer for a third time.

For a third time the referee turned a blind eye, as Fernandinho trudged off at half-time with no booking to his name.

The last foul was his 10th in Brazil's two most recent games.
