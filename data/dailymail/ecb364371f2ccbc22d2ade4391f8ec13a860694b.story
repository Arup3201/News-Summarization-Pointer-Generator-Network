Researchers at University College London found it is natural for people to bump into lamp posts if they aren't looking directly at them

Scientists have shed light on why it is so easy to bump into a lamppost despite carefully walking along a busy street.

They have found that when we concentrate hard on looking at some things, others appear dimmer, just as if the light has been turned down on them.

This, they say, explains why sometimes we look but donâ€™t see.

The University College London researchers asked a group of volunteers to remember where squares of different colours flashed up on a screen.

Sometimes, they just had to memorise one square, other times, it was much harder, with six squares.

They were also asked a question about a black and white pattern that was also on the screen.

When the task involving the coloured squares was easy, they got the question right 95 per cent of the time.

But when it was difficult, accuracy dropped to 64 per cent.

Altering the contrast of the black and white pattern throughout the experiment, revealed that 50 per cent more contrast was needed for the volunteers to see it as clearly when doing the hard task.

In other words, it appeared dimmer.

Researcher Nilli Lavie, said this could help explain why when we are looking hard at one thing â€“ such as how to dodge people walking down a busy street â€“ we miss something right in front of our eyes, such as a lamppost.

We can lose our footing by accidentally focusing on distant objects rather than nearby obstructions

The knowledge, detailed in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, could also help make jobs that involve processing a lot of visual information safer.

This includes pilots, who have to watch numerous dials and instruments, and surgeons, who are at risk of information overload while carrying out complex operations.
