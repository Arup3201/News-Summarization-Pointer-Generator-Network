The mother of a teenager killed when a huge tree crushed her caravan as she slept has spoken of her 'absolute devastation'.

Talented sportswoman, Bethany Freeman, was crushed when a 30ft (9m) tree fell down amid high winds in Hever, near Edenbridge, Kent, yesterday morning.

Today her mother Tess Peirce said her family was devastated by the death of the 17-year-old grammar school pupil.

Victim: Bethany Freeman, 17, died being comforted by her mother after a tree crashed through her caravan and crushed her while she slept in her bed in Kent

In a statement issued through Kent Police, Ms Peirce said: 'We are all absolutely devastated at the loss of my daughter.

'I would like to thank the emergency services for their tremendous efforts in attempting to save her.'

Gutherie Freeman, Bethany's brother, has also paid tribute to his sister saying she was the best sibling he could have asked for.

He told the Evening Standard that his sister was 'incredibly popular' and loveable. 

He added: 'The heart of the crowd and an absolute motivator for everyone. She loved and listened to everyone and just made everyone feel happy around her.'

Bethany was a 'universally respected' 
sixth-form pupil at Tunbridge Wells Grammar School who 'had everything 
to look forward to', the school’s website said.

There
were tragic scenes as her driving instructor arrived at her home to 
pick her up without knowing she had died, and neighbours told of her 
mother's desperate attempts to comfort her daughter as she lay dying

She was among four people killed as hurricane-force winds battered England and Wales, leaving a trail of destruction.

'Loving
husband' and father-of-three Donal Drohan, 51, originally from 
Waterford in Ireland, died when his car was hit by a tree near the 
bridge over the River Colne in Watford, Hertfordshire.

Mr Drohan, from Harrow, west London, was killed when his car was struck by a falling tree in Lower High Street.

In Hounslow, west London, three houses were destroyed and two others were damaged by an explosion, thought to have been caused by a ruptured gas main.

Officers were called to Bath Road at around 7.30am and at noon they found a man’s body at number 47 amid 'scenes of devastation'.

An hour and a half later, a woman - whom investigators were trying to identify - was found dead at the same property.

The four deaths yesterday followed that of Dylan Alkins, 14, on Sunday, who is presumed drowned after being swept away by 20ft waves while playing with friends in Newhaven, East Sussex.

The search is continuing for the schoolboy today as friends hold an emotional vigil for him on the beach where he disappeared.

Balloons with hand-written messages on them were released into the sky and flowers were thrown into the sea in memory of Dylan, described by friends as 'kind'.

Some of those who gathered broke down in tears and hugged each other, while others paid tribute to the teenager.

One of his friends, Aaron Gilbert, 15, said: 'I couldn’t believe it.

'I was hoping it was just a bad dream. I woke up crying. We would come down every day in the summer but I never thought he would come down when it was really rough.

'I wish I could have stopped him.'

Hayden Hennessy, 14, showed off a bracelet which Dylan had given him as a gift.

'He gave me this bracelet and I only have this to remember him by,' he said. 'It makes me sad in a way.' He added: 'It just breaks my heart. I’m missing him.'

Witnesses said that Dylan was among several teenagers who had been playing around on the beach as wind speeds were whipped up by the St Jude storm.

Rescue teams, including a Coastguard helicopter and an RNLI lifeboat, scoured the area in what were described as 'atrocious conditions' with poor visibility on Sunday.

But as time passed without finding Dylan, coastguards stood down their operation which has now shifted to trying to recover the teenager.

Residents and business owners may face a second night in the dark after vast swathes of Britain suffered power outages.

Tens of thousands of people remain without power while commuters faced further delays to their journeys as the disruption from St Jude - the most powerful storm to hit Britain in years - continued.

Latest figures from UK Power Networks show that nearly 60,000 properties still have no electricity, more than 36 hours after the first outages.

Engineers say they are often unable to give those affected an estimate for when they are likely to be re-connected.

A spokesman said there were five times the normal number of engineers working to reinstate power, but said their main consideration was safety.

Matt Rudling, director of services at UK Power Networks, said: 'We are working to restore all supplies as quickly and as safely as possible.

'A lot of hard work is going on round the clock, behind the scenes and we are making good progress with repairs.'

Around half a million homes and businesses are thought to have been affected since the storm first touched the British mainland overnight on Sunday, with the South of England bearing the brunt.

And while many train services have been reinstated following yesterday’s severely disrupted operations, rail users were still asked to check travel times as delays were reported.

During yesterday morning, winds of up to 100mph swept through the South West, South, South East, the Midlands and the East of England after first hitting land in the early hours.

Up to 2.4in (6cm) of rain - half the monthly average - fell in just a few hours during the storm in areas including Hampshire and Devon, causing flash floods.

Met Office spokeswoman Laura Young warned that the impacts from the storm are still around and urged the public to remain alert.

John Lee, a forecaster for the MeteoGroup, the weather division of the Press Association, said it was the most powerful storm in years.

'There will no doubt be some disruption still following the damage caused by strong winds and heavy rain, but the weather will be quite different,' he said.

'It will be blustery with some showers, especially in the west, but a lot lighter.

'On Friday there is an indication that stormy weather could return, but it’s likely to bring heavy rain rather than strong winds.'
