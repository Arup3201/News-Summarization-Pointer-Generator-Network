The 19-year-old Florida cheerleader charged with carrying on a sexual relationship with a 14-year-old girl has claimed that she had no idea that she was breaking the law.

Dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit, Kaitlyn Hunt sat down with a NewsChannel5 reporter Tuesday for her first jailhouse interview since entering a plea deal late last week.

On Thursday, Hunt pleaded no contest to battery, interference with child custody and contributing to the dependency of a child.

Sense of betrayal: Hunt said while she still cares for her young ex-paramour, she no longer has the same love for her she had had before the scandal

'I never was educated on dating laws and ages and stuff so I still was confused about everything,' the 19-year-old insisted during the interview. 'I didn't know why I was in trouble.'

Miss Hunt was charged in February with having sex with a 14-year-old student at Sebastian River High School. Hunt was 18 at the time and also attended the school.

A previous plea deal was withdrawn in August following allegations that Hunt exchanged thousands of explicit texts with the girl and sent her nude photos - a move she has since come to regret.

‘I trusted her as not only my friend but my girlfriend too.  I felt I got set up in multiple ways and I got hurt by her.’ Hunt said.

A judge revoked her bond, sending her to jail. Prosecutors added a charge of transmitting material harmful to a minor.

Addressing her feelings toward her former flame, Hunt said that she still cares for the girl ‘as a person,’ but she no longer has the same love for her she did before.

Hunt also expressed regret that she had never gotten the chance to speak to her ex-girlfriend’s parents about their relationship.

‘I would have respected their wishes and I would have sat down with them and had a conversation with them and it would have been different,’ she said.

The young woman, however, insisted that her 14-year-old paramour’s family do not deserve an apology from her.

Under the terms of Thursday's deal, Hunt will be released just in time for Christmas.

After regaining her freedom December 
20, Hunt plans to go back to school to study nursing. She will have to 
serve three years’ probation, including two years of house arrest.

The
 19-year-old also wants to spearhead a campaign with her attorney meant 
to overhaul state laws that pertain to relationships between high 
school-age teenagers.

In an earlier interview with Good morning America, Hunt has insisted that the 14-year-old was not a victim, even though her parents claimed the girl was feeling threatened.

'The
 threatening tone... put her in a place where she felt she had to 
abide,' the father of the victim, who has not been named, told GMA.

But Hunt defended her messages to the 14-year-old, explaining that it had been a tough time for her.

If she sticks to the conditions of the deal, she will not be a convicted felon per Florida law. She would then have the possibility of sealing her file and having the case expunged after 10 years.

The case
 has garnered national attention as the teenager's supporters have 
claimed that the younger girl's parents only contacted police about the 
relationship because Hunt is gay.

She was charged with two counts of 
lewd and lascivious battery in February and jailed before posting 
$5,000. She was banned from contacting the younger girl, whom she had 
met at high school.

Under
 Florida law, even if the relationship was consensual, it is illegal for
 anyone over the age of 18 to have sexual relations with anyone under 
that age. At the time of their relationship, Hunt was 18.

'Threatening tone': The victim's father said his daughter felt pressured by Hunt's text messages

Arrest: Hunt was arrested again in August after prosecutors allegedly discovered she had sent 20,000 text messages to her victim since March, including some of a sexual nature. She has been in jail ever since

Third chance: Hunt, pictured in court on Wednesday, has been offered
 a third plea deal which would see her in jail until December 20. She would then have to spend two years under house arrest

But court documents in August accused Hunt of 'covertly
 contacting her victim thousands of times' on an iPod she smuggled to 
the girl and even of telling her to 'Keep the f**k quiet' about it.

The new evidence indicated Hunt and the 
girl, until July, were in contact almost daily since Hunt's last day
 at Sebastian River High School in March.

Hunt also allegedly sent more than 25 lewd photos of herself 
which show her nude or 'masturbating while moaning'.

They
 also allege that Hunt's mother, Kelley Hunt Smith, may have helped her 
daughter cover her tracks by messaging the girl, urging her to delete 
all trace of their contact.

According
 to prosecutors, Hunt's girlfriend told detectives about the continued 
illicit contact and how Hunt would 'drive the child to a remote location
 where they would have intimate physical contact.'

Happier times: Kaitlyn maintains the relationship with her female classmate was consensual

New revelations: Kaitlyn Hunt is now accused of sending some 20,000 messages to her underage lover, breaching a court order. And documents say her mom Kelly, right, helped her

On or around May 21, the documents allege, Hunt discovered her lover had told her parents about their continued relationship.

'F**k you…you're stupid,' she wrote. 
'You want me to go in jail...You're such a messed up person...you 
snitched on me. God only knows what you'll do when pressed in court. 
Bye.'

But the pair continued their contact - and Hunt's mother found out.

'Delete
 EVERYTHING,' Smith wrote in a text message to the girl. 'PLEASE delete 
everything and make sure NO ONE finds out you've spoken to Kate at all.'

The younger girl's parents have remained adamant that Hunt should be prosecuted as a sex offender.
