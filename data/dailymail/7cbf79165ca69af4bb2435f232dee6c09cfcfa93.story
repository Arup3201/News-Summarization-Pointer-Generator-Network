A mother-of-four has spent £25,000 on surgery to look like a 'rich b***h' after having work done to her eyes, jaw, chest and tummy. 

Overweight India Buchan was so fed up of looking at herself in the mirror she decided to spend her life savings on plastic surgery. 

So far she has spent £4,000 on a gastric band, £6,500 on a tummy tuck and £1,300 for a facial thread.

She also sold jewellery to help pay for liposuction on her jaw, a mini facelift an upper eyelid lift, a boob job, Botox and chemical peels.

Mrs Buchan told The Sunday People: 'I want to look like a plastic rich b***h. Give me Sharon Osbourne any day because she looks absolutely fabulous.'

India, who has been divorced twice, remembers being teased at school for being fat and said her weight has fluctuated over the years.

By the age of 16 she was a size 14 and weighed 11 stone but had been diagnosed with the eating disorder bulimia.

However, when she reached 50 she was now a size 22 and weighed 16 stone.

It was at that point she had a discussion with her husband of nine years Nigel, 62, and decided to go ahead with the surgery. 

According to a British doctor she was not large enough to qualify for a gastric band so she requested the help of a doctor in Belgium who agreed to carry out the procedure.

Following the gastric band, Mrs Buchan went on to have a tummy tuck at London's Queen Elizabeth Hospital before undergoing surgery on her face and breasts in Croatia.

'At that moment I started to resemble who I wanted to be, moving towards a Sophia Loren look.'

India has now had six operations and doesn't plan to stop there.

She is now hoping to get rid of her bingo wings and flabby skin.

Her 34-year-old daughter Hazel even says her mother looks better than her now.

Before
 surgery, Mrs Buchan had 36EE size breasts and described them as 'unruly
 St Bernard puppies' but now she says she is much happier with her 36Es 
which 'stay in a bra'.

'They were all over the place and wrinkly. I could tuck my nipples into my waistband',
