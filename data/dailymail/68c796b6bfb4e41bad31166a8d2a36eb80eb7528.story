Two Scrabble experts have lifted the lid on how to win at the popular board game - just in time for Christmas.

The experts have revealed that if you fancy winning against your relatives, it's best to make sure at least one of your seven letters is an S.

And words without vowels like brrr, grrl, pfft, and psst will also help you clinch you the title.

According to UK Scrabble expert Barry Grossman, there are at least 100 different ways players can win

Grrl, of course, is a female internet 
user, and psst a bid to get someone's attention. Pfft is an expression 
of discontent, and brrr a way to say you are cold.

And euoi, a cry of Bacchic frenzy, is remembered by connosieurs using the phrase Excessive Units Of Intoxication.

Jiao, a monetary unit in Japan, is given the mnemonic: John Is Always Out.

Experts have also revealed that American words can
 be used as the game was invented in the States back in 1938.

UK Scrabble champion Barry Grossman even says there is a time and place for proper nouns - which are normally banned.

His own first name, for example, is Australian slang for a blunder or mistake.

Grossman suggests the more words in a person's vocabulary, the better, and knowing the more rare and unusual words can benefit the most in Scrabble.

For example:

Epopoeia - an epic poem

Psst - a word used to capture someone's attention inconspicuously

Brrr - used to signify being cold

Barry - another word for a blunder

Euoi - cry of Bacchic frenzy

Qat - a variant spelling of the word khat, which is an evergreen shrub

Jiao - a monetary unit in China

Equally 'danny' and plural 'dannies', is acceptable to describe a child's hand.

In his book, 101 Ways To Win At Scrabble, Grossman explains that two-letter words may seem like a cheap way to bag a point, but they are in fact essential to move the game on.

There are also 120 two letter words which serious Scrabble players learn off by heart.

Words like ax, ex, xi, and xu - using the eight-point 'x' tile - are invaluable, he says.

Many dictionaries now have a page detailing all the accepted two-letter words, described as the 'glue' of Scrabble including jo, es and ta.

There are also a host of three-letter words, such as iff, roc, and ulu that can be useful.

Explaining the four-letter words without vowels - pfft, psst, grrl, and brrr - Grossman makes clear that only these spelling are accepted and no extra Fs, Ss or Rs can be added.

To be the best, Grossman advises knowing many words - but not necessarily the entire dictionary.

It helps, he says, to know obscure ones like epopoeia, an epic poem, pshcent, an ancient Egyptian crown, and ttchick, a clicking sound.

Allan Simmons, a finalist in this year's National Scrabble Championships, says most amateur players ruin their chances by creating unnecessary tactics.

'Don't avoid playing your best move because you are worried about what your opponent might be able to score off of it,' Simmons said.

Words like 'euoi', 'jiao', 'brrr', and 'grrl' are essential, alongside 'epopoeia' and proper nouns including 'Barry'

'If you are scoring well and paying attention to the balance of letters left on your rack then it will serve you well not to be too defensive.'

Grossman said: 'There are all sorts of tricks that can help players impress their families when the Scrabble board comes out at Christmas.

'One of the best things is known as a Benjamin - a three-letter extension on the front of a five-letter word so BRICK becomes AIRBRICK and JUMPS becomes OUTJUMPS.'

Ultimately, Grossman claims that sometimes tiles need to be swapped, which means that player misses a go, but they may get a better selection of letters and a higher score as a result.

Another key thing to remember is that the letter 'Q' doesn't always need to be followed by a 'U'.

In the two-letter list the word QI is 'a variant of chi'.

Nationals: Finalist Alan Simmons said most amateur players ruin their chances by tactically saving their words

While Qat (a variant spelling of the word khat; an evergreen shrub), Qaid (a Muslim chief) and sheqalim (the plural of sheqel, the currency of Israel) are examples of longer words where this technique can be used.

Another way to steal points from the words already placed on the board by opponents, as listed in Grossman's book, is to take advantage of prefixes and suffixes.

These included 'ed', 'ing' and adding the letter S to the end of words, yet Grossman adds the suffix 'ish' is rare and equally effective, especially on words such as pixyish.

Though the letter 'S' and the blank tile are the best tiles to select, they should be used sparingly as there are only four, according to Grossman's book.

An S, for example, should only be used when adding it increases the overall score by around five points, otherwise it's a 'waste'.
