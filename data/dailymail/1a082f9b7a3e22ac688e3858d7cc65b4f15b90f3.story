A Lufthansa flight travelling from Manchester to Munich was forced to abort its journey and land at a different German airport after an ‘unusual odour’ was detected in the cockpit on Thursday morning.

Flight LH2505 was carrying 82 passengers when it declared an emergency over south-western Germany around 8:30am and diverted to Stuttgart Airport.

The Airbus A321-231 was met by ambulances and fire trucks when it landed safely around 20 minutes later.

Lufthansa spokesman Martin Riecken told MailOnline Travel that the pilots ‘noted an unusual odour in the cockpit’, which caused the diversion.

He said oxygen masks were not deployed.

A passenger said: ‘It was really calm. The pilot and air hostess were great and knew exactly what they were doing.

‘They kept us informed throughout the decision to do an emergency landing.’

Stuttgart Airport described it as a ‘precautionary landing’ due to a technical problem on board the plane.

Other flights were held until the Lufthansa aircraft landed and the airport resumed normal operations following the emergency.
