Pole-vaulter Holly Bleasdale broke down in tears and put her head in her hands as her dream of becoming an Olympic medallist died last night.

But the British athlete's day ended on a high note as she revealed that her boyfriend, Paul Bradshaw, had asked her to marry him.

She announced the news on the instant messaging website Twitter and informed her 16,000 followers that she had said yes.

Mixed emotions: Holly Bleasdale looked dejected after she failed to win a medal in the Olympic pole vault final, but she later revealed that she was getting married

She tweeted: '6th in the Olympics and @bradshaaaw proposes to me :) epic day!!!'

Mr Bradshaw wrote on his own Twitter page: 'I have just proposed to @HollyBleasdale and she said yes!!!!! Best day ever!'

Earlier, Bleasdale, 20, had struggled to keep her composure as she attempted 4.55m for the third time in the Olympic pole vault final.

Taking deep breaths and appearing emotional even before she started her run-up, she repeatedly looked at her French coach, Julien Raffalli-Ebezant, for reassurance.

Springing a surprise: Pole-vaulter Holly Bleasdale finished sixth in the Olympic final

On her third attempt she fell far short of the bar and looked devastated when she came crashing down on to the mat.

Sitting with her hands in front of her face, she began to cry.

But a minute later she regained her composure, smiling and waving to the 80,000-strong crowd that had cheered her through the competition.

Speaking after the final, she said: 'I am trying to look at the positives and to finish in the top eight in my first Olympic final is pretty good, but I am just heartbroken with how it went today.

'I am only 20 and I feel like I could have performed well this year.'

Bleasdale, from Preston, smashed her own British indoor record and moved to second on the all-time world list with a clearance of 4.87m in January.

A size ten, she previously told the Mail she steers clear of internet forums after commenters accused her of being fat.

Miss Bleasdale, who has only been vaulting competitively for three years, said: ‘People on forums were asking “why doesn’t Holly look like the other athletes. Her coach should be doing something”.

'They were implying I was overweight and that my coach should be questioning why I wasn’t as lean.

‘But I know I need to be strong to do what I do.’

World champion Dai Greene could only manage fourth place in the final of the 400m hurdles.

The 26-year-old Welshman lost ground early on but fought back down the final straight, only to finish short of a medal in 48.24.
