Reports say she was last seen by her pickup truck.

At the time of Gray’s disappearance, the child car seats were found outside the truck, and her children were safe inside the YWCA, KLXH in Helena reports.

Her purse and cell phone were also reportedly left behind.

Gray ‘loves her children, her children love her, they are safe, I will say that. They are safe right now, and this is out of character for what we've seen here at the YWCA,’ Kellie Goodwin McBride, director of the YWCA, told KRTV.

Police searched a five-block radius on Wednesday evening to no avail.

The YMCA has started circulating posters around the town of Helena, in hopes that someone may have seen Gray or knows of her whereabouts.
