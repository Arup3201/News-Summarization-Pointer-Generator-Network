Tracked down: Robert Bill, 59, has been jailed for 20 years after attacking underage girls in Morocco

A British former teacher and playground designer was today sentenced to 20 years in prison for kidnapping and attempting to rape three young girls in Morocco.

Robert Bill, 59, from St Asaph, in Wales, has been jailed in the northern city of Tetouan, after being arrested in June 2013.

He was taken into custody after locals heard the cries of a six-year-old girl from his car in a parking garage.

Bill, who has previous convictions in Britain, was accused of luring children into his Spain-registered vehicle in order to attack them.

A six-year-old girl was found in the car by a group of adults who surrounded the car, and called the police.

Bill was also found guilty of kidnapping and attempting to rape another two Moroccan girls prior to his arrest - one in Tetouan and one in the nearby town of Chefchaouen.

Former victims looked on as he was led away from a criminal court in Tetouan late on Tuesday, when he was sentenced.

Mohammed Benaissa, of the Northern Observatory for Human Rights, told France's news agency AFP: 'We welcome this ruling, because it protects the children and it sends a warning to paedophiles.'

Bill, who was also fined the equivalent of some Â£6,000 pounds, denied all the charges, and has en days to appeal the verdict.

He worked as a teacher in Wales, and later ran a playground design business before being arrested in the UK.

In March 2009 he was imprisoned for six years following a trial at Caernarfon Crown Court for the attempted abduction of a five year-old girl in Holywell, Flintshire, in 2007.

Bill later appealed and after 
pleading guilty before a retrial, was then sentenced to a two year 
prison term at Chester Crown Court in 2010.

During his trials in Britain, Bill was described by a judge as a 'sexual predator'.

After leaving prison he travelled to southern Spain where he rented a two-bed cottage in a remote mountain hamlet an hour's drive from Malaga after jetting to Spain - and later got an office job at an estate agent's on the coast.

Locals told how he drove a Peugeot 106 with a 'baby on board' sticker in the back window despite not having a young child.

He disappeared after telling expats he befriended at a pub he had to return to Britain for emergency treatment for a throat problem.

Days later Spanish police revealed they were hunting him after obtaining CCTV footage of him bundling a 12-year-old Romanian youngster into his car.

The schoolgirl only escaped the sex pervert's clutches after escaping through an unlocked door before he sped off with her.

Bill, a Jehovah's Witness, was convicted in March 2009 of trying to abduct a five-year-old girl as he cruised around a council estate in Holywell, Wrexham in June 2007.

He was also found guilty of downloading child porn on his computer and indecently assaulting an eight-year-old girl.

He appealed against his conviction - but changed his plea to guilty shortly before a retrial and admitted breaching a Sex Offences Prevention Order (SOPO) by viewing videos of children on YouTube while on bail.
