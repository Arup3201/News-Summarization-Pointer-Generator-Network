A group of South West Trains clerks with more than 50 years service between them have been jailed for a ticketing scam which netted them over £150,000.

The office clerks - three men and three women - sold Oyster cards they had already created and 'charged up' with funds and fake rail tickets to unsuspecting passengers at Richmond station in south west London and then pocketed the money.

Their scam was uncovered in October 2012 when South West Trains bosses realised the accounts didn't balance at the Richmond station. A three month investigation was then launched by the British Transport Police and the group were arrested in January 2013.

Six South West Trains ticketing clerks used fake Oyster cards and fake train tickets to scam the company

Olufisayo Dada, 35, who was jailed for two years, left, and Linus Okrah, 45, who was jailed for 18 months

The group operated from London's Richmond station and were caught after a three month investigation

The clerks, Linus Okrah, 45, of Wanstead, David Rudland, 67, of Surrey, Julia Caan, 33, of Brentford, Alicia Dunn, 34, of Luton, Grace Oyegoke, 33, of Kent, and Olufisayo Dada, 35, of Brixton, were charged with conspiracy to commit fraud between October 2011 and January 2013.

Prosecutors at Kingston Crown Court said the clerks created fake Oyster cards which were preloaded with credit. The cards allowed passengers to complete their journeys, but their money was never given to South West Trains.

The group pocketed £68,000 in the scam.

The group also used ticket machines to create dodgy rail tickets for passengers travelling outside the Oyster card zone which earned them around £100,000.

The group sold prepaid Oyster cards to passengers and then pocketed the money, raking in £68,000

Alicia Dunn, 34, was sentenced to nine months jail and David Rudland, 67, was jailed for 13 months

Okrah was jailed for 18 months, Rudland was sentenced to 13 months and Cann and Dunn were both jailed for nine months.

Oyegoke was sentenced to nine months jail, suspended for two years, and was ordered to to do 150 hours of community work.

Detective Constable Becci Crampton said the group, who had more than 50 years service between them, threw away their careers 'for the sake of greed'.

He said throughout their trial the group denied any responsibility for the fraud, instead claiming 'the irregularities had been caused by technical faults with ticket machines'.

Tim Shoveller, Chief Executive of the South West Trains-Network Rail Alliance, said: 'This sends a clear sign that there is a severe price to pay for people who behave dishonestly and fraudulently. We would like to thank BTP and our own employees who have worked very hard in bringing this complex and detailed case to justice.'
