As if the eruption of Iceland's Bardarbunga volcano wasn't dramatic enough as it is, new footage has emerged which shows  lava bubbling and boiling and shooting into the sky as the Northern Lights swirl above.

The fissure eruption at Iceland’s active volcano is captured at close range by a helicopter which is flying perilously close to the crater.

The first part of the video is a time-lapse animation of the aurora borealis, often referred to as the Northern Lights, swirling above the volcano.

Suddenly a red cloud issues from the volcano like a giant Roman candle as the coloured mists which swirl all around make it a truly ethereal sight.

Then comes a dramatic a close-up view of lava fountains - filmed from a helicopter approximately 1km from the crater.

The fiery red geysers leap into the sky showing nature at its most raw and powerful.

Since August 16, a series of earthquakes in the area have created breaks in the Vatnajokull glacier, which is northeast of the volcano.

The tremors created cracks in the glacier, allowing streams of lava to pour through. 

 Although the area is remote and sparsely populated,  hikers turn up in their droves in the summer and officials had to evacuate all tourists in the region following some intense seismic activity
