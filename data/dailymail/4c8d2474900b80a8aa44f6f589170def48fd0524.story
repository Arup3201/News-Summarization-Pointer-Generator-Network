A wealthy banker is being prosecuted in a test case against Michael Gove’s ban on taking children out of school in term.

James Haymore took his three children to the US to attend a memorial service for their great-grandfather.

He refused to pay a £120 fine from his local council and will appear in court where he faces a £2,500 fine and a jail term.

Family: James and Dana Haymore, of Chelmsford, with their children Toby, 11, Brayden, eight, and Ellie, five

But the account manager at JP Morgan,
 who moved to Britain from America four years ago, says the decision 
breaches the Human Rights Act because it affects his children’s right to
 a family life.

He is being
 advised by Lib Dem MP John Hemming, who is backing Parents Want A Say, a
 campaign group that has collected a 200,000-signature petition against 
rules imposed by the Education Secretary to allow absences only in 
‘exceptional circumstances’.

Mr
 Haymore said he was ‘baffled’ by the decision of the head teacher at 
Chancellor Park primary school in Chelmsford, Essex, to block the 
six-day trip to California for Toby, 11 – but not his siblings Brayden, 
eight, and Ellie, five.

Changes: Education Secretary Michael Gove (pictured at a schools awards day last Wednesday) tightened the rules from last September to prevent unnecessary disruption to children's education

The school said Toby, who had been ill and had days off to attend grammar school open days, had a poor attendance record.

But
 Mr Haymore pointed out that Toby achieved the school’s highest 11-plus 
test results and had been offered a place at one of the best grammars in
 the region, adding: ‘Our eldest son is academically the star pupil of 
his class.

‘One member
 of staff was amazed that we were being fined. She said if any of the 
students could miss a week without it affecting his education, it was 
him.

‘We are good people. 
I’ve never even been to court before. I just hope challenging the system
 will help to change it.’ The rules about children missing school in 
term were tightened in September in an attempt to drive up standards.

But
 parents have complained they are too draconian, stopping children 
attending relatives’ weddings and funerals or taking holidays when 
prices are cheaper.

Clare
 McLeary, 30, of Shrewsbury, Salop, said this month she would risk 
prison so her nine-year-old son Riley Bryant could attend her wedding 
after his school refused to let him go.

A
 school in Cornwall recently backed down and let a woman take her 
grandchild, who was facing surgery, on holiday after the intervention of
 Parents Want A Say, which said Britain was ‘awash with furious 
families’.

Mr Haymore, who 
lives in Chelmsford, asked the school for an extension to their 
Christmas break so they could attend the memorial service of his wife 
Dana’s grandfather, who died last year.

He said the family had also recently suffered a crisis and wanted some extra time together.

Headmistress
 Claire Mills refused to allow Toby to go. But Mr Haymore told The 
Sunday Times: ‘We didn’t feel like this was a family holiday. This was 
an expat family going home for Christmas for the first time in four 
years to attend the last ever memorial service following the death of 
Dana’s grandfather. It would provide some relief to our family from the 
emotional strain we had been feeling.’

The family discovered they had been fined on their return. An appeal was turned down and they were issued with a summons.

They
 will challenge the ruling at Colchester Magistrates’ Court next month. 
Mr Hemming said: ‘There’s a question as to whether Michael Gove’s 
judgment about when children should always take holidays is better than a
 family’s judgment.’

The
 Department for Education said: ‘Children who attend school regularly 
are nearly four times more likely to achieve five or more good GCSEs 
than those who are regularly absent.’
