Todd Chrisley's son has sensationally claimed his father is gay, but is hiding the truth from his family.

The father-of-five's sexuality has long been the subject of speculation and several times he has been forced to publicly deny he is gay.

But his son, Kyle, 23, who is now estranged from him, says he believes the 46-year-old star of Chrisley Knows Best is lying.

Claims: Todd Chrisley's son Kyle, (left) has claimed his father is gay (right) and even said he suspects he is fooling around with a local doctor

Now you see him: Kyle was on the first season of Chrisley Knows best, but he's been kicked off the show

Kyle, who has well-documented problems with drugs, but claims he is now clean, told InTouch magazine: 'I think my father is gay.'

He said he suspects his father is fooling around with a local doctor - InTouch did not reveal their name. 

'I used to work with him at Chrisley Asset Management. 

Denial: His first wife Teresa Terry says she does not think her ex-husband is gay

'If one of the asset managers was going to take a p***, he would say, "You want me to come hold it for you?"

'It makes you wonder. It's time the truth comes out,' he said.

The 46-year-old's first wife, Teresa Terry, also recently addressed the claims in an interview with MailOnline. 

Smiling she admitted: 'I know there are reports saying that he's gay and I can see why. 

'But I married him and I had two children with him so obviously I don't think he's gay. 

'If he comes out of the closet in the second season I'll be shocked.'  

With his camp demeanor, acid tongue and relentlessly pristine appearance the self-styled Patriarch of Perfection's is constantly plagued by rumors of his sexuality.

He is married to wife Julie, 41, and has five children – Lindsie, 24, Kyle, 23, Chase,17, Savannah,16 and Grayson, 7.

But Kyle also has an explanation about why his father's second wife has stayed in the marriage for 18 years.

'If the money wasn't there, she would have been gone a long time ago,' he insisted.

Chrisley does make persistent references to the speculation in the hit show. 

'I'd rather be a gay pop icon than a redneck,' Chrisley said in an episode earlier this year. 

But only a few weeks ago Chrisley told InTouch: 'I am not gay, nor have I ever been.'

'I've never cared what others say about my sexuality,' he said.

'I'd much rather you think I'm getting laid versus not getting laid!' 

In an interview with People he spoke about when a man tweeted him asking 'When are you going to come out of the closet?'

'I said, "I don't live in a closet, but if you'd like me to escort you out of yours I'm happy to do so."

'All of a sudden the Tweet went away and he took it down because I flipped the script on him,' he said.

It is not the first time Kyle has verbally attacked his father - the pair are currently in a bitter custody battle over Kyle's two-year-old daughter Chloe.

Eye for detail: The father-of-five likes to organize all of his outfits 'by season'

In an exclusive interview with MailOnline last month, Kyle blasted Chrisley's 'fairy-tale' existence as a sham, dismissed the show as a fake and described his father as bankrupt, toxic and a snake.

'This show has been nothing but bad for me. 

'At this point he's ruined me and he's ruined the other three kids he's had who are spoiled,' he said.

Kyle said, 'The whole thing is fake. He micromanages everything so if you say something and he doesn't like it he'll say, 'Stop' and tell you what to say and you'll do it again.' 

Chrisley's rep told InTouch he is 'not concentrating on the words Kyle is saying, but rather concentrating on getting Kyle the necessary psychiatric care he so desperately needs.'
