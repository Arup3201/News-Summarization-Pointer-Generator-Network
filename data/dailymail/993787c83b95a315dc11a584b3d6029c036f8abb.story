Queensland born jihadist, Amira Karroum's body was found shot and her body dismembered in Syria.

Now Australian Federal Police have revealed that Ms Karroum is just one of a number of Australian women who have joined terrorist groups to fight in Syria.

The 22-year-old Australian and her husband Yusif Ali who traveled to Syria together to join the fight for Al-Qaeda affiliated group Jabhat al-Nusra.

Australian Federal Police’s counter terrorism manager Neil Gaughan told The Sunday Telegraph,  that Ms Karroum was involved in active conflict with her husband.

'That’s what we are alleging. That she was involved in the fighting with him,’' he said.It was originally believed that women were only supporting their husbands in the war zone but Ms Karroum's death proved otherwise as she was found armed.

'There’s a couple of women who have gone over as fighters — shooting guns — in Syria.

'They are young women. Under 21. One is dead. Amira Karroum.'

She was lined up against a wall and shot multiple times and then dismembered.

The couple was killed inside a house sprayed with bullets in Aleppo,near the border of Turkey.

Her father, Mohammed Karroum, said his daughter was 'beautiful', and liked barbecues and clubbing

She moved to Sydney after completing her degree in graphic design and that's when she met her husband, whose original name was Tyler Perry.

The idea that she was a terrorist in the making seemed farfetched for her friends and family.

It was her Facebook that gave away the changes she had made to her life and revealed she had been recruited to join Al-Qaeda.

'Islam is my identity. The burqa is my shield. Jannah (the Islamic garden of paradise) is my destination,' she wrote. She was preparing for something the was not equipped for when she landed on the firing line.

'Everything is temporary,' she posted on the social media site.

Mr Gaughan said the brutal deaths of 15 Australians in the region, including Karroum and her husband, underscored that the reality of war zone was different to the romanticised images online.'Once you go over there and you actually smell and taste it, it’s different,' he said.'Facebook and social media romanticise things. It’s just a totally different environment.’'

Her father, Mohamad Karroum suffered a mild heart attack when he was told of her death while her mother Honor Deane said she was 'distraught with grief'.

Mr Karroum told the ABC's 7.30  the details of her gruesome death.

'She got shot and then they dismantle her body.'

'They cut her body. I don’t know why they are so cruel. Her and her husband. There was a lot of bullet in her body. And they dismantled.'

Ms Karroum visited her father before departing to Syria, she had told him she was going to Denmark to do some humanitarian work.

'She came and saw me before she left, I didn't know she was leaving, and she hugged me and she started to cry,' Mr Karroum said.

Mr Karroum was devastated when he found out his daughter had been killed in Syria

'I knew it was different this time. I said to her, 'what’s wrong?', she said to me, 'nothing, I just love you Dad'.

'I accepted it - I didn’t know she was saying goodbye.'

Upon arriving in Syris Ms Karroum sent her father a chilling text message that should have been a warning sign.

'Please Dad, pray to Allah and ask him to forgive you for the days, for the years you have not prayed for him, death is around the corner Dad. I love you,' she wrote.

Ms Karroum and Mr Ali were executed only two days after her arrival in Syria.
