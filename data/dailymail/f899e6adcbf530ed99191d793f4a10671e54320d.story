Police are hunting a man seen biting and punching his dog in a busy city centre.

The man was seen abusing the brown and white Staffordshire bull terrier-type dog in Eastgate Street and Southgate Street, Gloucester, between 6pm and 6.30pm on Thursday.  

Officers were called to reports of the man abusing the animal between 6pm and 6.30pm.

A spokesman for Gloucestershire Police appealed for any witnesses to contact the force.

'Anyone who witnessed this abuse or has any further information please call 101 quoting incident number 371 of 4th December 2014,' the force spokesman said.

Earlier this year a man was found guilty of causing suffering to an animal after biting his girlfriend's dog after throwing it against a wall. 

Timothy Noonan was given a sentence of 26 weeks imprisonment suspended for two years after throwing a log at the boxer and biting on its cheek. 

A judge described his actions towards the animal and its owner, towards whom he had also behaved violently, as 'disgraceful'. 

Police are appealing to anyone who saw the incident on Eastgate Street, Gloucester, on Thursday
