A sea exploration company said today 
it has discovered yet another British wartime ship filled with silver, 
which is lying 8,000ft beneath the surface of the North Atlantic Ocean.

Odyssey
 Marine Exploration Inc hit the headlines earlier this month by 
discovering the Second World War-era SS Gairsoppa and its £155million 
haul of silver on the ocean floor.

Today
 the company proudly announced that it found the remains of the British 
SS Mantola, a First World War-era ship that sank on February 9, 1917.

Excellent condition: Despite being sent to the bottom in 1917, and suffering the ravages of salt water and pressure, the Mantola is literally in ship shape at the bottom of the Atlantic

Open the hatches: Odyssey Marine Exploration intends to return in the spring to mine both the Mantola and the Gairsoppa around 100 miles away

Like the Gairsoppa but decades before, the Mantola fell victim to a German submarine,  U-81.

An Odyssey spokesman said the Mantola was insured to carry silver worth £110,000 when it sailed in 1917.

That value would mean the ship could hold as much as 600,000 ounces of silver, based on silver prices in 1917. At current market prices, that much silver would be worth more than £12million.

Odyssey will retain 80 per cent of the value of the silver that's recovered.

Precious cargo: The SS Mantola, which was sunk by a German submarine in 1917 in the North Atlantic, carrying silver

The
 company is planning a recovery expedition next spring. It said its 
share of the proceeds will contribute significantly to funding its 
future operations.

The
 shipwreck is about 100 miles away from the SS Gairsoppa which sank in 1941 carrying a reported cargo of up 
to 7 million ounces of silver.

The Gairsoppa was steaming home from 
India while in the service of the Ministry of War Transport when
 she was torpedoed by a Nazi U-boat.

She sank in icy seas more than three miles deep about 300 miles south west of Ireland. Only one of her 84 crew survived.

Well preserved: A brass part of the Gairsoppa is in good condition, suggesting that the cargo is also undamaged by its time beneath the waves

In what is believed to be the deepest
 and largest ever retrieval of a precious cargo, the firm will next 
spring dive to recover a haul estimated to be worth £155million.

The 412-ft steamship is sitting upright on the seabed, with 
its holds open.

Odyssey said a robot submersible 
captured video footage showing tea chests, a sign that the heavier 
consignment of silver was underneath.

Hoard: The ship, which was torpedoed after breaking away from a convoy, was carrying silver

Uncovered: An intact toilet sits on the bridge deck of the SS Gairsoppa

Sunk: The SS Gairsoppa was a steel-hulled British cargo steamship that began her career in 1919 under the service of the British India Steam Navigation Company of London

Pick-up: Odyssey crew will use remotely operated vehicles to get to the wreck and unload its precious cargo

'This should enable us to unload the 
cargo through the hatches,’ chief executive Greg Stemm added. The 
Gairsoppa is so deep the usual steel cable used in the grab mechanisms 
will have to be replaced by synthetic fibres.

The ship, recognisable by the 
red-and-black paintwork of the British-India Steam Navigation Company 
and the torpedo hole in its side, was sailing in a convoy from Calcutta 
in 1941.

Buffeted by high winds and running 
low on coal, the captain decided he would not make it to Liverpool and 
broke from the convoy to head for Galway.

A single torpedo from U-101 sank her 
in 20 minutes, on February 17, 1941. Three lifeboats were launched, but 
only Second Officer Richard Ayres made it to land, reaching the Cornish 
coast after 13 days.

Odyssey said yesterday the UK 
government was ‘desperately looking for new sources of income’ and was 
urging it to find more British wrecks. It is also investigating HMS 
Sussex, lost off Gibraltar with 10 tons of gold in 1694, and HMS 
Victory, a precursor to Nelson’s flagship.

In 2008 a U.S. judge ordered the firm
 to hand back gold and silver coins worth £300million to Spain, which 
said the treasure was taken from a frigate that sank in 1804.

Odyssey said the wreck’s identity was unclear and had been found in international waters.
