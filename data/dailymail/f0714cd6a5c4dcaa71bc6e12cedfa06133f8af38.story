An Indiana town is battling to buy back a blind woman's home after an investor bought it for $43 at a tax auction - without her knowledge.

Dolores Pittman, 67, was stunned to learn that her home of 55 years in Cedar Lake had been snapped up by Clayton Pullins after the church that owned the land had failed to pay taxes on it.

Pullins wanted to charge her $300 a month for the rent - which she could not afford.

But this week, the Town Council unanimously voted to try to buy the land from Pullings so that Pittman, who lost her eyesight to a degenerative disease 30 years ago, does not have to move.

Now they are hoping that he accepts their offer to pay a fair market price, which would be determined by an independent appraiser. If not, they will use municipal condemnation powers to buy the land, council President Randell Niemeyer told the Chicago Tribune.

Ms Pittman, who has lived at the home since she was 12, was shocked when she received a letter from Pullins - unaware that the home had been bought or was even up for sale.

Her family had bought the 
house from a church that owned the property beneath and around the home, and initially paid $10 a month to the church to lease the land beneath their house.

But in the 1970s, Pittman was told the land had been sold to the town. In fact, the church still owned the little section of land and stopped paying taxes on it.

Due to these outstanding payments, the property went to a tax sale in 2009, where it was snapped up for the minimal amount by Pullins.

'For some reason 
nobody told this lady and or anybody else the land was on a tax sale, 
consequently the man who bought it only paid $43 for land,' John Petalas, the town treasurer, said.

If the town successfully buys it from Pullins, they will offer Pittman a 'life estate', which would allow her to live there for the rest of her life. After that, the land would be used by the surrounding park.

'Mrs. Pittman has lived there a long time, and this is an arrangement that, to me, serves the public interest, and a human interest,' Niemeyer said. 'She'll be able to stay there for the rest of her life.'

Pullins' attorney has not responded to requests for comment.

Pittman said that she was hopeful she 
would stay in the house - but she was packing up just in case, with the 
intention of moving to a rented house two miles away if she had to.

'That's
all I ever wanted in all this - to stay here the rest of my life, or 
until I had to go to a nursing home,' she told the Tribune, becoming 
emotional.

She had planned 
to pay for rent and utilities at her new home with donated money that 
people have donated as her plight received media coverage.

If she does get to stay, she said the money will go to much-needed renovations on the house.
