The tens of thousands of homes left without power over Christmas have all finally been reconnected five days after their electricity was cut off by violent storms.

Network bosses have admitted they failed to ensure enough engineers were working over the festive period to repair the damage and were today urged to cancel New Year holidays as more storms approach.

Households across the south east of England, north Wales and Cumbria have been without electricity over the last week because of damage caused by the storms.

At last: Engineers have restored power to the last of the tens of thousands of homes without electricity following the Christmas storms

It came as another storm of heavy rain and strong winds arrives in the UK, bringing with it a risk of flooding and disruption.

The executive of one of the UK's 
biggest power distributors has admitted its efforts to restore power to 
thousands of people should have been better.

Basil
 Scarsella, chief executive of the UK Power Networks, has admitted it 
was not prepared for the storm and too many staff were on holiday.

The
 company, which owns electricity lines and cables in London, the south 
east and east of England, said it will increase payments for 48 to 
60-hour outages from £27 to £75 for those affected on Christmas Day as 
'a gesture of goodwill'.

Additional
 payments will be made to customers who have been without electricity 
for longer than that time - up to a maximum of £432.

Mr Scarsella said: 'We could not have avoided the damage caused by the storm but we could have responded to it better.

'A
 lot of our employees had gone away for holidays so it meant we had a 
level of depletion in our resources - and that caused problems with 
getting people's power restored.

'It's
 difficult to justify saying the company has performed well when 
customers have been without power for five days, but once we had an idea
 of how bad it was we were able to mobilise as many engineers and office
 staff as possible.'

Forecasters have said the latest storm pushing in from the Atlantic will cross the UK from west to east today.

The Met Office has issued a severe weather warning over fears of strong gales of up to 80mph affecting Wales, southern, western and northern England and Scotland.

It has also warned of the danger of ice patches in the south west tonight as temperatures drop to below freezing.

George Goodfellow, a forecaster for MeteoGroup, said: 'Normally, we would say this is a typical winter storm but because we're still recovering from a string of other storms it is likely to cause more disruption and flooding.'

He said the south west will continue to bear the brunt of the storm.

More bad news: The Met Office has issued a severe weather warning over fears of strong gales of up to 80mph affecting Wales, southern, western and northern England and Scotland today with more storms through the week

The Environment Agency (EA) have around 100 flood alerts in place in southern, western and northern England.

Britain is braced for an entire month of bad weather that could see the number of homes flooded more than double.

As the big clean-up gets under way in the aftermath of the Christmas storms, persistent rain will sweep across the country today and return to drench New Year’s Eve revellers.

Then from New Year’s Day, storms and rain can be expected for the foreseeable future, forecasters warn. ‘There is no end in sight,’ said a Met Office spokesman.

The fresh wave of bad weather could see the figure for flooded homes double to more than 2,000 in the worst hit areas of Kent, Surrey and Sussex.

The agency said persistent rainfall means there is a ‘continued  heightened flood risk’ across southern England, particularly South-West England. Some 70 flood alerts and five more serious flood warnings remain in place across the country.

One warning is in place for Tewkesbury where the ground is still saturated after the Christmas rain. Much of the Gloucestershire town was submerged after the Avon and Severn rivers burst their banks last week.

A spokesman for the Met Office said: ‘For as far as we can see, the wet and windy weather is here to stay. There is no end in sight.

'We are in the middle of winter, so this weather is not unusual, but there is no sign of it settling down as we go into January.’

Six people have died during the bad weather, while the bill for insurance companies is likely to top £100million.

And the unsettled weather looks set to continue into the new year after the Met Office issued a severe weather warning for rain on New Year's Day, affecting southern England and western Scotland.

Some 1,300 properties have been flooded during the recent storms in England, the EA said.

Meanwhile energy companies have been criticised for their slow reaction to storm damage.

Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said he has pressed energy companies to stop staff taking new year holidays as a second week of storms looks set to derail the festive period.

Speaking on ITV's Daybreak programme, he said: 'I think some of them (energy companies) definitely let their customers down, and I'm pleased to hear they are going to pay some compensation to those who are out of power.

'We were told yesterday that the final 130 houses (without power) would all be back on by last night and I'll have my daily meeting at nine when I hope to hear that has been achieved.

'Some of the companies have performed, some have not, and I think they have been penalised by the reaction of their customers. It's up to them to compensate their customers.

'We've had two Cobra (the Government's emergency committee) meetings over the last couple of days and we've made it very clear that we expect them to take proper measures - not to let staff go away on holiday over the new year period and to be properly prepared for this week.'

Mr Paterson added that emergency financial assistance - known as the Bellwin fund - could be made available to local authorities to ensure flood defences and power supplies remain intact.

'It's dreadful for all those involved but we do give credit to those in the Environment Agency who worked throughout that period and who are working as we speak now,' he said.

'We've had Cobra meetings co-ordinating the other Government departments, and local government has been told at every level that they must make sure they have adequate staff on over the new year period.

'We've also said the 'Bellwin' can be triggered, which is an emergency fund where central government can come in and help.'
