A theme park has banned adults unaccompanied by children from entry over fears that they could be paedophiles.

The bizarre rule at Puxton Park, in Somerset, came to light after a bird enthusiast was forbidden from watching a falconry display at the centre on his own.

Matthew Richards, 54, had visited with his three grandchildren just days earlier and wanted to return for another look at the birds of prey area - but was turned away.

The centre has appeared to contradict itself in justifying the rule - first claiming it has been in place for seven years - before then blaming it on last year's visit from jailed paedophile Phillip Judd - the former mayor of Weston-super-Mare. 

Turned away: Father-of-three Matthew Richards, 54, was banned from entering Puxton Park on his own

Father-of-three Mr Richards was turned away at the theme park's gate on Thursday with staff telling him they did not admit single men and women on child protection grounds.

When he complained, bosses at the tourist attraction near Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, defended the bizarre rule and insisted it is 'in line with other parks' - before sanding him away.

The married father-of-three said: 'I almost feel discriminated against. I could understand it if it was for the attractions that young children only enjoy, but the falconry is of interest to all.

'I was frankly amazed. I was told the rule applies to single men, and women, for the protection of children.

'I couldn't see anything about the rule on the brochure which I picked up at another attraction.

'We have taken one of our grandchildren there before, and I saw that the falconry was there and thought it would be interesting to go back and see the displays.

'They are advertising adult memberships as gifts so I can't understand it.'

The park's managing director, Alistair Mead, has claimed the centre was 'forced to implement stringent child protection policies' because of 'the society in which we live in'.

He then alluded to the case of Phillip Judd, the former mayor of Weston-super-Mare who visited the theme park before being jailed for child pornography offences last month.  

Speaking to the BBC, he said: 'If you cannot trust civic authority figures then, simply, who can you trust?

Attraction: Matthew Richards was hoping to see a falconry display at the leisure centre in Somerset

'Mr Judd had visited Puxton Park to undertake a civic duty and his sinister secrets were only recently exposed and he was jailed for his crimes.'

The reason appears to contradict the theme park's earlier claim that the rule had existed for seven years. 

Mr Mead added: 'We would rather be over zealous when unaccompanied adults visit us armed with cameras than put children at any potential risk.' 

The award-winning Puxton Park is a family-orientated leisure attraction which includes zip lines, a play barn, crazy golf and animal enclosures, as well as an owl zone and a falconry centre.

Mr Richards from High Littleton, near Bath, Somerset, had attended the park with his family, and returned on Thursday only intending to watch another falconry display.

But he was banned from entering by staff who claimed their rule was clearly explained on the website.

The bird enthusiast had visited the centre just days earlier with his grandchildren (file picture) 

The 'prices' section online states: 'We are sorry but we are unable to let single men or women without children into the park.

'If you are here to meet someone let one of our reception staff know and they will happily do a tannoy announcement asking them to come and meet you.'

Alistair Mead earlier commented: 'There is a lot in the headlines about paedophiles and things that are going on with children.

'We have done our research and in line with all other parks we don't let single men or women in.

'We make it quite clear that if people want to go to the falconry they have to get a prior appointment, and we would take them down to the falconry centre.

'It is in the leaflet. I think if I did a survey of 100 of our customers they would agree that we are doing the right thing.'

A new statement on the leisure centre's website reads: 'Our members fully support our decisions and we have received nothing but praise for our policy including positive feedback from a Child Protection Specialist, who commended us for our child protection principals.

'Within seven years we have only had one complaint about this policy from the gentlemen last week.

'At the time of setting the policy the other parks within the area had a similar stance to us. I have spoken to two or three similar client based parks this morning and they still have the same policy as we do. I'm not going to name names as it's unprofessional of me to do so.

'In light of this coverage we will look at what other parks are doing with their admissions policy, speak to our customers and review.'

A spokesman for Visit Somerset said: 'It sounds as if Puxton Park needs to publicise this particular rule a bit more prominently.'
