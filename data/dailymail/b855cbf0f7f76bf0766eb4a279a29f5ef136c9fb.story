Russia's food safety watchdog will conduct checks on McDonald's restaurants in the Urals region in response to complaints, a day after four branches of the chain were shuttered in Moscow.

Natalya Lukyantseva, an official in the Sverdlovsk regional office of the agency, told RIA Novosti and Interfax that unplanned checks were being carried out in a number of restaurants after residents voiced safety concerns. 

The inspections come one day after the agency, known in Russia as Rospotrebnadzor, ordered four Moscow-based restaurants to suspend operations, citing 'numerous' sanitary law violations.

One of those restaurants, on Moscow's central Pushkin Square, was the first to open in the Soviet Union in 1990, drawing crowds of thousands that circled around the block. 

The restaurant became a symbol of domestic reform and openness with the West, and today it is one of the company's most visited venues in Russia.

The shutdown comes in the wake of rising tensions between Russia and the West. 

After the U.S. and the European Union slapped sanctions on a range of Russian banks and crucial industries last month in reaction to Vladimir Putin's annexation of Crimea, Russia responded with a wide-ranging ban on food products imported from those regions.

McDonald's could not be immediately reached for comment about the checks in the Sverdlovsk region, but a statement posted on the Russian version of its website Wednesday said the company was doing 'all it can for a speedy opening' of the four Moscow restaurants.

On Wednesday evening, the lights were off inside the popular Pushkin Square McDonald’s restaurant - which is usually crammed with diners - and a sign on the door said it was shut ‘for technical reasons.’

It was hugely popular with Russians; long lines formed outside and some people even had their wedding receptions there.

Another of the restaurants closed on the orders of the food safety watchdog is on Moscow's Manezh square, under the walls of the Kremlin where President Putin has his offices.

The state food safety watchdog said in a statement inspectors had found numerous sanitary violations. A source at the watchdog said it had sealed off parts of the restaurant premises.

Some Russian consumers, however, are not lovin' their government’s crackdown against McDonald's.

Dmitry Boiko, 46, who has been a loyal patron of the fast-food chain since the 1990s, was outraged to see the historic Pushkin Square location closed down when he went to get a Filet-O-Fish on his lunch break Wednesday.

'Personally I'm against them closing McDonald's,’ Boiko told Radio Free Europe Liberty Radio. ‘This was the first McDonald's. You could put a memorial to it here!’

Another loyal customer, a 62-year-old Muscovite named Nikolai, told the radio station that the fast food joint is one of the only places offering cheap eats in Moscow's central square lined with tony restaurants and boutiques.

It became clear last month that McDonald's was under heightened scrutiny from the Russian state, when Rospotrebnazor said it had identified violations in product quality that raised questions about the safety of food across the chain.

The agency filed a lawsuit against McDonald's, accusing the Novgorod branch of understating the caloric value of burgers and milkshakes by 50 per cent and serving food contaminated with e. coli bacteria. 

Foreign food producers who have fallen foul of the watchdog in the past have accused it of acting in the political interests of the Kremlin, an allegation it denies.

The watchdog banned Georgian wine as Tbilisi strengthened ties with Washington and spirits from Moldova after the former Soviet republic boosted its drive to partner with the European Union.

Earlier this month Russia banned all meat, fish, dairy, fruit and vegetable imports from the United States, the European Union, Norway, Canada, and Australia for one year in retaliation for the sanctions imposed by these countries over Ukraine.

Defiant: Despite the closures, McDonald's plans to open new branches in Siberia by year's end 

However, some of these restrictions were eased Wednesday to allow the import of some items that are useful to its own food and agriculture industries, such as vegetables for planting and hatchlings of salmon and trout.

McDonald's operates 438 restaurants in Russia and sees the country as one of its top seven major markets outside the United States and Canada, according to its 2013 annual report.

On Thursday, Russia's wire service ITAR-TASS reported that despite the branch closures this week, McDonald's will go forward with its expansion plan in Siberia.

The American fast-food giant intends to open three new outlets in Novosibirsk and four eateries in Omsk by year's end.
