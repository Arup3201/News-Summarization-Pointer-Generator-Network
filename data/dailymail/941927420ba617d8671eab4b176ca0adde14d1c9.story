A two-year-old girl’s entire shoulder was left burned and blistered after she suffered a severe allergic reaction to a plaster that claims to promote skin healing.

Doctors say Jayda Johnson could be scarred for life after wearing the Savlon plaster for just one day.

Her family have complained to the plaster’s manufacturers as her shoulder now looks ‘disgusting’ from just one tiny cut.

Jayda had a tiny graze on her shoulder after cutting herself on the sofa.

Her father Daniel put a plaster from a £3.99 pack of Savlon dressings on her shoulder to stop her from scratching the wound.

Jayda Johnson, two, suffered a severe allergic reaction after wearing a plaster from a pack of £3.99 Savlon Hydrocolloid Dressings. Doctors say  she may be scarred for life after wearing the plaster for just one day

Jayda's father put the plaster on his daughter on a Sunday morning after she  cut herself on the sofa. He checked the plaster on Monday morning and found it had burned through his daughter's skin (left). Her whole shoulder and part of her back became inflamed due to the allergic reaction (right)

A doctor said the reaction could scar Jayda for life. She has been told to return to see a nurse every two days to get her dressing changed and is on a course of antibiotics after the wound became infected (pictured)

The instructions advised leaving it on for up to a week.

But when Mr Johnson checked the cut the next day, he was horrified to find the plaster had burned through his daughter's skin.

The plaster was only 7.5cm long by 5cm wide, but Jayda’s entire right shoulder and part of her back had become inflamed.

Doctors said Jayda had suffered a severe allergic reaction to the dressing, and could be scarred for life from it.

The packaging for the Savlon Hydrocolloid Dressing says the plasters 'help prevent scarring' and 'promote faster healing'. 

Hydrocolloid plasters and dressings are said to absorb moisture from the wound but at the same time create a protective barrier so that oxygen, water and bacteria cannot get into the wound.

This creates a moist, humid environment which promotes faster healing, and prevents scarring as a hard scab doesn't form. 

The Savlon plasters also claim to be hypoallegenic - which means the product is claimed to cause fewer allergic reactions.

Mr Johnson, a father-of-two, from Harlow, Essex, said: 'It's not good. It's definitely affected her, she's fully aware of it and it looks terrible, to be honest.

'She had a little nick from the edge of the sofa so I put a plaster over it.

'I applied it on Sunday morning and then when I took it off on Monday when she got home from nursery I noticed it had burned her massively.

'It seemed to be burning into her skin. The packet said to leave it on for four to seven days.

'I'm terrified that if I had left it on for the full seven days it would've burned down to the bone.'

Mr Johnson, 31, noticed the burn on January 26 and took Jayda to see a doctor the following morning while his wife Lisa, 29, was at her telesales job.

Mr Johnson, a coach driver, added: 'The doctor said it must have been an allergic reaction to the patch.

'It looks awful, like a second degree burn.

'She doesn't seem to be in too much pain from it, which makes me worry her nerves may have been damaged.'

There have been reports of people suffering allergic reactions to hydrocolloid wound dressings .

One report found the allergic reaction was caused by an ingredient called  'pentaerythritol ester of hydrogenated rosin' as a tackifying agent, to make the plaster sticky - though it is not known if this ingredient caused Jayda's reaction. 

Jayda has now been told to return to see a nurse every two days to get her dressing changed and is on a course of antibiotics after the wound became infected.

Her grandmother Margaret Johnson said: 'She's only two and it's going to scar her.

'The doctor said it could scar her for life and it was only for a nick on the shoulder.

'It looks like it is spreading. I'm very concerned for her.

'If it had been on her face it could have been 20 million times worse - she has never had any sort of skin reaction before.

Jayda's father Daniel Johnson, 31, said she had what looked like a second degree burn after just one day. He said: 'I'm terrified that if I had left it on for the full seven days it would've burned down to the bone'

'For all we know she might be a model when she's older.

'She's a stunning little girl but this is disgusting.'

The family have written to Savlon owners Novartis Consumer Health to complain about the product.

A company spokesman said: 'Novartis Consumer Health (NCH) is aware of a recent case concerning a patient who has experienced a skin reaction on the application site of Savlon Hydrocolloid dressing.

'Patient safety is our highest priority. 

'As with any NCH products, we monitor carefully any adverse reports received and forward them to Health Authorities according to local legislation. 

'NCH is investigating this report in line with regulatory requirements.'
