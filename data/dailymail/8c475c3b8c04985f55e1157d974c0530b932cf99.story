Meet Tyrone Welcome - the goalkeeper out to prove that having one arm is no barrier to being a safe pair of hands between the sticks.

Tyrone admits that opposition forwards regularly underestimate him.

But they are often left frustrated by his shot-stopping prowess - and has saved three of his last five penalties.

One-armed wonder: Tyrone Welcome regularly surprises his opposition with his shot-stopping prowess despite his disability

At full stretch: Tyrone has saved three penalties out of his last five for his team, Aston Stars FC

Tyrone, 38, said: 'Once the other team have seen me make a few stops they soon realise I’m hard to beat.

'Because I’ve had to focus so hard on my game, my mind is always one step ahead - I think my anticipation is twice what it would have been otherwise.

'It’s a bit of reverse psychology. I know they’ll naturally try and stick it down my right hand side, so I edge even closer to the left to encourage them to hit it that way.

'Once they’ve fallen for it I throw my weight the other way and save it. It works like a dream.'

When it comes to catching the ball, Tyrone says he normally opts to punch it safety.

'With practice you get very good at anticipating the flight of the ball and getting some real distance on it,' he added.

'I take real pride in a clean sheet and every time I play I aim to keep one. I have a mixed record, but over the years I’ve got my fair share.'

Inspirational Tyrone, who plays for Aston Stars FC in the Birmingham Southern League, lost his right arm aged 12 after being electrocuted when copper wire he was carrying touched an overhead power cable.

He initially packed in sport altogether but now he’s barely off the pitch - not only holding down the No1 shirt for his Sunday side, but also for Great Britain’s official amputee national side.

He said: 'I’ve wanted to test myself in proper match situations for a while now so when Aston Stars came calling it was the perfect opportunity for me.

'I initially got the call-up to the national team nine years ago from a GB amputee player. I wasn’t going to go as I regard myself as able-bodied, but I went and I loved every minute.

'To pull on the jersey and belt out the national anthem in front of thousands of people is beyond a dream - I get a tear in my eye when I’m out there.'

The FA currently offers no financial support meaning the only way Tyrone and his national teammates can compete in tournaments is through self-funding.

Last year, the GB Amputee Team were left as the only self-funded team at the World Cup in Argentina. Even countries like Sierra Leone were fully sponsored.

They have set up their own charity, England Amputee Football Association, and are looking for sponsors. If you can help, visit www.theeafa.co.uk.
