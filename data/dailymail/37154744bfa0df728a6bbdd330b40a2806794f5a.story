Sending your family Christmas card to more than half a million people may sound impossible, but that is exactly what one family have managed to achieve.

Bored with the ordinary paper Christmas greeting, the family decided to record and release a rap video of them in their Christmas pyjamas.

The clip, which has been posted on YouTube, has now been viewed more than 500,000 in less than a week.

Penn Holderness, his wife, Kim, and their children Lola, six, and Penn Charles, four, have told friends to consider the video their ‘annual newsletter’.

Performing the song in matching pyjamas – with different labels for each family member – the family, from Raleigh, North Carolina, even started their own hashtag on Twitter, #xmasjammies.

They make several personal revelations in the video, including the fact that Penn has had a vasectomy, so the family will not be having a third child.

In a series of personal revelations, the Holderness family also announce father Penn has had a vasectomy

He has also given up his job as a news anchor on WNCN. His wife raps: ‘It’s the biggest decision of his life, he’s going to quit his job and come work with his wife.’

The family also reveal that he has had a vasectomy and boast about a small role he played in Iron Man Three.

The video also updates friends, family and internet viewers on the children. While Lola won a triathlon this year, Penn Charles is taking a hip-hop class.

Wife Kim raps: 'It's the biggest decision of his life, he¿s going to quit his job and come work with his wife'

Kim said: 'I think it's a pretty honest look and a pretty ridiculous look into the craziness of a modern family.'

Kim, meanwhile, has interviewed several celebrities as part of her job and also competed in a running race.

Mother Kim told ABCNews.com: ‘I think it's a pretty honest look and a pretty ridiculous look into the craziness of a modern family.’

Explaining that the family do not take themselves ‘too seriously’, she added: ‘We're acting like fools and I'm guessing people like to see other people making fools of themselves.’

The family use the end of the video to promote their new video-making business.

Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, left, allowed his children to design his Christmas card on an iPad this year

This quirky family weren’t the only ones to release a Christmas video this year.

Last week, West Yorkshire Police released a version of Silent Night – with the opening lyrics ‘Silent night, crimes to fight’ – as their annual greeting.

Several traditional paper cards also caused a stir this year.

Naturally, the Kardashians annual card raised a few eyebrows when Bruce Jenner was featured in it inside a glass tube.

Elsewhere, Kelly Clarkson this year tweeted a bizarre Christmas card photo on Twitter with her family wrapped in decorations while gazing sideways at Father Christmas.

In UK politics, Nick Clegg allowed his children to design his Christmas card with his wife, Miriam, on an iPad.

As a result, he ended up with a Santa hat on, while his wife was sporting some reindeer ears and Rudolph’s red nose.

Outspoken Ukip MEP Godfrey Bloom, meanwhile, posed for a self-mocking Christmas card in which he is holding bongos while his wife does her best impression of a ‘slut’.
