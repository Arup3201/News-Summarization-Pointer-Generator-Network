Swansea City are wrapping up a £1.5million deal for Ostersund FK forward Modou Barrow.

The Swedish club have announced 21-year-old Barrow will move to Swansea this week.

Barrow had been training with Bolton and was a target for Celtic and Hull. He will travel on Thursday to Wales for his medical ahead of signing terms with the Swans.

Born in Gambia, Barrow's career so far has only been with Swedish clubs. 

Among them are Mjolby Sodra IF, Mjolby Sodra IF, IFK Norrkoping, Varbergs BoIS FC and Ostersunds FK.

'It is a great achievement for Modou and of course for our entire club that a player goes to a team in the world's best soccer league, the Premier League. It is sensational,' said OFK chairman Daniel Kindberg.

'There are many who speculate about how much this deal is worth to OFK. 

'We will not comment on any of the content of the deal. It's part of the business agreement.'

Nearly there: Swansea will soon have the help of Barrow up top as they get their new season underway

Saved: Burnley goalkeeper Tom Heaton makes a stop but Swansea kept going to win 1-0 in the Premier League
