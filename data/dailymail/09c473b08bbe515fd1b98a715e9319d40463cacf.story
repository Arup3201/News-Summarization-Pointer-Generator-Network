Leeds United became the latest club to pay for grappling in the penalty area when Guiseppe Bellusci foolishly conceded a crucial late spot-kick at Elland Road.

Bellusci grabbed Charlton defender Tal Ben Haim and pulled him to the floor to stop him reaching a Johnnie Jackson corner.

And when his indiscretion was spotted by referee Graham Salisbury, Johann Gudmundsson scored an 81st minute equaliser from the resulting penalty.

It cost Leeds United the chance of recording their first win in eight games and manager Neil Redfearn cut a frustrated figure after his first match at Elland Road since being made the club's permanent manager.

'I thought it was a really harsh decision. What I would say is that referees have to be more consistent,' he said of the penalty award.

'There are a thousand incidents like that and to isolate one looks unfair. I have seen it again briefly and it looked like they were both at it.

'The same thing happened in the Charlton penalty area and if you give them all, the game will end up seven-all.'

Bellusci has already collected one red card and five yellows since signing from Italian club Catania in August and his late intervention did spoil Redfearn's big night as the proper boss after four spells as caretaker.

Twice, 19-year-old Alex Mowatt had given Leeds the lead with terrific long-range strikes, a fitting goalscorer as he was one of the youngsters developed by Redfearn at the club's academy.

But it is a sign of Massimo Cellino's Leeds at the moment that every forward step is met quickly with a backward one.

No sooner had Mowatt put Leeds ahead early in the second half than goalkeeper Marco Silvestri allowed Gudmundsson's shot to go through his legs at the near post.

Then when Mowatt repeated his magic to score from 25 yards, another of Cellino's Italian imports showed indiscipline at a time when officials are looking out for shirt-pulling following the Mail's Hands off in the Box campaign.

Cellino, who has sacked three managers since buying Leeds in April, was at Elland Road to see his latest appointment take charge.

Charlton manager Bob Peeters said: '2-1 for us was more justified than 2-1 to them. But you can't do anything when a player (Mowatt) has a shot like that from 25 yards, you can only applaud.

'I didn't see the penalty at the end because I was looking at one of my player Rhoys Wiggins who had an injury. But we deserved a result.' Charlton have drawn nine of their 16 Championship games.

Redfearn will have to pick his side up again. 'We are a wounded animal. I am dragging them back into the world,' he said. 'I want better than OK. I am not going to let them rest.'
