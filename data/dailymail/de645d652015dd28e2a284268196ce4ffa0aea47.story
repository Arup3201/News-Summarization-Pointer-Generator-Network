Payout: Natalie Creane was awarded just £36,000 by an Abu Dhabi court after a freak accident in a luxury hotel left her with permanent brain damage

A British bride left brain-damaged 
after a wooden panel fell on her head in a seven-star hotel in Abu Dhabi
has been awarded just £36,000 in compensation.

Natalie Creane's four-and-a-half year 
battle for justice after she was injured at the Emirates Palace hotel 
ended in Abu Dhabi Higher Claims Civil Court today.

But the compensation package, which 
will be split between the hotel, its managers Kempinski and its insurers
Abu Dhabi National Insurance Company, is a fraction of the £3.5 million
claim she lodged to cover the impact on her life.

The 34-year-old walks and talks with 
difficulty and cannot be left alone after the incident at the hotel left
her with epileptic seizures and a traumatic brain injury.

She has been in a medically-induced 
coma five times and been admitted to intensive care more than 20 times. 
Doctors have warned her next seizure could be her last.

Mrs Creane from South Weald, Essex, 
had booked a stay at the Emirates Palace in July 2008 to celebrate her 
engagement to Trevor, 42.

While he was out of the room a 2.2kg wooden panel, which was not fixed properly to the top of the wardrobe, fell on her head.

She was found unconscious on the floor
by a room attendant but staff failed to call an ambulance and instead 
she was driven to hospital in one of the hotel's chauffeur driven cars.

Mrs Creane's health deteriorated soon 
after the incident and after a lengthy battle to get the hotel to admit 
responsibility, she launched her civil action in September 2011.

She has previously said: 'I do not 
live a normal life and I never will. I lost my career, my quality of 
life, my independence and my peace of mind. My body feels like it should
be on someone far beyond my years and our entire family is traumatised 
beyond belief.'

Her wedding in the summer of 2009 had 
to be postponed three times because of her ill health while the former 
human resources director had to be held up by three people to try on her
wedding dress and used extensions to cover bald patches where 
medication had caused her hair to fall out.

She said: 'I was too weak to stand and
had so much pain in my hands and arms from all the canulas and needles 
as I had just been discharged from hospital.'

The hotel refuted her claims and used 
pictures of her wedding from her Facebook page in court to show she was 
living a normal life.

But Mrs Creane, who was in court to hear the verdict, said her family life had been devastated by her condition.

She has previously said on a Facebook 
campaign page called Justice for Natalie, which has attracted more than 
20,000 followers: 'Every normal thing they try and use against me that I
have been able to do since the accident has taken so much strength and 
determination and has not been normal at all. It has been under so many 
medications and so much pain and trauma.'

Her family now fear for her future. 
She is on constant medication and spent months in the UK being seen by a
string of consultants to no avail.

A statement on the Facebook page at 
the time read: 'Neurologists feel as she has not responded to 
medications in the past…the likelihood of her ever responding is almost 
non-existent.'

Mrs Creane's family are keen to send 
her to a specialist unit in the United States but with an initial 
assessment and tests costing nearly £70,000, the treatment is beyond 
their means. Her mother Angie - who once had to rescue her from drowning
in the bath during a seizure - together with her father Derrick have 
given up work and ploughed their savings into funding her treatment.

They now care for Mrs Creane at her home in Dubai.

Natalie Creane had just got engaged to husband 
Trevor and was celebrating in Abu Dhabi when the piece of wood fell on 
her in 2008

The three defendants were told half 
the compensation was to cover Mrs Creane's physical injuries while the 
remaining £18,000 covered her emotional distress. The court did not 
order payment of her medical expenses as she had not submitted receipts.

A spokeswoman from Kempinski hotels 
said: 'We will study carefully with our legal team the full written 
judgment once we receive it in the coming days.'

Mrs Creane's family said they planned to appeal the verdict as it was a fraction of the compensation they had been hoping for.

They said in a statement on her 
Facebook campaign page: 'We are delighted Abu Dhabi Court of First 
Instance recognised the fault of the defendants and found in favour of 
Natalie.

'Finally after an almost five-year 
struggle, acknowledgment that their negligence caused the accident and 
subsequently her injuries.

'The process is still ongoing and 
subject to appeal as the award does not begin to reflect what is needed 
for her future care nor the last five years of unbearable pain, 
suffering and horrendous medical bills.

'We will continue in our fight to ensure justice is served fully.'
