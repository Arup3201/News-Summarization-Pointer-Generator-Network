Liverpool’s bid to sign Alberto Moreno from Sevilla for £16.2million hangs in the balance after the Spanish club demanded a large chunk of the fee up front.

Anfield boss Brendan Rodgers hopes to make the left back his third signing of the summer and the 21-year-old was due to fly to Liverpool with his father and agent on Monday.

But Sevilla have put the deal at risk of collapsing over the structure of payments. The La Liga club also want guaranteed add-ons to the initial fee.

The move could also hinge on whether Ivan Rakitic joins Barcelona as Sevilla need to raise money from transfers this summer.

Moreno
 was at the wedding of Liverpool’s Luis Alberto on Saturday, according 
to Spanish newspaper Estadio Deportivo, where he heard good reports 
about the Anfield dressing room.

Liverpool
 midfielder Suso, who was initially proposed as part of the deal for 
Moreno, may now move to Portuguese side Porto, who have expressed an 
interest.

The 20-year-old has one year left on contract and Porto are keen to secure a quick deal.

Liverpool
 also plan talks with Iago Aspas, whose agent has stated he wants to 
stay but they will sell if he is unhappy at being a back-up striker.
