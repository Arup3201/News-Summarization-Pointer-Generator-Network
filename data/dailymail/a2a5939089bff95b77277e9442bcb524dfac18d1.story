A former Fortune 500 executive is facing a wrongful death lawsuit for fatally crashing into a pregnant woman, her fiance and their fetus in what New Hampshire authorities called a failed suicide attempt.

The estate of 24-year-old Amanda Murphy sued Robert Dellinger February 20, the day after he pleaded guilty to negligent homicide in the deaths of Murphy and Jason Timmons, 29, of Wilder, Vermont. 

Dellinger also pleaded guilty to assault for the death of their unborn baby. Murphy was eight months pregnant at the time of the crash. 

Sued: Former Fortune 500 executive Robert Dellinger, 54, was hit with a wrongful death lawsuit last month, a day after he pleaded guilty to negligent homicide in the deaths of a young couple 

Tragic: John Timmons, 29, and Amanda Murphy, 24, were killed instantly in the crash on December 7, 2013

The lawsuit, which lists five counts, seeks damages for Dellinger's 'wanton, reckless and grossly negligent' conduct, according to The Valley News. 

Investigators say Dellinger was trying to kill himself when he drove through the median of Interstate 89 in December 2013.

The lawsuit was filed by Murphy's mother, Tammy Langlois, who oversees her daughter's estate. Timmons mother, Deborah Blanchard, is also expected to sue Dellinger.  

Dellinger has not been served with the suit yet. Dellinger's lawyer said he was not attempting to end his life, but rather suffering from delirium due to a 'toxic regime' of medications. 

Dellinger, 54, of Sunapee, New Hampshire, was initially charged with manslaughter, but that was later upgraded to second-degree murder. 

'I’m extremely remorseful to the families, and to my own family, as well. I wish I could have that day over,' Dellinger said in court.

Negligent homicide is a lesser charge. Dellinger will be sentenced in April. He could face 12 to 24 years in prison.

Dellinger's attorneys claimed that the former high-powered executive was suffering from Ambien withdrawal, the effects of a psychiatric drug overdose and Prozac, and the advanced symptoms of multiple sclerosis 

Dellinger, who held high-level posts at PPG Industries Inc., Sprint Corp., Delphi Corp. and General Electric Co., told investigators he was trying to kill himself on December 7, 2013, when he steered his pickup across a highway median in Lebanon, New Hampshire.  

His truck became airborne and sheared the top off of the victims' SUV, causing injuries so severe that the medical examiner said the couple looked like they had been in a plane crash.

The Vermont couple, who had met while working at a home for the elderly, were killed instantly.

Dellinger, who suffered cuts on his head and face, was initially charged with two counts of reckless manslaughter.

Miss Murphy, 24, was excited to be a mother for the first time, and the couple had already named their unborn baby girl Reagan Elizabeth.

A week before the crash, the residential center where the couple worked together hosted a baby shower for them.

Catherine Amarante, executive director at the facility, described the couple as 'very loving'.

Arraignment: Robert J. Dellinger, was is arraigned by video at Lebanon District Court in Lebanon, New Hampshire, on December 11, 2013, a few days after the crash

Excited: Amanda Murphy and Jason Timmons, pictured with one of his three children from a previous relationship, were looking forward to the arrival of their baby girl

Mr Timmons, 29, was also a father to three children from a previous relationship. 

According to prosecution, the former executive had argued with his wife over his 
medications on the morning of the crash, WMUR reported.

'He was driving around, depressed and loopy,' senior assistant attorney general for New Hampshire Susan Morrell said. 'He saw the median and decided to turn into it.' 

Dellinger's lawyer, R. Peter Decato, 
however called the state's comments 'over the top' and said Dellinger had led a 
'productive and exemplary life.'

The married father had served as senior vice president and chief financial officer at Fortune 500 company PPG Industries Inc.

He
 took a severance package worth more than $1million in cash plus stocks
 when he left in 2011 because of health reasons, according to documents 
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Records show that a Dellinger family trust owns four property in the town of Sunapee worth $3million in total.
