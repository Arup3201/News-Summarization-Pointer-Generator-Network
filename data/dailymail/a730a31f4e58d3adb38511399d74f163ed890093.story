Retired special needs teacher William Gouldburn died after waiting two hours for an ambulance, despite his family making seven 999 calls

A pensioner died after an agonising two-hour wait on his bathroom floor for an ambulance.

William Gouldburn, 73, collapsed at home but was not regarded a ‘red’ emergency despite seven desperate  999 calls.

By the time a rapid-response team arrived the retired teacher had gone into cardiac arrest and it was too late to save him, an inquest heard.

Incredibly, the first crew to turn up at his Hartlepool home were from the charity first aid service St John Ambulance – who were replaced once the seriousness of the situation emerged.

Ambulance bosses say they lacked the resources to meet demand that night and were hit by delays caused by a lack of  hospital beds.

A coroner has ruled that Mr Gouldburn might have been saved if medics had reached him sooner, branding the tragedy a ‘sad consequence’ of a lack  of ambulances.

Saying his death was aggravated by a ‘lack of timely and appropriate medical intervention’, Hartlepool coroner Malcolm Donnelly added: ‘Had there been more ambulances available the outcome might have  been different.

‘It would appear to be a consequence of stretched resources, perhaps doing the best they can, but people are not receiving the service they might feel entitled to occasionally.

‘My concern is the time it takes for deployment and when [an ambulance] does attend it is manned by a charity.’

On the day of the tragedy last April, Mr Gouldburn, who was recovering from shoulder surgery, told his wife Pamela, 70, he was feeling unwell.

A doctor who visited failed to find a serious problem, but offered to send him to hospital – which he refused. He collapsed at around 10.20am, when his carer called 999, telling call handlers about the doctor’s earlier visit.

Although they were told Mr Gouldburn couldn’t move, his condition was not deemed a ‘red’ case and he was allocated a 60-minute response time.

It was midday by the time an ambulance arrived – and it was a St John vehicle.

Once the seriousness of the situation became apparent, an ambulance with an eight-minute response time was summoned and eventually arrived along with a rapid response car.

By then it was too late, and Mr Gouldburn was pronounced dead after a ten-minute battle to save his life.

Mr Donnelly ruled the former special needs teacher died of natural causes. Pathologist Dr Jan Lowe said Mr Gouldburn had an underlying heart condition – which was worsened by the stress of being on the bathroom floor for so long.

Lynn Corrigan, a dispatch manager for the North East Ambulance Service, blamed problems on a high number of urgent calls that day. She said there had also been delays in admitting patients to North Durham Hospital because of a lack of beds – which she described as ‘a national problem’.

'He gave his life to helping others and the (ambulance) trust failed him in his moment of need'

The inquest heard Mr Gouldburn’s carer and relatives made calls to the 999 and 111 emergency numbers – both of which are handled by the same call centre in Newcastle.

But the coroner was told there was nothing in the computer software to flag up that the family had called before.

Calls to both numbers are processed in a similar way, but the two systems are not linked – so handlers taking 999 calls will not know if 111 staff have dealt with the same patient.

Assistant call centre manager Geraldine Hope said a request had been made to hook up the two systems but Coroner Mr Donnelly described it as ‘a big gap’.

Bosses at the North East Ambulance Service admitted they did not have the 'resources to meet demand', adding it was a 'national problem'. The coroner ruled had Mr Gouldburn received medical attention sooner, it is likely he could have survived

Mr Gouldburn’s family hit out at the ambulance service trust’s failure to grasp the seriousness of the situation until it was too late.

Speaking after the inquest, they said: ‘This should never happen again to anyone. We simply want recognition from the trust that a mistake was made, and that the trust failed a fantastic man.

‘He gave his life to helping others and the trust failed him in his moment of need. We hope they will make sure as best they can this will never happen again to another family in Hartlepool.’

Tom Howard, head of the North East Ambulance Service’s contact centre, apologised to the pensioner’s family for not getting to him sooner.

He said: ‘Mr Gouldburn didn’t receive the level of care that he should have done.’

Ambulance services across the UK categorise each call according to how serious the patient's condition is.

The aim is to ensure the most serious, life-threatening calls are dealt with first.

The categories are nationally agreed, by the Department of Health and each ambulance service across the UK are measured according to required targets.- Red 1The most serious category, Red 1 is reserved for those patients who have suffered traumatic life-threatening injuries or those who are displaying the signs of suffering a heart attack or cardiac arrest.An ambulance is expected to reach a patient within eight minutes.Where possible two ambulance crews are dispatched to Red 1 calls - commonly a rapid response car, who can make initial assessments and start to treat the patient at the scene, followed by an ambulance, who can transport the patient to hospital.- Red 2The second most serious category is for all other life-threatening emergencies. Examples include patients who have suffered a stroke, with serious symptoms or those who are struggling to breathe.Similarly to Red 1 ambulance crews are expected to reach the patient within eight minutes of the 999 call being logged.

For both Red calls the response times are set out as national requirements rather than recommended times.

The guidelines dictate that an emergency response - usually in the form of a rapid response car - will reach 75 per cent of these calls within eight minutes.

Where onward transport to hospital is required, 95 per cent of life-threatening calls will receive an ambulance capable of transporting the patient within 19 minutes of the request being made.- Green 1These are serious but not life-threatening calls, for example diabetic problems or a suspected stroke with no serious symptoms.A Green 1 call requires an emergency response within 20 minutes.- Green 2Also deemed serious but not life-threatening, Green 2 calls can include suspected fractured arms or legs, or a patient who has fallen and maybe immobile.These calls require an emergency crew to be on the scene within 30 minutes.- Green 3These are non-emergency calls which require an on-scene response within 60 minutes or an assessment over the phone from the clinical support desk within 20 minutes. A patient who has suffered a suspected overdose, but is showing no serious symptoms, or someone who has suffered a non serious injury would be classified as a Green 3 call.- Green 4These are the least serious calls, which require emergency crews to be sent to the scene within 90 minutes or a telephone assessment within an hour.Minor scalding, a fall with no apparent injuries or someone in pain, but showing no serious symptoms would be classed as a Green 4 999 call.

Response times for Green calls are recommended and are set locally rather than being national requirements.
