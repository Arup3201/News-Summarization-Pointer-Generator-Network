Runaway MotoGP championship leader and defending champion Marc Marquez secured pole position for Sunday's British Grand Prix with a dominant display in final qualifying at Silverstone.

The 21-year-old Repsol Honda rider, beaten for the first time this year in the Czech Republic last time out having won all of the opening 10 races, finished Saturday's 15-minute second qualifying session 0.311 seconds clear of Ducati's Andrea Dovizioso.

Marquez suffered a minor crash on Saturday morning but, undeterred, went on to set fastest lap times throughout the day. His afternoon ended with a two minutes 0.829 seconds lap time, which earned him his 10th pole of the season.

Dovizioso will line up second on the grid, with Movistar Yamaha's Jorge Lorenzo completing the front row after finishing a further 0.035secs back despite having struggled to adapt to the tyres on day one.

Forward Yamaha's Aleix Espargaro, Marquez's Repsol Honda team-mate Dani Pedrosa and Lorenzo's Movistar Yamaha colleague Valentino Rossi will make up row two.

Bradley Smith in seventh was the first of the home riders - he edged narrowly ahead of Monster Yamaha team-mate Pol Espargaro. The pair were joined on the third row by LCR Honda's Stefan Bradl.

Pramac Ducati's Andrea Iannone finished 10th after a crash towards the end of Q2, with Britain's Scott Redding 11th ahead of his Honda Gresini team-mate Alvaro Bautista.
