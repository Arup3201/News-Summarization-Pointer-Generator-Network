Ever wanted to stay dry in a water fight? Melbourne clothing and technology label Threadsmiths has created a revolutionary T-shirt that remains waterproof no matter how hard you try to soak it.

Made from 100 per cent cotton, the plain white T-shirts called The Cavalier feature a 'hydrophobic' nano-technology application woven in the fabric and capable of repelling most liquids and dirt.

A patented technology, unlike other liquid-repelling applications and aerosols which can contain chemicals, the Threadsmiths website states: 'Our shirts emulate the natural hydrophobic properties of the lotus leaf.'

Melbourne clothing technology company Threadsmiths has created a waterproof T-Shirt using a patented technology

Despite the material's waterproof qualities, the fabric is made from 100 per cent cotton

'The Cavalier shirt contains no aerosol applications and no dangerous chemicals, and is completely safe to wear - as a shirt should be.'

Still breathable, the Australian invention's technology boosts the material's resistance to water and stains by causing it to simply bead up and roll off the fabric.

Creating a natural self-cleaning effect, any residue left on the material can be removed by just wiping or rinsing off it off with water.

Lewis Pitchford of the label said the the waterproof technology did not rely on the T-shirts being coated in hydrophobic sprays available in the U.S. such as Ultra-Ever Dry, reported the Herald Sun.

The woven technology has been patented and does not rely on the fabric being coated in hydrophobic sprays

'Most people are pretty amazed when they see it,' he said.

While the label currently only produces T-shirts, Mr Pitchford said he welcomed suggestions about what other garments to make using the fabric in the future.

There is speculation the fabric could be revolutionary for restaurants and cafes, where spills on tablecloths and aprons are a daily occurrence and also in the medical sector and hospitals, reported Eftm.com.au.

Machine washable, the waterproof effect will last for up to 80 washes.

The T-shirts are available for men and women and retail for $65 each, while children's T-shirts are coming soon.Â
