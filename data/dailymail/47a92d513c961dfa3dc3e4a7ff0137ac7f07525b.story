Danny Alexander will warn today that voters across Britain are flooding their MPs with their concerns at the prospect of Scottish independence

Voters across Britain are flooding their MPs with their concerns at the prospect of Scottish independence, a Cabinet minister will warn today.

Liberal Democrat Danny Alexander will attack Alex Salmond’s plan to end the union, calling the Scottish leader ‘a man without a plan.’

He will warn of a long list of potential disasters for the Scots if they vote Yes to independence, from the dangers to pensions and Isas to disruption for entrepreneurs.

Mr Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury – whose constituency is in Scotland – says people are ‘rightly starting to worry’, adding that independence ‘opens the flood gates to a sea of uncertainty on currency, rates and regulation’.

Speaking in Edinburgh, Mr Alexander will say the Scots have not been told what currency they will get paid in, what money they will use at a supermarket, the denomination of their savings or whether their pension is safe.

He will tell the National Association of Pension Funds’ annual conference that letters and emails are being sent from savers worried that their Isas won’t be protected, pension holders worried about the security of their funds and small businesses worried their accounts will ‘soon be with a foreign bank, in a foreign currency’.

His concerns echo warnings from a  growing list of major companies.

Yesterday the chief executive Shell – the UK’s most valuable company – became the latest to sound the alarm. Ben van Beurden said Scottish independence would threaten the UK’s ‘continuity and stability’.

Shell joins the likes of Standard Life, Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds TSB and Barclays in speaking out against a Yes vote.

Yesterday the power giant Aggreko also voiced its fears, threatening to quit its Scottish headquarters as independence would present ‘a number of risks’.

In a clear threat that it could leave 
its Scottish headquarters, it said: ‘As a global business, we will have 
plenty of options.’

Speaking in Edinburgh today, Mr Alexander will say: ‘We’re seeing a real increase in the letters and the emails to the UK Government from people worried by those questions.’

At the National Association of Pension Fund’s annual conference today, Mr Alexander will say letters are from ‘savers worried that their Isas won’t be protected'.

‘Pension holders worried about the security of their funds,' he will say.

‘Small businesses worried their accounts will soon be with a foreign bank, in a foreign currency.’

Tom McPhail, head of pensions research at the financial advisers Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ‘If we end up with separate tax rates or a separate currency, it would get even more complicated and costly.

‘The cost of all these changes will inevitable fall on ordinary investors and will reduce their investment returns and retirement incomes.’
