An air stewardess posted a photograph of a 'vulnerable' passenger online and called her 'an absolutely barking mad nutter'.

Claire Marshall Hernandez uploaded the image to a Facebook group, telling colleagues that the female passenger was an 'absolute nightmare.'

The Thomson Airways attendant, who has been disciplined for her actions, said the unidentified woman claimed to have been on the X Factor and began 'belting out' a Diana Ross tune, adding: 'She will keep you very busy.'

Miss Hernandez, 37, was on a return flight from the Caribbean when she secretly took a picture of the woman in her seat.

The mother of one, from Manchester, then uploaded the picture to the Thomson Airways Info Group on Facebook and criticised the passenger in the photo's caption, in which she added: 'Oh and she's got a stash of brandy in that handbag.

'She also blocked up the whole of the front toilet with God knows what.'

Miss Hernandez went on to criticise the woman's floral dress in a comment beneath her post, which received at least 12 'likes'. It is understood that a group administrator removed the post shortly afterwards, but not before it was spotted by a member of the public.

The man, who asked not to be named, said Miss Hernandez's post was 'appalling'.

He said: 'This lady is clearly a vulnerable adult. What the stewardess's post is saying, up to an extent, is that 'she is clearly unwell, however I am going to mock her and make a laughing stock of her'.'

He added: 'Considering that cabin crew are trained in ensuring that passengers are taken to their destination safely, supposedly without judgment, to look after the welfare of 300 or more people ... and considering the traveller is paying for the seat and expecting that, I find this appalling. This mocks the whole purpose of having someone there for your safety and welfare.

She said  the unidentified woman claimed to have been on the X Factor and began 'belting out' a Diana Ross tune, adding: 'She will keep you very busy'

'She is saying 'we are the number one holiday leisure company – however, we will mock you and cause you embarrassment on your travels'.'

A Thomson Airways spokesman confirmed that Miss Hernandez had been disciplined for her conduct but would not say if she has been sacked.

She said: 'We can confirm that the post was removed immediately, and the member of staff involved has been dealt with accordingly.'

A spokesman for airline regulator the Civil Aviation Authority said: 'Cabin crew do frequently find themselves in stressful situations. However, they should clearly treat passengers with respect.

'Airlines have a duty to ensure that cabin crew follow appropriate behaviour when dealing with passengers.'
