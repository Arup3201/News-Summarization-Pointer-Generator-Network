President Barack Obama's summer vacation off the Massachusetts coast has come to an end.

The
 president returned to the White House late Sunday after spending 
two weeks with his family on the island of Martha's Vineyard.

What
 a break it turned out to be. His attempt at rest and relaxation was 
largely overtaken by events involving Islamic State militants in Iraq 
and Syria, including the videotaped execution of an American journalist 
they had been holding hostage, and the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, 
following the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man.

Obama's vacation was largely overtaken by events involving Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria and the unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, following the fatal police shooting of an unarmed black man

Obama
 broke from his vacation to deliver statements on Iraq, Missouri and 
journalist James Foley on four separate occasions, including one 
delivered during two days he spent back at the White House in the middle
 of the getaway.

The unusual midvacation return to Washington had been 
scheduled before those issues came to dominate the news.

Still,
 in the midst of daily briefings on these and other matters, telephone 
consultations with world leaders and other responsibilities, Obama 
squeezed in nine rounds of golf on the island he has made his summer 
presidential retreat while shrugging off criticism about how he was 
spending the time away from Washington.

'Just 
because the president is in a different location doesn't mean he's not 
doing his job,' White House spokesman Eric Schultz said.

Obama
 also ate dinner out a few times, danced at a birthday party for the 
wife of Washington powerbroker Vernon Jordan, treated first lady 
Michelle Obama to a jazz performance and took the family to a fireworks 
show near the home of senior adviser Valerie Jarrett, who also was 
vacationing on Martha's Vineyard.

Obama returned toWashington, DC once during the vacation to attend national security meetings with senior staff

in coming weeks, Obama will travel to Charlotte, North Carolina, before stops in New York and Rhode Island on Friday to raise money for Democratic candidates ahead of the November midterm elections

Before leaving on Sunday, Obama and 
his wife went hiking with friends near the Obamas' rental home in 
Chilmark, on the western part of the island.

The White House did not 
identify the friends.

Back at the White House,
 Obama will have to decide whether Foley's killing and the broader 
threat the Islamist State extremist group poses to U.S. interests in the
 region and elsewhere is reason enough to now seek to intervene 
militarily in Syria.

"Just because the president is in a different location doesn't mean he's not doing his job," White House spokesman Eric Schultz said to critics of the president's leisure activities

He has resisted going that route for three years, 
even as the death toll in Syria's civil war approached 200,000, the 
government used chemical weapons against its people and the Islamic 
State group grew more powerful amid the chaos.

Pressure
 to go after the Islamic State inside Syria is coming from Obama's own 
military leaders, as well as some of his critics in Congress.

Obama also
 must weigh that thirst for forceful action against his aversion to the 
risks that could come with plunging the United States into a country 
that has been torn apart by an intractable internal conflict.

White
 House officials have suggested that airstrikes in Syria are an option, 
though the officials say specific military proposals have yet to be 
presented to the president.

Obama will be a rather scarce commodity at the White House in the coming weeks.

He
 plans to travel to Charlotte, North Carolina, on Tuesday to address the
 96th national convention of the American Legion, before stops in New 
York and Rhode Island on Friday to raise money for Democratic candidates
 ahead of the November midterm elections.

Travel
 to Estonia followed by attendance at a NATO summit in Wales begins 
immediately after Labor Day. The trip is expected to focus on U.S. and 
European concerns over tensions between Russia and eastern Ukraine.
