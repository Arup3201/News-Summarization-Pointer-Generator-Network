One of the most iconic moments in the history of America's civil rights movement has been remembered with a ceremony marking 50 years since the infamous 'stand in the schoolhouse door'.

It was on June 11, 1963, when then 
governor George Wallace tried to
stop two black students from registering for classes at the University of Alabama.

He stood  in the door at the university's Foster Auditorium and, in defiance of federal law, refused Vivian Malone and James Hood entry.

When federal marshals intervened, he stood firm and delivered an impassioned speech against desegregation.

Wallace eventually relented when a U.S. general acting under orders issued by President John F Kennedy demanded he make way. Malone and Hood then entered.

The incident brought Wallace into the national spotlight and led to the desegregation of the university as Malone and Hood made history by becoming the first black students to enroll.

Yesterday, relatives and community members gathered at the University of Alabama in the same auditorium where the two former students were admitted.

Darrell
Hood, the late James Hood's oldest son, said: 'You know he had a famous
statement. Good, better, best. Never let it rest until your good is 
better and your better is the best.

George Wallace's symbolic attempt 
to stop black students enrolling followed his inaugural promise of 
'segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever' and stop 
the desegregation of schools.

Eleven years earlier, the U.S. 
Supreme Court  handed down its landmark decision in Brown Vs Board 
of Education of Topeka, Kansas, in which it was argued the education of black children separate from white children was unconstitutional.

The Brown case meant the University
of Alabama had to be desegregated. But in the years that followed hundreds
of African-Americans applied for admission, but all were denied. The university worked with police to find any disqualify them, or 
when this failed, intimidated the applicants.

But in 1963, three 
African-Americans with perfect qualifications - Vivian Malone Jones, 
Dave McGlathery and James Hood - applied, and refused to be intimidated.
In early June a federal district judge ordered that they be admitted, 
and forbade Governor Wallace from interfering.

Then on June 11, Malone and Hood 
arrived to register, with Wallace attempting to uphold his promise. Federal marshals told Wallace to step aside but 
Wallace cut Katzenbach off and refused, giving a speech on States' 
rights.

It took General Henry Graham to 
command Wallace to step aside, saying: 'Sir, it is my sad duty to ask 
you to step aside under the orders of the President of the United 
States.'

Wallace, who survived an assassination attempt that left him in a wheelchair, died in 1998 having renounced segregationism.

'He was always one striving and he never wanted any of us to stop striving to be the best that we could possibly be.'

He said as he walked to the auditorium
he was overcome by the thought that his father once couldn't make that 
same walk, Alabamas13.com reported.

Sandra Richardson, Malone's cousin, said despite her part in history she never talked about the walk.

'She's very humble, very ordinary. She
didn't do anything that would draw a lot of attention to her, so you 
would never have any idea what great things she had done,' Richardson 
added.

Current Governor Robert Bentley said he watched the incident unfold from the street as a junior at the University of Alabama.

Black students, alumni and university leaders also spoke about what courage, change and progress meant to them and how the Stand in the Schoolhouse Door paved the way for their experience at UA.

Board of trustees member Judge John England, who was admitted to the University of Alabama School of Law in 1969, said the 
progress of the future lies in the same doors Jones and Hood walked 
through.

'We've got to be diligent to make sure that there are no closed doors and we're going to go through those doors,' England added.

'I've been inspired by the courage of all those people who came before me and those who were here when I was here.'

André Taylor, the first African-American president of the University of Alabama National Alumni Association, said that he first decided he wanted to go to UA the day of the 'stand in the schoolhouse door', as a child watching the news on TV with his mother.

'I'm having a very serendipitous moment, because it was 50 years, 1 hour and 17 minutes ago that I had the first thought of attending the University of Alabama,' he said.
