A Virginia construction worker who had fallen into a muddy 18-feet deep trench was dramatically rescued early on Friday morning.

The worker endured an eight-hour ordeal down the collapsed trench in Falls Church and was pulled from the hole shortly after midnight.

The man was conscious throughout the operation by Fairfax County Hire and Rescue Department which occurred when the muddy, rain-soaked ground collapsed beneath him during a home extension project.
