Every woman needs a beauty regime to keep her looking her best and this female gorilla is no exception.

In a bid to keep her hair silky smooth, and her skin and nails immaculate, Effie the 210lbs gorilla is taking vitamins and supplements meant for humans.

And since her daily dose of skin care supplement, she’s started attracting the attention of a potential suitor, the silverback Kumbuka.

Beauty of the beast: Zoo keepers have been giving Effie the gorilla a daily dose of multivitamin supplements to keep her hair silky, and her skin and nails immaculate in a bid to attract a mate

Keepers at the London Zoo have been giving her multivitamin supplement Vitabiotics Perfectil Plus Skin for the last year and since then her hair has got thicker and her skin improved.

Zoo keeper Dan Simmonds said: 'Effie has a big, charismatic personality, but for the last year or so, she had some dry skin, which was causing her some irritation.

'We always provide the best care for our animals, and we are absolutely delighted that Effie’s skin has shown signs of great improvement since she began her daily Vitabiotics’ Perfectil.

'As well as her skin, we have also noticed an improvement in the condition of Effie’s hair – it is now thicker and much healthier-looking.'

Silverback Kumbuka arrived at the zoo earlier this year from Paignton Zoo in Devon and has been spotted giving Effie the eye.

But despite his size – he is seven foot tall and weighs in at 406lbs – Effie is yet to give him the time of day.

While no one's looking: Effie is the 'teenager' of the Gorilla Kingdom group and has a reputation for stealing the others' food when they are not looking

In a bid to perk her interest, zoo keepers decided to work on Effie’s appearance after they used multivitamins to keep her companion Mjukuu healthy during and after her pregnancy.

Effie, the ‘teenager’ of the group at London Zoo, has a reputation of stealing the other gorillas’ food while they are not looking to satisfy her large appetite. Originally from the forests of central Africa, Effie arrived at the zoo in 2007 after a stint at a German zoo.

Effie's supplements have been checked and approved by zoo vets.

Kumbuka, a western lowland gorilla, was introduced to the zoo's Gorilla Kingdom to help boost numbers of the critically-endangered species in the European breeding programme.

He had not encountered females before arriving at the zoo in May this year.

Gorillas are the largest of all primates and adult males weigh between 350-600lbs while females weigh between 150-300lbs. They live in family groups and are led by a dominant male known as a ‘silverback’.

Western lowland gorillas live up to 35 years in the wild while in zoos they have an average lifespan of 35-45 years. The oldest gorilla on record died at 54-years-old.
