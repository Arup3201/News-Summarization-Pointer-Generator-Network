Fraudster: Lee Tyers was jailed for two weeks by Teesside magistrates after planting his own pubic hair to avoid paying a restaurant bill

A fraudster has been jailed after planting his own pubic hair in a restaurant meal to try and getaway with not paying.

Lee Tyers, 40, ate his entire curry dinner before telling staff he found a hair in his food and wouldn't pay the £39.55 bill.

But staff at Jamal's Indian restaurant in Middlesbrough knew Tyers was lying and caught him on CCTV putting his hand down his trousers before he made the false claim.

Tyers denied the charge of fraud by false representation but was found guilty by Teesside magistrates and jailed for two weeks.

Eatery owner Jamal Chowdhury told the court that Tyers had been a customer for around 18 years and already owed him £110 for previous unpaid meals.

But Mr Chowdhury told Tyers he would ignore the debt so long as he paid for that evening's meal.

Tyers assured the owner he had the cash to pay, before he and a friend ordered two lamb bhunas plus pilau rice, naan bread, drinks, a chapati and a shish 
kebab.

The pair ate their meals - then Tyers called over a waiter to complain about the hair in his food. After some discussion, the pair left the restaurant without paying.

Mr Chowdhury said: 'I told him all the staff have black hair and this is brown - it's not our hair.

'I told him if you pay for the meal now I will look at the CCTV video and if I find there's something wrong I will pay him back.

'I told him "If you don't pay, I'll call the police". I said "You're trying to ruin my business".'

Evidence: Staff at Jamal's restaurant in Middlesbrough, where Tyers already owed £110 in unpaid food bills, caught the defendant putting his hands down his trousers at the table

Speaking to the court as a witness in his own defence, Tyers, from Yarm, claimed his friend was the one paying the bill that night, and that Mr Chowdhury would not accept the payment and was insisting on the full amount owed from Tyers' previous visits.

He denied the incident over the hair took place.

Tyers' friend, also giving evidence to the court, backed up his claim, saying he 'tried to pay three times' but it was declined.

He said: 'He (Mr Chowdhury) said he wanted a-hundred-and-something pounds, and I said "that's nowt to do with me".'

Alex Bousfield, defending, said there was no physical evidence of the hair as the plate was not kept for police.

Following his arrest two days after the incident, Tyers answered all the questions put to him by police with 'no response'.

Prosecutor David Ward said Mr Chowdhury was a 'nice man' whose good nature had been taken advantage of.

He added: 'If Mr Chowdhury was offered £39.55, why wouldn't he take it? There's nothing on the CCTV that shows anybody trying to pay.'

Tyers was sentenced to two weeks' in jail and was ordered to pay £39.55 compensation.
