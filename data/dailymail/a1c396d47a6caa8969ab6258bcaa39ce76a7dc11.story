One was the American president, the other was a loner, and yet by chance there was one woman who knew them both.

Priscilla Johnson McMillan knew John F. Kennedy as a senator, when she advised him on Asia.

She interviewed Lee Harvey Oswald years later when she was a Russian correspondent for the North American News Alliance.

Remembering: Priscilla Johnson McMillan remembers meeting Oswald after she worked for JFK

Crossed paths: Ms McMillan explains how Oswald was spurred on by a sense of fate as JFK passed his shop

Half a century on, the 85-year-old has spoken out about the assassination.

Despite decades of speculation in books, articles and documentaries, she remains certain Oswald committed the crime.

And Kennedy, she says, would 'want to know why this young man had nothing better to do than go out and shoot someone.'

I was sorry for him because he seemed lost and as if he really didn't know what to do

- Priscilla Johnson McMillan on Oswald

Ms McMillan was living in Moscow in 1959 when she was asked by US embassy officials to reason with a dissident.

Coerced into meeting the former US Marine
 by negotiators who thought he might respond better to a woman, 
she was struck by how young he looked.

'He thought he was a great man who was going to assert himself for history,' she told Fox News, recalling her six-hour interview with Oswald in her hotel room during his bid to renounce his American citizenship to move to the Soviet Union.

'He looked like a college boy,' she said.

'I was sorry for him because he seemed lost and as if he really didn't know what to do.'

The Grassy Knoll: The spot where the assassin is believed to have been when the president was shot in 1963

Like millions of others, she was lost for words on November 22, 1963, when Kennedy was shot.

But as the day progressed and Oswald was arrested, her day took a strange turn.

'My God,' she remembers saying, 'I know that boy'.

He was motivated, she claims, by Marxist ideologies, and provoked by mental problems, a broken marriage, and a peculiar sense of 'fate' as Kennedy's car drove past his shop.

And she says with no doubt that he acted alone.

'He knew there was something wrong with himself, but he had these other things, delusions that he was something bigger than he was.

'He even told me in defecting to the Soviet Union that he "wanted to give the people of the United States something to think about".'

Widow: Marina Porter, Oswald's Russian wife, here in 1977, had grown fearful as her husband plotted attacks

She added that Oswald clearly intended the trial to be a political show trial by attempting to secure John Abt, the American Communist Party's chief counsel, as his attorney.

In the years that followed, Priscilla embarked on a journey to uncover the background.

She made friends with Marina Porter, Oswald's Russian widow, who was living in Texas by that point.

The couple had met and married in the Soviet Union years before and had two children, before moving back to America.

Having already suffered mentally for years, his marriage struggled as he obsessively plotted to shoot people opposing the communist movement.

He would want to know why he died, he'd
 want to know why this young man had nothing better to do than go out 
and shoot someone, much less go out and shoot him.

- On her friend, Jack

Years after Kennedy's murder, detectives connected him with the attempted shooting of anti-communist Army officer General Edwin A. Walker from his living room window in April 1963.

At one point, Marina told Priscilla, he announced he was going out to find Nixon. She locked him in the bathroom and grew fearful he was becoming violent.

In the months that followed, Marina left him, taking the children, and refused his pleas to reconsider.

The night before the attack in Dallas, he removed his wedding ring in an act that Priscilla believes was to protect Marina.

Paying tribute to the eponymous president, Mc McMillan reflected on his character.

She said: 'Kennedy was always asking questions, asking questions, he asked me many, many questions.

Legend: JFK, walking onto Love Field in Dallas on November 22, 1963, an hour before his death, is now an icon

'He would want to know why he died, he'd want to know why this young man had nothing better to do than go out and shoot someone, much less go out and shoot him.'

It is one of numerous memories expressed today to mark the anniversary of his death.

Flags are being flown at half-mast throughout the US today in what President Obama has declared a Day of Remembrance.

Last night, the Kennedy family both mourned and rejoiced, as they welcomed JFK's great-niece into the world.

Political: Lee Harvey Oswald would have wanted the trial to be a political show trial, Ms McMillan believes

Nora Kara Kennedy, daughter of Amy and Patrick Kennedy, JFK's nephew, was born at 3.11pm on Tuesday at New Jersey Hospital.

Mr Kennedy, 47, said that although it is a bittersweet week, this 'made it a whole lot sweeter'.

He told NBC10: 'I think this is so symbolic of the circle of life and how life keeps moving forward.

'We can look back in time and think about what would have been had my uncles lived but we have to live for today and we have to live for the future and they would want us to do that and that's why this marks such a special occasion.'
