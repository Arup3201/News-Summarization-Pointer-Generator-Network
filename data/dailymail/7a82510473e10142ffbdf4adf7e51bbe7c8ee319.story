Unpacking their Waitrose delivery earlier this month, one family from South London found a rather unwelcome addition to their order: a lethal spider.

The Brazilian Wandering Spider — the world’s most venomous species of arachnid — was nestling in a bunch of bananas and sparked a terrifying game of hide-and-seek before it was eventually captured by a pest control expert.

While autumn is a time when spiders traditionally come into homes as temperatures fall outside, at least in Britain we’ve always been able to console ourselves with the fact they will be harmless.

But thanks to our growing desire to eat imported organic food, this may no longer be the case.

Whereas in the past the animals would be killed off by chemicals used in the growing process, or cold temperatures, it is thought the trend for pesticide-free food — combined with unseasonably warm weather this summer and autumn — has been behind a recent acceleration in cases of Brazilian Wandering Spiders being found in our homes.

Britain has already seen an increase in False Widow spiders (native species and those accidentally brought in with imported items), which also pack a painful bite, for the same reasons.

Worryingly, no statistics are kept; the Government’s Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) said this week that responsibility lay with the retailers bringing in the deadly creatures with their produce.

Yet sightings of the Brazilian Wandering Spider — whose scientific name is Phoneutria, Greek for ‘murderess’ — have exploded in recent years.

In the past two months alone, there have been two incidents involving potentially lethal spiders. In both cases, egg sacs containing thousands of spiderlings were found.

Families who suspect the species has invaded their home are encouraged to evacuate so it can be thoroughly fumigated.

Worse still, the large arachnids — which can have a 6in legspan and are also known as banana spiders because of their penchant for nesting among the fruit — are extraordinarily aggressive.

Jake Willers, the naturalist and television presenter, said this week: ‘Most spiders won’t jump out and attack you. They only tend to bite as a last resort, when they are cornered and threatened. But Brazilian Wandering Spiders can be extremely aggressive and they will bite you repeatedly, injecting more venom every time.

‘For about 10 per cent of the population, particularly the very young, the elderly and those who suffer allergies, there is a genuine risk of death from the venom.’

Guinness World Records lists the Brazilian Wandering Spider as the most toxic on earth. Its venom is 30 times more powerful than that of a rattlesnake, leading humans to suffer an irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, vomiting and eventual death.

Despite an antidote being developed in the Nineties, there is currently no anti-venom stored in Britain.

In homes, the Brazilian Wandering Spider will usually search for cover and dark places to lurk during daytime, favouring clothes, shoes, boxes and log piles. If disturbed, it rears up and attacks.

This was the risk facing the family in South London with their Waitrose delivery. As the father put it: ‘Although people might think these things are funny, the spider could have killed me or my son if he’d gone to get a banana.’

Fortunately for them, the spider was caught by a pest control expert sent by Waitrose and its sac of hundreds of spiderlings was placed in the freezer to kill them.

Not everyone is so lucky, however. Matthew Stevens, 32, was working as a chef in a Somerset pub when, while wiping down a surface, he felt a pricking sensation in his hand. He dropped the cloth and a large spider fell out. When he tried to move it, the spider bit him again.

Thinking fast, he took a photograph of the arachnid with his mobile phone and a colleague drove Matthew to hospital. But with no major symptoms showing, he was sent home.

‘Within ten minutes of getting home I was practically paralysed down one side, my hand swelled up like a balloon,’ he said. He promptly collapsed, with his heart beating so hard ‘I thought it was going to come out of my chest’.

He was taken by ambulance to a different hospital where the image on his phone was sent to a specialist centre and identified as a Brazilian Wandering Spider.

Matthew was put on a saline drip to clear the poison out of his system and gradually recovered. Had he been a young child, he might not have been so lucky. With the long list of incidents which have unfolded since his experience in 2005, many pest control experts believe it is only a matter of time before there is a tragedy.

Last month Abby Woodgate, 30, of Essex, was told to incinerate her vacuum cleaner after using it to collect hundreds of Brazilian Wandering spiders which had fallen off a bunch of bananas.

In March, Jamie Roberts, his wife and two young children were ordered to evacuate their Staffordshire home for the same reason, until it had been fumigated.

Consi Taylor, 29, bought some Colombian Fairtrade bananas at Sainsbury’s in Hampton, South-West London, and had eaten about half when she spotted a white nest at the bottom of the fruit. As she bit into a banana the tiny black dots she assumed were bruises fell to the floor and scuttled away.

Pest control experts identified Brazilian Wandering spiders and the house was evacuated.

Supermarket staff are also in danger. Some Co-op and Tesco stores have had to close temporarily after these spiders were spotted.

Tesco warehouse worker lan Harbidge, from Cardiff, spent almost a month in a coma after a suspected spider bite last year.

He came home from work complaining of groin pains and discovered a rash. Soon his fingers swelled up ‘like sausages’ and he was taken to hospital, where he suffered kidney and liver failure. Yesterday, he told the Mail: ‘There has been no definitive answer to what caused it, but a spider bite is one of the most likely.

‘I didn’t handle any fresh produce in that warehouse but there were containers from all around the world. I don’t blame anyone for what happened. But this is a global market now and these things can happen.’

A spokesman for DEFRA said responsibility for dealing with imported venomous spiders lay with regional councils: ‘It should be reported to the local authority, who would get an environmental health officer to look at it, as this is related to food safety.’

But Matt Shardlow, chief executive of invertebrate protection charity Buglife, says: ‘People don’t need to worry about finding spider eggs on bananas. The spiderlings would have to be an awful lot bigger to pose any threat.

‘In their native environment, hardly any survive to adulthood; in Britain they’ve got no chance. It’s too dry for them to survive indoors and too cold outdoors.

‘Frankly there is no need for homes to be fumigated. That only happens because of the corporate need for supermarkets to be seen as taking action.’

There is also a trend for keeping spiders as pets, one of the most popular in this country being the Phoneutria Nigriventer, part of the Brazilian Wandering family.

‘That’s the most likely environment in which we’ll see someone bitten by one of these spiders,’ concedes Mr Shardlow.

Whether this reassures arachnophobes is another matter.
