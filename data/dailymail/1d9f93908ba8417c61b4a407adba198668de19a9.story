Claudio Marchisio's knee injury, picked up while away on international duty with Italy, is not as bad as first feared following an initial diagnosis that he would miss the rest of the season.

The midfielder was reported to have ruptured ligaments during international training on Friday - with the Azzurri claiming he could be sidelined for between six and eight months before the player returned to Turin for additional tests.

However, Juventus club doctors have confirmed that the 29-year-old has not torn his anterior cruciate ligament and should be able to return within two to three weeks.

Italy medics attempted to explain how they could have got their diagnosis so wrong. Speaking to Corriere dello Sport, Professor Enrico Castellacci said: 'Marchisio had a serious sprain and told me he heard a nasty noise inside his knee.

'I spoke to my colleagues in Turin, explained what happened and organised to send the lad straight to the club for further tests. Juve gave me the all-clear to make the diagnosis public.

'That night I contacted the Juve medics again before the Press conference. Now there are two contrasting test results.'

Juve released a statement confirming no serious damage had been found and the player would be continued to be monitored on a 'day-to-day' basis.

'The 29-year-old then underwent an MRI scan on his right knee this evening. The tests, supervised by Dr. Carlo Faletti at Turin's Fornaca Clinic, ruled positive, excluding the possibility of a tear to the anterior cruciate ligament.

'Marchisio will now rest and his condition is to be monitored on a day-to-day basis.'

Italy boss Antonio Conte is 'shaken' after receiving online death threats from Juventus fans

Italy head coach and former Juventus manager Antonio Conte was reported to be 'shaken' after receiving online death threats from angry fans blaming his training methods for Marchisio's injury.

'His (Marchisio's) injury was absurd and inexplicable. He hurt himself while warming up, running without the ball,' said Conte.

Sky Sport Italia suggest Marchisio could even be fit enough to play the second leg of the Champions League quarter-final with Monaco on April 22.
