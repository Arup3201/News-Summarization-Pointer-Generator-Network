Not lovin' it: Customer Webster Lucas says he was racially abused by a McDonald's store manager after a row about nakins

A McDonald's customer is suing the fast food restaurant for $1.5million because he was given only one napkin with his meal.

Webster Lucas claims he is now unable to work because of the 'undue mental anguish' and 'emotional distress' caused by the incident.

He launched the lawsuit following a row with the store manager at the outlet in Pacoima, California, on January 29.

Tempers seem to have flared after Mr 
Lucas complained that he had received just a single paper towel with his
 Quarter Pounder Deluxe.

Mr 
Lucas, who is African-American, says the he was racially abused by the 
manager when he went back to the counter to ask for more, 
according to TMZ.

The 
employee, who is named only as 'Angel' and is said to be 
of Mexican-American appearance, is alleged to have mumbled something 
that sounded like 'you people', Mr Lucas claims.

Mr
 Lucas wrote a letter to the restaurant's manager about the incident in 
which he complained of his treatment and said he has been mentally 
scarred.

Flashpoint: Mr Lucas claims he is now unable to work due to the 'mental anguish' and 'emotional distress' caused by the row sparked when he was given just one napkin with his McDonald's Quarter Pounder Deluxe, pictured,

He wrote: 'Good morning, after I received your email I called McDonalds in Pacoima and spoke with "Angel" (store manager) who despite the prior misconduct of his, he again was hostile and unreasonable.

'I simply don't understand, and it is sad that I encountered the now-current situation.

'Thank you, but I don't think that you will be successful in changing "Angel's deep-seated attitude towards customers.

'I am unable to work because of the undue mental anguish and the intentional infliction of emotional distress caused by your employee "Angel" who played around when I asked for the proper spelling of his last name... that I still don't have. Take care.'

McDonald's were unavailable to comment when contacted by MailOnline.

America is arguably the home of the outlandish lawsuits.

The annals of legal history are filled with people launching and winning massive payouts for the most extraordinary of reasons.

A woman failed with a $3m lawsuit against Starbucks after suffering severe burns after spilling tea on herself.

Rachel Moltner, 78, from Manhattan, claimed a double cup served from an outlet of the world's largest coffee chain was defective.

She spilled tea onto her left leg and foot when she tried to remove the lid from a 'venti'-sized cup, causing burns that required a skin graft.

However, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a lower court’s dismissal of her claim for damages.

Moltner was in a coffee shop on Manhattan’s Upper East Side when the accident happened in February 2008.

A case which has gone down in legal folklaw involved Merv Grazinski who set his Winnebago on cruise control, slid away from the wheel and went back to fix a cup of coffee.

The Winnebago unsurprisingly crashed.

Grazinski blamed the manufacturer of the motor homes, above, for not warning against such a maneuver in the owner's manual. He sued and won $1.75 million.

In 2007, a man sued a family-run dry cleaners for more than $65million after it lost one pair of his trousers 5 million for one pair of pants.

The Superior Court judge threw out the claim, which he called 'vexatious litigation' and awarded damages to the dry cleaners.

In 2006, A man from Portland, Oregon, sued sports giant Nike because he looked like basketball star Michael Jordan.

He launched the legal action 'for defamation and permanent injury' - plus $364 million in 'punitive damage for emotional pain and suffering'.

He claimed that he was constantly being mistaken for the star - despite being three inches shorter, 25lbs lighter and eight years older than the star.

He was convinced to drop the lawsuit by Nike's lawyers.

In 2005, A man from Burnsville, Minnesota, sued magicians David Blaine and David Copperfield because, he claimed, the illusionists were using 'godly powers' to defy the laws of physics.

He said that since he was God they must 'somehow' be stealing that power from him. The case did not go further.
