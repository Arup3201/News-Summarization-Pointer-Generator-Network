Family man: Bernard Gallacher (pictured with his wife Lesley and daughter Kirsty) was last night fighting for his life after suffering a suspected heart attack

Golf legend Bernard Gallacher was last night fighting for his life in hospital after suffering a suspected heart attack.

The Ryder Cup-winning captain was on a visit to Aberdeen when he complained of feeling ill and suddenly collapsed on Thursday night.

The 64-year-old Scot, who led the European golf team to victory over America in 1995, was last night described as being in a ‘critical’ condition at the city’s Royal Infirmary.

His daughter, Sky Sports presenter Kirsty Gallacher, is believed to be at his bedside with her mother Lesley, brother Jamie and sister Laura.

Gallacher had recently flown back to the UK from a family holiday in Spain and was due to make an after dinner speech at an event in Aberdeen.

The Daily Mail understands he has undergone a procedure to insert a stent into an artery and is presently in a coma.

An NHS Grampian spokesman confirmed Mr Gallacher was being treated in hospital and was ‘in a critical condition’.

Mr Gallacher’s nephew Stephen, who pulled out of the Wales Open during his second round on Friday morning, said: ‘I understand that he is critical but stable.

‘My family is in disarray at the moment and it is obviously a worrying situation. We are all anxious.’

George O’Grady, chief executive of the European Tour, said: ‘We are in touch with  Bernard’s wife Lesley and the Gallacher family and, obviously, we join with everyone in wishing Bernard a speedy recovery.’

Gallacher, who lives in Ascot, Berkshire, played in the Ryder Cup eight times and was non-playing captain of the European Team in 1991, 1993 and 1995.

He lost the first two competitive clashes but led the European side to a stunning victory on American soil in 1995 when they beat America by 14½ to 13½ points at the Oak Hill Country Club in Pittsford, New York.

A child prodigy, he began playing golf when he was just 11 years old and won the 1967 Scottish Amateur Open.

He turned professional in the same year and in 1969, at the age of 20, became the youngest player to represent Great Britain and Ireland in the Ryder Cup up to that time.

Gallacher also recorded his first win as a professional that year, taking the PGA Championship title.

Between 1974 and 1984 he accumulated another ten wins on the European Tour and also finished in the top ten on the European Tour Order of Merit five times between 1972 and 1982.

He later joined the European Seniors Tour, winning the Mobile Cup in 2002 and has also been a regular golf commentator on BBC Radio Five Live.

He was made an OBE in the 1996 New Year’s honours list.

Kirsty Gallacher, 37, had been on holiday in Spain with her parents and returned to the UK with her family – the mother of two is married to rugby player Paul Sampson – to attend a 60th birthday celebration for golfer Sam Torrance.

Gallacher and his wife Lesley are believed to have remained  in Spain for a couple more  days to finish their holiday before flying back to the UK this week.

It is not known whether he is in a medically-induced coma and there are no further details of his condition.
