He promised his Doctor will be ‘less user-friendly’ and a ‘little darker’.

However yesterday, just hours after Peter Capaldi finally made his  debut as the 12th Doctor, many fans questioned whether the timelord was now too scary for their children to enjoy.

As the 80-minute extended episode unfolded, fans took to Twitter to celebrate the show’s return, 51 years after the very first episode.

Peter Capaldi finally made his  debut as the 12th Doctor. But many fans questioned whether the timelord was now too scary for their children to enjoy

But some revealed the season-opener, called ‘Deep Breath’ had left their children more than a little unnerved.

A tweeter called Northsea_view said the show was ‘still scary’ and asked: ‘Shouldn’t it be on after the watershed? It disturbs children’, while  Andy Piper ‏complemented the ‘fantastic performances’ of Capaldi and co-star Jenna Coleman, who plays sidekick Clara Oswald, describing the show as ‘funny, scary and exciting’.

Vaughan Anscombe tweeted ‘#drwho clock work robots still scary just ask my daughter. She’s behind the sofa’, while a user called babesaurus wrote: ‘I liked it but I think it’s too scary for children.  Anyone have thoughts?’

A peak of 7.3 million viewers - and an average 6.8million -  tuned in to the BBC1 show - which was also played simultaneously at 440 cinemas in Britain, with cities in America, Australia and New Zealand hosting simultaneous broadcasts.

The episode achieved a 32.5 per cent share of the audience. Its nearest rival, Casualty achieved only 4.2 million but overnight figures are considered increasingly unreliable as many people now watch television on catch up services such as iPlayer.

Capaldi and co star Jenna Coleman had travelled 35,000 on a global publicity tour ahead of the new series, visiting seven countries over 12 days and stopping in cities including New York, Seoul and Rio de Janeiro 

Capaldi, perhaps best-known as a foul-mouthed spin doctor in The Thick Of It, spots different things about his new form, including his accent.

Capaldi’s Doctor announces 'I am Scottish I have gone Scottish', which he says is good because 'I can complain about things'.

‘Deep Breath’ saw Capaldi’s hero investigate a string of gruesome murders in Victorian London.

Capaldi and Coleman had travelled 35,000 on a global publicity tour ahead of the new series, visiting seven countries over 12 days and stopping in cities including New York, Seoul and Rio de Janeiro.

Capaldi replaced Matt Smith, 31, in the title role.  At 56, he is also the oldest since the first, William Hartnell.

Smith popped back for a small appearance in a telephone call to Clara and he asks her: 'Please tell me I didn’t get old - anything but old. I was young. Oh, is he grey?'

Jim Shelley, reviewing the opening episode of the new series on Mailonline, said Capaldi had ‘quickly confirmed that he has the type of wily charisma that makes it a role he was born to play.’

A few weeks ago Capaldi said in an interview his Doctor will be 'less user-friendly' adding: 'I was keen he be a little darker. He’s struggling with himself and who he is.'

A spokesman for the BBC said it was unable to produce data on any complaints the corporation may have received about the episode at the weekend.
