French police have found traces of blood belonging to a missing French beauty queen in a freezer that belonged to her father.

Allison Benitez's blood was found in a freezer at her father's French foreign legion barracks

The DNA was discovered at the French Foreign Legion barracks where Francisco Benitez worked before his suicide on August 5.

Investigators concluded the freezer had been scoured and washed along with a carpet, a few days after Allison Benitez vanished with her mother, Maria-Josee Benitez., from their home in Perpignan on July 14.

Mr Benitez took his own life after falling under the suspicion of police investigating the two women's disappearence.

He left a letter and video behind professing his innocence, before hanging himself in the barracks where he worked.

The Spanish national had sent emails to his parents, bosses and friends telling them he could no longer stand the suspicion he was under.

Sources close to the case said the chief warrant officer said he was innocent and declared his love for his daughter.

'We are a family, like every other family, with highs and lows. People 
who really know me, know that Allison is my life.

Today, I have a lot of
uncertainty…A lot of different things are going through my head. I’m 
hanging on, and hanging on, but I’m at the point of exploding' he said in a tearful video published by Paris match after he was found hanged in the barracks where the blood was found.

The two women's disappearance was 
initially treated as a simple missing persons case - one of the tens of 
thousands such incidents that take place every year in France - 
especially as husband and wife were separating.

seen since

Since the mother and daughter disappeared however their Facebook and Twitter pages have gone quiet and neither has used their bank account or answered their phone.

The pair also left behind their car and pet dog, a sign, say the family’s neighbours, that they did not intend to stay out long.

Mr Benitez claimed the 
two women had left Perpignan permanently and gone to Toulouse, but his story was undermined when police recovered the pair's passports in the 
family home. 

Fears were raised when it emerged a former mistress of Benitez had gone missing in 2004 under chillingly similar circumstances.

The last sign of life from Benitez’s mistress, the Brazilian Simone de Oliveira Alves, was a text message sent from her phone, telling Benitez she was leaving him.

Benitez told police the two had had a fierce argument, which Miss de Oliveira’s sister's Ivana recently suggested could have happened after she discovered Benitez hadn’t yet separated from his wife Marie-Josée.

The former mistress's sister even claimed that her she had been pregnant with Benitez’s child at the time she disappeared.

Earlier this month authorities opened a judicial probe into Allison and Marie-Josee's disappearance, admitting it had become a source of concern.

Allison,19, had been due to take part in the Miss Roussillon contest, due to take place on August 11, which elects a representative for a region of the southwest who will then go on to compete to become Miss France.

According to the contest's committee, the tall brunette was 'the most motivated' candidate.

The French Foreign Legion was founded in 1831 to enable foreigners to sign up and fight for France.
