Controversial: Tommy Robinson of the EDL says his group uses 'questionable' tactics

The leader of the English Defence League today admitted the far-right group has 'completely questionable' tactics in a controversial interview in which he called for a ban on the building of mosques in Britain.

Tommy Robinson also denied that his followers were responsible for a fire at an Islamic centre in London last week, suggesting that it may in fact have been the work of Muslims.

The BBC has been criticised for running the interview with Robinson on Radio 4's Today programme, with some listeners claiming that it gave a 'non-critical platform' for his extremist views.

A number of prominent journalists and politicians criticised the BBC's decision to interview Mr Robinson, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon.Former Labour MP Denis McShane directed his anger at presenter Sarah Montague, tweeting: 'Now Today provides non-critical platform for EDL. Has she ever seen them close up? Heard their racist insults? Violence threats?'

Former Ed Miliband adviser and Labour 
parliamentary candidate Polly Billington also tweeted: 'Our communities will 
suffer the consequences of this legitimisation of the EDL. @BBCr4today 
-totally out of touch.'

Director of think tank British Future Sunder Katwala added: 'Big @BBCr4today #EDL flaw to take at face value false statements from man with both violence & fraud convictions'

The EDL leader has returned to prominence following the killing of Drummer Lee Rigby in Woolwich, which has led to an increase in anti-Islamic sentiments in some quarters.

Mr Robinson, 30, tried to strike a conciliatory tone over some issues, saying he condemned attacks against Muslims and would not allow EDL members to make Nazi salutes.

However, he insisted that his group had nothing to do with a fire which partially destroyed an Islamic community centre in Muswell Hill last week, even though the building was daubed with the initials 'EDL'.

'If something was set fire and someone wrote "David Cameron" on the side of it, does it mean he did it?,' he said.

'It just seems ridiculous to me and I think everyone can see through it that that's done to make it look like the English Defence League.

'If I'm honest, I'm completely sceptical that it is even non-Muslims that have done that.'

Mr Robinson added: 'Our tactics are completely
 questionable, yes, and I understand people who say you are going about 
it the wrong way, but what choice do we have as working-class people, 
who, as soon as you put your head above the parapet, you're called a 
racist or a fascist? Who wants to sit down and talk to us?'

He did not explain exactly what he meant by 'questionable tactics', but the EDL is known for holding large rallies near 
mosques and heavily Muslim areas, while adopting a confrontational 
attitude which has previously led to clashes with anti-fascist 
protesters and Muslim activists.

'The 
non-Muslim community working class don't have a voice,' he continued. 'Where will it 
end? It's not going to end pretty at the minute is it, when you look 
what's going on.'

The EDL leader went on to say that 
Muslims should not be allowed to construct new places of worship until 
they implement a wholesale reform of their religion.

'I'd
 stop the building of mosques in this country until Islam reforms and 
works in this country with Western democracy and freedom,' he said.

Asked if he would condemn attacks by his members on Muslims, he replied: 'Utterly condemn it, disgraceful.

'Every single speech I gave since Woolwich, in fact in the last four years, condemn any acts of violence. So the only way to solve this is through democratic process, through peacefully protesting.'

Asked if he condemned any EDL member who gave a Nazi salute, he said: 'Well, I think if I was standing next to them there'd be a violent act. If you look into our history, I was actually arrested for assaulting someone doing that at our demonstrations.'

Anger: But the EDL is dedicated to peaceful protest, according to its leader Mr Robinson

Mr Robinson said that, if the EDL were in power, all Islamist preachers would be automatically jailed, saying: 'When they're calling for the implementation of Sharia law and to overthrow our Queen and our democracy, we'd intern them.'

He added that he believed his mission was to 'wake the British public up' and alert people to the danger posed by Islamic extremism, claiming, 'There's 100 Sharia law courts operating in this country.'

While insisting that 'all face coverings should be banned in public', including Islamic burqas and masks worn during protests, Mr Robinson said he understood why some EDL members covered their faces while demonstrating.

'Do you blame any person who's got a job within a council, say, and lives near a Muslim area, who wants to cover their face?', he asked.

He also claimed that he had been personally targeted by Islamic radicals, saying: 'I myself have had four official Osman warnings, I've been dragged out of my car, my children have been threatened to be decapitated.'

But Daily Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire said of allowing the leader on the show: 'Woeful interview with convicted footie hoolie Stephen Lennon aka EDL's Tommy Robinson. He'll laugh all the way to next EDL brawl.'

The director of the British Future think tank, Sunder Katwala, added: 'Big @BBCr4today #EDL flaw to take at face value false statements from man with both violence & fraud convictions.'

And Al-Jazeera presenter and Huffington Post political director Mehdi Hasan posted a blog with a list of ten questions he felt Radio 4 presenter Sarah Montague could have asked but did not.

He added: 'Put to one side for a moment the vexed issue of whether 'preachers of hate' such as Robinson or Al Muhajiroun's Anjem Choudary should even be given such high-profile platforms by national broadcasters.

'The bigger issue with this particular interview was that there was very little probing of Robinson's background or views; his offensive and conspiratorial claims about British Muslims and Islam were left largely unchallenged; the tone of the questions was polite and - dare I say - soft, rather than tough, rigorous or challenging.'

Labour Party member James Mills tweeted: 'The @BBCr4today interview with EDL leader Tommy Robinson was shocking, poorly researched interview prep, didnt challenge his false claims...'

Earlier this year, Mr Robinson was briefly imprisoned after he was convicted of attempting to travel to the U.S. using someone else's passport.

A BBC spokesman said: 'Today's programme looked at the recent rise in Islamaphobic attacks, such as the recent arson attack on a London mosque.

'The BBC has a responsibility to both report on the story and to try to offer insight into why it is happening. The EDL are a key part of the story and we believe it is important to reflect the fact that opinions such as those of Tommy Robinson exist.

'His views were challenged and we spoke to guests with alternative opinions elsewhere in the programme.'
