South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham spoke to an all-male, lily white group in Charleston this month – a political faux pas that would dog him days before an election, if he hadn't poked fun at them during his 20 minutes of remarks.

'I'm trying to help you with your tax status,' Graham quipped while open mics recorded his words. 'I'm sorry the government's so f***ed up. If I get to be president, white men in male-only clubs are going to do great in my presidency.'

The joke was on them, but the crowd laughed.

U.S. Sen Lindsey Graham campaigned for re-election on Wednesday while political wags turned the tables on him for a series of jokes he told at the Hibernian Club of Charleston

A short list of prominent organizations that don't welcome women or racial minorities still exist in the U.S. Augusta National Golf Club was one of the last stalwarts to fall. It excluded blacks until 1990 and admitted its first two female members in 2012.

Graham didn't seem fazed by the political dynamite he toyed with, CNN reported Wednesday.

He also bantered at the expense of the most populous religious group in the American South. 

'We got any Presbyterians here? We got any Baptists?' Graham asked from the podium. 'They're the ones that drink and don't admit it.'

A South Carolina Republican campaign strategist told MailOnline on Thursday that Graham's humorous approach was a deft political move.

'He had to try and be funny,' the operative said. 'The event would have attracted far more criticism, and serious complaints – the election is next Tuesday, for gosh's sake – if he showed up and gave a serious policy speech.'

'They would have swept him off the stage if he did than anyway. Those guys are brutal if you're boring. And it sounds like he was one of the more mild-mannered Hibernian speakers in a while anyway.'

Graham has confirmed that recordings of the event are accurate, but emphasized that he wasn't serious.

'They are great guys,' he told CNN.

The Hibernian Society, Graham continued, expects its speakers 'to be earthy, to make fun of yourself, to make fun of them. Then you say something serious and sit down.'

'And if you talk over 20 minutes, they throw something at you.'

The society hosts an annual St. Patrick's Day banquet where Vice President Joe Biden and former Vice President Dick Cheney have spoken.

No recordings of their remarks were readily available on Thursday, and the Hibernian Society couldn't be reached for comment.

Two Democratic Party activists leaked the Graham audio to CNN. 

Graham is a shoe-in to win re-election and could conceivably run for president in 2016, but his reputation as a supporter of immigration 'amnesty' would make him unwelcome in many GOP circles

The group's iconic meeting place, Hibernian Hall, is legendary for episodes of far more significant American history. It hosted a faction of Democrats in 1860 who plotted to nominate Sen. Stephen Douglas to oppose Abraham Lincoln for the presidency a year before a devastating civil war – fought over black slavery – broke out in the U.S.

Delegates slept in cots strewn all around the ornate building.

Graham has floated the idea of a long-shot presidential campaign, but the GOP strategist said it won't happen.

'If Lindsey runs for president, he's going to be tarred and feathered by his own party for embracing President Obama's immigration proposals,' he said.

'They don't call him "Graham-nesty" for nothing,' he jabbed.

Graham campaign spokesman Tate Ziegler told the Charleston Post and Courier that the senator's comments were 'delivered in a private roast-type dinner before a well-respected charity in Charleston'.

Democratic state Sen. Brad Hutto, who is running an unlikely campaign to unseat him, took it all seriously.

'When behind the closed doors of a private club, Lindsey Graham let his true colors show,' Hutto said. 'He is only interested in his own ambitions and the best interests of the wealthy donors he hopes will fund his possible presidential campaign.'

'Would have attracted far more criticism' if he spoke to the all-male group without making fun of it, says Republican campaign strategist
