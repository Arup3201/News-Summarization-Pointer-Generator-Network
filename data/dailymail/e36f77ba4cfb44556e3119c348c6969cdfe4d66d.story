'Too common for telly': Business reporter Steph McGovern, 31, said she encountered prejudice from bosses before she landed her on-screen role

A BBC presenter has claimed she receives ‘abuse’ from viewers because of her northern accent.

Steph McGovern, 31, who is originally from Middlesbrough and presents business news on BBC Breakfast, said her ‘strong northern accent’ still elicits disparaging remarks from viewers.

She added that she encountered prejudice from bosses before she landed her on-screen role.

Miss McGovern told the Radio Times: ‘Despite being a business journalist at the BBC for 10 years, working behind the scenes on our high-profile news programmes, I was viewed by some in the organisation to be “too common for telly”.

‘I remember at the end of one BBC job interview being told by the manager, “I didn't realise people like you were clever”. Sad, but true.’

The presenter added: ‘You would think that after nearly two years in the job, people would be used to my Teesside tones.

'To be fair most are, but there are still some viewers who can't accept that someone with my accent can have a brain. It means that I regularly get abuse about it.

‘I've had tweets questioning whether I really did go to university because surely I would have lost my accent if I did; a letter suggesting, very politely, that I get correction therapy; and an email saying I should get back to my council estate and leave the serious work to the clever folk.’

Miss McGovern said: ‘It's inevitable 
that not everyone will like me. All presenters deal with that. What's 
scary is the ignorance about what having a regional accent means.’

The presenter's first job at the BBC was
 as a part-time researcher on now-defunct technology programme 
Tomorrow's World, which she did while studying science at University 
College London.

On screen: Miss McGovern has worked on BBC One news bulletins, Radio 2, Radio 4 and Radio Five Live

The former champion Irish dancer soon 
became a financial news producer on the Today programme on Radio 4, and 
has also worked on BBC One news bulletins, Radio 2 and Radio Five Live.

She first presented on BBC Breakfast in August last year, and is one of the show's main relief presenters, presenting over Christmas 2012.

Last October she hit the headlines after saying ‘What the
**** is that?’ off-screen on Breakfast without realising her microphone was still
switched on.

During an item about musicals, host Susanna Reid had welcomed
conductor John Wilson to the studio, showing a clip of his orchestra before
wishing him a ‘good beautiful morning’.

Miss Reid later apologised for the 'unfortunate' language
and blamed a microphone not being turned off for the blunder.

Miss McGovern has a strong following on Twitter, where she regales her audience with humorous tweets such as the time she was told off for eating crisps in a train's 'quiet carriage'.

Today she tweeted: 'Not everyone is going to like me.  That's life.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.'

Wrong accent? Former Today programme presenter Edward Stourton was forced out of his job amid suggestions his accent was 'too posh'

In the 1950s, having a 'BBC accent' meant that you spoke RP, or the Queen's English, without a trace of a regional accent.

More recently, however, speaking this way could do you out of a job at the corporation.

In 2008 BBC Radio 4 Today presenter Edward Stourton was sacked by the BBC amid suggestions he sounded 'too posh'.

Embarrassed executives insisted that the hugely experienced presenter, who was educated at Ampleforth and Cambridge, and who presented the flagship news programme for a decade, was leaving to 'pursue other projects' and that modern listeners wanted a 'more light-hearted' style of presenting.

However Stourton disputed this, saying: 'I am leaving because they have removed me and there are no other projects.'  He went on to present The World At One and The World This Weekend as well as Sunday, R4's main religious and current affairs news programme.

In 2010 the BBC nailed its colours to the mast when Jana Bennett, director of BBC Vision, said the corporation needed to 'increase the amount of network TV content which offers distinctive voices with an authentic sense of place.'

She said more work should be done to ensure the BBC's output accurately reflected the UK's nations and regions, but insisted 'accents on their own' were not enough to make people from different parts of the UK feel represented.

The following year the BBC Trust said that R4 should 'give greater exposure to presenters from the North'.
