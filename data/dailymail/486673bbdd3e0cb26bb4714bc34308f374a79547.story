A carriage forming part of the train that carried Sir Winston Churchill’s body from his funeral is to be restored in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of his death.

Built in 1931, the Southern Railway luggage van no.2464 carried the illustrious former Prime Minister from his State Funeral at St. Paul's Cathedral, London, to his final resting place in Oxfordshire on January 30 1965.

But the carriage was not always used for such prestigious events - it was originally built to transport simple goods, such as vegetables and newspapers, around the country.

The carriage formed part of the train that carried Sir Winston Churchill’s body from his funeral and is currently being restored to mark the 50th anniversary of his death

It has now been loaned to the National Railway Museum in Shildon, where it will be exhibited early next year once cosmetic restoration work is complete.

Senior Curator of rail vehicles at the National Railway Museum, Anthony Coulls, said: 'Until the 1960s, the carriage was a fairly normal goods van. It carried things like vegetables and newspapers, goods that needed to go from place to place as soon as possible. 

'The carriage shows how the every day can become something quote important, and it is assured of its place on the national stage because of the part it played in Churchill's last journey.

'It is not a glamorous steam engine but it is something that is of great importance to the nation.

The funeral of Sir Winston Churchill is seen from inside St Paul's Cathedral in 1965 - by decree of the Queen his body lay in State in Westminster Hall for three days

'A lot of people still feel strongly about Churchill so it is good to commemorate that.' 

Churchill's funeral was watched by 300 million of people on television and attended by representatives from 112 nations.

The day saw thousands line the streets of London, where they paid their respects to one of Britain's most historical figures. 

The procession travelled through London to St Paul's Cathedral for the funeral service, before Churchill was laid to rest in the Oxfordshire Parish Churchyard of Bladon, situated close to Blenheim Palace, where he was born 90 years earlier.

The carriage had humble beginnings and was originally made to carry simple goods like vegetables and newspapers before being used for evacuations in World War II

The carriage was initially used as part of two evacuation trains during World War II, before later being transformed into the original umber and cream Pullman colours in the 1960s. 

In 1966, it was moved to Los Angeles to be preserved, but it was returned to the UK in 2007 and became a part of the Swanage Railway Trust collection.

On loan to the National Railway Museum from the Swanage Railway Trust, the carriage will be exhibited in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Churchill's State Funeral on January 30 next year.

Winston Churchill was born in 1874 at Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire, to aristocratic parents Lord and Lady Randolph Churchill.

He was said to be a poor pupil at school and did not have a close relationship with his mother or father - who died aged 45 when Churchill was 20.

He married Clementine Hozier in 1908 and had five children, Diana, Randolph, Sara, Marigold and Mary.

Churchill first joined the army in 1893 and had an illustrious military career which saw him sent to Cuba, India and Sudan. 

Alongside his military life, he also worked as a war reporter and was taken prisoner in South Africa while reporting on the Second Boer War in 1899.

Also pursuing political ambitions, Churchill won the seat for Oldham in 1900, later serving as Chancellor of the Exchequer and Lord of the Admiralty twice.

He first became Prime Minister in May 1940, following the resignation of Neville Chamberlain during World War II.

During the conflict, he was seen as a pillar of strength  and gave several memorable speeches that inspired the British public including a famous 1940 address to Parliament in which he bellowed 'we shall fight on the beaches...we shall fight in the hills....we shall never surrender'.

After losing the 1945 election, Churchill served as Leader of the Opposition for 6 years before becoming Prime Minster again in 1951.

He suffered a series of strokes during the 1950s and resigned as Prime Minister in 1955 due to his failing health.

He finally left Parliament, standing down at the 1964 General Election, and died on January 24 1965 at the age of 90 - exactly 70 years after his father.
