It was the match billed by Gary Neville as the 'Dog and Duck versus The Red Lion'.

And there were times at Old Trafford when both back lines showed as much defensive acumen as a bunch of hungover, overweight blokes chasing around cluelessly on a muddy park pitch.

In the end, however, it was Liverpool who were made to look the more amateurish as Manchester United took their chances to record a resounding win over their old rivals.

On another afternoon, Raheem Sterling might have succeeded in his personal duel with David De Gea and claimed a hat-trick. Frankly, Mario Balotelli might have done likewise in the second-half but for the Spanish goalkeeper's defiant, dominant performance. It could have been 3-3, even 5-3 to Liverpool.

But somehow, through a combination of De Gea's brilliance, some defensive improvisation and, most importantly, clinical finishing, United emerged victorious.

It was most definitely a case of square pegs into round holes with the team selections. Louis van Gaal once again reverted to the back three that has made United look so vulnerable this season.

Nobody looks entirely comfortable - still - but the Dutch coach hoped the inclusion of Michael Carrick in the centre would act as a lightning rod for the nervousness this system usually generates.

Either side of him was Jonny Evans, barely back from his injury lay-off but needed after Marcos Rojo picked up another injury in training on Saturday, and Phil Jones.

Liverpool favoured a back three as well, with Glen Johnson, Martin Skrtel and Dejan Lovren matching United's approach. Alberto Moreno was on hand to track back if required.

It was bold, especially for a team entering the game off the back of a deflating week that had seen them crash out of the Champions League, but Liverpool started very positively.

The chaos that is United's back line this season was evident immediately as Philippe Coutinho whipped in a second-minute corner and United needed several swings of the boot to clear the danger.

Marouane Fellaini's tendency to look for a backwards pass rather than an adventurous one heaped unnecessary pressure on Jones and Carrick early on and United certainly didn't look like a side entering the fixture off the back of five consecutive wins.

The United back line was carved open for the first time on 11 minutes, caught gawping as Adam Lallana's through pass set Sterling one-on-one with David De Gea, the Spanish goalkeeper standing tall to block in what would become a running theme of the afternoon.

25 seconds later, Liverpool had been punished for the miss in ruthless fashion. Moreno and Joe Allen were confused by Antonio Valencia, who nutmegged the latter and crossed for Wayne Rooney to sweep the ball home.

Goalkeeper Brad Jones, in for the woeful Simon Mignolet, didn't exactly cover himself in glory by diving early and completely the wrong way.

Perhaps former United defender Rio Ferdinand put it best, tweeting: 'The way Valencia just stood up them 3 LFC defenders & Bacardi breezed was nuts.'

The way Rooney was allowed to steam in unchecked by any Liverpool defender was as alarming for Rodgers.

While Carrick was having the intended effect at centre-half, a model of consistency in his passing and reading of the play, Jones was finding Sterling a handful.

He was again rescued by De Gea on 23 minutes, when his England colleague turned him with ease. Jones was senselessly anticipating a cut-back, Sterling left him looking like a statue.

Some of the challenges were seismic, as you might expect from this fixture. Jones and Evans went into the book for tripping Coutinho during the first-half, walking a tightrope. Fellaini was booked too, to nobody's surprise.

Johnson wasn't injured by one of these thunderous challenges but felt something in his groin and limped off, to be replaced by Kolo Toure.  

Juan Mata doubled United's lead from an offside position five minutes before half-time but it showed something of Liverpool's lack of confidence that only one of their defenders bothered appealing.

Five minutes into the second-half and United's defensive gremlins surfaced again. Evans played a slack back pass, allowing Sterling to run through one-on-one with De Gea. Again, the goalkeeper prevailed, Old Trafford breathing a sigh of relief.

Liverpool continued to push, the game was not up in their eyes. Mario Balotelli, introduced at half-time, was thwarted initially by a superb Jones slide tackle, before De Gea pushed his resultant snapshot against the crossbar. 

Where United would be without the young keeper is unthinkable. Certainly not in third place, probably not even in the top half. Far more than being a much-needed last line of defence, he's been a match-winner in at least half-a-dozen games this season already. 

Liverpool's greatest defensive shambles of the afternoon allowed United to wrap it up 20 minutes from the end. 

Lovren's clearance of Rooney's low ball was atrocious, falling straight to Mata who wisely shifted the ball wide to the unmarked Van Persie. With Jones again diving too soon, the Dutchman swept the ball into an empty net.

The Dog and Duck would be proud.
