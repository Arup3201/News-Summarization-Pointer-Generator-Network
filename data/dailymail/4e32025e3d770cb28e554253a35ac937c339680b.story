It has been revealed that ESPN seriously considered banning use of the controversial Redskins nickname from reporting.

ESPN ombudsman Robert Lipsyte wrote in a column published Friday that the network considered no longer using the nickname of the Washington NFL Franchise.

The consideration came as calls mount for team owner Dan Snyder to rename the team – redskin is a derogatory term used to degrade Native Americans.

The internal debate was revealed in a column focusing on Miami Herald baseball writer Dan Le Batard giving his Baseball Hall of Fame vote to Deadspin. Le Batard also hosts a radio show on ESPN Radio and is a frequent on-air guest for the network.

The disclosure came when Mr Lipsyte said it is against ESPN policy for its reporters to be ‘in the position of making news as well as covering it’ when discussing his reservations against baseball writers voting on hall of fame inductees.

‘That is against ESPN policy (and recently was one of the in-house arguments against banning use of the nickname of the NFL Washington franchise),’ he divulged.

ESPN considered no longer referring to the team by its official nickname as dozens of media outlets and reporters across the country have decided to refer to the franchise as a myriad of things other than Redskins.

A recent Pew study showed that at least 76 publications, networks and journalists have publicly opposed the offensive team name.

The term has long-been a thorn in the side of Native Americans around the country, but it once again became an issue last year after Washington, D.C., Mayor Vincent Gray told a group of reporters in January that he would change the name.

The movement gathered momentum in the following few months as various Native American groups argued to the government the trademark should be revoked and almost a dozen members of Congress publicly lobbied Mr Snyder to change the name.

‘We’ll never change the name of the team,’ the defiant owner told USA Today in May, ‘it’s that simple.’

A wave of media organizations and columnists including multiple D.C. outlets, the San Francisco Chronicle, The Oregonian (since 1992), Sports Illustrated’s Peter King, MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow and others have all vowed to no longer use the name.

The Washington Post publicly blasted Mr Snyder for not changing the name, and President Barack Obama also said he would change the name if it were his call.

Several prominent broadcasters including NBC’s Bob Costas and Chris Collinsworth as well as ESPN’s Keith Olbermann and Tony Kornheiser have called for the name to be changed.

Mr Costas notably made his plea during halftime of a national televised game between the Washington football franchise and the Dallas Cowboys.

It’s worth noting that 66 per cent of D.C. area residents feel the team should keep its name, according to Pew.

It would have violated a policy against network employees making news instead of just reporting
