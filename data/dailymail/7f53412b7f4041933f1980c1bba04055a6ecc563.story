A rodeo clown who dressed as Barack Obama and asked the crowd if they wanted to see the President 'run down by a bull' was today banned from the Missouri State Fair for life.

The unnamed stuntman was widely criticized by Democratic and Republican officials after the controversial act on Saturday.

The clown won't be allowed to participate or perform at the fair again and fair officials said they were also reviewing whether to take any action against the Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Association, the contractor responsible for the event.

Numerous Missouri officials denounced the act after video and photos were posted online. Some Democratic Missouri lawmakers suggested on Monday that there should be financial consequences for the fair.

Anger: A rodeo clown dressed as Obama has angered visitors to Missouri State Fair

The fair said in a written statement 
announcing the clown's ban that he had engaged in an 'unconscionable 
stunt' that was 'inappropriate and not in keeping with the Fair's 
standards.' The fair's press release did not identify the clown.

At
least one person defended him. David Berry, a Missouri Rodeo Cowboy 
Association member who was at Saturday's event, described the clown as a
friend and said there was nothing offensive or unusual about his 
actions. Berry said the Obama character was meant to look like a dummy 
and that rodeo clowns have long performed such acts, often imitating 
sitting presidents.

'The 
joke is not that it was the president,' Berry said. 'They drag out this 
person dressed like a dummy and all of the sudden this dummy just takes 
off running. That's what's funny.'

But other rodeo professionals said the Missouri fair stunt appeared to go too far.

'It's
not unheard of for a rodeo clown, depending on how he reads his 
audience, to play politics a little bit,' said Jim Bainbridge, the 
senior public relations coordinator at the Professional Rodeo Cowboys 
Association, based in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

'But
this crossed a line. Clearly, when you're suggesting that the president
should be injured, it kind of gets to a level of hostility that is 
inappropriate.'

Outcry: Many people took to Twitter to condemn the rodeo act

Perry Beam,
an attendee who posted a photo of the event on Facebook, has said it 
had the feeling of Ku Klux Klan rally. He said that, at one point, 
another clown ran up to the one wearing the Obama mask and played with 
the lips on the mask.

The 
rodeo's announcer — whom some media initially identified as making the 
comments about Obama — sought Monday to distance himself from the 
clown's actions.

Announcer 
Mark Ficken said through an attorney that the clown was wearing a live 
microphone and had given the announcer no advance notice about the skit.
Ficken is president of the Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Association and also 
is superintendent of the Boonville School District.

'He
was as surprised as anyone with the appearance of an Obama-masked rodeo
clown,' said Ficken's attorney, Albert Watkins of St. Louis.

Watkins
said Ficken's only comment during the event was to say, 'Watch out for 
that bull Obama!' Watkins said that was meant as a warning for the 
clown's safety.

Fair 
Marketing Director Tammie Nichols said the rodeo clown was hired by 
Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Association and that fair officials did not know 
he was going to mock Obama.

'We've
worked with this company for many, many, many years. We have a 
longstanding history with them and never had any trouble,' Nichols said.

The
association did not respond to an email request from AP for an 
interview on Monday and had removed the names of its officers from its 
website. A statement on the site said the association's directors are 
'dealing with the situation firmly and quickly as this type of behavior 
will not be tolerated.'

Most
of the Missouri State Fair's roughly $4.5 million budget comes from 
fees charged to attendees and vendors, but it receives about $558,000 
from tax revenues, according to the state budget office.

Missouri
House Democrats have suggested the Republican-led chamber should form a
special committee to investigate the incident and determine whether to 
continue providing tax dollars to the fair.

State
Republican Steve Webb, chairman of the Missouri Legislative Black 
Caucus, said Democratic Governor Jay Nixon should cancel the governor's 
annual ham breakfast scheduled for Thursday at the fairgrounds. But 
Nixon spokesman Scott Holste said the governor did not plan to cancel 
the breakfast because of the 'deplorable actions that took place during 
this one event.'

The stunt on Saturday raised fresh concerns about how ridiculing President Obama is nothing more than thinly veiled racism. 

One
of the other rodeo clowns wobbled the lips of the Obama mask, and the 
man wearing it was forced to run after a bull gave chase, according to a
man who witnessed the event.

Boycott: The stunt led to some families and politicians saying they will stop visiting the fair

A
couple who had taken a foreign exchange student to the fair to show 
them American life said they left in disgust after seeing the offensive 
stunt, according to the Kansas City Star.

Senator Claire McCaskill called the event shameful and unacceptable, according to CBS St Louis.

'The
young Missourians who witnessed this stunt learned exactly the wrong 
lesson about political discourse - that somehow it’s ever acceptable to,
in a public event, disrespect, taunt, and joke about harming the 
President of our great nation,' Ms McCaskill said.

The Jackson County Democratic Party also issued a statement that called the rodeo 'a show as ugly as any you could see.'

'Encouraging
physical harm to the President, whatever the party, is not acceptable 
and should not be tolerated,' the statement read.

Anti-Obama sentiment is high in rural Missouri, where the President lost 60-40 per cent to Mitt Romney in the 2012 election.

However, the rodeo clown dressed as 
Obama was considered by many to be a joke too far, especially 
considering the fair, which sells itself as being suitable for people of
all ages, is said to have received about $400,000 from Missouri tax 
payers.

Jeff Mazur, 
executive director at the American Federation of State, County and 
Municipal Employees, was one of many people who took to social media to 
condemn the event.

'I 
like rodeos, I like funnel cake. I like the MO State Fair. Barely-veiled
racism, anti-Americanism and violence fantasies ruin them,' he said on Twitter.

His
comments were backed by several Republicans, including Jeremy LaFaver, 
who said he would no longer be taking his family to the state fair.

St
Louis treasurer Tishaura Jones tweeted on Sunday: 'Racism rears its 
ugly head at MO State Fair ... the fair needs to do a better job 
welcoming ALL Missourians.'

According to CBS St Louis, she added: 'Since November 2008, racism has been masked under the guise of "anti-Obama sentiment".'

State
Republican Gail McCann Beatty said she was angered and disgusted by 
'the blatant racism', adding: 'This is an embarrassment to the People of
Missouri.'

Caleb Rowden, another Republican, added on Twitter: 'I don’t agree w/ this Prez on 
many things. But he is deserving of respect and shouldn’t be the object 
of political stunts. Out of line!'

Several people took to the state fair's Facebook page to state their disgust at the rodeo show, saying it was disrespectful and claiming they would boycott the fair next year.

A spokesman for Missouri State Fair earlier told Mail Online:
'The performance by one of the rodeo clowns at Saturday's event was 
inappropriate and disrespectful, and does not reflect the opinions or 
standards of the Missouri State Fair.'

Kari Mergen added: 'We strive to be a family friendly event and regret that Saturday's rodeo badly missed that mark.'
