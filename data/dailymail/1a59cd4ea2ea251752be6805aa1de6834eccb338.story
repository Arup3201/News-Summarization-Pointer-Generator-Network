Two police officers fired on a man who was acting erratically and dodging cars on a busy Manhattan street on Saturday night, wounding two bystanders and sending people running for cover.

The man allegedly made movements suggesting he had a weapon and police sources say he was trying to make officers shoot him in a 'suicide-by-cop' attempt.

The man, who was not injured by the bullets, has been identified as Glenn Broadnax, 35, of Brooklyn.

There were chaotic scenes near Times Square on Saturday night as an 'emotionally disturbed' man grappled with police who thought he might be armed

Injured: A bullet struck this 54-year-old woman in the right knee, she was taken to hospital where she is in a stable condition

The officers' shots missed him, and he was eventually brought down by a stun gun, while two innocent bystanders were injured in the leg and buttocks, respectively.

Broadnax is in custody and faces multiple counts including menacing, riot, 
criminal possession of a controlled substance, and resisting arrest.

The encounter happened just before 10pm near the Port Authority Bus Terminal, a block away from Times Square.

Cell phone footage filmed by bystander 
John Gilliland shows a chaotic scene in the middle of the intersection, 
as numerous NYPD officers circled the man and fired several shots. 

There is chaos as Broadnax repeatedly gets up from the ground and despite being surrounded by cops it takes over a minute before they finally 
overpower him.

According to the New York Post, police sources say Broadnax's behavior was a suicide attempt and he wanted to be shot by police.

'Sometimes when they do that, go into their pockets like that, they want to die. They want you to shoot them,' the source said.

'You have that split second to decide, and if you’re wrong... if they have a gun and you don’t think they do, they can blast you away.'

Officers were first alerted to the incident after witnessing the man on foot weaving through traffic and sometimes blocking vehicles.

‘It appeared he wanted to be struck by cars,’ Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said at an early morning news conference.

As officers approached, police said, the man reached into his pocket as if grabbing a weapon, and two officers fired a total of three shots.

The bullets struck 54-year-old Theodora Ray in the right knee and a grazed a 35-year-old Sahara Khoshakhlagh in the buttocks.

Photos and video taken by onlookers showed a chaotic scene. Several officers tried to contain the man as he moved through an intersection, and he was finally brought down as people in the crowd yelled at police not to shoot him.

Broadnax was taken into custody after a sergeant subdued him with a Taser, police said.

He was taken to Bellevue Hospital, 
where he was in stable condition, police said. Authorities described him
as ‘emotionally disturbed.’

The
women were taken to hospitals, where they both were listed in stable 
condition, according to police. Neither had injuries considered life 
threatening, police said.

The officers who fired their weapons had been on the force for one-and-a-half years and three years, police said.

Police did not release the names of the women.

In
August 2012, nine people were injured from bullets fired by police in a
confrontation with a gunman near the Empire State Building.

They
were hit by stray bullets, ricochets and fragments, suffering 
non-life-threatening gunshot and graze wounds. Officials at the time 
defended the officers' decision to fire on a street crowded with people.

Police
guidelines tell officers to avoid unnecessarily endangering innocent 
people. But police are allowed to use deadly force when faced with an 
imminent threat of serious injury or death.

On
Sunday morning, several police vehicles and half a dozen officers were 
still stationed outside the bus terminal at the intersection of 42nd 
Street and Eighth Avenue, but the area was busy as usual, with crowds of
tourists.
