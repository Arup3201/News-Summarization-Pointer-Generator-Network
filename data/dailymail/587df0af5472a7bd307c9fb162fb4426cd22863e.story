It is no secret that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge share a love of Africa: Prince William first visited the country during his gap year and the couple got engaged on a safari holiday in Kenya.

So what better gift to mark the birth of their son, Prince George, than a sterling silver figurine of an African animal?

The Mail on Sunday has discovered that William and Kate’s closest friends have bought presents for the baby from upmarket designer Patrick Mavros, who has shops in London, Harare and Mauritius.

Jewel in the crown: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been receiving gifts from friends made by their favourite jeweller

Animal magic: Jeweller Patrick Mavros first started drawing birds of prey after he contracted polio in his native Zimbabwe. He later started making jewellery based on his designs. Left, a meercat, right, a baboon and baby

The Duchess has long been a fan of Mavros – she discovered him when she was designing jewellery at Jigsaw and bought £70 crocodile stud earrings, £150 Ndoro drop earrings and a £250 Zozo elephant pendant – and has taken her mother and sister to the Fulham Road shop.

Now she has introduced Prince William and Prince Harry to the designer, and she and William are believed to be collecting the firm’s miniatures to decorate their apartment in Kensington Palace.

The miniatures range from a £110 warthog scratching to an elephant cow and four calves at £4,700.

The Royals are in good company – author J. K. Rowling bought a silver Mavros dodo, inspired by the island of Mauritius, where the extinct birds lived, and Prince Juan Carlos of Spain asked Mavros to customise the gearstick of his Maybach car with a gold pangolin, which is similar to an anteater.

Little gem: The sterling silver African animals make the perfect gift for the baby Prince. His parents got engaged during a visit to Kenya, in the East of the continent

Last night Patrick’s son Alexander, 33, who runs the UK shop, refused to comment on the gifts.

‘We are lucky to have some great customers and we are always grateful for the support we have received from them,’ he said.

His father was equally reticent about discussing the Royal couple.

‘I have never been to the homes of the Royal Family  so I don’t know what they have got,’ he said. ‘I think it is remarkable how discreet their friends are.’

Miniatures: Mavros's designs range from £110 for a warthog to £4,700 for an elephant and her calves

With his untamed hair, bushy beard and piercing eyes, Zimbabwean jeweller Mavros, 60, is not an obvious figure to be attracting such an elevated clientele.

But he has gained a cult following among the Royals.

He began drawing birds of prey at the age of five in his native Matabeleland, in the western province of Zimbabwe, after he contracted polio and was unable to walk for a year.

But it was not until later in life that he began making jewellery – he trained as a baker and served as a soldier in the Rhodesian wars before making a pair of rosebud earrings out of ivory for his wife Catja, 57.

‘The local hairdresser liked them so I gave a pair to her and the business grew from there,’ he laughed.

He studied lost-wax casting, where a mould is used only once to make the piece original, working in silver.

His business has been so successful that his four sons have followed him into the profession: Alexander runs the London store; Forbes, 32, designs jewellery in Mauritius; and Pat, 28, and Ben, 25, are based in Harare.

‘I try to take stories from our tribal customs and put them together in such a way that the stories are interesting,’ Mavros said.

‘If a couple get married, the  most appropriate gift to give them would be a Klipspringer, a couple of small antelope, who are the closest couple in the animal kingdom.

‘But for a couple with a new baby? I imagine there would be a whole host of animals protective of their babies.

'But what I think would be the most appropriate gift would be a young elephant calf walking under the belly of its mother while a bull stands by. After all, it could become a herd one day.’

The Royal couple have received many presents for their son, despite their suggestion that wellwishers give money to charity instead.

Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall bought cashmere blankets, cardigans and hats from Scottish warrant-holder Johnstons of Elgin.

David Cameron sent a set of Roald Dahl books, Ed Miliband gave an apple tree and Nick Clegg sent a bag of coffee and a cot cover and sheet embroidered by Spanish nuns in his wife Miriam’s home village.

Out of Africa: No river on the continent is said to be really wild unless it is inhabited by crocodiles, the most successful ancestor of the dinosaurs. This silver specimen would set you back £3,200
