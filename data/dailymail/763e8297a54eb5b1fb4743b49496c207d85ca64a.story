Celebrities love to court friends in high places, and in one of the more peculiar pairings of recent times Princess Beatrice enjoyed a double date on Wednesday with funny man Jimmy Carr.

The two apparent pals dined out at exclusive London restaurant Zuma with their respective other halves.

Beatrice was joined by long term boyfriend David Clark for the meal, while Jimmy was accompanied by his partner Karoline Copping.

Famous friends: Dave Clark, Jimmy Carr, Karoline Copping and Princess Beatrice were spotted leaving Zuma Restaurant last night after a meal together

Both the women chose to wear leather jackets while the gentleman opted for suit jackets for the meal at the high-end Japanese eatery

Beatrice wore a colourful print mini dress, cinched in at the waist with a studded leather belt and left her hair loose

Leaving the luxury Japanese eatery the foursome looked happy and relaxed in each others company, walking alongside each other.

Perhaps inspired by the vibrant shades her recent jaunt to Morocco where she attended the second wedding of another celebrity friend Poppy Delevingne, Beatrice, 25,  wore a colourful printed mini dress, cinched in at the waist with a studded leather belt.

She added some edge to her outfit with a black leather jacket and high heels, while her 31-year-old boyfriend Dave, a Virgin Galactic executive, kept his look a bit more conservative in jeans and a navy jacket.

Jimmy also opted for a suit jacket, choosing a more casual round necked T-shirt underneath.

The comedian and presenter, 41,  was joined by girlfriend Karoline Copping, a commissioning editor for Channel 5 who he has been dating since 2001.

Karoline chose a busy blue and white printed dress for the evening and, mirroring Beatrice, teamed it with a black leather jacket and high heels.

Despite having only recently returned from a weekend of partying for Poppy Delevingne's second wedding in Morocco, Beatrice showed no signs of fatigue

Knightsbridge restaurant Zuma serves a twist on the traditional Japanese izakaya style cuisine, and the double daters spent several hours working their way through the menu.

Last night marks just one of many social events the Princess has attending recently.

Regularly seen out at celebrity hot spots and rubbing shoulders with the A-list, Beatrice has just returned from the star studded second wedding of model and socialite Poppy Delevingne to James Cook in Morocco.

The young royal joined other guests including models Alexa Chung, Cara Delevingne, Suki Waterhouse and Georgia May Jagger, actress Sienna Miller and fashion designer Matthew Williamson.
