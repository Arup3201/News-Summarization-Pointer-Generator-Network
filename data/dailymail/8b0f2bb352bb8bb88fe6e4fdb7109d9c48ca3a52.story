Gang rape: The alleged victim said Jack McCullough also allowed his friends to sexually assault her

Half a century after the alleged crime, a former police officer, now an elderly 72-year-old, is on trial, charged with raping his 14-year-old half sister.

The 1962 assault left such a mark on the victim, now age 64, that she fought back tears as she testified about the day Jack McCullough offered her a ride in his red and white convertible and then took her to his apartment and raped her in the dark.

The charges were filed after police began investigating McCullough for an even older crime -- the abduction and murder of Maria Ridulph, 7, who disappeared from Sycamore, Illinois, in 1957.

The statute of limitations on rape in Illinois is 10 years. The crime must be reported within three years. Prosecutors can charge McCullough because he left the state shortly after the alleged attack.

The victim, who is retired after a career as a university professor and a hospital chaplain, said after McCullough was finished raping her, he asked three of his friends if they wants to assault her, as well.

Two of them also took advantage of the young teen.

The woman said it was a warm day in 1962 when her half brother, home from a stint in the military, visited her family in Sycamore, Illinois.

She said she wanted a ride in his convertible because she had never been in one before.

As soon as the car pulled away from her house, the woman said, McCullough, who was 22 and known as John Tessier then, became silent and had a menacing intensity.

'I knew I had made a terrible mistake, I knew I was in danger,' she testified.

Murdered: Maria Ridulph stoked national attention when she disappeared from Sycamore, Illinois in 1957

He drove her to a part of town she didn't know and brought her to his apartment.

There, he raped her on a dingy cot in a dark room. Then let his friends assault her, as well, the woman testified Tuesday.

McCullough's lawyer has dismissed the allegations as uncorroborated testimony based on one woman's account of something that happened five decades ago.

He said McCullough never had access to a red convertible.Â 

The defense also brought in a neighbor who said he never remembered McCullough bringing his sister to his apartment.

However, prosecutors claim McCullough has a history of abusing teenage girls.

They brought in a 45-year-old woman who said he raped her in 1982 when she was a 15-year-old runaway.

McCullough, then a police officer in a small town in Washington, let the girl and her friend stay at his girlfriend's apartment. One night, she says, he raped her while she slept on the couch.

He was arrested and pleaded guilty to illegal communication with the minor.

McCullough is still awaiting trial on the charges that he murdered Maria Ridulph.

The little girl's disappearance 57 years ago captured national attention, with former FBI director J Edgar Hoover and President Dwight Eisenhower demanding updates on the investigation, the Daily Beast reported.

Police arrested McCullough last year after an unused train ticket was discovered, which destroyed his alibi.
