Accident: Veteran ABC newswoman Barbara Walters fell at inauguration party

TV legend Barbara Walters will spend another day under observation in hospital today after falling over a step at the home of the British ambassador.

Miss Walters, 83, suffered a cut to her head, but was taken to hospital in Washington DC at the weekend 'out of an abundance of caution,’ according to ABC News’ spokesman.

And today, an ABC source told MailOnline: 'Barbara's doing fine, she's still under observation at hospital in Washington.'

The source said there would be an update on Barbara's condition on her TV show, The View, on Tuesday, confirming: 'Barbara won't be on The View tomorrow.'

The veteran journalist was in Washington to cover the second inauguration of President Barack Obama.

However, she tripped over a step at the residence of Britain’s U.S. ambassador, Sir Peter Westmacott.

ABC News spokesman Jeffrey Schneider said that the fall left Miss Walters with a cut on her forehead.

Mr Schneider said that 'out of an 
abundance of caution,' Miss Walters was taken to a hospital to get the cut
treated and to receive a full examination.

He added that Ms Walters is alert 'and telling everyone what to do,' which is 'a very positive sign.'

It's unclear when Ms Walters might be released from the hospital.

As it stands, Diane Sawyer and George Stephanopoulos will anchor the day’s events for the network.

Miss Walters was TV news' first female superstar, making headlines in 1976 as a network anchor with an unprecedented $1 million annual salary.

During more than three decades at ABC, and before that at NBC, her exclusive interviews with rulers, royalty and entertainers have brought her celebrity status.

In 1997, she created 'The View,' a live weekday talk show that became an unexpected hit.

Miss Walters had heart surgery in May 2010 but returned to active duty on 'The View' that September, declaring, 'I'm fine!'

Even in her ninth decade, the ever-active star continues to keep a busy schedule, including appearances on 'The View,' prime-time interviews and her annual special, '10 Most Fascinating People.'

During last December's special, she asked New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie if he considered himself fit enough to be president someday. (Gov. Christie, although acknowledging he is 'more than a little' overweight, replied he would be up to the job.)
