Regal and fierce, cats are the queens of the animal kingdom.

But few get to live in a palace like the one Greg Krueger has made for his four felines.

For 15 years, he has worked day and night building secret passageways, wall-mounted paths, slides and staircases that scale his home in Minnesota.

Wonderland: Greg Krueger's four cats spend their days scurrying around a 300ft playground in the house

The sprawling wonderland spans more than 300 feet, with a garden of plants growing catnip.

And he is still going.

Finally diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome last year, Krueger says his illness is a blessing for giving him the dedication to turn his imagination into reality.

'I just love trails and paths and cats - of course - so I've just linked those passions together,' he told CBS. 

'I think about it constantly, I can't fall asleep, I wake up thinking about it, I think about it all day at work.'

Passion: Mr Krueger, 49, says his Asperger's Syndrome has given him the drive to turn his dream into reality

He had always been passionate about the project but his diagnosis last year gave him the drive to embrace it. 

'Obviously my house would not be like this if I did not have Asperger's.

'It takes me a long time but I don't mind because I like what I'm doing.' 

He added: 'I don't feel like I live alone even though I'm the only person living here.'
