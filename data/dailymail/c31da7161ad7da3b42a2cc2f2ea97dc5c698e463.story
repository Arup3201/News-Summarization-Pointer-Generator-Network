Jurors who look up details of their case online should be prosecuted, the government’s top lawyer has warned.

Attorney General Dominic Grieve said members of juries must not try to find out about defendants by searching the internet.

And he wanted against trawling ‘chat and banter’ about cases on Facebook or Twitter or be charged with contempt of court.

Crackdown: Jurors are told not to search online for details of cases, and if they are caught trials can collapse at great cost to the taxpayer (file picture)

In a speech to think-tank Politeia, Mr Grieve QC backed plans by the Law Commission to create a criminal offence for jurors who intentionally seek information beyond the evidence presented in court.

It follows a number of cases in which jurors have been jailed for using the internet to find more information about cases than was set out in court.

Jurors have always been told by judges at the start of cases not to carry out their own research, discuss it with anyone, visit the scene of the crime or try to find out about the witnesses or defendants.

These directions now extend to not researching the case on the internet.

Dominic Grieve said members of juries must not try to find out about defendants by searching the internet and backed plans to make it a criminal offence

Mr Grieve said: ‘To ignore those directions, intentionally, amounts to a contempt of court. 

‘This does not mean that jurors must refrain from reading the news  - online or in the traditional way -, nor that they should not use the internet as they would normally.

‘It means that they must not seek out extraneous information about the case they have sworn to try in accordance with the evidence.’

He said there will be ‘all kinds of prejudicial information “out there” on the internet’.

‘This could be in the form of archived news reports about the defendant’s previous court appearances, or it could be, to use the words of the old authorities in a modern context, mere chaff and banter about the case on someone’s Facebook page or Twitter feed.

‘But the chances of a juror seeing such material are fairly slim, providing they haven’t gone looking for it.’

He highlighted the case of Theodora Dallas who was jailed for six months in 2012 after causing a trial to be stopped because she researched a defendant’s past on the internet.

The lecturer was a juror in the case of a man accused of grievous bodily harm, and after looking on the web discovered he had previously been acquitted of rape – information not given during his assault trial at Luton Crown Court.

Dallas shared her findings with her fellow jurors who informed the judge – and the trial of Barry Medlock, 64, a violent drinker, was halted.

At the time the Lord Chief Justice said: ‘The problem is not the internet: the potential problems arise from the activities of jurors who disregard the long established principles which underpin the right of every citizen to a fair trial.’

But Grieve said he endorsed the remarks, adding: ‘My recent experience is that the law of contempt is both adaptable and resilient in the face of the challenges of technology.

‘The fundamental principles underlying the need for juror restraint are timeless.’
