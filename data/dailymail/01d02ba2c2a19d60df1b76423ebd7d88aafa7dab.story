Rescuers have called off the search for a 65-year-old security guard who was swept off a pier at the Port of Mobile in high winds that also caused the Carnival Triumph, the 'cruise ship from hell,' to break free of her moorings and slam into other vessels.

Family members fear the worst for John 'Buster' Johnson, who was in a guard shack at the BAE Shipyard in Mobile, Alabama, when it was blown into the Mobile River on Tuesday afternoon.

Mr Johnson's co-worker, who was also in the shack at the time, was pulled from the water and taken to the hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.

Searchers believe they have picked up the small building on sonar about 20 feet below the water.

Still causing problems: The Carnival cruise ship Triumph sustained heavy damage when it was blow from its moorings in high winds at the BAE shipyard on Wednesday morning

'My understanding is he is classified as missing,' Disaster Relief Chaplain Tony Dickey told the Mobile Press-Register.

'The family understands under the 
circumstances that it is very probable that he is deceased. However, (Mr
Johnson's wife) asks that the community pray for those looking for her 
husband to find him and bring him home.'

Winds, gusting at up to 80 miles per hour, are being blamed for pulling the 900-foot-long Triumph from its dock and slamming it into nearby vessels and other structures.

One guard is currently missing in the River Mobile, while the other has been rescued.

Mobile
Fire Rescue said USAR has brought in search dogs to help find the 
missing person. A United States Coast Guard helicopter is also on site 
to help with any possible rescue mission.

County Metro Jail Warden Noah Price Oliver called 911 after hearing the
ship blow its warning horn several times and saw 'dozens of people 
scrambling around the ship,' reports AL.com.

A witness on the scene, Jim Smith, told Local 15 News that the ship broke loose and started to move out. He said
a tugboat attempted to bring the Triumph back in, but the tugboat got 
lodged between the Triumph and another ship.

Carnival spokesman Vance Gulliksen said 
the ship drifted and is now resting against a cargo vessel.

Carnival released this statement: ‘Due to strong winds in Mobile, Alabama, Carnival Triumph, which was docked at a Mobile shipyard, broke away from its moorings. The ship drifted and is currently resting against a cargo vessel. Tug boats and the U.S. Coast Guard are on site.’

The cruise ship was in Mobile undergoing repairs after trouble at sea that made international news and left passengers stranded in undesirable conditions for six day

The Triumph was towed into Mobile Bay
on Feb. 14, following a harrowing few days for the 4,229 passengers aboard
after an engine room fire Feb. 10 sent it adrift in the Gulf of Mexico.

Alabama State Port Authority 
officials agreed to accept the vessel, citing the size of the Port of 
Mobile, substantial dry-docking capabilities and ship repair expertise 
Carnival would have difficulty finding anywhere else.

Dry-docking services being performed 
by BAE Systems have been estimated to cost Carnival Cruise Lines a 
minimum of $5 million and could easily double – possibly triple – 
depending on the magnitude of work the Triumph requires.

The ship had been expected to sail again on June 3.

In February more than 4,000 passengers were trapped on-board the ill-fated Carnival cruise ship for six days after it lost power
