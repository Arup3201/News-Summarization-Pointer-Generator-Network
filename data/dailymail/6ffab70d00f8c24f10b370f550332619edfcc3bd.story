Internet retail giant Amazon is testing its drone delivery system at a secret site in British Columbia after becoming frustrated with US regulations.

The world's largest online store had wanted to test its Prime Air drones, which fly between 200 and 500 feet in the air, in Washington state but has now moved its research across the border, the Guardian reported.

Last week the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) gave Amazon permission to begin testing one particular type of drone that the company now says is obsolete because the technology is moving so quickly.

However, the company has already been testing in secret for the last several month at its own restricted airspace in Canada, about 2,000 from the border.

Amazon has been testing delivery drones at its British Columbia facility for several months after receiving a license for restricted airspace 2,000 feet from the US border in December

The online retailer had been granted an exemption for testing a prototype drone in rural Washington, though they say that the technology behind that application is already obsolete

The license went into effect on December 17, according to the CBC. 

FAA's regulations proposed earlier this year also state that the person controlling the drone must have constant sight of the robot.

The body has only approved 48 out of more than 750 exemption requests for exemptions that would allow outdoor drone testing before new guidelines are in place.

Amazon's applied last July but still does not have an exemption, as it has only received a 'experimental airworthiness certificate' for its previous prototype.

Oil giant BP was the first company to get approved for commercial drones over US land last year and drone pilots for the exemptions have been required to get pilot's licenses. 

The approval process includes nearly 100 pages of paperwork, a four hour presentation at FAA headquarters and a site visit.

Canada has fewer restrictions, essentially allowing Amazon do whatever testing they needed within their airspace, and only took three weeks to give the go ahead to the Seattle-based retailer's application.

The Federal Aviation Authority has only approved several dozen applications for drone testing licenses, though Canada has approved more than 1,600. Above, boxes that can be carried by drones

Amazon plans on creating a system that can deliver goods ordered online in less than 30 minutes. The FAA's proposed rules mandate that drones would have to be in the line of sight of their pilots at all times

Transport Canada, which has been giving out the licenses for almost a decade while the US just started last year, said that is aims to complete applications in 20 working days.

'In Canada, it's mostly about safety,' University of Toronto drone researcher Angela Schoellig said. 'If you show that you know what you are doing, it's very likely that you'll get a licence.'

Amazon is developing small aerial vehicles as part of Amazon Prime Air.

The aircraft can travel at more than 50mph and carry loads of up to 5 pounds. 

About 86 percent of Amazon's deliveries are 5 pounds or less, the company said.

'We believe customers will love it, and we are committed to making Prime Air available to customers worldwide as soon as we are permitted to do so,' the company has said previously..

It expects to eventually be able to deliver goods to customers within 30 minutes of online orders. 

The US's northern neighbor has granted 1,672 drone testing applications. 

'Different laws and regulatory structures in other nations may allow them to act more quickly to approve certain UAS [drone] operations,' an FAA spokesman said of the Guardian's report. 

The agency's representative said the authority is 'safety-oriented' and approval is based on 'assessment of the risks to other aircraft and to people and property on the ground'.

The FAA is expected to vote on its proposed drone rules by the end of the year.

Amazon hopes that it's Canadian testing will help build a system that allows customers to have goods delivered to their homes within 30 minutes of ordering them online.

It is working on high autonomous robots less than 55lbs that can carry objects less than 5lbs, the vast majority of the items Amazon ships. 

The company also has research outposts in Cambridge, UK, and Israel. 

FAA proposed rules also state that drones cannot operate over people not involved with them and cannot fly at night.

Pilot's licenses and airworthiness certificates will not be required.
