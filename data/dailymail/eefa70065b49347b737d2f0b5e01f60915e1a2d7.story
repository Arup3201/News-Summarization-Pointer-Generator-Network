Dog-mad Ms Furtado, from Massachusetts, US, was inspired to launch her canine couture after knitting her adopted pug called James Dean a hat to keep him warm through cold winters.

The Snuggly Pug Alien hat was such a hit with fellow pug owners she founded her company All You Need is Pug while still studying for her university degree. She now sells the hats for between £11 and £20.

Ms Furtado said: 'During the winter our clothing provides warmth and comfort especially for pugs, bulldogs, Boston terriers and other breeds whose bodies are low to the ground.

'Pugs in particular are sensitive to extreme heat and extreme cold so they require their owners to be aware of the weather and to take precautions.

'Pet owners have also used our hats to protect dogs with chronic ear infections from feeling pain in the cold.

'Frigid conditions can aggravate dogs whose ears are already raw from rash or infection, so the hats act as a shield to keep the cold from stinging.

'All You Need is Pug items are handmade from quality acrylic yarns, so they are warm and washable without being itchy.

'I don't think that only humans should have the privilege of masquerading each day in clothing.

Stylish: The fashion range also includes stylish knitted bow ties, French berets and neck warmers (left) along with some more unusual pieces, such as this Minnie Mouse hat (right)

'Our clothing says something about each of us.

'Many of my items are inspired by animals, acting as costumes that can transform your pet from a dog into a wild fox or a little piglet.

'Other hats are inspired by history and fashion, such as the iconic aviator helmet or the cabbie cap which resembles old fashioned "newsboy" hats.

'In my experience, most dogs enjoy dressing up now and then whether it is because they feel comfortable or because they notice the doting attention that they receive from humans when they wear clothing.'
