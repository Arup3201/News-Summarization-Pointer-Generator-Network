A hiker has been rescued after spending three days stranded with her two dogs in the wilderness, surviving on just wild mushrooms and bark.

Restaurant manager Paula Reuter, 21, from Seattle was picked up in the Snoqualmie Pass, Washington, by helicopter on Thursday after putting up smoke signals when she got lost.

With temperatures plummeting to 4C (40f) and only wearing a skirt, she moved around for two days in a desperate bid to get back onto the hiking trail, but kept heading deeper into the forest.

So she ended up staying put in an area surrounded by dry brush which was not covered in fog in the morning and used her lighter to start a fire.

There she was eventually spotted by rescue teams near an area called Pratt Ridge, a spot known for people getting lost.

Air patrols had been out searching for her since she had been reported missing on Tuesday. 

After receiving routine checks in hospital, she told King 5 News:  'I had a really good spot. It wasn't getting foggy in the morning, tons of dry brush around. I had seen the helicopter and I had my smoke signals out and I knew something was going to happen.'

After she was airlifted from the woods and taken to a safe location, she has a tearful reunion with her parents.

Reuter was last heard from on Monday and was reported missing on Tuesday night. She was last noticed when she posted a photo of the hills on Instagram.
