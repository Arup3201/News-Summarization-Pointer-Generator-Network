Militants fighting for the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq have issued a new set of rules jihadis must live by - including restrictions on when to utter curses and a ban on women slapping their thighs.

A fighter calling himself Abu 'Umar al-Masri, who claims to be based in the terrorists' capital Raqqa, tweeted photographs of flyers containing fatwas imposed on local residents in recent weeks.

Providing a unique glimpse in to life under ISIS' brutal and oppressive control, each of the 32 slips of paper - which are headed with the terror group's chilling black and white logo - gives a detailed explanation of various bizarre rules and regulations laid out by ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

Among the more unusual commands are orders that men must refrain from swearing while playing billiards or table football, and information on exactly when it is permitted for women dye their eyebrows blonde or carry assault rifles beneath their niqabs.

Dictats: Each of the 32 slips of paper - which are headed with the terror group's chilling black and white logo - gives a detailed explanation of various bizarre rules and regulations laid out by ISIS

Each of the 32 paper fatwas seen in Abu 'Umar al-Masri's tweets last month are numbered and dated, and are written in Arabic. It is understood the 32 fatwas are taken from approximately 70 new rules and regulations issued by the Islamic State in 2015.

The letters are written in Arabic and address the city's population, which terror analysis website Jihadica claims proves they are meant for local use, not wider propaganda purposes.

The fatwas are unlikely to have been issued by any body other than ISIS' official Sharia Council, to whom even leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi reports. Jihadica claims that this means 30-year-old Bahraini scholar and council leader Turki al-Bin'ali is the likely author.

Abu 'Umar al-Masri's tweets show that the list of new rules have been issued in a kind of stapled book and are structured in a question and answer format.

Although they pieces of paper are dated using an official Islamic State calender, Jihadica converted the dates to show that they were issued to citizens between December and February this year.

Oppressed: Among the more unusual legal explantions is information on exactly when it is permitted for women living under ISIS to dye their eyebrows blonde or carry assault rifles beneath their niqabs

Horror: At times the fatwas make harrowing reading, such as the rule justifying jihadis burning 'unbelievers' to death because the Prophet Mohammed ordered his enemies' eyes to be gouged out with hot iron

The fatwas issued by the Islamic State are highly bureaucratic, demanding fighters hand over one fifth of all money and items looted to the terror group's officials, insisting fighters cannot leave territory under ISIS control under any circumstances, and banning women from showing their eyes.

At times they make for harrowing reading, such as the rule justifying jihadis burning 'unbelievers' to death because the Prophet Mohammed ordered his enemies' eyes to be gouged out with hot irons.

The bulk of the fatwas deal with administrative matters, such as when citizens are due compensation,  how women should ensure they are dressed, and explaining the incredibly strict terms and conditions under which seriously ill women can visit a male doctor.

Despite rumours to the contrary having circulated for many months, they fatwas clearly state that the issuing of Islamic State passports is  banned as they enable citizens to 'travel to the lands of disbelief' - something expressly forbidden in an earlier dictat.

On a lighter note, both billiards and table football are allowed  - albeit under strict conditions and with a warning that God does not look particularity favourably on such trivial pursuits. 

Gambling on matches is, predictably, banned, but so is using table football characters shaped like humans, as the creation of anything imitating humans or animals is banned under ISIS' exceptionally strict interpretation of Islamic law.

One chilling fatwa appears to confirm reports that ISIS operates an organ harvesting scheme.

'It is permissible to transplant the healthy organs of the body of an apostate to the body of a Muslim, in order to save the latter's life or improve his condition if he has lost organs,' the letter states

'The jurists of the Shafi'i and Hanbali schools of Islamic law, among others, permitted killing belligerent unbelievers or apostates and eating their flesh as a life-saving measure. The case of organ transplantation as a life-saving measure is similar,' it adds. 

'Moreover, it is established that the lives and organs of apostates are fundamentally licit. Their organs may thus be taken, whether or not the apostates are alive or already dead, and whether or not doing so results in their death,' it goes on to claim.

AK-47 assault rifles, one fatwa insists, are perfectly acceptable to be carried beneath a women's clothes, providing it doesn't add definition to her body that could be deemed tempting to men. 

Likewise all forms of Western clothing are banned in order not to 'imitate the unbeliever', although the fatwas still feel the need to say it is illegal to sell counterfeit brand-name clothing and household products, as selling fake produce is a form of deceit.

One surprising law bans the practice of men swapping sisters or daughters for brides of their own, apparently because it 'does an injustice to the bride'. Instead, ISIS demand, the bride must grant permission for any marriage to take place.

The Islamic State cherry picks sections of the Koran and misinterprets the accounts of the Prophet Muhammad in order to wage jihad and sign up new recruits, experts say.

It is estimated that 20,000 people have streamed into the territory in Iraq and Syria, where ISIS has proclaimed what it calls a 'caliphate', ruled by its often brutal version of Islamic law.

The group purport to recreate the conquests and rule of the Prophet Muhammad and his successors and maintains its worst brutalities - such as beheading captives - only prove its purity in following what it contends is the prophet's example.

But now Muslims clerics and other experts are speaking out, saying that the group hand picks what it wants from Islam's holy book, the Koran, and from accounts of Muhammad's actions and sayings, known as the Hadith.

An ISIS member parades through the streets of Raqqa in Syria waving an Islamic State flag and brandishing a gun. Experts have now said that ISIS misinterprets the Koran in order to wage jihad 

It then misinterprets many of these, while ignoring everything in the texts that contradicts those hand-picked selections.

Writings by the group's clerics and its English-language online magazine, Dabiq, are full of citations from Koranic verses, the Hadith and centuries of interpreters, mostly from hardliners.

But Joas Wagemakers, an assistant professor of Islamic Studies at Radboud University in the Netherlands, says these are taken far out of context by ISIS.

He explained that Muslim scholars throughout history have used texts in a 'decontextualised way' to suit their purposes and says that ISIS represent the extreme.

He added: 'It would be a mistake to conclude the Islamic State group's extremism is the true Islam that emerges from the Koran and Hadith.
