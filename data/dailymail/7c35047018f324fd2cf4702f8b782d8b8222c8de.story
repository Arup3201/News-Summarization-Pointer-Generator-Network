Manchester United suffered a setback in the race for the top four after they lost to rivals Southampton last weekend.

Fortunately for Louis van Gaal, United are blessed with plenty of cash they could spend on reinforcements in the January transfer window. 

Having already spent £150million last summer on mostly attacking talent, United's defence remains a cause for concern. Here Sportsmail looks at the targets they could sign.

Aymeric Laporte (Athletic Bilbao)

The 20-year-old Frenchman is a great athlete but still raw. As with Ander Herrera, Bilbao will only consider a deal at buy-out clause level, which is understood to be £32m after a contract revision last June. That represents a big gamble for such a young player.

However, Laporte has impressed this season for Bilbao, making 3.9 interceptions per game  - the second highest in La Liga. 

And former Bilbao manager Marcelo Bielsa certainly rates Laporte highly, tweeting: 'Laporte is a great player, with lots of qualities. I can't remember a fault that I could tell you.' 

Joao Miranda (Atletico Madrid)

Atletico need money to service growing debts and will listen to bids but would prefer to sell in the summer. 

Brazilian centre-back Miranda is 30 and would cost £23m due to a reported release clause in his contract. Team-mates Diego Godin and Jose Gimenez are younger and represent better value for United.

The emergence of 19-year-old Gimenez this season has possibly convinced Atletico that now is the right time to sell Miranda. 

Convincing him to leave Madrid may prove difficult, however. 

'Staying at Atleti was the best for me and my family. I’m very happy to be at Atleti. I love Madrid and this is a great club,' he said when linked with a move away last summer. 

Mats Hummels (Borussia Dortmund)

Dortmund are in crisis, joint bottom of the Bundesliga after 17 games, and selling their captain would be a disaster on and off the pitch. 

His father Hermann says there is no deal to be done but some would argue Hummels' form hasn't helped their plight and £35m is a lot to turn down. Let's not forget that Dortmund are a club accustomed to losing their best players annually and have seen the likes of Nuri Sahin, Shinji Kagawa, Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski leave in consecutive seasons. 

Asked about his future on Monday, Hummels was somewhat ambiguous. 

'I have always decided not to leave. I think I have made some good decisions and I want to make those in the future as well,' Hummels told Sky Sports News. 

'I have never said I will stay until 2024 or 2030 or whenever. But I have stayed until today. I will stick to my way of not promising anything and maybe leave someday instead of saying I will stay forever and then leave all of a sudden.'

Seamus Coleman (Everton)

Roberto Martinez has insisted none of his players are for sale but offers above £25m would make Everton think. 

United want a right back but Chelsea also have a long-standing interest in Coleman and would rival any offer.

Coleman would be comfortable at right back or wing back in Van Gaal's preferred 3-5-2 formation and is a proven Premier League performer who could instantly step in and improve United's creaking defence. 

Ron Vlaar (Aston Villa)

Throw enough money at it and this is a deal that could be done this month. But United have shown no inclination so far to sign the 29-year-old who is out of contract in the summer. 

The central defender has suffered a spate of injuries restricting him to just 12 appearances for Villa this season and is currently out for at least a month with a knee injury. This a concern for United who have suffered their own run of defensive injuries. 

Vlaar, however, was a part of Van Gaal's Holland squad during the World Cup and certainly impressed his manager. 

'He was the most important defender for Holland and he is always stable which is important. I was very happy with him,' he said. 

Nicolas Otamendi (Valencia)

The 26-year-old centre-back is a tough, warrior-type defender and Argentina international who United watched while at Porto last season. 

Otamendi has been a mainstay of Valencia' defence this season, playing 18 times and scoring the winner against Real Madrid earlier this month. He can also play right back - a bonus for Van Gaal who likes his players to be tactically flexible.  

Otamendi also reportedly has a close relationship with international team-mate Angel di Maria which may help any potential move, though his £40m buyout clause could prove prohibitive.
