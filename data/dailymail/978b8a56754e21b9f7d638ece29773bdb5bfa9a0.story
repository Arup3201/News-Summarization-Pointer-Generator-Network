If you dream of living on a houseboat or barge but can't imagine giving up some of your mod cons, this floating home may be the answer.

The solar-powered Water Nest 100 can be placed on any lake or river and is completely powered by solar energy. 

It was developed for London-based EcoFloLife by Italian architect Giancarlo Zema and has enough space to accommodate a family of four with two bedrooms.

The largest model of the circular house measures 39 ft (12 metres) in diameter and 13 ft (4 metres) tall, with 1,076 square feet (100 square metres) of floor space plus balconies. 

Other homes can be made to order in both 649 square feet (60 square metre) and 861 square feet (80 square metre) versions. 

Mr Zema said: 'The inspiration came from observing the water nests of water birds about the globe in which they can reside and increase their young children in comprehensive harmony with nature.'

The floating home (pictured) is made out of locally sourced material and up to 98% water-resistant recycled supplies.  Bathroom and kitchen skylights are located on the wooden roof, as are 649 square feet (60 square metres) of amorphous photovoltaic panels capable of generating 4 kilowatts per hour. The designer said this is enough energy to power all the home's appliances and lights

The Salsa Box mini home is made by Oregon-based Shelter Wise, and costs $22,500 (£151,000)

It has a living roof, and a fold-down window box to grow herbs and vegetables. 

It was originally built as an instructional model to give workshop students a clear look at each of the steps involved in building a Tiny Home.

However, Shelter Wise said the design was so popular it decided to start selling it. 

The floating habitat is made out of locally sourced material and up to 98 per cent recycled supplies, including recycled glued laminated timber and a recycled aluminium hull - all of which are completely water resistant. 

In addition, internal natural micro-ventilation and air conditioning means it can be classified as 'a low-consumption' home. 

Bathroom and kitchen skylights are located on the wooden roof, as are 649 square feet (60 square metres) of amorphous photovoltaic panels capable of generating 4 kilowatts per hour - enough energy to power all the home's appliances, claims the designer.
