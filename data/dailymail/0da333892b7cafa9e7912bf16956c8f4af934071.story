Keith says he remembers riding his bicycle through the stricken neighborhoods.

Speaking to CNNâ€™s Anderson Cooper by phone from Nashville, Tennessee, Keith said: 'Itâ€™s devastating.'

He added that the number of casualties could have been much higher had it not been for the vigilance of forecasters.

'Oklahoma's really good. Great meteorologists. Have great weather centers and they prepare you for this. The numbers could be much much higher.'

Rescuers are still working to pull people from the rubble in the community that's southwest of Oklahoma City.

At least 91 people are confirmed dead, and more than 200 have been injured.

The giant twister roared through the Oklahoma City suburb obliterating entire neighborhoods and pulverizing a 30-square-mile stretch with winds up to 200 mph.

Block after block lay in ruins. Homes were crushed into piles of broken
 wood. Cars and trucks were left crumpled on the roadside.

In a statement, Keith said: 'This storm has devastated the community that I grew up in. I rode my bike through those neighborhoods. I have family and friends in Moore.

'My heart and prayers go to those that have lost so much. But Moore is strong and we will persevere. God be with you all.'
