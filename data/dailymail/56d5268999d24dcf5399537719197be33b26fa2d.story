With his World Championships race just hours away, he is undoubtedly feeling the pressure.

But on Tuesday, Olympic ski champion Bode Miller's pregnant wife and two-year-old son - who has a different mother - helped to take any worries away as they joined him at a men's training session.

Bode's spouse, Morgan Beck-Miller, who is six months' pregnant with her first child, was pictured donning a designer jacket, sunglasses and a striped top at the event in Beaver Creek, Colorado.

She was also sporting a noticeable baby bump under her top as she carried Bode's young son, Sam - whom he had with ex-girlfriend, Sara McKenna - across the snow to watch his father train.

At one point, Morgan, a 27-year-old professional volleyball player and model, was seen kissing her husband, who recently cleared himself for the race after suffering from back problems, on the lips.

The trio were joined at the slopes by Tiger Woods, who was cheering on his girlfriend Lindsey Vonn in the FIS Alpine World Ski Championships Women's Super G, which took place on Tuesday.

Woods, donning a black jacket, shades and a black hat, lost his tooth the last time he watched his partner compete in a race after a photographer apparently hit him with a camera in Italy.

In this year's World Championships, Bode, a six-time Olympic medalist, may also compete in the super-combined event. However, US men's coach Sasha Rearick has not yet confirmed this.

On Tuesday, Bode, who also has a six-year-old daughter with ex-girlfriend Chanel Johnson, clocked the 12th fastest time during the downhill training event at the Birds of Prey racecourse.

Speaking to reporters, the 37-year-old athlete said: 'I am going to start in Super-G tomorrow. The first training run you keep your eyes open and see where there is potential to make up more speed.

'A couple of little mistakes that are easy to clean up. My body felt fine.'

The event will be Bode's first competitive race since last March, when he failed to finish the second leg of a slalom contest in Switzerland.

Last month, Morgan shared a photo of her growing baby bump on the social media platform Instagram, alongside the caption: '6 months, 28 lbs and an amazing appetite. This isn't so bad.'

In the comments section, she added she and Bode have decided not to find out the sex of the baby before it is born. 'It's going to be a surprise!' she wrote. 'It's so hard for me not knowing though.'

Morgan (pictured with her husband) has revealed that she and Bode have decided not to find out the sex of the baby before it is born. 'It's going to be a surprise!' she wrote. 'It's so hard for me not knowing though'

The post came just weeks after Morgan suggested that Sara became pregnant with Bode's son by 'taking a condom out of the trash'.

In an anonymous November post on TheBump.com, she wrote: 'Girls do crazy things for money... including taking condoms out of trash cans and locking themselves in a bathroom.'

But when readers became aware of her identity, the image and posts were promptly removed.

Sara and Bode were involved in litigation over custody of their young son since his birth, with the case only being settled at the end of last year, though details have not been made public.

Drama: In November, Morgan accused Bode's ex Sara McKenna (left) of getting pregnant with their son (pictured with Morgan, right) by taking a 'condom out of the trash'. Sara has dismissed Morgan's claims

Sara dismissed Morgan's claims about how she got pregnant, saying: 'Sam was conceived the old fashioned way while we were on vacation in Florida.'

She later added: #'This Morgan thing has been getting a little out of control and downright scary and I would like it to stop.'

Morgan and Bode met in 2012 just months after he began dating Sara, and were married in October 2012. In early 2013, Beck suffered a miscarriage, just one month before Sara gave birth.
