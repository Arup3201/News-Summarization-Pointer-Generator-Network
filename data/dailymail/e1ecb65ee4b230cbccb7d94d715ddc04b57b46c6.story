Peter Foster was sentenced to three years' prison for his forbidden role in the weight loss industry

Conman Peter Foster who was today still on the run from a jail sentence, has told a judge in a rambling letter that he is ‘tired’ of being Peter Foster and just wants ‘peace and quite in my life, or if not in this life, the next one.’

A day after Justice John Logan sentenced Foster to three years jail for criminal contempt of court the whereabouts of the 51-year-old self-styled international man of mystery remained just that - a mystery.

But today the contents of a letter he sent to Justice Logan in the Supreme Court in Brisbane were revealed - and it contained a suggestion that he had contemplated suicide because of the official hounding he had received for his forbidden involvement in the weight loss industry.

Foster, the central figure in the infamous 2002 Cheriegate scandal, when Prime Minister Tony Blair’s wife Cherie used him to buy two discounted flats in Bristol, wrote: ‘If I sound like I have had a gut full it is because I have.

‘If it wasn’t for my mother and her dependence upon me at this time of her life, I doubt I would have lasted this long.

‘As it is, I would happily follow in the steps of British fashion designer Alexander McQueen, who thought that life was pointless after the passing of his mother, who had been his rock.’

Foster said in the letter that he had not turned up for his sentencing because he thought the hearing was to be at a different date.

The late fashion designer Alexander McQueen and his mother. In the letter Mr Foster said: 'I would happily follow in the steps of British fashion designer Alexander McQueen, who thought that life was pointless after the passing of his mother, who had been his rock'

He has been found guilty of breaching a
2005 Federal Court order not to be involved in any way in the weight 
loss industry for five years, but he breached the order when he began 
promoting SensaSlim, a weight-loss nasal spray between December 2009 and
September 2010.

The 
Australian Competition and Consumer Commission took him to court, but in
the letter released today Foster said the commission’s pursuit of him 
was ‘vicious and malicious.’

Judge
Logan, acknowledging that Foster was ‘intelligent and eloquent, but…has
directed that to unlawful acts’, read how the conman had likened his 
treatment to a rugby foul.

In 2002, it was alleged but later denied
that Cherie Blair, the wife of British prime minister Tony, bought two 
flats with the assistance of Peter Foster, a convicted Australian conman

Foster
wrote: ‘The offence is that a matter of months before the ending of the
five-year ban I had diligently complied with, I allegedly put my toe 
from the touch line into the field of play

‘It
reminds me of the rugby league analogy of the video referee and if you 
look at something closely enough, slowly enough, often enough, you will 
come up with one determination that half the country agrees with and the
(other) half of (the) country doesn’t.

‘The
allegations against me has been looked at in such slow motion, and at 
such a microscopic snail’s pace, but I do not concede that I 
intentionally and knowingly was in contempt of the court order.

‘I
thought, and I still believe, that my actions were not that I stepped 
into the field of play, but was watching, even shouting support from the
sidelines.

'But I wasn’t on the field and I never got to touch the ball.’

In 2002, it was alleged but 
later denied that Cherie Blair, the wife of prime minister Tony, bought 
two flats with the assistance of Peter Foster, a convicted Australian 
conman.

A boyfriend of her friend, Carole Caplin, he allegedly negotiated a discount for Mrs Blair on the properties.

She later apologised for the connection in an address on live television.

The
prime minister's wife choked back tears live on air and asked for 
understanding over her dealings with Foster, saying: 'I'm not 
Superwoman.'
