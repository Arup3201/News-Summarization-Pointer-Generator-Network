Former Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler showed he hasn’t lost his touch as he attempted the crossbar challenge on Monday.

Fowler is in Boston with the Anfield club as they continue their pre-season preparations.

And he clipped the bar with a shot from the halfway line to show the younger players how its done.

Going: He hit one from the halfway line

Going: It looked good as it travelled...

Pleased: And he looks happy celebrating his hit

The Liverpool legend, who scored 183 goals for the club over two spells, has recently been named as an ambassador for the club.

'Liverpool has been a massive part of my life for 30 years now,' he told the club website.

'It’s been an honour to play for this club and it’s even more of a privilege to be asked to be an ambassador.

'I’m looking forward to representing this great club and will do all I can to support success both on and off the pitch.'
