Sheriff's in Putnam County, Georgia, investigating the disappearance of an Eatonton woman and the gruesome murder of her husband have said the Mafia was not involved and neither were in witness protection.

One week after 88-year-old Russell Dermond's decapitated body was found in the garage of his $1 million lakefront home, his 87-year-old wife Shirley Dermond is still missing.

Putnam Sheriff Howard Sills said that despite unfounded rumors of organized crime involvement, they are no closer to finding a motive for the murder and are confident that Mrs. Dermond will he found alive.

Quiet area: Sheriff Howard Sills said there hasn't been a break-in in the gated, guarded community for 18 years, and the Dermond's home bore no signs of forced entry or struggle

'I’m running down one thing after another and coming up empty,' Sills said Tuesday according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution.

Sills added that there was no evidence that the mob had anything to do with the murder and disappearance.

'No, the man wasn’t in witness protection,' he said. 'He wasn’t going to testify. There’s no evidence of any kind of torture.'

Investigators believe Russell Dermond’s head, yet to be recovered, was severed after he was killed. 

On Tuesday the Department of Natural Resources used a submarine to search the bottom of the peninsula off of Lake Oconee near to their Reynold's Plantation home.

So far they have only found a ladder.

Friends of Russell and Shirley Dermond found the body of 88-year-old Russell Dermond in the garage of the $1million home Tuesday and called the police, Putnam County Sheriff Howard Sills said. They went looking after not hearing from the couple for days.

Lakeside idyll: The Dermonds lived quietly in their waterfront home and were described by their pastor as a 'sweet' and 'unassuming' couple

Unexplained: Police believe the perpetrator may have accessed the Dermonds' home by the water and that the attack was isolated and premeditated

County coroner Gary P. McElhenney said that the man had been decapitated. Police believe the attack happened sometime between Friday and Sunday, Sills said.

Shirley Dermond, 87, was not at the home when authorities arrived at the home in the Great Waters and investigators believe she may have been abducted.

'I do not believe this to be a random attack and I base that on several things,' Sills told WSB-TV. 'No evidence of forced entry or struggle or things like that.'

Shirley Dermond is described as five feet two inches tall and 148 pounds. She has gray hair and blue eyes. She is not considered a suspect in her husband’s death, Sills said.

The bizarre attack has detectives baffled and police are deeply concerned for the safety of Shirley Dermond.

Nothing appeared to have been stolen from the home, with the couple's cell phones, cars and other valuable items found still in the home.

'I'm not optimistic given the fact of her husband's circumstances, holding out hope for the family,' Sills said.

'We still approach this as if she's been abducted and we pray that she is alive but we don't know anything about where Ms. Dermond is.'

Sills said it's very difficult to track where Shirley Dermond might have gone since her cell phone, wallet and car were all left behind.

Concern: Neighbors became worried after not seeing the couple for days and discovered the headless body of Russell Dermond in the garage and Shirley Dermond missing

No weapon was recovered from the attack.

The couple's children have traveled to their home while police investigate.

One of the the Dermonds' sons, Bradley Dermond, described his parents Wednesday as 'salt of the Earth.'

'This absolutely makes no sense at all,' he told USA Today. 'We're still hoping that our mother is OK.'

Sills added that authorities are investigating whether the attacker may have approached the couple’s home from the lake.

'This is a huge lake,' he said. 'It spans four counties and entry could’ve been made by the lake.'

The home is located in the gated Great Waters community on Lake Oconee, a guarded, gated community with no public access.

According to 2013 tax records the couple's home, boat dock and land is worth $1,043,094.

The Dermond's move to the home from Atlanta after he retired. He used to own fast food franchises. Neither of the couple had any history of mental illness nor known health problems.

The couple has three children, two sons and a daughter, all of whom live out of state and are cooperating with investigators. The last contact any of the children had with their parents was April 29th.

Sills told Channel 2 that there hasn't been a home invasion in the area for 18 years.

The Dermonds' neighbors are shocked that such a violent crime had been committed against the couple.

'We were all in shock and we really just don't know how they'd have any enemies or anybody who'd want to do anything to them,' the Reverend David Key of Oconee Lake Community Church told USA Today.

'They're the last couple that you would think anybody would break in and do this kind of violence to.'
