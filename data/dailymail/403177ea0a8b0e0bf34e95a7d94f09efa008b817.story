Michael Strahan's fiancée Nicole Murphy has ended the couple's five year engagement.

The pair started dating in 2007 and the former New York Giants proposed two years later.

'They love each other very much, but with the distance and work schedule it has been hard to maintain the relationship,' a  spokesperson for Strahan told People magazine on Friday.

The 42-year-old's TV career has certainly increased of late.

The LIVE! With Kelly And Michael host took on a part-time role with Good Morning America in April, and besides that he continues to fly to Los Angeles on weekends to co-anchor Fox NFL Sunday before hopping aboard a red-eye flight back to New York in time for for his morning show gigs.

Strahan gets up bright and early at 4:30AM to hit the gym - the first of two daily workouts - before he walks to work amidst all the other foot travelers in the Big Apple.

As they were: Michael and Nicole made one of their last appearances as a couple at the 2014 Vanity Fair Oscar Party in LA on March 2 

The split comes just a day before Strahan will be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

The couple started their relationship in 2007 and two years later became engaged.

While Michael was wed twice before, Nicole was famously wed to funny man Eddie Murphy for 13 years until their divorce in 2006.

Nicole has 
five children with the Beverly Hills Cop star: daughters Bria, 24, 
Shayne, 19, Zola, 14, Bella, 12, and son Myles, nine.

Strahan
 was married first to Wanda Hutchins until their split in 1996; they 
share a daughter, Tanita, 22, and a son, Michael Jr., 19.

The
 former football star then wed Jean Muggli, with whom he has twin 
daughters Sophia and Isabella, 10, but the pair divorced acrimonously in
 2006.

Nicole was reticent to date someone so soon after her marriage to Eddie ended, but Strahan won her over with his charm.

'Michael and I talk about everything, and we both love to travel, explore and laugh,' Nicole told People in early 2008.

Strahan, meanwhile, is gearing up for Saturday's Pro Football Hall Of Fame induction and not without some jitters.

'I get nervous before FOX NFL Sunday, I get nervous before Live!, I get nervous before GMA. I get nervous before I brush my teeth,' Michael told the NY times.

'Everybody gets a little nervous. I'm no different than anyone else. I think the key is to shake that nervousness and turn it into production.'

Jitters: Michael, seen here with his GMA family on June 24, admitted to feeling a little nervous ahead of Saturday's Pro Football Hall Of Fame induction, adding, 'I get nervous before I brush my teeth'
