Normal programming has resumed. After three days of great respect between Australia and India, traditional hostilities, which have marked recent matches between the two nations, have resumed on day four of the first cricket Test after David Warner reacted to being bowled by a no-ball from young paceman Varun Aaron.

As the ball clattered into the stumps, Aaron celebrated by yelling out 'c'mon!' to his team-mates.

But a review of the dismissal found he had over-stepped and the umpires called Warner back to the middle. The first innings centurion looked directly at the fast bowler and mouthed 'c'mon' on several occasions.

Tempers flared, with non-striker Shane Watson also becoming involved as other Indian players chastised Warner for his reaction.

The umpires were forced to intervene and asked them all to cool down.

Let's calm down says Virat Kohli to Shane Watson after the Australian batsman exchanged heated words with some of the Indian fielders on day four

Peacemaker. India captain Virat Kohli does his best to diffuse the situation between David Warner and Varun Aaron at the Adelaide Oval

'C'mon'. David Warner has a mid-pitch discussion with Indian captain Virat Kohli after he was recalled on a no-ball dismissal by young paceman Varun Aaron

But Warner taunted the bowler again when he let the next ball pass through with another audible and sarcastic 'c'mon'.

With the Test on the line, both sides have been giving their all. Australia scored more than 100 runs in the second session with Warner leading the way, as the home team pushed to post a competitive lead going into the last day on Saturday.

Indian ire rose further when Warner appeared to be caught behind off Aaron immediately after the tea break, only for the appeal to be turned down. 

The in-their-face attitude was in stark contrast to Thursday's proceedings when Mitchell Johnson hit India's captain Virat Kohli on the helmet and the entire Australian side was visibly shaken.

The first Test of the summer was delayed and moved to Adelaide, instead of Brisbane, because of the tragic death of Australian opener Phillip Hughes.

This match has been dedicated to the late batsman, with a 63-second standing ovation featuring on day one along with the number 408 on both the Australians' shirts and on the ground. There have also been several touching tributes on the field of play but with a Test victory on the line, no quarter was asked nor given.

Mitchell Johnson was consoled by Australian captain Michael Clarke after striking his Indian counterpart with a short delivery. But the spirit of cricket has been tested on day four as both sides exchanged words in the middle

Earlier, off-spinner Nathan Lyon claimed his sixth five-wicket Test haul to bowl Australia into a handy lead.

Lyon captured five for 134 off 36 overs to help dismiss the tourists for 444 and trail Australia by 73 runs in the first innings.

India unravelled after resuming at 369 for five and lost five wickets for 75 on the fourth morning, with Lyon leading the way with his unpredictable turn out of the bowlers' footmarks.

Lyon, coming off an underwhelming series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates where he captured three Test wickets at an average of 140, thanked India paceman Ishant Sharma for creating demons in the Adelaide Oval pitch.

'It's pretty easy, we had big Ishant running down the middle of the wicket (in Australia's first innings),' Lyon said after Thursday's third day's play.

'I'm thankful for him making some footmarks. Hopefully, he does it the whole series.'
