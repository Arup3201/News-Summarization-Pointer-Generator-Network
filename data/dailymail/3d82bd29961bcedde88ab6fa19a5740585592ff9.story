A couple sent their children to a £32,000-a-year private school and rented a house for almost £2,000 a month while claiming £42,000 benefits, a jury was told today.

Sarah Grant, received a £40,000 payment from her parents and was drawing income as a director of three companies during the time she and husband Leslie, 67, were claiming benefits, Gloucester crown court heard.

The couple, of Cheltenham, claims the firms were in liquidation and deny falsely claiming pension credits, housing benefit and council tax benefit without declaring that they had other income.

Couple accused: Sarah and Leslie Grant allegedly sent their children to a £32,000-a-year private school and rented a house for almost £2,000 a month while claiming £42,000 benefits

Prosecutor Tara Wolfe told the court the couple had claimed a total of £42,500 to which they were not entitled.

'While they were in receipt of those benefits they were managing to continue to pay for their children to go to Dean Close School in Cheltenham and to continue to pay for expensive child care and expensive rent,' she said.

'We say they received £19,000 pension credit, £19,000 housing benefit and £4,500 council tax benefit to which they were not entitled.

'We say Mr and Mrs Grant knew they were under an obligation to inform the Department for Work and Pensions and the council of money coming into their accounts which affected their entitlement to benefits.

'The prosecution say they had income coming in from three sources. Between September 2010 and October 2011 Mrs Grant received £40,000 from her parents.

'There was also income from her position as a director of three limited companies that were trading during the material time and which Mr Grant was running.

'And they were using their business accounts for personal expenditure.

'Money from those accounts that was not being declared was being used to pay personal bills, for example their expensive rent and school fees as well as for more day to day things such as shopping.'

Top private school: The Grants' children attended £32,000-a-year Dean Close School in Cheltenham while the couple was claiming benefits, the court heard

The three active companies of which she was a director were Hadleigh Partnership, Hadleigh Developments and Sarafino Ltd, she said

The prosecutor said Mr Grant had been receiving pension credit from November 2007 yet he was running the companies of which his wife was director.

Investigations into their affairs began when questions were raised about how they were able to pay £1,950 a month rent while receiving housing allowance of only £775 a month, added Ms Wolfe.

Mrs Grant was questioned by a benefits official in May 2010 and said her parents had paid the rent shortfall and school fees. 

She claimed the money paid to her by the companies was to reimburse her for expenses she had paid for the businesses from her personal account.

Mrs Grant has held the position of director at eight different companies founded in the last seven years.

On trial: Speaking at Gloucester Crown Court (above), prosecutor Tara Wolfe told the court the couple had claimed a total of about £42,500 to which they were not entitled

As well as the three mentioned in court, she was associated with Carousel Group Cheltenham, Sarafinos Estates, Clayhills Development, The Belgian Chocolate Company and D'Altos.

All are now listed online as dissolved or in liquidation.

Mr Grant was seen in October 2011 and 'spoke a lot about bankruptcy proceedings and legal proceedings in respect of money owed to him,' added the prosecutor.

When they had filled out benefit application forms she had said she was a director but the companies were in liquidation. 

Both defendants, seen leaving court together side-by-side today, say the businesses were not a going concern and both said they did not work.

The trial continues tomorrow.
