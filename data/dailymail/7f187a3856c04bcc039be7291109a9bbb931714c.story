From Wyndham Lewis to L.S Lowry, the list of artists who have made it their business to offer a unique perspective on war is a long and distinguished one.

But there's one painter who has never had the recognition she deserves and, apart from her name, practically nothing is known about her.

Gladys E. Reed, a member of the WRNS during World War Two, spent her brief career documenting the work of her colleagues in a series of beautifully drawn sketches.

After the war, the images were given to the Royal Maritime Museum, and will go on display for the first time in 60 years in an exhibition that launches next week.

But despite her obvious talent, Ms Reed remains a mystery - one that the museum hopes to solve with the help of visitors.

'She wrote to the National Maritime 
Museum from Southsea in 1947, when she offered her drawings, but she 
gave no indication of what she was doing at the time, and after that we 
heard no more,' explains Dr Melanie Vandenbrouck, the museum's curator of art.

So what do we know about the UK's most enigmatic war artist. First that like most WRNS, she was childless and unmarried when she signed up.

Records show that she trained on HMS Cabbala with the 'Woolwich class' of January to July 1943 and that she served at shore base HMS Eaglet as a telegraph operator.

It is also known that it was while she serving in Liverpool that the 14 works held by the Royal Maritime Museum, their subjects ranging from telephonists to security details, were completed.

'The remarkable quality of her drawings suggests that she had an artistic training,' adds Dr Vandenbrouk.

'They are a rare eyewitness account of 
life in the WRNS during the Second World War. There were depictions of 
women’s wartime work, but these were usually commissioned by the 
government.

'Gladys Reed’s drawings are unusual because she was a Wren 
and shared the experiences of the women she depicted.

'As such, her 
sketches have a different feel to them, quite unlike the works done by 
official war artists, which would have been more staged, and used for 
propaganda.

'Reed did the drawings for herself and her fellow workers, in the 
hope, she said, that "they may reflect a little of that busy, happy 
atmosphere that did exist in the Wrens". They are more personal, and as 
such they feel very real and touching too.'

After the war, in May 1947, Reed, by then living on Eastern Villas Road in Southsea, began a correspondence with the 
Royal Naval College and the National Maritime Museum, with a 
view to presenting her wartime drawings. 

In
 her letters to the National Maritime Museum’s director, Frank Carr, she
 wrote that 'while serving in the WRNS during the war 
as a WT operator, [she] attempted to keep, in [her] off-watch time, a 
sketch record of some of the various interesting kinds of work being 
done by Wrens'.

For his part, Carr adored the 'delightful 
drawings' which 'we feel that these form a most useful: and, if I may 
say so, a most graceful record of the WRNS work in the war, so much more
 telling than photographs.

He added: 'We are trying to build a really good 
record for future generations: and I am sure that your sketches would 
interest and give pleasure to many in the years ahead.'

14 sketches duly arrived but more letters from Gladys did not. She simply disappeared, leaving only her drawings behind.

'We're in touch with the WRNS Association to see if 
someone knows or remembers her,' adds Dr Vandenbrouk.

'I would love to hear from anyone who 
might have clues as to what happened to her.'

The work of Gladys E. Reed will appear in War Artists at Sea, from 15th February at The Queen's House, Greenwich
