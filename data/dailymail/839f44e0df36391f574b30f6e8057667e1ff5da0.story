Charlotte Hutton: 'It gave me financial independence'

School leavers are to be urged to go straight into professional jobs as apprentices without getting a university degree.

Oxbridge-educated skills minister Matthew Hancock has announced schemes to throw open the doors of the professions to non-graduates so that teenagers can train as lawyers, accountants and insurance brokers.

He said youngsters who go straight from A-levels into training for high-flying City careers, can immediately receive a salary and many see a faster rise up the career ladder than graduates.

Mr Hancock, who holds degrees from both Oxford and Cambridge universities, and worked as a Bank of England economist before entering politics, said that if he was leaving school today and had the option of an apprenticeship 'I would have considered it'.

Auditors and accountants can now train straight from school at the professional services giant PricewaterhouseCoopers, while a law course for school leavers being designed with BPP, a chain of law schools in eight British cities, is set to begin in September.

A scheme for insurance professionals is already up and running which allows them to qualify in three years – a year ahead of their peers who do a three-year degree and then must do a year of on-the-job training afterwards.

Mr Hancock said: 'The idea is it will allow more people to think, at the age of 18, if I want to be a lawyer or an accountant I don't have to go to university to do it.

'Instead of three years of an undergraduate degree and a couple of years afterwards, you can qualify as a lawyer quicker and get paid for doing it.'

'We have started with these three professions but I see this as very much demand-driven and if any other professions come forward I'm all ears. These apprenticeships reflect the economy how it is now, not how it was 20 years ago.'

However, Professor Les Ebdon, director of the Government's Office for Fair Access, said intelligent, motivated students would be best off going to university.

Academic study, he told the BBC's PM programme, would broaden their horizons, hone their writing and debating skills and give them a professional network for life.

'We are trying our best to remove barriers,' he said. 'If you have the potential, you should look to university. It's the best career move you can make, and nobody regrets education.' Some professionals such as solicitors used to be able to do all their training on the job without taking a degree, although they still had to obtain professional qualifications. But such apprenticeship-style training was phased out several decades ago.

Around 500,000 young people a year become apprentices in careers such as engineering and construction. Britain's biggest firms such as BAE Systems and Rolls-Royce have large apprenticeship schemes.

But Mr Hancock said the aim was to broaden it out to white collar careers, with a £25million fund for professional apprenticeships set up by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills.

'I have nothing negative to say about university, you learn an awful lot there, but this gives 18-year-olds more options, and that's especially important to ensure everyone who is bright has a chance to access the professions,' he said.

'It's a paid job – that's an important principle. Apprenticeships not only mean people are paid while they are learning but they learn faster and learn very practical skills for that job, which raises morale for the apprentice and everyone in the workplace.'

Opportunities: Mr Hancock said a university education 'is not for everyone' but that all youngsters should have the chance to aim for 'valuable jobs' in areas such as a law, financial services and engineering

He said social mobility was the main 
aim of the scheme, but that apprentices could also be a good 'export 
market' as Britain has a strong professional services sector whose 
employees are sought after in emerging markets such as China, India and 
Brazil.

From next year firms including KPMG, Jaguar Land Rover, Capgemini, IBM and Microsoft are planning schemes.

Jane
Bolton, chief operating officer at the National Apprenticeship Service,
which delivers the schemes, said that in the past year increasing 
numbers of high-achieving school leavers have given up university places
for on the job training.

'I
recently visited apprentices at Rolls-Royce, one of whom gave up a 
place at Oxford to study maths,' she said. 'Another girl we had works 
for BAE Systems. She got great A-level grades and was destined for 
university but decided not to go.

'Apprenticeships
are no longer just for crafts and with the cost involved in going to 
university, and the attraction of being employed and earning money from 
the beginning, it is a  serious contender for some young people.'
