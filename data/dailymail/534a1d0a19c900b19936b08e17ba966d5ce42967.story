Duncan  Bannatyne, one of the richest men in the country, yesterday launched a bizarre attack on his ex-wife Joanne McCue, claiming she had financially crippled him in their divorce settlement.

The Dragon’s Den star, worth an estimated £430million, went so far as accusing his family of ‘gold-digging’ and said he would have to make redundancies in his businesses after she demanded £1,000 a day.

He also claimed he would no longer be able to support charities, and accused Miss McCue’s family of ‘taking food from the mouths of orphans’.

Complaint: Duncan Bannatyne took to Twitter to reveal that his divorce had been confirmed

The health club tycoon’s extraordinary
attack on Twitter came after he received final confirmation of their 
divorce. His claims could not be substantiated.

He said: ‘It is a sad time. People 
employed by me will be made redundant and I cannot continue supporting 
charities. I am not allowed to discuss the settlement but Joanne said 
she needed £1,000 a day.

‘I just feel like the family have 
taken food from the mouths of orphans in Romania to buy themselves new 
cars. There is nothing I can do about it.’ The couple, who married in 
2006 and split five years later, have two children – Emily, 13 and Tom, 
11.

When asked for a comment Miss McCue 
said: ‘I have never commented, but our children are 11 and 13 which 
demonstrates how long we have been together.’

Claim: The Dragon's Den star told a follower he did not have enough money to buy a local shop

Attack: He went on to claim that members of his family were 'gold digging' during the Twitter rant

Bannatyne, 63, has previously said the
divorce costs will force him to lay off 43 staff. Last night, it was 
confirmed that some jobs will be lost in his ‘new projects team’ 
although it is not known how many.

He added: ‘I am trying my best to 
save single parents from being made redundant and I’m doing everything I
can do to continue to support orphans in Romania.’

On Wednesday night he revealed on Twitter that he had received the certificate to dissolve his marriage.

He wrote: ‘I just received my Decree 
Absolute by email, isn’t that nice? #DivorcedForMoney by a 
#GoldDiggingFamily’. In conversation with another Twitter user, he 
added: ‘Have no spare cash & having to make staff redundent (sic) 
due to cost of divorce.’

He also wrote: ‘Just want the world to know what disgusting parasites they are.’

Last October, he was taken to hospital after a suspected heart attack, which he later blamed on the stress of his divorce.

A spokesman said: ‘A handful of 
redundancies were confined to the new projects team as Duncan 
consolidates the business in line with the cost of the divorce and 
market conditions.

Bannatyne funds several projects for 
children in Romania. Last year, the Sunday Times Rich List put his 
wealth at £430million but he is reported to have said that this is an 
overestimate. He has three other children with his first wife, Gail.
