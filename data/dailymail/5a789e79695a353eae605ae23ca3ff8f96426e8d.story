While the government is wrestling with its spending limits, Barack Obama doesn't appear to have the same worries.

The U.S. President generously left an 85 per cent tip on two sandwiches he bought for himself and Vice President Joe Biden at a Washington, DC restaurant yesterday, after taking a surprise stroll off White House grounds.

Obama paid $21.56 for lunch and left a $18.44 tip at Taylor Gourmet, as thousands of furloughed federal workers go without a paycheck during the government shutdown.

The president likes cookies: The president and VP grabbed sandwiches at Taylor Gourmet, one of many DC restaurants offering a special discount for government employees on furlough

New York Daily News reported Obama ordered the 'Race Street' sub, consisting of roasted turkey, prosciutto, pesto and fresh mozzarella.

Biden had the '9th Street Italian' sub with Genoa salami, capicola, prosciutto, and sharp provolone.

They also ordered two drinks at the Philadelphia-style sandwich shop which is offering furloughed federal employees a 10 per cent discount.

The
president used the opportunity to once again make a case for the 
Republican-controlled House to pass a short-term spending measure that 
would reopen the government without strings attached.

'This shutdown could be over today,' he said. 'We know there are votes for it in the House.'

The shutdown has furloughed 800,000 
federal employees since Tuesday and forced the government to roll back 
services from coast to coast.

House Republicans have refused to a new 
spending bill unless the measure contains language delaying or defunding
aspects of Obamacare.

Working lunch: During the outing, President Obama spoke with reporters about the hardships government workers face in a shutdown, and again asked for the House to vote on a short-term budget without demands

Obama also reacted to a news report yesterday that quoted an anonymous senior administration official as saying that the White House was 'winning' in the clash over the shutdown, and that the length of the shutdown 'doesn't really matter to us.'

'There's no winning when families don't have certainty about when they are going to get paid next,' he said in response to a reporter's question.

Brendan Buck, a spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner, tweeted a hopeful message:

'Common ground: John Boehner really likes Taylor Gourmet.'
