Arriving at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital two weeks ago for my long-awaited appointment, my mind was already on the pleasures I had planned for the next day.

This meeting with a gynaecologist had been in the diary for three months, so it was hardly urgent, and I had no reason to doubt I would be in good spirits for my son’s 22nd birthday celebrations 24 hours later.

Little did I know that within half an hour I would be emerging from the consultant’s office in a state of shock, having been through one of the most physically traumatic experiences of my life.

Far from the routine examination for uterine fibroids I had been led to expect, instead I was put through what amounted to an invasive surgical operation without an anaesthetic.

The procedure reduced me to a screaming, sobbing, quivering wreck and left me so wiped out I could barely get out of bed for five days.

It’s been a life-changing experience, leaving me feeling deeply vulnerable, and when I think back to the woman who’d sat calmly in the waiting room, it is as if she were a different person — someone who naively thought doctors would always act in her best interests.

The condition which had led me there was unpleasant — heavy bleeding caused by fibroids in my womb — but certainly not life-threatening. For women of my age (I am 58), this situation could almost be described as routine.

And when the doctor summoned me into her office with a broad smile I was once again reassured. ‘We’re just going to do a quick internal examination and you’ll be on your way,’ she told me. Then she paused and added: ‘Actually, while you’re here we should probably take a biopsy [to rule out cancer]. It will be a little bit uncomfortable, but there shouldn’t be any pain. Is that OK?’

Eager to help, I nodded, smiling. The first alarm bell rang when the nurse patted my shoulder and said: ‘Aren’t you brave? Some women can’t manage to have this done, so good for you.’

Puzzled, I decided the best policy was to keep smiling. But within five seconds of the procedure starting, a searing pain tore through my body.

What ensued was a procedure known as an endometrial biopsy, in which the lining of the uterus is cut and scraped away. The procedure itself is common, especially among menopausal women. I had been through something similar in the past, but for one crucial detail: in this instance, I was given no anaesthetic whatsoever.

Most of these procedures are done under general anaesthetic, with patients leaving hospital the same day. Some patients prefer to have an epidural, meaning they feel nothing from the waist down, but these are more complicated for the anaesthetist and generally take longer to recover from.

Hetty, pictured in 2011, was in so much pain during the procedure that she likened the experience to childbirth, judging her pain at a 9 on a 1-10 scale

Perhaps the quickest and cheapest option is to forego the anaesthetic altogether. And this is what happened to me.

It was a brutal experience. On a scale of one to ten, with ten being the pain of childbirth, I would rate it as a nine.

As the doctor took the biopsy, which involves cutting away part of the uterus lining, then scraped right into my uterus and ovaries (a procedure designed to reduce heavy bleeding), I was exploding in pain. All the while the nurse was whispering in my ear: ‘You’re doing well. So brave. Breathe deeply, it’s almost done.’

Only it was far from over. For a quarter of an hour I screamed, bawled and panted like a woman in labour. The experience was so similar, I pointed out to the nurse that precisely 22 years earlier I had been in labour with my son, Rex. ‘Well, it’s not as bad as that, is it?’ she said, still smiling.

In moments of extreme pain, time seems to stand still. A minute can seem like an hour. Then, just as I felt the agony would never end, the nurse said: ‘All done. I think you’ve earned a cup of coffee and a slice of cake.’

Dumbstruck, I left the room in a state of shock. Somehow I got home and fell into bed, spent.

For five days I was exhausted. My son’s birthday was a washout. Instead of being treated by me to a day out, he was to spend the next week looking after me.

As the days passed, as the shock retreated, anger took its place.

Why had it happened? What on earth would possess any clinician to put a patient through that sort of experience? Exactly why hadn’t I been offered any anaesthetic? I felt deceived and violated. Not only was it painful, it was brutally intimate. Normally a woman will be unconscious or anaesthetised to the point where she is blissfully unaware of the procedure. Yet I had felt every scrape and cut.

To me, it seemed that the doctor and nurse — quite a double act with their breezy compliments — had blatantly groomed me. I hadn’t even been asked to sign a consent form for the procedure.

Was I ‘brave’, to repeat their mantra? Not particularly. Stupid would be a more apt description, to fall for this con trick which persuaded me not to make a fuss.

Hetty Baynes, pictured last week, has said that given the horrific experience she had, she will be looking to get private health insurance in the future to prevent repeat experiences

During the five days of bed rest that followed, I had plenty of time to reflect on the reasons for my horrendous experience.

I also learned I am not alone. My best friend’s daughter recently had a similar experience during a procedure in which dye was passed through her fallopian tubes. Again, she suffered excruciating pain, and again the subject of an anaesthetic never even came up.

I also discovered that one woman who had an excruciating experience during a similar procedure to mine had taken the matter up with her MP, Lyn Brown, who raised the issue in the House of Commons. The MP said she’d been contacted by other women, all with horrifying stories.

But why would any doctor put a woman through this? It is hard to escape the conclusion that it is related to spending cutbacks.

Lying in bed, my mind wandered back to the nurse telling me so sweetly: ‘Most women aren’t able to do this.’ Presumably they pulled the plug on the procedure from the first agonising scrape.

Why didn’t I? Because, perversely, I just wanted it to be over. The appointment had been in the diary for three months and having come this far there seemed little logic in turning back. Again and again I was told the procedure was ‘almost done’, only for it to go on for another ten minutes.

In hindsight, I would have waited another year to have it done under anaesthetic, rather than endure that visceral pain.

Yet from the doctor’s perspective, this barbaric approach makes sense. The NHS is stretched to breaking point. If they can get away with treating me in half an hour, rather than booking out a hospital bed for an entire day and calling in the anaesthetist, then why not do it?

While it’s not clear whether this policy is directly affecting pain relief provision in hospitals, the Government has pledged to financially reward those that increase the number of procedures done as an outpatient without a general anaesthetic — including hysteroscopies.

I called my GP to seek advice. He was shocked at what had happened, advising me that it is a fundamental principle of medicine that the doctor should have stopped the moment I showed signs of being in severe distress.

That they did not amounts to malpractice, and I am giving serious consideration to my options. I do not want to sue the NHS for money — the last thing the system needs is another drain on its finances.

Yet I am determined this should not be allowed to continue. No matter what pressure doctors are under, they should not be allowed to hurt people like this.

Much as I love the NHS, I am certain this never would have happened to me had I been a private patient.

Because of this debacle I was unable to work for a week. Next month my latest acting project, opposite Sir Michael Gambon in the BBC adaptation of The Casual Vacancy, will be aired and I am as busy as ever. Taking time off is not an option.

And if this experience has taught me one thing it is that I need to get myself some private health insurance, and fast. The hard-working people of the NHS may be doing their level best but I, for one, have lost faith.

A spokesman for the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital said: ‘We want to provide the best quality care and patient experience possible and apologise for the fact Hetty feels we did not meet this.

‘We always try to avoid unnecessary surgery for every patient, as surgery carries risk. Obtaining an endometrial sample always takes place in the outpatient setting as part of the routine gynaecological consultation.’
