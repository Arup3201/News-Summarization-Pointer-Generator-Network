Tyson Fury's showdown with Dereck Chisora failed to live up to the hype surrounding the heavyweight bout but the victorious fighter never fails to entertain away from the ring.

Fury, who remains unbeaten after defeating Chisora at the weekend, has attempted to sing one of Elvis Presley's hit songs.

The 26-year-old sang Presley's In the Ghetto while being filmed by iFL TV following his victory against his rival.
