It was the car the defined the 1980s - and now fans of TV programme Knight Rider have their chance to own their own version of the black Pontiac Firebird that stole the show from star David Hasselhoff.

Although the replica is not one of the many cars that originally appeared in the show, it does come from Hasselhoff's personal collection after being given to the actor by its designer Jennifer Catano.

The completely road-legal car - which like its on-screen lookalike has been named KITT - is now up for sale for $15,000 through the California-based Julien's Auctions, with a current bid of $16,000 and a final sale estimate of $30,000 to $50,000.

Design: This replica version of KITT from Knight Rider is completely road-legal and can now be purchased by fans of the TV show for an estimated $30,000 to $50,000

Gift: Although the replica is not one of the four cars that originally appeared in the show, it does come from Hasselhoff's personal collection after being given to the actor by its designer Jennifer Catano

Detailed: The replica KITT even has a W-shaped steering wheel and vast quantities of flickering red and yellow LEDs for that added touch of authenticity

To give the replica KITT that added touch of authenticity, Catano installed Lamborghini-style scissor doors, a W-shaped steering wheel and vast quantities of flickering red and yellow LEDs on both the interior and the exterior.Â 

She even went as far as to load the V8 Firebird with more than 4,000 sound samples from the original TV show, which ensures KITT's famous 'personality' can be recalled at the touch of a button.

Catano presented the car to Hasselhoff in 2012 as a gift on his 60th birthday, with the vehicle subsequently taken on a Europe-wide tour.

It is currently on display at 
Newbridge Silverwares' Museum of Style Icons in County Kildare, Ireland 
until April 27, which means the new owner is unlikely to receive the 
vehicle until early next month.

The replica KITT is just one of many items Hasselhoff is currently selling through Julien's
 Auctions - with the rest of the collection including a life sized model
 of the actor wearing his famous red Baywatch swimming trunks, a 
Baywatch-themed pinball machine, and a Knight Rider golf buggy.

Hit: The original version of KITT was so popular that it regularly stole the Knight Rider television show from star David Hasselhoff in the 1980s

Drive: The Pontiac Firebird used in Knight Rider is a 'third generation' model (pictured) made for 10 years between 1982 and 1992

All of the items are expected to sell for tens of thousands of dollars.

If
 KITT fans are unable to match the final asking price at the auction, 
Catano has offered to build as many versions of the iconic car as are 
ordered.

She said the 
estimated cost of any future build would be anywhere between $30,000 and
 $50,000 depending on the specifications required.

The Pontiac Firebird used in Knight Rider is a 'third generation' model made for 10 years between 1982 and 1992.

The car was available as a two-door coupe or as a convertible, with an engine size ranging from a standard 2.5 litre capacity, to a massive 5.7 litre Chevrolet V-8.

The car had a top speed of 162mph and would travel from 0 to 60mph in about seconds, depending on the engine models.

Even before Knight Rider first aired in 1982, it was obvious KITT would be the real star of the show.

Writer and producer Glen A. Larson said his intention was to 'do The Lone Ranger with a car', with KITT right at the heart of all the action.

The KITTs used in the show were Pontiac Firebird Trans Ams that David Hasselhoff's character Michael Knight had heavily modified - costing the show a staggering $100,000 to build.

KITT actually stands for Knight Industries Two Thousand, although in pre-production the name used was TATT - Trans Am Two Thousand.

The stunt work involved in the show led to between four and nine cars being ruined each season, but the cost dramatically reduced as time went on.

Pontiac started selling Knight Rider the basic black vehicles for a nominal $1 each, with the cusomisation of each one costing about $18,000.

The show even kept two versions of the car just for use in jump scenes. These vehicles had extra light bodies and higher-quality shock absorbers to make flying through the air and landing easier.
