A federal jury awarded crime writer Patricia Cornwell nearly $51 million Tuesday in her lawsuit against her former financial management company and a former principal in the firm.

It found New York-based Anchin, Block & Anchin LLP were to blame for the best-selling author's money problems, not her lavish spending which included $5m on private jets and a $40,000 per month lease at Trump Tower.

Despite earning over $10million a year in book sales, Cornwell is reportedly down to her last $13 million and has been forced to sell off her helicopter, sports cars and several homes in a bid to reduce her debt.

Cornwell said she was thrilled with the verdict, saying: 'God bless justice. It's a huge relief and it's been a huge ordeal.'

Lawyers for the New York firm and former principal Evan Snapper had said there was no money missing from Cornwell's accounts.

They blamed losses on the economic downturn and what they called Cornwell's extravagant lifestyle, which included Ferraris, helicopters and a temporary apartment in New York City she rented for $40,000 per month.

But Cornwell, 56, testified that Anchin moved her from a conservative management strategy to an aggressive one without her permission. She said she fired the firm in 2009 after discovering that her net worth was a little under $13 million, despite having eight-figure earnings in each of the previous four years.

She had said the firm caused her to miss a book deadline for the first time in her career when it failed to find her a suitable place to write after renovation work on her house in Concord went on much longer than expected.

'This was very destabilizing. I really lost my ability to focus and concentrate. I did not know what the book was about anymore,' Cornwell said.

The lawsuit said the missed deadline caused Cornwell to lose one year's income: about $15 million in non-recoverable advances and commission.

Cornwell's relationship with Anchin began in 2004. Cornwell said Anchin agreed to manage all her money and the assets of her company, Cornwell Entertainment Inc.  The lawsuit alleged negligence and breach of contract.

The case has shed a fascinating light on the writer, revealing her past relationships as well as her spending.

Papers submitted to the court revealed she l had a lesbian affair with a leading British police chief when the pair became ‘smitten’ with each other.

But the crime writer, 56, broke off the liaison and later told detectives that Caroline Nicholl, a former chief superintendent with Thames Valley Police, was a threat to her.

The American’s relationship with Miss Nicholl was revealed in US court papers alleging that financial managers wasted her multi-million dollar fortune.

The women met through a mutual friend and their affair started when Miss Nicholl invited the writer to do research in Milton Keynes, where she was in charge of policing 17 years ago.

Miss Nicholl, 57, said: ‘Yes, we did have a relationship. It lasted a matter of months. We must have seen each other probably no more than ten times.

‘She was very smart, self-effacing and charming, and clearly was enamoured that I was a police chief. She thought the uniform was amazing.

‘I didn’t know who she was. I’d never read any of her books. So I was expecting an old biddy or something.

‘The next time we met was when she was on a book tour in London. I invited her up to Milton Keynes because she liked to do research. She was smitten with me and I was smitten with her.’

According to the documents filed in Boston, Miss Cornwell said the affair ‘ended badly’.

The crime writer spent $5million on private jets to ferry her across the country

Defense lawyer James Campbell
said Cornwell's money worries were due to her extravagant lifestyle 
which included spending  $1,000-per-day on a car service, a $10 million 
renovation project at her Massachusetts estate and the $1.2 million 
purchase of a Florida condo.

The best-selling crime author also 
spent  $40,000 a month for an apartment at Trump Tower in New York City,
$200,000 in taxes alone for her customized, personal helicopter, 
$5million for private jets to ferry her across the country and 
$11million for private estates in Concord, Massachusetts. She also had 
several employees, including one who was paid $100,000.

The trial has cast a harsh spotlight on the intensely private 56-year-old. Cornwell lives with her longtime partner, Harvard University neuroscientist Staci Gruber. 

'Where
did the money go? Ms Cornwell and Dr Gruber spent the money,' said 
Campbell. 'You have to consider the large lifestyles involved, the 
spending habits, impulsive buying.'

Cornwell's
crime novels, most of which follow Virginia forensic examiner Kay 
Scarpetta, have made Cornwell a nationally-recognized name. Her books - 
which lean heavily on the use of forensic science - are credited as a 
major influence for the TV show 'CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.'

Her novels, including 'Postmortem,' 'Cruel and Unusual' and 'Book of the Dead' have sold more than 100million copies worldwide.

This is not the first time Cornwell 
has begrudgingly found herself in the spotlight. In the early 1990s, 
Cornwell had an affair with Margo Bennett, a married
FBI agent, which came out years later after Bennett's estranged husband
was arrested and convicted for the attempted murder of his wife and the
abduction of her pastor.

Wildly popular: Most of Cornwell's novels center around Virginia medical examiner Kay Scarpetta. The novels, which have sold 100million copies worldwide, are credited with introducing the forensic science crime genre

Cornwell has also publicly 
revealed that she struggles with bipolar disorder. Her lawyer argues 
that she hired Snapper and his firm to insulate herself from her money 
and that Snapper knew this and took advantage of her over her 
four-and-a-half-year relationship with the company.

'This case is, at its core, about trust,' her lawyer, Joan Lukey, told 
the jury. 'There is no amount of money that is enough to properly 
compensate her for what Anchin, Block and Anchin did.

Cornwell fired the firm after discovering in July 2009 that the net 
worth of her and her company, despite having earning above $10million in earnings per 
year during the previous four years, was a little under $13million, the
equivalent of only one year's net income.

She also claims in the lawsuit that Anchin had borrowed several 
million dollars, including mortgages for property and a loan for the 
purchase of a helicopter, and had lost millions by moving her from a 
conservative investment strategy to high-risk without her permission.

She said she also found checks written for expenses she never 
authorized, including a $5,000 check for a bat mitzvah gift to Snapper's
daughter from Cornwell, she alleges.

Cornwell says problems caused by Anchin and Snapper were so 
distracting that they caused her to miss a book deadline for the first 
time in her career and cost her $15 million in non-recoverable advances 
and commissions.

After Cornwell filed the lawsuit in 2009, Snapper pleaded guilty to 
violating campaign finance laws by buying $50,000 in tickets to an Elton
John concert benefiting Hillary Rodham Clinton, using Cornwell's money.
He paid a fine.

Cornwell, a Virginia native, is politically connected herself - though she has preferred to support Republican candidates in the past. 

She reportedly summered with President George H.W. Bush in Kennebunkport, Maine, and has close family ties to evangelist Billy Graham - even acting as a spokesperson for the family.

Lawyers for Anchin and Snapper deny Cornwell's claims. During opening
statements at the trial, attorney Campbell described Cornwell as 
'a demanding client' who 'tends to push off responsibility and assign 
blame when things go off track.'

'I do what I do when and how I do it,' she allegedly wrote in an email to Snapper read by Campbell to the jury.

Cornwell said one of Anchin's primary functions in 2006 was to ensure that locations were arranged where she could write without distraction while her home was undergoing reconstruction.

She said Snapper leased a series of expensive apartments, including one at Trump Tower in New York, that she had to leave long before leases expired because of construction, privacy or other issues.

In the lawsuit, Cornwell openly acknowledges her struggles with bipolar disorder, an illness she said has contributed to her belief that she needs other people to manage her business affairs and investments. She said Anchin was aware of her illness.
