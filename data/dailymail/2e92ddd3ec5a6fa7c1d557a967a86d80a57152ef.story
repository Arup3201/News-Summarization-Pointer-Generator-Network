A thief who ran off with a custom-made wheelchair belonging to a special need's child is being called 'despicable' and 'heartless.'

Vicki Lovecchio of Brookehaven, Pennsylvania left the $2200 chair right outside her home in the driveway on Monday afternoon after returning home with her four-year-old son Nicholas, who suffers from both epilepsy and microcephaly.

Shortly thereafter, the thief snatched the chair - as Vicki and Nicholas sat inside.

Police tell NBC 10 that they believe the thief, who has yet to be identified, wanted to use the chair for scrap metal. 

Now, Nicholas' family is making a desperate plea for the thief to return the chair, saying they won't even press charges against the culprit.

'If it shows up on our doorstep anonymously, that would be wonderful,' said Vicki. 

'We don’t want revenge or paybacks or punishment. We just want it back.'

The chair is crucial in allowing Nicholas to participate in the same activities as other children his age, be it attending a baseball game or being able to go trick-or-treating.

The family is now hoping that their insurance company will be able to cover the cost of a new chair.

Should that not come to be, the family has set up a Go Fund Me page to raise the necessary funds, which has already exceeded $2200 is less than 24 hours. 

Vicki is also optimistic that one positive thing may come out of this horrific incident as it brings more awareness to  microcephaly, a rare neurological condition that causes an abnormally small head.
