Scene: The woman's body was found on the beach at Winterton-on-Sea, around eight miles north in Great Yarmouth in Norfolk

The body of a woman has been found washed up on a deserted beach just hours after an open air party was believed to have been held nearby.

The unidentified woman who is believed to
be aged in her 60s was found dead by a walker at 3.45pm on Saturday at 
Winterton-on-Sea around eight miles north of Great Yarmouth, Norfolk.

Police at first treated the death as 'unexplained' and cordoned off an area so they could search for clues.

But Norfolk Police confirmed today that the death was not being treated as suspicious.

The
sandy beach and its wide expanse of dunes is designated as an Area of 
Outstanding Natural Beauty and is popular with surfers, walkers and 
wildlife lovers.

But the beach apparently had few visitors at around the time the body was found as temperatures in the area were only 12C.

A Norfolk Police spokeswoman said: 'Police can confirm that the death of a woman found at Winterton near 
Great Yarmouth is not being treated as suspicious.

'Officers were 
alerted to the discovery at about 3.45pm on Saturday. The woman believed
to be in her 60s, although enquiries to establish her identity 
continue.'

A message on Twitter suggested that a party had been held on the beach on Friday night

The body was found as the seas receding just over three hours after the high tide yesterday.

Police confirmed that they had re-opened the beach this morning, leaving no visible trace of where the body had been found.

A
surfer who arrived on the beach at around 4pm on Saturday posted a 
Facebook message, saying he had been told that a body had been washed 
up.

Beauty spot: It is believed a party was held on the beach at Winterton-on-Sea, an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, on Friday night

Winterton-on-Sea has around 650 homes and a population of 1,500, and has a reputation for being peaceful and quiet.

The
beach has a colony of Little Tern migrating birds during the summer 
months and is also home to rare species including Natterjack toads and 
adders.

Alan McMurchie, the controller of 
Winterton Coastwatch which operates a lookout post on the cliff over the
beach said yesterday (Sunday): 'Details are still very sketchy.

'I know that the body was reported by a member of the public who was walking on the beach.

'The police cars came first and I 
notified the Coastguard which sent a search and rescue team. I know the 
police cordoned off the area.

'The information from the Coastguard 
was that the police originally thought that it was a missing person, but
they were not sure.

'A police car came down earlier today
to look for a vehicle which would lead me to believe that it was 
possibly a suicide - but it is all speculation.

'The car park here is locked up at 
night when all the cars have gone and there were no vehicles left here 
overnight on Friday or Saturday.'

Investigation: Police are not treating the unidentified woman's death as suspicious

Mr McMurchie said he had seen no evidence of a party having been held on the beach on Friday night.

He said: 'There are occasions when 
there are parties, but it depends largely on the weather. In the summer,
you might get a few young people turning up at night to have a few 
drinks and strum on their guitars.

'If there had been a party of any 
consequence, we would normally have found signs of it. This is a 
conservation area and most people who come here are very environmentally
aware and quick to tell you about any bottles or cans left on the 
beach.

'There was a rave a couple of miles 
up the coast at Horsey about two years ago and you could the amplified 
music from miles away. However, nobody has reported anything here this 
weekend.'

Officials from Natural England were last week roping off a 400 yard section off the beach to provide a protected nesting spot for the Little Terns.

The village's parish council chairman Michael Bailey, 70, said: 'This is very sad news and my thoughts are with the family of the woman.

'I have not heard anything about what might have happened. I was not aware of a beach party being held on Friday night. Normally if there is a big party, we are alerted by the police.

'We are just a quiet and peaceful little village. Winterton is totally different from Great Yarmouth. We have got no amusements or slot machines.

'Part of the beach is fenced off for the Little Terns every summer.'
