It's not really a sight for sore eyes. 

A man has managed to lift 33kg of weights using just his eye sockets - a feat that most people would find fairly tough with their arms. 

The weightlifter, called Lachyl Abdul Guseynov, performed the stunt during a competition in Georgia, in Europe, on Monday.

Triumphant: Mr Guseynov holds two extra weights above his head as he stands up

Video footage of the stunt shows him attaching the weights to the bones underneath his eyes using metal hooks and chains.

As he stands up he also lifts two weights above his head, much to the delight of the watching crowd.

It’s not a sight for the squeamish – and neither is the spectacle of Dr Satyajit Hota of India lifting weights with his eyelids.

In 2001 he set a Guinness World Record for this by lifting three kilograms.

Earlier this year Asha Rani set two world records for lifting weights with her ears and hair.

The 23-year-old has been dubbed the Iron Queen because of her amazing strength. She managed to lift 30.8kgs - almost five stone - with just the power of her ears and 8st 7lbs with her hair, which she wore in plaits, beating the record of the previous holder, who managed 8st 4lbs in 2012.

For both astonishing records Asha had to raise the weights 10cm off the ground for an agonising five seconds.

The Iron Queen made her way into the Guinness Book of Records after setting the new records in a leisure centre in Leicester.
