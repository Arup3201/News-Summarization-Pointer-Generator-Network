The boyfriend of former Stepping Hill poisoning suspect Rebecca Leighton was caught with child pornography when police stumbled on his disgusting crime while investigating his partner.

Timothy Papworth, 29, searched the internet for the sick sexual images over an eight month period on a computer seized by chance from their flat last year, Manchester Crown Court heard.

He was caught when police launched a dawn raid last July on the Stockport home he shared with nurse Miss Leighton.

At the time she was suspected of fatally poisoning patients with spiked saline solution at the town's Stepping Hill hospital, where she worked as a nurse.

Charges against her were dropped last September after she had spent six weeks behind bars on remand.

But she was later sacked for stealing the drug tramadol from the hospital.

The sick images accessed in the couple’s flat above Mr Papworth’s darts shop in Heaviley, Stockport.

The material is understood to have been downloaded from a file-sharing website.

Papworth has pleaded guilty to possessing indecent photographs of children and has been ordered to sign the Sex Offenders’ Register.

He admitted his guilt on the day a trial was due to begin, having previously denied accessing the material.

Papworth admitted the charge on the basis that he searched the internet for the material five times and viewed it at least three times before deleting it.

Judge Roger Thomas QC allowed Papworth’s unconditional bail to continue until sentencing later this year.

'This is very much a case that brings about the very real possibility of community sentencing and some positive therapeutic type sentence,' the judge told him.

A probation report on Papworth was ordered before he appears for sentence on May 21.

Registered nurse Victorino Chua, 46, of Stockport, is on bail after being arrested in connection with the Stepping Hill poisoning investigation.

He was questioned on suspicion of three counts of murder and 18 counts of causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

Six deaths in total have been linked to an insulin poisoner at the hospital.

In total 21 patients thought to have been deliberately poisoned on wards A1, A2 or A3 – which care for seriously ill patients – between June 1 and July 15 last year.

Nearly two weeks after it started the alarm was first raised by hospital staff when a higher than normal number of patients were reported to have 'unexplained' low blood sugar levels.

Police have described the investigation as very complex - and are having to examine a bewildering 700 people who could have contaminated saline fluid.

Officers are continuing to probe the deaths of multiple sclerosis sufferer Tracey Arden, 44, Arnold Lancaster, 71, Derek Weaver, 83, and Bill Dickson, 82, a former senior Daily Mail journalist, who all died after suffering ‘hypoglycaemic episodes’ – a dangerous drop in blood sugar levels.

In January John Beeley, 73, and grandmother Linda McDonagh, 60, died and were then linked to the poisoner's campaign.
