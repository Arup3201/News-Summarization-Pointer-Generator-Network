‘White widow’ terror suspect Samantha Lewthwaite has reappeared on Twitter, making references to soap operas and Strictly Come Dancing.

The world’s most wanted woman made the bizarre comments while tweeting about her love for jihad.

The mother of four is thought to be a key member of Al-Shabaab. The Al-Qaeda-linked Somali terrorist group carried out the Nairobi mall attack last month in which 67 people were killed, including six Britons.

On the run: 'White widow' Samantha Lewthwaite

Intelligence analysts believe Lewthwaite – who was married to 7/7 bomber Germaine Lindsay – is using a Twitter account named after the Muslim Youth Centre, a Kenyan offshoot of Al-Shabaab.

Although Lewthwaite, 29, stopped tweeting in the aftermath of the Nairobi attacks, she apparently began again a fortnight ago, with her last message being posted as recently as Friday evening.

One of her first tweets since the attacks said: ‘In Islam there’s no choice. It’s not like, “Do I watch EastEnders or Corrie tonight?” No shortcuts in Islam!’

It is believed the tweet is a reference to the belief among many Muslim extremists that jihad against unbelievers is obligatory.

Rant: Intelligence analysts believe Lewthwaite is behind the tweets from this account, which reference British pop culture

Secret tweeter: Lewthwaite, pictured, has links to Al-Shabaab. the terrorist cell which was behind the Nairobi mall attack

Happy families: Lewthwaite was dubbed a 'white widow' after the death of her husband Jermaine Lindsay, the suicide bomber died in the 7/7 attacks on the London underground in 2005

In another post, Lewthwaite added: ‘Muslims in Somalia don’t want to  sit at home on a Saturday evening glued to Strictly Come Dancing with its C-list “stars”:))).’

She also appears to mock British police’s arrests of UK-based terror suspects, adding: ‘Oi! You’ve been nabbed Sunny [sic] Jim!’

Although it is impossible to verify who is writing the messages, the author refers to herself as ‘a girl in Kenya’, uses British references and speaks of Lewthwaite in the third person.

Intelligence analysts believe the tweets are by the fugitive widow.

Lewthwaite, a former soldier’s daughter from Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, is said to have converted to Islam as a teenager.

Identity: The person behind the tweets has said that she is 'a girl in Kenya'

'Nabbed': She appeared to comment on recent terror arrests in the UK

'No shortcuts in Islam': Lewthwaite suggested that being a Muslim does not allow choices, such as that between EastEnders and Coronation Street

Rejected: Lethwaite added that Somalian Muslims don't want to watch Strictly Come Dancing, hosted by Sir Bruce Forsyth, left, and Tess Daly, right

Calling herself by the Islamic name Sherafiyah, she met and married Lindsay in 2002.

After the 7/7 attacks, she returned to Aylesbury but fled the UK by 2011, moving between Tanzania and Kenya to raise money for terrorism through fraud.

She has been on the run from Kenyan authorities after she narrowly escaped a police raid two years ago.

After the Nairobi attacks last month, Interpol issued an international  warrant for her arrest.

A Twitter spokesman said yesterday that it did not comment on individual users’ accounts.
