The Spanish League will decide Tuesday afternoon if they are going to take action against Barcelona supporters singing ‘Ronaldo is a drunk’ at the Camp Nou on Sunday night.

The League have officials at every La Liga match and the one at Barcelona’s meeting with Levante at the weekend included hearing the song in their report. If the Spanish League reports it to the Antiviolence Committee Barcelona could be fined or even have a part of the Nou Camp closed.

The steps being considered are a result of Spanish football’s intention of cutting out all forms of crowd trouble or incitement to crowd trouble since a Deportivo supporter was killed in a pitched battle before a match at Atletico Madrid’s Vicente Calderon stadium in November.

Despite what some might term 'terrace banter' appearing to have little to do with the organised violence that ended with a supporter being beaten to death outside a stadium last year, the football authorities have included chants and songs in their crackdown on trouble.

Barca fan taunts followed Ronaldo’s 30th birthday party when he was videoed and photographed celebrating after a 4-0 defeat by Atletico Madrid.

The league threatened similar action for sections of the Bernabeu chanting ‘Messi is retarded’ in December but none was taken. Real Madrid, however, were reported to have identified the 17 supporters who started the chant and expelled them.

In the past abuse of a racist nature aimed at players has gone unpunished in Spain with Dani Alves, Samuel Eto’o and Ashley Cole on international duty for England at the Bernabeu in 2004 all victims.

The apparently frivolous nature of the song aimed at Ronaldo mean any serious punishment is likely to be met with ridicule outside of Spain. But with the Real Madrid v Barcelona rivalry colouring all La Liga debate there will be no shortage of Real Madrid supporters keen for the League to carry through on its threat.
