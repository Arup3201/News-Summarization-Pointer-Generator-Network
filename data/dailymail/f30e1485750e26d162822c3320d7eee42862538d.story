No sooner had the last of the poppies been planted than they were set to be packed away.

At 9am today, less than 24 hours after the war dead were remembered on the 11th hour of the 11th day on the 11th month, thousands of volunteers will begin to dismantle the poignant tribute.

The Tower of London poppies – which touched the hearts of millions who came to honour Britain’s First World War dead - will all be gone by the end of the month.

888,246 poppies have been planted in the dry 16-acre moat around the Tower of London. At 9am today, less than 24 hours after the war dead were remembered, volunteers will begin to dismantle the poignant tribute

This morning the first of 8,000 volunteers are set to move into the moat and begin packaging each of the 888,246 poppies into boxes.

They will then be transported offsite, where they will be cleaned before being sent on to those who bought them across the country.

Following a Daily Mail campaign to extend the tribute, David Cameron announced one segment of the art installation will stay for longer than originally planned.

One of the sculptural sections of the memorial will remain at the Tower for an extra two and a half weeks until the end of November so more people have a chance to see it.

This will be The Wave – which rises over the causeway used by visitors to enter the castle.

The Weeping Window, which is made up of thousands of poppies cascading out of the Tower’s window, will be removed in the next few days once the poppies surrounding it are gone.

It is likely to go into storage until the end of November, when it will then tour the country along with The Wave for four years.

Both of them will then be permanently installed at the Imperial War Museums in London and Manchester.

Not a single poppy representing each British and colonial death during the war will remain after November.

An estimated five million people have visited the artwork entitled Blood-Swept Lands and Seas of Red by ceramic artist Paul Cummins, from Derbyshire.

The poppies were so popular that all 888,246 of them were sold in advance for £25 each.

The Royal British Legion said it hopes the sale of the poppies will raise in excess of £15m.

Ten per cent of every poppy sold will be shared between six service charities, including Help for Heroes and the Royal British Legion.

The first ceramic poppy was planted in the Tower moat on July 17 and over the past few weeks some 50 poppies crammed into every square metre.

Historic Royal Palaces, the charity which operates the landmark, said the process of packing up the poppies will take between ten to 14 days.

It is understood each volunteer will be given a three-hour slot to package up the poppies.

The tour of the poppies is being supported by donations from two charities, the Backstage Trust and the Clore Duffield Foundation, together with government funding.

Thousands of poppies included in the two sculptural sections of the memorial have been bought by the charities – and therefore all members of the public who have pre-purchased there poppies will receive them as planned.

The poppies are expected to be delivered to their owners by January.

More than £500,000 is being paid by the government to cover the cost of storing, transporting and installing the poppy sculptures in towns and cities across the UK.

The funding will come from fines accrued from the Libor banking scandal.
