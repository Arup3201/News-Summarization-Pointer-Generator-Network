Suspect: Fransico Montano, 21, has turned himself in after his girlfriend, Gloria Sanchez, 21, was found dead in the street on Thursday night in Santa Ana, California

A woman who 
died after sustaining major head injuries following a tumble from a 
moving vehicle in Santa Ana, California, has been identified as her boyfriend turns himself in.

The body of 21-year-old Gloria Sanchez 
was found in the roadway in the 1600 block of W. Edinger on Thursday 
night about 8 p.m. 

On
Friday evening, police said Sanchez’s boyfriend, 21-year-old Fransico 
Montano surrendered to authorities but was being 'uncooperative', according to CBS Los Angeles.

Montano is also the father
of the infant.

Sanchez was found dead lying next to her 
13-month-old daughter on the road after either being pushed or having jumped out of a 
moving car.

Detectives on Friday were initially trying to identify her and her little girl, who was still alive with minor injuries.

Police said the child and Sanchez had been taken to an area hospital 
where the mother was pronounced dead.

Montana has since been booked on suspicion of felony hit-and-run. His bail was set at $200,000.
