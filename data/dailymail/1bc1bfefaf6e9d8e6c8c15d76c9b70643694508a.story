The man who testified against A-Rod during the New York Yankee player's suspension appeal has been pictured with a suspicious white powder.

In a photo released by the New York Post, Biogenesis founder Anthony Bosch is pictured at a table that has two bags of unidentified white powder on it.

The credibility of Mr Bosch is central to the fate of A-Rod, also known as Alex Rodriguez, as he fights against his 211-game suspension.

Hearing: Alex Rodriguez arrives at the MLB's New York headquarters to appeal his suspension last week

The Major League Baseball player is believed to have acquired an affidavit from Robert Davis Miller that claims Mr Bosch used cocaine 'on almost a daily basis, but at least many times per week and month'.

Claims: Biogenesis founder Anthony Bosch allegedly took cocaine

According to the affidavit, seen by the New York Post, Mr Bosch's drug use took place from the summer of 2012 to the spring of this year.

During arbitration A-Rod's legal team questioned Mr Bosch about his cocaine use, but attorneys for the MLB objected to the line of questioning, according to NBC Sports.

Mr Bosch's credibility as a witness is central to the case, which comes down to accusations against A-Rod and his explanation of Biogenesis documents which purport to show the baseball player's PED use.

The New York Yankees' player was suspended in August for alleged violations of the sport's drug agreement and labor contract, and he played pending a determination of the grievance.

The legal team representing A-Rod didn't call Mr Miller as a witness, so the affidavit will only be used if A-Rod launches a lawsuit against the MLB.

It is alleged that during his testimony, given over five days at the appeal hearing, Mr Bosch had text messages and emails to support his claim that he sold performance-enhancing drugs to A-Rod.

Appeal date: A-Rod at the MLB suspension hearing. A ruling is expected in January

As well as claiming that Mr Bosch used cocaine, Mr Miller has also alleged that the Biogenesis founder said he was being paid $5 million by the MLB.

Mr Bosch has denied receiving any payments for his cooperation in the case, as has the MLB.

A ruling on A-Rod's appeal is expected in January.
