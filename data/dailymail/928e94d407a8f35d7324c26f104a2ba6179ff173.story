Tottenham are determined to overcome a transfer wrangle with Swansea City in their attempts to land left-back Ben Davies.

New Tottenham manager Mauricio Pochettino wants the Wales international to be his first-choice left-back next season.

Spurs and Swansea have been locked in talks over a proposed move for Davies - who is valued at £12million - to White Hart Lane.

Tottenham thought they had made a breakthrough in discussions last Friday, after tabling an offer for the full-back that they believed was enough to snare Davies.

Sportsmail understands the 21-year-old was even due to arrive at the club's Enfield training ground on Monday for talks.

However, sources close to the deal claim Swans chairman Huw Jenkins pulled the plug on the deal over the weekend, causing a delay in the move.

Pochettino still remains highly interested in signing Davies ahead of next season, and Tottenham are trying to revive the deal.

However, it remains to be seen whether an agreement can be reached following the wrangle.

Davies is also attracting interest from Atletico Madrid.
