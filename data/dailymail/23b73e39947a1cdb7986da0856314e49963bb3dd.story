As many as 150 defendants could walk free after a heroin-addicted FBI agent ingested the evidence against at least 28 alleged drug dealers.

Investigators claim that agent Matthew Lowry, who worked on the heroin task force in Washington, used his position to steal seized heroin from the evidence room which he then used for more than a year.

Dozens of charges have already been dismissed against defendants. 

As many as 150 defendants could walk free after a heroin-addicted FBI agent ingested the evidence against at least 28 alleged drug dealers; Lowry signed the drugs out of police evidence using the name of his superiors

Lowry was reportedly able to conceal his thefts for over a year in part because of FBI regulations that allowed him to transport the drugs alone in his own vehicle.

According to the Washington Post, which cited FBI documents, Lowry has told how he checked out drugs from cases he had worked on the pretense that he was having them tested at a lab. 

He then reportedly kept the drugs, sometimes for days but at other times for months, and used a small amount each day before submitting them for testing. Once testing was complete, Lowry would return the drugs to the FBI.

A form Lowry used to check drugs out which caused the case against one defendant to be dropped

Agent Matthew Lowry used his position on the heroin task force to access the drugs which he took home on the pretense of having tested, only to then use them himself

According to court documents, Lowry forged signatures of superiors to authorize withdrawals and used colleagues' names when resealing evidence bags he had opened. To lessen the chances of getting caught, Lowry often targeted cases that were already resolved in the hope that no one would notice the missing evidence.

Lowry told investigators he often used laxatives or creatine to refil the bags of heroin.

According to the newspaper, a recent FBI investigation found that 'every one of the nation's field offices had problems' tracking gun and drug evidence and that in some cases, 'drugs disappeared for months without notice'.
