About a third of six-year-olds are still struggling with their reading after their first year at school, official figures show.

Some 69 per cent of Year 1 pupils at mainstream state schools scored 32 out of 40, the standard expected.

Almost 180,000 children fell short of the standard in tests, although it was an 11 per cent improvement on the previous year.

Girls outperformed boys, with 73 per cent reaching the target compared with 65 per cent.

By the end of Year 2, however, 85 per cent of pupils had achieved the desired mark or higher.

The Department for Education’s figures are based on the results of controversial new ‘synthetic phonics’ tests that were introduced last year.

Teachers have opposed the measure, in which children have to say 40 words – half of which are made up ‘pseudo-words’.

Ministers said the tests 
would help boost reading standards but they have faced deep opposition 
among teachers, who claimed it would not give them sufficient 
information about children’s abilities and risked labelling them as 
failures at an early age.

A survey by the National Literacy Trust has also revealed that more than a fifth of children think it is embarrassing to be seen reading a book – a leap of five per cent on two years ago.

Teaching unions have condemned the tests based on phonics but Education Minister Elizabeth Truss said checks help identify pupils who need extra learning to read

Those reading in their own time have also plummeted, from 38 per cent in 2005 to 24 per cent now.

More than a quarter of the 35,000 children aged eight to 16 who took part revealed their parents don’t care if they like books.

Those
who didn’t think ‘reading is cool’ were four times more likely to have 
below-average reading skills for their age - 22.7 per cent compared to 
5.8 per cent.

The National Literacy Trust is trying to reverse the trend 
with a Literacy Heroes campaign involving people who have made a 
positive impact on reading including bestselling authors Joanna Trollope
and Dorothy Koomson.

Its patron, the Duchess of Cornwall said to was important to ‘ignite a passion for reading in the next generation’.

Director Jonathan Douglas added: ‘Our 
research not only reveals children are reading less and developing more 
negative attitudes towards reading but also that there is a clear 
correlation between this and their performance in reading tests.’

Teacher assessment figures for children at the end of Key Stage 1 were also published yesterday.

The number of seven-year-old who reached the expected level in reading, writing, and speaking and listening rose slightly to 89 per cent, 85 per cent and 89 per cent respectively.

Maths was the same as last year, on 91 per cent.

Teachers’ unions renewed their attacks on the phonics test yesterday.

Christine Blower, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, described it as ‘pernicious’.

She added: ‘Children develop at different levels. The slow reader at five can easily be the good reader by the age of 11.

‘We cannot continue with this obsession of testing and categorising as failures our very young children.’

But Education Minister Elizabeth Truss said checks would help identify pupils who need extra help learning to read.

‘Many thousands of children will now receive the extra support they need to catch up with their peers and develop a love of reading,’ she added.
