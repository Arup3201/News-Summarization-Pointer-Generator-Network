It's a bit of an unconventional way to stop a vicious dog fight, but it seemed to work for one woman who used her finger to stick up another dogs bum.

Dog owner Ann Bendouli had to think quick when her beloved dog, one year old Jack Russell, Lexy, was being mauled to death by another dog on Hampton Beach in Melbourne's south on Sunday.  

The unusual method has also seen an instant reaction from the social media world and #superstarfinger is now trending globally on twitter.

Ms Bendouli was out walking Lexy, at the off leash area, when she it's believed a Staffordshire cross terrier bolted at them and bit down on her pup and locked his jaws.

When she was confronted by her innocent dog being attacked, the distressed owner had no choice but to intervene after kicking and pulling at the Staffy didn't work. 

'It was screaming and I thought I've lost my dog,' she told Seven News

It's believed the fight went on for about four to five minutes before Ms Bendouli took matters into her own hands and lifted the Staffy's tail and did what most vets do with a thermometre and stuck her finger up the dogs backside.

'She had her upside down and she was shaking. So, I lifted its tail and I put my finger up its anal passage so deep, I felt the flesh.'

Needless to say the dog got the shock of it's life at her unorthodox method and gave out a howl, before suddenly stopping and letting go. 

'She's my soul mate and I love her so much. I was so glad that she was actually saved because I would be lost,' she also told Nine News. 

The Jack Russell suffered serious injuries and was required to have emergency treatment where she received more than 10 stitches.

But the dog wasn't the only victim in the attack, the Staffy's owner also came off second best when she had half of her toe bitten off trying to break the fight up.

She was required to have plastic surgery.
