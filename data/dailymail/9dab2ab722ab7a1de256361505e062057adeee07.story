An untouched Melbourne property which has been in the same family for generations has been placed on the market for the first time.

The Fitzroy North home once belonged to war veteran Eric Worsley, who passed away at the age of 102 in 2013, after inheriting the house from his mother.

8 St George's Road South, now owned by Mr Worsley's carer, Maria, has been left in it's original condition out of respect, creating the distinct impression of a museum or time-capsule.

8 St George's Road South, Fitzroy North, has hit the market and is up for auction

Still filled with the belongings of Mr Worsley, a war veteran, and kitted out with peeling paint and well-worn furniture, the home is now up for grabs. 

The property is expected to sell for upwards of $640,000 when it goes up for auction on Valentines Day under the guidance of selling agent Steven Scalise, from Chambers Real Estate.

'The home means a lot to me. I grew up in this area and I used to go the picture theatre across the road,' said Maria.

'When I was a little girl there was a children's matinee show and all the local children would congregate out the front, and Eric said he could hear the chatter of the children waiting for the doors to open,' she told Fairfax Media.

The two-bedroom home has all the charm and antiquity of a well-loved family home, still lined with checkered linoleum and painted shades synonymous with the 1960's.

The house even has old television sets, leather suitcases stacked atop a wardrobe, and a sunhat hanging from a dresser.

The selling agent described the home as 'untouched by time', one of three matching decorative mid-Victorian terraces built as a trio. 

'On entering you will discover a relic of an era long past that reads more like a meticulously constructed film set than original faded Victorian,' reads the property description.

Original period features, including vintage wallpaper, an original fireplace, and brightly coloured flooring complete the time-capsule feel.

With two master bedrooms, a wide entrance hall, and a central lounge/living area adjacent to a central bathroom, the house is well-loved.

Several aspects of the house which have been deemed 'unusable', including the kitchen and another original bathroom, add to the sense of the property being frozen in time.

The house boasts an east-facing rear yard, and a pedestrian side access that runs the length of the house, situated on a block of 155 square metres.

The property has been marked as needing significant renovation for dwelling, with the potential for adding value to the investment through carefully selected upgrades.

The street is also very close to inner-city living, situated only minutes away from trams, galleries, up-market shopping and boutiques.
