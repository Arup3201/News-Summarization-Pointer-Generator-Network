A council was forced to put the brakes on a controversial parking scheme – after neighbours pointed out there was nowhere to pay.

Residents were baffled when workers unveiled signs for new restrictions before pay machines had been installed.

It is the latest gaffe by East Sussex’s Brighton and Hove City Council, which later covered up the signs.

Last week The Mail on Sunday revealed how the Green-controlled council was responsible for a catalogue of recent blunders.

A spokesman said the scheme had been hit by an ‘unforeseen delivery delay’.

Earlier this year, two parking wardens in Brighton issued a driver with a ticket after his car broke down in the middle of a busy road.

Passers-by watched in disbelief as wardens from Brighton and Hove City Council, East Sussex, slapped a ticket on the silver saloon car's windscreen after the driver left to fetch help.

The car, believed to be a VW Passat, was ticketed while broken down on a busy road in Brighton city centre. A child seat was visible in the vehicle.

Brighton and Hove City Council has been criticised in recent years for the amount of money it makes from parking.

In December last year it was revealed that the council's overall profit from parking services for 2012/13 was £16.3million - the most of any local authority outside London.

Speaking at the time, a Brighton and Hove City Council spokesman said:  'We don't provide commentary on individual cases.

'The driver is well within their rights to make a case for appeal. That will be considered in time.

'However it would be unfair for us to comment beforehand.'

Starting with just one councillor in 1996, the Green Party’s rise to power in Brighton has been unprecedented and rapid.

In 2010  there was the election of Caroline Lucas as the MP for Brighton Pavilion – the party’s first Westminster seat – and then came the capture of the city council just a year later.
