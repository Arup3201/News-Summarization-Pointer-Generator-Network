The perfect recipe for love used to be eyes meeting across a crowded room followed by hours of scintillating conversation but now it seems that stimulating chats have been replaced by 140-character tweets.

According to a new study, Twitter is now the most common way of winning over a potential new partner and has even overtaken texting and phone calls.

On average, it now takes 224 tweets, 163 text messages, 70 Facebook messages, 37 emails and 30 phone calls to seal the deal.

And as a result of all the tweeting, texting and emailing, young couples now fall in love faster than ever before.

The study, which was conducted by electronics retailer PIXmania, found that within the space of a single generation, the amount of time taken for love to blossom has more than halved.

Couples aged 55 and over said on average their courting process took more than two and a half months (78 days) whereas for those under the age of 25 it takes just under one month (24 days) for them to refer to each other as boyfriend and girlfriend.

As a result, researchers believe that this could signals the end of the traditional 'three day rule' where would-be lovers wait for 72 hours before calling a date back.

Instead, it's now closer to three hours, with two thirds saying they were happy to contact their new beau within four hours of their first date.

Interestingly, men are more likely than women to pursue a potential partner over social media, sending an average of 517 Facebook messages and tweets a year compared to just 386 for women.

The study also found that less than one in ten of the nationâ€™s couples still write old-fashioned love letters to each other.

However, the number of couples willing to send saucy texts and explicit pictures to each other has increased, with more than a third of couples admitting to sexting.

Over half of the people questioned by researchers also said they feel less inhibited when using 
technology to chat up a date.

Technology is also the preferred method of ending modern relationships, with 36 per cent saying they prefer to break up over the phone, 27 per cent admitting to doing it by text and one in eight (13 
per cent) saying they had done it using social media.

Ghadi Hobeika, marketing director of PIXmania.com, said: 'With the nation obsessed with constantly communicating with one another, modern technology is putting the speed into speed dating and encouraging more contact between budding lovers.

'The days of penning a simple love letter to woo your new beau are over. From flirting on Facebook to teasing on Twitter modern day lovers are increasingly embracing technology to help snare their catch.'
