A man has today been found guilty of murdering a mother-of-nine who was hacked to death before being dumped in a wheelie bin.

Shauna Lee, 36, was pregnant with twins when she was killed by Karl Burman and her remains have never been found. It is believed she was incinerated.

Burman, 24, was jailed for life with a minimum term of 19 years for killing his partner Shauna Lee.

Prosecutor Mark Wall QC told Birmingham 
Crown Court during the trial that the defendant had chopped up the mother's 
body, put the parts in bin bags and chucked them away with the rubbish.

As the waste is not routinely inspected, it is likely the human remains would have been taken away by council binmen unaware of what was inside.

Police investigating her disappearance 
had little success until Burman dialled 999 some six months after she disappeared in November 2010 and said he had killed her.

Prosecutor Mr Wall said: 'He said he hit her over the head with a hammer.

'He said he then chopped her up using “garden loppers”. He claimed it took him a day or two to chop her up.

'He said after he had chopped her up he put her in bin bags and chucked her away. All in all he said it took about seven days.'

In interviews Burman claimed that Miss Lee had asked him to help her commit suicide.

During the trial, forensic expert 
witnesses said that Shauna’s blood had been found all over her flat in 
Lower Coundon, Coventry.

Attempts had been made to clean the stains off the carpet, walls and radiator, but traces were discovered.

In one confession, Burman told an 
adult supervisor he had used garden loppers to chop up Miss Lee’s body 
before putting it into black bags which he then disposed of in a wheelie
bin.

A pathologist estimated that it would
take around an hour to dismember a corpse although, in another 
confession, Burman had claimed it took him one or two days.

Tragic Miss Lee, who had all of her children put in care, had told friends she was pregnant just before she disappeared.

Just
a few days before her 
disappearance Miss Lee had told police that when she had told her 
partner she was expecting twins he had taken her to hospital urging her 
to have an 
abortion.

When they returned
home without being seen by doctors he was said to have repeatedly 
punched her in the stomach and on the back of the head in a 30 minute 
attack.

Miss Lee told police
about the assault on October 30 but police only spoke to Burman on 
December 5 - by which time he had already killed her.

Today
Burman, from Foleshill, Coventry, showed no reaction as the jury found 
him guilty of murder in just two hours and two minutes after a 
three-week trial.

Judge Kate Thirlwall told him: 'Shauna had nine children, all of them in care, but we know from other members of her family that they are responsible for two of her children.

Burman used a pair of garden loppers, like these pictured, to hack up Miss Lee's body

'She loved her children and told them so every time they met.

'The children have lost their mother’s love and, in due course, they will have to come to terms with the manner of her death.

'You struck her repeatedly on the head with a hammer. She was much smaller than you - you can only have intended to kill her.

'Having done that you set about disposing of her body. You did so with chilling efficiency.

'No part of her body has ever been found, there has never been a funeral or memorial service.'

Speaking after the sentencing, Shauna’s brother Chris said that she would 'never be forgotten'.

He said: 'Shauna is always in our hearts, reminding us she is with us wherever we go.

'She will always be remembered and never forgotten, we will love her always.

'Our hearts are torn in two not being
able to grieve for Shauna, as we all miss her so terribly. Till this 
day I don’t know why this happened, but me, Sam and the kids will always
miss you.'
