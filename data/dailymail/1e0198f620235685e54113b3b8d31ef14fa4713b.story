A three-year-old girl died in a tragic accident on Monday after a window blind cord got caught round her neck.

Voxie O'Hara Hendrix Beckett and her two-year-old brother had been put down for an afternoon nap by their parents, Erik and Chesshuwa Beckett in their home in Sacramento, California.

As she slept Voxie became entangled in the cord which ensnared her neck, cutting off her air supply.

Tragic: Voxie O'Hara Hendrix Beckett died on Monday after her neck became ensnared by a window blind cord as she slept

When Mr and Mrs Beckett stopped by the bedroom to check on their children they found Voxie's lifeless body, still wrapped up in the cord, the Sacramento Bee reported.

Horrified, they dialed 911 and a fire crew was dispatched to their home on the 5500 block of M Street.

Officers desperately tried to revive the young girl, performing CPR as they rushed her to hospital, but she did not survive. She was pronounced dead later that day at Sutter Memorial Hospital.

So young: Voxie was napping with one of her brothers, a two-year-old

In her obituary Voxie is described as having a 'sweet nature'

Respected: Voxie's parents, Erik (pictured) and Chesshuwa Beckett, are both teachers

Voxie's distraught mum and dad now face the heart-breaking task of planning their baby's funeral.

In a Legacy.com obituary they asked that funeral-goers wear pink in honour of their daughter, described as having a 'sweet nature'.

The Consumer Product Safety Commission advises:

The Becketts, both Sacremento 
High School teachers, are popular and respected members of their 
community and have two other children, Zildjian and Strummer.

On ratemyteachers.com Mrs Beckett is described as 'the best ever' and 'super nice'.

In
an online tribute, posted on Tumblr, one devastated friend of the family describes 
the family as 'perfect', adding that Voxie was 'one of the most amazing 
little girls that I have ever met'.

The Consumer Product Safety Commission has released a series of tips to parents of young children about window coverings.

Recommendations include that cribs, beds, furniture and toys are kept away from window cords and that the cords are out of the reach of children.

The commission also advises that parents consider installing cordless coverings in rooms likely to be frequented by their children, such as playrooms, and that old cords are replaced with modern, less dangerous products.

Voxie's death is being treated as an accident.
