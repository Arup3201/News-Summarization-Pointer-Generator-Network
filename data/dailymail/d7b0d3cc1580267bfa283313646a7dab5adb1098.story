NFL legend Jerry Rice has filed a lawsuit after the sale of his $11 million mansion collapsed

NFL legend Jerry Rice has filed a lawsuit against the prospective buyers of his $11million Atherton mansion after they pulled out of the sale having failed to meet a deadline.

The former San Francisco 49er is reportedly demanding to keep both the $330,000 deposit and the home, which had originally been put on the market at $15million.

The buyers are believed to have signed a contract agreeing to close the deal by July 15 or forfeit their deposit.

The sprawling three-storey home is set in 1.4 acres of the nation's second most expensive zip code.

It
boasts six bedrooms, ten bathrooms, a guesthouse, a deluxe home cinema,
its own elevator, a full gym with steam room with sauna and plunge 
pool, a game room with full bar and even a dedicated gift-wrapping room.

There's a seven-car garage and a 5,000 square foot basement which houses a games room, full bar, wine room and crafts room.

The 'family room' is equipped with seven 
televisions next to each other so  different football games can be 
watched at the same time while the gym boats more than $500,000 worth of
equipment.

Sweetener: The star agreed to include expensive furniture and gym equipment in an attempt to push the deal through

Rice and his wife over 
four years to plan and build the home from the ground up and it contains an estimated $2 million worth of electronic equipment.

Described as French Chateau-style, the 15,000 square foot property was built by Lencioni Construction at a reported price of nearly $1,000 per square foot.

Following its completion a delighted Rice told Haute Living Magazine: 'The lot is really unique for the area because it is set so far back from the road, it’s perfect because it gives us privacy.

'You don’t want a house that sits right on Atherton Avenue because of the noise and the traffic.

'The beauty of the lot and the long driveway for us as a family was that the kids and I could play outside anytime without having to worry about security or privacy issues.'

Mr Rice put the property on the market last year represented by his longtime friend Pierre Buljan of Cashin Company for $14,750,000.

After dropping the price by $4million he even added some top-of-the-range gym equipment and expensive furniture in an attempt to close the deal. 

He added: 'That has been the most important part of the house for me.

'If I’m up late and can’t sleep, I can just trot downstairs for a workout and then relax in the sauna or rejuvenate with the cold plunge. I love it for privacy reasons, too. I love being able to get into my workout without having to consider the social aspects of going out to a gym.'

Jerry Rice is regarded by most football experts as the greatest wide receiver of all time.

He is a member of the NFL hall of fame and the holder of three Super Bowl rings which he won playing for the 49ers as well as an AFC championship with the Oakland Raiders.
