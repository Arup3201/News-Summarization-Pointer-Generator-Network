However pleasing the updated Scottish Premiership table may have been for James McArthur on Sunday evening, he scarcely required smelling salts to revive him for the short taxi ride from Glasgow Airport to Mar Hall.

As one of Hamilton’s most celebrated graduates of recent times, the Crystal Palace midfielder has long been able to testify that nothing at the Lanarkshire club happens completely by chance.

If there’s every possibility that the 1-0 victory at Celtic Park which took Accies back to the summit of Scottish football will be a short-lived pinnacle for Alex Neil’s side, then who would bet against the newly-promoted outfit yet finishing in the top six or possibly troubling the European places?

Since an opening-day wobble at home to Inverness, Accies have now gone 10 games in all competitions without defeat.

St Johnstone, St Mirren, Motherwell and now Celtic are among the sides lying in their wake with not a hard-luck story between them. Those who once questioned the benefit the top division would gain from a team with a fan-base edging into four figures have long since been silenced.

The real beauty of Hamilton’s success is its simplicity. A policy of augmenting an experienced spine with their finest youth players isn’t just proving successful – it’s also self-funding.

McArthur’s initial £500,000 fee to Wigan has recently been topped up by a generous slice of the £7million Palace subsequently paid for him this summer. Likewise, James McCarthy’s initial £1.2m switch to Wigan and his £13m move to Everton plus Brian Easton’s £350,000 switch to Burnley. So much for provincial clubs being unable to turn a coin post-Bosman.

The conveyer belt just keeps turning. Ali Crawford, Stephen Hendrie and Ziggy Gordon are just a few of the names seemingly destined for bigger things as direct a result of being regularly exposed to the demands of the professional game from a young age.

‘It has been amazing,’ said McArthur with no little understatement. ‘Alex Neil has done a remarkable job in the time he has been involved. Billy Reid needs to get credit, as well, because he took these kids, nurtured them and brought them through. Alex took it on from there.

‘Giving players a chance is the reason why they’ve done so well. You look at the boys who are there - they have not just become good players this year. They’ve played 80-100 games and learned a way of playing.

‘When you play reserve football, you don’t get as much out of it. You only learn so much. They are getting the chance to learn the right way and when you need to go and win a first-team match, you are playing for your career, really.

‘Hamilton are a prime example ... not of the way Scottish football has to go, but in the way they are producing young talent. I think that’s good for the Scotland national team, as well.’

From his own perspective, McArthur finds it impossible to underplay the role the club played in making him into an English Premier League player with international credentials.

Asked bluntly if he’d be weighing up the possibility of playing against Georgia on Saturday had he started out elsewhere, he replied: ‘I don’t think I would be. I really believe that being at a club like Hamilton and getting that chance to progress is vital.

‘If you were at another club, you might not get that chance. You play reserve football and don’t progress as fast. I owe a lot personally to Hamilton.

‘I played quite a lot of games and the boys there now have done that, as well, and you learn from playing games.

‘From a personal point of view, I wouldn’t have changed anything – I would always have wanted to be at a club like Hamilton. It’s a small club but it’s run so well. They are such a good club – everyone is so close.

‘But they deserve that (financial rewards), not only for our transfers but for the work they are doing behind the scenes. Starting kids at a young, young age takes time and money and they will continue to progress as a club.’

Perhaps it was the loyalty that Accies seem to instil in their players that led to McArthur thinking twice when Wigan’s own story turned sour a year ago.

Relegation – even if it did come on the back of an FA Cup – might have been the signal for key players to agitate but a sense of personal responsibility kicked in.

‘It’s where everyone wants to be,’ the 27-year-old said of the top division. ‘But I wanted to stay with Wigan last year and get the club back into the Premier League because I was part of the team that went down so was partly to blame when they got relegated.

‘Everyone had to take their share of responsibility for that so I wanted to stay and try to get them promoted.

‘It didn’t work out like that. I wanted to give it a year and an opportunity came to get back in the Premier League and I’m happy it went through.’

McArthur’s contentment at his new club is understandable. As Palace’s record signing, he was the man the incoming Neil Warnock was prepared to move heaven and earth to land on deadline day. Two defeats in six matches suggest the disquiet that engulfed the club following Tony Pulis’s shock departure has long blown over.

‘It’s been brilliant,’ he added. ‘The lads are great and we’ve done fine as well, which makes it more enjoyable as well. The manager is very good. I’m happy because he signed me but he keeps everybody in high spirits and is a good laugh. He’s got us organised and we are getting results from it.

‘He has got a funny side to him and that’s good because managers can be too serious sometimes.

‘He builds a happiness in the camp and everyone feeds off that, but when it’s time to do business, he is ready to work hard.’

As was pointed out to him, he might as well have been talking about Gordon Strachan. Also a man who preaches the importance of ensuring the whole of greater than the sum of the parts in any team, the Scotland manager is a stated admirer of McArthur.

At Ibrox on Saturday, though, dilemmas abound. Charlie Mulgrew may be missing but the return of Scott Brown, the continuing presence of Darren Fletcher and the omnipresent James Morrison make central midfield places hard to come by.

‘It’s not just the midfield – all the way through the squad there’s competition,’ McArthur continued. ‘It’s the best squad I’ve been involved with. It’s getting harder and harder for the manager to pick the team. That can only be a good thing.’

Whatever side Strachan does select, and no matter the pre-match platitudes, Georgia at home has ‘must win’ stamped all over it.

That sense of injustice felt by all in the immediate aftermath of a narrow defeat to Germany was all very well but only by making an authoritative start to the first home match will the sense of belief continue.

‘I think we take a hell of a lot from that performance,’ McArthur reflected ‘We were playing against the world champions and we ran them very close.

‘We want to win every game and we will go into this one trying to get three points as we do in every match. We believe we can do that so we’ll try our best.’
