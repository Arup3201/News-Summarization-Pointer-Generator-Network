This is the terrifying moment a motorist reached 208mph in his Lamborghini before crashing into a ditch - and miraculously walked away unscathed.

The reckless driver took a friend for a spin on the motorway in the brand new £186,000 Lamborghini Huracan.

Footage taken on the passenger's mobile phone shows the Italian supercar's V10 engine roaring as it reaches a staggering 336kph (208mph).

Police in Hungary released the footage to act as a warning stopping other motorists from speeding

But as the driver heads towards the red line of the rev counter, he loses control of the bright green Lamborghini and screams are heard inside the car.

He then clips a railing before crossing the road and ending up in a ditch. At this point the Lamborghini caught fire and was burnt beyond recognition.

Incredibly, the driver walked away from the wreck, rescuing his injured friend from the car who spent eight days in hospital.

The crash took place on the M7 motorway in Hungary in September, with police releasing footage and images from the incident as a warning to motorists.

Police have charged the driver with numerous offences.

The motorist was driving a Lamborghini Huracan similar to the one pictured, which are valued at £186,000
