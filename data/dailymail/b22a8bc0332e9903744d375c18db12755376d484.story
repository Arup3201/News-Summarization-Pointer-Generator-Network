Manchester United and Chevrolet have released a video teaser ahead of the first Red Devils kit to be sponsored by the American car manufacturer.

Chevrolet announced a world record Â£53million sponsorship deal with the Old Trafford club in 2012 and are set to unveil their first United kit this month.

The shirt sponsorship part of the seven-year deal begins with the 2014-15 season with the Chevrolet name and logo replacing Aon on the United shirt.

Starting point: The video opens with a man singing 'Glory, glory Man United' over 100 years ago

Evolution: Another, more recent, United fan is seen also singing the chant in another traditional United shirt

Legends: Former United players Sir Bobby Charlton and Denis Law feature in the video

The video charts United's kits through the years, showing how their sponsors have regularly changed, but it cuts off at the end before the Chevrolet top can be seen.

Chevrolet will becomes United's fifth shirt sponsor in their history after Sharp, Vodafone, AIG and AON.

Sir Bobby Charlton, Denis Law and other United legends feature in the video, which ends with Wayne Rooney saying: 'The shirt belongs to you. It always has, it always will.

New era: The video ends with current United players about to reveal the club's new shirt
