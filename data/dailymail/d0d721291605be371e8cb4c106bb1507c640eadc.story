After an NFL season to forget, Minnesota Vikings star running back Adrian Peterson celebrated his 30th birthday in style on Saturday with an extravagant Arabic-themed party in his home state of Texas.

Peterson is currently at the center of much speculation about who he’ll be playing for next season, but he put all that behind him at the weekend and took his own life into his hands as he entered his birthday bash on the back of camel.

The elaborate celebrations included costumes, an ice bar, a cake shaped like a middle eastern palace and a special guest appearance by actor Jamie Foxx who can be seen hamming it up on the dance-floor and in the DJ booth in cellphone footage that's appeared on social media since.

The big 3-0 typically signals the beginning of the end for an NFL running back, but Peterson didn’t let that spoil his fun on Saturday night.

The Vikings' all-time leading rusher appeared in only one game in 2014 because of the child abuse case that involved injuries to his 4-year-old son.

He was indicted on September 11, 2014, by a Montgomery County, Texas, grand jury on charges of reckless or negligent injury to a child that occurred on May 18, 2014.

He is accused of beating his four-year-old son with a tree branch, which Peterson consistently referred to as a 'switch', causing severe welts and bleeding on the child's back, legs, buttocks, genitals and ankles.

In their initial response, the Vikings deactivated Peterson for a single game.

Peterson’s 2014 NFL season was over after arbitrator Shyam Das ruled in favor of the NFL on November 18, 2014, saying, 'the league can keep Adrian Peterson on the commissioner’s exempt list,' effectively terminating the Minnesota Vikings running back's season.

His suspension, ordered by Commissioner Roger Goodell through at least April 15, was tabled after a federal judge knocked down the NFL arbitrator's denial of Peterson's appeal. 

Peterson was returned to the special exempt list, pending further developments on the legal front.

He has three years remaining on his Vikings contract and is owed $12.75 million next season, but relations between the two parties are currently described as tenuous.

While team officials have said they want Peterson back, he has questioned their commitment in the wake of the suspension controversy.

In an interview with ESPN last month, he called the collaboration between the Vikings and the NFL to place him on paid leave the week after he was indicted in Texas 'an ambush.'

Peterson's agent, Ben Dogra, said on Friday that he declined an invitation from Vikings general manager Rick Spielman to meet over dinner during the NFL owners meetings in Arizona next week. 

The Texan has featured in six Pro Bowl selections, run for 10,190 yards and scored 86 touchdowns since joining the NFL. He has only played for the Vikings since his league debut in 2007.

In 2012, Peterson rushed for 2,097 yards, finishing nine yards shy of breaking Eric Dickerson's all-time record for running yardage in a single NFL season.
