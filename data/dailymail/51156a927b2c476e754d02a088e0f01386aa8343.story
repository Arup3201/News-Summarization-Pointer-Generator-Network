A flasher who exposed himself to other shoppers in Sainsbury’s was caught after police traced his details through his Nectar card.

Keith Daniels, 57, was seen on CCTV watching two young girls who were leafing through magazines unaware that he was standing close behind them.

Store detectives were able to wind back the footage to the point where he had gone through the checkout and traced him through his Nectar card.

Jailed: Keith Daniels was sentenced to six months in prison at Exeter Crown Court (pictured) after he was caught on CCTV exposing himself in Sainsbury's

Daniels, of Ford Street, 
Drewsteignton, admitted outraging public decency and was jailed for six 
months, suspended for two years and ordered to receive 12 months 
supervision at Exeter Crown Court.

Mr Nigel Wraith, prosecuting, said a 
sales assistant spotted Daniels in the magazine aisle of the Alphington 
store in Exeter in August and alerted security staff.

He had already bought his shopping before he watched two girls aged 11 or 12 as he exposed himself.

When police showed him the CCTV footage, he denied the offence.

Judge Frances Gilbert, QC told 
Daniels: ‘You denied this offence in interview even after you were shown
the CCTV which showed exactly what you were doing.

A sales assistant at Sainsbury's spotted Daniels in the magazine aisle of the store and alerted security staff

‘You were seen by a lady sales assistant who was extremely shocked, alarmed and distressed by what she saw.

‘It is not surprising because this was
the most astonishing behaviour for somebody of your age and previous 
good character, or anyone for that matter.

‘To be doing it in Sainsbury, of all 
places, is a very serious offence which would have been even more 
serious if you had known or believed the children were watching you.

‘Fortunately they did not seem to be 
aware of what you were doing. I am passing a suspended sentence to deter
you from offending in this disgusting way again.

Daniels was traced back through his Nectar and bank card and denied the offence to police even when shown the CCTV footage

‘You must also undertake whatever 
programmes the probation service consider appropriate to prevent you 
from behaving in this way again.’

Mr Nick Bradley, defending, said 
Daniels now appreciates the seriousness of what he did and is keen to 
work with the probation service to prevent any recurrence.

He said: ‘It had not been his intention to cause anyone distress but he cannot give any rational explanation for his behaviour.’
