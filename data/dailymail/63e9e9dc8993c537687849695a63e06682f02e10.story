Audrey Hepburn's beehive, Elvis Presley's quiff and Jennifer Aniston's 'Rachel' cut were yesterday named among the most iconic hairstyles in history.

The Beehive, made famous by Hepburn's Breakfast At Tiffany's character Holly Golightly came top of a poll that listed the most memorable 'dos of the past half a century.

Elvis Presley's jet black quiff came second followed by Bob Marley's dreadlocks and the Rachel, the layered cut made famous by Jennifer Aniston during her stint as Rachel Green in hit TV show Friends.

Undoubtedly one of the most well known pictures of Audrey Hepburn, her role as Holly Golightly in Breakfast At Tiffany's saw her wear her hair piled on top of her head in a beehive

Hairstyles can become synonymous with characters, such as the 'Rachel' cut, made famous by Jennifer Aniston in Friends (left) and Elvis Presley's thick dark quiffed hair (right)

Amy Winehouse's ultra high beehive, Princess Diana's feathered pageboy style and BrigitteBardot's tousled bed head look also featured at the top of the list, put together to mark Toni & Guy's 50th anniversary.

Other iconic hairstyles among the top ten compiled from a poll of 2,000 Brits include The Beatles' matching mop tops, Marilyn Monroe's glamorous blonde curls and Farrah Fawcett's golden flicks.

Twiggy's demure elfin crop was voted into 11th place followed the quiff John Travolta wore when he played Danny Zuko in the 1970s film Grease.

Kate Middleton's long brunette curls came 13th, with James Dean's style, David Beckham's 90s curtains and Cher's waist-length, straight hair close behind.

Bob Marley, Jamaican singer-songwriter and musician, was renowned for his dreadlocks and they were voted third on the list

The glamorous bouffant worn by Jackie Kennedy is at 17, while Halle Berry's short pixie cut was at 18.

Dita Von Teese's retro curls and the famous Star Wars buns worn by Princess Leia completed the top 20.

It's not all glitz and glamour in the list though as even some of the most questionable styles from the last few decades feature among the top 50.

David Beckham's much criticised Mohawk is at number 21, while even Kevin Keegan's mullet made it in at number 31.

Current looks among the list include Holly Willoughby's long soft curls, One Direction heart-throb Harry Styles' messy locks and Zooey Deschanel's thick fringe.

The Duchess of Cambridge's classic, perfectly formed curls find their way onto the list at number 13

Other hairstyles featured include Bo Derek's cornrows, Victoria Beckham's 'pob' and Kylie Minogue's 80s perm.

Emma Bunton with her Baby Spice bunches, Alexa Chung and Kate Moss were also named as having memorable styles.

SurprisinglyDavid Beckham's much criticised Mohawk is at number 21

Even the Queen features in the list with her perfectly coiffed curls voted in at number 50.

Sacha Mascolo-Tarbuck, Global 
Creative Director for Toni & Guy, who conducted the survey, said: 'Audrey Hepburn's beehive in 
Breakfast At Tiffany's is a style almost everyone is familiar with, even
 if they have never seen the film.

'The
 image of her with her dark hair piled up while she is holding a 
cigarette holder is one of the most recognisable film images of all 
time.

'The
 fact that the famous style is still topping these kinds of lists half a
 century since the film was released shows how iconic it really is - and
 it gained even more fans when the film was re-released last year.

'The
 top ten features styles from across the last 50 or so years - from 
Hepburn's beehive, right through to Jennifer Aniston's face framing 
layers - and really show how style and fashion have evolved over the 
years.

'These
 styles are instantly recognisable, despite many of them being from a 
whole generation ago - and they will probably still be as iconic in 
generations to come.'
