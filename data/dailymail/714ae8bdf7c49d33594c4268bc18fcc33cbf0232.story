A group of Crystal Palace supporters - known as the Holmesdale Fanatics - unveiled a banner which stated they were against a 38th game being played abroad.

The fans, who congregate in the lower Holmesdale, displayed a banner during their side's Premier League game which was shown live on Sky.

'No to the 38th game abroad - English games on English soil,' read the banner.Â

Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore attended the match at Selhurst Park which could have been one of the reasons why the group of Palace fans decided to display the banner.

Palace supporters unveiled a banner before last month's Chelsea game which read 'Roman's dirty money is a disgrace that has plagued our game'.

They also protested against Sky's live coverage of Transfer Deadline Day.
