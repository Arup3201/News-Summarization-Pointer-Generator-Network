A Muslim terror leader whom the United States released from the Guantanamo Bay military prison camp in 2006 has sent at least 2,500 jihadis from Saudi Arabia and some from Yemen to join the self-proclaimed 'Islamic State' army in Syria and Iraq, according to a highly placed Pentagon source.

That's more than twice the number of jihadi soldiers killed in U.S.-led coalition airstrikes over ISIS-held territory in Syria and Iraq.

Ibrahim al-Rubaish, now the spiritual leader of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), was captured by American troops in 2001 and spent five years at 'Gitmo' before the George W. Bush administration released him into Saudi custody.

'There's no doubt that he's sending fighters,' the Department of Defense official told DailyMail.com on Wednesday. 'Twenty-five hundred is a conservative estimate.'

Ibrahim al-Rubaish was let go from Gitmo in 2006 along with 16 other prisoners, and quickly returned to al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula – becoming its Mufti, or spiritual leader – and he's now recruiting for ISIS

'The intel community as a whole is convinced he's [ISIS leader Abu Bakr] al-Baghdadi's link to Yemen,' he added.

'He manages to motivate a lot of Saudis too, even though he's persona non grata in the KSA,' he said, referring to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

The official refused to be identified because of the sensitive nature of the information, and because he is not authorized to speak to the press.

A second Pentagon official, lower-ranking but with knowledge of the Obama administration's tactical toolbox and Middle Eastern intelligence, confirmed the first source's account.

'That's correct,' he said in a phone interview when asked if al-Rubaish was sending large numbers of extremists to join ISIS.

'If we could get him back, we'd do it in a heartbeat. And there are more of them out there like him.'

He said some Guantanamo detainees spend time behind razor wire building networks and strategic connections that become useful once the United States government repatriates them.

'It could happen during recreation time, even during prayer time,' the official explained. 'They're always plotting, and when someone like [al-] Rubaish is sent home he leaves with a mental Rolodex of people in the movement – everyone his fellow detainees ever worked with or made common cause with.'

The Department of Defense wouldn't comment on al-Rubaish's ISIS recruiting, instead sending a generic statement recounting parts of his history.

'Ibrahim Al Rubaysh arrived at Guantanamo in 2002 and was transferred in 2006,' wrote Lt. Col. Myles B. Caggins III, a U.S. Army spokesman.

'Since 2009, the Defense Department and five government departments and agencies conduct thorough security and intelligence reviews prior to transferring Guantanamo detainees; more than 90 percent of detainees transferred during the Obama administration have resumed quiet lives in various countries.'

'I can't comment on behalf of security officials in Yemen or KSA,' he insisted.

The Saudi government includes al-Rubaish on its list of most wanted terrorists, and the United States is offering a $5 million reward for information that leads to his capture. 

In 2009 the Jamestown Foundation, a terror-tracking think tank, identified him as AQAP's 'Mufti,' or chief religious authority in Saudi Arabia and Yemen.

Al-Rubaish also has a college degree in Islamic shariah law.

According to the Middle East Media Research Institute, Al-Rubaish called for open holy war against Americans in 2013, saying: 'It is my duty to spur the Muslims to kill the Americans, to get them out of the Muslims' land.'

ISIS can muster up to 31,500 fighters, the Central Intelligence Agency reported in October.  

If that number is correct, al-Rubaish is responsible for mobilizing at least one out of every 13 ISIS fighters.

But Fuad Hussein, chief of staff to Kurdish President Massoud Barzani, said a month later that the CIA and other intelligence agencies dramatically underestimated the total.

Former President George W. Bush was under pressure in 2006 to release prisoners from Guantanamo, and did so a year after Vice President Dick Cheney warned against it

Pictured in 2002, the Guantanamo Bay military detention camp in Cuba became a repository for the worst terrorists captured after the 9/11 attacks in 2001, but the Bush and Obama administrations mostly emptied it

'I am talking about hundreds of thousands of fighters because they are able to mobilize Arab young men in the territory they have taken,' Hussein told The Independent last month.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a nonprofit monitoring group, said Tuesday that it has counted 1,171 casualties and 800 wounded, mostly ISIS members, as a consequence of U.S.-led bombing raids.

Thousands more have died during ground battles with the Iraqi Army and Kurdish Peshmerga forces.

The Bush administration released more than 500 prisoners from Guantanamo, mostly by handing them over to other countries.

President Barack Obama continued that trend, pledging during his 2008 political campaign to close 'Gitmo' completely.

His most controversial Guantanamo releases were five top Taliban fighters whom he traded for the safe return of Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl in May.

Even then he acknowledged that that decision could come back to haunt the United States. 

'Is there the possibility of some of them trying to return to activities that are detrimental to us? Absolutely,' he acknowledged three days later during a press conference in Poland.

'That's been true of all the prisoners that were released from Guantanamo,' Obama said. 'There's a certain recidivism rate that takes place.'

The Obama administration is scrambling to track down al-Rubaish, whose Arabic name is spelled several different ways in English. 

The Pentagon insists that it continues to take precautions before releasing prisoners

PINPRICK? U.S.-led coalition airstrikes have killed more than 1,000 ISIS fighters, but al-Rubaish has sent more than twice that number into battle on his own

Nine years ago, then-Vice President Dick Cheney warned against emptying out Guantanamo for the same reason.

'If you were to release those 520 [detainees] that are currently held at Guantanamo that have been deemed to be enemy combatants, we're putting a lot of bad guys back on the street to do exactly what they started to do in the first place,' he said in 2005 at the National Press Club.

A year later the Pentagon released al-Rubaish into a Saudi 'rehabilitation' program designed to reintegrate jihadis into society. He escaped and fled to Yemen, leaving his wife and three children behind.

Now at the top of AQAP's religious pecking order, however, he has reportedly urged some of his ISIS-bound followers to bring their sons with them.

'You know there are little terrorist-training schools in Syria?' DailyMail.com's first Defense Department source said Tuesday. 'Those aren't all Syrian 10-year-olds. Foreign fighters from all over are traveling with sons. Mostly teenagers, but some are much younger.'

The office of the Director of National Intelligence reported ni 2013 that 171 detainees Guantanamo prisoners released during the Bush years were confirmed or suspected of having re-engaged in hostilities.

Judicial Watch, a center-right research organization known for collecting documents via Freedom of Information Act requests, first publicized on Monday that the U.S. State Department had offered a $5 million bounty for al-Rubaish.

Tom Fitton, the group's president, said Tuesday that the AQAP Mufti stood as 'a dramatic illustration of the danger of releasing these terrorists.'

'The recidivism rate is dangerously high, and to release terrorists in the middle of ongoing wars in Afghanistan, the Middle East, is reckless,' he said.

He said the Saudi program into which al-Rubaish was released 'had a recidivism rate of about 20 per cent.'
