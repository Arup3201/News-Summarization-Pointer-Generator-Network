This is the first picture of President Francois Hollande and all three of his women - his girlfriend, his mistress and the mother of his four children.

In the photograph from Hollande's 2012 presidential campaign, he is seen shaking hands with Valerie Trierweiler as his alleged mistress, actress Julie Gayet, looks on, with his ex-partner Segolène Royal a few feet away.

The picture emerged as it was revealed that First Lady Trierweiler took ‘one pill too many’ because the ‘cold and ruthless’ Hollande wanted to dump her.

All in one: President Hollande can be seen shaking the hand of Valerie Trierweiler during the 2012 election campaign in the presence of Segolène Royal, who is the mother of his children, (far left) and his alleged mistress French actress Julie Gayet (in black, far right)

The 48-year-old is said to have taken 
pills following the public revelation of the 59-year-old President’s 
deceit with another lover.

By
 tomorrow Ms Trierweiler will have spent an entire week in hospital, yet
 the Socialist head of state has not visited her, instead sending 
‘chocolates and flowers’.

Such details are contained in the 
latest edition of Le Point which, along with other publications 
‘favoured’ by Ms Trierweiler, has led coverage of the growing scandal in
 France.

‘She took a pill too many,’ one source tells the Paris magazine. ‘However, she never wanted to attempt suicide.’

The
 source goes on to describe Mr Hollande as being ‘cold and ruthless’ 
when he confessed to his affair with Julie Gayet, the 41 year old Paris 
actress.

Plus one? French President Francois Hollande, right, offers a rose to his partner Valerie Trierweiler in 2012. Allegations have arisen that he has a long-standing affair with an actress

Le Nouvel 
Observateur, which has outstanding Elysee Palace contacts, said Mr 
Hollande wanted to split up with Ms Trierweiler, but her sudden 
hospitalisation meant she could not.

‘François Hollande had a dream but it only lasted the weekend,’ said the left wing weekly.

Mr
 Hollande had hoped, the magazine claimed, to get his official partner 
to sign a joint announcement of their separation on Saturday.

With a crucial conference before the world’s press scheduled for Tuesday he thought this would be the ‘least worst solution’.

But by Sunday night, Mr Hollande abandoned the plan, because he feared it would make him look cruel and insensitive.

Now
 Ms Trierweiler has ‘not the slightest intention of packing her bags’, 
with the magazine stating: ‘OK to forgive, but not OK to leave.’

Mr
 Hollande speaks to the health care team at Le Petite Salpetriere 
hospital, where Princess Diana died in 1997, reveals Le Point, but has 
been advised to stay away because his first lady is being treated for 
psychological problems.

If 
follows equally damaging claims that Ms Gayet boasted about her affair 
with an ‘older man in politics’ just a few months after he came to 
power.

Revelations
 about 41-year-old Julie Gayet's relationship with the portly Socialist,
 who turns 60 this year, emerged as she remained in hiding.

Affair: Hollande is alleged to be having an affair with French actress Julie Gayet

It is now a week since the usually high-profile and easily recognisable film actress disappeared from public view.

Ms Gayet's love rival, de facto first 
lady Valerie Trierweiler, meanwhile remains in a central Paris hospital 
where she has been since finding out about Mr Hollande's cheating.

Despite
 Mr Hollande's insistence that the scandal is a 'private matter' which 
should be kept 'secret', Ms Gayet is the cover girl in the latest 
edition of French Elle.

In it she is quoted as telling a friend 'more
 than a year ago' that she has found an 'older man, very different from 
earlier boyfriends, who is in politics.'

This raises the prospect
 that Mr Hollande started the affair within a few months of being sworn 
in as French president in May 2012.

It was around this time that
 Ms Trierweiler, a journalist for Paris Match magazine, began to restyle
 herself as France's first lady.

This entitled her to five permanent 
staff, and numerous other perks, including limousines, private jets and 
homes all over France.

Conference: Hollande spoke at a press conference at the Elysee Palace

While not making any official public 
comment, Ms Trierweiler has made her own views perfectly clear in the 
latest edition of Paris Match, which runs a glowing profile of her.

'There
 is no worse poison than indifference,' is a phrase widely being 
attribute to her - suggesting that Mr Hollande has been distracted from 
his relationship with her for a long time.

He is not thought to have even visited Ms Trierweiler at the Petite Salpetriere hospital since she checked in last Friday.

Magazine Paris Match, which 
employs her as a book critic, reported she had not been visited by 
Hollande. She reportedly suffered a 'nervous breakdown' when she learned
 of the claims. 

The Times 
reports deputy editor Catherine Schwaab wrote the piece which appeared 
to be trying to boost the reviewer's popularity.

Mr
 Hollande, who has been sneaking off on a scooter for trysts with Ms 
Gayet in a flat 150 yards from the Elysee, told a Paris press conference
 on Tuesday that he would make his mind up about who his first lady was 
by February 11th.

This is the date that he is due to be in Washington for a meeting with President Barack Obama, and first lady Michelle Obama.
