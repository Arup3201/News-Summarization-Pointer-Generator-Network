A fire has ripped through a popular inner Melbourne restaurant, forcing the evacuation of diners and causing more than $400,000 worth of damage.

About 50 people were enjoying dinner at Donovans Restaurant, St Kilda, when the fire broke out in its roof above the kitchen on Sunday evening.

Owners Gail and Kevin Donovan bought the restaurant in 1995.

'I have absolutely no idea how the fire started, it's completely bizarre,' Ms Donovan told the Herald Sun.

Metropolitan Fire Brigade (MFB) firefighters said no one was injured and they were able bring it under control in 50 minutes.

They stopped it from spreading.

The damage bill is more than $400,000 and its cause is being investigated, A MFB statement said.

The site of Donovans was one of three original bathing houses built in 1920 on the St Kilda foreshore.

A passer-by reportedly spotted smoke coming from the restaurant's roof and alerted staff.

Chef Andrew Craig said: 'We didnâ€™t even know it had happened until one of the wait staff saw the flames and smoke coming from outside the restaurant.'

Ms Donovan promised to rebuild her business and added: 'We love it and adore it, and hopefully the damage will all just be internal.'

MFB Commander Bruce Pickthall told 3AW radio: 'They're prepared to make Donovan's bigger and better than it was and thankfully St Kilda has still got one of its iconic buildings.

'It will come back. It will be trading in no time.'

The fire at Donovans comes after the iconic Stokehouse restaurant, on St Kilda beach, was also destroyed by a fire in January this year.

Around 200 customers were forced to flee and more than 70 firefighters battled for three hours to control the blaze.
