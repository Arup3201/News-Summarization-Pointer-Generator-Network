Scotland Yard was last night facing demands to say if it has a copy of a missing dossier containing explosive claims of a Westminster paedophile ring.

Campaigning MP Simon Danczuk called on the Metropolitan Police to reveal what information is in its hands after The Mail on Sunday was given the first indication that the bombshell file had been found.

A Freedom of Information response about the documents – believed to name up to eight public figures involved in child sex abuse but lost or shredded by the Home Office – confirmed ‘the requested information is held’ by Britain’s biggest force.

But the Yard has refused to set out exactly what information it has found – even though a fresh search is under way in Home Office archives for the missing files compiled by the late Tory MP Geoffrey Dickens.

Last night Scotland Yard was told to come clean about what it has – or risk fresh accusations of a cover-up.

Mr Danczuk , the Labour MP for Rochdale who has helped uncover allegations of a Westminster abuse scandal including the scale of offending by the late Cyril Smith, said: ‘The Met need to confirm or deny whether they hold what they believe to be the Dickens dossier. I think they have a duty – not just to the Home Office and the inquiry but to the public.

‘They have a responsibility to assist in terms of confirming whether the dossier exists or not.

‘It would be pretty appalling if they chose to hide the fact that they held the Dickens dossier.

‘It could be that they failed to act on what’s in the dossier and they are trying to keep a low profile in the hope it blows over.’

He made his demands after an FOI request by this newspaper gave the first hint that the Met may have the sought-after dossier.

The MoS asked this March for access to files on the investigations the Met carried out into the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange and all the documents it received on the group and its members, including those sent by Dickens, who died in 1995.

The Yard’s FOI team replied in June, refusing to release the information in case it interfered with investigations, and to avoid revealing personal information. But within the five-page letter were several hints that the Met had indeed found the documents compiled by Dickens.

It stated: ‘The searches located records relevant to your request… I have considered your request for information within the provisions set out by the Act and can confirm that the requested information is held by the MPS.

‘Having located and considered the relevant information, I am afraid that I am not required by statute to release the information requested. I have applied this exemption in that the names and personal details of any living individuals identified in the reports constitute personal data which would, if released, be in breach of the rights provided by the DPA.’

But a spokesman for the force said last night the admissions in the FOI response should not be taken as confirmation that the force did have the particular dossier given by Dickens to the Home Office.

He said: ‘The Freedom of Information response makes it clear that records relevant to the request are held. However it does not indicate what those records are and it would be wrong to use that FOI response as confirmation that specific documents are held.’

The spokesman declined to answer specific questions on what documents it did have and when it had found them, and would only add: ‘The Metropolitan Police Service will fully co-operate with the review led by Peter Wanless and the panel chaired by Baroness Butler-Sloss and provide detail of relevant information.

‘Whilst these and live police investigations are ongoing, it would be inappropriate to comment on this further.’

Dickens said on one occasion he had handed over ‘eight names of big people, really important names’ including a former friend of his.

Other files were said to expose ‘paedophilia in Buckingham Palace and the diplomatic and civil services’ and a ‘top television executive’ as well as ‘child abuse and sex assaults at a children’s home’.
