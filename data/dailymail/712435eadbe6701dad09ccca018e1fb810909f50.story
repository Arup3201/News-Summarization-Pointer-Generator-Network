Pie Face fans could be buying their favourite Australian pastries from the freezer section of Woolworths early next year, in a move that could potentially save the struggling franchise. 

The pie company is in talks with the supermarket giant to sell their products frozen and in bulk, with a trial already under way in 15 stores, according to Fairfax.

The sale-boosting business move has come only a few weeks after Pie Face announced it was entering into voluntary administration to restructure the business in an effort to cut costs.

Kevin Waite, the company's CEO, assured that franchises would prosper from the strategy, which is still under consideration, saying he believed Pie Face had a 'strong future'.

'The customer normally going into a Pie Face for hot pies doesn't swap their purchasing occasion by buying a frozen pie for diner,' Mr Waite told Fairfax.

The founder of Pie Face, former Wall Street banker Wayne Homschek, said sections of the franchise, 'were still profitable'

'We'll make sure it's a different shopping occasion. Our franchisees are first and foremost in everything we do.'

Despite insisting that it was 'business as usual' following their restructure announcement, 19 Pie Face stores closed last week while Fairfax reports that the company owes $20 million to its creditors.

The founder of Pie Face, former Wall Street banker Wayne Homschek, gave his global company over to the advisory and consulting firm, Jirsch Sutherland, who are 'conducting a review of operations', Fairfax reports. 

Rod Sutherland from Jirsch Sutherland confirmed that some of the company's stores were losing money.

However, Mr Homschek told Fairfax that sections of the franchise, which is known to sell meat pies, pastries and sandwiches until the early hours of the morning, were 'still profitable'

'We're potentially going to refinance Macquarie Capital and are looking at bringing in new senior lenders,' Mr Homschek said.

Pie Face was founded in 2003 with the first 20 stores opening within the first five years of the company's launch. 

The company assured that their 'international businesses are not affected' as two stores prepared to open in the Middle East in November.
