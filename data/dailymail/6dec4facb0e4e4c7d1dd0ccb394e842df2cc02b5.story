A video of a precocious five-year-old doling out some sage advice to his crying sister has scooped an impressive $10,000 prize on America’s Funniest Home Videos.

The clip shows Charlotte Carr, two, sobbing at her family's kitchen table in Canal Winchester, Ohio, only to be reprimanded by her exasperated older brother Wesley.

'Did you have a nap today?' he asks matter-of-factly, while glaring at his emotional sibling.

'I didn't!' she responds, sobbing.

Rather than asking what has upset her, Wesley delivers some tough love, simply replying: 'Well, you need one.'

Charlotte remains unimpressed with Wesley's advice, grabbing his arm while insisting: 'No, I don't!'

Important question: 'Did you have a nap today?' Wesley calmly asked Charlotte as she sobbed

Pillow talk: 'Well, you need one,' Wesley advised after Charlotte admitted she hadn't had a nap

The children's father, Jared Carr, told Daily Mail Online that Wesley has always had a 'great relationship' with his little sister. 

'They certainly have their moments of fighting, pestering and competing like most young siblings, but are mostly pleasant with one another. Wes has a tender heart and it's not uncommon for him to run to his sister to comfort her if she's upset.'

Mr  Carr added: 'Wes is wise beyond his years. He’s had a lot of experience with little ones. He has two small cousins close by. He's pretty sharp and soaks up a lot of what mom and dad say. I do think he doesn't like to see her cry…especially if it's because she's in trouble. A lot of times he’ll advise her on what to do, trying to steer her out of trouble.'

The reason for Charlotte's tears, he added, was a lack of interest in the dinner options he was offering her.

While Mr Carr doesn't usually record his children crying, he wanted their mother to witness Charlotte's stubborn reaction when she returned home.

'Most parents know that sometimes your kids are having such a meltdown it's almost funny,' he added. 

Both children were very excited about winning a prize on America's Funniest Home Videos - but Wesley more than Charlotte. 

Mr Carr said: 'He had some ideas on how we should spend the money. Charlotte was probably more excited about the plane ride and candy backstage.'

The 13-second video has garnered nearly 1.8 views on YouTube since it was posted on January 5.
