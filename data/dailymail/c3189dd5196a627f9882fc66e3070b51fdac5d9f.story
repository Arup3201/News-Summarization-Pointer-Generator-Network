They seem a most unlikely opening partnership but former England batsman Geoffrey Boycott was pictured with American pop star Katy Perry on Wednesday - and predictably he played it with a straight bat.

While Boycott is often critical of another KP, Kevin Pietersen, he has nothing but praise for the singer, with whom he has a long-standing affinity.

The Yorkshireman acknowledged that he was a fan of Perry while on the BBC's Test Match Special two years ago.

'I like that Katy Perry,' he said. 'She's a good singer. Firework.

'She's nice, her. She's good. She's tops for me. She just has something about her voice - it's good and strong.

'I don't think I'll ever meet her.'

Russell Brand's former wife Perry then urged Boycott to show her the 'Yorkshire countryside' in August.

'Hey Geoffrey, it's Katy Perry. I just think you're beautiful and your style is stunning,' she said in a message on the BBC.

Show me around! Perry said in August that she wanted a tour of the Yorkshire countryside

'When I'm next in the UK you'll have to show me around the Yorkshire countryside.'

And Boycott's dream came true this week when the pair met up.

Whether
 it beat scoring his hundredth hundred during an Ashes Test at Headingley
 is another matter, but meeting Perry certainly seemed to hit him for six...
