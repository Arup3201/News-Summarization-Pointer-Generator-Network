David Beckham was in attendance at the launch of his whisky brand 'Haig Club' in London on Sunday night.

The former Manchester United midfielder was alongside his wife Victoria at Wellington Arch, where he hosted a lavish dinner party at a pop-up bar.

The venue, also called 'Haig Club', has been set up for one week to celebrate the launch of Beckham's whisky, and is styled to emulate the original 1920s Haig Club 'Clubman Series' adverts.

When it was announced in April 2014 that Beckham was going to release the new brand of whisky, he said: 

'The House of Haig has a rich history and I'm proud to be working at the heart of a home-grown brand which has built an incredible heritage over 400 years.'

Meanwhile, Beckham's son Brooklyn was in attendance at Wembley for Chelsea's Capital One Cup victory over Tottenham.

The 15-year-old watched the game with his aunt Joanne, posting the photo to his Instagram site later in the evening.

As revealed by Sportsmail last week, Brooklyn is expected to be left disappointed in his attempts to secure an Arsenal scholarship.

He is currently enrolled at the club's Hale End academy and was hoping to extend his current deal by two years, but it is understood the teenager will not be retained next season.
