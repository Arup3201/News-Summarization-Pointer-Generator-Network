When the USA play their historic match against the All Blacks in Chicago on November 1, they are destined to be at full strength, with all their English-based players available. But there will be a price.

It was reported in the States this week that USA Rugby have an agreement with Aviva Premiership clubs which will see their American players released en masse for the clash with the world champions at Soldier Field. Even though the fixture falls outside the official Test ‘window’, the likes of Northampton No 8 Samu Manoa, Leicester wing Blaine Scully and Saracens’ utility back Chris Wyles are all due to be available.

It was claimed that a deal has been struck by the chief executive of USA Rugby, ex-England captain Nigel Melville, to secure the services of these players and several others for the high-profile visit of New Zealand, in return for them being sent back to their clubs for the rest of November. That would mean they are not able to take part in subsequent matches against Romania, Tonga and Fiji.

Sportsmail has been told that a firm agreement is not yet in place, but that talks are on-going. It is understood that the IRB will not seek to take any action in defence of their Regulation Nine, governing player release, due to the unique circumstances surrounding the USA-All Blacks fixture.

On the one hand, this is understandable, to a degree. The world governing body recognise the symbolic importance of a New Zealand visit to America, as it may have a galvanising effect on a potentially vast and largely untapped market.

For Melville and USA Rugby, it is reasonable to throw all the autumn eggs into one basket this time, knowing they must put their best foot forward when they have the attention of the nation. They can also use the remaining games as opportunities for experimentation. And the Premiership clubs want some payback if they are to release players when they don’t have to.

But long-term, this can’t carry on. Regulation Nine is the hottest potato in the game. Clubs and countries are vying for the same players in a congested calendar. The result is bartering and horse-trading, temporary solutions and a patching-up of disputes.

There needs to be more permanent clarity. Fixtures must be reduced and ring-fenced. Test teams should expect access at the right times, but not keep expanding their schedules. Australia are playing five matches in Europe next month, at the end of a shattering season. It is money-driven madness.

Play less, pay less, stop haggling, prioritise the welfare of players and their right to represent their country – and don’t undermine the sport with over-kill.

As the Steffon Armitage saga rumbles on, it is understood that Dan Lydiate may soon be on his way back from Racing Metro to Wales, while there has also been speculation about Jamie Roberts’ future in Paris. Neither man has made a substantial impact across the Channel, partly due to injuries and irregular selection. Lydiate has been strongly linked with the Ospreys and that prospect should appeal to the Lions flanker. The Swansea-based region are enjoying a wonderful resurgence – as the only unbeaten team in Europe’s three main leagues – without the cast-list of Galacticos that they had in previous years. Dan Baker is making waves at No 8, as is Eli Walker on the wing, allied to the astute control of Wales half-backs Rhys Webb and Dan Biggar. The Ospreys have the look of a side who are well coached, which is a tribute to Steve Tandy and his staff. It is also fitting encouragement for Alun Wyn Jones, the captain who turned down a pile of Euros, stayed loyal and is now leading a hungry, upwardly-mobile squad. Lydiate could do worse than jump aboard the bandwagon.

England scrum half Danny Care is back from a fleeting paternity break to join the start of Harlequins’ assault on the new European Champions Cup, at home to Castres on Friday night. The visitors come to The Stoop without the array of international Test firepower at the disposal of some leading French sides, but they do have two exiled Scots, in the towering shape of Lions lock Richie Gray and the centre Max Evans. They also have a dangerous flanker, Ibrahim Diarra, who almost single-handedly ran Northampton ragged at Franklin’s Gardens four years ago, before celebrating his Man of the Match award with a post-match, pitch-side cigarette. It was an indication of the enduring cultural differences within European rugby, but if he tries to smoke at the ground tonight, the stewards won’t stand for it, even if he has just lit up the game…

They should have given him a mask and cape for the occasion. Australia are in meltdown, with backs to the wall, so they’ve sent for Quade Cooper to save their skins. The maverick playmaker is back from injury and on the bench for Saturday’s dead-rubber Bledisloe Cup game against New Zealand and embattled coach Ewen McKenzie must hope that the fly-half can deliver an inspirational cameo in his home city of Brisbane. ‘It’s an attitude thing,’ said Cooper – whose own attitude has been repeatedly questioned in the past. ‘The attitude is something we can really pick up.’ He’s right about that one. The Wallabies are in utter disarray, so even showing some unity and honour in near-certain defeat would be an improvement.

Last Word – When Clermont Auvergne beat Saracens in the 2012 Heineken Cup quarter-final in Watford, they brought 2,000 supporters to Vicarage Road and the raucous ‘yellow army’ illuminated a drab venue. On Saturday, there are likely to be around 50 fans from the French club at Allianz Park for the same fixture. They have evidently opted to save their travel budget for another occasion, but in many cases, rugby is not doing very well when it comes to enticing visiting spectators. Kick-off times are becoming more absurd with every passing season – geared towards on-screen viewing figures, not in-ground attendances. This Sunday, Wasps face Leinster at 5.15pm, while the December fixtures announced last Friday have Leicester hosting champions Toulon at Welford Road at 5.30pm on a Sunday. These are not fan-friendly times. The same can be said for Friday-night internationals in particular, not least when they involve crossing the Severn Bridge in rush hour. One theory is that some clubs don’t tend to bring many supporters with them, so there is no need to cater for their needs – well, they never will if their needs continue to be shamefully ignored.
