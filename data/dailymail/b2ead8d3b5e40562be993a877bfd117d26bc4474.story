This is the moment a three-time Rubik's Cube world champion pushes his skills to the limit as he races against the clock in shark-infested waters.

Kevin Hays, 20, from Renton, Washington, took to the shores of Honolulu, Hawaii, for a spot of puzzle solving while cage diving.

Footage shows him submerged underwater, wearing a snorkel mask, quickly shifting the multi-colored squares of a 3 x 3 cube around. 

He told Daily Mail Online that he held his breathe for the duration instead of using an oxygen tank.

In the video, it appears that Hays' nerves got the better of him the first time around.

As a shark swims behind him, he swiftly stops what he's doing and watches the sharp-toothed animal glide by.

The maths whizz then gears up for a second attempt.

This time he has no problem completing the puzzle. In just 15 seconds the Rubik's Cube is pieced back together and Hays happily shows it to the camera.

He then goes up for air. Hays said that along with the sharks, the ocean's current added an element of difficulty.

'The shark tank was really rocky since the waves were pushing it around a ton, so that made it pretty hard to do the solves.'

It's not the first time Hays has solved a Rubik's Cube underwater.

Last year he completed three puzzles - a 2x2, a 3x3 and a 4x4 - in one minute. 

However, he stuck to the safety of a swimming pool on that occasion.

As a result of his endeavors, he went on to earn the nickname: 'Genius fish human.' 

Hays started puzzle solving as a high school freshman and, at one point, trained up to three hours a day.

Well-earned: Now in his final year of a math and computer science degree at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, Hays plans on taking a break from speed-solving after the summer

He is currently the world champion in the 5x5, 6x6 and 7x7 Rubik's Cubes and has smashed 11 world records.

Now in his final year of a math and computer science degree at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri, Hays plans on taking a break from speed-solving after the summer.

However, before his hiatus he will participate in a number of contests including championships in Tennessee, South Carolina and Brazil.

Offering tips to other Rubik's Cube enthusiasts, Hays previously said: 'It’s not as much math as you might think.

'It’s more pattern recognition and muscle memory execution. 

'You need the kind of mind that can see something and then immediately associate it with what you have to do.'
