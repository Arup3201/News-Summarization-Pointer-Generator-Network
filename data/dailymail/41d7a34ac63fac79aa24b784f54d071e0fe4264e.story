Republicans are poised to replicate the party's historic 2010 mid-term election victory in the House of Representatives, a new Pew poll finds.

If the election were held today, Republicans would win the House again, the poll indicates. Pew reports that 47 percent of respondents would vote for the Republican candidate for Congress, whereas 43 percent would vote for the Democrat.

By comparison, Republicans and Democrats were tied at 44 percent at this point in 2010 when Republicans won the majority, giving House Minority Leader John Boehner of Ohio the Speaker's gavel. The GOP trailed by two percentage points in Pew's poll when a wave of Republicans were elected in the 1994 mid-terms.

Pew's poll, taken in conjunction with USA Today in late April, echos a Washington Post - ABC poll released last week that also found that Republican congressional candidates had the edge over Democrats.

Republicans already hold a 33 seat advantage over Democrats in the 435 seat legislature. They are unlikely to lose the majority in the majority in November's election unless Democrats are able to change the momentum.

'This latest poll is yet another wake up call for House Democrats to what we already know – ObamaCare’s disastrous effects on people’s healthcare, President Obama's broken promises, and the economy’s dismal performance are all sinking them in 2014,' National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Andrew Clark told MailOnline in an email.

'Every vulnerable House Democrat should start re-assessing their support for ObamaCare and the White House’s failing economic agenda before the voters get their say in November.'

Respondents to Pew's poll named the economy and healthcare as their top concerns. By a margin of 43 to 39 percent, people polled said they believed the policies being perused by GOP leadership would be more likely to strengthen the economy than those of Democrats.

Democrats' lucky break could come in the form of Tea Party 'extremists' challenging Republican Party favorites, Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, pictured here in October, argued on Meet the Press a few days before the poll was taken in April

Democrats' lucky break could come in the form of Tea Party 'extremists' challenging Republican Party favorites, Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz argued on Meet the Press a few days before the polls were taken.

'You have the Republican Party who is strangled by the Tea Party,' she said. 'And we have countless 
elections now that Democrats have won because the Republicans have 
nominated extremists that their voters reject. And that's the advantage 
we will have going into this election.'

Each party's candidates will be determined by a series of primaries beginning this month. In 2010 the GOP took back the House, yet failed to gain control of the Senate after several Tea Party-backed candidates won their primaries but crashed and burned in the general election. Democrats carried the Senate in 2012, as well, as down ballot candidates benefited from President Barack Obama's re-election.

Democrats have their own set of problems to worry about head of November's elections, including low turn out among demographic groups that helped propel President Obama to victory in 2008 and 2012.

As Wasserman Schultz noted, her party's turnout efforts 'ran circles' around the GOP's efforts in 2008 and 2012. That was not the case during the last two mid-term elections, however.

African-Americans, a solidly Democratic voting block, came out in proportionally lower numbers than white voters in the last 
two midterm elections in all but a handful states. In the years President Obama
 was elected, black voter participation was only slightly lower than 
white voter participation.

Furthermore, President Obama is not as popular as he was throughout his first-term and 2012 re-election. Both the Pew poll and the WaPo-ABC poll found that Obama's approval rating had sunk to an all-time low at just 44 percent.

Wasserman Schultz refused to acknowledge the effect Obama's unpopularity could have on the upcoming elections, saying November would 'absolutely not' be a referendum on the president.

'These elections, particularly the 
Senate elections, are referendums on the candidates running,' she said.

The six official party committees have already raised more than $500 million dollars to spend on this year's races. That amount does not include money that will be spent by outside organizations. Including the money from those organization's, Democrats have a roughly 30 percent advantage over Republicans, The Huffington Post estimated in mid-April.
