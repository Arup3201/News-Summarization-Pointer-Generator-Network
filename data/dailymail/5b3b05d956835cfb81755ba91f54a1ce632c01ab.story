Private hospitals have offered doctors six-figure sums to refer patients to them over rivals, a major investigation has revealed.

The doctors' regulator, the General Medical Council (GMC), failed to act after receiving evidence of widespread payments to consultants in private practice in exchange for referrals to certain hospital groups, particularly those in London, it has been claimed.

The discovery has prompted a leading medical journal to call for doctors in the UK to be forced to declare their financial interests. 

The report published in the BMJ is based on an investigation by a major health insurance company, which uncovered 'covert' schemes often worth 'tens of thousands' of pounds, with some payments exceeding six figures, it said.  

The insurance company called on the GMC to 'take a clear position on this', but the regulator took no action, the report said.  

The BMJ said it had learned that the apparently widespread practice first came to light during an internal investigation launched by the insurance company in 2011.

Land Registry records showed that many independent practices were housed in expensive London properties owned by private hospital groups.

One document seen by The BMJ showed 73 properties, many in West End locations, including Harley Street and Wimpole Street, are owned by the giant American hospital corporation HCA alone. 

In 2014, The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) issued an order that prohibits inducement schemes - but The BMJ has heard evidence that some hospitals are continuing to 'buy' referrals, the report added.

One senior surgeon told The BMJ that he had been approached by a hospital group hoping to attract his referrals away from a rival as recently as nine months ago.

A spokesman for The London Clinic, London's largest independent hospital and an opponent of consultant incentive schemes, said although the rules had been 'tightened considerably' by the CMA order 'we are still seeing consultants being approached by competitors.'

The GMC's Good Medical Practice does set standards on financial arrangements and conflicts of interest. 

But The BMJ's editor in chief, Dr Fiona Godlee, said the investigation 'shows an unwillingness to act on possible breaches of these standards'.

The investigation by a health insurer uncovered 'covert schemes' aimed at consultants in private practice, encouraging them to send patients to specific private hospital groups, particularly in London

She added: 'The GMC's belief that its role is limited to offering guidance on conflicts of interests is unsatisfactory. 

'Its promise to review whether more can be done to help doctors manage potentially conflicting financial ties is vague and insufficient.'

She has called for new guidelines that stipulate UK doctors' financial interests should be included in 'a publicly available and searchable central register, updated as part of annual appraisal'.

She warned that, 'unless the GMC is serious about regulating doctors' financial conflicts of interest, insidious inducement schemes will continue to reward private hospital groups and some doctors at the expense of patients, the very people that the GMC is obliged to protect'.

GMC chief executive Niall Dickson said he understood concerns about incentive schemes. 

In a statement, he said: 'Our guidance states that doctors "must not allow any interests you have to affect the way you prescribe for, treat, refer or commission services for patients".

'We set out that doctors "must be open and honest with your patients about any such interests that could be seen to affect the way you prescribe for, advise, treat, refer or commission services for them". 

'Our guidance is comprehensive and clear in respect of the responsibilities of individual doctors and we have taken appropriate action against individual doctors in the past where there has been evidence that our guidance has been breached.

He said the GMC will be writing to all independent healthcare providers to seek assurances that they are not putting their doctors in a position where they could be acting outside GMC guidance. 

Mr Dickson said the GMC is exploring the possibility of recording doctors' commercial interests on the register.

And he added the regulator are reviewing the Competition and Markets Authority report, which highlights the potential for conflicts of interest to arise when doctors refer patients for medical treatment.  

But the insurance investigator said he found it 'staggering and totally unacceptable that the GMC, as the official regulator of the medical profession, can receive a report from a public body showing that one of the key duties of a doctor is being widely flouted and do nothing about it.'

It was, he added, 'a sad day for the medical profession when a competition regulator has had to issue an order stopping such schemes because our own regulator, the GMC, has failed to do so.'

The GMC said it did not receive a formal complaint against individual doctors and so could not investigate further.
