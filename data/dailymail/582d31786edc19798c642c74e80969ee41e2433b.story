High-end fashion brands once came with a sky-high price tag.

But now top designers are joining the ‘300 club’ – so-called because their bestselling products cost around £300.

Although far from cheap, it is a price many can afford to save up for. And aspirational shoppers keen to buy into a little piece of luxury are behind a massive increase in sales of products from Michael Kors, Fendi and Ralph Lauren.

Top designers are joining the ‘300 club’ – so-called because their bestselling products cost around £300- to meet the demand from aspirational shoppers who want to save up to buy a luxury item- they include, clockwise,  Michael by Michael Kors' red silk dress at £265, DKNY's feather skirt at £305, Mulberry's Mini Lily cross-body bag at £350, Tamara Mellon's red suede court shoes at £310 and Nicolas Kirkwood's blue metallic shoes at £305

Fashion writer Karen Kay said: ‘True luxury now costs five figures or more and fashion houses do very expensive pieces which target that market. What they are also aware of is the real cash cow that your average girl on the street in London or Manchester can afford – an entry level designer handbag. She gets a taste of the label at a price she can afford.’

Miss Kay said that the £300 mark has been settled upon because it is accessible while retaining, ‘a level of aspiration, out of the reach of the Saturday spontaneity shopper’.

And she said that society’s increasing fixation on image has caused the leading fashion houses to respond.

‘This market is catering for the mass market, which didn’t happen before,’ she said. ‘A lot of women now think nothing of spending £300 on a pair of Christian Louboutin shoes. Ten years ago that would have been absurd for anyone to spend that much other than fashion people. It’s a combination of social media and celebrity and selfie culture. I just think people are so consumed by image these days and that having that bag or those shoes is a status symbol.’

Miss Kay said handbags have replaced perfume as the key affordable item from top brands.

For example, the Dillon tote by Michael Kors’ diffusion label Michael by Michael Kors, which retails at £310, became hugely popular after being seen on the arms of celebrities such as supermodels Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, 27, and Miranda Kerr, 31, and actress Freida Pinto, 30.

However, from the same designer, the more affluent can spend £13,000 on the Crocodile Duffel. In the final half of last year, Michael Kors reported a rise in revenue of nearly 30 per cent to £840million. The Sunday Times reported figures from research company Kantar, revealing that 900,000 British women aged between 25 and 35 buy luxury brands and the market is worth around £4billion a year.

Miss Kay said some designers, such as Chanel, do not sell £300 products as they would not want to ‘dilute’ their brand. 

This was backed by Dawn Pedersen, editor of fashion website Trendzine, who said of the £300 club: ‘This is at the lower end of the luxury designer spectrum. At London Fashion Week a few days ago, the fashion crowd were carrying bags by Celine, Balenciaga and Dior – all with a £1,000-plus price tag.’
