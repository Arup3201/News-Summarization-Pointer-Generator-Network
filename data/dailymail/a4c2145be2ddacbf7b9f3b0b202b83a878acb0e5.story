A mother has accused her daughter's elementary school of fat-shaming the six-year-old girl for sending her home with a note saying she needed a health check.

Laura Cacdac was shocked when her daughter Charley, a healthy first-grader, returned home from Palm Beach Gardens Elementary in Florida with the letter after undergoing weight and height tests.

'From the results of this test, it is suggested that your child's health be examined by a physician, particularly as it relates to the problem suggested by the screening,' it read.

'A problem such as this that goes uncorrected or untreated can severely affect both the health and academic performance of your child.'

Hurt: Charley Cadac, left, was sent home with a letter last week telling her family to get her health checked after her BMI was found to be too high. Her mother, Laura Cadac, right, accused the school of fat shaming

The letter, sent by the school nurse, called for the family to take the six-year-old girl to the doctor for tests

Cacdac was stunned - and her daughter, who had read the letter, was hurt. The girl is 4ft 2 and weighs 60 pounds, her mother said.

'Her first question to me was "do they think I'm fat? Is there something wrong with me?"' Laura Cacdac told WPTV. 'It is basically in my opinion telling me I am harming my child and doing wrong by her and then telling me how to properly feed my child.' 

Charley said she was worried when she saw the letter.

'Because if I was fat, it would make me sad and kind of feel bad, like I was kind of different than everybody else,' she told WPBF.

Palm Beach Gardens Elementary screens children in line with state law.

When Cacdac called the school, the nurse said the girl's Body Mass Index was high - meaning that, according to state standards, her daughter is overweight.

'It's not a stigmatizing letter. We noted the BMI may be high or whatever, and it's a recommendation to the parents,' Palm Beach County Health Department spokesman Tim O'Connor told WPBF.  

But her mother insisted that doctors have said the girl is healthy and said she enjoys a good diet.

'My child's favorite foods are avocados, broccoli and apples,' Cacdac said. 'She is perfectly healthy in every way: emotionally, physically, and academically.'

She said she fears the impact the test will have on her daughter and believes it should have been communicated to the family better. She has now opted her daughter out of the screenings.  

'Something like this can stick with her for the rest of her life,' she said. 'It is going to stick in her head. "Am I fat? Do they think I'm fat?"'

The Palm Beach County School District said the letters are sent home with the child in sealed envelopes.
