A Toyota dealer in Western Australia has faced serious backlash on social media after it printed an advertisement which made a joke about a convicted sex offender.

'There's more hope of Rolf Harris getting a babysitting gig than us finding a better example', the ad read, underneath an image of a white Toyota HiLux utility.

The description then went on to boast features of the vehicle such as it being a 4x4 diesel engine with a steel tray with a price of $28,990.

The ad originally appeared in local paper the Kalgoorlie Miner earlier this month, but got a second wind on social media over the weekend when the image resurfaced.

This advertisement ran in the Kalgoorlie Miner, a local West Australian newspaper but resurfaced on social media at the weekend causing outrage

Earlier this month 84-year-old Harris was sentenced to five years and nine months behind bars in the UK for 12 sexual assaults.

According to social media users on Facebook and Twitter the reference to the Australian entertainer, who abused his daughter's best friend from the age of 13, was in extremely poor taste.

One person tweeted 'This is NOT ok', while another had nothing more to say than other than a simple 'Oh dear.'

According to the NT News, the offending advertisement was for Goldfields Toyota in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia.

The joke referenced Rolf Harris, who has just been jailed in the UK on 12 sex offence charges

General sales manager of the dealership Darryl 'Shack' Evans told the publication the advertisement was not intended to offend anyone and was removed off their website soon after publication.

'We try to make our ads a little bit interesting and a little bit lighthearted but we blurred the lines of good taste and bad on this occasion,' Mr Evans said.

But the advertisement took on a life of it's own despite only being printed in one edition of the newspaper, with people calling out Toyota Australia over the inappropriate reference.

Toyota Australia responded to questions on Twitter saying 'We don't endorse the ad and requested for it to be removed. Now working with dealer to ensure it doesnâ€™t happen again.'
