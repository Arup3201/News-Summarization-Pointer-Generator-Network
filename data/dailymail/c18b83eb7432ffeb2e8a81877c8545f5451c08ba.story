A fire on a packed commuter bus that killed 47 people in south-eastern China has been blamed on a suicidal man.

State media have reported that a suicide note was found at the man's home in the port city of Xiamen, where the devastating fire broke out during Friday evening's rush hour.

The suspect, who was one of those who died in the fire, has been named as Chen Shuizong.

An investigation was launched after detectives found traces of petrol on board the bus.But the petrol tank survived intact.

Chen, who is reportedly aged around 60, is thought to have set fire to the bus to vent his anger over his unhappiness with his life.

According to a government statement carried by Xinhua news agency, forensics evidence linked Mr Chen as the main suspect in the attack.

Operations of the entire express bus 
system, known as Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), were suspended after the accident, 
Xinhua News Agency said.

It quoted a survivor as saying she smelt petrol and 
then saw a fire spreading rapidly.

Photos on Chinese social media showed huge clouds of black smoke rising from the burning bus.

Victims were seen bleeding with torn clothes and burned skin. Around 30 people were injured in the fire.

An official news site, Xiamen Net, said witnesses heard sounds of explosions after the fire had been burning for about 10 minutes.

Xiamen's BRT system has been running since 2008. It covers more than 80 kilometers (50 miles) and carries more than 250,000 people each day. Xianmen Net said the buses are often crowded during rush hour.

The bus system has now been reopened following the incident.

China's public transit has been expanding rapidly over the past decade, but there are worries that the country is sacrificing safety in its rush to roll out modern services.Â 

In 2011, a high-speed train accident near the eastern city of Wenzhou killed 40 people. Later that year, a collision on a new subway line in the financial hub of Shanghai injured hundreds of people.

In 2009, an unemployed man set fire to a packed bus in Chengdu, killing himself and 26 others.
