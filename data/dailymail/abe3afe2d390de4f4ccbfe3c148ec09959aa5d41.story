Willian gave Brazil an injury scare when he hobbled out of training with a back injury on Saturday, but he says he is fit to face the Germans.

Brazil face Germany on Tuesday in Belo Horizonte without their star man Neymar and without the suspended Thiago Silva.

But the Chelsea midfielder will be available for Luis Felipe Scolari.

'I was hurt on my left side,' Willian told a press conference on Sunday.

'It bothers me a bit but it is not significant .

'I am available to play.'

Willian hopes his relationship with Chelsea team-mate Oscar, who usually plays alongside Neymar and Hulk behind main striker Fred, will be helpful if he gets the nod for the match in Belo Horizonte.

'We have played a lot of games together,' he added.

'With Chelsea I played more to the right with Oscar through the middle, but we were free to move around.

'I don't think it would be a problem because we have worked together for one year at Chelsea.'
