A Spanish court says the former president and two other former board members of football club Osasuna were arrested on Friday as part of an investigation into financial irregularities that authorities think may be linked to match fixing.

The regional court of northern Navarra says ex-president Patxi Izco, former vice president Juan Pascual and former director Diego Maquirriain were brought in to give testimony before judge Fermin Otamendi.

Another former president and two other former board members were arrested Thursday and also gave evidence before Otamendi.

Patxi Izco, ex-president of Spanish club Osasuna, appeared before a judge in connection with match fixing

Former president Juan Pascual also appeared to give a testimony in the regional court in Narvarra 

The arrests came as Otamendi investigates the disappearance of at least 2.4million euros (£1.7m) from the club's coffers between November 2013 and June 2014.

Current club director Pedro Baile Osasuna has acknowledged a government sports council audit last year uncovered an unaccounted-for payment made by the club.
