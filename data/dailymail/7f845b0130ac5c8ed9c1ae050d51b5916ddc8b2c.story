Here's the outstanding stat of the weekend for you. On his full league debut, Nabil Bentaleb, Tottenham’s 19-year-old midfielder, made 106 passes.

That’s more passes than any other player in the Premier League and he completed 93.4 per cent of them, too. 

That is phenomenal.

Pass master: Bentaleb made just six fewer passes then Barcelona's Xavi (left) did against Atletico Madrid

He made 17 more than the next best, his team-mate Mousa Dembele (89), more than double Michael Carrick (50) and was only six shy of Barcelona’s pass master Xavi (112).

People say anybody can make five-yard passes, but if they think that’s easy, they are kidding themselves. For a teenager to come in and play the way he has is unbelievable.

Tim Sherwood knows him from the youth set-up and he certainly knows a thing or two about playing in midfield.

But Bentaleb’s ability belies his age. He is confident and plays with a nice arrogance, as if he’s saying: ‘Here I am, give me the ball.’ It was a brave decision to blood the youngster, but it looks like one that will pay off.

Johnson's week to remember

Adam Johnson has had a great week. 

It started with Sunderland’s FA Cup third-round win over Carlisle when he scored a wonderful free-kick.

Then he came on as substitute against Man United last Tuesday in the Capital One Cup semi-final and won the all-important penalty.

Now he’s the proud owner of Saturday’s match ball after producing a sublime performance against Fulham and scoring a well-deserved  hat-trick.

He hugged that right-hand side, as his touch map shows (below), and he was so effective on the break.

There was talk only a few weeks ago that Sunderland wanted to offload the wide man as they were not happy with his input. Gus Poyet probably thought he wasn’t up for the fight ahead and before this week I would have had to agree.

But now it’s like having a new player. 

I have written in this column before about his talent and at times it has been wasted. 

People may start talking about an England call and that may be premature, but I really hope the penny has dropped. He has great ability and if he starts to show that on a regular basis, then the fans will be right behind him.

The SAS are back

It was a hell of a game at the Britannia on Sunday, and Liverpool were absolutely formidable in attack. They were almost more dangerous out of possession, sucking Stoke in then attacking on the break with real venom.

Then you had the return of the SAS. To see Daniel Sturridge and Luis Suarez back at it was fantastic, scoring goals and setting each other up. Taking off Philippe Coutinho and sending on Sturridge shows their depth, and if you’re a tired opposition defender, it’s a nightmare.

And what more can you say about Suarez? He’s like the Artful Dodger. He pretends to not be interested, pick-pockets the opposition and then explodes.

Everton's unsung hero

Ross Barkley, Seamus Coleman and Romelu Lukaku have been taking the headlines for Everton this season, but for me there’s absolutely no doubt who their unsung hero has been: Gareth Barry.

It started with his debut when Everton beat Chelsea 1-0 at Goodison Park back in September and he has maintained a very high standard all season. 

A lot of Everton fans would have raised their eyebrows when the signing was made, but he has been a revelation in their midfield. 

In September he played in his 500th Premier League game against Newcastle, which shows you just how long he’s been a top player and he scored his 50th PL goal with a beauty against Norwich.

He keeps things simple, but executes 
them so well and with his experience he has almost acted like a minder 
for Everton’s young stars this season.

Losing control

It was no surprise to see Swansea with 61.4 per cent possession on Saturday. What was surprising was that it came at Old Trafford. It didn’t feel like they dominated and, for all their work with the ball, they don’t create enough. But it does show United’s anxiety at home. They are not playing with any freedom. Chelsea away next week is massive for them, but of the top nine United have beaten only Arsenal. They will need to be at their best to get anything from Stamford Bridge. 

Home disadvantage?

When you’re in a relegation scrap home games are vital, but sometimes you can actually be better on the road. The bottom four played each other on Saturday, but it was the away teams —West Ham and Sunderland — who won. Home advantage helps, but there can be real tension and fear, especially if you concede. Away, there’s less pressure and you can counter-attack. That’s exactly what happened this weekend.

Pile on! West Ham celebrate a vital win away to Cardiff that helps ease their relegation worries

Leicester are on the up

It's easy to forget about Friday night games, but Leicester’s 4-1 win over Derby was the performance of the weekend. They had pace, power and have a balanced and hungry squad. With a four-point lead, they look certainties to come up. The only thing that will stop them is themselves. Last season in January they were second, but slipped to finish sixth, so it’s about whether they can cope with the pressure or if nerves will get the better of them.
