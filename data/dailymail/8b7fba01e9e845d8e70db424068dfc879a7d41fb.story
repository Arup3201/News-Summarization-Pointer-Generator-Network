A fifth motorcyclist was arrested by police on Friday in the brutal beating of SUV driver Alexian Lein earlier this month.

Kaliq Douglas, 28, of Brooklyn was charged with gang assault and assault with intent to cause serious injury for his involvement, according to police.

Douglas was hauled into the 5th Precinct station house where he was questioned Friday by investigators, according to the New York Post.

The fifth biker: Another biker, Kaliq Douglas, 28, of Brooklyn, is under arrest in connection with the road rage attack on an SUV driver on the West Side Highway

Charges: Douglas was accused of gang assault and assault with intent to cause serious injury for his involvement

First time: Douglas has not had any previous arrests in New York

He has no arrest history in New York.

The victim of the vicious motorbike gang attack was seen last week for the first time since he was brutally assaulted.

Married
 father Lien left his Wall Street apartment on Friday, October 11, in a 
hoodie, baseball cap and sunglasses. He was accompanied by a woman 
believed to be his mother or mother-in-law.

He shielded himself from cameras as he hurried down the street in downtown Manhattan and entered a high-rise building.

Hidden: Alexian Lien emerged last week from his New York home, the first time he had been seen since he was attacked by a gang of bikers

Protecting: Lien, 33, pictured last week for the first time since the incident, said he feared for the safety of his wife and two-year-old daughter who were in the Range Rover

Badly injured: Lien needed stitches after he was attacked by bikers in New York. He hit some bikers in a bid to escape them but they caught up and beat him

Terror: Lien was dragged from his car and beaten by bikers on September 29 in front of his wife and two-year-old daughter on a New York highway

The emergence of the victim came as four more bikers accused of taking part in the September 29 assault appeared in court.

Bikers
 Reginald Chance, Clint Caldwell and Craig Wright, as well as Officer 
Woljciech Braszczok, made court appearances last week on October 11.

Chance was in court on Friday morning and was the second indicted, following Robert Sims.

On Thursday, October 10, Sims who can allegedly be seen on the video dragging the driver from the SUV and beating him, was indicted.

Investigators continue to work to find out what roles other members of the gang may have played in the attack on a New York highway.

Braszczok
 also appeared on October 11 but covered his face with a hoodie on his way 
in and out of court. He is next scheduled to appear in February after he
 testifies before a grand jury.

Chance turned himself into police and was arraigned in Manhattan

Caldwell, 32, was similarly not indicted. He appeared before a grand jury this week where he alleged that Lien ignited the violence by throwing a water bottle at the cyclists during the incident on the West Side Highway.

Suspect
 James Kuehne appeared in court on October 10, as the one who allegedly 
hit Mr Lien repeatedly with his helmet. He has pleaded not guilty.

During
 the chaotic incident, Lien ran over biker Edwin Mieses in his 
SUV. The biker was left with spinal injuries and may be paralysed.

Lien
 said he feared for the safety of his wife and two-year-old daughter who
 were in the Range Rover. He has not been charged with any crime.

Claims: Clint Caldwell, 32, alleges that Alexian Lien, 33, ignited the violence by throwing a water bottle at the cyclists during the incident on the West Side Highway last month

Admission: Matthew Rodriguez, 28, above, is assigned to the Internal Affairs Bureau and only admitted being part of the ride a week ago

The developments came as another NYPD officer reportedly came forward and admitted to being part of the biker gang. 

Matthew Rodriguez, 28, is
 assigned to the Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB), and only admitted being part
 of the ride last week, according to a DNAinfo report.

It is unclear whether the five-year veteran played any part in the violence against SUV driver Lien.

Rodriguez is part of the division which is currently investigating those involved in the attack.

Detective Braszczok, 32, is charged with gang 
assault in the first-degree, assault in the first degree and criminal 
mischief in the third degree over his alleged role in the incident.

His lawyer insisted he would be exonerated by the very video prosecutors claim incriminates him during the September 29 attack.

'The
 allegation is that he struck the rear portion hatchback window, which 
has a gaping hole already in it; it's already destroyed,' attorney John 
Arlia said. 'Under the law, it's a fatal flaw. You can't break what's 
already broken.'

Mr 
Arlia said the video clearly shows Braszczok did not participate in the 
eventual attack on the SUV driver and was nowhere near him.

Braszczok
 hasn't been charged with assaulting Lien, who 
authorities say was pulled from his Range Rover and beaten on the street
 by other motorcyclists.

Pictured: A bike rider matching Braszczok's description has been identified in the YouTube video of the brutal biker gang attack that led to his arrest and charging. His lawyer has said showing pictures of his face would jeopardise his life

Hiding: Braszczok, pictured leaving court last week, has been undercover for five years, including two years with Occupy
