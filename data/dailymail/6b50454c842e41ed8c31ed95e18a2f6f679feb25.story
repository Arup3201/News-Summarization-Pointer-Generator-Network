Abuse: Former Delaware pediatrician Melvin Morse plans to testify in his trial which started yesterday. Morse is being accused of waterboarding his 11-year-old stepdaughter

A girl who claims she was waterboarded by her mother's companion, a former pediatrician, told a Delaware jury on Monday the man held her face under a running faucet several times as punishment.

Swiveling back and forth in the witness chair and smiling at times, the 12-year-old recounted how Melvin Morse, who she learned only recently was not her father, punished her in a variety of ways, including waterboarding and putting his hands over her nose and mouth.

The girl said Morse used the term waterboarding, and she was punished for spilling milk, shaking a ketchup bottle and vomiting into a cat's litter box after being made to eat too much.

'Sometimes I think I heard him yell "Die!'" she said, describing the waterboarding.

Morse pleaded not guilty to child endangerment and assault charges following his 2012 arrest for dragging his stepdaughter across the driveway by her ankles.

After being interviewed by authorities, the girl revealed that she had been waterboarded by her stepfather on four occasions and that her mother did nothing to stop the punishment.

The girl's mother, Pauline Morse, was also arrested at the time but plead guilty last May to misdemeanor charges and agreed to testify against her ex-husband. The two divorced several years prior to the abuse, but continued to live as husband and wife.

Morse was the eminent researcher on near-death experiences in children and had appeared on Oprah, Good Morning America and Larry King Live to discuss his research. He is the author of two books on near-death experiences, 'Closer to the Light' and 'Transformed by the Light'.

But his medical license was revoked after his neighbor reported him for child abuse two years ago. He worked as a pediatrician in a private practice in Milton, Delaware.

His stepdaughter, then 11, told the 
neighbor she refused to get out of the car when they returned home, so 
Morse forcibly brought her into the house by dragging her by her ankles 
across the gravel driveway and then spanked her.

In an interview following the initial driveway incident, the girl told authorities about how her stepfather would waterboard her as punishment for bad behavior.

He would hold her under faucets in the
 kitchen, bathroom and bathtub so that water would shoot up her nose, 
mimicking the sensation of drowning - a technique best-known for its use
 on suspected terrorists following the 9/11 attacks.

She said her mother Pauline did nothing to stop the torture.

Waterboarding is a form of torture in which water is poured over someone's face, simulating the sensation of drowning. A cloth is often placed over the captive's face so their breathing is restricted for up to 40 seconds as water is continually poured onto them.It dates back to the Spanish Inquisition, when it was a preferred interrogation technique as it leaves no marks on the person's body.The practice can cause extreme pain and distress, damage to lungs, brain damage from oxygen deprivation, long-lasting psychological damage and death. It can also cause broken bones as the captive attempts to escape.In 2007, it emerged that the CIA had waterboarded three Al-Qaeda suspects in 2002 and 2003. The Bush administration allowed it as a form of interrogation by narrowing the definition of torture.In 2009, President Obama banned its use, but the Department of Defense has refused to say whether it uses the technique as a form of training on its troops.

On one occasion Morse even threatened 
he 'was going to wrap her in a blanket and do it so that she could not 
move'. Another time he allegedly told her she 'could go five minutes 
without brain damage'.

The girl added that Morse would 
'sometimes look away while he did it and would become afraid that he 
would lose track of time and she would die'.

After
 the alleged torture, she would 'go outside and cry', but Morse would 
come outside and hold her nose and mouth with his hand, according to 
court documents.

'He would 
tell her she was lucky he did not use duct tape,' police noted. 'He 
would not let go until she lost feeling and collapsed to the ground.'

The girl added that she never knew what she had done to be punished and felt frightened.

Her
 then 5-year-old sister was also interviewed and said that, although 
she witnessed the abuse to her sister, she was never targeted 'because 
she is too young for it'.

At the time of the arrest, police investigated the possibility that Morse was using his stepdaughter for his research.

Both Melvin and Pauline Morse were released on $14,500 bail after their August 2012 arrest, but barred from seeing the children.

The 12-year-old girl on Monday recounted how she decided to run away the morning after the driveway incident, saying Morse had punished her that night and had warned her "there will be more."

'I was scared he was going to hurt me.... I thought he meant, like, more pain,' she said.

Prosecutors have introduced photographs of scratches and bruises on the girl, but she said Monday that several of them came from a bicycle as she pushed it along the road when she ran away from home.

Jurors were shown four homemade videos documenting Morse's encounters with the girl about her behavior.

In the first video, Morse repeatedly asked why she doesn't try to 'fix the damage' after she misbehaves.

'Why don't you try to repair things when you do something wrong, sweetheart?' he calmly asked the girl.

In another video, Morse asked the girl why she couldn't recognize that it was 'a major crime' to break the rules of the house.

'Has your therapist ever told you that you have to obey your parents?' he asked the girl, who responds affirmatively.

'It kind of gets on my nerves the way he talked to me,' she testified Monday when asked about the video.

The girl also said Morse gave her antidepressants and kept a "behavior book" in which he added or subtracted points to determine her disciplinary 'level.'

Level One included no television, no allowance and not being allowed to eat with the family. Level Two allowed her to eat with the family; Level Three allowed her to choose what kind of sandwich she wanted for lunch. The girl said she never made it to Level Four.

The girl also said Morse subjected her to other punishment, including being forced to stand with arms outstretched and her head against a wall, and being confined to her room without access to the bathroom, forcing her to wet herself or use her toy box as a toilet.

'I tried to stay out of his way so he wouldn't see me and remember something and make me do stuff,' she said.

The girl also acknowledged that she twice attempted to contact Morse after his arrest, including sending him an email in December 2012.

'Are you okay. I'm okay. I accept all apologies,' she wrote.

In a voicemail, the girl told Morse she missed him.

'I was confused and I was wondering if he was feeling the same way,' she explained. '... I just kind of wanted to say hello and I miss you.'

Pauline Morse had been allowed visitation
 when she struck a plea deal last May in which she agreed to testify 
against her husband in his trial.

At the time she was working to regain 
custody of her two daughters and her public defender Dean Johnson said 
she had 'totally changed' following her arrest.

'She has independence of thought...whereas before Melvin made the decisions and she went along,' Mr Johnson said in May.

According
 to her Facebook, Pauline Morse had worked as a researcher and the 
treasurer of her ex-husband's non-profit, The Institute for the 
Scientific Study of Consciousness, but is now a personal assistant at a 
salon.
