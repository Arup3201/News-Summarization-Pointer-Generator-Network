Jonathan Trott makes his comeback to first-class cricket on Sunday as he plays for Warwickshire in the County Championship against Nottinghamshire at Edgbaston.

Trott, 33, did not feature in Friday night’s Twenty20 defeat to Derbyshire to give himself a chance to prepare mentally for the switch back to four-day mode.

Trott has not played a first-class match for 10 weeks but advised the England and Wales Cricket Board and his county bosses that he was ready to resume his career during talks this week.

Trott has played a couple of NatWest Twenty20 Blast matches in the past fortnight. But featuring in only his second Championship match since quitting the Ashes tour last November one defeat into the 5-0 whitewash with stress-related symptoms is viewed as a significant step in his rehabilitation.

Trott began the season for Warwickshire but lasted only one Division One match — scoring 37 and 26 against Sussex — before suffering a recurrence of the problem.

The 49-cap England Test batsman spent a further six weeks away from the game before returning to second XI duty at the start of June. He has struck two hundreds since.

Warwickshire have not revealed a squad for Sunday in a bid to keep the return low key but Trott will slot in batting at No 3 with Warwickshire captain Jim Troughton unfit (back).

‘Having a world-class player coming back into the fold does nothing but help,’ said the club’s director of cricket Dougie Brown.
