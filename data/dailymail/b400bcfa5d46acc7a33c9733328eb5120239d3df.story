A couple who fell in love as teenagers but lost touch during the Second World War are finally set to marry - eight decades after they first met as children.

Bob Humphries, 89, whose wife Beryl died last year, and Bernie Bluett, 87, whose husband Roy passed away 11 years ago, spent their lives on opposite sides of the world.

Mr Humphries joined the army and Mrs Bluett enlisted in the RAF during the war - and although the soldier penned love letters to his sweetheart, they were never passed on by her protective parents.

Two years later she married an RAF pilot and moved to New Zealand, while Mr Humphries also wed. But the pair recently got back in touch - and Mrs Bluett moved to Pawlett, Somerset, to marry him.

Mr Humphries said: ‘I suppose the important thing is - the meaning of all this really - is that we met all those years ago and it must have really left some sort of impression.

‘And when circumstances brought us closer together we finally got married after all these years. It has been quite stressful but I am looking forward to it.’

The pair met when Mr Humphries’s family, who were from London, visited Mrs Bluett’s village of Appledore, North Devon, for family holidays.

She said: ‘I used to tease him mercifully. I don't know why, it was a sort of challenge I think. But then I saw him when I was 17, and he was 18, and he was this handsome soldier in khakis.

'The hormones were running wild. I thought “I'm going to marry that man one day”, but I never said a word to anyone.’

The couple dated, but when Mrs Bluett joined the airforce based in South Wales, and Mr Humphries was enlisted with the 3rd Parachute Squadron Royal Engineers in Yorkshire, they lost touch.

Mr Humphries tried to write to Mrs Bluett, but her parents disapproved of the relationship and never passed on the letters.

Bernie Bluett

Years went by and Mrs Bluett married RAF pilot Roy Bluett, who she cared for as a military nurse. The pair moved to New Zealand and had two sons and a daughter, but Mr Bluett died in 2002.

Shortly after Mr Humphries’s wife passed away last year, Mrs Bluett’s daughter discovered that he was still alive - and the couple got back in touch. She moved back to the UK soon after.

Mrs Bluett added: ‘When I saw him again I didn't see an old man - I saw that young soldier. We both feel young at heart.’

The couple, who have ten grandchildren and five great grandchildren between them, will get married at St John the Baptist Church in Pawlett on Saturday.
