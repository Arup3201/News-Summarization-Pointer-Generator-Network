Mystery still surrounds the death of the father-of-two who collapsed moments after winning a cockroach-eating competition.

It will be weeks before an autopsy reveals what exactly it was that killed Eddie Archbold, 32, from West Palm Beach, Florida, but experts have said that eating the roaches and other insects should not have been the cause.

While participating in the Midnight Madness bug-eating competition at Ben Siegel Reptiles in Deerfield Beachon on Friday night, Eddie was eating so many live roaches he had to cover his mouth to keep them from crawling out, swallowing some of them whole and still alive.

Mystery: It will be weeks before an autopsy will show what exactly it was that killed Eddie Archbold, 32, but experts have said that eating the roaches and other insects should not have been the cause

He ate more than 60 grams of meal worms, 35 three-inch-long 'super worms' and a bucket of discoid roaches, according to the Miami Herald.

Eddie - who leaves behind two daughters aged six and nine - won the competition and the grand prize of an $850 ivory ball python - which he wanted to give to his friend as a present.

But he started vomiting and collapsed in front of the store shortly after.

Dr Bill Kern, a professor of entomology
at the University of Florida, said it could have been an allergic 
reaction to the large amount of foreign protein that killed the 32-year-old.

He told the Herald: 'We know cockroaches shed a lot of 
allergens, but they’re not toxic in and of themselves.

'Very
few [human] cultures tend to eat cockroaches because they store large 
amounts of uric acid and nitrogenous waste. And they tend to be 
scavengers and feed on things most people wouldn’t consider to be 
desirable.'

Victory for short-lived for Edward Archbold who won a roach-eating contest but then mysteriously died shortly after

None of the other 30 competitors fell
ill after the contest and store manager Ben Siegel's attorney said the 
roaches were all raised in sterile conditions and were perfectly safe to
eat.

Despite this, all competitors were asked to sign waivers acknowledging the risks of gastrointestinal
illness, adverse 
allergic reactions - especially in those with shellfish allergies - and 
injury or pain associated with consuming live insects as they pass 
through the esophagus.

Matthew
Karwacki, a 26-year-old student at Florida Career College in Lauderdale
Lakes, was standing next to Eddie as they both ate the meal worms in 
the first round. But he said when he tasted his first cockroach, he was 
out.

'I just had one roach and tapped out 
after that,' he said. 'The taste did not suit me, but the texture for sure was the 
worst part.

'If you could look inside a dirty gutter and
scoop up what’s in there, that’s what went through my head. All the 
other contestants kept eating roaches, but I had to look away.'

'We feel terribly awful,' said store owner Ben Siegel, who added that Archbold did not appear to be sick before the contest.

'He looked like he just wanted to show off and was very nice,' Siegel said, adding that Archbold was 'the life of the party.'

Authorities are waiting for results of an autopsy to determine Archbold's cause of death

Archbold munched his way through an inventory of insects that were raised in a controlled environment as food for reptiles

The Ben Siegel’s Reptile Store posted a message on its Facebook page: 'All we know is that sadly he has passed on. Please respect the privacy of the family as they try to determine what happened. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Eddie’s family in this terrible time.

'Although we just met Eddie the night of the sale, we all liked him right away. All of us here at Ben Siegel Reptiles are sad that we will not get to know Eddie better, for in the short time we knew him, he was very well liked by all.'

All participants had to sign a waiver 'accepting responsibility for their participation in this unique and unorthodox contest'
