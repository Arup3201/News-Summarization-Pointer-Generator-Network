One piece of Brit Art that Charles Saatchi will probably not be adding to his famous collection is a new sculpture of the multi-millionaire himself.

The larger-than-life work depicts the man who discovered Tracey Emin and Damien Hirst standing upright with a blood-red face,  devil’s horns and an outstretched, moveable arm and grasping fingers which are clearly in Nigella strangulation mode.

The 6ft 7in mannequin is entitled ‘Playful Tiff’, a reference to how Saatchi described the infamous incident at Scott’s Restaurant, Mayfair, which ended with his accepting a police caution for assault and a quickie divorce.

Controversial: 'Playful tiff' is a sculpture by an anonymous artist in London's Jealous Gallery which shows Charles Saatchi as the devil and allows members of the public to be strangled by him

‘Playful Tiff’, a reference to how Saatchi described the infamous 
incident at Scott’s Restaurant, Mayfair - and this sign accompanies the artwork

Up until last week, the fearsome 
figure took pride of place at the appropriately-named Jealous Gallery in
the chattering classes’ enclave of Crouch End, North London — locals 
include the new Doctor Who actor Peter Capaldi.

Intrigued
art lovers were invited to interact with the installation and take a 
photograph of themselves being strangled by the flexible hand. And 
according to the gallery director, Louise Fitzjohn, many visitors did 
just that.

‘It is a 
very imposing, scary figure. It caused a huge amount of interest,” she 
says. The sculpture came with a printed notice saying: ‘Please note this
is NOT Charles Saatchi. Please feel free to take a picture of yourself 
being strangled by NOT Charles Saatchi.’

Mocked: Intrigued
art lovers were invited to interact with the installation and take a 
photograph of themselves being strangled by the flexible hand which is proving a big hit with visitors

‘Everyone who came thought it was hilarious and they all wanted to be strangled by him.

‘But actually it is a very serious, thought-provoking piece,’ Louise assures me.

Ironically
the scuplture is made from a shop dummy and the £12 million marital 
home which Nigella and Charles previously shared in Chelsea was the 
converted showroom of renowned mannequin maker Adele Rootstein.

The gallery, however, is refusing to name the artist because he or she wishes to remain anonymous.

‘It was left on our doorstep and was on show for ten days and then it was collected by courier.

‘The artist is remaining anonymous for obvious reasons. After all Charles Saatchi is the most powerful and influential art collector in the country.

‘It’s a bit like Banksy — nobody knows who he is either.’

Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has just declared an impressive £30,516 in donations to help finance the running of her private office. This includes a gift of £16,459 from ex-Labour MP Barbara Follett, wife of multi-millionaire Labour luvvie and thriller writer Ken. Cooper’s arch-rival for a possible Labour leadership battle Chuka Umunna has raised only £20,000 — all from Coral bookmaker boss Neil Goulden. So is ambitious Ms Cooper  — wife of shadow Chancellor Ed Balls — pulling ahead of Umunna in the leadership stakes? On this showing the odds certainly seem to favour her . . .

Sheherazade has gone into business with her pal, model Laura Bailey, designing gold jewellery

While millionaire MP Zac Goldsmith and his second wife Alice are cooing over Dolly, their new baby — his third child and her first — his   ex-wife Sheherazade has been busy with a production of her own.

Little has been heard of stunning Sheherazade, 39, since she divorced Zac three years ago thanks to  his adultery with  lissom Rothschild heiress Alice.

Now, I discover, she  has gone into business with her pal, model Laura Bailey, designing gold jewellery.

Clients of their new Loquet London online company can purchase  heart-shaped lockets made of crystal and 18-carat gold which, the pair explain, are ‘designed to be worn close to the heart like a talisman’.

The idea is that you then fill them with tiny meaningful charms. 

Sheherazade — the daughter of Colombian-born socialite Viviane Ventura and her ex-love, feared Seventies asset-stripper John Bentley — says she got the idea from her ten-year-old son, James, after he came home from a funfair with a  plastic heart on a necklace.

Her efforts, of course,   are somewhat more  elaborate — she  sells the baubles for between £400 and £550 each, plus you need a chain to hang them on, which can cost up to £2,000.  Sounds like an ideal christening present for Zac’s little girl.

Actress-turned-wildlife campaigner Virginia McKenna is heartbroken this week after the death of a beloved leopard on the South African savannah.

McKenna, 82 — who has saved the lives of thousands of wild animals through her Born Free charity, named after her 1966 movie about Elsa the orphaned lioness — adored Sirius, a leopard she rescued from a concrete pen in a private zoo in Monaco.

Virginia had battled for years with Prince Rainier and his son Prince Albert to let her take Sirius to her  reserve at Shamwari.

But now just four years later, the big cat has died of a liver complaint. ‘Virginia had to show all the fighting qualities we saw in her famous film Carve Her Name With Pride to free Sirius, so, of course, he meant a great deal to her,’ says a friend.

‘Virginia loved him and even took Prince Albert and his South African wife Charlene to see him.’

There’s no accounting for taste. Britain’s leading female jockey, Hayley Turner, the darling of the racing world, reveals that that she once had a penchant for eating . . . firelighters.

Currently nursing a broken ankle which has kept her out of the saddle since a fall at Yarmouth two weeks ago, Hayley has had time to update her website. She reveals: ‘As a child I ate firelighters. I used to eat everything. I was only little. I’ve got two older sisters, they probably encouraged me.’

Hayley, now 30, does not hold it against her siblings: in fact, she is currently organising middle sister Gemma’s hen night.

Hayley has also had time to think about what she will eventually do when she retires from racing.

Unlike some jockeys, she has no plans to become a trainer. Instead, she wants to help her mother re-home racehorses.

She says: ‘It’s hands-on and still working with horses and something I’d really enjoy helping her with.’

Eco-minded Prince Charles will no doubt approve of the latest efforts of fashion designer  Joey Bevan, who impressed Charles when they met two years ago with his frock made out of fruit and veg. Now, he has had another brilliant wheeze: a leather coat recycled from fly-tipped furniture. ‘I found an old sofa in a field near a reservoir,’ says Bevan, who has used car indicators in his designs. ‘I just jumped out of the car and cut the upholstery with a craft knife.’ No wonder his creations were featured in the Coronation Anniversary show at Buckingham Palace this summer.

Best known as the unrequited love interest of awkward heroine Miranda Hart  in her eponymous BBC1 sitcom, handsome actor Tom Ellis confesses he possesses a rather different admirer in real life — arch luvvie Christopher Biggins.

Asked about whether he has ever been propositioned by a celebrity, father-of-three Tom, 34, who is married to former EastEnders actress Tamzin Outhwaite, replies: ‘Christopher Biggins made it obvious he’s a big fan when we met.’

He adds: ‘I take it as a compliment, though — Christopher’s a very funny man.’
