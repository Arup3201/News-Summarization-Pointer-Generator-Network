A disgraced former magistrate has been spared jail after fraudulently claiming more than £22,000 in expenses over five years, a court heard today.

Carlton Janson, 69, made the false claims while sitting as a JP at Bolton Magistrates’ Court.

He made false claims for loss of earnings to the tune of £20,585 and exaggerated mileage claims which came to £1,419 between 2006 and 2011, Burnley Crown Court heard.

Carlton Janson thanked the judge who gave him a suspended prison sentence, and has promised to pay the money back within two months

Kirsten McAteer, prosecuting, told the court that Janson began his career as a magistrate in April 2000 but that the fraud only came to light in 2011 when questions were raised about a 'financial loss allowance' claim he had made.

Miss McAteer said checks are made on the claims of all magistrates but that 'there is a certain level of trust involved' in the system.

JPs are not paid and are allowed to claim mileage and loss of earnings, the court heard.

Janson claimed that the initial fraudulent claim was made in error but further investigations into his claims led to discrepancies being discovered as far back as 2006.

He later told police he thought he could make the claims because he was working extra hours to make the time back.

But his boss told investigators that Janson’s hours were flexible so no deductions had been made from his salary.

Miss McAteer said Janson was claiming for loss of earnings even after he semi-retired in December 2008.

Janson would also claim mileage of 19 miles for his trips to court even though his home was only two miles away.

Andrew Nuttall, defending, said Janson was a man of good character who was remorseful, ashamed and embarrassed over what he had done and that he fully intended to pay the full sum back with the help of his family, who attended the hearing.

Mr Nuttall said the offending began shortly after his only daughter died of cancer at the age of 34 in 2005.

He said Janson was a 'decent, hardworking man' who never learned how to deal with the tragedy and lost his 'moral compass'.

Mr Nuttall added: 'It cannot be a coincidence that these offences started just after he suffered a grievous loss in his family.'

Janson, of Bolton, pleaded guilty to two offences of obtaining property by deception and two counts of fraud.

Grey-haired Janson, wearing a navy 
blue suit, walked into the dock with the use of a walking stick, and 
said: 'Thank you, Your Honour' when Judge Andrew Woolman passed his 
sentence of eight months in prison, suspended for two years.

The retired buyer at Pharmatube in 
Greater Manchester has pledged to pay back the full amount within two 
months with the help of his family.

Judge Andrew Woolman told the 
defendant: 'You have brought shame and disgrace on yourself and your 
family and it will take a lot of living down.'

The judge said the shame and disgrace Janson had brought on himself was 'punishment in itself.'

He added: 'You have, of course, 
seriously let yourself, your family and the Bolton bench down. 
Magistrates are expected to behave properly and, of course, honestly.'

But the judge said that Janson’s 
actions 'did not take away' from the service he contributed to the bench
and said his poor health, which included 'mild Parkinson’s', depression
and arthritis, had been a mitigating factor.

Judge Woolman told Janson the case would be brought back to court on May 20 if he failed to pay back the money.

Janson thanked the judged and hugged his wife on his way out of court.

The disgraced JP has sat on cases which have attracted media attention.

Most notably he was chairman of the bench for the case of Jake Preston, a benefit cheat who claimed he could not walk but was secretly filmed throwing his motorbike around while racing to victory in a British motocross championship competition.

Detective Constable Neil Tate, from Greater Manchester Police’s Volume Fraud Team, said: 'For more than 10 years Janson sat as a magistrate and performed an invaluable public service.

'Unfortunately we uncovered evidence that he was also stealing from the public purse since 2006.

'The cost to the taxpayer is considerable and his actions calculated and committed over a prolonged period of time.

'He perhaps thought that because he was in the privileged position of upholding the law he could break the rules or that they did not apply to him.

'They very much did and this case shows the police, CPS and courts will take positive action against those who break the law, regardless of their standing.'
