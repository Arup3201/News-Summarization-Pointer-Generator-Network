A young man risked his life to satisfy his thrills when he climbed an 84ft-high gas holder above a city centre to take a photo of the sunrise from the top.

James Kingston, 23, sought to capture the entirety of the city in its best light, so climbed the Northam Gas Works in Southampton at 6am.

Despite 8ft of barbed wire and several warning signs, Mr Kingston braved the heights, enraging authorities further by also completing two full laps of the red metal structure.

Police and safety experts slammed Mr Kingston after he posted a picture of himself on top of the Northam Gas Works.

Mr Kingston from nearby Romsey, Hampshire said he had wanted to climb the structure for years.

He said: ‘I had always wanted to scale the building - it is an impressive landmark in Southampton and I love the way it looks.

‘I have driven past there before many times and I finally had the time to do it so I thought why not? I walked around the rim twice. It was amazing.

‘The view was incredible, it was a really nice morning and seeing the sunrise there was amazing.’

He previously caused controversy when he dangled with one hand from a 300ft crane above the Ocean Village marina in Southampton.

James, who has been a professional free runner for six years, added: ‘I don't do this to cause any trouble and I'm not looking to climb any more cranes in Southampton.

‘I just don't have a huge urge to do it again any time soon.’

Responding to criticisms that his antics encourage others to put their own lives in danger, he added: ‘I do not want people to join me, I just do it for myself.

‘Obviously this would be really dangerous if you didn't know what you were doing.

‘But I am happy that people are becoming more aware of what I do and opening their minds to it.

‘I live for adventure and putting myself in situations I have never been in.’

Hampshire police slammed James's latest actions and believe he is encouraging others to emulate his terrifying antics.

A spokesman said: ‘James has put himself at considerable risk again and continues to do so.'

‘He could have easily died if he'd fallen. People should not see these photos as inspiration to follow in James footsteps.

‘We would advise anyone to think long and hard before doing anything like this.

‘If they are not concerned for their own safety then they should think of the others, like their family or witnesses that could be affected if they were to fall.’

Southern Gas Networks, which own the gas works, said it would be launching a full investigation.

A spokesman said: ‘It appears from the footage this individual has accessed some of our low-level equipment inside the site at Britannia Road in Southampton.

‘As we take security extremely seriously we are currently carrying out a full investigation.

‘We do everything reasonable to keep our sites secure and this is an extremely rare example of a member of the public trespassing on our land.’

In response, James offered to help Southern Gas make its site more secure in future.

He added: ‘I actually found it really easy to get into this site.

‘I helped design a new anti-climb device for the crane I climbed at Ocean Village and I'll gladly help with this site's security.’
