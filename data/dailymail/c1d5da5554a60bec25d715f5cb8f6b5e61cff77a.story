Nasa has narrowed down the hunt for an asteroid that it can capture and put it into orbit around the moon.

The space agency said it has found three suitable asteroids, one of which it hopes it can put into lunar orbit using a robotic space lasso.

Once in orbit, astronauts will be able to visit the space rock using the Orion spacecraft by as early as 2021.

The asteroids are all between seven and 10m in size, but further tests will need to be conducted to determine their suitability, said scientists at a conference in San Diego, California.

‘We have two to three which we will characterise in the next year and if all goes well... those will be valid candidates that could be certified targets,’ said Paul Chodas, senior scientist at the Nasa Near-Earth Object Program Office.

The mission hopes to gather useful information that will help protect the Earth from a potential hazardous asteroid collision, as well as the technology to enable for future human missions to deep space.

NASA would find an asteroid which is between seven and 10m wide.

They would then tow or push it towards Earth so that it ends up in a stable orbit near the moon.

In
2021 astronauts would then use an Orion capsule - a manned spacecraft -
to land on the asteroid and bring back soil and rock samples for 
analysis.

This asteroid would also, probably in the 2030s, be used as a stop-off point for astronauts on their way to Mars.

Last month, the latest version of the plan was revealed in an animation.

Exact details on how Nasa plans to pluck an asteroid out of its trajectory are not yet known, but the rendering shows it is captured and held inside what looks like a giant plastic bag.

The mission involves astronauts making the journey to their captive space rock by hitching a ride on the next-generation Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle.

Though it bares a striking resemblance to the earlier Apollo Spacecraft, Orion can hold more crew and is far-more advanced, said Nasa.

Up to four people can be shuttled to the asteroid, compared to the maximum three in Apollo, in a trip that utilises both solar power and the Moon’s gravitational pull to power the spacecraft, according to the video.

After the Orion and the asteroid are attached, the astronauts take a spacewalk to the captured object

Once the Orion docks with the remote-operated asteroid capture device, the crew performs a spacewalk that sees them climb almost the length of the conjoined vehicles to an exposed section of the asteroid they take photos of and scoop samples from, the video shows.

After the mission is complete, Orion returns to Earth on the same path it journeyed out on, loop around the moon included, and splashes down in an ocean – likely the Pacific – 10 days later, as seen in the video.

The project, which envisions that astronauts could visit such an asteroid as early as 2021, is included in President Obama's £11.5 billion spending plan for the U.S. space agency for the 2014 tax year.

It is intended as an expansion of existing initiatives to find asteroids that may be on a collision course with Earth, and as part of preparations for a human expedition to Mars in the 2030s.

‘This mission allows us to better develop our technology and systems to explore farther than we've ever been before - to an asteroid and to Mars - places that humanity has dreamed about … but has had no hope of ever attaining,’ Nasa administrator Charles Bolden said.

Using a combination of solar power and gravity-aided thrust, the Orion will make the 10 day trip to the asteroid

‘We're on the threshold of being able to tell my kids and my grandkids that we're almost there.’

Interest in potentially threatening asteroids sky-rocketed after a small asteroid exploded over Chelyabinsk, Russia on February 15, shattering windows and damaging buildings.

About 1,500 people were injured by flying glass and debris.

The same day another larger asteroid passed about 17,200 miles from Earth - closer than the television and communication satellites that ring the planet.

The incidents had created an imperative ‘to develop techniques and technology that will help deter or to keep an asteroid or other type of body from impacting Earth,’ Mr Bolden said.

‘One of the serendipitous results from this [asteroid-retrieval] flight we hope will be the demonstration of a capability to move an asteroid, to deflect it ever so slightly.’

Mr Obama is also requesting £535 million to support efforts to develop commercial space taxis in hopes of breaking Russia's monopoly on crew transportation to the space station by 2017.
