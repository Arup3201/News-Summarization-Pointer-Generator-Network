The Queen has telephoned Australia's leading horse trainer Gai Waterhouse about her horse which races in Sydney tomorrow, with high hopes of a win for the royal stallion, Carlton House.

Waterhouse, known as the 'queen of racing' in Australia, told Her Royal Highness Carlton House has been performing well in trackwork and was in great form for his race at Sydney's Royal Randwick on Saturday.

Waterhouse's stable reported the Queen's horse had just 'shaded' or beaten the champion trainer's prize stallion, Fiorente, in an exhibition gallop at Randwick in late January.

Victory at last: after a two decade career as a horse trainer, which has been marked by sensational success and controversy, Gai Waterhouse, now the Queen's trainer, finally won Australian horse racing's most glittering prize last year, the Melbourne Cup

Fiorente won the Â£3.3m Melbourne Cup last November, giving Waterhouse her first victory in Australia's richest horse race.

Waterhouse said the Queen - who has had a lifelong passion for horse racing - appeared extremely knowledgeable about Australian racing during their lengthy telephone conversation.

'She is well read, highly intelligent and knows her horses,' Waterhouse told The Daily Telegraph, explaining she addressed the Queen as 'Her Majesty or Ma'am'.

'Her Majesty knows what is happening down under and is very much on the ball.'

Folllowing Carlton House's disappointing form at Royal Ascot, in late 2012 the Queen transferred the colt from leading British trainer Sir Michael Stoute to Waterhouse, who had previously trained horses for the Queen Mother, .

Carlton House, named after a former royal residence at Pall Mall, came out of quarantine into the Waterhouse stable in January 2013 and has raced twice, unplaced, while he acclimatised to Australian conditions.

At trackwork (above) in the Sydney stables of controversial but sensationally successful trainer Gai Waterhouse, the Queen's horse has behaved like 'a gentleman' and his gallops have been so 'outstanding' the stallion beat Waterhouse's recent Melbourne Cup winner, Fiorente, at an exhibition gallop at Royal Randwick, where he races tomorrow

Waterhouse is known in Australia for her sensational success on the track, but also for a recent controversy surrounding her bookmaker son and for the nation's greatest racing scandal, involving her husband, also a 'bookie'.

Waterhouse told the Queen she was excited about the sparkling form she has managed to get out of the monarch's stallion.

Carlton House has drawn barrier three and is currently fourth-placed favourite in Saturday's Expressway Stakes, which will be screened live on British television at 5.12am local time.

Jockey Tommy Berry will wear the Queen's racing silks which have a purple body with gold braid, maroon scarlet sleeves and black velvet cap with gold fringe.

Waterhouse said the Queen told her she won't watch the race live as it would be so early in the morning in Britain. However, she did intend to record it and watch footage later. 

The trainer said she and the Queen discussed the fact Carlton House's race this weekend was a 1200 metre sprint.

'I explained to Her Majesty this is what the horse has been working over and he is ready to handle it,' Waterhouse said.

The Queen's horse trainer, Gai Waterhouse (left, at rear), had her own annus horribilus in 2013 when she ended up in a race stewards' inquiry after multimillionaire Australian entrepreneur John Singleton (right) accused her of misleading him over one of his horses and sacked her as trainer

'The Queen was very interested to learn how Carlton House is doing here and I told her I'm over the moon with the horse.

'He is thriving, he is such a gentleman to train.He is all about trying to please you and his work has been first class.'

The Queen's racing manager, Johnny Warren, was in Australia last month watching over Carlton House's race preparations.

It was Warren who made initial contact with Waterhouse, to see whether she could take Carlton House into her stable.

'I trained for the Queen Mother. She had two horses with me, Life is Beautiful and Clarence House.' she said.

At the time, Warren said the Queen was 'very enthusiastic about the prospect' of having the horse run in Australia 'where racing is top class' and where Waterhouse was known as a leader in her field.

Scottish-born Waterhouse, a former actress and model who once appeared Dr Who is the daughter of TJ Smith, a top racehorse trainer in Australia from the 1950s to the 1980s.

She is married to Robbie Waterhouse, scion of a famous Australian racing dynasty of bookmakers whose multi-million dollar business has been the subject of rumour and innuendo over decades.

Allegations of illegal off-course betting and horse doping against family patriarch Bill Waterhouse went unproved.

But in 1984, the Australian Jockey Club (AJC) revoked the bookmaking licenses of both father and son over their alleged 'prior knowledge' of a horse substitution ring-in, known as the Fine Cotton affair.

It was never alleged Bill or Robbie Waterhouse were involved in the scam, in which a horse called Bold Personality was daubed with hair dye and white paint to resemble Fine Cotton, a lowly performing gelding, which it substituted in a race in Brisbane, Queensland, and won.Robbie Waterhouse was warned off racecourses for 17 years, before his reinstatement in 2002, and the incident stymied Gai Waterhouse's attempts to gain a trainer's licence, which the AJC finally granted in 1992.

Winning the Melbourne Cup, as Gai Waterhouse did last year with jockey Damien Oliver on Fiorente (pictured) last year is akin to winning the lottery in Australia and was a last minute sweetener for Waterhouse and her family who endured a year of controversy in 2013

Her hugely successful career since was marred by controversy last year involved Robbie and Gai's son, Tom Waterhouse, who with his grandfather and mentor became Australiaâ€™s largest on-course bookmakers in 2007.

Tom and Gai became embroiled in public acrimony after it was alleged he had told told friends More Joyous, a horse belonging to a multimillionaire Australian entrepreneur, would lose its race on last year's Sydney Cup day, which it did.

The horse's owner, John Singleton, sacked Gai Waterhouse as his trainer and stewards found Gai Waterhouse guilty of two race charges and fined her Â£3000.

The incident has entered Australian racing legend as the 'More Joyous affair'.
