Morgan Schneiderlin has heaped praise on his former manager Mauricio Pochettino in the strongest suggestion so far that he is set to join Tottenham.

The France midfielder, who worked under Pochettino at Southampton, said that Spurs have a great future with the Argentine manager in charge.

Schneiderlin also expressed his dismay that Southampton had lost Pochettino, in a clear indication that he is ready to join the exodus from St Mary's.

'I think a manager like that is good for every club,' said Schneiderlin. 'With the quality Tottenham have, Mauricio Pochettino will get the best out of each player.

'He came in and made Southampton play and now Tottenham have a great future.

Schdierlin, a long-term target of Spurs' rivals Arsenal, also said that he owed his recent 
development, which earned him a spot in France's World Cup squad, to 
Pochettino.

'He improved me very much. He improved the whole squad and improved me as a player.

'He’s a great coach and good man and it’s a shame Southampton lost him.'

Arsene Wenger is a confirmed admirer of the 24-year-old France international and Arsenal have opened discussions over a proposed move to bring him to The Emirates - but Schneiderlin is keen to move to the other half of North London.

Schneiderlin joined Southampton from Strasbourg for just £1.2million in 2008 and has since made over 200 appearances, earning plaudits for his work-rate, high tackle count and interceptions.

He is contracted until 2017 but is ready to leave Southampton once a fee is agreed.
