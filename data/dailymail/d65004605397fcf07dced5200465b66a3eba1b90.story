When a nine-year-old boy built an arcade from cardboard boxes in his father's Los Angeles auto parts store, he'd hoped for customers to come and share in the fun.

But Caine Monroy was stunned when a flash mob of hundreds turned up to play - after a filmmaker who had been blown away by the intricacies of the boy's games encouraged people on Facebook.

And now there is even more good news for the creative youngster, after an impressed arcade owner has offered him real arcade games worth thousands of dollars.

Entrepreneur: Caine Monroy built a cardboard arcade in his father's auto parts store and hundreds of people flocked to see it. Now he has been offered a real arcade game worth thousands

When a video of the home-made arcade went viral, it was seen by the owner of an L.A. pinball shop, who then invited Caine to her store and meet professional pinballers, TMZ reported.

Caine visited Pins and Needles - a pinball and tailoring shop - on Wednesday evening and played on a real pinball machine for the first time in his life, the website added.

The store's owner, Molly Atkinson, was reportedly so impressed with the boy that she offered him one of several pinball machines, which cost as much as $3,000, for free.

TMZ added that he has not yet decided which game to take home.

The generous gift comes after Caine 
spent his summer vacation collecting empty boxes used for shipping and 
creating an elaborate arcade, complete with prize displays, gifts bags, 
and a security system involving calculators.

The
arcade grew to take up his father's whole store and included handmade 
soccer games, a claw machine he devised himself and built in hand-fed 
ticket dispensers.

‘Caine does not pass by an arcade 
without stopping in, he loves tickets, playing games, he loves prizes so
it was only natural for him to build his own arcade,’ his father 
George said.

‘He loves to 
see how things are built, he takes all his toys apart to see how they 
work, he can’t put them back together but he takes them apart.’

But the schoolboy’s chances of 
attracting customers to his intricate arcade were very slim, as his 
father’s store is in an industrial part of the city and has very little 
foot foot traffic.

That’s until filmmaker Nirwan Mullick walked in and wanted to have a go.

‘I
asked Caine how it worked and he told me that for $1 I could get two 
turns, or for $2 I could get a Fun Pass with 500 turns. I got the Fun 
Pass,’ Mullick wrote on his website.

The
animator began playing with Caine's handmade games and was shocked by 
the intricacies of each one and how similar they were to traditional 
arcade games.

Obsessed: Caine's father, George, says his nine-year-old son can't even walk past an arcade without going in

‘I’m playing miniature soccer, 
miniature basketball, and then when you score a point, [Caine] would 
crawl into the box and he pulls out these little tickets out of the side
of the cardboard,' he said.

‘I was like this kid’s is a genius...I was blown away.’

Mullick was so impressed that he asked Caine's father if he could film a short movie about his son's arcade.

George
agreed, which led Mullick to hatch a plan to help make Caine's biggest 
dream come true and turn Caine's Arcade into a fully-functioning store 
with customers.

Packed: Mullick's flashmob helped Caine attract a lot of customers and made for an inspiring movie

Mullick organised a Facebook flashmob to surprise the boy but even he had no idea how big the even would become. 'It went viral,' he said.

At the end of the day Caine 
asked, 'Is this real life or am I just dreaming?' and turned to his 
father and said: 'Dad, this was the best day of my whole life.'

Mullick's
film about Caine has already been viewed almost 20,000 times on YouTube
and 'Caine's Arcade' was trending on Twitter today.

The
filmmaker also started a scholarship fund for Caine so he could one day
attend college. The initial target was $25,000 but it has already 
reached $26,000, making Mullick increase it to $100,000.
