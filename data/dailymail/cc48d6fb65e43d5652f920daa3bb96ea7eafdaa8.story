If there's one thing most Americans can agree on, it's that the modern family is falling apart.

The majority of Americans believe families today are weaker compared to when they were kids,  according to a new poll conducted by CBS.

Sixty-four per cent said the American family is weaker today than it was when they were children, while just 13 per cent said it was stronger. Nineteen per cent didn't notice much difference at all.

While the majority of every age group agreed that the American family is less stable today, it was the Baby Boomer generation that was most certain about the change.

More Americans aged 55-64 believe that the American family is weaker now than when they were growing up in the post-war period.

Just 7 per cent of the Baby Boomers said the American family was getting stronger.
