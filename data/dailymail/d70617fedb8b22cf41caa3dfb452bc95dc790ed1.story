The website also reports that the 24-year-old has been ordered to stay 100 yards away from the alleged victim.

While it is not yet clear why Brown’s charge was reduced, TMZ reports it may be because the injuries were minor.

The victim apparently claims Brown broke his nose but according to the publication, the police have stated that the man was treated for a fractured nasal bone.

The original police report allegedly stated that it was Brown’s bodyguard who threw the punch, but the bodyguard's charge has also been reduced to a misdemeanour.

It's not over yet: Brown has been released without bail but has been ordered to stay 100 yards away from the alleged victim

The R&B singer along with 
Christopher Hollosy allegedly punched a man outside the upscale W Hotel 
in Washington at 4:25 a.m. Sunday, law enforcement sources have said.

However there have been conflicting witness accounts and Brown has apparently denied punching the alleged victim, claiming the man tried to board his tour bus and his bodyguard 'handled it'.

Brown, who will appear in court again on November 25, has also been accused of making a homophobic slur during the altercation that led to his arrest.

The alleged victim, Isaac Adams Parker, 20, of Beltsville, Maryland, told police the Brown commented: 'I’m not down with that gay s**t,' when he attempted to get into a picture that the singer was taking with a female fan.

Conflicting accounts: Chris pleaded not guilty. It is unclear whether it was him or his bodyguard who threw a punch at the alleged victim, which the victim claimed broke his nose

Minor injuries?: It has been claimed that Brown and his bodyguard's charges may have been reduced because the victim was allegedly treated for a fractured nasal bone rather than a broken nose

Parker claims he replied: 'Why you hoing?' and Brown answered: 'I feel like boxing.'

Parker alleges he was punched by 
Brown and then his bodyguard, and that the singer then went and stood 
behind the bodyguard and told Parker to 'walk away'.

TMZ further reports that the Los 
Angeles County Probation Department are now launching an investigation 
to determine whether the charges violate the terms of the probation he 
is currently on.

The website claims the Probation 
Department was informed of the arrest by Brown's lawyer Mark Geragos, 
and he allegedly could face up to four years in prison if it is decided 
that his probation should be revoked.

His probation was briefly revoked in 
July after he was involved in a hit-and-run incident in Los Angeles, but
it was later reinstated in August.

The star was charged on May 21 with a
misdemeanour hit-and-run and driving without a valid licence following 
the accident in the San Fernando Valley.

Though he refuted claims by the other
driver involved, insisting he 'followed the proper procedures' and 
exchanged information with the owner despite there being no damage to 
his car.

After being 
arrested for assaulting then-girlfriend Rihanna in February 2009, the 
Turn Up The Music singer pleaded guilty to a felony and accepted a plea 
deal.

On August 25 he 
was sentenced to five years' probation, one year of domestic violence 
counselling and six months' community service, while his five-year 
restraining order remained.
