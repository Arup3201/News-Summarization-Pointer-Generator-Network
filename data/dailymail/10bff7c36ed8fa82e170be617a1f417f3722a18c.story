A restaurant run by Michelin-starred chef Raymond Blanc has been banned from serving an undercooked liver dish which left two diners with potentially lethal food poisoning

A restaurant run by Michelin-starred chef Raymond Blanc has been banned from serving an undercooked liver dish which left two diners with potentially lethal food poisoning.

Blanc Brasserie in London's Covent Garden has been forbidden from offering pink lamb's liver after ignoring a warning from Westminster Council environmental health officers.

The food presented an 'imminent risk of injury to health' because of the way it was cooked, Westminster Magistrates' Court was told today.

French-born Mr Blanc, 62, is a director of the company that owns the restaurant.

James Armitage, Westminster City Council's food, health and safety manager, said: 'After receiving two separate complaints of food poisoning which may have originated from eating at a Covent Garden restaurant, our officers investigated and issued a notice which prevented the restaurant from serving undercooked lambs' liver.

'Today's court decision to uphold the notice is welcome as the serving of undercooked meat, without suitable controls in place, is a public health risk.

'Health inspectors have agreed with the restaurant the safety measures that need to be in place for the restaurant to be allowed to safely put the dish back on its menu.'

The two diners contracted campylobacter food poisoning after they had the dish on separate occasions this summer.

Guidance from the Food Standards Agency (FSA) recommends that lamb's liver must be cooked at 70 degrees centigrade for at least two minutes.

But the Brasserie Bar Co. said it had taken liver off the menu at all 18 of its Blanc Brasserie restaurants throughout Britain after it was ordered to pay Â£3,103 in costs.

A spokeswoman said: 'Brasserie Bar Co. has not contested the environmental health officers' enforcement and will no longer serve liver in any of its restaurants.

'In order to serve liver and comply with Westminster Council, it would need to be overcooked to such an extent that our customers just won't eat it.'

Mr Blanc's Le Manoir aux Quat'Saisons restaurant in Great Milton, Oxfordshire, was awarded two Michelin stars in 1985.

There were more than 371,000 estimated cases of campylobacter food poisoning in England and Wales in 2009, resulting in more than 17,500 hospitalisations and 88 deaths, according to the FSA.
