A portrait of King Louis XIV, the Sun King

During the 72-year reign of Louis XIV - the longest of any major European monarch - French became the universal language of the European elite.

So it is not exactly surprising that French critics have reacted angrily to the news he is to become the protagonist in a new 'dumbed down' television show - produced in English.

Critics have labelled it a 'crime' to have the great monarch speak in English - particularly as the ten-part series is being made by French station Canal Plus.

The show, called Versailles, has also been written by Brits - Dame Helen Mirren's nephew Simon Mirren and Spooks creator David Wolstencroft - and stars British actors.

George Blagden, best known for his role as Grantaire in the 2012 film adaptation of Les Miserables, will play the role of the Sun King.

It may be small comfort to critics that Blagden is at least fluent in French, as is Amira Casar, another British-born actor who will play a courtesan called Beatrice.

Seeing 24-year-old Blagden speak in English could be a strange experience for French viewers, as he fought William of Orange's English disciples during the Glorious Revolution.

The series will cost a huge £21million - which works out as twice as much per episode as Downton Abbey.

It will follow a young Louis XIV from 1660, 17 years into his reign when he is 22, on his journey to become the most powerful monarch in Europe, from his battles with the fronde through his development into the Sun King. 

A synopsis for the show on spoilertv reads: 'Born strategist, mischievous manipulator, Louis will use every resource at his disposal to keep the Noblesse on a short leach, while feeling bitter resentment in his private life, even paranoia. The man is also capable of romantic passion. But how to live them when you're the greatest king in the world?

'The first season will see the young King evolve to become the Sun King, the King of the Kings. Characters both real or fictional, from courtesans to humble paysans, will guide us through a world of betrayals and secrecy, political manoeuvres and war declarations, revealing Versailles in all of its glory and brutality. A golden cage where arrivists, ready to do anything to get in, will never be able to get out.'

Leonardo Di Caprio played Louis XIV in the 1998 film The Man in the Iron Mask, but Versailles is being produced by a French station, Canal Plus

Canal Plus will premiere the show next year, and it will not be the first time they have produced television in English - it was also behind Borgia.

Nor is it the first time Louis XIV will have spoken English on screen. He was played by Leonardo Di Caprio in 1998 film The Man in the Iron Mask.

But the fact that this series has been produced by a French station and is being broadcast in France  makes it a little harder for critics to stomach.

'It is very worrying and totally implausible that a series about Louis XIV should be made in English,' Gaston Pellet of the United Republican Group for Linguistic Renaissance, Initiative and Emancipation told The Times.

'We have nothing against English, but we don't want French to become a second language in France.'

The decision to produce in English has been made because it will make the show easier to sell outside of France.

Director of fiction at Canal Plus, Fabrice de la Patelliere, called it a 'pragmatic choice to enable the series to be exported'. 

In France itself, viewers will be able to choose to watch the show with subtitles or dubbed in French.
