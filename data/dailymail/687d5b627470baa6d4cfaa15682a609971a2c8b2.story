Hull assistant manager Steve Agnew has left the club to rejoin Middlesbrough.

Agnew left Boro to join Steve Bruce's backroom team in June 2012 and was seen as a key part of the club's return to the Barclays Premier League.

But he still lives in the Yarm area and has been tempted back to his former club for a third stint, this time as Aitor Karanka's right-hand man.

First-team coach Keith Bertschin is expected to take a more active match-day role, while academy coach Stephen Clemence is also on hand.

Agnew, 49, previously held the title of reserve team coach at the Riverside and stood in as caretaker manager when Gordon Strachan departed in October 2010.

Hull tweeted: 'Assistant Manager Steve Agnew has left the club to join Championship side Middlesbrough. We wish Steve well for the future.'Â
