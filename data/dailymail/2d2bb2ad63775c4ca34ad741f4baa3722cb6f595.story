To his legions of admirers on this side of the pond, there is no need to fret. Frank Lampard will stay for as long as he is wanted.

Diplomatically the plan is to wait until Manchester City’s chief executive (Feran Soriano) has sat down with New York City’s chief executive (Feran Soriano) to reach the inevitable conclusion.

They can get around the PR easily enough because Lampard, at the age of 36, is still a top quality asset in the Barclays Premier League. Fact.

Here at St Mary’s there was another touch of the old magic when he lifted himself off the bench to score Manchester City’s second goal against Southampton. It was textbook Lampard.

This was a rasping strike from the edge of the area, the type he used to despatch so regularly when he was wearing the colours of Chelsea.

Suddenly those days when he was chasing down the great Bobby Tambling’s goalscoring record, which he eventually overhauled, feels like a lifetime ago.

There is no doubt, after four months as a City player, Lampard is a blue through and through.

‘I don’t think anyone can find it strange the way Frank Lampard plays football,’ claimed City’s manager Manuel Pellegrini.

‘He knows how to play the game. At the age of 36 he cannot play three games in a week, not 90 minutes every game, but he played 90 minutes against Bayern Munich so it wasn’t good for him to start again.

‘He always makes the difference because he is a top player.’

Stateside they will will wonder when they will ever see Lampard wearing the New York City shirt because when life is this good, you don’t want to walk away from something like this.

In a couple of weeks’ time, provided City overcome the final hurdle in their Champions League group game with Roma, they will be in the draw for second round.

Anyone who has ever come into contact with Lampard, who is technically on loan from his American team, will know of the midfielder’s love for European football’s elite competition.

He has played in seven Champions League semi-finals, going on to win it with Chelsea in 2012 and you simply wouldn’t bet against him going deep in to this competition with City.

To walk away from that, plus the realistic possibility of slugging it out with Chelsea for the Barclays Premier League title, is not in Lampard’s make-up. The guy is a winner.

It is unthinkable for him to leave mid-way through a campaign, particularly when Lampard calls all the shots. It’s his decision.

The alternative is to join in with pre-season training with the other six players who have so far been signed by New York City in preparation for their MLS bow in March. You do the math.

Lampard’s numbers are already stacking up at City. This was his fifth goal since his surprise move to the Etihad following his release by Jose Mourinho last season.

Lampard and Steven Gerrard know they will have to play the rotation game if they are to prolong their careers

‘Players have longer careers than some years ago,’ added Pellegrini. ‘I had Robert Pires (at Villarreal) in his last years as well and he was very good.

‘The top players know how to do it. They know best every time they have the ball.’

Timing, as the 256 goals he has scored in his professional career with West Ham, Swansea, Chelsea and Manchester City, is everything.

He has also proved, that managed correctly, it is possible to stretch a career at the very highest level into the mid-thirties.

This is a problem for Brendan Rodgers at Liverpool as he works out a way to get the best from the captain Steven Gerrard at the age of 34. Rotation and rest is the answer.

Lampard accepts that his days as a nailed on starter are over and yet he continues to make an impact whenever he plays.

It is only a matter of time before City’s supporters strike up the tune: ‘Frank Lampard we want you to stay’ for a man they voted the club’s player of the month in September.

You just know, judging by the smile on Lampard’s face when he arrowed his effort beyond the reach of Southampton keeper Fraser Forster, how much he loves this sport. There should be more built like him.

He enjoys working with Pellegrini and is known to be quite taken with the management methods of City’s coach. Lampard has responded to his relaxed, yet thorough, style.

‘Frank is not only a top player but a great profession and person,’ added Pellegrini. ‘He’s very happy here and he also enjoys the way we play.

‘He makes a difference in the last 25-30 minutes and we’re very happy with him.’

After this, they just need to work out a way to break the bad news to his USA Fan Club.
