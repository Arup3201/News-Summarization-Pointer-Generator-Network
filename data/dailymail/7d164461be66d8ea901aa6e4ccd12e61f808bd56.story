While Liverpool players are determined to give Steven Gerrard a perfect send off to his Anfield career by winning the FA Cup, there is a growing confidence within the camp there will be life after the iconic captain.

Liverpool have won all six of the games that Gerrard has missed with a hamstring injury and the 3-4-3 formation used by Brendan Rodgers has made them look more like the vibrant side that chased Manchester City for the Premier League title last season. 

They have gone from mid-table to genuine Champions League hopefuls as a result.

Gerrard is in contention to return for Sunday's FA Cup quarter-final against Blackburn Rovers but may find it hard to force his way back into the starting line-up. This season's FA Cup final takes place on his 35th birthday and would be his final match for the club before he joins LA Galaxy.

'It's always sad when someone is injured, you don't wish that on anybody. But I think it is good that we have proved we can succeed without Steven,' said Alberto Moreno, a £12million summer signing from Sevilla and a key member of the new-look side Rodgers is trying to assemble.

'We've moved up the table and been winning matches. It shows that within this squad there are some top, top players to replace even the likes of Steven Gerrard,' said Moreno, a left-back who has been pushed further forward into midfield in recent weeks.

'Whoever is injured, the player who comes into replace them puts themself on the line for the Liverpool cause. The morale and dynamic of the group has been very good. We're playing well and we've proved we can carry on without him.

'I think the new system we are playing has helped us intensify our play even more. It allows us to get lots of bodies forward when we are attacking, but we are safe in the knowledge of having three centre-backs covering as well as the two deep-lying midfielders.

'If we need to lend a hand as well, the wing-backs you can call them, we can drop back and support as well as get forward and support the attack.

'You have to point to the fact we have picked up a lot of victories and points since the system changed, and I guess it does allow us to be a little bit more intense. But it wasn't as if we weren't trying to play with intensity before, we were just inconsistent and dropped points we shouldn't have done.'

Of course, Moreno is not dismissing the contribution of Gerrard to Liverpool over the years, and is using the captain's impending departure as an extra incentive to lift a trophy.

Fresh from Sevilla, where he won the Europa League last season, the energetic 22-year-old is almost in awe of Gerrard.

'It will stick in my memory that I've had a chance to play and train with one of the best players in the world,' he says.

'The Spanish have a word 'crack' to describe a big star, 'Supercrack' means megastar and that is Steven. I have watched him play since I was a boy and now I've had the fortune to not just share a dressing room with him, but to train and play alongside him. He was one of my idols growing up.

'To win the FA Cup would be the perfect present for him, wouldn't it? To be able to leave the club with a trophy under his belt, that would be fantastic for Steven. But not just for him, it would be a great thing for the team and for the fans as well.'
