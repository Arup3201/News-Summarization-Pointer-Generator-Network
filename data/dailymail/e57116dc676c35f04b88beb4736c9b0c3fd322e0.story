Spare pair of knickers: tick. Extra pair of tights: tick. Checking the location of public loos along the route I'll be taking today: tick.

No, this isn't my plan for when I take my toddler out. It's what I have to do every time I leave the house. Because I'm one of those women you'll see crossing their legs when they're about to cough or sneeze, or who regretfully decline the opportunity to jump on a trampoline with their children.

Sound familiar? I expect so - because some estimates say as many as one in three women have ongoing problems with their pelvic floor muscles and incontinence after their first baby. The more babies they have, the more interventions during labour (such as forceps), the bigger any subsequent babies, or the older the mother, the more likely they are to have this problem.

And yet, despite this being incredibly common, many of these women suffer in silence or, if they do seek help, struggle to get the treatment they need.

I'm a typical example. At 48, I've had four children, now aged 20, 18, 16 and 12, and for years I have shamefully kept my secret - that any sudden pressure on my bladder can cause varying degrees of what is euphemistically described as 'leakage'.

This condition, known as stress urinary incontinence (SUI), is not to be confused with urge incontinence, or overactive bladder. This is where people have a sudden desire to pass urine and may leak before reaching the loo - thought to be because the bladder gives the wrong messages to the brain.

SUI occurs when the pressure in the bladder wall becomes too great for the urethra (the tube through which urine passes) to withstand. It is usually caused by weak pelvic floor muscles, which wrap around the underside of the bladder and rectum, supporting these structures.

Some really unlucky souls have both stress and urge incontinence - known as 'mixed incontinence'.

Over the past 15 years, I have developed my own strategies for hiding my problem. I know I'll leak if stress is suddenly put on my bladder. So I don't lift heavy bags; I wear pads when exercising; I stand still when I'm about to sneeze.

And I never, ever, dance along to Jeff Beck's Hi Ho Silver Lining. This is a lesson learnt from when I wet myself at a wedding - one high kick caused my bladder to give way, and I spent a miserable half-hour in the ladies', stuffing my knickers with tissue to try to dry out. I don't think anyone noticed, but my humiliation makes me blush to this day.

Although much can be done to improve the lives of women with such conditions, specialists say that whether or not a woman gets the right help will largely be down to the initial response of her GP.

When I finally plucked up the courage to visit a female GP a year ago, I was met with a nonchalant shrug and a, 'What do you expect? You've had four babies'. I was handed a photocopied sheet of pelvic floor exercises and advised to lose some weight - excess weight on the pelvic floor adds to its load and leads to sagging.

When I recount this story to Alison Bourne, a women's health physiotherapist at the Chesterfield Royal Hospital, Derbyshire, there is a palpable intake of breath. 'Women who go to their GPs reporting stress incontinence should be referred to units that can provide the specialist pelvic floor training that can vastly improve their lives,' she says.

I made a half-hearted attempt to lose weight and do the exercises - which basically involve eight to ten squeezes of the pelvic floor muscles three times a day - but lost interest when I read it would take at least 12 weeks to see a difference.

It was only months later, when I heard Katie Mann, a women's health physiotherapist, on BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, advising women like me not to take no for an answer, that I returned to my GP.

Now, it was my turn to produce a photocopied sheet - information from the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, which stressed it should never be considered normal to spend the rest of your life wetting yourself. 'We believe nearly 70 per cent of women report a degree of urinary incontinence during pregnancy,' says Ms Mann, who works in the North-West and specialises in helping women for whom dealing with incontinence has become a way of life.

And, after pregnancy, 38 per cent of women experience ongoing problems, according to a survey by Netmums for the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy and the Royal College of Midwives.

A staggering 75 per cent of those with problems had never sought help for this treatable condition. Indeed, half the 1,900 respondents had never even talked about it.

I haven't shared my 'secret' with anyone, not even my husband. And my first GP visit saw me stumbling over my words. Aside from the obvious embarrassment, there's the fact people seem to find it acceptable to laugh at urinary incontinence - Ms Mann cites the Little Britain sketch in which David Walliams' old-lady character empties her bladder at inopportune moments.

It is frustrating to see the way the problem is trivialised, says Mark Slack, lead clinician in the department of urogynaecology and pelvic reconstructive surgery at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge.

Much hinges on who women first see when they seek help, he adds. 'A female GP with children of her own is more likely to have read up on the subject and refer you on. But if your first contact is with a 45-year-old, rugby-playing male, your chances of getting the right help are not so good. If the issue is not taken seriously at that first consultation, many women will not return.'

All three specialists are adamant these women have every right to be seen by a specialist, whether it's a urogynaecologist or a physiotherapist specialising in pelvic floor muscles.

And a sheet of teach-yourself pelvic floor exercises alone is not the answer - expert guidance is needed, as some report not knowing if they are doing them correctly. 'Forty per cent of the women I see respond incredibly well to the exercises - but only when properly taught,' says Mr Slack.

For those who don't respond to medication or exercise, surgery is an option (posed by model)

Another option is medication - duloxetine, which is usually prescribed alongside exercises, aims to increase the urethra's muscle tone, so it remains closed and contracts more strongly. Devices such as weights or cones can also be placed in the vagina to help train the pelvic floor. While these have their place, say Ms Mann and Ms Bourne, they caution women should only use them under specialist guidance.

For those who don't respond to medication or exercise, surgery is an option. Surgery aims to tighten or support the muscles and structures below the bladder.

One option is tension-free vaginal tape (TVT), where a sling of synthetic tape is used to support the urethra and bladder neck. But some women report needing the loo more urgently afterwards, or being unable to empty their bladder fully. In some cases, the tape can wear away or break up into fragments and cut into surrounding tissue, causing pain, including during sex.

An alternative is colposuspension, which involves making an incision in the lower abdomen, lifting up the neck of the bladder and stitching it in this lifted position. This provides better support for the bladder neck, so it stays closed under pressure.

But what of those women reading this who have yet to give birth? Luckily, things have moved on since I had my first child. During that labour, I had an episiotomy, a surgical cut in the perineum, between the vagina and the anus.

Research indicates this procedure may be one of the risk factors for stress incontinence, and the rate of episiotomies has dropped from 55 per cent in the Seventies to 15 per cent today. It was originally thought such a cut could help women avoid pelvic floor problems, by preventing serious tears extending into the anal muscle. However, it's thought the body is actually designed to tear naturally away from the sphincter during labour.

Thankfully, experts agree it's never too late to put this condition right. For a start, a 10 per cent weight loss in overweight women results in a 50 per cent improvement in symptoms, says Mr Slack.

After returning to my GP, I was referred to a group session at my local hospital last month. We were talked through correct pelvic floor exercises and will each have a personal follow-up appointment with a continence nurse to check our technique.

If I haven't got the hang of things by then, I'll be offered further instruction until the right treatment for me is found. If all goes to plan, you won't keep me off the trampoline this summer.
