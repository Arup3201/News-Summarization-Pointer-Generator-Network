A  greengrocers has re-opened for business almost 100 years after it served its first customers as an exact replica of how it used to be - complete with war-era produce.

Gertrude Adey transformed her modest front room into a fruit and veg shop in 1916 to earn a few shillings so she could survive while husband William was fighting in the First World War.

The business thrived and the pair served their local community until they retired in the 1930s.

Now, after the historic building was demolished to make way for a new development, it has been lovingly rebuilt, brick-by-brick, down the road in Dudley, West Midlands. 

The time-warp shop only sells produce that was available at the time -  turnips, carrots, beans and potatoes; apples, pears and strawberries - from wooden crates and wicker baskets.

Just like the original, the shop has no electricity supply - it is lit by gas lights and has no fridges.

Rather than precise digital scales, traditional scales are used.

Any left over goods are turned into pickles, chutneys and jams, just as it would have been back in the early 20th century.

And staff are dressed in plain period clothing just as William and Gertrude would have worn.

The opening of the shop is the culmination of a project by local historians who have rebuilt it in the grounds of an open-air museum in Dudley.

Three generations of the Adey family - William’s grandson Jim, 85, great-grandson Andrew, 54, and great-great-granddaughter Melanie, 22 - officially opened the shop last Saturday.

Cherished: The shop, pictured in 1950, thrived and served the local community until Mr and Mrs Adey retired in the 1930s but was then abandoned and later demolished to make way for a new development

Re-built: It has been re-built, brick-by-brick, down the road and still only sells seasonal, war-era produce

Mr Adey, 54, a dentist, said: 'There was a recent article in a local newspaper appealing for information about the Adey family and their connections to a greengrocers’ shop which once stood in Lower Lichfield Street in the town centre of Willenhall.

'I contacted the Black Country Living Museum and told them I was the great-grandson of William Adey and offered to help. I have been charting the family tree over the decades so I got all the information I could together and went to meet the curators.

'To my complete surprise I found out they had actually built an exact replica of the original shop at the museum. They showed me around it and it was like stepping back in time 100 years.

'It was very exciting finding out about it. It is a real legacy for our family. It is fascinating to see staff there selling produce just as my great grandfather and great grandmother would have done.

Tribute: William (left with his son) and Gertrude were icons of the community. Now their grandson Jim, 85 (far right), great-grandson Andrew, 52, and great-great-granddaughter Melanie, 22, (right, centre left) pay tribute

'It’s wonderful that this shop that helped provide for our family 100 years ago is up and running again. We live in a completely different world now and it is great to think the greengrocers will help teach future generations about how we used to live.'

Clare Weston, a curator at the Black Country Living Museum, added: 'The building has been on site since 1995 but we hadn’t done much with it. Last year we decided to restore the shop to its former glory and began researching its past.

'We found out from a trade directory from 1916 that it was a greengrocers run by Gertrude Adey. After a public appeal for information Andrew Adey got in touch and it was a great surprise to him to find his family’s shop had been recreated.

'Mr Adey was able to fill us in on the history of his family and that has helped us bring the shop to life. It’s not just a greengrocers from the turn of the century, it’s a real shop with real people.'
