As a senior school RE teacher,  Rhiannon Fox’s role is to guide children through the moral rules of the world’s religions.

But both her pupils and her headmistress saw a surprisingly different side to her when they discovered her singing an expletive-packed song on the internet – filled with attacks on pupils, and the words ‘I hate my effin’ job’.

Guitar and mandolin-playing Miss Fox, 46, was yesterday off work after being told to stay away from lessons while her conduct is investigated.

'Volatile temper': Teacher Rebecca Fulcher, 30, has been suspended after attacking a former pupil at a nightclub

Rapped: History teacher Rhiannon Fox made a video of herself singing an expletive-ridden song about her school in which she declares: 'I hate my effing job'

While the video has disappeared from 
YouTube, the outspoken RE teacher, a Roman Catholic, has left numerous 
offensive blog posts online.

She even jokes that children and 
parents with a bad attitude should be sterilised and in another blog, 
after saying she ‘enjoys sex’, she announces: ‘I ****ing swear sometimes
because I’m not a bleedin’ nun.’

Her superiors at the Thomas Clarkson 
Academy in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire, may take a while to complete their 
inquiry into her behaviour, though, for they are also investigating 
another teacher, Rebecca Fulcher, 30, after she assaulted a teenage 
former pupil in a nightclub.

Fulcher, who was found guilty of 
clutching her victim round the neck so tightly her fingernails drew 
blood, was given a 12-month conditional discharge, along with her 
boyfriend Daryl Hall, 34. She too has been told to stay away from the 
school.

Miss Fox, a divorcee with a 
22-year-old daughter, had been teaching at the school for around a year.
Her musical hobby only became public when pupils found a video of her 
singing on YouTube.

Investigations ongoing: Both teachers have been suspended from Thomas Clarkson Community College in Wisbech, Cambridgeshire

She was playing the guitar and singing
‘Days of the Week’, which she appears to have written herself, slamming
the school and its pupils with fresh attacks for each day.

For the Friday verse, Miss Fox sang: 
‘I hate my effin’ job.’

The video has been deleted but many of her 
remaining blog posts make clear what she thinks of her pupils and their 
parents.

Under the heading ‘OK parents, the 
real report’, she jokingly reveals the real meaning of comments in 
school reports, translating ‘needs to make more effort’ as ‘your child  
is bone bloody idle’.

She writes that ‘needs to concentrate 
more’ means ‘your child is a pain in the a*** and does my nut in’, 
adding: ‘When the report says your child isn’t working to his 
ability … your child is feral! Please attend your local parenting 
classes!

‘When the report says your child isn’t
achieving due to his attitude and behaviour – please as a matter of 
urgency see your doctor and have both you and your child sterilised 
asap!’

Head Clare Claxton said the video had 
been a hit with pupils but that she expects to be inundated with 
complaints from furious parents.
