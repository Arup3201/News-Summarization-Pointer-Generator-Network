The UK’s biggest banks were last night accused of being ‘fundamentally corrupt’ after selling worthless insurance to up to two million customers.

The victims included vulnerable customers who had contacted their bank after their credit card had been lost or stolen.

They were then duped into paying for insurance to protect themselves against fraudulent transactions made on their replacement card.

But the insurance was useless as banks are legally obliged to refund fraudulent payments to customers anyway.

Typically the policies were sold when people contacted their banks for help over lost or stolen credit cards.

Yesterday the City watchdog announced 11 lenders and credit card firms, including Lloyds, Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, HSBC and Santander, would have to pay compensation for the latest scandal to shame the High Street.

Other big names to have been caught out include Tesco Personal Finance, The Co-operative Bank, Capital One and Clydesdale Bank.

The Financial Conduct Authority said 2million customers who took out ‘card security’ policies will start receiving letters later this month informing them that they could be line for a pay-out.

In many cases customers will have been shelling out annual premiums of between £20 and £40 for insurance they did not need. They could be in line for hundreds of pounds in compensation.

Banks have already had to set aside more than £23billion to compensate customers duped into buying payment protection insurance – with Lloyds alone putting aside more than £11billion.

Attack: Labour MP John Mann (left) said it 'sounds like fraud' and Lord Thurso (right) hit out at 'dodgy products'

Last night MPs expressed exasperation at the banks’ latest transgressions.

Lord Thurso, a former member of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, said: ‘You wonder when banks will learn their lessons and stop selling dodgy products.

‘This is yet another mis-selling scandal which underlines the conclusions we came to in the banking commission that the sales practices used by banks were fundamentally corrupt.’

There are striking similarities between the latest compensation package and a previous mis-selling scandal.

Two years ago it was revealed that up to 7million people were sold card protection policies manufactured by a UK firm, CPP, by the major banks.

A key, but entirely worthless part of these policies was they promised to provide insurance cover for customers if fraudulent transactions were made on their credit cards.

Donna Ettridge (above right) took out a ‘Card Safe’ policy on her M&S credit card in 2001 – but only discovered 12 years later that it has been a waste of money.

Mrs Ettridge, 54, was a regular shopper at M&S, had used an M&S credit card since 1986 and did not expect to be duped into buying insurance which was worthless.

But she was telephoned by a salesman in 2001 and coerced into taking out the policy, even though M&S Bank automatically offers the fraud protection for free.

Mrs Ettridge, a widow from Hornchurch, Essex, is not sure exactly how much she has paid for the policy over the years. But she said: ‘It makes me angry that I’ve paid out for something I did not need every three years for the last 12 years.’

Alok Sharma, a Conservative member of the Treasury Committee, said: ‘This is another awful example of banks mis-selling products. If the sector ever hopes to restore public trust, it needs to pull out all remaining skeletons from the cupboard.’

And Labour MP John Mann said: ‘This sounds like fraud. If this was any other walk of life they’d all be heading straight to prison. It’s very strange that banks haven’t even been fined for this.’

The insurance was provided by a little-known US firm called Affinion, based in Stamford, Connecticut. But the policies were widely sold by the banks, which received money for each sale. 

Now the High Street lenders face having to return hundreds of millions of pounds – plus 8 per cent interest – to customers.

The compensation scheme has to be approved by customers and the High Court before it goes ahead. It will be available to anyone who bought Affinion’s policies between January 14 2005 and August 2013. Given names such as Card Protection, Sentinel Gold and Safe and Secure Plus, the policies cost £25 a year on average but range up to £40.

After receiving an initial letter informing them about the compensation scheme, customers will be sent a follow-up letter in April or May providing them with a voting form.

If they back the scheme, then a High Court hearing will take place on July 9 to approve it. Customers will then have seven months to fill out a form to request compensation, with the first pay-outs expected in the autumn.

The FCA yesterday urged customers to vote for the scheme and said they will be provided with a dedicated helpline and website to assist them.

But last night MP Alok Sharma raised concerns that victims could miss out. He said: ‘I do not think a seven-month time limit for claims is long enough.’

Yesterday RBS, Lloyds and Barclays refused to apologise to customers and HSBC declined to comment. A spokesman from Affinion, which has escaped a fine, said the FCA had not found any fault with the company.
