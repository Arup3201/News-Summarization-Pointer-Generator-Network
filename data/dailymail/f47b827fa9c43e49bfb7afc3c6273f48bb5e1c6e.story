Golden girls of Australian swimming Cate and Bronte Campbell have led an inspiring one, two, three finish in the 100m women's freestyle at the Commonwealth Games.

Less than .18 seconds separated Cate and sister Bronte in a nail-biting finish which almost saw Bronte pull-off one of the great 50m comebacks to haul in her much fancied rival.

Cate was cruising at the 50m turn, almost half a second under the world record, but faded over the last 25m as Bronte stormed home to almost pull off an incredible last-gasp upset.

Sister act: It was a nail-biting finish to the end with just .18s in it when both girls touched the wall

Bronte finished in 52.86 and Cate, on her way to swimming a Commonwealth Games record, finished in 52.68.

In a graceful display of sportsmanship Cate invited both her sister and and McKeown to the top podium to sing the national anthem just a day after Annette Edmondson did after defeating teammate Anna Meares in the cycling pursuit.

It was the second Australian clean sweep in the pool overnight with Brett Larkin beating compatriots Josh Beaver and Matson Lawson in the men's 200m backstroke.

The Campbell battle topped-off an incredible night for Australia which included another podium clean sweep, this time in the men’s 200m backstroke.

Brisbane backstroker Mitch Larkin looks likely to finish as Australia’s most successful individual swimmer of the meet after winning the 200m backstroke in a time of 1:55.83.

Larkin's gold was the first since 1974 that an Australian had won the Games' event, finishining ahead of Australian Josh Beaver (1:56.19) and Matson Lawson (1:56.63) in the bronze spot.

Australia's other two gold medals came in shooting with Warren Potent taking out the 50m rifle prone competition and Laetisha Scanlan  winning the women's trap.

Australia so far has 30 gold medals in total, three ahead of England.
