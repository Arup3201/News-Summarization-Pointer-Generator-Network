Superheroes are being replaced by biblical figures in a series of Hollywood blockbusters to be released next year. 

The films mark a U-turn by movie-makers who appear to be reaching out to America's evangelical heartland. 

Releases include Mary Mother of Christ starring 16-year-old Israeli-born actress Odeya Rush.

A synopsis of the film reads: 'It is a part of Mary, Joseph and Jesus's life that has not been shown before. 

'Under the reign of terror of Herod the Great and against all odds, they survive as young parents in one of the most trecherous times in history.'

In March, the blockbuster Noah starring Russell Crowe and Emma Watson will be released.

The film will see Crowe build an ark and rescue mankind from the Great Flood while Watson plays his adopted daughter. 

The film has cost $150million and promises to be jam-packed with special effects.

Sir Ridley Scott, known for Alien and Blade Runner, directs Exodus starring Christian Bale as Moses and includes a scene where he parts the Red Sea. 

Gods and Kings is another feature film which focuses on the life of Moses. 

Son of God will star Portuguese actor Diogo Morgado as Jesus Christ while Will Smith is believed to be interested in making a film based on Cain and Abel.

Television series The Bible shown on the History channel pulled in an average 11.4million viewers

Phil Cooke, a film-maker and media consultant to Christian organisations, told The Telegraph: 'What's happened is they've understood it's very good buisness to take Christians seriously and this is a real serious market. 

'For years Hollywood bent over backwards to reach special interest groups, be it feminists or environmentalists. It has finally realised that there are 91 million evangelical Christians in America.'

Directors are even inviting pastors to watch screenings before the films are released. 

Websites have also been created for church leaders to download clips to show to their congregation.

Television series The Bible shown on the History channel pulled in an average 11.4million viewers and was America's most watched cable show in 2013.
