As snow moved across north Alabama on Friday, snarling travel and traffic throughout the area, it meant serious conditions for residents in more rural areas.

Sadly the driver of a pickup in Huntsville discovered that the hard way.

Incredible video obtained by the Weather Channel shows the white truck sliding down an iced-over road, picking up speed as it goes and without chance of stopping.

When it crashes into two other vehicles it appears the cars had provided a buffer, but the bump just pushes both down the same frozen slope.
