Rep. Trent Franks got in hot water Tuesday when his argument against a rape exception in a bill limiting access to abortion was compared to campaign-ending comments last August from Missouri U.S. Senate candidate Todd Akin

Congressman Trent Franks, an Arizona Republican who is advocating for a bill that would ban abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy, putting back on the front burner an embarrassing episode from the 2012 election season.

A Missouri Republican Senate candidate lost the female vote by 22 percentage points last year after claiming in August that the human body naturally protects victims of 'legitimate rape' from becoming pregnant.

Franks similarly dismissed on Tuesday the idea that women who have been raped should be permitted to terminate their pregnancies whenever they choose.

He recalled past debates 'when my friends on the left side of the aisle here tried to make rape and incest the subject.'

'Because, you know, the incidence of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low.'

'But when you make that exception, there’s usually a requirement to report the rape within 48 hours. And in this case that’s impossible because this is in the sixth month of gestation.'

Todd Akin, a former congressman who lost his bid to unseat Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in a landslide in November, faced national condemnation - and was abandoned by the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee - after saying that ‘if it’s a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to shut that whole thing down.’

Akin later tried to walk his statement back, clarifying that by 'legitimate rape,' he meant to focus on cases where women have made false claims about being sexually assaulted.

Republican U.S. Senate candidate Todd Akin's campaign came to an ignominious end after he said in August that victims of 'legitimate rape' are protected from pregnancies by their own female bodies

Rep. Franks and his staff have been similarly backing off of Tuesday's statement, and insisting that he didn't mean to suggest anything along the lines of Akin's controversial foot-in-mouth moment.

'The congressman's intended point,' wrote communications director Ben Carnes in an email to MailOnline, 'was regarding the number of abortions after the beginning of the 6th month' of pregnancy ... not the number of rapes that result in pregnancies.'

The bill under debate, which Franks sponsored and which the House Judiciary Committee approved Wednesday on a 20-12 vote, would take effect in the third trimester of gestation, and Franks addressed this directly in a statement to MailOnline.

'Pregnancies from rape that result in abortion after the beginning of the sixth month are very rare,' he claimed.

'This bill does not address unborn children in earlier gestations. Indeed, the bill does nothing to restrict abortions performed before the beginning of the 6th month.'

California Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren let loose on Franks: 'The idea that Republican men on this committee think they can tell the women of America that they have to carry to term the product of a rape is outrageous'

Still, Democratic partisans are hopping mad and quickly tried to link Franks with Akin.

'Like Akin's, Franks's claim is not supported by research,' wrote the liberal Huffington Post.

'Medical experts agree that rape does not lower the incidence of pregnancy, and one study by the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology found that more than 30,000 pregnancies result from rape in the United States each year.'

And The Washington Post noted a 2011 study from San Francisco State University that studied women in the South American nation of Colombia, concluding that 'female youth who have experienced sexual violence report significantly higher levels of unintended pregnancy ... compared to those who have not experienced sexual violence.'

After Akin's comment made national news in August 2012, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists reported that between 10,000 and 15,000 women in the U.S. obtain abortions each year following rape- or incest-related pregnancies

The Center for Research on Gender and Sexuality at San Francisco State University found that rape victims in Colombia were more likely to become pregnant

'There is absolutely no veracity' to Akin's claim, the organization insisted. to the claim that

'A woman who is raped has no control over ovulation, fertilization, or implantation of a fertilized egg (ie, pregnancy). To suggest otherwise contradicts basic biological truths.'

Franks' bill, The District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, includes an exception for women whose pregnancies are measured at 20 weeks or longer whose lives are threatened if they don't abort their pregnancies.

Frank Thorp, an NBC News producer who covers Capitol Hill, interviewed Franks Tuesday evening and reported that the congressman said 'the reality is, it's not Republicans that are talking about this. It's Democrats that keep forcing the rape issue into this debate. They've done it ever since Roe v. Wade.'

Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat, leapt into the debate Tuesday after Franks made his position known, arguing that no man should be making health policy which could affect young women.. that her colleagues were in not a position understand what goes on in the life or mind of a young girl in crisis.

'The idea that Republican men on this committee think they can tell the women of America that they have to carry to term the product of a rape is outrageous,' she said.

Franks said in a statement after the Judiciary Committee's vote that “[k]nowingly subjecting our innocent unborn children to dismemberment in the womb, particularly when they have developed to the point that they can feel excruciating pain every terrible moment leading up to their undeserved deaths, belies everything America was called to be.'

'This is not who we are.'
