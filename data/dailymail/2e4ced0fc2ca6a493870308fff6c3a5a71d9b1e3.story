A video apparently showing a Western man abusing a young Korean woman has sparked outrage across the country after it went viral on the internet.

The 78-second clip shows a young Western club-goer with an American accent grabbing the woman around her face before repeatedly poking her in her mouth and nose while a third person films it.

After poking the woman in nose, the man then can be heard shouting: 'I see a booger' while his friend eggs him on, saying: 'Dude, make her eat it.'Â

Abuse: But despite the woman's protestations, the man continues to force her face towards the camera

The two men can then be heard laughing as he pushes his finger in to her mouth at the unnamed nightclub in South Korea.

They then continue to abuse the girl by telling her she is disgusting and tells her she needs plastic surgery 'like every other little Korean'.

The woman, who appears to be worse-for-wear, apparently tells the man to leave her alone and tries to push him away.
