Queens Park Rangers midfielder Sandro is facing a spell on the sidelines after injuring his knee while celebrating a goal in training.

The former Tottenham star, who missed much of last season after a serious knee injury, scored and slid on his knees to celebrate.

But because the dryness of the pitch at the Harlington training ground, the Brazilian hurt his knee.

DAVE BEASANT: Severed the tendon in his big toe after dropping salad cream on it in 1993. 

DAVID JAMES: Once pulled a muscle in his back when reaching for the remote control.

RIO FERDINAND: During his spell at Leeds, the England defender managed to pick up a tendon strain in his knee watching television.

DAVID BATTY: Managed to re-injure his Achilles tendon when he was run over by his toddler on a tricycle

It caused him to miss the 2-2 draw with Stoke on Saturday and manager Harry Redknapp is facing an anxious wait over how long he will be without the midfielder.

It looks almost certain he will miss Saturday’s trip to in-form Southampton and is facing a race against time to be fit for the London derby against West Ham the following weekend.

The bizarre injury set-back has frustrated Redknapp, who is already without Joey Barton and Jordon Mutch through injury.

Redknapp confirmed to talkSPORT: ‘Sandro injured his knee after scoring a goal in training and sliding on the dry ground celebrating.’

Sandro admitted he nearly retired in 2012 when a knee problem ruled him out for an entire season.

The South American only arrived at Loftus Road in a £10million deal on transfer deadline day.
