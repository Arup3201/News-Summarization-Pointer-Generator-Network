The X-Factor singer who claims the cut-glass accent that has captured the nation's imagination is a product of elocution lessons - and not her upbringing - attended a £31,000-a-year private school, it has been revealed.

Chloe-Jasmine Whichello, 23, of Wells, Somerset, said her well-spoken tone was down to speech therapy she received at the age of 11 to cure a lisp and was nothing to do with a privileged background.

But the model, who stunned judges with a dazzling blues-soaked performance on last night's show, attended Canford School in Wimborne, Dorset, which is set in over 250 acres of grounds on the banks of the River Stour and features a boathouse for rowing, a 294-seat theatre seating and an art gallery.

Miss Whichello, who once said: 'When people meet me they always say, "You are the poshest girl I’ve ever met in my life"', claims treatment for her speech problem caused her upper-class accent.

She said: ‘I had elocution lessons in order to speak properly.'

'I literally couldn’t even formulate a sentence my lisp was so bad. It was terrible actually because I was too scared to speak.’

The singer admitted that boarding school and her modelling career had also helped to cement her speech, adding: ‘If people think it’s posh I am really sorry. I am not royalty.’

Chloe-Jasmine, who speaks fluent French, German and Portuguese, had planned to study law but instead took up modelling at 18.

Her parents Garry, 55, and Denise, 57, live in the heart the prestigious village of Wells.

The house has at least three floors - a ground floor with a large entrance hall, upstairs and a basement.

The kitchen can be seen through the large Edwardian single glaze windows and takes up the whole left hand side of the house.

Prices in the street are worth between £350,000 to £500,000.

They are just a short walk from the glorious Wells cathedral, the quaint shops in the centre, and a large Waitrose is just around the corner.

Their house is also just a two minute walk from the holistic health practice they own, the Beaumont Natural Health Centre.

It is down a narrow cobbled road and offers osteopathy , massage, reflexology, hypnotherapy and acupuncture.

Chloe-Jasmine said she was thrilled and shocked by the judges’ reaction.

‘I didn’t expect such a positive reaction because I haven’t had a singing lesson since school,’ she added.

The young hopeful first auditioned in 2007, but did not make it on screen as the judges did not think she was ready.

She was criticised by Simon Cowell, who claimed the then-16-year-old represented the generation of teenagers who only sought fame.

But last year she appeared on TV modelling contest The Face and she said the cut-throat world of the catwalk had prepared her.

‘I have interacted with a cacophony of people and that has made me think that life is very short and what is the worst thing that can happen,’ she said.

However, she has no intention of being a wild child. ‘I am completely teetotal,’ she said. ‘I don’t really see the point of going out and getting really drunk.’

Canford School hit the headlines recently when a teacher was cleared of engaging in sexual activity with a ‘flirty’ female pupil.

Russell Woolwright, 30, said the false allegations had forced him to resign from his job as an economics teacher at the Dorset School attended by Miss Whichello, where he had worked for five years.

The girl, who was 17 at the time, sent Mr Woolwright a series of inappropriate emails – but he insisted there had been no sexual contact.

After having to endure a four-day trial in which he was charged with making the teenager perform a sex act on him during an encounter in an alleyway, he said the system leaves all the ‘power with the pupils and not with the teachers’.

Mr Woolwright met up with the girl after she pestered him with a string of lewd emails including one she titled ‘party in my pants’ in October.

He said he told the girl to stop contacting him and twice backed away when she tried to kiss him.

After the police later learnt of the email exchange between the pair, the girl ‘embellished’ her version of events and claimed she carried out the sex act.

But a jury took just 90 minutes to find him not guilty of two counts of causing or inciting sexual activity with a girl as an adult in a position of trust.
