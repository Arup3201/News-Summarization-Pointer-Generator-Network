Former pizza delivery man Ala Uddin, 44, who worked for Domino'­s despite his violent past and appalling driving record

A pizza delivery driver has kept a job with Domino's despite finally being banned from the road after clocking up an astonishing 35 points on his licence and being exposed as a convicted child murderer.

Ala Uddin, 44, was given a job delivering pizzas in Aberystwyth, west Wales, despite his violent past and appalling driving record.

He was one of just 10 drivers in the UK who managed to stay on the road despite racking up 28 or more points.

On one occasion he was handed 18 points in one go after he pleaded guilty to a string of motoring offences.

But he avoided a ban after making an exceptional hardship plea in his court hearing, claiming he 
would lose his job and ultimately end up losing the home he provides for
 his wife and children.

In court it was revealed Uddin
 was jailed for murder in 1993 for knifing a 15-year-old boy to death in
 a row sparked by religious differences.

He served seven years and 
remains on licence for life for the murder.

Uddin was jailed again in Swansea, in 2009, for two years - reduced to one on
 appeal - for knifing a colleague at a meat processing plant in Llanybydder the 
face.

Uddin has worked as a pizza delivery driver for Domino's takeaway in Aberystwyth for more than two years.

Since his ban last week he's been moved to a job behind the counter.

Domino's
 pizza chain refused to comment. But the local franchise-holder confirmed that Uddin is still employed inside the takeaway outlet.

He said: 'I have been told by Domino's that I must not say anything more.'

As a murder conviction is never spent, 
it would have had to have been declared to an employer.

Criminal records checks on takeaway 
delivery drivers are not generally made by employers and it raises the 
question of how many other drivers have serious criminal convictions.

Ceredigion MP Mark Williams said: 'I was concerned to read 
about this case, and believe sufficient safeguards should always be in 
place to protect the public.

'It
 is important that companies ask enough information about their staff to
 make an informed decision about their suitability for the role, and 
most importantly any risk that they may pose.'

A
 spokesperson at Domino's head office said: 'As a franchised business, 
we rely on our franchisees to recruit and manage team members in stores,
 and we can not comment on individual cases.'

Uddin appeared in court in January when he was allowed to keep his licence despite building up 29 penalty points.

He had claimed a ban would see him suffer exceptional hardship.

Aberystwyth Magistrates' Court, where it was revealed Ala Uddin was a convicted child murderer

But last Wednesday, Uddin, of Ffosyffin, near Aberaeron, west Wales, was finally banned from driving for six months after pleading guilty to further charges of driving with a defective tyre and without insurance

The previous convictions were not mentioned when he appeared before Aberystwyth magistrates for the motoring offence.

Prosecutor Ellie Morgan said Uddin was stopped by Pc Phil Westbury on January 28 at Heol y Bont in Penparcau, Ceredigion.

Ala Uddin is not the only serial offender who the courts allowed to continue driving on British roads.

The Institute of Advanced Motorists said DVLA figures show that one woman from Isleworth in west London amassed 42 points last year.

In that case, the 42 points were all dished out for failing to disclose the driver’s identity.

The second-highest points total - 36 - for a person still allowed to keep their license were given to a man from Warrington, Cheshire, who was caught driving without insurance six times in less than two weeks between February and March last in 2012, the IAM said.

A spokesman for HM Courts & Tribunals Service said: 'The vast majority of drivers who get 12 or more penalty points are fined and disqualified from driving.

'Magistrates can use their discretion to not enforce a driving ban if doing so would cause exceptional hardship, such as losing a job or the ability to care for a dependant. A fine will still be enforced.'

A DVLA spokesman said: 'The DVLA’s role is to record the information 
provided by the courts. The courts are able to use their discretion to 
decide whether or not to disqualify a driver.'

Checks showed the tread on the front nearside wheel of the Honda Civic he was driving was worn.

Further checks also showed that an insurance policy Uddin had was invalidated by the insurers and backdated to when the policy was first taken out, after he failed to declare prior convictions.

Defence solicitor Alison Mathias said Uddin had realised he had to be careful after escaping a ban initially. She said he had checked his car, but that even Pc Westbury had not been able to tell at first the tyre was defective and only realised it was after using a gauge.

Ms Mathias said Uddin had an insurance certificate that covered him on the day, but that his insurers had invalidated the policy and backdated that invalidation after learning he had not informed the company of previous convictions.

She said that Uddin hoped he would be able to keep his job at Domino's and work in the takeaway itself.

But he realised that if the company could find a staff member who was not banned, he was at risk of losing his job, which would have a major impact on his family.

Ms Mathias added: 'He wishes to apologise to the court for coming before the court in respect of motoring offences.'

Uddin was given six points for the no insurance charge, taking him to 35 points, and was banned for six months under the totting-up procedure. He was also fined £220 and will pay costs of £97.

According to the most recent DVLA figures only five people in Britain have been allowed to keep their licence with 30 points, one driver is on 31 points, one is on 34 points, one is on 36 points and one driver in the Liverpool area has a whopping 45 points on his licence but is allowed to remain driving.
