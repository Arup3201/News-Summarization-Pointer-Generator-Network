Two miners have made a lot of people's Valentine's Day more bearable by posting a hilarious video online of  them singing and dancing to a famous Whitney Houston love song.

While they can't believe the global attention they have received, 27-year-old Jamie Byers from Perth and 26-year-old Jason Allen from Cairns told Daily Mail Australia they made the video to give people who are away from their loved ones on Valentine's Day a bit of a laugh.

The men, who both work on the same site in Pannawonica, Western Australia, which is 1,400km north of Perth, are astounded that their video, in which they lip-sync to Whitney Houston's 'I Wanna Dance With Somebody', has already been viewed over 470,000 times in the last 23 hours.

The video comes just weeks after a lip-syncing US cop became a worldwide phenomenon after a video appeared online of him enthusiastically lip-syncing to Taylor Swift's 'Shake it Off'.

Jamie, a plumber who is away from his girlfriend Brooke, missing Valentine's Day, said he never thought there would be such a huge reaction to the funny video, entitled 'Valentine's day in the pilbara [sic]'.

'Yeah it's taken off alright' Jamie told Daily Mail Australia. 

'We both knew it was funny and we thought we would get a few likes - not to this extent'

In the hilarious video, Jamie and Jason lip-sync to each other, fist pump, sway their heads in unison and appear to have synchronised their dance routine. 

The men dance in perfect harmony to the music while Jason drives the car, getting into the spirit of Valentine's Day with their feel-good video.  

The men say they created the video to give people who are away from the loved ones on Valentine's Day a bit of a laugh

The men both work on the same site in Pannawonica, Western Australia, which is 1,400km north of Perth,

Jason, who is single, works as a refrigeration mechanic and is based in the town of Pannawonica. Along with Jamie, they both service two mine sites nearby. 

Jamie said the video was meant to be a joke to get people's minds off being in the mines and away from their loved ones on the 14th of February.   

'It was a joke, mainly just to give people who are working away from their love ones a bit of a laugh on Valentine's Day,' he said. 

Jamie has worked in the mining town for nearly a year while Jason has been there for two years. 

While the men's video may be a hit worldwide, they're not sure whether or not they'll will be the next  Simon and Garfunkel.

'We can hope but I don't think so, I'm not sure if you can tell but we were only lip syncing.'

Jamie posted a similar video to his Facebook page last year on Valentine's Day where he lip-synced to Tina Turner's 'What's Love Got To  Do With It'. However the video did not receive the same attention as his current one.

The video bares a striking resemblance to a video which appeared online in September of a Delaware police officer enthusiastically lip-syncing to Taylor Swift's 'Shake it Off'.

The video, posted to the Dover Police Department's Facebook page, showed Master Cpl. Jeff Davis in uniform driving a patrol car while lip-syncing to the popular pop song - sassy head rolls and finger-pointing included.

The video comes only weeks after a cop in the US became a worldwide phenomenon after a video appeared online showing him lip-syncing to Taylor Swift's 'Shake It Off'

The video appeared too perfect and internet-ready for the scene to be spontaneous - but that didn't stop it from racking up more than 500,000 views in a matter of days.

Department spokesman Cpt. Mark Hoffman said Saturday that he's gotten calls about the video from media outlets in Australia, England, Germany, and throughout the U.S. 

It has reached more than 470,000 YouTube views.

Hoffman says Davis, a 19-year veteran of the department, is 'the class clown' and loved making the video. 

He says the 48-year-old father of four knows 'Shake it Off' so well because of his 10-year-old daughter.
