Harry Redknapp believes Jose Mourinho could surpass Sir Alex Ferguson’s achievements at Manchester United and become the greatest manager ever.

Redknapp takes his Queens Park Rangers side to face Mourinho’s unbeaten Chelsea on Saturday.

The Portuguese is in only his second year of his second spell at Stamford Bridge but already looks to have all the pieces in place to compete on all fronts this season.

Mourinho has hopped from club to club in the past decade, winning titles and trophies at Porto, Chelsea, Inter Milan and Real Madrid, but Redknapp is adamant he can create a legacy to rival Ferguson’s if he stays where he is for the long term.

Redknapp said: ‘Absolutely I think he can do what Fergie did at Manchester United. If he wanted to stay at Chelsea for the next 15 years he could do it. He’s only going to be successful there. He’s at the right club with the right chairman.

‘He’s proved that he’s a fantastic manager wherever he has been. You don’t go and win Champions Leagues like he has unless you’re a top manager, but to be a top manager it helps if you have top players. 

'He has top players and he knows how to get the best out of them and put teams together.

‘He’s going to be in the game for many years to come and he could end up as the greatest manager of all time.’

The list of great managers is a subjective one, but undoubtedly includes the names of Brian Clough, Rinus Michels, Bob Paisley, Helenio Herrera, Sir Matt Busby and Bill Shankly. But Redknapp is certain Mourinho is in the right place to top them all.

He added: ‘Good luck to Mourinho. His record at Milan, wherever he’s been, Porto, tells you he is a top manager. He’s got a charisma about him and has got a great knowledge of the game.

‘He’s been excellent. I couldn’t fault him. His record could be up there with the very, very best in the world. He’s got every chance of winning the Champions League with Chelsea.’
