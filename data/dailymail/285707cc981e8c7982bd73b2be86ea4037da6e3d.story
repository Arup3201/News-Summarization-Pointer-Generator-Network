Tangled: Lydia Bishop was pronounced dead in 
hospital after she suffered serious injuries in the play area at 
York College Nursery, York

A three-year-old girl died after becoming tangled in ropes on playground equipment on her first day at her nursery, it has been revealed. 

Lydia Bishop was pronounced dead in hospital after she suffered serious injuries in the play area at the £42-a-day York College Nursery, York, yesterday afternoon. Police have confirmed it was the girl's first day at nursery.

She is thought to have used a 5ft metal slide at the college’s nursery and then become stuck on the ropes that were part of another piece of equipment.

It is not known whether she fell from the slide onto the ropes.

Det Chief Insp Nigel Costello said a 
full investigation was now underway at the nursery to establish how the 
accident happened and if it could have been prevented.

The nursery is to remain shut until at least early next week.

Parents of other children who attend the nursery paid tribute as they arrived to lay flowers.

Mother-of-two Claire Gibb, 36, a marketing officer whose two children have been attending the nursery since March, said: 'It's an amazing place. I always felt at ease leaving my kids here.

'I've noticed that whenever there were kids playing on the slide there was 
always somebody supervising it.

'I can't imagine what the little girl's parents are going through right now. My heart to their whole family.'

Another mother, Rebecca Thompson, 40, also laid flowers and a card, reading: 'To a lovely little girl, rest with the angels'.

She said her three-year-old son had only been going to the nursery for a week and she believed it was the little girl's first day there when tragedy struck.

'It is so sad, it doesn't even bear thinking about, everyone expects to pick their child up from nursery don't they?'

Inspectors were at the scene today taking photographs of the slide and a black rope that appeared to be tied around the side of it.

The City of York Safeguarding Children Board's (CYSCB) Manager, Joe Cocker, released a statement announcing a major review into the incident was taking place.

He said: 'A multi-agency investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of this young child is underway, involving the police, City of York Safeguarding Children Board (CYSCB), Ofsted and the Health & Safety Executive.

'The CYSCB is working closely with partners to coordinate the enquiries of the various agencies in order to understand what happened and why it happened.

'Most importantly, at this stage, there is a need to ensure that support is provided to the family, the families of children who attend the nursery and the nursery staff.

'The investigation is at a very early stage and it would be inappropriate to comment further at this time.'

In a statement the college said it was 
'devastated' and said it was doing all it could to help the authorities 
with their investigation into the tragedy.

North Yorkshire Police said they did not believe there were any suspicious circumstances.

The
scene was last night cordoned off while officers investigated the 
incident and Ofsted and the Health and Safety Executive were informed.

Officers were called to the area on Sim Balk Lane at around 2.35pm yesterday by the ambulance service.

The college said in a statement: 'York
College is absolutely devastated at the news of the very sad death of a
child, following a tragic incident at the York College Nursery.

Police officers stand guard at the scene of the accident in York, where a little girl died after suffering serious injuries in a playground

'Our thoughts are with the child’s family and the children, families and staff at York College Nursery.

'Currently, York College staff are helping the emergency services with their enquiries and the nursery is closed today. Parents have been informed and will be kept updated with any further developments.'

A spokesman for the City of York 
Council said: 'All relevant agencies are aware and will be working 
together over the next few days.

'Our thoughts are with the family of the child and staff at the nursery.'

The
police spokesman said: ‘At this stage, police do not believe there are 
any suspicious circumstances and it appears that the girl has become 
entangled in a piece of play equipment.

‘The
police are carrying out an investigation into the incident to establish
exactly what happened and would like anyone who was in the area at the 
time to contact them.’

The scene has been cordoned off while officers investigate the incident. Ofsted and the Health and Safety Executive have been informed

Lydia was attending York College’s nursery, which offers day-care for 112 children aged six weeks to five years.

As well as caring for children of the college’s students, aged between 16 and 19, it also provides work placements – although the nursery’s website states that students on such placements are never left unsupervised with children.

Ofsted inspectors said the nursery was 'good' in its September 2009 inspection and praised the play area saying: ‘Children use the superb outdoor facilities with gusto, as they have ample opportunities to be active and improve their skills of co-ordination, control, manipulation and movement.

'They thoroughly enjoy, digging, climbing, balancing, crawling, building and observing the world around them.’

The nursery’s website states that students on work placements are never left unsupervised with children.
