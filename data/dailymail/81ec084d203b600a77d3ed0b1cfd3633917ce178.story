Thousands of patients are dying due to a lack of doctors in England's worst hospitals, according to a new study.

Hospitals currently being investigated for having high death rates employ far fewer doctors per patient than others, academics have discovered.

While many think hospitals provide similar standards of care, the Plymouth University team found wide variations in staffing levels. A&E departments are particularly stretched, warn doctors.

Professor Sheena Asthana and Dr Alex Gibson made their conclusions after looking at staffing in 14 hospital trusts recently identified as having high death rates.

Concerns: Thousands of patients are dying due to a lack of doctors in England's worst hospitals

These are now the subject of a review ordered by Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt and being led by NHS Medical Director Sir Bruce Keogh.

The researchers found that on average these troubled hospitals have 17 per cent fewer doctors per 100 beds than those not under investigation.

They also have five per cent fewer nurses and 22 per cent fewer cleaners.

Those being investigated have on average only 56 doctors per 100 beds, while those not being reviewed have 68.

Four of the 14 trusts - which run hospitals in Tameside, Dudley, Cumbria and Blackpool - have fewer than 50 doctors per 100 beds.

By comparison, Guy's and St Thomas' in London - the best-staffed hospital trust in the country - has 125. Its death rate is 22 per cent lower than the average.

Prof Asthana said the shortage of doctors was costing lives.

'The health service needs large numbers of staff on the front line to deliver good quality care,' she said.

Her views were backed up by Professor Brian Jarman, an expert on hospital death rates, and a member of Sir Bruce's review panel.

He said lower death rates were 'very strongly associated with more doctors per bed'.

Prof Jarman recently calculated almost 3,000 people may have died unnecessarily at the 14 trusts under investigation in one year. He said staffing levels were too often ignored, despite evidence a lack of doctors costs lives.

Dr Patrick Cadigan, registrar of the Royal College of Physicians, said: 'The most shocking example of this is A&Es. They probably have only half the number of doctors they need for safe staffing.'

Julie Bailey, who founded the group Cure the NHS, said: 'If you don't have enough staff, patients suffer.' She launched the group when her mother Bella died after being dropped on the floor by staff at Stafford Hospital.

Sir Bruce Keogh said: 'Staffing levels are being investigated as part of my review into mortality levels.'

Peter Walsh, chief executive of Action for Victims of Medical Accidents, said: 'Adequate staffing is an important factor in safe care and treatment of patients and it is concerning these trusts have less doctors and nurses.'
