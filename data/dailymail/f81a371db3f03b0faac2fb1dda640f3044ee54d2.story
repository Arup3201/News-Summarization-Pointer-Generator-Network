Two best friends who drifted 10 miles out to sea when their jet-ski broke down revealed yesterday that they considered drowning themselves.

Gavin Smith, 28, and Ben Thomson, 32, spent more than three hours in the icy waters of the North Sea near the Tay Estuary, off the coast of St Andrews, after a jet-ski they had been riding broke down.

Another friend on his own jet-ski returned to shore to raise the alarm but by the time lifeboats were launched they had started to drift and three hours later they had travelled 10 miles.

Mr Smith, who has a two-year-old son, said: 'When you are that cold, it was easy just to lie back and accept death. It felt warmer when you lay back.

'The
two of us tried to drown ourselves, but if one of us went down the 
other one would pick them up. We just kept talking about the children 
the whole time.'

Agonisingly for the two men, both of Dundee, a rescue helicopter was summoned but did not detect them.

The pair could also see the lights of 
lifeboats scouring the waters off Broughty Ferry, Angus and Fife and were finally saved after Mr Thomson found the strength to blow on a 
whistle attached to his best friend's lifejacket.

The two fathers had the rhyme made up by their children - 'Love You Lots Like Jelly Tots' - tattooed on
their arms as these were the words they repeated continuously to help keep each other alive

Mr Smith revealed the two men recited a poignant
rhyme created by his son, Quinn, and Ben's daughter Jessica, five, 
which included calling out the words 'Love you lots,' 
while the other screamed back, 'Jelly tots.'

Mr Smith,said: 'The helicopter flew right over us and
once it had been and gone I thought we were done for, I can't tell you 
how relieved we were when the lifeboat spotted us.

'We've both got kids 
and there were a few moments where we weren't sure if we would see them 
again.'

Mr Thomson said: 'It 
was a series of events that got us into the situation we were in - by the
time Arbroath lifeboat picked us up we were in a really bad way.

'I just
want to express my thanks to the crew. Without them I don't know if I 
would be here today.'

The dramatic rescue in November saw the men become two of 1,055 people plucked to safety by RNLI volunteers in Scotland last year, in what was this week announced as a record-breaking 12 months for the service.

For the second consecutive year, Broughty Ferry was the busiest of the country's 46 stations with 103 launches and 37 rescues.

Mr Smith and Mr Thomson visited RNLI Arbroath lifeboat station before Christmas with a few boxes of beer and a card Ben's son had made with the words: 'Thank you for saving my Daddy and my Uncle, it means the world to me.'

Other statistics revealed by the RNLI this week show there were 1,008 launches across Scotland last year, and 29 more rescues than the previous highest count in 2006.

A total of 386 shouts took place at night and the busiest inshore station was at Queensferry, near Edinburgh.

More than 15,450 hours were spent at sea by Scottish crews in 2012.

Regional operations manager for Scotland, Andy Clift, said: 'The figures show that our volunteers dedicate a huge amount of their time to saving lives at sea.'
