A young man who gave up his job to pursue his passion of BASE jumping has died after what appears to be a botched jump in Glacier National Park.

Beau Weiher, of Missoula, Montana, fell to his death on Saturday after heading out to do a solo jump on the summit of Mount Siyeh.

His body was discovered by authorities on Sunday.

Extreme passion: Weiher (on bottom) had quit his job as a carpenter to focus on his passion of BASE jumping full time

'We don’t know whether he had attempted the jump at the time of his fall, or not, but he was attached to his parachute when the body was recovered,' said Glacier Park spokeswoman Denise Germann.

Weiher, 22,  quit his job as a carpenter in early 2013 to spend his time BASE jumping, getting by on his very limited savings. 

'In order to accomplish my goals, I eliminate any expenses that do not contribute to my plan. Since my last video, I have sold my truck and stopped paying for fuel and insurance,' he said in an interview with The Adrenalist.

'This may seem extreme to most; however, it has allowed me to become the person I want to be.'

He added, 'If you can’t make sacrifices for your dreams, you should probably choose bigger dreams.'

Memories: 'My adventure buddy, my soulmate, my Beau.I love you so much. See you at the top,' Doll (left, with Weiher) wrote on her Facebook on Monday

His girlfriend, Rebecca Doll, remembered her partner in a touching Facebook post on Monday, writing, 'My adventure buddy, my soulmate, my Beau. 

I love you so much. See you at the top!'

Weiher is the seventh person this year to die while BASE jumping, and the fourth in the United States.
