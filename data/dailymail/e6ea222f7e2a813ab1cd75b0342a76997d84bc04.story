The parents of a toddler have hit out after their son was expelled from a nursery following a row over him being bitten by another child.

Stacey Morris went to see bosses of Lilliputs Day Nursery in Westhoughton, Lancashire after her 14-month-old son Lewis was bitten three times in six months.

After threatening the refer the matter to Ofsted, she was left furious when she was told Lewis could no longer attend the nursery.

A letter sent to her by the nursery's owner states that it has a 'zero tolerance approach to threats and intimidation'.

Stacy Morris says her 14-month-old son Lewis Nestor was unfairly expelled from his nursery after she complained about him being bitten by another child

Miss Morris and her partner Thomas Nestor said Lewis was very settled at the nursery and liked the staff who looked after him.

But she and Lewis's grandmother went to see owner Gill Green after the bite marks appeared for a third time.

Miss Morris insists she was not aggresive in the meeting and only said: 'If you don't do anything about this I will get Ofsted involved.'

She was left shocked when, later in the week, she received the letter informing her of Lewis's expulsion.

Mrs Green stated in the letter: 'This is not a decision that I have taken lightly, but [I] feel that our relationship is irreparable.

'Please do not attempt to attend the nursery at any point, my decision is final.'

Miss Morris, who also has a four-year-old daughter, Madison,said: 'He's only been at the nursery since May this year and in that time he's been bitten three times.

'He was bitten twice in six days in August and on the first occasion staff didn't even phone me up to tell me - I only found out when I picked him up.'

The owner of Lilliputs Day Nursery in Westhoughton, Lancashire says it has a 'zero tolerance approach to intimidation', but Miss Morris says she only threatened to refer them to education watchdog Ofsted

She added:'It was shocking really because he would have been so scared - he wasn't even one at the time.

The mother-of-two said she had to have time off work while she tried to find Lewis alternative childcare.

She told The Bolton News: 'Lewis has never done anything wrong. We have always been co-operative with the nursery and then I get this letter.

'I am hurt that now my innocent son's routine will be in uproar as he was very happy at Lilliputs and settled with the staff in his room. 

'I feel I have been unfairly treated because they are unable to control another child's behaviour.'

Mrs Green, owner of Lilliputs, told the local newspaper: 'We do not exclude a family for nothing and we welcome parents' feedback to help us improve and deal with things to the best of our ability.

'We don't do this lightly. We go through the correct channels and have worked with Ofsted in this case.

'We have found it necessary to put a zero tolerance approach in place with regard to threats and aggression.'

The letter told Miss Morris not to contact the nursery as their relationship was 'irreparable'
