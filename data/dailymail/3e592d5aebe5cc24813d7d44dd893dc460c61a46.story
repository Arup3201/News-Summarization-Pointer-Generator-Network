While working behind-the-scenes with celebrities may be a dream job for some, Penny Hunt says being a stylist isn't as glamorous as it seems.

The mother-of-one, who's been in the fashion industry for 14 years, has worked with the likes of Asher Keddie, Chris Hemsworth, Deborra-Lee Furness, Heath Ledger, Ian Thorpe, Lara Bingle, Melanie Lynskey and Missy Higgins, Rachael Taylor and Teresa Palmer. The list is endless.

Ms Hunt, whose own style has evolved from being the Carrie Bradshaw of Sex and the City to classics and comfort, shared some of her favourite shoots and her personal experiences as a celebrity stylist.

'I really love working with Jessica Marais [from Packed to the Rafters],' Ms Hunt told Daily Mail Australia.

'She’s got it all going on. She’s beautiful, a lovely person, down-to-earth and very fun to work with. She is is such a warm and humble star and has the beauty of an old Hollywood glamour.

Ms Hunt made particular mention of a Sydney shoot where she had the chance to work with loved-up Marais and her beau James Stewart.

'It was an amazing shoot and the two had just gotten engaged,' she said. 'Working with the couple was so easy and it helps that they're both so gorgeous.'

While other highlights of her career including being flown around the world by Louis Vuitton to work on their shoots, one of Ms Hunt's memorable location is Australia's very own Uluru in the Northern Territory.

'I've done shoots there a few times and I've got to say that it's just breathtakingly beautiful,' she said.

So working on set with glamour model Jennifer Hawkins was no exception.

'It was a phenomenal shoot but it rained half the day - we couldn't believe it,' Ms Hunt said.

'We were standing in the desert and thought "what the hell is going on?". But in the end, that shoot stands out for me because I got to see Jen in a different manner compared to all the other commercial campaigns she's done and I've worked with her for such a long time.'

However working on such shoots comes with its demands.

'It's so much fun but it's definitely not glamorous,' Ms Hunt said.

'On a day-to-day basis, I'm either running around in my Havaianas or Converse and trying to visit 50 different places to grab everything I need for the shoot.

'By the end of the day I'm frazzeled, my hair is crazy and I'm dirty. Overall it's a demanding job and the hours are pretty long.'

And now comes a new challenge - being a mother.

'It's also the best job I have ever had,' she laughed.

'But in terms of styling the most challenging would be hands down dressing footballers like the All Blacks and Wallabies only for the fact they have huge thighs, broad chests and shoulders and some it's almost impossible to fit unless its custom made.'

Ms Hunt's most star-struck moment would have to be the time she met the late Heath Ledger.

'It was when he was filming Candy and the shoot was for an international magazine cover story,' she said.

'He was such a soft and humorous man with this clear, gleaming skin because he hadn't been in the sun to look more in character.

'He chatted openly with all the crew and sat around at lunch like he was an old friend from school - cheeky, handsome and charming.'

But her most admirable celebrity and style icon is Cate Blanchett - whom Ms Hunt had the chance to style along with husband Andrew Upton.

'When you grow up admiring someone and then have the chance to work with them, even if it is only playing dress ups for a shoot, it's perplexing,' she said.

'Cate is clearly a stunning woman and so talented but she is also such a style icon with a natural sophistication it was - in a lovely way - slightly intimidating.

'I hadn't met Andrew prior to that shoot and was blown away at his ease and comic charm - the power couple!'

Ms Hunt, who originally aspired to be a broadcast journalist but left university when she was offered a job as a beauty editor at Vogue in 2000, considers herself very lucky.

'I didn't think I would end up being somewhat of a celebrity stylist but I'm very grateful,' she said.

'There's a lot of unglamorous parts and it does give you the real insight that celebrities are as normal as anyone. It's just a job.'

Now that she has her 16-month-old son, Ms Hunt 'frivolous' spending days are over and opts for classic black, white and grey colours.

'I'm also big on comfort and I love wearing jeans, a T-shirt with a cashmere jumper and a beautiful handbag,' she said.

While Ms Hunt plans to continue her future in styling, she also hopes to get back to writing and journalism.

And her main styling tip: 'Don't try and be something or someone you're not.'

'I think looking good in what you wear comes from feeling confident and comfortable so it should fit well, suit you and your lifestyle,' she said.

'It's like seeing pregnant women or new mums trot around in sky-scraper heels, maybe with the exception of Victoria Beckham who somehow pulls it off. It's dangerous and so impractical. Or wearing a micro-mini in the middle of winter out to a bar - it's bad for your health and looks the opposite of sexy.

'There's nothing wrong with trying new looks or having fun with fashion but stay true to yourself about what works.'
