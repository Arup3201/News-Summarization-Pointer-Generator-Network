Charged: 83-year-old Rolf Harris is the biggest name to face trial as a result of Scotland Yard's Operation Yewtree

Rolf Harris maintained his nine-month long silence over sex allegations yesterday as he was charged with indecently assaulting two under-age girls in the 1980s.

The 83-year-old entertainer did not comment publicly after Operation Yewtree detectives also charged him with downloading four indecent images of children last year.

The married father-of-one is the highest profile celebrity to be charged as a result of the Yewtree probe, which was set up in the aftermath of the Jimmy Savile scandal.

But he has not issued a formal statement on the allegations since he was first quizzed by police last November.

There was no sign of Harris – a favourite of the Queen – at his riverside home in Berkshire yesterday and no mention of the developments on his website. His lawyer and publicist did not return messages requesting a statement.

Harris is charged with six counts of indecently assaulting a girl aged between 15 and 16, from 1980 to 1981. Each offence carries a maximum two-year sentence.

He is further charged with three offences of indecently assaulting a girl aged 14, in 1986. As a result of a law change, which increased the punishment for offences committed after 1985, the maximum jail term is ten years.

The TV presenter and acclaimed artist is also charged with four offences of making indecent images of a child between March and July 2012. The offence carries a maximum ten-year sentence.

After spending nine months investigating the allegations against Harris, including making well-documented background inquiries in Australia, Scotland Yard passed a file on the case to the Crown Prosecution Service on August 12.

Media interest: Press outside the home of Rolf Harris in Bray, Berkshire, today, after the CPS announced the charges against him

Alison Saunders, chief prosecutor for 
CPS London, said: ‘Having completed our review [of the evidence], we 
have concluded that there is sufficient evidence and it is in the public
 interest for Mr Harris to be charged with nine counts of indecent 
assault and four of making indecent images of a child.’ Harris will 
appear at Westminster Magistrates’ Court on September 23.

In public: Harris was interviewed under caution on November 29 last year after his house was searched, and has been rarely seen since - shown here in January

The
 entertainer was interviewed under caution by detectives on November 29 
last year, five days after a search warrant was executed at his home in 
Bray near Maidenhead. He was formally arrested over the allegations on 
March 28 but although he was widely named on Twitter as being a Yewtree 
suspect, he was not identified by the mainstream media until April.

Yewtree
 has been run in three strands – claims involving Savile, those 
involving Savile and others, and those involving others. Harris is being
 dealt with under the ‘others’ strand, meaning the allegations have no 
link to Savile.

The 
Australian, who painted a portrait of the Queen in 2005 and performed at
 her Diamond Jubilee concert last year, has been a family favourite for 
decades. He had his first musical hit Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport in 
1960, and continued to enjoy success in the industry, gaining cult 
status in recent years and performing at Glastonbury festival several 
times.

He also proved 
popular as a television presenter, getting his first big break in 1967 
when he began hosting his own BBC1 programme, The Rolf Harris Show, 
before moving on to children’s television in the 1980s and then to 
Animal Hospital, which he hosted from 1994 to 2004.

Honour: Rolf Harris painted the Queen to celebrate her 80th birthday in 2006, and is known to be well-liked by Her Majesty

Harris,
 who has lived in Bray for more than 50 years, was awarded an MBE in 
1968, an OBE in 1977 and a CBE in 2006, and was made Officer of the 
Order of Australia in the Queen’s Birthday Honours list last year.

At
 last summer’s Diamond Jubilee concert at Buckingham Palace, Harris 
famously led the crowd in an impromptu rendition of Two Little Boys, his
 1969 Christmas No 1 hit.

Harris’s wife is the Welsh sculptress and jeweller Alwen Hughes.

They met while they were both art students, marrying in 1958. They have one daughter, Bindi, a painter, now aged 49.

His
 friends were in shock after he was charged yesterday. Veteran singer 
Vince Hill, who has known the Australian celebrity for more than 50 
years, said: ‘I can’t find words to describe my shock and disbelief. 
This just isn’t the Rolf I know.’

Hill,
 82, admitted his biggest worry was for the star’s ailing wife Alwen. 
‘She’s crippled with  arthritis, suffers problems with her hips and 
knees and is in her 80s,’  he said.
