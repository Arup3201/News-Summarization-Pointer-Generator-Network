'Suspicious' behaviour: A police profile of a suspect in Madeleine McCann's disappearance had a violent past, reported a Portuguese newspaper

A police profile drawn up of a new Madeleine McCann suspect has exposed his violent past and ‘suspicious behaviour with children,’ it was claimed today.

Leading Portuguese daily Correio da Manha said the profile had heightened police suspicions about a dead immigrant thief said to have been put in the frame over the youngster's disappearance.

The Portuguese paper has identified an ex worker at the Ocean Club, the Algarve holiday club where Madeleine disappeared from, as the man police believe may have kidnapped her in an act of revenge against his former employer.

Detectives are investigating the possibility he killed her after seeing the huge backlash the crime generated, reports say.

The father-of-one, who emigrated to Portugal from his native Cape Verde off west Africa, was convicted of theft in 1996 and told he was being sent home as punishment.

Portugal's then President Jorge Sampaio let him stay after granting him a pardon but he died aged 40 in a tractor accident in 2009.

He is reported to have been sacked from the Ocean Club before Madeleine disappeared on May 3 in 2007.

Portuguese detectives are investigating Madeleine McCann's disappearance again following a decision last month by the country's Attorney General to reopen the case, more than five years after it was shelved.

Correio da Manha claimed today: 
‘Portuguese police inspectors, who studied the case and asked for its 
recent reopening, put together a profile of the suspect who died aged 40
 in 2009, and concluded the character traits they identified 
strengthened the possibility he could have been the author of the 
crime.’

The paper said the 
man, who it has not named, had a past ‘marked by some episodes of 
violence’ and had ‘suspicious behaviour with children’ but offered no 
more details of their claims.

Motive: The man was reportedly a former employee of the Ocean Club (pictured) where Madeleine disappeared in May 2007. Police believe he may have kidnapped her in an act of revenge against his former employer

It also insisted the man's family had refused to help police who are now trying to identify locations where Madeline's body could be buried.

Portuguese police have made no official comment on the reports although a highly-placed source has denied detectives are searching for Madeleine's body.

The family of the latest suspect, who has been named in the UK press, are threatening to sue the Portuguese state over the leaks and are insisting he is innocent.

His brother-in-law spoke out to defend him and insisted Portuguese police had not been in contact.

Speaking outside his country home at the end of a dirt track a short drive from Praia da Luz where Madeleine disappeared, he said: ‘We do not know what the police think because they haven't been in touch.

‘He has a mother and father and a brother and detectives may have contacted them but I do not know if that is the case.

‘It was a shock to us all when we read the police suspected my late brother-in-law of kidnapping and killing Madeleine.

‘He wasn't named in the newspaper reports but we knew immediately who they were talking about.

New leads: The investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine, pictured, was reopened following a review of the case

Hope: The McCann's lawyer said that the couple, seen here with a computer generated image of how Madeleine might have looked in 2012, are still motivated by the belief that she is still alive

‘My sister does not want to speak about it. She has a young child she is trying to protect and she is obviously worried about the effect on him if it gets talked about at school.

‘My brother-in-law was sacked from the Ocean Club and I can understand why the police would want to have a look at him, especially if they then discover he has a criminal conviction. But I strongly believe that if the police do consider he is a suspect in the Madeleine McCann case, they are looking at the wrong man.

‘The idea he did it to get revenge on the Ocean Club makes no sense at all. It wasn't as if what happened there with him losing his job destroyed his life.

‘He got work elsewhere soon after. He 
was working at the time he died. He is not around to defend his 
reputation so others have to do it for him. Our concern is making sure 
this doesn't get any bigger.

‘The police will do what they have to do but we don't want to say any more about it.’

A
 police source told weekly Portuguese newspaper 'O Crime' today that the
 theory of the ex-Ocean Club worker's involvement in Madeleine's 
disappearance was ‘worthy of note’.

Looking for graves: One source claimed that police are now searching for possible locations where Madeline's body could be buried

But insisting nothing had been discounted, he added: ‘All leads, including those the British least like, are being considered.

The McCanns' Portuguese lawyer Rogerio Alves insisted last month Gerry and Kate McCann had been told the new lines of inquiry being probed by Portuguese police discounted them as suspects.

Portuguese police have made no official comment.

The couple, from Rothley, Leicestershire, were made suspects after Madeleine disappeared but had their status as ‘arguidos’ removed before the case was shelved.

They are now expected to apply to become ‘assistantes’ - or private prosecutors - in the case so they can assist state prosecutors coordinating the reopened investigation.
