Bayern Munich remain unbeaten at the top of the Bundesliga after cruising past Hoffenheim 4-0 at the Allianz Arena.

Pep Guardiola's side did the damage in the first-half with goals from summer acquisitions Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski however keeper Manuel Neuer nearly threw away that lead, attempting a Cruyff turn infront of goal but luckily for him he managed to clear just in time.

Bayern were rarely troubled and looked in supreme form as Arjen Robben and Sebastian Rode added a late double.

Gotze became the first player to reach seven Bundesliga goals this season with a spectacular 30-yard strike into the top corner after 23 minutes.

The hosts were in control and striker Robert Lewandowski doubled Bayern's lead with his seventh goal of the season, heading in  Robben's cross unmarked at the back post, just before the break.

Bastian Schweinsteiger replaced Gotze in the second-half for his first appearance since lifting the World Cup with Germany in July.

Robben then scored a typical finish in the final ten minutes, playing a one-two with Lewandowski before casually lifting the ball over Baumann to secure the win and Rode completed the scoring after a clever through-ball from Schweinsteiger.

The performance won't please Manuel Pellegrini, as his Manchester City side host the red hot German giants in the Champions League on Tuesday.
