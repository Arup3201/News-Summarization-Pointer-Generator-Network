Strong words: President Obama used his State of the Union speech in Washington last night to send a message to Iran that the U.S. would keep up the pressure on its disputed nuclear program

President Obama used his State of the Union speech last night to ramp up pressure on Iran after Europe sent battleships to the Gulf.

The U.S. President warned Iran that America would focus on its disputed nuclear program with 'no options off the table' but said the door remained open to talks for a peaceful resolution.

The President's comments came as European nations sent an international flotilla of 
warships, led by U.S. carriers, through the sensitive Strait of Hormuz on Sunday as a 'clear 
signal' to Tehran.

Iran has threatened to close the strait - through which 35 per cent of the world's tanker-borne oil exports pass - in retaliation for sanctions against its oil exports.

In Washington last night, Obama told Congress that Tehran was isolated and facing 'crippling' sanctions that he said would continue so long as the country kept its back turned to the international community.

He said: 'America is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will take no options off the table to achieve that goal.

'But a peaceful resolution of this issue is still possible, and far better, and if Iran changes course and meets its obligations, it can rejoin the community of nations.'

When he came to office in 2009, Obama broke with his Republican predecessor George W Bush and offered an olive branch to Iran, saying he wanted a new beginning with the country that Bush had labeled part of the 'axis of evil'.

However tensions have escalated over the Iranian nuclear program that Tehran claims is for energy purposes and the West fears is to build a nuclear weapon.

In the State of the Union address, which focused mainly on the U.S. economy, Obama also said he was sure that Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad 'will soon discover that the forces of change can't be reversed' and said the U.S. would stand against violence and intimidation in the Middle East and beyond.

He also sought to assuage concerns among Jewish voters in the United States about his stance on Israel.

'Our iron-clad commitment - and I mean iron-clad - to Israel's security has meant the closest military cooperation between our two countries in history,' the President said.

Iran's nuclear program is a major concern for Israel, which has not ruled out a unilateral strike on Iran's nuclear sites.

The strong words from President Obama followed a rare joint yesterday where German chancellor Angela Merkel, French president Nicolas Sarkozy and British prime minister David Cameron warned Tehran it would face economic isolation unless it abandoned its nuclear ambitions 'immediately'.

They added: 'We have no quarrel with 
the Iranian people. But the Iranian leadership has failed to restore 
international confidence in the exclusively peaceful nature of its 
nuclear programme. We will not accept Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon.'

The statement, which concluded a day 
of intense activity, was backed up by an 'unprecedented' package of EU 
sanctions, designed to suck the lifeblood from the regime – including the 
ban on importing Iranian oil into Europe.

Tehran responded with defiance, with 
elements of the ruling regime warning it would shut the strategically 
critical Strait of Hormuz – a move that would effectively close the Gulf
 to shipping and send oil prices rocketing.

The United States has warned Tehran 
that closing the Strait, which carries one-fifth of the world's oil 
exports, would trigger a massive military response from the West. The 
message was underlined at the weekend when Britain, the U.S. and France 
sent six warships through the Strait.

Mr Cameron said the UK 'will not accept' Iran's bid to develop a nuclear weapon while the country's defence secretary Philip Hammond warned that reinforcements will be available if needed.

Mr Hammond was speaking at a press 
conference in London following the annual round of talks between UK and 
Australian foreign and defence ministers. Australia's foreign minister 
Kevin Rudd said his country would enforce the same ban on Iranian crude 
oil exports agreed by the European Union yesterday.

Between them, EU member states import 
almost 600,000 barrels a day of Iran's crude oil exports – more than a 
fifth of the total. A 
ban on exports of gold, precious metals and diamonds from Iran has also 
been imposed, along with more economic and travel bans on members of the
 hardline regime.

Leading figures 
in Tehran responded 
furiously. Mohammad Kossari, deputy head of the Iranian parliament's 
foreign affairs and security committee, said: 'If any disruption happens
 regarding the sale of Iranian oil, the Strait of  Hormuz will 
definitely be closed.'

Senior politician Heshmatollah 
Falahatpisheh added: 'In case of threat, the closure of the Strait of 
Hormuz is one of Iran's rights.'

Sources believe full closure 
of the Strait remains unlikely because it would bring 'huge negative 
consequences' for Tehran. But they fear Iran could engage in months of 
threats and disruption which would ramp up oil prices in the West 
without sparking a full military reprisal against Iran.

A U.S.-led carrier group passed through the 
strait, which is 21 miles wide at its narrowest point. The USS Admiral 
Lincoln, an aircraft carrier with a fleet of 90 planes, headed the 
group. It was escorted by British ship HMS Argyll, a guided missile cruiser and two 
destroyers from the U.S. Navy and a French warship.

Threats: Iran has stepped up threats to close the strategic Strait of Hormuz, through which a fifth of the world's crude oil flows, in retaliation for facing sanctions

Insiders said it was unusual for a 
flotilla made up of ships from three separate navies to pass within a 
few miles of the Iranian coastline.

A defence source rejected suggestions 
that it was a provocative move intended to increase pressure on Iran, 
adding: 'It is a statement that makes abundantly clear that these are 
international waters and all countries need to respect that. This shows 
that we are working in partnership and solidarity.'

Professor Paul Stevens, a senior 
research fellow at the think-tank Chatham House, said he doubted Tehran 
would carry out its threat to blockade the strait, for fear of sparking a
 'shooting war' with the U.S. Instead, he said, an oil blockade would 
encourage hardliners in Iran to launch a wave of terror attacks.

Professor Stevens said an oil blockade
 was unlikely to succeed, because Tehran could ship its oil, which makes
 up 50 per cent of its revenues, through pipelines to Turkey and Egypt.
 He added: 'History is littered with failed oil embargoes. However, the
 lessons of history appear to have passed by the decision makers of the 
EU.'
