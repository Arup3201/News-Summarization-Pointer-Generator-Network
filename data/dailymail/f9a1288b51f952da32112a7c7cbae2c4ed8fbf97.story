What do you say to an AC Milan fan after his idols have won the Champions League final? 'Switch off the PlayStation, you've got work in the morning.' The gag may be naff, but illustrates their decline succinctly, even if they are restoring pride under new coach Pippo Inzaghi.

The Rossoneri are not in Europe this season. Not even the Europa League. Rival supporters in Italy find it hilarious, but many outside the peninsular consider UEFA competitions incomplete without the seven-times European champions. British football fans over 25 hold fond memories of them thanks to Channel 4.

When calcio viewership was at its UK peak in the early-to-mid-Nineties, Milan ruled, winning won four league titles between 1991-92 and 1995-96. Ruud Gullit, Frank Rijkaard, Zvonimir Boban, Franco Baresi and Paolo Maldini? Yes please.

Since the turn of the century they have had entertaining tussles with Manchester United, Leeds, Celtic and Chelsea. And a couple of big nights with Liverpool. Then the slide.

Two incidents reveal everything. In October 1999 Chelsea's travelling support were elated with a 1-1 draw against Milan at the San Siro in the Champions League. 

A decade and a half later, promising Blues reserve Marco van Ginkel needed persuading to join the Italians on loan. What caused such a monumental tumble?

Cost Cutters

Cash played a part in the downsizing of this giant, though not to the extent often reported. Fininvest, Milan's parent company, founded by club president Silvio Berlusconi, suffered losses earlier this decade.

In the most remarkable clear-out in recent memory, the Rossoneri sold or released a slew of high earners in 2012-13's transfer windows. World Cup 2006 heroes Alessandro Nesta,  Inzaghi, Gianluca Zambrotta, Massimo Oddo and Gennaro Gattuso moved on.

Champions League winners Seedorf and Mark van Bommel left, crown jewels Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Thiago Silva flew to PSG, enraging fans in the process. Devilish forward Antonio Cassano concluded the summer exodus and popular but fragile Brazil striker Pato departed in January 2013.

Massimiliano Allegri was tasked with leading Milan through a difficult financial period

Allegri, an understated, co-operative man, led an Ibra-inspired team to the 2011 championship. Two years later he guided his men to third place, despite the evacuation of talent. He never moaned. But the declining Rossoneri were less of a draw for fans in the stadium and on the sofa.

In January 2014 a Milan XI of bargain bucket players, prospects, misfits and veterans lost 4-3 to Sassuolo in the league. Allegri, suffocating in the toxic gloom, was dismissed. Spirits and performances were at their lowest since the club's humiliating relegation from Serie A in 1982.

But budget cutting isn't the full story. Finance expert Andrea Bricchi covers economics for the website 'PianetaMilan' (Milan Planet). 'Berlusconi is still Italy's richest man. He could still spend €300m a year on transfers, but his political advisers forbid it. In this era of austerity it would look frivolous and wasteful,' says Bricchi.

Berlusconi's inner circle is attuned to the political power of football. 'His aides advise him to splash out during electoral campaigns. Milan bought Ibrahimovic, Robinho and Mario Balotelli before recent elections. But they won't let Berlusconi sell the team or spend heavily too often. Both would lose public favour and votes,' adds Bricchi.

The Lombardy club are marketing pacesetters in calcio. Their flashy, multilingual website (ACMilan.com) and glossy club promotions are everything you'd expect from a team owned by Berlusconi - a master communicator who made his fortune from television.

But merchandising revenue in Italian football is low compared with La Liga and the Premier League. Although they have won only three fewer European Cups/Champions Leagues than Real Madrid, Milan's shirt sales are miles behind the aristocratic Spaniards' figures.

Richard Smith of leading kit sellers Subsidesports.com says: 'There's a correlation in results, players and sales. Mario Balotelli and Stephan El Shaarawy jerseys sold well last season, but like most Italian teams, Milan are a tenth of where they were commercially in the 90s or early 00s.'

Rossoneri Revival

The frugal life, forced or not, has made club directors resourceful. This summer's transfer activity was extraordinary for such a prestigious team. Milan's net expenditure was -£13.2m. The sale of Balotelli to Liverpool was the largest event.

The club broke the transfer world record twice in the summer of 1992, when they bought Jean-Pierre Papin then Gianluigi Lentini. Now they are leaders in employing out of contract or unwanted stars.

Several players expected to be protagonists this season cost nothing. They include mercurial winger Jeremy Menez, Japanese icon Keisuke Honda, former Real Madrid goalkeeper Diego Lopez and unpredictable but committed midfielder Sulley Muntari.

Mario Balotelli was the latest star to leave Milan this summer, joining Liverpool for just £16m

But Fernando Torres has started well at the San Siro, scoring on his full debut against Empoli on Tuesday

Then there's hulking ex-Chelsea centre back Alex, club captain Riccardo Montolivo and Fernando Torres, who headed his first goal in Italy away to Empoli on Tuesday night. These players, not to mention wobbly defender Philippe Mexes and Michael Essien, cost less than a ticket to the city's famous opera house La Scala.

Supporters aren't rejoicing that their team is scrounging and scrabbling around for players. But it's difficult not to admire such creative, canny dealing. And don't assume that freebies are a new concept at the San Siro.

Michael Reizeger, Edgar Davids, Cafu, Jon Dahl Tomasson, Rivaldo and Mark van Bommel arrived for nothing in the past. But the volume of zero cost re-enforcements has never been this high.

Value for money includes the dugout. The last three coaches, Allegri, Seedorf and current boss Inzaghi, have been inexpensive. For all their qualities, they won't trouble 'world's 20 best paid managers' lists.

Is the quest for success via financial sustainability bad for the image of the former glamour boys of calcio? Stefano Cantalupi of Gazzetta dello Sport says: 'Recruiting cheap options runs the risk of damaging the brand globally. But they are clever to hire coaches like Seedorf and Inzaghi who won the Champions League with the club in recent years. The link to the "glory days" remains.'

Match day revenue is equally problematic. The club are synonymous with the world famous San Siro, which resembles a futuristic car park. But they don't own the ground and can't generate the money they'd like. They want their own home with official merchandise outlets, restaurants and better facilities for fans.

The plan is to leave the San Siro in the next three years. CEO Barbara Berlusconi said: 'Our own stadium would allow us to compete with Europe's more economically powerful clubs. It's a priority.'

So Far, So Good

Fans don't obsess over spreadsheets. What happens on the pitch counts. The new look, low cost Milan and their young leader Inzaghi started well. They were slick and hungry in their opening day 3-1 victory over Lazio and impressed (in attack) in their next outing, a 5-4 win at Parma.

A cautious, passive defeat at home by champions Juventus on Saturday showed how much work is required. In their latest match, a midweek trip to Empoli, the defence looked panicky. But the way they fought back from 2-0 after twenty one minutes to draw 2-2 showed character.

The enthusiasm remains. On a good day, Inzaghi's side play bold, fast football, moving the ball quickly and taking a maximum of two touches. Snappy, short passes to feet and a low line to leave space for the forwards to zoom into.

AC Milan's new era isn't the most expensive, but they are sure to entertain in Serie A this season

Massimo Callegari presents live Serie A games on Mediaset, and spoke to Inzaghi after Milan's opening win over Lazio. 'The message from Inzaghi is that they'll tolerate the occasional defeat if the other team are clearly better than them. But it's unacceptable if Milan fail because they show less hunger and dedication than the other side. He is creating a strong, close-knit group,' says Callegari.

The recent past is ugly, the distant past a permanent reminder of the Rossoneri's decline. This motivated, united squad and their energetic coach are worth watching though.

The 13-time Scudetto winners, free of European commitments, shouldn't be underestimated. If they keep up the high-scoring (10 goals scored, eight conceded in four league games) fans won't need PlayStations for entertainment.
