From the gargoyles at the gates to the cobwebs in the kitchen one horror-loving couple have blown more than £225,000 building an exact replica of the house from hit 1960s TV series The Munsters.

The house is a fully furnished 6,000 sq ft homage to the classic sitcom attracting thousands of TV buffs each year.

Sandra Mckee and her husband Charles from Waxahachie, Texas, U.S. decided to create the mansion after a lifelong love for the show.

Mrs Mckee said: 'I grew up with it and The Munsters was one of the shows you could watch with the family - a real wholesome family show.

'We had restored an old Victorian house before and I just said it would be really cool to create the Munster house.

'I was just joking to begin with but when Chuck said that would be really cool I just ran with it and here we are.'

The mansion includes some of the most iconic Munsters features such as Grandpa Munster's dungeon, rotating suit of armour and of course the pet dinosaur under the stairs.

But this house is not just for show - the Mckees live in their creepy surroundings all year round.

Mrs Mckee, 56, said she feels like she has to match the show in every sense but it does have its downside.

She said: 'I think we do miss out on a lot of comfort areas in the house.

'It would sometimes be nice to go into your bedroom and have a regular room.

'We had a king-size bed but as this didn't match the show we had to downsize it for a smaller one.

'The thing is we have to match the show. When people come in they look for things to catch you out on, things that don't match the show.'

Every piece of furniture in the mansion is specifically chosen for its resemblance to pieces in the show - no matter what the cost.

Mr Mckee said: 'Some items in the house have come from the set, been found on auction sites or have kindly been donated by people.

'The most expensive item was Lily's harp which she plays in the show - that cost $25,000.

'I always look for bargains on eBay and after ten years of searching found the organ that Grandpa Munster plays - it only cost $700.'

The couple spent £225,000 on the initial build but since then Sandra has lost track of how much she has spent kitting out the house.

The Munster-mad Grandma also doesn't see her obsession ending any time soon.

Mrs Mckee said: 'I will always be looking for new pieces to add to the house.

'If we had enough money I'd create a whole street with the Addams Family house and the one from Psycho.

'I did the Munster Mansion for my own pleasure and didn't even think that people would care - especially enough to come and visit from other countries.'

Every year around Halloween the couple hold a charity event at the house where people can dress up which raises money for their neighbourhood. 

Almost 1,000 people attend and the chosen charity this year is the Salvation Army.

The house definitely impacts their family life with three children and eight grandchildren who can enjoy it with them.

Mrs Mckee said: 'My youngest grandson - now eight - thought for a long time we were the actual Munsters and was a bit scared of the house.'

This Halloween the couple have said they will enjoy trick or treating with their grandchildren and also handing out treats to those who are brave enough to venture up their garden path.
