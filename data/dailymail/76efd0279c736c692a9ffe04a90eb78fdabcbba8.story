A Chinese woman stands on a subway platform, her underwear all too apparent thanks to the see-through dress she has chosen to wear.

But the image, part of a campaign by Shanghai Metro to tackle sexual harassment on their trains, has led to cries of discrimination and sexism by angry feminists.

Posted on the metro operator's microblogging Weibo account, it urges ladies to pay attention to how they dress - adding that there are many perverts on the subway, so they have to show some 'self-respect'.

An advert featuring a Chinese woman wearing a see-through dress, to highlight the dangers of dressing provocatively on the Shanghai Metro, has led to a backlash by angry feminists

The post, published by Shanghai No. 2 Subway Co. prompted replies such as, 'It's no wonder that some people get harassed if they dress like this.'

Now, however, there has been a backlash, with women outraged by the suggestion that they are to blame for sexual harassment by dressing provocatively.

'According to this logic, all men can harass women in swimming pools,' the China Daily quoted a Weibo user as saying.

Another user said: 'Even if a woman doesn't wear revealing clothes, it doesn't mean she won't be sexually harassed.'

Two feminists took up the cause by covering their faces with veils and holding signs which read: 'We want coolness, not perverts' and 'I can be coquettish, but you can't harass me'

The performance artists took their demo onto the trains as well

The protesters drew a crowd - but according to a survey conducted by Sina Weibo, thousands of web users agreed that women should keep their dress code conservative while on public transport

Two feminists took up the cause this week by covering their faces with veils and holding signs which read: 'We want coolness, not perverts' and 'I can be coquettish, but you can’t harass me.'

A spokesman for the metro company denied allegations that the post  justified sexual harassment, adding that it was intended as a 'kind reminder' to women, according to ANI news agency.

'As the city's subway operator, we 
have the responsibility to warn women of the potential danger of sexual 
harassment on the subway,' he told the Global Times newspaper.

He added that there had been a rise in the number of complaints from women harassed on the subway.

According to a survey conducted by Sina Weibo, thousands of web users agreed that women should keep their dress code conservative while on public transport, he said.

More subway wolf... girl, please behave! How the message got lost in translation

For those not fluent in Chinese script, a rather confusing translation of the ad has also appeared on the web.

Run through Google Translate, it reads:

'Subway, dressed like that, and not be harassed, strange.

'More subway wolf, playing numerous fight the war of crying wolf, girl, please behave!'

How the ad appears via Google Translate

A better translation was provided by the South China Morning Post:

'Dressing like that, it would be unusual for a lady not be harassed.

'There can be perverts on the subway and it's hard to get rid of them. Please have self-respect, ladies.'

The post has since gone viral, with more than 6,000 comments and 1,500 reblogs.
