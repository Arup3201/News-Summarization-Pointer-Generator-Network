A leisurely trip to a tennis club turned to tragedy when an elderly woman was run over by her own car on Wednesday morning.

The 79-year-old was reversing out of her local Aberdare Road club, in the NSW Hunter Region, at about 10.15am when the accident happened.

Central Hunter duty officer Chief Inspector Lindsell said she was trying to perform a reversing U-turn in the club's driveway, the Maitland Mercury reports.

Accident: An elderly woman has been killed after being run over by her own car in the NSW Hunter Region. She was pronounced dead at nearby Cessnock hospital.

Her vehicle suddenly accelerated and drove onto an unused bowling green while she attempted to perform the manoeuvre.

She exited the vehicle when it mounted a gutter, stepping out to take a look at what had happened.

However, the shocked driver was then run over by the car's front wheel after she accidentally pressed the accelerator.
