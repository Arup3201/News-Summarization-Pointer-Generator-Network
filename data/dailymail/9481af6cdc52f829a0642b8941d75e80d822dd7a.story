The contents of a Boston time capsule dating to 1901 has been revealed with the box containing letters, photographs, newspaper clippings and the book 'Foreign Relations of the United States, 1896.'

The capsule was removed last week from the head of lion statue that has long stood guard over the Old State House. 

The Bostonian Society, which oversees the historic building, released an inventory of the items Wednesday.

Items are stacked inside a shoebox-sized 1901 time capsule in Boston. The capsule contained letters, photographs, newspaper clippings and the book Foreign Relations of the United States, 1986

A piece of wood with the hand written description: 'Wood removed from the Old Lion age of same 21 years in 1900' is displayed after it was taken from a 1901 time capsule in Boston

The presence of a red hardcover book, with no visible title, surprised the organization because it had not been included on a list discovered by an ancestor of a man who worked on the statue, nor was it referenced in a recently-uncovered 1901 newspaper article about the time capsule.

When the book was later opened, it revealed the title 'Foreign Relations of the United States,' followed by the subtitle, 'The Annual Message of the President of the United States,' and transmitted to Congress on Dec. 7, 1896. Grover Cleveland would have been president on that date.

Heather Leet, the society's spokeswoman told the Boston Globe that the book was probably just put in to use up space.

Portrait photographs of city and state elected officials are displayed  - among those depicted are Boston Mayor Thomas Norton Hart, top left, and Massachusetts Gov. Winthrop Murray Craine, bottom right, who both held office at the time

'Basically, the secretary of state would publish the book annually.'

Elizabeth Roscio, archivist for the Bostonian Society, judged the materials that were tightly packed into the box to be in remarkably good overall condition, which she credited to the capsule being tightly sealed to prevent any deterioration or water damage.

Some details will apparently remain under wraps a bit longer, however, including the contents of a letter that was sealed into a plain brown envelope that read: 'A Message to Posterity from the daily newspapers at City Hall.'

The letter is believed to be a missive to future generations written by a group of Boston journalists. 

It was not immediately clear when it might be opened.

Among the political campaign buttons listed on the inventory was a William McKinley-Theodore Roosevelt campaign button.

Rumors: The society, which manages the Old State House, first learned about the possible existence of the time capsule years ago from the great-great-granddaughter of Samuel Rogers, a craftsman who had worked on building renovations and was believed to have placed the time capsule in the lion's head

A peek at the goods: The men opened the box, which historians said likely contained documents from circa 1901 

Red book: Inside was a red book. The experts on hand declined to even inspect it, citing its fragile condition

McKinley, who won a second term as president in 1900, would be assassinated only months after the time capsule was placed in the lion's head, with Roosevelt, then vice president, succeeding him.

Other items in the box included photographs and business cards of local elected and appointed officials along two nails, one from the Old State House and one from another historic Boston building, the Old South Church.

The Old State House, the first seat of Massachusetts state government, was an administrative building in colonial times and a focal point of patriotic fervor. British soldiers gunned down five protesters outside the building in 1770, an event that became known as the Boston Massacre.  

 One of Boston's most popular tourist attractions, the Old State House has a storied history.

No crown jewel: The lion statue was placed atop Boston's Old State House in 1901 and the shoebox-sized metal box placed inside and promptly forgotten

It was once the seat of English rule in the northern colonies, and the original lion statue and an accompanying unicorn statue symbolized the unification of England and Scotland.

It was just outside the building that British regulars opened fire on a crowd of protesters in 1770, killing five people in what would become known as the Boston Massacre.

In the summer of 1776, the newly-signed Declaration of Independence was read for the first time to Bostonians from a balcony of the building, which would later serve as the first seat of Massachusetts government.

The plan is to put a new time capsule in the lion's head, this one made of titanium. 

The society is currently soliciting suggestions of what to put in it, but said one item will be a medal from the ill-fated 2013 Boston Marathon.

Bostonians have whispered about the existence of a time capsule inside the head of the lion statue placed atop the city's Old State House for years. 

The rumors began when a woman purporting to be the descendant of the statue's sculptor came forward, but the denizens of the Massachusetts town have had to wait until now to know for sure.

A 1901 article in the Boston Globe reported on the original placement of the statue, as well as the box inside that has nbw been found:

The work of the coppersmith is completed, and one of the last things he did was to seal a copper box, which is placed in the head of the lion, and which contains contributions from state and city officials, the Boston daily newspapers, the name of the maker of the lion and unicorn, and others, which will prove interesting when the box is opened many years hence.B
