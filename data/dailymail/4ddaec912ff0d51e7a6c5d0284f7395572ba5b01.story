Pellets: Jack Hewitt, from Edinburgh, who yesterday pleaded guilty to a charge of culpably and recklessly  discharging a firearm on May 30

A teenager who shot and injured primary school children with an air weapon was ‘just letting off steam’, a court has been told.

Jack Hewitt, 17, opened fire with a BB gun from a window at his parents’ home, hitting several youngsters enjoying their lunchtime break in the playground.

One child was struck on the forehead and another just below the eye by the plastic pellets. The youngsters at Gilmerton Primary, Edinburgh, suffered red marks and bruising, although none was seriously injured.

Hewitt yesterday pleaded guilty to a charge of culpably and recklessly  discharging a firearm on May 30.

Depute fiscal Susan Dickson told Edinburgh Sheriff Court: ‘The children were out playing on their lunchtime break when a number of them reported being hit by what they thought were stones. Later, white plastic ball bearings were found and it became clear that they had been hit by pellets.’

Miss Dickson said that when police called at Hewitt’s home he appeared to be ‘tearful’ and told officers that he had shot the BB gun but said he did not mean to hit anyone.

‘He said he had shot from the bathroom window but was unable to explain why he had done something so stupid,’ Miss Dickson said.

Hewitt was taken to the city’s St Leonard’s police station for questioning.

Miss Dickson told the court Hewitt had said: ‘That was me. I was just letting off some steam. I’ll never do it again.’ She added: ‘He said that he was sitting higher exams at the time and that the stress had got to him.’

Hewitt’s solicitor handed a letter from Hewitt’s school principal to Sheriff Isabella McColl but it was  not read to the court. The case was adjourned to January 21 for social inquiry reports.

Police Scotland confirmed that the weapon used was a BB gun, which was seized by them. The force is now awaiting a destruction order from the court.

Chief Inspector Mark Patterson, local commander for Police Scotland covering the south of Edinburgh, said: ‘This was a reckless act against young children, which had the potential to cause serious injury.

‘This incident caused a lot of concern in the school and local community and I am pleased that we were able to arrest this young man quickly in order to keep people safe.’

Scottish Conservative chief whip John Lamont said: ‘The public will hope this disgraceful and extraordinarily dangerous act is met with a tough sentence. Pathetic excuses like he was “blowing off steam” should be completely dismissed.’

The debate over the control of air weapons has raged since the death of a two-year-old Glasgow boy in 2005 after he was shot in the head with an air rifle. Drug addict Mark Bonini was given a life sentence for the murder.

Last December, the SNP unveiled plans to force owners of Scotland’s estimated 500,000 airguns to apply for a licence or hand in the weapons in a bid to cut the number of offences relating to their use.
