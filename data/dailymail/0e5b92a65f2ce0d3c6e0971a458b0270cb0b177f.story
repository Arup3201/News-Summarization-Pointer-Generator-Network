A father has stabbed his three-year-old daughter to death before hanging himself in an apparent murder-suicide.

Robert Bzdek, 34, attacked daughter Zuzanna on Friday afternoon at their home in Woodridge, Illinois, before going to his bedroom and hanging himself.

Bzdek's stepson, Emanuel Szyszka, discovered the gruesome scene on when he came home to collect sports kit for gymnastic practice.

Tragic: Zuzanna Bzdek, 3, was stabbed to death by 34-year-old father Robert in their home. His teenage stepson Emanuel Szyszka (right) discovered the scene on Friday afternoon

The teenager said he discovered bloody footprints at the door of his home and called out to Bzdek, who said he had cut his foot on broken glass.

When Emanuel went inside he discovered the door to the master bedroom had been barricaded shut and called police. By the time officers arrived and got into the room, Bzdek had hanged himself.

Speaking to the Chicago Tribune, Emanuel said: 'I watched as they carried my limp sister out the door.'

Zuzanna, who was alive when police officers arrived, was taken to hospital but later died in surgery.

Emanuel has since set up a webpage to raise fund's for Zuzanna's funeral and burial costs.

Writing on the page, Emanuel said: 'We are trying to raise money for my deceased sister Zuzia's funeral service and wake.

'The whole family would really appreciate if each person contributed some sort of dollar amount for our cause, and to every contributor, thank you sincerely for your time and support given such an atrocity. You will always be in our hearts.'

The page surpassed its initial goal of $9,000 within hours of being posted and is now aiming for $15,000. The total currently stands at $12,020.

Emanuel added: 'The family is really thankful for all of your support and love that all of you guys have provided for us.

'We will be able to give out precious Zuzia the burial that she deserves because of you guys. I can sincerely say that I love all of you for helping us out in one of the hardest moments of our lives.

'We are getting so much support from all of you kind and wonderful people, and we are oh so pleased to have such a great community.

Emmanuel has set up a webpage to raise fund for Zuzanna's funeral, and has collected more than $12,000

'We aren't quite sure how much is needed for the funeral/wake, but all the possible funds are appreciated to cover all the expenses.

'Thank you everyone so much, you are bringing tears to my eyes at how good and kind you are in the face of such an evil and cruel act to the most wondrous sister I could have asked for.

'I know this is going to be a really tough time for all of us (extended family and friends included), but if we just keep strong and unite against this awful atrocity; we can and will make my sister proud of us all.

'All of you kind-hearted souls are making this tragedy easier for the family, so thank you again.'

NBC Chicago interviewed elderly neighbour Raymond Davis who described Zuzanna as a 'beautiful child' who used to play on the sidewalk outside his house.

He described Bzdek as a 'hardworking' father-of-three who built their home, and said he 'couldn't imagine' why he would have attacked his own daughter.

According to the Huffington Post, officials in Woodridge have not yet determined a motive but say there's no further danger to the community.

Two people have died and another 20 have been injured since Friday night in a weekend of violence in Chicago.

Micheal Flournoy, 16, died after being shot in the head on Saturday. Police found his body at 7.53pm on the 1000 block of East 93rd Street.

At 1.10pm on Saturday 24-year-old Jordan Harris was also killed after being shot in the throat at a house party in the 4300 block of West Wilcox Street, police said.

According to officers people were standing on the second-floor balcony when someone began shooting at them from an alley. When they started to run inside another shooter opened fire from the entrance to the house.

Mr Harris was taken to hospital along with five others but later died.

The spate of weekend shootings represents a sharp escalation in violence for Chicago, which saw 50 per cent fewer killings in January 2014 compared to January 2013.

While some have suggested this was because of bad weather and sub-zero temperatures, police have sought to play down the link saying that weather neither causes nor prevents crime.
