Aston Villa's Karim El Ahmadi has re-joined Feyenoord for a £750,000 fee.

The midfielder had one year left on his Villa Park contract but had fallen out of contention under manager Paul Lambert, despite making 33 appearances in all competitions last season.

El Ahmadi arrived at Villa Park in 2012 having spent four years at Feyenoord.

Indifferent: El Ahmadi's spell at Villa Park lasted just over two years

And the Moroccan international has revealed his delight at being reunited with his old club.

'I've always said I wanted to return to Feyenoord some time,' he said.

'That time has come. In my first period at this club Feyenoord was growing and that growth has continued in recent years.

'I'm really looking forward to playing in a full De Kuip again and sharing my experience with the other Feyenoord players.

'I'm also relishing teaming up again with Fred Rutten (Feyenoord boss), who was very important for me at the start of my career at FC Twente.'
