With their leather jackets,
 studded belts, tattoos and menacing looks, motorcycle gangs were seen as a dangerous influence and banned under Colonel Gaddafi.

But two and a half years after the former dictator was toppled in a bloody revolution, Biker gangs are back on the streets of Libya.

And, after a recent upsurge in road accidents, they're hoping to help keep order on the Libya's roads.

Born to be wild: Motorcycles, like many other sports or activities, were considered a threat to Libyan culture during the Gaddafi era

Lookin' for adventure:

Easy Rider Fakhri Al-Hassi, aka 'GO Fahhri', told Al Jazeera he was harassed by police during the Gaddafi era for wearing leather clothes and badges.

He said biker culture was seen by the authorities as promoting imperialist ideas.

But in February last year Mr Al-Hassi, from Al-Merej in eastern Libya, got back in the saddle and set up the Berynatchi Club.

He now organises weekly rides with other riders and maintenance workshops.

Mr Al-Hassi is hoping to improve the image of the biking culture with the Libyan people and the police.

Since
 the revolution, the number of motorcycles in the country has expanded 
greatly and with it the number of road traffic accidents.

The biker says it is important that 
the club is registered with the Libyan authorities, and that all the 
bikers who join it have a drivers' licence so that trust and respect 
develops with the Libyan authorities.

The club, which is one of the only two biker clubs in eastern Libya, now has 55 members.

For
 Mr Al-Hassi, these clubs are a good chance to show that the revolution 
was not only political, but that it affected all parts Libyan society.

Libya is still plagued by widespread 
violence and targeted killings after the civil war ousted 
Muammar Gaddafi in October 2011, with militants, militia gunmen and former rebels often 
resorting to force to impose demands on the fragile government.
