A Jewish leader has furiously accused the BBC of sensationalising a documentary about anti-Semitism in Poland.

Jonathan Ornstein, director of Jewish Community Centre of Krakow, gave an interview for the Panorama programme entitled 'Stadiums of Hate' investigating racism at the upcoming Euro 2012 venues.

Footage from the documentary showing anti-Semitic chants and racist monkey noises aimed at Black football players prompted former England captain Sol Campbell to warn fans not to travel to Poland and Ukraine otherwise 'you could end up coming back in a coffin.'

Strong words: Jonathan Ornstein, director of Jewish Community Centre of Krakow, said he was 'exploited' during the interview

The programme also showed south Asian fans being attacked at one game and crowds giving Nazi salutes at another.

But
Mr Ornstein says he was 'exploited' during the hour-long interview with
the corporation as it 'completely disregarded anything positive said 
and aired only comments critical of Poland'.

Mr
Ornstein, an American-born Jew who has lived in Poland for 11 years, 
says the images used were also selective and other contributors 
misrepresented.

He also alleges his suggestion that 
the broadcasters interviewed two Israeli footballers, who play for local
team Wisla Krakow, about their positive experiences were rejected after
being told 'it didn't fit their story'.

'I am furious at the way the BBC has exploited me as a source', he said.

Mr Ornstein says the documentary misrepresented the views of two Israeli footballers who play for local team Wisla Krakow

'The interview lasted approximately one hour during which I emphasized that the small number of football fans in Poland engaging in anti-Semitic and racist behaviour do not represent Polish society as a whole.

'The organization used me and others to manipulate the serious subject of anti-Semitism for its own sensationalist agenda; in doing so, the BBC has insulted all Polish people and done a disservice to the growing, thriving Jewish community of Poland.'

John Godson, one of Poland's two black MPs, has also criticised the documentary, which first aired on May 28 and is repeated on the BBC News Channel, in a Polish magazine.

He said: 'I believe that Poland is a 
tolerant country. Very much on this matter has changed and continues to 
change for the better.

'Poles
have ever more opportunity to come into contact with foreigners - such 
as dark-skinned people - and that is better for them. Recall that in the
[Polish General} Election 30,000 people voted for me. Do you need any 
other proof of the tolerance of Poles.'

Warning: Sol Campbell has told England fans to stay away from the European Championships

It comes as the England squad yesterday arrived at their tournament training base in Krakow, south-east Poland, ahead of their opening match against France in Ukraine on Monday.

They are having to take a two-hour flight for the fixture in the city of Donetsk.

A BBC spokesman said: 'Panorama strongly refutes Mr Ornstein's allegation that it misrepresented his interview in the programme, Euro 2012: Stadiums of Hate.

'It was made clear to Mr Ornstein that the interview was being carried out in the context of football related racism and anti-Semitism in Poland and his contribution was clearly placed in this context in the film. The programme stated in commentary that he believes that most Poles happily accept other faiths but that football hooligans are yet to catch up with wider Polish society.

'Both the programme's producer and reporter deny refusing the offer to interview two Israeli footballers player in Poland because it did not fit the story, in fact they would have jumped at the chance of interviewing them.â€™
