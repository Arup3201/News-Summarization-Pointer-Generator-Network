Brave: Kate Dipper, pictured, who was badly bullied over the internet has decided to mentor others who are suffering because of vicious trolls

Hundreds of terrorised children often on the verge of suicide are calling the police every day because they are viciously bullied on Facebook.

Britain's forces fear this could be 'the tip of the iceberg' as more youngsters are certainly suffering in silence.

Many are constantly being bombarded with abusive messages or have Facebook pages set up just to bully them.

Today one of the most senior police 
officers in the UK has spoken out on the issue.

Greater Manchester Police chief 
constable Peter Fahy says children are being terrorised by 
cyber-bullies, and in his region alone 10 children dial 999 every 24 hours about the issue.

These complaints do not include ones made about trolls bullying
on Twitter, other social networking sites or by text, with experts claiming up to one in three schoolchildren will suffer cyber-bullying at some point.

'While it is difficult to capture the true figure, we have on average of ten reports a day across the whole force concerning Facebook,' Mr Fahy said.

'I am sure our figures are just the tip of the iceberg because many do not report it or decide to switch off their account.

'People need to realise that harassment is a criminal offence and can cause huge distress whether carried out on Facebook or elsewhere.'

Living in fear: It is estimated one in three youngsters will be cyber-bullied at some point

Manchester schoolgirl Kate Dipper has told how she was left ‘with no escape’ when bullies began to target her both at school and online - and how she bounced back with the help of a life-saving mentoring programme.

The 16-year-old, who lives in Stockport, said: 'It started with a small group saying that I had looked stupid and evil when I was younger, and who would want to be in my family. Then it went round the whole school. I couldn’t understand why they were doing it. It made me feel sad and angry because there was no escape.'

Warning: Greater Manchester Police's chief constable Peter Fahy, pictured, says his force receives at least ten calls per day from Facebook-bullied children

But Kate’s story is by no means unusual, according to charity ChildLine.

They say cyber-bullying is behind 11 per cent of all thousands of calls they receive.

The head of ChildLine has blamed 
social networking sites such as Facebook for fuelling what the charity 
claims is a huge rise in the number of children who deliberately harm 
themselves.

Data from hospitals reveals a 68 per cent increase in the number of under-24s admitted for ‘self-inflicted injuries’.

Sue Minto said the internet and mobile phones meant young  people were being exposed to cyber-bullying 24 hours a day.

Launching
a self-harm awareness campaign last month, which is being supported by X Factor 
judge Tulisa Contostavlos, Mrs Minto said such pressure could cause 
children to begin cutting themselves or engage in risky behaviour such 
as drinking or using drugs.

Research suggests the number of children
and young people who deliberately hurt themselves on a regular basis 
has risen significantly over the past ten years.

Facebook say they do they all they can to protect their members.

'Nothing is more important to us than the safety and security of the people who use the site. Unfortunately, one person determined to harass another will find ways to do so, both online and offline,' a spokesman said.

'On Facebook there are a number of measures people can use to stay safe. We encourage people to use our reporting tools, accessible across the entire site, use our blocking tools to prevent unwanted contact, and visit our Safety Centre, which contains tips about how to use Facebook as safely as possible.

'Facebook operates a "real name" policy to ensure people are accountable.'
