Anthony Skinner saw Miley but was so nervous that he 'froze up' and couldn't think of anything to say

‘I started looking for a way in thinking to myself ‘What’s the worst that can happen? They kick me out? The concert’s already over,”” Skinner told Faster Louder.

‘Found boots, a fluro vest and gloves in the carpark cleaners storeroom (sic),’ Mr Skinner posted to his Facebook page.

‘Put it all on, my shoes and possessions in a garbage bag, that garbage bag in a wheelie bin, then walked through the back boom gate where everyone was waiting for her car.

‘How goods that. This is possibly the best thing I’ve ever done!’

Mr Skinner left a note for Miley Cyrus in the pocket of his treasured leopard print jacket. The 23-year-old gave the jacket to an official, who promised to hand it on to the young pop sensation

Mr Skinner claims that in his hi-vis gear pushing a wheelie bin security let him go straight backstage, where Miley Cyrus’ after party was allegedly due to take place.

Secu ‘didn’t even look at me.’

‘My mindest was “see how far you can take this,”’ Mr Skinner explained to bbc.co.uk.

‘It wasn’t planned at all. Everything just fell into place so perfectly.’

Once he was in, it wasn’t all fun and games.

To blend in, Mr Skinner stayed in character, cleaning Allphones Arena for 40 minutes.

Before the concert, Mr Skinner posted a selfie on Instagram wearing the jacket that gave to Miley that night, with a note hidden in the pocket with his contact details 

According to Mr Skinner, Miley Cyrus walked past him and smiled at him, but he was too nervous to talk to her.

‘As she walked past all I could muster was a gentle ‘hey’ with a smile and some eye contact. She definitely noticed me… 

'I froze up, choked, and could barely get any words out, my mind just went completely empty,’ Skinner told Faster Louder.

‘(I) wish I grabbed a photo with her… I was so scared,’ Mr Skinner wrote on his Facebook page.

‘But obviously I couldn’t just whip my phone out. But… I was like “hey.”’

However, Mr Skinner did muster up the strength to leave a note for Miley Cyrus, hidden in a leopard print jacket which he handed to an ‘official looking man’.

‘It’s literally the most perfect jacket ever made,” he explains. 

Mr Skinner desperately hopes Miley receives his note, which includes his mobile number, Instagram and Twitter accounts.

‘Miley,Keep killing it babe. Loved you from the start. Chillz,’ the letter read.

After the incredible incident, Mr Skinner was sent a questionnaire by Allphones Arena, asking him to rate his experience at the concert. 

The young man found questions about 'ease of access', 'overall cleanliness inside the arena' and 'security & safety precautions during the event' particularly amusing. 

'Overall cleanliness? Very satisfied, I did half of it myself,' Mr Skinner joked to BBC.
