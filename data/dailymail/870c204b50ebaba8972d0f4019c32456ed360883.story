She was chosen out of many young girls in India to meet the Obamas during their three-day visit to India this week.

The First Lady hugged Payal while her husband met with Nobel Peace Prize winner and anti-child labor activist Kailash Satyarthi. 

Payal, from Virat Nagar, on the outskirts of Jaipur, in the western state of Rajasthan, is a leader of the child parliament in her village, and admits she did not know who Michelle Obama was until she met her.

She said: 'She was lovely and after she hugged me people started asking me how I felt. I kept asking people why are people so interested and only then did I come to know how popular Michelle is.'

She added: 'I was surprised when she hugged me as most famous personalities do not even talk to poor people like me.

'She even took out a ring and handed it to me but I politely refused to take it as my parents have taught me to not take gifts. I was already in awe of her and didn't know how to react in that moment.

'She praised me for my work and that was the biggest present. I had tears in my eyes.

'She told me her younger daughter is my age and that she would bring her to meet me when she visits India next.'

Payal, along with 12 other activists aged between 10-14 years old, is very vocal about child rights and encourages parents in her village to send their children to school.

She said: 'In our society education is not given much importance but it is my duty to explain to the older generation how schooling is very much needed.

'We formed this council comprising of children to speak about the problems faced by our peers and why we need school. I think that's why I was chosen to meet the Obamas because I'm trying to improve my community.'

In 2013, Payal was chosen from a dozen candidates in her class to lead the children council.

She said: 'We organize meetings and discuss various issues like lack of separate toilets for girls in schools and the need to stop child marriage and let children be children.

'We go from door to door and explain to parents the importance of education. We also tell them not to beat their children and respect their emotions. If parents are loving and caring, children will have a better environment to grow. We aim to make our village 'child friendly'.'

Payal, whose father works as a carpenter, is in a government-run school and dreams of becoming a teacher so that she can 'give education to underprivileged children when I am older'. 

She said: 'I want to make most of this opportunity and aim to become a teacher so that I can give education to underprivileged children when I am older.'

Payal who has two sisters and one brother, has been working with Bachpan Bachao Andolan (Save the Childhood) since 2012. It's an India-based movement campaigning for the rights of children started in 1980 by Nobel Peace Prize winner Kailash Satyarthi. 

Payal now spends most of her free time going round rural villages to stop child marriages. 

For her active participation in promoting children's rights, Payal was also chosen as the jury member of the World Children's Prize that awarded Malala Yousafzai, in October 2014.
