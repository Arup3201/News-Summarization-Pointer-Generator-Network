Are you qualified to address both the 'shocks and stresses that weaken the fabric' of Melbourne on a day to day basis?

If so, the position of the Chief Resilience Officer could be just the job for you at a total employment package of $236,544 per annum on a two-year contract.

To be paid more than three times the average wage in Australia, you will need to establish a vision and drive the resilience conversation in the city, and also implement the resilience strategy across metropolitan Melbourne by working with relevant Victorian agencies.

If you’re still unclear on what is required of you in the role – you must have excellent leadership skills, the ability to engage positively with a wide range of stakeholders, and a broad background encompassing social, community, corporate, financial and project management abilities and understanding.

The Rockefeller Foundation launched the 100 Resilient Cities Centennial Challenge in 2013 for those cities to ‘better address the increasing shocks and stresses of the 21st century’.

Melbourne is one of the initial 33 cities chosen across the globe, and the only one in Australia, selected by judges with unique expertise on tools and strategies that make a city 'better prepared to face natural and man-made disaster'.

The Rockefeller Foundation, which has promoted the well being of humanity throughout the world for more than 100 years, supplies the funding for the position in each city and provides the support to develop and deliver a resilience strategy.

If you’re still not sold on the City Of Melbourne role - it has been plugged as a ‘Unique Australian opportunity’ in ‘The World’s Most Liveable City’.
