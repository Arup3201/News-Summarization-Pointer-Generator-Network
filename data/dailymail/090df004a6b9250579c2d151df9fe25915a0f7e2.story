Ever since Marty McFly made his getaway on a hoverboard in Back to the Future II, gadget fans have been dreaming of floating along on their own device.

Now, Californian architect Greg Henderson has made that dream come true by developing a hoverboard that floats in mid-air just like the 1980s classic film.

Dubbed the Hendo Hoverboard, the technology uses four ‘hover engines’ which emit magnetic fields that push against each other as long as metal conductor is used in the surface underneath.

The idea came to Mr Henderson while he was trying to find ways of building structures that can better withstand earthquakes.

As part of his research, he came up with a method that uses electromagnetic fields to separate the building from the ground in the event of a disaster.

That same technology, he realised, could also be put to work in a hoverboard that would allow people to glide on air.

In a video released by Mr Henderson, a man is seen moving smoothly along a custom-built skate ramp on his board, which is held an inch of the ground.

Unlike the Back to the Future board, the technology requires the board to be on top of conductive materials to serve as a secondary magnetic field

Unlike the Back to the Future board, the technology requires the board to be on top of conductive materials - such as copper or aluminum -  to serve as a secondary magnetic field.

The Hendo Hoverboard uses four ‘hover engines’ which emit magnetic fields that push against each other.

The magnets only work as long as metal conductor is used in the surface underneath. So the board underneath the Hendo can be aluminum and copper to work, for instance.

The innovation here is in the efficiency of the induction process and the ability to control the movements of the hovering objects.

The system claims to be able to carry 40lbs (18kg) and has a battery that lasts for around seven minutes.

Maglev trains use similar technology but laying down a track costs around £464,000 ($750,000) per metre. 

Mr Henderson, however, claims its technology would only cost £6,200 ($10,000) per metre of track.

Mr Henderson’s 19-person company, Arx Pax, is now making the technology inside the device available to the public on crowd funding site Kickstarter.

The company is hoping to raise £155,000 ($250,000) for the campaign and will sell the technology for £185 ($299) in a box it calls the Hover Engine developer kit.

Buyers can take the hover tech outside of the box and put it in anything they want to hover. It can carry 40lbs (18kg) and has a battery that lasts for around seven minutes.

‘We want to see what you can do with our technology,’ the company writes on their Kickstarter page.

‘You can use it for hovering, or for applications we haven't even imagined.’

Consumers can also buy the complete Hendo hoverboard from £6,200 ($10,000).

In the meantime, the group is working on something called the G-Ray, which will allow people to control the hover technology remotely using a smartphone app.

But they only work if a metal conductor is used in surface underneath
