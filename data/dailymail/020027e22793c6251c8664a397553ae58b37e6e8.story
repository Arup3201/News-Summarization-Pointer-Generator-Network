Manchester United are in talks with former Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes.

Manager Louis van Gaal has offered the 32-year-old a chance to complete his rehabilitation from a knee injury and to work his way back to fitness with the club.

Valdes, a free agent, will have his recovery supervised by the United medical staff before training with the first team, as he bids to regain full fitness.

Valdes played 535 games for Barcelona over 12 glorious years. Here he is pictured lifting the European Cup after Barcelona's 2009 triumph over Manchester United in the final in Rome

The free agent had been expected to join fierce rivals Liverpool but Brendan Rodgers this week indicated that deal was off amid suggestions Valdes was not keen on a four day training stint prior to signing.

Valdes has been out for six months with knee ligament damage, an injury that scuppered a proposed move to Monaco. However, he is now fit again and looking for a club to suit his ambitions.

Valdes was at United's Carrington training HQ yesterday along with his representatives and is keen to discuss all possibilities.

For their part United want to see how he has recovered from his injury before committing to a contract and will assess his recovery before offering anything.

United are in talks over a new contract for David de Gea but they want improved competition for the 23-year-old Spain international and Valdes certainly fits the bill having won an array of honours during a glittering career.

Meanwhile, Michael Carrick will continue his recovery from ankle ligament damage on Friday. The 33-year-old has been out since July but is due to play for United's U21s against West Ham United at Rush Green.

The England midfielder was an unused substitute for Monday night's 2-2 draw at West Bromwich Albion and was expected to be part of the squad to face Chelsea at Old Trafford on Sunday.

The time for recovery between games means he will likely take his place on the bench once again rather than figure from the start against Jose Mourinho's title chasers.

United striker Robin van Persie is anticipating an edgy contest between the two rivals.

The Dutchman, who has come under criticism for his lacklustre performances of late, said: 'Chelsea have a very good team and we have a good team. But it's always a bit more edgy and I like that. You can sense that as well with the fans because they are a bit more on top of it in games like this. So in every way it's a game to look forward to.

'There's always a bit of a different feeling but it's not that we're less concentrated for other games but there's a bit extra tension in a good way. You don't really know what's going to happen before the game because it can go both ways.'
