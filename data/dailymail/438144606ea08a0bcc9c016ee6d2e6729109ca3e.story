Bojan Krkic’s decision to leave Barcelona and join Stoke City may appear strange – particularly as the 23-year-old should be about to enter his prime.

But he’s not the first footballer to undergo a transfer that has left everyone else open-mouthed and scratching their heads.

See if you agree with our list of the 10 great jaw-dropping moves.

Bit of a gamble: Bojan Krkic has officially made the move to Mark Hughes' Stoke from Barcelona

Big move: Once first-choice ahead of Zlatan Ibrahimovic the transfer is somewhat of a surprise for most

Simonsen was one of the game’s superstars and had been crowned European footballer of the year in 1977. When Diego Maradona joined Barcelona in 1982, he had to make way but nobody could have predicted he would turn up next at Second Division Charlton Athletic.

Alas, it didn’t work out. Great Dane Simonsen only played 17 times before the south-east London club were unable to pay his considerable wages. To prove there were no hard feelings though, Simonsen has been back to The Valley since as a fan.

Ill-fated: 1977's European Footballer of the Year, Barcelona's Allan Simonsen, played just 17 times for Charlton

2 DIDIER DROGBA – CHELSEA TO SHANGHAI SHENHUA, 2012

Drogba chose a radical new challenge after scoring the decisive shoot-out penalty for Chelsea in the 2012 Champions League final that cemented his status as one of the club’s greatest-ever players.

His arrival at Shanghai Shenhua was meant to revolutionise Chinese football in a similar way to David Beckham and the MLS. But the partnership failed to work and Drogba headed back west to Galatasaray just six months into his contract despite protestations from Shanghai.

3 JUNINHO – SAO PAOLO TO MIDDLESBROUGH, 1995

Some questioned the midfielder’s sanity when he swapped the passion and excitement of Brazil’s largest city for industrial Teesside, attracted by the Bryan Robson revolution that was going on.

Thousands of Boro fans turned out to see their diminutive new star arrive and the hospitality worked.

Juninho fell in love with the north-east, and ended up having three spells with the club. Famously he helped them reach two cup finals in 1997 and was left in tears when they were relegated from the Premier League on the final day of the same season.

Surprise: Brazil star Juninho made the move from Sao Paulo to Bryan Robson's Middlesbrough

4 JONATHAN WOODGATE – REAL MADRID TO MIDDLESBROUGH, 2007

This is not  meant to be a personal attack on Middlesbrough, but how many players would have considered moving from the Santiago Bernabeu to The Riverside.

Being a local boy like Woodgate helped and the defender was tempted by home comforts after three injury-plagued years in Spain, where he played in a Galactico side alongside the likes of Zinedine Zidane and David Beckham.

5 GLEN JOHNSON – CHELSEA TO PORTSMOUTH, 2007

Glen Johnson had been Roman Abramovich’s first signing after taking over at Chelsea and was tipped for great things at Stamford Bridge.

But when he fell out with Jose Mourinho, he was persuaded by sweet-talking Harry Redknapp to leave the King’s Road and play his football at ramshackle Fratton Park.

In the short-term, the move seemed to work with the player winning the FA Cup in 2008. But Pompey were living beyond their means and Johnson quickly joined the exodus from the south coast to join Liverpool.

6 KEVIN KEEGAN – HAMBURG TO SOUTHAMPTON, 1980

Keegan was the biggest superstar of his day; the reigning European player of the year and famous enough to make a pop record that went into the charts. His club Hamburg had just played in the European Cup final and were considered one of the biggest teams in Germany at the time.

So Keegan was the last person on journalists’ minds when unfashionable Southampton called a press conference – they thought it was to do with ground redevelopment at The Dell. There were audible gasps when Keegan, England’s captain, walked in with his new manager Lawrie McMenemy.

7 MICHAEL OWEN – REAL MADRID TO NEWCASTLE, 2005

Michael Owen was from the Ian Rush school of not fully appreciating foreign countries and was desperate to return to England after 12 months in La Liga.

The best financial offer on the table was from Newcastle so Liverpool legend Owen bit the bullet and signed on for manager Graeme Souness and chairman Freddie Shepherd for a club that hadn’t won a trophy since 1970.

He didn’t endear himself to Geordie fans by continuing to spend time in the north-west and flying up to training by helicopter. And a dismal four years was capped by relegation in 2009.

Dismal: Michael Owen's illustrious career has a black and white hole in it that ended with Newcastle's relegation

8 IVAN CAMPO – REAL MADRID TO BOLTON, 2003

The bushy-haired Campo had won the Champions League in five successful years in Madrid but when he fell out of favour at the start of the Galactico era, he decided Sam Allardyce and Bolton were for him.

After a year’s  loan to bed in, Campo joined on a permanent basis and became a huge favourite with Bolton fans, who turned up to matches wearing wigs in his honour. Allardyce also found a new role for Campo in holding midfield and he stayed at The Reebok for five seasons.

9 CRAIG BELLAMY – LIVERPOOL TO CARDIFF, 2012

New Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers wanted to keep Bellamy at Anfield where he’d just won the League Cup. But the Welshman wanted to be closer to his family in south wales and harboured a dream of helping his local club reach the Premier League for the first time, something he’d been unable to do in an earlier loan spell.

So Bellamy swapped the “This is Anfield” sign for the more modest trappings of Cardiff and had the last laugh when City won promotion under Malky Mackay, something the forward rated as the best achievement of his career.

Homecoming: Craig Bellamy was wanted by Liverpool but wanted more to help Cardiff get promoted - and did

10 ROBERTO MANCINI – LAZIO TO LEICESTER, 2001

Mancini was regarded as one of the best Italian players of his generation with 35 international caps and 15 years service with Sampdoria before moving to Lazio.

At the age of 36, he was persuaded by  Leicester manager Peter Taylor to come to England, the move suggested by Mancini’s former boss Sven Goran Eriksson who had worked with Taylor for the England national team.

Mancini’s legs had gone by the time he arrived in the east Midlands and he played only three times for The Foxes. On the plus side, he formed an unlikely friendship with another Leicester player, Robbie Savage, that lasts til this day.
