Philippe Coutinho has agreed a new long-term Liverpool deal, with Brendan Rodgers predicting he will become world-class.

The Brazil midfielder arrived at Anfield from Inter Milan in the January transfer window two years ago and has now signed a contract which takes him through to 2020. 

The move will be welcomed by supporters, who are also hoping to see Raheem Sterling sign a new deal soon.

Sportsmail revealed that Brazil midfielder Coutinho was close to signing a new deal earlier in the year, click here to see how we broke the story.

He set up both goals in Liverpool’s 2-0 win over West Ham on Saturday and it has prompted manager Rodgers to liken his qualities to those of Real Madrid’s Luka Modric. 

Liverpool's boss recognises that Coutinho needs to improve his goalscoring form — he has scored just twice this season — but believes the 22-year-old has the potential to blossom into one of the top performers in the Barclays Premier League. ‘You see his quality in his two assists at the weekend,’ said Rodgers. ‘They were sublime. The first pass was incredible invention.

‘If you look at Modric, he doesn’t have a big goalscoring record but he is a world-class player.

‘If he can improve his goalscoring, Coutinho will be getting into the bracket of being world-class.’

Liverpool are still hopeful of agreeing a deal with Burnley to sign striker Danny Ings to avoid the need for a tribunal when his contract ends in the summer.
