The families of British soldiers killed in battle have won a landmark legal victory that gives them the right to sue the Ministry of Defence.

The Supreme Court ruled that relatives of four servicemen who died in Iraq could seek compensation for negligence and breach of human rights.

The UK's highest court said the Government owed a duty of care to properly equip and train troops sent to war, but Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said he was 'concerned' that it could make it 'more difficult for troops to carry out operations'.

Danger: Relatives say the Snatch Land Rovers the soldiers were travelling in were unprotected (file image)

Tragedy: Lance Corporal Kirk Redpath (left) died in Iraq in 2007 and Corporal Stephen Allbutt's death in a friendly-fire incident in 2003 was condemned by a coroner as a 'completely avoidable tragedy'

Yesterday, the families were 
celebrating the ruling after an arduous fight for justice that has taken
 ten years and their lawyers said the decision meant the MoD could no 
longer be 'given carte blanche to fail to equip our troops'.

Three of the men were killed when 
their controversial Snatch Land Rovers were blown up by roadside bombs. 
The poorly protected vehicles – nicknamed 'mobile coffins' because of 
their vulnerability to blasts – were finally replaced in 2008.

Private Phillip Hewett, 21, of 
Tamworth, Staffordshire, died when his Snatch struck an improvised 
explosive device in July 2005; Private Lee Ellis, 23, of Wythenshaw, 
Greater Manchester, was killed in February 2006; and Lance Corporal Kirk
 Redpath, 22, of Romford, Essex, died in August 2007.

Their families 
argued that the MoD was culpable because it failed to provide adequately
 protected vehicles and knew the Land Rovers were vulnerable to blasts.

Eight years ago, Private Phillip Hewett died on a dusty battlefield in Iraq.

The 1st Battalion Staffordshire Regiment soldier was killed when the Snatch Land Rover he was in struck a bomb near the town of al-Amarah on July 16, 2005. He was 21.

Since then, his mother Sue Smith has fought her own battle – with the Ministry of Defence. She argued that the Government breached his human rights by negligently failing to provide adequately armoured vehicles.

MoD chiefs insisted that they could not be held liable because the troops died on the battlefield and not on a British army base or in the UK.

She took her fight to the High Court and the Appeal Court without success but finally triumphed yesterday.

Mrs Smith, 51, of Tamworth, Staffordshire, said: 'It has been like headbutting a wall. The MoD has argued and covered up every step of the way.'

She said she fought to prevent other families suffering a loss of a son in the way she did. 'Phillip is dead,' she said. 'Nothing is going to bring him back. But this might save other boys' lives in the future.'

The 'Snatch', originally used to grab 
rioters in Northern Ireland, weighs 3.5tons and has a 3.5-litre V8 
engine. Costing £60,000, it has become notorious for its lack of 
protection against roadside bombs and 37 UK personnel have been killed 
in them.

The MoD said the Human Rights Act did not apply because the soldiers died in Iraq and not on a British Army base or in the UK.

The court also upheld a ruling 
allowing the families of three other soldiers to sue the MoD for 
negligence over a 'friendly fire' incident in which a Challenger tank 
fired at another when an officer became 'disorientated'.

Corporal Stephen Allbutt, 35, of Sneyd
 Green, Stoke-on-Trent, was killed in the incident in March 2003. Lance 
Corporal Daniel Twiddy, of Stamford, Lincolnshire, and Trooper Andrew 
Julien, of Bolton, Greater Manchester, were badly injured.

Their families argued that the MoD was negligent for failing to properly equip the tanks and give soldiers adequate training.

MoD lawyers argued that the nature of the battlefield meant it was incompatible with the idea of a 'right to life'.

The rulings leave the MoD facing a multi-million pound bill for damages.

The cases could take two years to 
reach court and the Supreme Court justices warned the families they 
would have to prove a case for compensation.

Lord Hope, Deputy President of the 
Supreme Court, added: 'It is of paramount importance that the work the 
Armed Forces do in the national interest should not be impeded by having
 to prepare for or conduct active operations against an enemy under the 
threat of litigation if things go wrong.'

But Private Hewett's mother Susan 
Smith, 51, said of the judgment: 'It is brilliant. The MoD can no longer
 treat soldiers as sub-humans with no rights.'

Lance Corporal Redpath's father Colin,
 57, said: 'The MoD has now got a duty of care to supply our brave 
troops with the right equipment in a combat zone. In the past, the MoD 
could have given them a broomstick and that would have been okay.'

Corporal Allbutt's widow Debi, of Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, said: 'What we have achieved has changed history.'

Mr Hammond said: 'It can't be right 
that troops on operations have to put the European Convention on Human 
Rights ahead of what is operationally vital to protect our national 
security.'
