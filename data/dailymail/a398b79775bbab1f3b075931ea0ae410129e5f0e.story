The world record for the time it takes to devour a 72-ounce steak dinner was smashed on Monday by a 34-year-old mother from Nebraska.

Professional eater Molly Schuyler downed the massive steak dinner in a record-setting four minutes and 48 seconds at the Big Texan Steak Challenge in Amarillo, Texas.

If that weren't enough, she then devoured a second 72-ounce steak dinner in just under ten minutes.

Not content with just eating one giant steak, Schuyler then devoured a second 72-ounce steak dinner in just under ten minutes

‘We witnessed history,’ Big Texan co-owner Danny Lee told Amarillo.com. ‘If there’s a zombie apocalypse, I want to stay away from this girl.’

Self-described ‘bottomless pit’ Schuyler, is 5-foot-7 and weighs just 125 pounds.

Lee said Schuyler’s slight frame belies her eating ability and makes her accomplishment that much more remarkable.

'Molly had called about a year ago, she said, and we took it as a hoax,' he said.

Schuyler, from Bellevue, Nebraska, has competed in many eating competitions, setting records for eating contests that include pizza, hamburgers, burritos and other food items

'This little girl walked in here and… she’s one of the daintiest, smallest ladies that I’ve see try the 72-ounce steak.'

Schuyler, from Bellevue, Nebraska, has competed in many eating competitions, setting records for eating contests that include pizza, hamburgers, burritos and other food items.

In January, she devoured a record 363 wings in 30 minutes at a competition in Philadelphia, earning a $22,000 prize.

Schuyler said she plans to return to the Big Texan with the goal of eating three of the steak dinners in one sitting.

‘She done set the bar high for everybody, so there's not a male that comes in the door [laughs],' said Big Texan Steak Pit Master Tony Love.

‘If you can't eat two, then you've done nothing, you know what I'm saying?'
