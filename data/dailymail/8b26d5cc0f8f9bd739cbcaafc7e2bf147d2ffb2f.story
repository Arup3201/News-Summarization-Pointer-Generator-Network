Attack: Mervyn King called for a cultural change in British banking when he spoke today (pictured)

The Bank of England yesterday piled pressure on the Treasury to split the traditional high street operations of banks from their risky casino arms.

Governor Sir Mervyn King said the latest abuses by UK lenders reinforced the need to press on with the sweeping reforms recommended by the Independent Commission on Banking.

He said the proposals by the ICB, which was chaired by Sir John Vickers and included ring-fencing retail banking from investment banking, should be implemented in full.

It set up a potential clash with Chancellor George Osborne who has been accused of watering down some of the main proposals following months of lobbying by the banking industry.

Sir Mervyn said: ‘I would hope that Parliament would legislate on that as soon as they feel able to do so – all of the Vickers proposals. That is what we need to do to change the structure of the industry.’

He added: ‘We can see what has gone wrong. The idea that the culture of investment banking is the same as the culture of basic banking, I think it is very clear now that those two cultures are completely different, and they need to be separated.’

Officials played down any differences between the Governor and the Chancellor but the comments were seen as a warning to the Treasury not to back down.

It is hoped that the ring-fence will allow an investment bank rocked by heavy trading losses to fail without hurting savers, borrowers and small businesses.

Sir Mervyn said: ‘The main thing is to ensure that if the trading mentality leads to practices that we regard as rather unacceptable that it does not impinge on the part of the banking system about which we really care.

‘It is very important to recognise that as a society we really do want to underpin retail deposits, lending to households and SMEs (small and medium enterprises).

‘But we do not want to underpin people’s decisions to take risky portfolio investments, therefore the two should not be on the same balance sheet.’

Sir Mervyn said there was no need for
 a Leveson-style inquiry, although he admitted 'something went very 
wrong with the UK banking industry and we need to put it right'.

Yesterday,
 leading politicians including Labour's Ed Miliband called for an 
official inquiry into the conduct of banks, after it emerged Barclays 
and RBS were embroiled in attempts to fix the inter-bank lending rate.

Prime Minister David Cameron, pictured arriving for an EU leaders summit in Brussels this week, insisted the Government was committed to shaking up the banking system

Taxpayer-backed
 Royal Bank of Scotland also confirmed it was being investigated for 
manipulating the rates at which banks lend to each other, known as 
Libor.

Sir Mervyn said: 
'From excessive levels of compensation, to shoddy treatment of 
customers, to a deceitful manipulation of one of the most important 
interest rates and now news of yet another mis-selling scandal we can 
see we need a real change in the culture of the industry.'

He added that hard-working bank staff have been 'let down' and that banks now needed 'leadership of an unusually high order'.

David Cameron insisted the Government was committed to shaking up the banking system. ‘British people are crying out for a return to good old-fashioned banking and not put that at risk by big investment banking,’ said the Prime Minister.

‘That’s why the Governor is so in favour of changing culture at the banks and so am I.’

When the White Paper was published this month Sir John welcomed the proposed legislation but said that it ‘should go further’ on some points.

‘We welcome that the ICB proposals have been accepted in large part but urge the Government to resist pressure to weaken their effectiveness,’ he added.

The Financial Services Authority (FSA) revealed earlier that Barclays, HSBC, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group had agreed to pay compensation to customers who were mis-sold interest-rate hedging products.

Some 28,000 of the products have been sold since 2001 and may have been offered as protection - or to act as a hedge - against a rise in interest rates without the customer fully grasping the downside risks.

The City regulator has slammed banks ever since for authorising the deals, which are so complicated that many entrepreneurs simply didn't understand them.

Many of those clients are now facing bankruptcy.

Speaking during a visit in Lincoln 
with war veterans ahead of Armed Forces Day tomorrow, Ed Miliband called
 for an inquiry into the whole industry and said it was clear that change was 
needed at Barclays.

His calls were backed by shadow
 chancellor Ed Balls, who said there was a case for an inquiry into the 
culture of banking, while business secretary Vince Cable voiced no 
objections.

The 
Leveson Inquiry, presided over by Lord Justice Leveson, was set up by 
Prime Minister David Cameron in July last year to look into the ethics 
and practices in the press following the phone hacking scandal that has 
engulfed News International.

The Labour leader said: 'We definitely need an inquiry into the culture and practices of the industry.

'What's been revealed with Barclays is
 a set of practices which have appalled people across the country and 
we've got to make sure we shine a light in all the corners of the 
industry to find out why these practices have been going on and what it 
is about the culture that has enabled this to happen.'

He added: 'I think its pretty clear the change that is required at Barclays.

'I think it's very hard to see that being led by Bob Diamond.

'If I was a shareholder in Barclays I 
would be asking myself 'Well, obviously we need big change here. Who is 
going to be able to bring that change and restore confidence in Barclays
 and the system?'

'I am calling for change at Barclays. 
It's obviously a matter for the shareholders in the end but I think that
 it is very hard to see how the current leadership, who were there when 
some of these things were going on, can bring about the changes 
required.'

Mr Balls told 
BBC News: 'I don't think it's right for the Government ministers or the 
Governor to say we have had enough inquiries.

'Why is there a culture where people 
in quite senior positions seem to think they can get away with rigging 
markets and acting in a duplicitous way?

'I do think that these calls we are 
seeing today for a proper, independent, arm's-length inquiry which looks
 at the future and how we can get back on to a more open and honest 
footing, but also looks at the self-regulation of the 1980s and 1990s 
and the way in which the FSA regulated in the last decade - I think 
there is now a case.

'We can't just brush this under the 
carpet. People are shocked by the swaggering arrogance of what we have 
discovered in the last 24 hours. We need to open this wide open.'

On Wednesday it emerged that Barclays was fined £290 million by UK and US regulators for manipulating the rate at which banks lend to each other, and echoes the costly payment protection insurance (PPI) mis-selling scandal that emerged last year.

Banks are facing the threat of a criminal investigation over fixing the interbank lending figures that affect millions of homeowners and small firms.

The Treasury has started to look at strengthening criminal sanctions for those responsible for market abuse after the FSA exposed the dealings at Barclays on Wednesday.

 among several other lenders being investigated by the City watchdog

Serious Fraud Office investigators are in talks with the regulator over the scandal, while pressure is mounting on Barclays chief executive Bob Diamond to stand down.

Prime Minister David Cameron said it was very important that accountability for what went on 'goes all the way to the top of that organisation' and that Mr Diamond had 'some serious questions to answer'.

'Heavy price': TUC General Secretary Brendan Barber said Britain's banking system was 'out of control'

HSBC and taxpayer-backed Royal Bank of Scotland are among several other lenders being investigated by the City watchdog for trying to influence Libor - London interbank offered rate - and Euribor interbank lending rates to boost their profits.

Sir Mervyn said there needed to be a change in the way Libor was calculated based on 'observations of actual market transactions' rather than getting banks to supply rates.

'The idea that my word is my Libor is dead,' he added.

He also backed proposals to ringfence retail banking divisions from investment arms as a way of addressing some of the issues that have emerged from the most recent developments.

TUC General Secretary Brendan Barber said Britain's banking system was 'out of control'.

He said: 'We are now paying a heavy price for the decades when banks and finance persuaded politicians that they were the new engines of growth.'

Shadow chancellor Ed Balls disagreed with the Bank Governor and said there was a case for an inquiry into the culture of banking.

He said: 'We can't just brush this under the carpet. People are shocked by the swaggering arrogance of what we have discovered in the last 24 hours. We need to open this wide open.'
