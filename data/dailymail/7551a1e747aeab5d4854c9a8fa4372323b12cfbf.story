Labour education spokesman Tristram Hunt said the change would help to give teachers the same standing as professionals like doctors and lawyers

Teachers would have to be licensed and could be sacked if they fail tough checks on their abilities, under plans unveiled by Labour.

Shadow education secretary Tristram Hunt said the change would help give teachers the same standing as professionals such as doctors and lawyers.

A similar proposal was floated by the previous Labour government - and branded 'classroom MoTs' by former schools secretary Ed Balls.

However, it was opposed by some teaching unions and dropped before the 2010 general election.

Reviving the controversial plan, Mr Hunt told the BBC he wanted the 'enormously important' role of teachers to be recognised.

'Just
 like lawyers and doctors they should have the same professional 
standing which means re-licensing themselves, which means continued 
professional development, which means being the best possible they can 
be,' he said.

'If you're not
 a motivated teacher - passionate about your subject, passionate about 
being in the classroom - then you shouldn't really be in this 
profession.'

Teachers would 
need to be able to show not only that they are teaching pupils to a high
 standard but also that they are keeping their subject knowledge and 
skills refreshed through regular training.

Those
 who fail to demonstrate that they had done so would be refused a 
licence to teach, effectively banning them from the profession.

Mr
 Hunt would not be drawn on how often teachers would be assessed. In 
coming months he would be discussing the policy's possible 
implementation with professional organisations, he said.

Teachers'
 unions gave Mr Hunt's plan a guarded welcome, insisting that, for it to
 work, it must be linked to greater access to high-quality training.

'With
 the fragmentation of our education system, access to high-quality 
continual professional development has been like finding an oasis in the
 desert,' Mary Bousted of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers told
 The Times.

Brett Wigdortz, founder of education 
charity Teach First, said that Mr Hunt's plan would bring the UK into 
line with countries like Finland and Singapore, which are renowned for 
their education systems.

But
 Kevin Courtney, general secretary of the National Union of Teachers, 
warned against any policy that was a continuation of the Coalition's 
'judgemental prescription of how teachers teach.'

Mr Hunt told The Times: 'If we want to re-professionalise the teachers it would be crazy not to do it.

'If teachers are not re-licensed they will not be allowed to teach.'

'Passionate': Teachers would need to be able to show not only that they are teaching pupils to a high standard but also that they are keeping their subject knowledge and skills refreshed through regular training

The Opposition has previously said it would insist on all teachers having Qualified Teacher Status, with staff already working in academies given a deadline to acquire a formal qualification.

A Conservative Party spokesman said it was willing to look any proposals which will 'genuinely improve the quality of teaching'.

He said: 'We have already taken action by allowing heads to remove teachers from the classroom in a term, as opposed to a year previously, and scrapping the three-hour limit on classroom observations.

'We are improving teacher training, expanding Teach First and allowing heads to pay good teachers more. Thanks to our reforms, a record proportion of top graduates are entering the profession.

'Fixing the schools system so young people have the skills they need is a key part of our long-term economic plan.'
