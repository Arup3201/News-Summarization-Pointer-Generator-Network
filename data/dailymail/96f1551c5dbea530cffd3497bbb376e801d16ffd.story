A remarkable video has been released showing a pair of thrill-seeking base jumpers leaping from the 48th floor of a London skyscraper.

The video, recorded by cameras attached to the jumpers themselves, shows the two identifying the jump site, preparing their stunt and their hair-raising fall to the streets below.

The film shows the two visiting the Attic Bar at Pan Peninsula in Canary Wharf, east London, as though they are regular customers and even drinking a beer before entering the toilets, attaching their parachutes and leaping from the smoking balcony.

Not the first time: There have been a number of base jumps attempted from London's high rise buildings

The identity of the two base jumpers remains obscured throughout the video. A spokesman for the Attic Bar said it 'would never consent to or condone' such a 'reckless act'.

EpicTV,
 the extreme sports website which posted the video, said the jumpers' 
mission was to find an 'unjumped' exit within the London city limits.

While
 finding a tall building to jump from in London was not hard, access 
proved to be difficult but they said the Attic Bar, 'fit the bill 
perfectly'.

Base jumping involves jumping from fixed objects, such as skyscrapers or tall man-made structures, using a parachute to break the fall

Base jumping is an extreme sport which has gained prominence in recent years, often through its participants' bold stunts.

It involves jumping from fixed objects, such as skyscrapers or tall man-made structures, using a parachute to break the fall.

There have been a number of base jumps attempted from London's high rise buildings.

Most notably, Dan Witchalls, a roofer from Essex, has jumped from the top of The Shard four times. In fact, Mr Witchalls has jumped many of London's landmarks, including the London Eye, Nelson's Column, Wembley Stadium and the O2 Arena.

Stuntman Gary Connery has also base jumped from the top of Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square. Video of the jump shows only split seconds of freefall before he has to active his parachute.

One of the jumpers said via a statement: 'This jump is something that we’ve been planning for a good few years now - looking at safety issues, access to the bar, where we could get changed, outside areas and a quick escape route too.

'On the night itself, we were there for a few hours just chatting.

'The windspeed was a bit too high so we were just waiting for it to pass.

'When last orders was called, we checked the windspeed again and luckily it was safe so that was our moment to jump.

‘It was an incredibly ballsy way to do it.

'Striding across the bar and the bar staff just didn’t spot us, or try to stop us.

'Now, I just have a huge sense of accomplishment having succeeded in jumping off such an iconic building in London.'

The pair were later pulled over by police who decided not to take action.

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police today said the two had not broken any law.
