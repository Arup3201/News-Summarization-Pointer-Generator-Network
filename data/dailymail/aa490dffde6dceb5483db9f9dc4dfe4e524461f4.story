CNN’s new morning show came in third on its opening day amid mixed reviews which said it was a ‘shaky investment’ for the network.

New Day got a total of 247,000 viewers which meant that languished behind Fox’s Fox & Friends and MSNBC’s Morning Joe.

Among the coveted demographic group of adults aged 25-54 it fared even worse and came in fourth, behind HLN’s Morning Express as well.

New Day: CNN's new morning show came in third on its opening day amid mixed reviews which said it was a 'shaky investment' for the network.

CNN has put significant resources into New Day which is part of a wider shake up of the network brought about by new boss Jeff Zucker

Reviewers said that New Day, which runs from 6am to 9am, brings ‘nothing new to the table’ and that anchor Andrew Cuomo looked too macho and was ‘uneasy and out of place’.

They also said it felt like ‘overkill’ because CNN used eight of its own correspondents for live interviews during the debut.

CNN has put significant resources into New Day which is part of a wider shake up of the network brought about by new boss Jeff Zucker.

He axed Soledad O’Brien’s Starting Point and replaced her with Cuomo, who joined from ABC, Kate Bolduan and Michaela Pereira.

New Day has been billed as ‘newsy not drowsy’ and the first show was packed with current affairs and very few puff pieces or cookery segments.

According to Nielsen, Fox & Friends, was the top cable morning news show with 1.06m viewers helped by an appearance by Sarah Palin whilst Morning Joe averaged 355,000 total viewers.

Among the 25-54 age bracket, New Day got 95,000 viewers behind 262,000 for Fox & Friends, 132,000 for Morning Joe and 121,000 for Morning Express.

Writing on TV Newser, critics Gail Shister said the problem was that Cuomo’s ‘testosterone level is off the charts’ and that it all felt ‘overdone’.

She said: ‘While Bolduan and Pereira gabbed like girlfriends around the glass table, the uber-intense Cuomo seemed uneasy and out of place.

‘Face it, the guy can make a lost-kitten story sound like a mass murder.’

She also asked that he stop calling interviewees ‘my friend’ and said it makes him seem ‘unctuous’ and ‘irritating’.

New York Daily News critics Don Kaplan said that he thought the hosts were ‘overcaffinated’ but that overall he thought it showed promise.

He said: ‘The show's greatest weakness appeared to be that it brought almost nothing new to the table - something "New Day" is going to need in order to stand out from its tough competition’.

The figures were not all bad for New Day and among the 25-54 demographic they were 19 per cent higher than the Monday the previous week.

Compared to the same week last year the numbers were up 25 per cent among total viewers.

Writing in the New York Times Alessandra Stanley was more complimentary but said New Day still had some work to do.

She wrote: ‘The tone is fresher, the presentation is dolled-up, but it's still an earnest, news-driven operation with more diligence than panache.

‘Monday's premiere was promising, but the challenge for this morning show isn't just to be more spirited; it should also be smarter.’
