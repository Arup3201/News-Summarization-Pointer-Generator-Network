Mario Balotelli will be given a final chance by Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers despite growing disenchantment within the club over the Italian’s form and off-the-field difficulties.

Balotelli is currently out of action with a groin injury and faces a ban of up to five matches after being charged for posting a ‘racist and anti-Semitic’ message on social media.

He's only managed to score twice since joining Liverpool from AC Milan for £16million at the end of the last transfer window, and  has attracted controversy wherever he has played. He was once described by Jose Mourinho as ‘unmanageable’.

Mario Balotelli has failed to live up to expectations since arriving at Anfield for £16m this summer

Lacking in firepower, Liverpool were held to a goalless draw against Sunderland on Saturday

However, Liverpool are not actively looking to sell the player in January, believing the summer is a more realistic time to make a decision if the situation has not improved.

With Daniel Sturridge out injured until the new year, Rodgers has admitted his options up front are thin, with 32-year-old Rickie Lambert and Sunderland target Fabio Borini his only other senior strikers.

Rodgers has defended the decision to buy Balotelli, saying it was done out of necessity and with the backing of owner John W Henry and chief executive Ian Ayre.

Rodgers said: ‘Daniel Sturridge has shown in his career so far that he gets injuries. So, to go with no one would have been very difficult for us.

‘It would be unfair to leave Rickie Lambert maybe as a 32-year-old as the only striker we had. I felt this was a risk we needed to take with Mario because as a group we couldn’t afford not to at the time. It was late on and we needed to have someone in. It’s something that we can’t regret.’

Balotelli, 24, will strongly defend the FA charge, insisting the post on Instagram that included the comment ‘jumps like a black man and grabs coins like a Jew’ was an attack on racial stereotypes.

Balotelli’s mother is Jewish and he also suffered regular racist abuse when playing in Italy.
