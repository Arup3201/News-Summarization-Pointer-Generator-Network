An American couple have spoken of their joy after returning from Russia with the adopted son they thought they'd never have.

Robert and Kim Summers from New Jersey, were just weeks away from picking up little Preston from a Moscow orphanage, when the Russian President Vladimir Putin passed a ban on Americans adopting Russian children.

The move was widely seen as retaliation for a U.S. law which targeted Russians suspected of violating human rights.

Despite feeling that the odds were stacked against them, the Summers travelled to Russia mid-January so they could at least try to bring Preston back

At the time the Summers were 
devastated, with Robert breaking down in tears on television as he made a
heartfelt plea to Putin to reconsider the policy

He told CBS at the time: 'I cannot put into words how my wife and I feel right now.

'And we ask Putin, please, consider alternate means, but don't let these children suffer. Please. That's all we ask.'

But despite feeling that the odds were 
stacked against them, the Summers travelled to Russia mid-January so 
they could at least try to bring Preston back.

In an interview with CBS Mrs Summers 
recalled: 'We did not know. We just prayed and kept the faith and just 
kept believing that, you know, all of our efforts would pay off.'

The couple thought all hope was lost after a clerk at a Russian government office refused to process as passport for Preston.

'She looked at it and she said in Russian, "Americans? I thought there was a ban on Americans. How could we give them this passport?"' Kim recalled.

'We held our breath and I gasped for air and I said, oh no. Please, don't let us go through all this and we're going to have problems," Robert added.

The couple were save thanks to a loophole which stated that because the judge had already signed off on their adoption before the law was passed.

They returned the next day and were issued a passport for Preston. Five days later, they left Russia and brought Preston home.

'Robert and I looked at each other and we said, it's over, it's over. And I can't even tell you the relief. And how elated we are,' said Kim.

'I completely understand when a mother says that she takes one look at her newborn child and is instantly in love with that child. I'm in love with him. I'm in love with him, and I do believe he's in love with us, too.'

The Summers were one of an estrimated 1,0000 American families caught in teh middle of the adoption process when the ban was passed.

The State Department estimates just 50 of those will be allowed to return to the U.S. with their children.
