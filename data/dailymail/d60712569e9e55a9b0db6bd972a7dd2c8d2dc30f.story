A teenager walking in the rain with her fiance died when he fumbled with their umbrella and accidentally pushed her into the road.

Grace Dyson, 18, fell under the wheels of a van – that was being driven by her uncle.

The chances of the accident happening and the coincidence of a relative being behind the wheel were ‘unbelievable’, a policeman told an inquest yesterday.

Engaged: Grace Dyson (left), 18, was walking in the rain to a fish and chip shop with her fiancé Jason Booth (right) - when the tip of his brolly became caught in a crevice in a wall

Accident: Grace, who was walking with Mr Booth (left, pictured outside the court today), fell into oncoming traffic at the same second her uncle Ivan Beaumont (right, also outside court), 41, was passing in his van

Miss Dyson, an apprentice administrator, ‘wobbled and slipped like when you turn over on your ankle’, and the van driver had ‘no time to brake’, Detective Sergeant Noel Lowden told the hearing.

The accident left Grace, a talented linguist, with ‘non-survivable head injuries’ as the split-second knock threw her under the Nissan Cabstar, Huddersfield Coroner’s Court was told. 

Miss Dyson’s heartbroken fiance, Jason Booth, 21, said he lost her in a ‘split second’. The couple, who had been dating for 14 months, were heading to a fish and chip shop in Holmfirth, West Yorkshire, when tragedy struck.

Mr Booth, a chemistry student at Huddersfield University, was holding an umbrella over them both as they walked along a pavement in the next-door village of Thongsbridge.

Tributes: Flowers at the scene following the fatal crash in August last year in Thongsbridge, West Yorkshire

Remembered: A flag for the metal band Rammstein was among the tributes left at the scene in Thongsbridge

He told the inquest: ‘It was raining quite badly. It was quite a big umbrella with an elongated handle.

‘When we set off the brolly was up. On the side of the pavement we were walking down there was a dry stone wall - I was nearest to the wall and Grace was on my left.

Couple: Chemistry student Mr Booth said he and 18-year-old Grace (pictured above) were ‘inseparable’

‘The metal end of the umbrella got stuck in a crevice in the wall. It made me jolt to the left hand side - I remember seeing Grace’s foot slip over the edge. I think that’s when she fell.’

Driving past at that moment was labourer Ivan Beaumont – Miss Dyson’s uncle – who was coming home from work. 

He told police he had spotted his niece and was about to wave to her when she toppled into the road and under his Nissan Cabstar van. A passer-by rushed over to help but said there was little that could be done for Miss Dyson.

She was pronounced dead by the emergency services when they arrived. Mr Beaumont was questioned by police but not charged. Det Sgt Lowden said: ‘He had no time. She fell in the road and hit her with his van. It all happened so quick and she went under the wheel’.

He added: ‘It’s a tragic set of circumstances that Grace lost her footing at that exact time. Sadly this proved fatal. The chances of this occurring are unbelievable.’

Mr Beaumont was questioned by police but no charges were ever brought.  

Eyewitness Lesley Hardy, who was driving on the other side of the narrow road at the time, said he stopped as soon as he saw the crash.

In a statement read in court, the driver said he had spotted a male dressed in Gothic clothes and a ‘black coat’ in the road.

He added: ‘I realised this was not a black coat, but a woman. My wife and I got out of the car and went over to where she was. The male was very disorientated and seriously distressed.

Struck: At the split second Grace (above) stumbled, her uncle told police he said he had just spotted his niece and was about to try to catch her eye to wave

Praised: Grace was a ‘homebird’ with a ‘natural flair for languages’ and was talented at art, her mother said

‘There was no movement or sound from the lady in the road. Her body was sort of twisted. I spoke to the passenger who said it was his niece - I couldn’t believe what I had just heard. 

‘It didn’t look like she was going to survive. A while later I heard she had died.’

Recording a road traffic accident verdict, Assistant Coroner Mary Burke said: ‘No one could have anticipated that this was going to happen. No one could have changed the pattern of events. 

'It happened in fractions of a second. There was no way Jason would have predicted what was going to happen. I offer my deepest condolences to you.’

Grace’s mother Lydia Beaumont told the court her daughter was a ‘homebird’ with a ‘natural flair for languages’ and was talented at art. 

She added: ‘Grace and Jason were very close - they did everything together.’

After last August’s tragedy, Mr Booth wrote a tribute to his fiancee on Facebook, saying: ‘Life is unbelievably cruel at times, but everyone that ever met you will hold you in their memories as that crazy but absolutely lovable person that you were.

‘I could never thank you enough for the incredible memories you’ve given me, that I’ll forever hold tightly to me. I will be forever honoured and proud that I have your amazing self in my life.’
