Sir Bobby Charlton is adamant that Manchester United are at the start of an exciting and successful adventure under manager Louis van Gaal.

The club are without European football for the first time since 1982 and have failed to win any of Van Gaal’s first four competitive matches in charge at United.

However club legend Charlton, a director at Old Trafford, believes the good times are set to return imminently under van Gaal.

‘It seems strange that Manchester United aren’t involved in European football for a season,’ said Charlton at Soccerex. ‘It’s crazy but maybe it can make things easier for us.’

‘We’ve started with some new players, we’ve not been playing well but we will play well. I think that it’s going to be a great adventure of how we pull ourselves back round and get back to the way it used to be.’

Van Gaal has claimed his side will take three months to play the style of football he requires and Charlton is defiant that the Dutchman’s arrival will reap success:

‘He has given me and most of us fans some good news. We won’t struggle, definitely we won’t struggle any more.

It’s just such a strange environment the way that it’s all happened, that Manchester United is out of the news but it won’t be for very long.'

Van Gaal and Charlton will hope that United can pick up their first win of the season this weekend, when they host Queens Park Rangers at Old Trafford on Sunday.
