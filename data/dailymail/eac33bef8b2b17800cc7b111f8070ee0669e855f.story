Sunderland goalkeeper Vito Mannone has agreed a two-year contract extension at the Stadium of Light.

The deal comes despite the arrival of Costel Pantilimon, the towering 6ft 8in Romanian who's been Joe Hart's No 2 at Manchester City.

Mannone dismissed claims this week that he had handed in a transfer request following the signing of Pantilimon.

Rival: Reports in Italy suggested that Mannone was unhappy at the arrival goalkeeper of Costel Pantilimon

Suggestions
 came from Mannone's native Italy that he was unhappy following the 
Black Cats' capture of Pantilimon earlier 
this month and their impending battle for Gus Poyet's No 1 spot.

However, the 26-year-old, who 
established himself as a firm favorite with the club's fans last season,
 is in no mood to move aside.

He said in
 a statement: 'I don't know where this false speculation is coming from,
 but I want to let supporters know that there is absolutely nothing in 
it.

'I have not asked for a transfer and I have no intention of doing so. Why would I?

'I
 love Sunderland and the Sunderland fans. I enjoyed last season and am 
looking forward to next season, and hope we can reward the fans by 
winning something.'

Sunderland's

 out-of-contract keepers Keiren Westwood and Oscar Ustari left at the 
end of the season so reinforcement of that area was no surprise.Â 

Mannone welcomed competition for his starting spot.

He said: 'I welcome the arrival of another goalkeeper at the club. All big clubs need cover in all positions.

'The
 manager told me some time ago that he would be bringing someone else in
 because two keepers were leaving, but he also told me I am his number 
one, and that's good enough for me.'
