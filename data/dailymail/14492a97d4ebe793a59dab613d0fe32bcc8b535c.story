Javier Mascherano has admitted Barcelona had trouble 'behind the scenes' at the start of the year.

Barcelona's first game in 2015 ended in a 1-0 defeat against David Moyes's Real Sociedad with Lionel Messi starting on the bench following a reported disagreement with Luis Enrique in training.

But Barca are currently top La Liga after their win over Real Madrid on Sunday and Mascherano feels they are back to their best.

'We started the year with difficulties, with the defeat at Anoeta, which left us four points behind Real Madrid,' Mascherano told TyC Sports. 'Things weren't so good behind the scenes. 

'The team seemed to have doubts. But this situation has now disappeared. This is the situation we live in. The demands at Barcelona are massive and it's not easy to meet them.'

And Mascherano is refusing to rule out the threat that Real pose, despite their 2-1 win.

'Now we're four points ahead of Real Madrid. But this could always be turned on its head. The best thing is to always focus on the next game,' he said.

'Clasicos are difficult games, against opponents that push you to the limit, that are as good as our team. You need to try your hardest for every minute of the game, and that's what helped us to win. That's why we got the result we did.

'We're aware that we didn't beat Real Madrid with our best football. Barcelona always like to win, and especially to be better in a footballing sense, over and above the result.'
