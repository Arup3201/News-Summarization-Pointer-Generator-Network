Once thriving, a number of early 20th century theatres are now shadows of their former glory.

The ornate carvings and stunning architecture are still visible in many, but this is overshadowed by the state of disrepair that surrounds them.

US photographer Matt Lambros has made it his mission to document the sad decline of these entertainment venues.

The Paramount Theatre, located in Newark, New Jersey, like many others that thrived in the early 20th century, is now in a state of disrepair

Mr Lambros has visited 57 theatres across the United States and is not planning on stopping there. Here are pictures of the Eastown Theatre (left) in Detroit, Michigan, and the Loew's Kings Theatre in Brooklyn, New York (right)

This theatre, Loew's Palace, in Bridgeport, Connecticut, closed in 1975, just over 50 years after it opened in 1922

Many of the theatres are abandoned and crumbling, with peeling paintwork, collapsed ceilings and rolled-up, moth-bitten carpets.

Mr Lambros, 30, has visited and photographed 57 deserted theatres since he began his 'After the Final Curtain' project.

He now travels across the country looking for them, visiting one local theatre a month and planning longer trips twice a year.

Those at risk of being demolished are top of his priority list.

Eastown Theatre in Detroit, Michigan, is one of the many Mr Lambros has visited

Among those documented are the Metropolitan Opera House in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Paramount Theatre in Newark, New Jersey, and the Lyric Theatre in Birmingham, Alabama.

He also photographed the Embassy Theatre in Port Chester, New York, the Eastown Theatre in Detroit, Michigan, and Liberty Theatre in Dorchester, Massachusetts.

He said: 'I started photographing theatres after going to see a movie in the Village East Cinemas in Manhattan.

'As I was watching the movie, I found myself looking at the architecture of the theatre.

'Having grown up going to the movies in modern multiplexes, I couldn't believe they were showing movies in a place like this.'

Mr Lambros used to photograph abandoned buildings in general before developing a specialist interest in theatres.

'I started doing some research and started shooting them,' he said.

'I've gone to plays in working theatres before, but I never really appreciated the architecture until I started photographing the abandoned ones.

He added: 'Current condition, the original architect, accessibility and theatre size all come in to play when planning a shoot.'

Mr Lambros started photographing theatres after going to see a film and found himself looking at the architecture rather than the screen. Since, he has travelled far and wide, including to the State Palace Theatre in New Orleans, Louisiana

Mr Lambros has travelled to the Metropolitan Opera House in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the Paramount Theatre in Newark, New Jersey, and this, the Lyric Theatre in Birmingham, Alabama

Mr Lambros said he used to go to the theatre to watch plays but never truly appreciated the sort of stunning architecture seen here at the Proctor's Troy Theatre, New York

Mr Lambros is saddened by the level of disrepair at theatres such as the Paramount Theatre located in Newark, New Jersey

The National Theatre in Detroit, Michigan, which was opened in 1911 and closed in 1975, has certainly seen better days

Loew's Kings theatre in Brooklyn, New York, was the first Mr Lambros photographed and remains his favourite.

He described it as an 'amazing building'.

Mr Lambros, from Brooklyn, blames the decline of tradtional theatres in the rising popularity of huge multiplex cinemas.

He said: 'The rise of the multiplex combined with the downturn of some of the areas where these theatres are located contributed to their closing and state of disrepair.

'A lot of these theatres are out of sight, out of mind and I think my favorite thing about my photographs is that they help to remind people that these buildings still exist.

'When they view my photographs people are usually a bit upset that the theatres have been left to rot.'

Mr Lambros journeyed to Dorchester, Massachusetts, to capture images of this, the Liberty Theatre

The  State Palace theatre, located in New Orleans, opened 1926 but was closed due to flooding from Hurricane Katrina in 2005

This theatre, the Loew's Kings Theatre in Brooklyn, New York, is the first that Mr Lambros photographed
