A U.S. Marine was saved by his dog after it called 911 on his iPhone when he collapsed from a seizure.

Terry McGlade, from Zanesville, Ohio, who was injured when he was hit by an IED in Afghanistan, said his retriever-pit bull cross Major has been trained to help when he has a seizure.

Mr McGlade, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, said the dog managed to get the phone out of his pocket before placing his paw on the screen for several seconds, which caused it to automatically dial 911.

U.S. Marine Terry McGlade has said he was saved by his dog after it called 911 when he collapsed from a seizure

Mr McGlade said the dog managed to get the phone out of his pocket before placing his paw on the screen for several seconds, which caused it to automatically dial 911

Dispatchers sent help after receiving several calls from the dog, who then went to wait at the front of the house to take police and medics to his owner, ABC6 reported.

Mr McGlade said: 'I probably would have been in severe trouble if he wouldn't have called.'

Last month MailOnline reported how a Labrador-springer spaniel-cross called Judy had twice rescued her 61-year-old owner from death.

The first life-saving act was four years ago when Judy helped bring Sharon Brookes a Mars bar after she fell into a diabetic coma.

The latest occasion however was when Judy managed to dislodge a piece of toast from Miss Brookes's throat after she started choking in her home in Little Hereford, Ludlow, Shropshire.

Miss Brookes, who has had Judy since she was a puppy, said: 'There was nobody else in the house and I just thought that was it - I thought I was a goner. I wouldnâ€™t be here without her.'

Mr McGlade said Major has been trained to help when he has a seizure

Pensioner Miss Brookes was snacking on toast in her kitchen when a piece got stuck in her throat.

When she started to choke, her faithful dog knew something was wrong and jumped to the rescue.

Judy 'punched' Miss Brookes on the back and managed to dislodge the food.
