Rosemary Snell was buried by the landslide, along with a companion

A couple who lay entombed for 10 days 
under tons of mud after their car was buried by a landslide were not 
found sooner because it was a 'busy weekend', police said yesterday.

Rescue services closed a tunnel hit by
 a huge landslide unaware that Rosemary Snell and her companion were in 
their car crushed beneath the rubble.

There were fears that 67-year-old Miss
 Snell and her friend, a former hospital consultant named locally as 
Mike, could have lain trapped and unable to escape from the Beaminster 
Tunnel in Dorset.

Local councillor Ron Bond said yesterday he was ‘absolutely disgusted’ that the bodies had remained undiscovered for so long.

But Dorset Assistant Chief Constable 
James Vaughan claimed the couple’s deaths would have been ‘pretty 
instantaneous’ owing to the huge weight of the rubble.

Miss Snell, a former social worker and
 registered London tour guide, had only recently started a relationship 
with Mike, who was in his 70s, after retiring to the picturesque village
 of Misterton, Somerset.

The couple were seen in his silver 
Skoda Fabia on the afternoon of Saturday, July 7. Ivor Herring, 66, was 
tending his allotment in Misterton at around 4pm.

‘I recognised Rosemary in the 
passenger seat so I put my hand up and waved to her,’ he said. ‘She 
waved back at me. It was the last time I saw her.’

The couple are believed to have 
travelled to Beaminster and were returning to Misterton that night when 
heavy flooding caused an avalanche of several hundred tons of masonry, 
mud and trees which flattened their car as it left the tunnel.

Emergency services were called to the 
scene but left without clearing the mudslide as their heat-seeking 
equipment failed to detect any sign of movement.

The busy A-road had been closed to 
traffic since the landslide and was not cleared because emergency 
services and the council said they were dealing with numerous flood 
alerts in the area.

It was only when Miss Snell failed to 
keep a lunch appointment with friend and neighbour Carol Walker two days
 later that police began a missing persons inquiry.

They discovered that the couple had 
used a credit card in Beaminster on July 7 and eventually their 
inquiries led them on Monday to the tunnel, still beneath 6ft of rubble.

The weight of falling masonry from the bridge structure, soil and debris literally flattened the Skoda.

A police spokesman admitted officers had been busy after the public had inundated them with calls during the bad weather.

'There were 150 flood warnings in the 
county at that time, 180 homes had been evacuated, and 400 incidents 
reported to the police control room,' the officer said.

Tragic: Mrs Snell was finally found 10 days after the accident

He added: 'Members of the public may 
ask why it took 10 days to discover these bodies. I offer my condolence 
to the families of those that perished.

'It was a busy weekend, there are no 
obvious signs of a vehicle buried in the mud, there are several hundred 
tons of mud and rubble, and there are no reports of missing people in 
the area.

'The bridge had been secured safely, 
and it was only when concerns from Avon and Somerset Police were raised 
yesterday that we began to search, and the vehicle was discovered.'

Mr Vaughan said: ‘This was a tragic, 
freak accident. It was a chance in a million that they happened to be 
driving out of the end of the tunnel when the landslide swept through.

‘Their car was severely crushed – like being caught up in an avalanche of mud.

‘It will be up to the pathologist to 
decide exactly what was the cause of death, but I would have thought it 
would have been pretty instantaneous.

‘Dorset fire-and-rescue and police 
responded about 10.50pm on the evening of Saturday July 7 and the road 
was closed. At that time it wasn’t suspected that anyone was trapped.

‘Heat-seeking equipment was used at 
either end of the tunnel but nothing showed up. The tunnel was then 
closed off as it is an unsafe structure until it has been properly 
looked at by engineers.

‘A couple were then reported missing. 
By the end of last week the level of concern was such that police 
started looking at their telephone records and banking details.

‘It became clear the couple had gone 
to Beaminster. We brought in heavy machinery and began to excavate tons 
of mud and found the vehicle on Monday evening.’

Ron Bond, a member of Crewkerne County Council, said he was baffled how the bodies could have lain undiscovered for ten days.

He said: ‘I am absolutely disgusted. 
On the face of it it seems outrageous that somebody was in there for so 
long and that nobody looked.

‘The neighbours of the lady were 
concerned that they hadn’t seen her around and the police broke into her
 place and found there was no one there. She was a very nice lady and 
full of life. It is such a tragedy.’

Police sources say the body of a man has been removed and work is continuing to recover the second

Miss Snell had sold her house in 
Putney, south-west London, for £500,000 in April and had just finished 
renovating her idyllic £325,000 stone cottage in Misterton.

She had quickly integrated into village life – becoming vice-president of Misterton Women’s Institute and a parish councillor.

With interests in antiques, gardens 
and social history, she regularly gave lectures to the WI on subjects 
such as the Tower of London.

Floral tributes left at the scene. Flowers were placed on the ground along with a card from a local police officer

Gruesome discovery: The spot at where a couple were found buried in their car, as seen from the opposite end of the tunnel

Somerset county councillor John Dyke, who 
also lives in the village, said everybody was in shock at the news of 
her death.

‘She was very outgoing and really warm-hearted,’ he said.

‘Everybody thought she was wonderful – the whole village took her to its heart.

‘We are all in total shock. We just want to know why it took so long for her body to be found.

‘Surely they should have been looking 
in the mud sooner? We only pray she died instantly.’  The Beaminster 
Tunnel, which cuts through Horn Hill, was opened in 1832 and is the only
 pre-railway road tunnel still in everyday use.

It was closed for five weeks in 2009 for a major revamp which included strengthening the tunnel walls and new lighting.

Engineers discovered that steel mesh 
to the brickwork on the inside of the Grade II listed structure had 
rusted and the lining had detached.

The tunnel has remained closed since July 7. Dorset County Council said it may not re-open until September. This picture as taken from the opposite end to where the car was found

Attempts were being made to dig out the car today but the earth is still very soft and potentially dangerous following the recent bad weather
