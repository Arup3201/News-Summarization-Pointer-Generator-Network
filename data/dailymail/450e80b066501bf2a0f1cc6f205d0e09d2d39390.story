An office worker has told how her leather handbag was stolen from a suburban garden by a fox who chewed chunks out of it while she and her friends had a barbecue.

Izzy Lachowicz, 28, put her handmade bag on a table in her friend's garden in Tooting, south west London, while they all enjoyed dinner outside.

During the meal the friends saw a fox occasionally poke its head out of bushes and look at them, but thought nothing of it.

At the end of the evening Miss Lachowicz went to find her bag and realised it was gone.Â  It was only when she had another look around the garden in daylight that she discovered it, hidden behind the garden shed with large holes chewed in the leather.

She says the fox must have pounced midway through the evening when the friends went inside the house for two minutes to get more wine.

Miss Lachowicz, from Colliers Wood, south west London, who works at Absolute Sounds in nearby Raynes Park. said: 'We searched the house and the garden, but with no luck. I knew it hadn't been stolen so it was a complete mystery.

'I got a bit worried, because my house keys, work keys and bank cards were in it.'

'I had to stay at my friend's because I was locked out, and went to sleep very distressed thinking about changing locks in the house and cancelling all my cards.'

The following morning, Miss Lachowicz decided to check the 12ft-long garden one more time, only to discover her ruined bag behind the shed.

Ruined bag: Foxes are omnivorous and prefer to eat meat or scavenged food but also enjoy chewing leather

She said: 'It had big holes and teeth marks in it, and my wallet had some chew marks as well, though the fox hadn't touched anything else.

'It was quite annoying as the bag was handmade for me in Thailand so I can't get another.'

She says that since the incident, on July 9, her friends have reported a fox creeping into their house and chewing leather belts and sandals.'

Foxes are omnivorous and prefer to eat meat (including young animals) or food scavenged from bins, but are also partial to leather and rubber.
