Bomb: Vladimir Aust, 19, sometimes built detonators in Newcastle University's communal areas

A racist student who made explosives in his halls of residence and boasted he would 'whiten n******' with peroxide was jailed for two years yesterday.

Vladimir Aust, 19, used materials he bought on Amazon for just £22.

He watched videos on YouTube explaining how hexamethylene triperoxide diamine (HMTD) could be detonated and caused small explosions on four occasions.

He lied to staff after causing the fire alarm to go off, claiming it was caused by matches, and was found with a knuckle duster and captured on CCTV cameras throwing knives into a communal kitchen table. 

Police found the HMTD in six plastic boxes in his halls of residence in Newcastle.

Aust was arrested in London after the evacuation in June of a bus station and a language school at Newcastle University, where he studied.

He had mixed chemicals in his halls and built detonators, sometimes in communal areas.

Despite the evacuation, the university did not initially search his room and he explained away the incident by saying he had been lighting matches.

The foundation course student posted several racist slurs on a Russian social network, boasting about using peroxide to ‘whiten n******’. 

He also talked about how his explosions had left him deaf in one ear.

He wrote: 'I am f****** concerned to keep this s*** of mine it is f****** dangerous.' 

Jolyon Perks, prosecuting, told the court  HMTD was a 'primary explosive'.

'The weight of the white powder in the six Tupperware boxes was about 30-60 grams.

'He was a user of the VK website, a Russian equivalent to Facebook. Videos watched by him included igniting tissue with residue of HMTD.

'On the website he was complaining of ringing in his ears and how smoke he had caused in the room was a new record.

Equipment: Police searched his bedroom in his halls of residence and found an array of bomb-making tools

'The defendant was aware of the dangers of keeping HMTD as he referred to it as "f****** dangerous"'.

Richard Horwell, defending, insisted the case involved several misunderstandings.

'He did not know that it was illegal to make or keep HMTD,' he said. 'He was unaware of the danger. He believed it was safe to keep and store this explosive.

'The substance was in his room for many months and he slept a metre from it.

'None of the videos speak of the dangers of HMTD or any other explosive.

'The reference about how he should whiten n****** with peroxide, it is a remark from a film called I am Sky. It is a cult film and it is nothing to do with this offence.

'He was just 18 when he committed the offence. As a young boy he enjoyed playing with science kits and using his microscope.

'He worked on the explosives and detonates in full view of students and friends in the in front of the university CCTV camera.

'He wanted to cause safe, small explosions. There is not one piece of evidence of these causing any damage.

'This was just an interest, one interest among many. It was not in any way an obsession.'

But Mr Justice Coulson told Newcastle Crown Court  Aust was dangerous.

The court heard he had wanted to join the Territorial Army but was barred as a foreign national. He admitted one count of making explosives at an earlier hearing.

Aust, who was brought up in Moscow, received credit for his age, showing remorse and his previous good character.
