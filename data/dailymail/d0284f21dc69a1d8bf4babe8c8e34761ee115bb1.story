Emjoyment, pictured, matches job applicants to employers in a similar way to how Tinder matches people to dates

Finding a date and finding a job are two of the trickiest things to do.

The Tinder app already removes the hassle from dating by letting users simply click yes or no on other people's profiles - and now a startup has created a similar system for job hunters.

Called Emjoyment, employers and applicants can upload their details and search for the right match at the click of a button.

Users can either connect to the service using their LinkedIn page, or fill in their profile manually with education and work experience. 

They can then select whether they’re looking for full or part time work, or internships, as well as the kind of job they’re interested in.

At the moment, only employers from a select number of industries have signed up, and it's predominantly U.S-based firms, so the choices are a little limited.

Emjoyment users can also state where they currently work, and whether they’d be willing to relocate.

Finally, the site asks users to upload their CV before being shown relevant jobs.These preferences can be updated at any time, as can the user’s profile information.

Each job vacancy is displayed with the name of the company, the job title and a one-sentence description.

Applicants can then click the red 'thumbs down' button to reject a vacancy, or the green 'thumbs up' button to express an interest.

Employers can also look through the profiles of applicants to find suitable candidates. If a user finds a job that isn't suitable for them, but knows someone who it is suited to, they can click the purple people icon, pictured, to share the vacancy

Users can then click the red 'thumbs down' button to reject a vacancy, or the green 'thumbs up' button to express an interest.

Once
 an applicant has expressed an interest, the employer offering the 
vacancy can look at their profile and similarly click the red button to 
reject them, or a green button to accept.

If both the applicant and the employer accept they can arrange interviews and contact either other through the service.

The site’s creator posted on Reddit, under username Riedogreiley: ‘The reason for [Emjoyment] was simple - finding a job is a pain and you almost never find ones you actually want.

‘Because of this I developed a simple setup - a few questions about what your ideal job looks like and then use LinkedIn information for background and experience.

‘On the backend employers are doing the same to find appropriate matches. It's a new way to find jobs that you actually want and it's as easy as using Tinder.’

An alternative app, that works in a similar way to Emjoyment is Blonk, it lets users like or dislike vacancies, and employers can do the same with applicant profiles. 

The Blonk app is available for Android and iOS.
