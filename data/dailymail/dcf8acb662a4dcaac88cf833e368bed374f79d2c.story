A 30-year-old Swedish film has been banned in Australia for containing scenes of child nudity after an application by the federal police.

Children's Island centres on an 11-year-old boy who is coming to terms with the onset of puberty.

After its release in 1980, it won Sweden's most acclaimed award, the Guldbagge, and was the country's official selection for the 54th Academy Awards.

The Australian Classification board initially gave the film, directed by Kay Pollak, an R18+ rating after it was referred by the Australian Communications and Media Authority following a complaint last year.

But the decision was overturned by the Classification Review Board (CRB) after an appeal by the federal police, it was reported by The Sydney Morning Herald.

Members of the CRB ruled that a 49-second scene showing the boy masturbating - and a three-second close-up of his erect penis - was likely to cause offence to a reasonable adult.

Giving their decision, the board said: 'The review board considered that although the scene was relevant to the story and was brief in duration it is still the depiction of actual sexual activity by a minor and is not justified by context.'

Other sequences including a boy posing naked in front of a mirror were justified by their context, the board ruled.

The removal of the classification means that anyone buying, selling or showing the publicly could face fines of up to $275,000 (Â£150,000) or a maximum of ten years in jail.

Free speech advocate Chris Berg said it was a 'bizarre and rather extraordinary overreach' by the Australian Federal Police.
