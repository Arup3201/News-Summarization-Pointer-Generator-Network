'Never had a chance to say goodbye': Felicity Kendal has told how she regrets allowing her friendship with Richard Briers to fall apart

Felicity Kendal has told how she regrets allowing her friendship with Richard Briers to fall apart.

The veteran actor, her co-star in The Good Life, died before she had a chance to get back in touch.

Instead of being able to say goodbye to Briers when she heard he was ill, Miss Kendal's farewell came at his funeral just under a fortnight ago.

During the several years they worked together on The Good Life, she, Briers and the 1970s sitcom's other main cast members, Penelope Keith and Paul Eddington, formed a tight friendship.

It was, Miss Kendal recalls, a source of strength for her at a time when her private life was in turmoil.

But it seems the friendship faded over the years. In an interview yesterday, the 66-year-old actress admitted she found out about Briers's illness only when she read an article in the Daily Mail days before his death.

She said: 'I try not to do regrets – I think they're such a waste of time – but I now have one. Not having kept in closer touch recently with Richard Briers – or Dickie as I used to call him – is a real sadness to me now that he has gone.

'I was about to go abroad and determined to contact Dickie and his family on my return. It was not to be, as he died before I got back. That is my regret to deal with.'

Briers, who had been battling the lung condition emphysema, died last month aged 79.

Shortly before his death he gave an exclusive interview to the Daily Mail in which he told how Miss Kendal had not been in touch much during his illness and implied the pair had drifted apart after playing husband and wife Tom and Barbara Good in The Good Life.

'She seems to have disappeared in a strange way,' Briers said. 'She's an extraordinary girl. I don't really know who she is. Never did.

'She became enamoured with [playwright Tom] Stoppard. They were very much in love and I think she'd had enough of The Good Life.' 

Asked if they were friends, he replied: 'No, it's ridiculous. Strange.' However, Miss Kendal said in a Sunday newspaper: 'This lovely man was one of the funniest I have ever met and I loved him dearly.

'He taught me so much about the craft of comedy. He was generous to work with and was always beyond sweet and patient to me.

'At the time we worked together on The Good Life, he was also supportive of my complex and traumatic personal life.

'I had a failing marriage and an ill husband. While Barbara was all sweetness and light, my real life was far from that.

'But Richard cheered me on and made it possible to forget my troubles... and to plunge into the world of work. He was a real rock.'
