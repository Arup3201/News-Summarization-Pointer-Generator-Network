The Royal Commission has found that the Rudd Government should have done more to protect the installers that lost their lives due to the botched home insulation scheme, ruling that the deaths were 'avoidable' and the $2.8 billion program was 'poorly planned and poorly implemented'.

The reputations of former Labor ministers have been trashed in the report, according to the lawyer of one of the men who lost their lives.

Gold Coast lawyer Bill Potts represents the Barnes family, whose 16-year-old son Reuben died just 21 days after starting as an insulation installer, in November 2009.

Reuben was the second of four men who died working on the scheme before it was hastily shut down in early 2010.

Death of a teenager: Rueben Barnes was just 16 years old and was three weeks into his first job with a home insulation company when he was electrocuted laying batts in the ceiling cavity of a house in Stanwell, Queensland

Mr Potts says the royal commission report into the scheme, released on Monday, has trashed the reputations of senior Labor figures.

'It's been trashed for good reasons, because young men died and that should never have happened,' Mr Potts told reporters in Brisbane.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has slammed the pink batts scheme, an initiative from the Rudd Government.

'The report's findings are grave, and its recommendations are detailed. It details a litany of failures arising from a dysfunctional culture,' said Prime Minister Tony Abbott.

The report reveals that the scheme prioritised speedy work, which lead to crucial errors. 

Sufficient planning did not take place, nor were risks to installers identified or managed and training requirements were not met. 

Former prime minister Kevin Rudd took 'ultimate responsibility' for the disastrous scheme at a Commission hearing in May this year.

Mr Potts told the court that (Mr Barnes) was 16 years of age, he had been on the job for three weeks (with) almost no training whatsoever. Reuben Barnes' safety equipment was some sunscreen.'

He likened public servants rolling out the program to the crew of the Titanic.

'Too frightened, in essence, to call out "iceberg ahead". The reason for that is that they were told "get this done and get it done quickly",' he said.

Lawyer Aaron Anderson said his clients Kevin and Christine Fuller, whose son Matthew died under the scheme, would be pleased the report addressed a number of their key concerns.

'Kevin and Christine will be working closely with the commonwealth government to make sure these recommendations, particularly those that were causative of Matthew Fuller's death, are addressed in a timely manner,' he said.

Matthew Fuller, Rueben Barnes, Mitchell Sweeney and Marcus Wilson were the four installers who died during the roll-out, with hundreds of house fires breaking out before it was finally shut down in early 2010

Federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt promised to heed those recommendations.

'We are sorry for the errors that led to these tragedies. Nothing can bring these beautiful young men back but we can and we will learn the lessons,' he told parliament.

Mitchell Scott Sweeney, 22, seen here with his mother Wendy, was the fourth person to die in the insulation scheme. He was electrocuted on February 2, 2010 while laying sheeting in a home in Millaa Millaa

When asked if the families deserved compensation, Queensland Premier Newman said it was time to consider it.

'They've got every right to just feel so terribly wronged,' he told reporters in Brisbane.

'I think these sort of things now need to be looked at.'
