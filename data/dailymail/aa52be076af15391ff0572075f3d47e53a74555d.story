A car used as a Halloween prop - complete with a zombie driver - has been clamped by DVLA jobsworths.

The blue Vauxhall Astra estate was part of a gruesome mocked-up car crash on private land outside The Anchor, Darwen, Lancashire.

It had no engine, only one front wheel and a model zombie covered in fake blood in the passengers seat.

The Halloween prop was clamped by 'embarrassed' DVLA workers on Monday morning

Not a treat: Melissa and Lance Montgomery have been left dumbstruck by the DVLA's Halloween trick

Licensees Melissa and Lance Montgomery and their regulars were surprised to see the car being clamped by workmen from the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency.

The yellow immobilising device was put in place on Monday morning - but Lance said the wheel was not properly attached to the specially modified car.

The car was part of Melissa and Lance's typically elaborate Halloween display, which also featured boarded-up windows and a host of scary goings-on inside the pub.

Melissa, who has been at the pub for two years, said she was amazed when DVLA workmen turned up to put on the clamp.

She said: 'They seemed a bit embarrassed to be honest and I felt quite sorry for them.

'I offered to make them a cup of tea!'

A spokesman for the DVLA said the car was parked on public land

Licensee Melissa Montgomery said she offered the 'embarrassed' workers a cup of tea 

Stunned regulars could not believe their eyes and took to Facebook to voice their shock at what had gone on.

Martin Ainsworth said: 'I have just been to The Anchor to say hi to my friends Mel and Lance and see how they got on with their Halloween weekend and the DVLA have clamped the prop zombie car outside!

'They say it has no MOT. It has also got no engine and half the front is missing, because it's a Halloween prop on private property.

'Are these people actually serious?'

The Halloween prop has no engine, yet it was clamped by the DVLA on Monday morning

Paul Fisher said: 'Can't believe what I witnessed this morning while waiting for the bus outside The Anchor.

'Some jobsworth clamping the Halloween car. Shocking.'

A spokesman for the DVLA said the car did not have Statutory Off Road Notification and had been stickered three days previously.

Cars that have Statutory Off Road Notification (SORN) do not need annual MOT tests.

All cars that do not have SORN need to be taxed and insured.

A SORN can be lodged if an owner does not use or keep their vehicle on public land.

A SORN is valid until a vehicle is sold or scrapped, or it is taxed. 

He said DVLA agents are not allowed to lift a car's bonnet and there was no way of knowing the prop did not have an engine.

'The car was parked on public land and there was no sign or sticker to tell us it was a prop,' he said.

'On the face of it it was an intact vehicle. We've done nothing wrong.'

But Lance Montgomery said it was obvious that the car was a prop and that the clamped wheel was not properly attached to the car.

He also disputes the DVLA's assertion that the car was parked on public land, and said he did not know that the car had been stickered.

'As far as we're concerned the land is a part of our pub. It's not tarmacked' he said. 

'We've had tables and chairs there and nobody has complained before.'
