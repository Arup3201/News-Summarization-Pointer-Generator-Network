He is only 14 and too small to even see over the ledge of the dock when he appeared in court.

But a teenager admitted having two handguns and live bullets stashed under the floorboards at his home.

He had also been convicted of carrying a knife in the street when aged just 13.

However, despite these offences, he walked free when a judge said the law had ‘tied his hands’.

Judge Roger Chapple said his powers 
were ‘severely limited’ and he could not lock up the boy because he was 
not considered a ‘dangerous offender’.

He told the defendant: ‘If you were two years older, you would be facing a minimum sentence of three years’ detention.

‘Parliament has tied my hands almost 
completely. I have no power at all in the particular circumstances of 
your case to send you to any form of detention. There is really only one
sentence I can pass which is a youth rehabilitation order.’

The judge added that he could not even
put the boy under a more intensive supervision and surveillance 
programme because he was not a ‘persistent offender’.

The sentence at Inner London Crown Court prompted anger from campaign group Mothers Against Guns.

Founder Lucy Cope, 56, who lost her son Damian, 22, in 2002 when he was shot outside a nightclub, said she was shocked.

‘It is difficult to believe that something like this that puts more lives in danger could be dealt with so leniently,’ she said.

‘We want strong deterrent sentences. What message does this send? If you are 14 you can get caught with a gun and walk free?

‘The statistics show that more and more young people are being found with guns and this will not help to stem the problem.’

Detectives suspected the Italian and 
Russian pistols, along with 13 rounds of ammunition, were being looked 
after for older criminals involved in drugs and violence.

The court heard the haul was found in a
raid at the boy’s home  in Manor Park, East London, in August. 
Prosecutor Stephen  Clayton said the teenager claimed he was befriended 
by another boy in a local park who asked him to look after a package.

The defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons, thought it was cash but, after opening it, failed to call police.

The boy admitted two counts of possessing a prohibited firearm and one of possessing ammunition without a licence.

Seat of justice? Judge Roger Chapple told London Crown Court he was powerless to give the teen a custodial sentence

Sentencing him to the three-year order, Judge Chapple said: ‘You have a chance, please use it.

‘Do I need to emphasise how dangerous 
guns are? They kill people.  While a gun remains in criminal 
circulation, the risk is high that it is going to be used to commit 
crime, to kill or to cause serious injury.

‘Those who store guns keep them in the
hands of the wrong people. That is what you did and the courts 
generally take a very serious view of this sort of thing.’

He added ‘no court can be other than 
deeply disturbed’ that a  14-year-old with a conviction for possessing 
an offensive weapon at just 13 was found in possession of two handguns 
and ammunition.

The boy’s solicitor James Burley said 
he was not involved with gangs and hoped to be an engineer but had been 
excluded from school.

Anyone aged 18 or over caught with a gun must serve at least five years in prison.

Those aged 16 or 17 must serve at least three years.
