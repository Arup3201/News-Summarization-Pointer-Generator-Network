Siren: Glamorous style icon Kelly Brook is a fashion inspiration aged 33

THEY say fashion is a young person’s game, but many of us hang our heads in shame at the memory of the outfits we chose in our teens and 20s.

Now research has shown we become comfortable with our personal style only at the age of 33.

Before then, a lack of confidence or even trying too hard means many of us end up wearing clothes we will regret.

The study by M&S and Oxfam’s Shwopping Initiative shows women are least confident in their fashion choices aged 24.

It proved that inexperience led to fashion faux pas, with 40per cent saying they made most of their fashion blunders as teenagers.

That’s not to say the regrettable outfits were thrown away- 25per cent went on to reuse the outrageous outfits as fancy dress costumes.

And even with a strong sense of personal style, only 38per cent of us like and wear half the clothes in our wardrobe.

Rather than buying selectively, 48per cent sad they regret buying items of clothes just one week after they take them home.

Social media sites are now the port of call for fashionistas looking for inspiration, with 11per cent using Facebook and Instagram to learn about current trends and 21per cent of men following celebrity profiles for advice.

But the sites can also be a reminder of fashion disasters from the past, with 45per cent saying they have ‘de-tagged’ Facebook pictures because they’re embarrassed about the outfit they are wearing.

And a further 15per cent ‘de-tag’ photos because they don’t want to be seen in the same outfit twice.

Flares, shoulder pads and shell suits top the list of fashion disasters from the past that people have held onto.

Clothing choices differed between the sexes, with 40 per cent men wearing whatever is easy and comfortable and 33 per cent of women trying too hard to fit in with trends regardless of whether they suit them.

What to wear: 38 per cent of us only wear half of the items in our wardrobe. Flares, shoulder-pads and shell-suits are the questionable items people tend to hold on to
