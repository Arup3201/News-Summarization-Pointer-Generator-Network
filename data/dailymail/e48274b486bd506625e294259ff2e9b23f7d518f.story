Louis van Gaal admits two points from three games is not good enough for Manchester United and insists their problems lie in attack rather than defence.

United were held to a 0-0 draw at Barclays Premier League new boys Burnley to leave Van Gaal still searching for his first competitive win since taking change.

'I think we were the stronger team, certainly in the second half,' the Dutchman told BT Sport.

'In the first half we didn't play a passing game that we did in the second half much better. We have also created more chances, but then you have to score, we could have scored.'

Van Gaal has introduced a new system at Old Trafford, playing three centre-backs, and has been happy with how his players had adapted.

'We are not giving (away) a lot of chances, today in the first half maybe two and in the second half maybe two,' he said.

'In the games we played earlier, we didn't give a lot of chances away, but we have to create more chances and today we have created chances to score and that is where we have failed.

'The progress is there, but you have to win, a club like Manchester United have to win. When you have two points (out of) nine that is not good enough and that is disappointing.'

United had two penalty shouts turned down, but Van Gaal chose not to focus on them, instead saying: 'I think we had a lot of free-kicks against us and I am certain we had more ball possession so how is that possible?'

The Old Trafford boss added that he is hopeful that the work permit issues which have held up the transfer of defender Marcos Rojo will be sorted in time to allow the Argentinian to play in the next match against QPR.

He also admitted that Daley Blind will be arriving for a medical tomorrow and they will sign another player.

Van Gaal added: 'He’ll come to Manchester to have a medical, and then we might have a new player.'

Meanwhile, Burnley boss Sean Dyche was pleased to see his side get their first point on the board.

'I thought we were very productive first half, extremely productive against a very good side. Second half we started very brightly and as the game wore on they began to control it better and we just got on the back foot a little bit,' he said.

'Overall we are happy with a point, we can't be greedy, they're a very good side.

'I don't think there's a lack or organisation or energy to the team, it's that quality in the final third that wins you games and we were close again today.'
