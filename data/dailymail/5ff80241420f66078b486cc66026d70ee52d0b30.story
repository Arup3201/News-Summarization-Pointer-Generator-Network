'The most hated man on the Internet' is about to get his comeuppance. 

Hunter Moore, the self-proclaimed king of ‘revenge porn’ who gained notoriety by posting online stolen nude photos has agreed to plead guilty to federal charges of hacking and identity theft.

According to court papers filed Wednesday in Los Angeles federal court, 28-year-old Hunter Moore, of Woodland, now faces a sentence of two to seven years in federal prison and a $500,000 fine  as part of the plea deal.

Moore was dubbed the ‘most hated man on the Internet’ for sharing X-rated images and personal information about the people portrayed in them on his now-defunct site, IsAnyoneUp.com.

The term ‘revenge porn’ was coined because many of the images were posted by jilted lovers to get even with former partners.

Prosecutors said Moore, who once bragged that he was a ‘life-ruiner,’ also sought out racy content himself, enlisting a hacker to dig up nude photos from email accounts.

Photos posted between 2010 and 2012 included an American Idol finalist, the daughter of a major Republican donor and a woman in a wheelchair, according to a 2012 article in Rolling Stone magazine.

Moore acknowledged in the agreement with the prosecution that he paid Charles Evens to hack email accounts and steal photos.

Evens, 26, of Los Angeles, pleaded not guilty and is scheduled for trial next month.

Both Moore and Evans were arrested in January 2014 in an FBI sting operation. 

According to an indictment, on multiple occasions, Moore paid Evens to break into email accounts and steal nude photos.

In an October 2011 email, authorities say that Moore wrote to Evens that 'they needed to create new e-mail accounts and delete evidence of the hacking scheme.'

In other e-mails to Evens, Moore allegedly instructed him to 'hack more' and 'hack all week for me,' presumably referring to hacking into email accounts in search of nude photos.

Moore is due in court February 25 for a sentencing hearing, although U.S. attorney's office spokesman Thom Mrozek said the proceeding could be postponed until March.

Revenge porn has drawn the attention of lawmakers in several states who have passed legislation intended to stop the practice.

Prosecutors have brought a number of criminal cases against operators of revenge porn sites, some of whom have charged women to have their photos deleted.

Another revenge porn site Kevin Boellart, of San Diego, was convicted earlier this month of state charges of identity theft and extortion. He faces up to 20 years in prison.

In 2013, California Governor Jerry Brown signed the first law in the nation specifically targeting revenge porn. New Jersey has an older law that allows prosecution of revenge porn, but it was passed as a far-reaching cyber-bullying statute.

A revenge porn bill passed by Arizona lawmakers was put on hold last year by a federal judge after a rights group argued the legislation was too broad.
