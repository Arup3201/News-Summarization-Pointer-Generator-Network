Martin 'Mad Dog' Allen returns with the latest instalment of his new weekly column for MailOnline Sport. The former Gillingham boss does not hold back with his views on current issues in football.

This week, Mad Dog would be happy to see a return to standing terraces, says Arsenal look too lightweight for a serious title challenge, while West Ham remain in fine hands with Sam Allardyce but Swansea's dismissal of Michael Laudrup prove football is still bonkers.

I would love standing terraces to return.

When I was a little boy, many a Saturday afternoon and Wednesday night was spent stood on the South Bank at Reading's Elm Park.

A return: Standing terraces could be re-introduced in English football

The atmosphere, the banter, the singing, the humour, team spirit and camaraderie; people standing in the same position come rain or shine, proud and passionate to support their club.

Of course, first and foremost, in-depth research and studies must ensure there are adequate safety measures and lessons must be learned from tragedies in the past.

After the Football League clubs backed calls for safe-standing at Championship stadiums last week it moved a step closer to happening.

Atmosphere: Many believe a return to standing would improve the matchday experience

In Germany, all Bundesliga grounds have terraced sections and the atmosphere in the singing section is second-to-none.

There's no reason why it can't work over here.

Arsene Wenger will be concerned at how his Arsenal team folded at Liverpool.

When you compare Wenger's side now to the The Invincibles of 2003-04, they played similar fantastic football, but their two centre-backs of Sol Campbell and Kolo Toure and two centre midfield players of Patrick Vieira and Gilberto Silva were men made of steel.

Folded: Arsenal lack the mental strength and winning mentality to seriously challenge for the title

Collapse: Arsenal have crumbled when facing the best teams in the Premier League

They had a winning mentality and in the face of the fiercest storms they could go toe-to-toe and trade blows with the toughest opponents out there.

At the moment Arsenal are lightweight in that area and I doubt they can challenge for the top spot.

With their flair and quality technical players it will be another Champions League spot, which will be the 16th consecutive year for Wenger.

Silver lining? Arsenal still have more than enough talent to finish in the top four

Sack Big Sam?

Only a few weeks ago, people were clambering on the band wagon and all the critics, sat comfortably in their armchairs, were saying he should be sacked.

In good hands: West Ham will not be relegated as long as Sam Allardyce is in charge

Crucial: Andy Caroll's absence has weakened West Ham

The fact of the matter is, he didn't have his best players available. He was missing a whole back four and an outstanding centre forward.

People tend to forget this is only West Ham's second season back in the Premier League and this campaign they have kept 12 clean sheets – the most in the league.

There will be ups and there will be downs, but Mr Sullivan and Mr Gold should be commended for going against the grain and standing by their man.

Double: Kevin Nolan scored both goals in West Ham's 2-0 win at Aston Villa

In the last three games they have drawn away to Chelsea, beaten Swansea and on Saturday put another two past Aston Villa to move up to 15th.

It looks like they made the right decision.

Not even Swansea sacking Michael Laudrup after he won the club their first major silverware and led them into the Europa League.

If you look at the trends, teams that qualify for the Europa League often struggle to cope.

Surprise: Swansea sacking Michael Laudrup after he won the Carling Cup and lead the team into the Europa League was a surprise

In Germany the two teams who qualified for the Europa League are at the wrong end of the Bundesliga table. Eintracht Frankfurt are 12th and Freiburg are 15th, just one place above relegation.

In Spain Real Betis qualified for the competition and are bottom of La Liga.

Last season Alan Pardew's Newcastle had a torrid time coping with the extra games and the travelling. It led to injuries, fatigue, defeats, a negative feeling and the prospect of relegation.

Same treatment: Alan Pardew's Newcastle struggled last season because of European commitments but have been much better this season

After winning manager of the year in the previous season, people were calling for Alan's head.

Now they are out of that competition and their key players have been available, he's shown what a good manager at Premier League level he is.

At Swansea, Laudrup lost an outstanding player in Michu through injury.

He makes a difference and can change games.

Key man: Michu is a game change and his injury has affected Swansea

Stand in: Wilfried Bony has scored important goals but has not matched Michu's success last season

Although Swansea have excellent stats in retaining possession it was Michu's performances that would turn that possession into wins and points on the board.

Michu does not have a position to play in. He doesn't play centre forward, he doesn't play in the hole, but he drifts into areas where it's very difficult for him to be marked and opposition defences get pulled out of position allowing other players to break into space and cause problems.

He has blistering pace and quality technical finishing.

Losing this talent has clearly taken its toll on the manager.

Debut: Garry Monk won in his first match in charge at the Liberty Stadium

People have said he should not have gone to Paris for a two-day break after the West Ham defeat.

But all managers are under huge pressure and in my mind, to get away from it all, have the chance to clear his mind and freshen his body up, should not be criticised.

Looking at Laudrup from afar, it looked like the pressure had taken its toll and his own welfare is more important.

There's no doubt he will bounce back.

On Tuesday night I continued my search, watching non-League players and clubs, by going to Maidenhead United versus Weston-super-Mare.

It absolutely lashed it down at Maidenhead's York Road stadium, but the passion and commitment of all the players and the managers – who probably worked at their real jobs all day – and the supporters from both clubs made it a great occasion for me.

The players were all sliding into tackles, playing good football and I just love how humble and focused they were.

It annoys me when people forget where they come from. These types of clubs deserve more help from the Football Association and a share of the huge sums of money in the Premier League.

As the teams were about to come out after the half-time break, a song from Les Miserables was played at full blast in the dressing room of Weston-super-Mare.

Soaked to the skin, the hairs on the back of my neck stood up as I heard the inspirational piece of music.

Somebody had obviously given that a lot of thought and the players responded well by going on to win the game 3-0.

I've also been reading closely what's happened with Kevin Pietersen and the England cricket team.

The thing that strikes me is this: I have no idea, after the betrayal of his team-mates, his captain and the country, by sending text messages to the opposition's captain when they played South Africa, how Pietersen was ever allowed to wear the England shirt again.

To do what he did, behind Andrew Strauss' back, showed the real character and personality of an undeniably talented man.

There is a fine line between genius and madness. There's no doubt that Pietersen is a genius with a cricket bat, but this is a team game, not a one man, stand-up show.
