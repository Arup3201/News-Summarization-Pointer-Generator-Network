An Australian company with a revolutionary new building system has promised they can build their customers' dream homes from scratch in as little as six weeks' time with a revolutionary new panelling system.

Putting together an individually designed three bedroom, two bathroom, single story home under the new system will not only take a quarter of the time it usually takes to build a house, but also cuts both the costs of labour and everyday living, NU-TEK Building Systems' directors claim.

The time-saving and cost-cutting technology, designed by the privately-owned South Australian company, involves an instant structural panel wall system which makes up the home's frame, doing away with timber frames or brick veneer walls.

NU-TEK Building Systems in South Australia have designed a new panel system which significantly reduces the time and costs involved in building a new home from scratch 

The company claims an individually designed three bedroom, two bathroom, single story home takes only six weeks to put together 

NU-TEK's website explains that a 'steel structural edge beam [is] embedded in the edges of the panel' which allows them to fit together with other panels.

Each panel is also fitted with 100mm of PIR Foam and use a Magnesium Oxide composite, providing fire and termite resistance as well as acoustic and weather insulation.

NU-TEK marketing director Greg Toop, told the Advertiser that the technology will revolutionise the building industry and that he expects the business to boom into a $100 million a year industry within the next couple of years.

The revolutionary panels are fitted with steel structural edge beams which allows them to fit together

'It offers a new future for building in Australia, it's a reality, this is the future,' Mr Toop said.

'We started concentrating on houses, but we've found people want to use the product for a wide range of uses and so we believe there is no limit to the potential,' he said.

The design flexibility that is available for customers is part of the system's whole appeal. Not only are the panels available in any length, but buyers can choose any building material for each side of the panels – colour bond, cement board, wood, stainless steel and so on - with the option of having entirely different choices for the interior and exterior facing sides.

The panels also have flexible design options, with buyers able to choose the length and building materials of each side

Private housing and agricultural industries have both expressed their interest in the company's design 

This has led to a spike of interest from a variety of industries in the privately owned company, which has been the developing the panels for the last four years, according to the Advertiser.

Private housing and agricultural industries have so far contacted the company with requests and ideas. 

NU-TEK's website states that their demonstration homes have been assessed as having a 7.6 Green Star rating.
