Mehdi Benatia has revealed he turned down Manchester City and Chelsea to join Bayern Munich.

The central defender joined the German giants from Roma in a £20million deal last month after rejecting the Premier League duo.

The 27-year-old also spurned offers from Real Madrid and Barcelona and says he is very happy to be a part of Pep Guardiola’s squad.

‘Manchester City and Chelsea wanted me, while there were also approaches from Real Madrid and Barcelona,’ Benatia was quoted as saying by Kicker.

‘I discussed my future with Roma sporting director Walter Sabatini. He told me that the club wanted to hold on to me, but that they needed the money from a sale. That annoyed me, because I initially wanted to stay put.

‘But let it be clear, I was happy to join Bayern Munich. I like Munich – even if it’s a bit cold here.’
