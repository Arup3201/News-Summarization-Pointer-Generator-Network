A 'cursed' 2,500-year-old Turkish gold brooch which was illegally excavated has been returned home.

The winged seahorse brooch was part of the 7th century BC Lydian Hoard which is known in Turkey as the Karun Treasure.

Belonging to King Croesus, it was  originally looted in 1965 after being 
illegally excavated in western Turkey before being sold on, eventually to the New 
York Metropolitan Museum of Art.

According to Turkish folklore, all those involved in the looting of the burial hoards have suffered misfortune or violent deaths.

It was returned to Turkey in 1993 after a six year legal battle costing Â£25million, where it went on display at the Usak museum.

But the brooch on show was discovered to be a fake in 2006.

The
museum's director Kazim Akbiyikoglu was arrested along with ten others,
and he admitted to selling artefacts to pay off gambling debts. He was 
sentenced to 13 years in jail.

It will now finally take pride of place in a national museum after German officials agreed to return it.

Culture and tourism official Serif Ariturk told The Guardian: 'I am very happy to hear that the piece will finally return home.

'Since I was in office in 2005 and 2006, I felt personally responsible for the theft.'

Details of how the brooch has found its way back home this time are unclear.

Turkey repatriated some 885 artifacts in 2011 alone. But Usak's museum is able to display just a fraction of its 41,600 objects.

A larger museum to showcase the entire Karun Treasure is being built.
