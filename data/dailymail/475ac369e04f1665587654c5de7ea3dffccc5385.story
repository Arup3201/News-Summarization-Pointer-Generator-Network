Hair straighteners and styling tongs are responsible for nearly one in 20 cases of children needing hospital treatment for burns, new research shows.

This makes the gadgets one of the most common causes of burns in children.

The researchers behind the new study say warn that irons and hair straighteners are often left on the floor and retain a heat of 80C for six to eight minutes.

Hair straighteners are responsible for nearly one in 20 burns in small children - they can reach temperatures of 220C and take up to 40 minutes to cool down

Youngsters who grab or fall on them can suffer disfiguring injuries as their skin is up to 15 times thinner than adults.

Children make up half of all burns and 
scald cases seen in hospitals, with the potential for lifelong scarring,
 deformity and even death, say the authors. Nearly one in five had to be admitted to a specialist burns unit.

The new research, from the Archives of Diseases in Childhood, also revealed that babies are ten times more at risk of burns than older children.

Many infants scald themselves with hot drinks or food left within their reach - with the youngest victim being aged just eight months.

Researchers are warning parents and other family members to take care to move mugs of tea and coffee away from inquisitive tiny hands.

They can reach temperatures of up to 220C - hot enough to fry an egg.

They can take up to 40 minutes to cool down - this is much longer than most parents realise.

People often leave them on the floor where children can easily access them.

The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents suggests people follow the three Ss...

They found in children under five, 55 per cent of scalds were caused by a hot drink in a mug or cup.

Almost half of these were caused when youngsters pulled the drink on to themselves, causing burns to their faces, arms and upper body.

The study examined the burns and 
scalds of children admitted to five hospital emergency departments, a 
burns assessment unit and three burns units across the UK.

Researchers
 found that of 1,215 children almost three in five suffered from scalds,
 32 per cent had contact burns and the rest were burns from other 
causes, including sunburn.

Children under the age of one sustained 10 times as many burns and scalds as school-age children.

The youngest child to pull a hot drink over themselves was eight months of age, while the youngest child to climb into a bath of hot water was 16 months.

In pre-school children, the majority of burns were caused by youngsters touching hot items in the home.

Two in five such burns were caused by youngsters touching irons or hair straighteners and almost one in three were caused by touching oven hobs.

For those over the age of five, hot water was responsible for half of scalds, mostly from spills during food preparation, chiefly burning the front of the body including the face.

Hot drinks - such as tea and coffee - are the most common cause of scalds in children under the age of five

Study leader Professor Alison Mary 
Kemp, of the Institute of Primary Care and Public Health, Cardiff University, 
said: ‘Prevention is likely to rely upon heightened awareness and 
behaviour changes by carers.

'While
 these appliances must be kept out of the reach of children, there is 
the potential to explore modification to product design to ensure 
toddler safety,’ she added.

The
 study concluded: ‘Public information messages, children’s centres, 
health visitor or family nurse practitioners should address safety 
education as a matter of routine.’
