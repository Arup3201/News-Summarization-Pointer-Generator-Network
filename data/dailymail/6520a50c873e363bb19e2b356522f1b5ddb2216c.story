Illusionist: The video reportedly shows flamboyant entertainer Roy Horn groping employees

A graphic video allegedly showing flamboyant entertainer Roy Horn groping employees and squeezing their nipples is being offered for sale, it was reported today.

The illusionist, who was nearly killed by a tiger in 2003, is shown sexually assaulting three caretakers, according to website TMZ, which claims to have seen the video.

TMZ described the video as 'extremely disturbing' and reported that the men had filed a lawsuit against the entertainer, who made millions as one half of magic duo Siegfried & Roy.

Mr Horn has undergone extensive rehabilitation after he was mauled by a white tiger during a live show.

The film, shot in 2010, apparently shows the German-born illusionist assaulting a caretaker who was helping him to the bathroom.

He allegedly puts his hand on the caretaker's bottom and thrusts his own bottom into the man's crotch.

TMZ reported that, in two clips, the entertainer is seen grabbing the genitals of two male caretakers.

He reaches under the shirt of one of the caretakers and seems to tweak his nipples, at which point the man appears to writhe in pain.

Mr Horn is said to have whipped one of the caretakers with an oxygen tube.

He also manhandled one of the caretakers and forcibly kissed him on the mouth, the website added.

TMZ said the caretakers, who are all family men, were suing Mr Horn in a Nevada court for alleged sexual assaults.

Last September the Las Vegas Sun reported that Siegfried and Roy had been awarded $37,415 against attorneys who had been suing Mr Horn over unrelated sexual harassment allegations.

Attorneys for Oliver Preiss, a former personal assistant to Roy Horn, and for Preiss’s wife Beatrice were ordered to pay the money as a sanction for asserting 'baseless' legal claims against Mr Horn and a company owned by Siegfried and Roy.

Preiss made headlines in 2010 with a lawsuit filed in Clark County District alleging that he was fired by Mr Horn after rejecting the entertainer’s sexual advances.

Mr Horn was bitten in the neck by a seven-year-old male tiger named Montecore, who had been trained with Siegfried & Roy for six years.

He suffered severe blood loss and was said to have suffered a stroke and had to have a quarter of his skull removed to relieve pressure on his swelling brain.

Famous: Siegfried and Roy, pictured with Michael Jackson in 2002, were once named among the top ten highest-paid entertainers in the U.S.

He was also paralysed temporarily and had to undergo extensive rehabilitation in Los Angeles.

Siegfried & Roy, who were once named among the top ten highest-paid entertainers in the U.S., closed their show immediately after the accident.

They returned to the stage for a 'final stage appearance' with Montecore in 2009, but officially announced their retirement in 2010.

Mr Horn was unavailable for comment.
