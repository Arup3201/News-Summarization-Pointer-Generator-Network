Tattooed police officers in San Antonio are being ordered to cover up - or pay up. 

From the start of this month, the city's police department is ordering officers with visible tattoos that cannot be hidden to have the body art medically removed at their own expense.

The move is part of an effort to make police officers at the Texas department  appear more professional.

Police officers will be forced to pay for medical tattoo removals out of their own pocket

Officers with tattoos on their arms will be allowed to wear sleeves to keep the body art hidden, reports the San Antonio Express-News.

But those with inkings on their hands or necks that cannot be covered will have to shell out have them medically removed.

According to officials, the ban on visible tattoos is expected to affect around 200 of the department's 2,300 officers.

The San Antonio Police Department stopped accepting cadets with visible tattoos to the academy a year ago.

Police officers in Dallas and Houston are also banned from having visible tattoos. 

In Austin, officers with body art that is deemed offensive are required to cover the tattoos. 

Applicants to the Austin Police Department are required to submit photos of their tattoos as part of their background history.
