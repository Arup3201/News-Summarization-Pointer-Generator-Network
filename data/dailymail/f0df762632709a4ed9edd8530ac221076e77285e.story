Mars has never been seen as a particularly inviting destination, with its dust, mountains and almost monochrome appearance.

However, one software engineer used the latest in computer modelling to show us the red planet might once have looked like when there was an abundance of water - and it is remarkably Earth-like.

The incredible images show a lush, green Mars with cloud, greenery and oceans.

Mars reimagined an an earthlike planet: A New Hampshire software engineer manupulated real NASA data from the red planet to show it an an earth like planet

'This is a view of the Western 
hemisphere with Olympus Mons on the horizon beyond the Tharsis Montes 
volcanoes and the Valles Marineris canyons near the center,' Kevin Gill, a software engineer from New Hampshire, said of the above image.

He began the project using topographical data from Nasa to create a 3D model of the red planet.

'The resulting model was then brought
into GIMP (painting software) were I painted in land features using a NASA Blue Marble Next
Generation image for the source textures,' he said.

'There is no scientific reasoning 
behind how I painted it; I tried to envision how the land would appear 
given certain features or the effects of likely atmospheric climate.

'For example, I didn’t see much green
taking hold within the area of Olympus Mons and the surrounding 
volcanoes, both due to the volcanic activity and the proximity to the 
equator (thus a more tropical climate).

'For these desert-like areas I mostly used textures taken from the Sahara in Africa and some of Australia.

'Likewise, as the terrain gets higher or lower in latitude I added darker flora along with tundra and glacial ice.

'These northern and southern areas 
textures are largely taken from around northern Russia. Tropical and 
subtropical greens were based on the rainforests of South America and 
Africa.'

He then scripted the model to apply a three-dimensional cloud layer, add an atmosphere, and dampen specular lighting on dry land and under clouds.

However, Gill admits his model may not bee scientifically accurate.

'This wasn’t intended as an exhaustive scientific scenario as I’m sure (and expect) some of my assumptions will prove incorrect.

'I’m hoping at least to trigger the imagination, so please enjoy!'

Gill then used computer software to alter the colour of the images, to make them more 'earth-like'. He says he based the colours of similar geographical areas on Earth
