A struggling dog was dramatically rescued from a frozen lake after falling through ice into the numbingly cold water.

By the time the emergency services 
arrived at the scene, the dog, named Huckleberry, had stopped moving and
was clinging to the edge of the ice.

The golden retriever was spotted by a neighbour, who raised the alarm yesterday morning in the coastal town of Westport, Connecticut.

Rescue: Firefighter Toby Ostapchuk jumped into the icy lake to save golden retriever Huckleberry

Struggling: The dog is likely to have been suffering from hypothermia when emergency services arrived

Firefighter Toby Ostapchuk told ABC 7
that it was obvious from the way the dog was so still that the animal 
had been there for a while.

It is likely that Huckleberry was suffering from
hypothermia and that its body was shutting down, but it is not known how long the animal had been in the water.

The firefighter jumped into the water
and said he tried to keep the dog calm by making it clear to the pet 
that he was there to help him.

It
is thought that the dog, who lives with a family close to the pond in 
Hale Road, and may have run off after becoming startled by a tree 
falling down in the garden during heavy wind and rain.

'Grateful': Huckleberry's owners feared their dog was moments away from going under the freezing water

Rescue: Huckleberry has since returned home and has not suffered any injuries from his ordeal

The pet's owner said: 'I'm glad somebody spotted him. By the sound of it, he would have gone under and that would have been the end of Huck.'

The firefighter's saved Huck by pulling him to the edge of the pond and then lifting seven stone dog out of the water.

Ms Frey added: 'We're so grateful he was prepared to jump into the freezing cold water.

'I know it's kind of dangerous so maybe we will go down to the firehouse tomorrow to give him a special thanks.'

Huckleberry has since returned home and has not suffered any injuries from his ordeal.
