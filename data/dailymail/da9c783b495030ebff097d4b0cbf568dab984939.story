Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell has slammed Mama June for bringing the man who molested her as a child into contact with her two younger siblings, Honey Boo Boo and Pumpkin.

'It's Mama's fault!' Anna said through tears in an exclusive interview with Entertainment Tonight that will air on Thursday. 'She has to live with it. She brung the past back.'

The emotional interview comes after photographs emerged showing June Shannon with Mark McDaniel, 53, who served 10 years behind bars for sexually abusing Anna when she was just eight.

'I feel betrayed,' Anna told ET correspondent Nischelle Turner. 'He did this to me. Why would you let him come around the girls, knowing what he did?'

Devastated: Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell sobs in the arms of Entertainment Tonight correspondent Nischelle Turner as she talks about how hurt she is that her mother has been seen with her molester

Distraught: Anna, who will appear in the interview on ET on Thursday, was sexually abused when she was eight

She added that she now fears for her sisters, nine-year-old Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson and Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon, 14.

The interview comes after a police report revealed that Pumpkin was forced to watch as Anna was sexually abused by McDaniel - then her mother's live-in boyfriend - in 2002.

According to Spalding County Superior Court documents obtained by RadarOnline, Lauryn was just three when she witnessed McDaniel attacking her sister, then eight, on at least one occasion.

'Anna…stated that her sister, Lauryn, is in the bed with them when this is going on,' the report noted.

For her part, Lauryn has taken to her Instagram page to slam what she calls 'false' stories.

Anger: Anna is a married mother-of-one and has said her mother is not allowed contact with her daughter

But the police report from 2003 shows how, after revealing the abuse to her elementary school teacher in 2003, Anna told the officer that McDaniel molested her in June's bedroom while she was at work.

She told authorities that she had done the 'S word' with Mark McDaniel, the report shared by RadarOnline reveals.

She also told police that her mother's boyfriend touched her inappropriately, made her touch him inappropriately and forced her to perform a sex act on him. When she told him to stop, he would not, the grand jury heard.

The molestation was carried out multiple times between April and October 2002, according to the report. 

It took Anna months to speak out about the abuse because McDaniel had threatened to kill her if she told, RadarOnline reported.

'Anna stated that Mark told her not to tell because he would not like her anymore,' the police report said. 'Anna advised she got tired of holding it in and had to tell.'

Sickening: Mark McDaniel, pictured, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for child molestation. Anna said he repeatedly abused her in 2002 and threatened to kill her and her family if she told anyone

Back in her life: Mama June is pictured beside her nine-year-old daughter Alana, also known as Honey Boo Boo, and her former boyfriend Mark McDaniel (back), who was jailed for assaulting her older daughter

Speaking to the National Enquirer in 2012, Anna's ex-boyfriend added: 'Anna told me that McDaniel threatened that if she ever told her grandparents what happened to her, he’d kill them and her.'

In June 2003, McDaniel was indicted for child molestation, aggravated child molestation and aggravated sexual battery in Henry County but the case was soon dropped. 

Denial: Lauryn 'Pumpkin' Shannon, 14, has denied that her mother has been seeing McDaniel again

He was then indicted in Spalding County for rape, child molestation, aggravated child molestation, enticing a child for indecent purposes and aggravated sexual battery. 

McDaniel was sentenced to 10 years behind bars after pleading guilty to child molestation. He left prison in March and has reportedly been seeing Mama June again. 

Earlier this week, Anna revealed to People magazine that when she told her mother what McDaniel had done to her, June did not believe her.

'A week or so after it happened, I talked to Mama and she was upset, crying and saying, "I don't believe you, I don't believe you, why would you do this to me?"' she remembered.

'And I was like, "Mama, he did that to me and I can't do anything about it. You were never there to see it. You were always at work".' 

Anna, who appeared on 'Here Comes Honey Boo Boo' before TLC canceled the show in light of the allegations that Mama June has let the pedophile near to her children, is now married with a two-year-old daughter. She said she will not let the couple near her child. 

Mama June has denied that she is dating the child molester.

'The statement of me dating a sex offender is totally untrue,' she said in a video posted at the weekend. 'I would not ever, ever, ever, ever put my kids in danger.' 

But photographs have emerged showing June and McDaniel looking for houses in Griffin last month, while another image shows him touching her daughter, Alana, who is just nine. 

Despite Mama June's protests, TLC has announced that they were cancelling the series because of Shannon's relationship with McDaniel. 

Moving on: Anna, left with her husband and right with their daughter, said she is hurt by reports that her mother could be back together with her abuser - and that they will not be allowed to come near her child

And a friend of Alana's father, Mike 'Sugar Bear' Thompson, told MailOnline that he is gearing up for a custody battle after learning that Mama June has allowed McDaniel to come into contact with her.

McDaniel is not the only sex offender she has dated.

She also went out with Michael Anthony Ford, 37, the father of her 17-year-old daughter Jessica 'Chubbs' Shannon.

After the pair split, he served more than two years in prison for the sexual exploitation of a child over the internet in 2005 and remains on the sex offender registry.

According to prison records, Ford is currently behind bars on a separate child abandonment charge.

The fathers of Shannon’s other children also have criminal records but rather than being sex-related their crimes included arson and burglary.
