An emaciated one-year-old sea lion that was probably looking for food was rescued along a major San Francisco boulevard, more than 1,000 feet from the ocean. 

The young male had dragged himself uphill, through shrubbery and over the busy road before being discovered Wednesday by two motorists,The San Francisco Chronicle reported.

A park ranger driving through the area stopped to help and took the animal to the Marine Mammal Center in Sausalito, where the ranger named him 'Percevero,' which mean perseverance in Latin.

Officials say the sea lion weighs 28 pounds instead of a normal 80 pounds.

Hundreds of sick and starving sea lion pups and yearlings are turning up on California beaches and 1,500 have washed up since 2013.

But wildlife officials say it remains unclear what's separating the animals, who should be nursing, from their mothers. 

Spokesperson for the Marine Mammal Center, Yvette Koth, said:'These pups come in very underweight and malnourished.

'Just in the last 10 days we've gotten 100 pups in. Normally during this time of the year, we should see any lion pups at all because they should be nursing in the Channel Islands.' 

Some researchers believe this might be happening due to fish moving further from sea lion breeding grounds - causing mothers to abandon their offspring to look for food.
