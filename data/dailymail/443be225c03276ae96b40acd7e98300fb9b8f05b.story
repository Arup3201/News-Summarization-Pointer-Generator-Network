A Philadelphia cop accused of punching a 14-year-old girl has been arrested and now faces multiple assault and child endangerment charges.

Officer Tamika Gross, 35, reportedly has a history of fighting and even allegedly pushed her own children to engage in brawls with other kids.

Her violent history has been detailed by the Philadelphia Daily News, including a 2009 street fight with another woman while on duty and an incident in 2013 when she brought her suspended 16-year-old daughter to Lincoln High School to fight a 14-year-old girl in an argument over a boy.

Authorities have arrested Philadelphia police officer Tamika Gross and charged her with assault and other crimes over several fights involving her teenage children

Prosecutors claim the second incident was caught on video and that Gross inserts herself in the fight when her daughter begins losing then punches the 14-yeard-old twice in the eye. 

The unnamed victim's mother, Tashiana Haggins-Montgomery, said the she's been calling the D.A.'s office every week since the incident to follow the case's progress. 

'I honestly thought it was going to be slipped under the rug,' the concerned mother. 'She's been getting away with it so long it was almost like it was
 the norm for her.'

Gross has now been charged with 11 counts in three different cases with the oldest dating back to 2012.

In that case, she allegedly demanded her son, 18, fight a 16-year-old boy, resulting in a street brawl.

In another case later that year, Gross is alleged to have forced her daughter to fight two sisters, ages 13 and 17, while yelling that as she was an off-duty cop they didn't have to worry about going to jail.

She faces two counts of simple assault, four counts of recklessly endangering another person, four counts of corruption of minors, and one count of endangering the welfare of a child.

'I'm happy that it won't happen to another child, even if she doesn't
 do jail time at least they're watching her,' Haggins-Montgomery told reporters. 'My child was not the first, she might not have even been the third.'

The police department has documented Gross' long history of violence, according to internal documents.

One investigator wrote in a 2012 report: 'Police documentation reveals P/O Gross was in fact present on more 
than one occasion when groups of juveniles gathered for the purpose of 
provoking fights with each other.'

The department has suspended her with intent to dismiss.

Gross also has an open complaint filed against the city in 2013 alleging sexual harassment and a hostile work environment.
