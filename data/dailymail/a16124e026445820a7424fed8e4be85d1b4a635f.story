A revealing new map has made it clear where hundreds of hate groups are based in the United States, showing how racist and radical groups are still largely found in the South but the number of groups has multiplied  dramatically since President Obama too office.

The Southern Poverty Law Center has released a 'hate map' last week which shows the national distribution of the various groups that they could confirm.

The overall number of groups actually dropped from 1,007 in 2012 to 939 in 2013- the last full year with available data- but one of their more troubling observations is that some of the far-right leaning groups have had their ideologies picked up by conservative Republican politicians.

California has the most hate groups with 77 in the state but the majority is still largely found in the southeast of the country

Growing trend: The number of hate groups jumps during Democratic administrations but particularly during that of President Obama

‘The idea that the Muslim Brotherhood has
 infiltrated the Department of Justice and the Department of Homeland 
Security, among others, is being plugged by U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann 
(R-Minn.). Last November, U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) suggested 
the president was using the Affordable Care Act as cover to set up a 
“secret security force,”’ the report states.

‘Earlier in 2013, U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Texas), echoing many Patriot groups, falsely claimed that a proposed United Nations arms treaty “set the stage for [gun] confiscation on a global scale.”’

The SPLC, which focuses much of its work combating racist groups, said that the lack of clear legislative victories for the Obama administration on gun control in the wake of Sandy Hook and the upcoming immigration reform battle appear to have effectively calmed some of the far-right groups.

‘Those factors, along with the 
collapse or near-collapse of several major groups for a variety of 
reasons, seem to have taken some of the wind out of the sails of the 
radical right, leaving the movement both weaker and somewhat smaller,’ 
the report states.

Many 
states have varying bands of hate groups, but for their map, the SPLC 
qualified them into eight categories: black separatist, neo-confederate,
 Christian identity, racist skinhead, white nationalist, neo-Nazi, Ku 
Klux Klan and general hate.

There
 is only one state- Hawaii- that has no known hate groups but a vast 
majority of the rest can be found below the Mason Dixon line.

The
 11 states that make up the area between Texas and the Atlantic are home
 to 589 of the 939 active groups that the SPLC identified- a whopping 
nearly 63 per cent.

Though Florida hosts 58 groups and Texas has 57, they do not take the top slot this year.

California
 actually made the top of the list, which comes as a bit of a surprise 
given the large immigrant population in the state and the fact that 
unlike the South, it does not have a history of slavery.

Face of the uprising: Members of the National Socialist Movement are seen at a rally near Los Angeles, and like many far right groups, they are campaigning against immigration

Dropping slightly: The number of groups in the U.S. dropped from 1,007 in 2012 to 939 in 2013

The
 California-based American Freedom Party that was originally founded by 
racist skinheads group in Southern California is one of the top two 
groups that the SPLC have flagged up as particularly threatening.

They have stepped up their rhetoric against immigrants and in support of 'the interests of white Americans'.

'They
 have for years, been running in political elections and haven't done 
all that well. They have however, recently gathered the top influential 
white supremacists to run their board and are becoming more aggressive 
about winning elections,' the report's author Mark Potok told Business 
Insider.

The other group 
that has been cited as a cause for concern is Crew 41 which started 
online. They take aim at sex offenders and members of a South Carolina 
outpost allegedly shot and stabbed a middle aged couple after finding 
out that the husband was a registered sex offender.

The trail of hate then returns to the south with Georgia, which has 50 known groups.

From
 there the next portion of the list is found in the Northeast, with 44 
groups in New Jersey, 42 in New York and 41 in Pennsylvania.

The
 geographic composition of the map also shows how the groups tend to be 
found in or around cities. For instance, all but nine of New York’s 42 
hate groups are found in and around New York City.

Mr Potok, said that the ideas behind the group also plays a role in their location.

'Another
 thing to consider when analyzing this data is that certain hate groups 
reside in particular areas. The Klan will almost always be in rural 
areas whereas, the Black Separatists are mostly in the cities,' Mr Potok
 told Business Insider.
