An expectant mother took a picture of herself every day of her pregnancy to create a time-lapse video that speeds through her trimesters in just 90 seconds. 

The festive-themed video was uploaded to YouTube on Christmas Day to celebrate the arrival of her newborn daughter with the caption: 'She has arrived. It's a Christmas miracle.'

The unidentified woman continues: 'I hope this video teaches women all over the world that pregnancy is something very beautiful and magical. Have a blessed 2015 everyone!'

At the beginning: The mother-to-be holds up a finger to indicate day one of her pregnancy and then stands side on to show her slim figure

Deep breath: The woman then starts inhaling a blown up balloon in the time-lapse clip

As a version of 'Let It Snow' by Danielle Celeste is played, the mother-to-be is pictured in front of a white wall wearing black leggings and a black top. 

She turns to stand side on, showing her slim figure and holding up one finger to indicate day one of her pregnancy.

In a quirky twist on other pregnancy time-lapse videos, she is then seen holding a blown up balloon.

She then inhales the balloon and as it shrinks, her baby bumps grows. 

Expanding in seconds: As the balloon shrinks, her baby bump grows

Ready to pop: By the time the balloon is empty, she is in her final trimester

The mother said of the video: 'I hope it teaches women all over the world that pregnancy is something very beautiful and magical'

In a matter of seconds, she holds an empty balloon while cradling her expanded belly.

She then turns away from the camera and when she faces it again, she is holding her newborn daughter in her arms.

The video clip has already received more than a million hits on YouTube after it was uploaded to the account James' World. The name, age and location of the mother is not revealed.

A number of comments can be seen congratulating her on the birth of her daughter while others poke fun at how it will make children question whether you can really have a baby by inhaling a balloon.
