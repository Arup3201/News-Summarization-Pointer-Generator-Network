Not installing anti-virus and security software on new devices such as laptops and mobiles means that almost half of us are at risk from cyber attacks.

That is the view of the National Crime Agency (NCA), which is launching a new campaign to increase awareness of the dangers of not protecting yourself online.

The campaign is calling for internet users to be 'cyber streetwise' and take steps to better protect themselves. The initiative is being led by the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU) in partnership with a Government campaign.

According to the Office of National Statistics, there were more than 10,000 victims of computer viruses in the UK last year, with most being preventable had adequate security software been in place.

The new campaign wants to improve cyber common sense and cut down on the amount of security breaches that occur from opening malicious emails or using infected USB sticks - both of which are cited as common issues among web users.

Jamie Saunders, the director of the NCCU, said: 'The internet is a great place to explore the world and do business, and the majority of people won't experience any problems. But for the minority who leave themselves unprotected, not downloading and updating their security software can be very costly.

'It's tricky to put exact figures on the cost of cyber crime to the UK and the number of people who don't protect themselves, but what we do know is that far too many people continue to put themselves and others at risk online.

'However, the cost to individuals not only hits their pockets but also their personal and family life, which is why it's important that everyone takes steps to protect their computer, tablet and mobile.'

The NCA is offering four key tips to users in order to improve web security; encouraging users to install security software, not open emails from unknown sources, take caution with USB sticks and CDs, and buy software from legitimate sources only.

The year 2014 has seen a series of high-profile cyber security issues, including the Heartbleed bug that affected the encryption and protection of personal data online, as well as the hacking of eBay's servers that saw passwords and user names compromised.

These incidents have increased the focus on web security, particularly when paired with NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden's continued calls for users to do more to protect data from government snooping, as well as hackers.

According to statistics, almost 40 per cent of adults rarely install or update the security software on new devices, leaving them at risk. It is these sort of statistics that have prompted this initiative, say the Government.

Organised crime minister Karen Bradley said: 'The internet has radically changed the way we work and socialise, but cyber crime now poses a serious threat to the UK, and the Government has taken action to transform the way we respond.

'Through the National Cyber Security Programme, we have dedicated £860million over five years to make the UK one of the most secure places in the world to go online. The NCA works with police forces to pursue those involved in criminal activity.

'This campaign, which draws on the NCA's experiences in fighting cyber crime, sheds light on some of the ways in which malware can operate. But it also shows there are a few simple steps that we can all take to reduce the chances of falling victim to cyber crime and ensure we can keep enjoying the benefits of the internet.'

However, Professor Ross Anderson of Cambridge University  Computer Laboratory is highly critical of the security industry that has grown up around so-called cybercrime.

Prof Anderson believes that attempts to regulate the internet are doomed to fail and are a waste of time and money.

In 2011 a report was issued claiming that the UK was losing £27billion a year to cybercrime.  Prof Anderson and his colleagues decided to carry out an investigation into the real cost of cybercrime to the state, businesses and citizens.

Their report completely demolished the official figures and found out that the cost of fighting cybercrime was greater than the cost of the crimes themselves.

Prof Anderson said that true cost of cybercrime to each citizen is about £1 a year while the cost of fighting crime is more than £10 each a year. 'Almost all the cost of cybercrime is the cost of anticipation,' he added.

Apache web-server guru Ben Laurie, the pioneer of SSL – the 'secure sockets layer' that keeps web transactions secure, decries the use of anti-virus software, which he says 'doesn't really work, It has a high false negative rate .'
