Social media users seem more interested in the mysterious single informal vote than the actual outcome in the leadership spill motion that has kept Prime Minister Tony Abbott in a job for another day.

Mr Abbott got over the line in this morning's Liberal leadership ballot gaining 61 of the votes to remain in the top job - leaving 39 of his colleagues wanting a leadership contest to go ahead.

However, it was the solo informal vote that had Twitter followers talking about what might have been scribbled on the ballot paper with suggestions that American pop sensation Taylor Swift and Socceroos coach Ange Postecoglou could have scored a vote.

A paper fortune teller also made the list of suggestions for what the informal vote may have said

The imaginations ran wild for Twitter followers about the possible contents of the ballot paper

Singer/songwriter Swift received numerous mentions suggesting that the informal voter may have referred to her smash hit single Shake it Off.

While a football fan was 'fairly certain' that Australia's National Football coach Postecoglou got a score on the board adding: 'understandable #inAngewetrust'.

One follower suggested that Christopher Pyne voted for himself while another said that the Education Minister was to sad to vote in the spill motion.

Did Education minister Christoper Pyne vote for himself or was he simply just too sad to vote at all?

It was also suggested that Tony Abbott voted for himself saying: 'You bet you are. You bet I am'

There was also speculation that the Prime Minister voted for himself.

'He wrote 'you best you are - you bet I am' on his voting slip,' Rhett Bartlett posted.

David Pope hedged his bets by posting a ballot paper with both boxes ticked and then scribbled in red crayon 'Cory 4 PM' alluding to controversial Liberal MP Cory Bernardi.

Moni Bennett posed the question: 'can you repeat the question?' and then quoted the lyrics from the Malcolm in the Middle TV show's theme song by by the band, They Might Be Giants.

'You're not the boss of me now and you're not so big,' the post said.

Further humorous suggestions were scrawlings of male genitalia, a paper fortune teller and even a picture of a cute smiley black spider was snuck in there.
