Manchester United trio Radamel Falcao, Juan Mata and Marcos Rojo were given a freestyling lesson by a mystery trickster who goes by the name of the Red Samurai.

Summer signings Falcao and Rojo were joined by Mata in watching the Red Samurai perform a number of tricks before showing the costumed character what they could do.

Mata juggles the ball on his head before passing it onto the Red Samurai while Falcao's most notable skill sees him hold the ball up in the air with his right foot before switching it to his left.

Manchester United's loan summer signing replaced Spanish midfielder Mata

Mata scored Manchester United's fourth goal against Queens Park Rangers to complete his side's rout

Former Sporting Lisbon defender Rojo also made his Manchester United debut at Old Trafford

Manchester United have released the promotional clip in order to entice their fans to upload videos of themselves performing tricks.

Falcao, Mata and Rojo will be full of confidence having been involved in Manchester United's emphatic 4-0 win over Queens Park Rangers on Sunday.

Mata, who grabbed his side's fourth goal, and Rojo both started the game while Colombian international Falcao came off the substitutes' bench in the 67th minute to make his Premier League debut.

Falcao will be hoping he can edge his way into Louis van Gaal's starting line-up to face Leicester City at the weekend, while Rojo could partner Jonny Evans at the heart of Manchester United's defence if Luke Shaw is given the nod to make his competitive bow for his new club.
