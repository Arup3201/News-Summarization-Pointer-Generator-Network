Nick Clegg has ordered a team of senior Lib Dems to start drawing up plans to remain in power after the next election.

With more than a year to go until polling day, Mr Clegg named a team of five MPs and peers who he hopes will be able to secure his place as Deputy Prime Minister for another five years.

Lib Dems hope the negotiating team will prevent a repeat of the catastrophic ditching of the party’s flagship pledge to scrap tuition fees, but Labour said the move proved how ‘arrogant, delusional and out of touch the Lib Dems are’.

Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg has appointed a team of five people to help negotiate him back into power in 2015

A new opinion poll shows that support for coalitions is beginning to rise again, with both the Tories and Labour fearing they could fall short of an overall majority in 2015.

Downing Street was last week forced to play down suggestions David Cameron was planning to rule out another coalition in the Tory party manifesto.

Labour has also insisted it is battling for a majority, while making overtures to the Lib Dems should they need a power-sharing deal.

Mr Clegg told his party’s MPs that he has asked Danny Alexander, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, to head up the group of MPs and peers who will hold talks in the event of another hung Parliament in 2015.

It is a similar process to what happened ahead of the 2010 election, when Mr Alexander also took part in Coalition negotiations and ended up pairing with the Conservatives.

The move shows that Mr Clegg would accept overtures from both the Tories and Labour if neither of the main parties achieve an overall majority.

Mr Clegg wants to recreate the success of the last negotiating team, which included D(left to right) David Laws, now schools minister, Danny Alexander, Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Chris Huhne, who was jailed, and Andrew Stunell, who is standing down at the election

Mr Clegg said: ‘The Liberal Democrats will fight the next election as a strong, independent party.

‘Though, like last time, we do not take any outcome of the next election for granted and so we want to be prepared for any eventuality.

‘By preparing well, we will ensure that the Liberal Democrat Party is best placed to deliver a stronger economy in a fairer society in whichever circumstances we find ourselves in.‘I remain of the view that the worst outcome next year would be either a Conservative or Labour only government - because only the Lib Dems can anchor the country in the centre ground.’

The Lib Dem leader made his announcement at the weekly meeting of the parliamentary party in the Commons last night.

Along with Mr Alexander, the team will be made up of Baroness Brinton, from the party’s federal policy committee, aid minister Lynne Featherstone, education minister David Laws and pensions minister Steve Webb.

Before the last election the same team comprised of Mr Alexander, Mr Laws and MPs Andrew Stunnell, who is retiring, and Chris Huhne, who was jailed last year for perverting the course of justice.

Flashback: The coalition was formed in May 2010, days after David Cameron failed to secure an overall majority against Labour's Gordon Brown, who was ousted from Number 10

While analysis of the coalition agreement suggested the Lib Dems secured 75 per cent of their manifesto, high profile policies like the pledge to scrap tuition fees and oppose a VAT rise were jettisoned, leading to a dramatic slump in the polls.

Mr Alexander said: ‘We owe it to the British people to be as well prepared as possible so that we can ensure a responsible, stable outcome, as we did in 2010.

‘We are on a journey as a party of government. Having Liberal Democrats in government next time is the only way to secure the economic recovery, keep British politics in the centre ground, and deliver a stronger economy in a fairer society. That is why we take preparing seriously.’

But Michael Dugher, Labour’s shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said: ‘This shows how completely arrogant, delusional and out of touch the Lib Dems are.

‘The Lib Dems have a new rallying cry: go back to your constituencies and prepare to break your promises.

‘This is a self-serving committee for more horse-trading, squabbling and broken promises.

‘The only people who will decide the outcome of the next election will be the British people and they know the truth about Nick Clegg and the Lib Dems: you can't trust a word they say.’
