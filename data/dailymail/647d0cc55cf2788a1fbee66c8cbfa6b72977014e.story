A 59-year-old man gallantly failed earlier this month to become the first hiker to cross the Sierra Nevada mountain range in a wheelchair.

Bob Coomber, who lives in the Livermore, California, has been in a wheelchair since he was 38 years old after developing osteoporosis in his mid-30's as a side effect of diabetes.

Despite Bob’s predicament, it hasn’t stopped him from pursuing his passion for hiking and he has now twice attempt this feat of extreme endurance.

Last year Bob had to turn around because his insulin pump failed him, but that made him only more determined to try again this year.

Inspired by reading about Bob’s gallant first attempt, photojournalist Ezra Shaw met with him and decided to tag along on his second attempt.

‘Over the next six months, Bob and I would occasionally meet up for a hike through the hills around Livermore,’ he wrote about training with Coomber.

‘I was amazed at how he didn’t let being in a wheelchair deter him from difficult terrain. He just took the trails slow and steady and eventually got to where he wanted to be.’

On Bob's second attempt at crossing the mountain range, he planned to start on the eastern side of the Sierra's, before crossing over Kearsarge Pass and hoped to finish in Kings Canyon National Park

On Bob's second attempt at crossing the mountain range, he planned to start on the eastern side of the Sierra's, before crossing over Kearsarge Pass and hoped to finish in Kings Canyon National Park.

The total hike would be 22 miles and Bob hoped to make the journey in one week.

Over a three day period, Bob rolled up steep trails that were covered in rocks. At each rock that was too big to roll over, Bob would get out of his chair, slide across the ground, pull his chair behind him, and then get back into his chair.

Towards the end of his third day of hiking, he encountered a field of boulders. He attached a rope to his wheelchair and then looped the rope around his back. Then he slowly started pulling himself across the rocks with his chair bumping along behind him.

Unfortunately, the rock field was too much for Bob to handle. After sitting on the rocks for a few minutes, Bob made the decision that it was time to turn around.

'The blister on his hand was getting worse and a new one was forming on his other hand. Although disappointed, he was still happy with how far he had made it,' wrote Shaw about the moment when Bob decided he couldn't continue.

'The reward is being out and in it all,' Bob told him. 'Seeing the deer go by and hearing the squirrels, and seeing the waterfalls, and knowing I can still do it.'

'I was amazed at how far Bob got. I know he wishes that he made it all the way through to Kings Canyon, but what he did accomplish is still beyond remarkable', wrote Shaw about Bob's bravery and determination.

'He said that he hopes it will inspire people that aren’t that active to get out and go for a hike. I know that it has inspired me.'

Coomber stays warm at the Onion Valley campground at the base of the Sierra Nevada Mountain Range the night before he planned to start his hike on September 16

'The reward is being out and in it all,' Bob told his companion Ezra Shaw. 'Seeing the deer go by and hearing the squirrels, and seeing the waterfalls, and knowing I can still do it'
