Two teenagers who gatecrashed a party at a lottery winner's home and shrieked abuse at police have been fined just £85.

Courtney Colarusso, 18 and Kalem Tinnuche, 19, were among 300 revellers at a party at a lottery winner's house - after spotting details of the bash on Facebook.

The young pair appeared in court today after descending on lottery millionaire Sandra Fosbrooke's home when her daughter threw a 16th birthday bash.

Daughter Ffion posted details of the event on Facebook - and her mother's six-bedroom luxury home bought from her £12m jackpot was overrun with uninvited guests.

A court heard how police, who were trying to stop drunken brawls breaking out in the street around the luxury home, were verbally abused by Colarusso and Tinnuche.

The were seized outside the house near Llanelli, South Wales.

Llanelli magistrates court heard how Colarusso who was 'extremely under the influence of alcohol' fell flat on her face on the pavement outside the house.

She repeatedly swore at an officer who tried to help her calling him a 'muppet' and daring him to arrest her.

Mr Neave said: 'PC Young approached her to help her get to her feet.

'She screamed: "Get your f****** hands off me".

Sandra Fosbrooke and Ken Henry won the lottery in May 2005, but split up after their relationship came to an end earlier this year

'She was very intoxicated and clearly under the influence of alcohol.

'PC Young escorted her to the road. She shouted at PC Young "f*** off you f****** ar******".'

Tinnuche was arrested after swearing at officers who were trying to stop him kicking a wall. When arrested he said: 'Yeah, whatever.'

Prosecutor Gerald Neave said: 'Officers were sent to the address after reports of fighting in the street.

'When they arrived at the scene they found between 200 and 300 people people out on the road.

'A large disturbance was going on resulting in numerous persons being arrested.'

Gareth Jones, defending, said: 'His (Tinnuche's) friends had seen the party advertised on Facebook and they invited him along.'

Daughter Ffion was nine when her mother shared a £12.8 million jackpot with then partner Ken Henry in 2005.

Sandra was on the checkout at ASDA when she won the lottery with bingo hall worker Ken.

The couple enjoyed the millionaire lifestyle together travelling all over the world and splashing out on houses, cars.

But they split up after their relationship came to an end earlier this year and Sandra moved into the £415,000 property where the party took place.

Sandra, who used a slice of her fortune to buy a pub, was working behind the bar on night of the party having left Ffion at home to enjoy her birthday.

She rushed home after being contacted by the police and found her house had been trashed by the partygoers.

Colarusso and Tinnuche, both of Llanelli, admitted using threatening words and behaviour.

Both were given 12-month conditional discharges for the offences and ordered to pay £85 each towards court costs.
