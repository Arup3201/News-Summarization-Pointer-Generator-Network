A dressmaker made famous by appearing on TV's Big Fat Gypsy Weddings is being sued for sacking the head designer at her boutique.

Thelma Madine paid Leanne Phillips £400 a week to design dresses for Nico Bridal Company, based in Liverpool, and praised her for taking the business 'to another level'.

But last December, she fired the 31-year-old after six years, allegedly after a row at the shop.

Sued: Thelma Madine, who found fame on Big Fat Gypsy Weddings, is facing a claim for unfair dismissal from her former head designer

Sacked: Leanne Phillips was fired from Nico Bridal Company last December after working there for six years

Ms Madine, 61, makes wedding and christening dresses aimed at young women and girls from the traveller community.

She was featured on Channel 4's reality TV show Big Fat Gypsy Weddings, and went on to star in her own spin-off, Thelma's Gypsy Girls.

Ms
Phillips also featured in the show as one of Ms Madine's closest 
associates - but on December 6 last year, she was sacked from Nico.

She is now suing her former boss for unfair dismissal at an employment tribunal which will take place next Monday.

In her claim, Ms Phillips alleges 
her boss sacked her after a row, then attempted to gather further 
evidence against her by quizzing other employees.

She
also claims the workplace was ‘unstructured’ when it came to 
disciplinary matters, and that attempts to appeal her boss's decision 
were ignored.

The 
disciplinary hearing against her was chaired by Ms Madine, Ms Phillips 
claims, even though she herself was the complainant too.

The former 
designer also says that Ms Madine was often at the centre of 'heated 
arguments' at the business, which never led to disciplinary action 
against anyone else.

Ms Phillips is demanding £1,200 in back pay which she says she is owed, and also wants to be reinstated to her old job.

Responding to the claims in an 
official tribunal court document, Ms Madine admitted that no formal 
disciplinary policy existed but claimed she felt intimidated during the 
row, which was apparently sparked when the employee asked for a day off.

Ms Phillips apparently screamed 'you horrible b****' at the manager and kept interrupting a discussion between her mother, who also worked at the company, and Ms Madine, according to the document.

Ms
Madine said that she only consulted Ms Phillips' colleagues in order to
obtain evidence about the argument, and added that those co-workers freely 
volunteered information about previous alleged wrongdoing.

She added that she had
conducted a lengthy investigation into the issue, and said she 
had not withheld any information from Ms Phillips.

An appeal was apparently heard by a solicitor independent of the firm, who concluded that Ms Madine was right to fire Ms Phillips and it would be 'untenable' for the latter to return to the firm.

The boss denied that there was 'a culture of arguments involving shouting, swearing and intimidation' at the business.

Praise: Ms Madine once described Ms Phillips as 'full of imaginative ideas and passion' as an employee

'I totally deny any wrongdoing,' Ms Phillips said. 'I believe I was unfairly treated after a long and loyal service.

'It has been really hard to come to terms with. My job at Nico was my life and losing it was heartbreaking.

'It
came at completely the wrong time, as I was recently engaged and 
planning my own wedding. I had never been out of work since leaving 
school and found unbearable the thought of signing on benefits a few 
weeks before Christmas.

'After
Christmas, I started job-hunting - I even applied for a job at a hotel,
but my fiancé and family were upset that I was wasting my talents so 
they encouraged me to set up my own business.

'I
can't wait until the tribunal is over and I can put that part of my 
life behind me. I am looking forward to designing and making my own 
dresses for the travelling community and building a future for myself 
and my family.'

She has now set up a competing design company, Leanne Alexandra, which also makes dresses for travellers.

Ms Madine effusively praised Ms Phillips in her autobiography, Tales Of The Gypsy Dressmaker, which was published last year.

She
wrote: 'Leanne is now the head designer at Nico and is starting to 
oversee parts of the process that I had to do, which is great, because 
it means that I can concentrate on other parts of the business.

'I
used to feel that every one of my dresses was like my baby and that no 
one could do them as well as me - I am a bit of a control freak! - but I
know now that the future of Nico is in Leanne's hands.

'Since she started working for me, Leanne has taken Nico to another level.

'And I have to admit that she reminds me of me at her age, full of imaginative ideas and passion for the task in hand.'

Ms
Madine, a mother of three, started sewing 18 years ago after the 
breakdown of her marriage, and began by selling dresses at a market 
stall in Liverpool.

Despite
serving four months in jail for benefit fraud, an experience which she 
said she 'thoroughly enjoyed', her business has apparently thrived since
she found TV fame.

Ms Madine was unavailable for comment on the upcoming employment tribunal.
