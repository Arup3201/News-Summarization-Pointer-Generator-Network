Neymar might not be better than Pele but in many ways he is already bigger. In the modern world of sports marketing 22-year-old Neymar’s image is omnipresent in Brazil.

'Neymar-keting' sees the player endorse a wide range of products from soft drinks to mobile phones and he has even appeared on the front cover of Time magazine.

On Monday he will aim to endear himself further to a besotted Brazil by leading the World Cup hosts to victory against Cameroon.

Fancy footwork: Neymar is the poster boy for the World Cup and his image is all over Brazil

Hopes of a nation: Brazil fans will be praying Neymar can lead them to World Cup glory

All this from a player who four years ago could have moved to, er, West Ham.

In 2010 agent Barry Silkman alerted the club to a new Brazilian wonder player at Santos - the club where Pele played.

The Hammers swiftly made a £12million bid for a player then 'unknown' in Europe.

But Santos, and one suspects the Neymar family, turned the offer down. An approach from Chelsea soon after was rejected, too.

Neymar moved on to Barcelona last summer.

Mexico skipper Rafael Marquez, who will lead his country out against Croatia on Monday, has set a new record this summer.

He is the first player in World Cup history to have worn the captain’s armband at FOUR consecutive finals.

 

One to Watch:

Chile’s Alexis Sanchez is often left in the shadows at Barcelona despite being the club's second top scorer behind Lionel Messi.

Danger man: Alexis Sanchez (left) has impressed for Chile and has attracted interest from Livepool

But he showed his talent in Chile’s wins over Australia and Spain and will pose a big threat to Holland.

Liverpool fans will be particularly interested in the 25-year-old on Monday, as Sanchez could be offered by Barcelona in part exchange for Luis Suarez.

 

Holland only need to avoid defeat against Chile to finish top of group B and stay on course for what could be a classic Total Football v Samba soccer final.

Kicking up a storm: Robin van Persie and Holland will top group B if they beat Chile tonight

If the Dutch do top their group they would avoid Brazil in the first knockout stage and most likely face Mexico - creating a path for a possible Holland v Brazil final

If Brazil, who kick off their final group game four hours after the Dutch, much to the chagrin of boss Louis van Gaal, top their group they would face Chile, who have the capability of bursting the balloons of both countries.

 

I-Say:

It is not often I agree with what Sven Goran Eriksson has to say.

After all, here is a manager who, after a brief period of bringing some stability to the England set up, wasted a 'golden generation' who should have got much closer to winning the World Cup or European Championships when he was in charge.

He was allowed to stay in the job far too long.

Time to go: Roy Hodgson has taken charge of England for two tournaments with little success so far

Underperformed: Eriksson's England were expected to do better than two quarter finals at World Cups

But he is spot on to say the FA are wrong to back Roy Hodgson who, ahead of Tuesday’s game against Costa Rica, says he won’t quit.

The fact is Hodgson has been in charge for two tournaments and England have underperformed badly.

The whole set up needs a fresh approach. The problem is many contenders don’t really want the job.

It is interesting to see that sources close to Hull boss Steve Bruce have indicated he would be willing to take on the challenge - or poisoned chalice depending on your view.

I say he would be a good choice. Bruce would be an ideal figure to nurture the young players emerging and would be tactically more flexible than Hodgson. He would also help former Manchester Unite team-mate Gary Neville mature into the role down the line.

 

World Cup Bet :

Arjen Robben and Neymar are in contention for the Golden Boot so 6-1 for them both to score on Monday seems decent.

Lethal: Arjen Robben has scored three goals for Holland in two World Cup games so far

And given the amount of goals that have been scored a punt on four or more goals at 12-1 is worth a tickle.

Brazil to beat Cameroon 4-0 is just 7-1.

 

World Cup Moment :

Cameroon, who play Brazil on Monday, burst on to the scence at Italia 90 and were on their way to knocking England out at the quarter finals stage.

England were trailing 2-1 with time running out but then Gary Lineker won converted two penalties.
