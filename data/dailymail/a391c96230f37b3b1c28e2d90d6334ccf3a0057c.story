A home-made book containing stories, photographs, and heartfelt pleas to come home that was taken into the trenches by a British soldier has been revealed for the first time in nearly a century.

The pocket-sized keepsake was made for Osborne Wrigley by his then girlfriend Dora Pimley while he was serving in the First World War.

Mr Wrigley, from Manchester, who joined the Royal Fusiliers in September 1914 and was promoted to 2nd Lieutenant in 1917, took the book with him into the frontline and it survived the 1914-18 conflict.  The couple went on to marry.

'Osborne Dearest': The front page of the book Dora Pimley made for her soldier lover Osborne Wrigley

The book, which comforted the young soldier from Manchester, was made by his girlfriend, pining at home

The book, dated August 3, 1916, makes 
romantic references to the couple, calling Dora a princess and Osborne a prince.

There is a page for every member of his family, a picture of his 
family’s home in Moss Side, and a mention of the family dog.

In
a heartfelt plea Miss Pimley wrote: 'Have you dear Osborne received the
message of this little book? I think you have, for always you have 
heard my call.

'As you look
at the old familiar faces, may these do you real good and make your 
life a little brighter, a little happier knowing that all think of you 
each day and wish you well.'

Miss Pimley went on to marry her handsome soldier after the war, and the happy couple settled in Stockport

The couple wed after the war and lived in Stockport until they died within two years of each other in the 1970s

The
couple were reunited and married soon after the war, and lived happily 
in Stockport. They died within two years of each other in the late 
1970s, while they were living with their son Ross in Poynton.

The book was discovered among Mrs Wrigley’s possessions after she died, along with Mr Wrigley’s war medals and uniform badges.

It is now owned by Sally Wrigley, from Bollington near Macclesfield, who was married to the couple's late son.

Mrs Wrigley, 91, said: 'I wanted to share the book because it is an amazing artefact that survived the trenches.

The Wrigleys lived until the 1970s but daughter-in-law Sally Wrigley, right, now has the amazing keepsakes

'Osborne would never discuss what he 
experienced during the war, especially his time in the trenches - it was
so awful he didn’t want to remember. But the book must have meant a lot
to him because he kept it safe and brought it back.

'It was created to keep Osborne’s spirits up while he was there in that horrible situation.'

She added: 'They were very devoted to each other throughout their entire lives.

'It’s a lovely heirloom for the family to keep as a reminder of where this family started from.'
