There are plenty of calendars on offer for 2015 featuring scantily-clad men and women - but none are quite like 'Splash Heroes'.

The models who pose for each month have only milk to protect their modesty.

The innovative images were created by Polish photographer Jaroslav Wieczorkiewicz, who specialises in working with liquid.

Super shot: The naked models are splashed with coloured milk and three cameras capture the fluid motion

It's raining milk: The character Storm from The X Men is recreated thanks to liquid being thrown at the model 

Woman Woman: Polish photographer Jaroslav Wieczorkiewicz is the whizz behind the images

Each girl is covered in pints of milk and then Wieczorkiewicz takes a number of shots using three different cameras. As the jugs of milk are thrown at the women, the movement of the liquid is captured using fast exposure.

The individual frames are then layered in Photoshop to create the finished result.

Wieczorkiewicz, who is now based in London and has founded the Aurum Light Studio, said: 'We work with specific light and pretty normal cameras, there is no magic behind it.'

Girl power: The photographer chose the superhero theme because he wanted something 'colourful and cool'

Calcium caped crusader: It took five days to shoot the Splash Heroes calendar which is available to buy

Cat that got the cream: Cat Woman's suit is all thanks to milk coloured with pigments and food colourisers

This is not the first time the photographer has had success with his milk works of art.

Last year, he created the 'Milky Pin-ups' calendar using models covered in milk in a Fifties theme, with one parodying Marilyn Monroe's famous pose in a white dress from The Seven Year Itch.

The pictures impressed Coca Cola so much they used them in a U.S. ad campaign for Fairlife Milk.  

Speaking about the inspiration for the superhero calendar, Wieczorkiewicz writes on the Aurum Light blog: 'This time we wanted to make a very relaxed and colourful series… simply, something really cool!'

Taste of success: London-based Wieczorkiewicz has previously impressed with his 'Milky Pin-ups' calendar which was used for a national advertising campaign in the U.S

Strong look: The Hulk tribute is created using green lighting and a very toned model

He explains how his parodies of superheroes like Bat Girl and Wonder Woman took five days to shoot.

'Milk was coloured with pigments and food colourisers to match the concepts. The biggest challenge was to accomplish a specific shapes for the illustrations,' he explains. 'In terms of the gear: We were shooting on three different cameras: Nikon D800, Phase One IQ280, Phase One IQ240 mounted on my favourite Manfrotto tripod platform.'

The limited edition 2015 Splash Heroes calendar costs £39.99 and is available to order via www.aurumlight.com/calendar/
