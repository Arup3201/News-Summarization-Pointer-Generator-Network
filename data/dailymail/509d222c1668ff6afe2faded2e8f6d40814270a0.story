Ailing radio personality Casey Kasem was in critical condition with an infected bedsore at a Washington state hospital, as his daughter and wife headed to court for another hearing in a dispute over his care.

The 82-year-old Kasem was receiving intravenous antibiotics and other care Thursday for a serious pressure ulcer he had when he was admitted on Sunday, according to a statement from St. Anthony Hospital in Gig Harbor.

Hospital spokesman Scott Thompson said Friday he would make no comment beyond the statement.

People reports that his two daughters are already in the hospital with him with his son on the way.

His health is reportedly alert but it is uncertain how badly his health has deteriorated.

Meanwhile, a hearing was scheduled later in the day in Kitsap County Superior Court in the dispute between Kasem's  wife Jean Kasem and his daughter Kerri Kasem, who has said in a court filing that her father has a form of dementia.

Jean Kasem has been in control of her husband's medical care and has controlled access to him as his children from an earlier marriage contested who should make decisions about his care.

On May 20, while Kasem and his wife were in Washington state, Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Daniel S. Murphy ordered Jean Kasem to comply with court orders allowing doctors to evaluate her husband, and also permit Kerri Kasem to see him.

The judge also ordered Jean Kasem to surrender her husband's passport and temporarily suspended her powers to determine her husband's medical care.

The ruling came after Casey and Jean Kasem were tracked down by Kitsap County deputies on May 13 at the home of long-time family friends.

Jean Kasem said they were on a family vacation.

Kitsap County is west of Seattle.

Daughter Kerri Kasem has been in a protracted legal battle with Kasem's second wife Jean over control of her father's care

Last week, a Washington state judge reiterated the order to allow visits by Kerri Kasem, who brought a doctor on Sunday and her father was taken to the hospital.

As Casey Kasem was taken out of the home, Jean Kasem tossed a package of ground meat at her stepdaughter.

Before chucking the meat, Jean Kasem recited a passage from the Bible.

'In the name of King David, I throw a 
piece of raw meat into the street in exchange for (giving) my husband to
the wild rabid dogs,' the 59-year-old said, according to NBC News.

She later added: 'If you need to know why I did it â€” when a person is about to pass away, there are always rabid dogs.'

Jean has accused Kerri Kasem of owing her and her husband $1.3m and wanting to give the star's fortune to the Church of Scientology.

Since May 6, his wife Jean had been 
caring for him at a friend's house outside Seattle, Washington. He was 
removed on Sunday after a judge awarded Kerri temporary custody of her 
father.

Jean Kasem has now 
accused Kerri Kasem of wanting to donate her father's fortune to the 
Church of Scientology, in documents submitted to Kitsap Superior Court, NBC News has reported.

Kerri
Kasem yesterday denied being a member of the Church of Scientology and 
borrowing money from her father as she described the claims as a 
'defamation of character'.

Kasem gained fame with his radio music countdown shows, 'American Top 40' and 'Casey's Top 40,' and he was the voice of Shaggy in the cartoon 'Scooby Doo.'
