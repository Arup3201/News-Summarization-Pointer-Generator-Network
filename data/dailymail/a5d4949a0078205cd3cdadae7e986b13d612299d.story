John Hirst who has campaigned for prisoners to win the right to vote. He murdered his landlady with an axe

Clamour for Britain to leave the European Court of Human Rights intensified last night, after the only UK judge on the panel called for axe murderers to be given the vote.

The remark from Paul Mahoney, a bureaucrat who has never sat as a judge in this country, shocked MPs.

‘If you are killed by an axe murderer, I would still give him the vote – he would have a say,’ Mr Mahoney told a cross-party group of politicians in Strasbourg.

The comment appears to be a reference to John Hirst, who served 25 years in prison after killing his landlady with an axe. Hirst has led the campaign for prisoners to be given the vote.

Mr Mahoney claimed the Government should back down over its refusal to accept a ruling from his court that Britain’s blanket ban on prisoner votes is illegal. He said the decision was just a ‘fleabite’ on the independence of Britain’s judicial system – and suggested that defying the ECHR would damage the country’s reputation abroad.

The comments enraged MPs at the meeting, which was held to explain how the court works. Conservative MP Ian Liddell-Grainger said Mr Mahoney’s intervention merely strengthened the case for Britain withdrawing from it.

‘The idea of giving axe murderers the vote is grotesque and has been rejected by a huge majority in Parliament,’ he said.

‘They have forfeited the right to vote by their crimes. It is outrageous for [Mr Mahoney] to lecture us that the view of a sovereign parliament is less important than that of his court.

‘Britain has had enough of this court’s meddling in our affairs. It is not fit for purpose and, in my view, we should come out.’

Jeffrey Donaldson, a Democratic Unionist MP who also attended the meeting, said  ‘the idea of giving axe murderers the vote will repel most people’.

He added: ‘If you are the family of a victim of such a crime, how would you feel to hear the highest court in Europe accord these rights to your loved one’s killer?

‘From our experience in Northern Ireland, we would be very concerned about the idea of people convicted of acts of terrorism being given a vote in the democracy they have tried to overthrow.’

Tory MP Dominic Raab said Mr Mahoney’s comments reinforced the case for overhauling the Strasbourg court. ‘The only “flea” is the Strasbourg Court sucking the lifeblood out of our democratic authority, with each bite it takes in cases like John Hirst,’ he said.

The ECHR has repeatedly ruled that Britain’s ban on prisoner voting is illegal under the European Convention on Human Rights.

However, successive governments have refused to change the law, with David Cameron saying the thought of giving prisoners the vote makes him feel ‘physically sick’. In 2011, MPs voted to maintain Britain’s ban by an overwhelming margin of 234 to 22.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling announced last year that a joint committee of MPs and peers would consider three options.

One would see the current ban retained, while the other two would allow some prisoners to vote; those serving sentences of less than six months, or less than four years.

Ministers will then allow MPs to vote on one of these options. Mr Grayling said: ‘The British public want decisions taken about our democracy to be taken by our Parliament and not by an international court. That is why the Tories want wholesale reform of our human rights laws.'

A spokesman for the ECHR confirmed there had been an ‘open and frank exchange’ of views when MPs met ECHR officials on Tuesday.

He added: ‘The question of the right to vote of prisoners and the implementation of the judgment “Hirst v. the UK” was discussed. Judge Mahoney stated that the judgment – concerning an axe murderer – should now be implemented in the wider interest of the Convention system, and asked the members of the delegation to encourage this outcome at their level.’
