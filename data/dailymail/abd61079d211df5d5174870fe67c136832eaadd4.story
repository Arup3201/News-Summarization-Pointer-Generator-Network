Clearly not satisfied with the cleaning capability of a normal electric toothbrush, a Japanese teenager has uploaded videos of himself strapping toothbrushes to various weapons.

YouTube user tokioFN has uploaded a video showing his attempt to brush his teeth with a toothbrush strapped to an automatic pistol.

In other videos uploaded, the boy strapped toothbrushes to a rifle and a gas gun.

Needless to say, no dentistry body will be vouching for the contraption's effectiveness anytime soon.

A spokesperson for the Australia Dental Association has warned of the dangers of such inappropriate behaviour.

“This is reckless behaviour and could result in serious damage to the teeth, gums and palate which may be permanent."

Taking on the task of human testing himself, it’s highly doubtful the product will ever be hitting store shelves either.
