Jose Mourinho made a young Shrewsbury fan's night by meeting up with 11-year-old cancer sufferer Lloyd Burton before Chelsea's Capital One Cup encounter with the League Two outfit.

Mourinho posed for a picture with Lloyd and signed an autograph for the young fan, who painted a portrait of the Portuguese tactician before the game.

Lloyd was a promising player but is now in a wheelchair having undergone chemotherapy on a brain tumour diagnosed in May last year.

Manager Micky Mellon describes local youngster Lloyd as the club’s ‘most famous’ supporter after appearing alongside David Beckham on the recent Stand Up To Cancer fundraising programme on Channel 4.

As part of a scheme to involve children from the community in the club, Lloyd applied colour to a paint-by-numbers portrait of Mourinho, which the Portuguese signed before kick-off.

It will then be auctioned to raise money so Lloyd, who may never walk again, can have his quality of life boosted with a lift installed in his house and a wet room so he can bathe comfortably.
