She has a penchant for sky-high stilettos and even famously squeezed her swollen feet into a pair of perspex heels when she was heavily pregnant.

So, it comes as no surprise that Kim Kardashian wanted to slip into a pair of stylish stilettos for her wedding.

And the reality TV star was so desperate to slip into her wedding shoes that she reportedly spent £3,000 splashing out on toe lipo. The operation has been dubbed the 'Loub job', in honour of famous shoe designer Christian Louboutin, whose designs can be extremely narrow and pointy.

Fitting in: Kim Kardashian, who tied the knot with Kanye West in a lavish ceremony at the weekend, reportedly underwent 'toe lipo' to fit into her wedding shoes

According to Look magazine the 33-year-old, who tied the knot with Kanye West in a lavish Italian ceremony on Saturday, had 'toebesity' liposuction on her feet so she could ease them into her shoes pain-free.

'Toe lipo, also nicknamed 'a Loub job', is a procedure to remove a small bit of fat so your toes can fit better into pointy stilettos without pinching.

'Cosmetic surgeons and podiatrists can use tiny instruments to remove a small amount of fat - typically from the big toes,' cosmetic surgeon Wendy Lewis told the magazine.

Remember when? Kim famously crammed her swollen feet into a pair of sky-high perspex stilettos when she was pregnant - clearly she's keen to avoid making the same mistake again

Kim is currently honeymooning in Ireland after her multi-million 
dollar nuptials on Saturday, which saw the couple say their vows on a hilltop overlooking 
Florence, shielded by a 20ft high wall of white roses and peonies as the
 sun began to set at the 16th century Forte di Belvedere.

Kim
chose a demure mermaid-silhouette gown in delicate white lace 
custom-made by Givenchy, who also designed a little white dress for her 
11-month-old daughter North.

Small panels of sheer lace 
decorated the arm and also accentuated her slimmed down waist. The 
backless dress was long-sleeved with a train, while a dramatic flowing 
white cathedral-length veil completed the look. The bride's hair was 
worn loose and long, with her make-up restrained and flawless.

Mother-of-the-bride Kris Jenner walked down the aisle ahead of her daughter, along with baby North, according to TMZ.

Kim and Kanye
 took a private jet to Cork, Ireland, on Sunday afternoon for their stay 
at the five-star Castlemartyr Resort in East Cork, according to the 
Irish Independent.

The couple won't be away from their baby for long, however.

'They
planned to stay in Europe for a week or two post-wedding, until Kanye 
has to perform at the X Games,' a source told People.

The Mercy rapper will next take his Yeezus Tour to the X Games in Austin, Texas, on June 7.

E! News report
that the couple are cutting their honeymoon short to attend another 
wedding of Kanye's stylists the following weekend, rumoured to be in 
Prague.
