An intricate wooden ornament used as a doorstop for 40 years has turned out to be a Chinese relic worth over £250,000.

The nine-inch-tall item is a carved brush pot dating back to the late 18th century when it would have been used to store calligraphers’ brushes.

It was handed down generations until it reached the unnamed husband and wife, who used it to prop open their living room door.

The intricate wooden ornament dates back 300 years but its owners, unaware, used it to prop open a door

Hoping to buy a car, the pair invited an auctioneer to their cottage home in Hertfordshire to value some other ornaments.

But expert Richard Harrison was stunned when he spotted the brush pot on the floor, instantly recognising it as a Chinese masterpiece.

'It was on the floor in the living room being used to keep the door open,' said Mr Harrison.

'I knew what it was but just not how good it was.

'As soon as we were able to share the details of this brush pot with our network in China, it became clear that interest in this piece was going to be phenomenal.'

At least 300 years old, the pot was crafted during the reign of Chinese emperor Quinlong.

The carvings around the nine-inch-tall pot are classic designs of the Quinlong era in 18th century China

Despite its mistaken identity, auctioneers expect to see bidders offering up to £250,000 for the item

The brush pot, which is 12 inches wide, is a rare example of Zitan artwork and is carved from a single piece of wood.

Mr Harrison said its heritage could see bidders offer up to £250,000: ‘We gave it a pre-sale estimate of £20,000 to £30,000 which the owners were gobsmacked with and very happy with.

‘But that price has encouraged many interested parties.

‘We expect our phone lines to be fully booked on the day of the sale and we know many Chinese specialists are travelling to our auction room specially to be able to bid in person.

‘With that level of interest, we could see it realise a sum of a quarter-of-a-million pounds.’

Originally, it would have been used to store calligraphers' brushes. It has since been handed down generations

The couple in Hertfordshire were shocked by the price prediction as they tried to sell less valuable items

The intricate figures show hundreds of boys setting of firecrackers and climbing traditional buildings

The images show dozens of figures in a popular Chinese subject known as ‘The Hundred Boys’ around the outside.

Mr Harrison added: 'It is a wonderful thing. The carving is very much three dimsensional almost and shows figures of little boys doing things like setting off fire crackers.

'It is a real tour de force and is in superb condition which is remarkable given what is was being used for.

'A piece like this only serves to show the hidden value of items which may have been lying in people’s homes for years.'

The auction takes place on April 29.
