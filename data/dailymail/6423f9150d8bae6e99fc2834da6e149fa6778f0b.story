A children's toy gun which is being given away free has been branded so realistic police have warned children carrying it they could be shot down for carrying it.

Police are calling for CoolKidz! magazine in its latest issue, to be withdrawn from the shelves.

Officers say the gun is so realistic it could spark a full scale firearm alert if police spot a child carrying it.

They have warned a teenager wielding the gun in public could be arrested and even run the risk of being shot by armed response officers.  

In the latest edition of the magazine it offers the Army Action Gun with real rapid fire sounds for the £2.50 cover price.

The magazine is aimed at primary school children and is stocked by newsagents across the country and some supermarkets.

Sergeant Nigel Boshein, of Hampshire Police told The Daily Star, 'I'm shocked that this is readily available.'

While a spokesman for Exeter based LCD, publishers of the £2.50 CoolKidz! magazine, said: 'This item is very clearly a toy.;

The magazine is designed for young children and is published eight times a year.

On the Newsstand website under the description for the magazine it says: 'It has free posterz, puzzlez, and loads of amazing free giftz and toyz for when your wii isn’t working and you’ve put away your playstation.

'Cool Kidz reviews and tests the latest video games, and explains the latest cool gadgets. A boy’s mag exclusively for the nascent gamer.'
