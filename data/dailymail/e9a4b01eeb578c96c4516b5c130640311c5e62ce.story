The tearful father of an Irish tourist who was charged over a one-punch attack on his younger brother said his sons have loved each other since they were children.

Barry Lyttle, 33, was granted bail at Sydney Central Court on Monday after he allegedly punched his younger brother Patrick, 31, at about 3am on Saturday in the Kings Cross nightclub district.

He was reunited with his father, Oliver Lyttle, outside court while his younger brother remained in a stable but critical condition at St Vincent’s Hospital in Sydney’s inner east.

His father, Oliver Lyttle, 74, appeared distraught and red-faced as Barry emerged from custody, wearing a blue jumper and his face unshaven.

The pair wrapped each other in a tight hug before driving away, believed for St Vincent's Hospital where Patrick is being treated. 

'They've loved each other since they were kids,' Mr Lyttle said. 'I want to thank St Vincent's Hospital for everything that they have done. 

'I want to thank everybody for the way things have went (in court today) and their sympathy.'

Barry, who has been in custody since the attack, will now be able to visit his brother after being granted bail. He was hugged by his tearful father when he left the court.

As part of his bail conditions, Barry has to hand over his Irish passport to authorities and is not allowed to approach his brother within 12 hours of consuming alcohol. 

He will also live with his Australian aunty at a Blacktown address and he will have to report to Blacktown Police Station each day.

Mr Lyttle’s lawyer Christopher Watson argued Barry should only have to report to the police station weekly as he wanted to spend time with his wounded brother, but the Magistrate denied this request.

His family will also have to cough up a $2,000 surety and he will face Downing Centre Local court on January 20.

Barry and his father Oliver arrived in Australia on December 29 to visit Patrick, who arrived in Sydney for an Australian-wide trip last June. 

The siblings from Belfast in Ireland had been dining with their father earlier in the evening before the two young men went to a bar for a drink.

Police say Barry punched his younger brother in the head during an argument causing him to fall backwards and hit the footpath.

Paramedics treated Patrick at the scene before taking him to hospital where he underwent emergency surgery.

Police have described the incident as a 'family tragedy' and Detective Superintendent Michael Fitzgerald said the 'pain in their father's eyes was indescribable'. 

The incident was caught on CCTV cameras and Barry reportedly screamed in shock and distress when he realised the extent of his brother's injuries. 

Alcohol was not a factor in the fight with Barry's blood alcohol concentration reading in the low range. The fight was said to have occurred after a minor argument.

The accused has been in custody since the incident and weeped with his head down during a video link appearance at Parramatta Local Court on Saturday afternoon.

Barry wiped away tears as he sat unshaven in a blue jumper in the dock as agonised relatives, including his father Oliver, watched the court proceedings

In a series of  Facebook posts before the incident, the brothers had previously expressed how excited they were about their Australian reunion.

Patrick has been travelling around Australia for the past six months and often received messages from Barry advising him to 'stay safe'.

In anticipation of the two meeting up in Sydney Barry posted to Patrick on Facebook: 'Not be long bro! See ya soon. Safe trip the pair of ya!' 

A little over a month before the incident, Barry Lyttle messaged his little brother Patrick, who was travelling around Australia and told him to keep safe

The brothers were eagerly waiting their reunion in Australia in January. Patrick had been travelling around the country since early June 

In October Barry Lyttle again told his brother Patrick to say safe via a message on Social Media
