British bosses are offering thousands of jobs to Romanian workers as unemployment in the UK soars.

Just days ago, officials revealed that the number of British unemployed had reached a 17-year high of 2.68million.

But more than 2,400 vacancies, including roles for nurses, engineers, chefs and other skilled workers, are being advertised by an online recruitment agency in Bucharest.

Young and on the dole: Young people are feeling a disproportionate impact from contraction in the jobs market

The firm says that British companies are trying to fill 2,434 new jobs with Romanian workers – making the UK a better bet for migrant workers than Germany, which is advertising 2,387 positions.

Many of the posts in Britain are for medical positions, tourism professionals and skilled staff, with 25 per cent being offered to labourers and unskilled workers.

Earlier this month, UK unemployment hit 8.4 per cent, its highest level since 1994. But official figures show that nine out of ten jobs created in 2010 went to foreign nationals.

The Romanian website, TjobsRecruit, cheerily greets prospective job seekers with ‘New year, new job, new life!’

The vacancies, advertised in English, include 28 taxi driver jobs located all over the UK, nursing roles in care homes for £12 an hour, sales positions promising a minimum salary of £750 a month, junior doctors and aircraft engineers.

The Britons missing out

There are also 80 vacancies at gastropubs, three-star and four-star hotels in Oxfordshire, Warwickshire, Sussex and Surrey. These include opportunities for waiters (£12,646 a year), housekeepers (£6.20 an hour), receptionists (£14,500 a year) maintenance workers (£7.28 an hour) and various kitchen posts from porters to head chefs.

In 2010, the British Medical Association put the number of unemployed junior doctors in the UK at around 3,000. Yet the Romanian website is advertising for the junior doctor’s position of residential medical officer at hospitals across the UK.

Henry Smith, Conservative MP for Crawley, West Sussex, said he was concerned that jobs such as junior chef positions were being advertised to outside Britain when unemployment within the country is so high.

He went on: ‘Now we are in a global economic crisis we should be ensuring where possible jobs are filled by British people.

‘I can’t believe in the Crawley and Gatwick area there isn’t a suitably committed chef who is a resident of this country and cannot see why there is a requirement to advertise this job abroad, and that goes for other positions as well.

‘As a country we have become increasingly restricted by our membership of the EU to ensure local jobs are going to local people who are from this country.

Turn for the worse: Unemployment and the numbers claiming jobless benefits are headed in the wrong direction.

‘This is still part of the problem, despite the Government introducing controls on people from Bulgaria and Romania.

‘I just don’t buy the argument that you can’t fill a job for a sous chef in a hotel kitchen in Gatwick locally or the commutable area. We are not talking about a highly specialist pieces of knowledge.

‘I’m sure there are plenty of sous chefs in Crawley who would jump at the chance to work in a top class hotel.

‘I think it is very irresponsible of whatever company is doing this.’

Helen Morgan, 31, was recently made redundant from her job in housekeeping at a hotel in Exeter. The mother-of-one said: ‘I have experience in quite a few areas of hospitality and thought I’d easily find something.

‘But I’ve been looking for a fortnight without any luck. It doesn’t surprise me that there are jobs being advertised abroad because I meet so many Eastern Europeans in the industry.

‘Most are perfectly nice and friendly and do a good job, but it’s annoying that they’re being recruited over British workers. I think the Government should step in and make sure the ads are placed here too.’

Phil McCabe, of the Forum of Private Business, said: ‘If there are British workers that are ready, willing and skilled enough to do these jobs then it is absolutely right that those jobs should be offered first to British workers.

‘However from talking to  our members, we have found that there is a shortage of skilled workers from the UK, and many people have basic skills lacking such as numeracy and literacy.

‘In addition young people’s attitudes are sometimes found to be lacking, so advertising in Romania possibly reflects this situation.’

There are a host of taxi driving jobs in the South West region being advertised in Romania, but there are 176,000 unemployed people already living there.

Meanwhile in the South East, there are 276,000 jobless, yet seemingly many jobs available for hotel workers.

Across Britain, youth unemployment has exceeded one million for the first time.

TjobsRecruit was founded in 2009 by Calin Stfanescu  and Sebastian Niezgoda. According to its website, it is the largest recruitment ‘system in Central and East European.  The ‘T’, it says, stands for ‘trusted’.
