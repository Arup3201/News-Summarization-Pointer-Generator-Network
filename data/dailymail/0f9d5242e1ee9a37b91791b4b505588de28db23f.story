Holding hands as they made their very first joint appearance on The View this morning, Michelle and Barack Obama candidly spoke about the daily rituals that make their marriage, and tight-knit family, so successful.

While she ruled out a political run because, she says, she lacks the necessary patience, the First Lady revealed how Barack Obama tucks her in at night, after he puts the girls to bed.

She said: 'We do a lot of tucking. The girls will shout from bed "I wanna be tucked!". Then Barack comes in, he'll turn the lights out and we’ll talk. He’s like, "Ready to be tucked?"'

The President also revealed how after nearly 20 years of marriage, their bond is stronger than ever.

He told Barbara Walters: 'I like lavishing her with all kinds of attention when she deserves it. And she always deserves it.'

He added that they spend more time together now, than before they moved into the White house.

'I live above the store,' he said. 'I have a 30 second commute so it's easier to be home in time for dinner.

'After 20 years, you get to a point where the bond and trust you have is so much stronger than when you're just getting to know each other.'

On the subject of his two daughters, he added that Malia, now 14, 'is turning into a night owl like me.'

'They’re now at the point where they still love their daddy, but they come in  strategically,' the President said. 'They’re not being surly or anything, but they’ll give me five minutes and then go.'

He also recounted the moments before he 
took the stage to give his speech at the Democratic National Convention:
'People are whispering in their various headphones and I’m about to go 
on cue. Suddenly I see Sasha and Malia spinning around.'

Mimicking the girls, he continued: 'This is just like in the Hannah 
Montana movie when she’s about to go out on stage and Billy Ray says, "Go get ‘em baby!"'

'And then I had to go out, thinking about Hannah Montana. That’s what was on my mind.'

When it comes to stealing quiet 
moments with his wife, the President revealed when Malia and Sasha 
take Bo, the family dog, out for an after-dinner walk, the couple 'catch
up on serious stuff.'

The serious stuff is something the First Lady says she is glad she doesn't have to deal with directly.

'I have the best job,' she said. 'I love what I do, meeting wonderful people... spending my days hula-hooping. It's hard for me know know what that struggle [as the President] is.'

Mr Obama was also questioned about 
his post-presidential plans. 'What are you going to do with the rest of 
your life?' Ms Walters asked him.

'Well, you know, first things first 
here,' Obama quipped. 'There's all kinds of things I want to do in the 
second term; putting folks back to work, making sure our schools are up 
to snuff.'

Happily married: The President also revealed how after nearly 20 years of marriage, the couple's bond is stronger than ever with Joy Behar, and Sherri Shepherd on The View

The View: After the couple's interview, Michelle Obama twetted: 'We can always count on The View for a great conversation! Thanks for having us. ¿mo'

'And then?' Ms Walters persisted.

'You know, in a post-presidency, the thing that I think I would enjoy most is spending time working with kids,' Mr Obama said.

'I love teaching, I miss teaching, and you know, I'm not sure it would necessarily be in a classroom, but the idea of being able to go around in various cities and helping to create mentorships, and apprenticeships, giving young people the sense of possibility and opportunity, and using whatever spotlight I can to show how much incredible talent there is out there.'

He then touched on the possibility of a President Michelle Obama. 'She should run for office, but she says she doesn't want to,' he said.

'I mean, Michelle would be terrific, but temperamentally I just don't think [she could].'

'Yeah,' the First Lady agreed. 'It takes a lot of patience to be the President of the United States, and I'm not that patient.'
