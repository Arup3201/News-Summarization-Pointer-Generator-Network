Police arrested this Halloween reveller on a DUI charge after receiving reports that a woman had been shot dead in her car in Birmingham, Alabama. She was in fact still in costume while sleeping off a hangover

When police were called to a precinct in Birmingham, Alabama, they expected to make a gruesome discovery.

For a concerned citizen had dialled officers to report what seemed like a dead pregnant woman, slumped over her steering wheel, and covered in blood.

It appeared to the passer-by that she had been shot.

But when police arrived at the scene they were shocked to discover the blood-soaked woman was not dead at all â€“ she was only sleeping.

She had apparently been sleeping off a nightmare Halloween-induced hangover in the comfort of her car, while still dressed as a zombie.

The Birmingham News reported that officers were called to the scene around 8.15am this morning.

Police were responding to the call by the panicked citizen who had dialled 911 described seeing the woman covered in white face paint and fake blood and apparently unresponsive at the wheel parked close to a traffic light.

They were stunned to discover that the redhead who was drenched in fake blood all over her top and around her mouth was in fact only a woman recovering in her car from Halloween festivities the night before.

The pregnancy bump was all part of her costume said officers.

She was woken from her slumber by officers who promptly made her hangover a lot worse as they handcuffed her and took her to the local jail.

It is unclear who the young woman was.

One officer at the scene is reported to have said: 'You can see why someone thought she had been shot.'
