The record number is higher than the first books of veteran authors included JK Rowling and Dan Brown, author of the Da Vinci Code.

The figure is also more than five times higher than the number of copies which were sold of EL James’ Fifty Shades of Grey in its first week.

The figure was revealed by Nielsen BookScan which collects data on book sales.

Zoella’s ‘vlogs’, short for video blogs, attract 12 million hits each month. She began posting the videos in 2009 as a ‘creative outlet’. She now has six million followers on YouTube and is read by more than 2.5 million on Twitter.

Penguin Random House, the publisher behind Girl Online, agreed to sign Zoella after its CEO Tom Weldon was told by his 13-year-old goddaughter that the book would be ‘a huge best-seller’.

Miss Sugg was also an unlikely addition to Band Aid 30 where she joined Bob Geldof and One Direction for the charity single. She also featured in the November issue of Vogue.

Of the record-breaking achievement, Miss Sugg said: ‘It’s such an amazing feeling. I’m so grateful to everyone who has bought a copy of Girl Online. I love that so many of my viewers are enjoying the book! This year has been so exciting and this for sure is the icing on the cake.' 

Ms Sugg's 'vlog' has 12 million viewers a month while an estimated two million people follower her on Twitter
