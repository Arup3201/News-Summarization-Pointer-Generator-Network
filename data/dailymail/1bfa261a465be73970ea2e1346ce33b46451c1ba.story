An Oscar-winning screenwriter accused of strangling a
young actress with his belt during a sadistic sex session is reportedly trying to dismiss the $5 million civil lawsuit she brought against him.

Amanda Jencsik, 26, claimed in the suit filed in March that she feared 
for her life during an abusive four-month relationship with Moonstruck 
writer John Patrick Shanley, 61.

Miss Jencsik alleged he slapped her and held his hands over her mouth and neck during their 
encounters at his Manhattan apartment, and he often asked her if she felt like he was raping her.

Now his lawyers have filed a motion to dismiss her lawsuit, arguing that she willingly returned to him for sex, the New York Post reported.

A representative for Jencsik's attorney told the Post that a motion to dismiss the suit was argued a month ago, yet lawyers are still waiting for a decision from the judge.

The spokesperson added: 'Our client is a student and an actress. She kept going back to Shanley's house because he had control over her, he would brag about all the people he knew and how he could help her career.

'She looked up to him as a mentor and he continued to take advantage of her.'

A lawyer for Shanley, who wrote the 1987 Cher 
film, did not return a request for comment. His other work includes the play Doubt, which won a Pulitzer Prize before he directed a movie version starring Meryl Streep in 2008.

In her suit, Brooklyn-born Jencsik
claimed their rough sex sessions were so violent that she believed Mr 
Shanley was trying to kill her and grew light-headed when he wrapped the
belt around her neck.

She said she suffered severe physical 
and psychological trauma, but did not report him to the police 'due to 
her mental state'. She continues to undergo therapy, her lawyer's 
representative said.

Miss
Jencsik's statement says the pair met via Facebook in October 2009, 
with Mr Shanley striking up the correspondence by asking her about her 
hair colour.

They did not meet in person until a dinner date in January 2010, she claims.

She alleges that, after a second date later that month, she followed Mr Shanley to his apartment and they had sex.

He invited her back the next day but was not home when she arrived, the suit says.

When he eventually showed up he was drunk, Miss Jencsik alleges, and once inside he 'forcibly turned [her] over onto her stomach' and sodomised her.

Though she told Mr Shanley he was 
hurting her he laughed, the suit says, and afterwards he complained that
his sheets had been left stained with her blood and makeup.

The third and final time they had sex, she says, Mr Shanley sodomised her again - this time looping the belt around her throat.

After she split up with him in April 2010, Jencsik claims she was in pain but too scared to seek medical help. It took her a year to approach a doctor, who diagnosed her with a bowel obstruction, the suit said.
