Shoppers flocked to the grand opening of a city's first daily cannabis market yesterday months after Washington state voted to legalize the drug.

Northwest Cannabis Market in Seattle is now open seven days a week selling medicinal marijuana, as well as other dried medicines and edible products.

Medicinal sellers are expecting to see business grow as some move into the recreational market after both Washington and Seattle voted to legalize marijuana - the first to do so in the United States.

Last fall, voters in Washington passed Initiative 502, which legalizes the possession of up to one ounce of marijuana for adults aged over 21.

The state has also called for the creation of state-licensed pot growers, processors and retail stores.

At Northwest Cannabis Market, shoppers on mobility scooters and wheelchairs browsed jars filled with various types of marijuana.

Nine permanent vendors are stationed at the market to sell their wares and others set up on irregular days.

The market even has a marijuana smoking room where customers can try out different types.

Shoppers need to show their doctor's authorisation and Washington State identification in order to buy cannabis.

The state's medical marijuana industry is continuing to operate with recreational cannabis sales expected to start later this year.

In December, hundreds of people gathered in Seattle to mark the moment the drug became legal in Washington.

Colorado followed suit in January.

Washington's law forbid smoking cannabis in public but many openly smoke on the streets.

People can be fined in a similar way to people caught drinking in public.

Fishmonger Justin Hall told CBCLocal: '[The law] doesn't stop anybody that much right now.'
