Charges: Fount Duston has been charged by Ardmore, Oklahoma police with the rape and kidnapping of a seven-year-old girl

A 34-year-old man has been charged with the abduction and rape of a seven-year-old girl after she was dramatically found in his Oklahoma trailer on Sunday - a little over 24 hours after she was abducted in broad-daylight outside her home.

Fount Duston, who in a series of disturbing YouTube videos describes himself as a DJ and trucker, was taken into custody at 9.40pm after a statewide amber alert led to an anonymous tip.

Police in Ardmore said there was a brief struggle at Duston's door when he answered with a shotgun, but authorities were able to force their way inside and rescue the little girl.

Duton was booked into Carter County Jail on first-degree rape and kidnapping charges and the girl was taken to an undisclosed medical facility.

Her name and her family's identity are no longer being published following her rescue because she was the victim of a sexual assault.

The girl's mother is at her daughter's bedside and has been with her during the interview process with the police.

'At least God brought my baby home. She's coming home,' said the girl's father to News9. 'We've had a lot of people and family out looking for my daughter and thank God they found her and she's OK.'

Witnesses to the abduction said they saw Duston drive up outside the seven-year-old's front-yeard where she was playing, force her into his car and just drove off.

'It just shouldn't have happened. It shouldn't have happened at all,' said the father to News9. 'Children should not have to go through that.'

Immediately an amber alert was issued statwide for the girl and within 24 hours she was found.

'Obviously, as police officers, when we have these types of calls, they're our worst nightmare too. We want to find them as quick as we can. We understand what the statistics say about abductions,' said Capt. Eric Hamblin with Ardmore Police Department to News9.

The little girl's father agreed.

'We're lucky that she was found in the situation she was found in and that she's still alive,' the father said.

After his arrest, disturbing YouTube footage and social media postings from Duston were discovered.

Originally from Marietta, Oklahoma, Duston appears in a series of YouTube videos on his own channel in which he identifies himself as a Mobile DJ with a love of House Music.

'Hello everybody and welcome to our YouTube. My name is Fount Duston. I’m a DJ. I live in Marietta, OK,' said Duston.

Channel: Fount Duston's YouTube videos are a series of DJ mixes and him giving his opinions on various matterrs

Over the course of the videos, Duston discusses his skills as a DJ, plays with a monkey puppet, films himself ordering donuts and has a very lewd conversation with another friend.

On his Facebook, Duston has posted at least one anti-law enforcement video and disturbingly linked to the GoFundMe page for a little girl in need of cancer treatment.

The girl on Duston's Facebook is not the same girl that he kidnapped.

Shockingly, a search online and through court records reveals no prior criminal convictions for Duston in Oklahoma and Ardmore police have said that they don't think he has a criminal record.

'We know she's probably been traumatized and we just want complete healing,” said Gaylon Taylor, a relative of the victim to News9.
