A drunken passenger was forced to clean up his own mess after he urinated in front of other travellers on an internal flight in South Africa.

The Mango Airlines plane was flying from Port Elizabeth to Johannesburg on Sunday when the man pulled down his trousers and relieved himself in the aircraft’s galley.

But the cabin crew didn’t let him off easy – in addition to being ordered to clean up after himself he was detained by police when the flight landed at OR Tambo International Airport.

Mango Airlines spokesman Hein Kaiser told The Herald that the man wanted to use the toilet during take-off, but was told he had to remain in his seat until it was safe to move about the cabin.

That’s when he went to the galley and relieved himself next to the seated cabin crew in full view of other passengers, she claimed.

He was forced to return to his seat after resisting and searing at flight attendants and the captain of the flight.

Passenger Samantha Meyer told The Herald that the man’s indecent behaviour and the delay it caused were distressing.

She said: ‘We had already been forced to wait at the [Port Elizabeth] airport for two hours due to the bad weather which had delayed flights, but when we landed in Johannesburg, we were all told to stay seated while the man and his belongings were removed from the aircraft.'

Ms Meyer added that her boyfriend had also needed to use the toilet, but waited patiently until the right time.

Ms Kaiser said the airline doesn’t tolerate such behaviour, adding: ‘Moving around the cabin during turbulence presents opportunity for personal injury as well as endangering fellow guests and flight crew on board.

‘When the commander of a flight advises travellers to fasten their seatbelts, it is for good reason and is standard operating procedure on airlines the world over.’
