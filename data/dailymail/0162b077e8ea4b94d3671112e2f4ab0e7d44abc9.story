A Wheel of Fortune contestant left viewers stunned on Friday night as he solved every puzzle in the main game to take home a record-breaking $91,892 prize fund.

Matt DeSanto, an operations manager from Pennsylvania, even managed to guess a three-word conundrum with just one letter on the board.

Seconds after Vanna White revealed an 'E' to players, DeSanto buzzed in and correctly identified The Lone Ranger as the blanked out film character.

Natural talent: The Rutgers Business School graduate said that he didn't do any special training for his appearance, only some 'extra crosswords'

A video clip from the episode, shows Wheel of Fortune host Pat Sajak's gobsmacked reaction.

'I don't want to cause trouble at home but I still think there's a connection between you and Vanna,' the TV personality says trying to explain DeSanto's faultless run of guesses.

The father-of-two first solved 'Peaches And Cream' with just the 'S' in 'Peaches' and the 'C,' 'R,' and 'M,' in 'Cream'.

He then went on to rule the entire game, plucking out answers before any of the other contestants were able to take their turns. 

The Rutgers Business School graduate told Today.com that he didn't do any special training for his appearance, only some 'extra crosswords.'

However, he has been a fan of the show since the age of five and watched hundreds of episodes over the years.

DeSanto is reportedly the first Wheel of Fortune player to break the $70,000 mark before  the bonus round. Unfortunately for him, that's where his luck ran out.

Caught on camera: Many viewers have been congratulating the Wheel of Fortune star on social media after watching him in action

He was unable to get the final bonus round clue 'wooden gavel', which prevented him from scoring the one million dollar prize.  

Along with winning a considerable sum of money, DeSanto also secured a trip to Mississippi in round two, and a week-long vacation to Jamaica in round three.

Many viewers have been congratulating the Wheel of Fortune star on social media after watching him in action.

One fan wrote on Facebook: 'Without a doubt, I absolutely loved Matt's style; he dominated this game, solving all those puzzles winning lots of money, and I especially loved his attitude in the bonus despite not getting "WOODEN GAVEL."'

'Matt is now officially one of my top favorite WoF players!! Congrats Matt! Enjoy your winnings and keep up the good work in all you do!'
