Michael Jordan has asked a Georgia court to dismiss a lawsuit filed against him by a woman who says the NBA hall of famer is the father of her 16-year-old son.

Jordan's lawyer John Mayoue said in the document filed Monday in Fulton County Superior Court that the six-time NBA champion is not the father of Pamela Smith's son. Jordan accused her of making false claims against him.

The NBA's Charlotte Bobcats majority owner said the paternity of the teen has already been 'conclusively established' in divorce filings between Smith and her ex-husband.

Jordan, 50, released a statement to 
The Associated Press on Monday through his spokeswoman Estee Portnoy 
saying, 'Public records show that the paternity of the child was 
established in a prior case in this same court many years ago and that 
Michael Jordan is not the father.

'He also filed a counterclaim seeking 
sanctions for the false claims made against him. It is unfortunate that 
well-known figures are the target of these kind of claims. Michael 
Jordan will vigorously defend himself and his reputation.'

Jordan's response to Smith's Feb. 6 lawsuit said her suit is a 'shameless, bad faith attempt to abuse the legal system.'

Last week Smith claimed that she only decided to sue the star only after
 her 16-year-old son, Taj, begged her to file the suit.

The
 teen, who uses the surname Jordan, has in the past taken to the 
internet to insist that the former Chicago Bulls star is his father.

According to TMZ, the woman was 
hesitant to bring Jordan's name through the mud but her teenage son 
begged his mother do everything she could to get Jordan to acknowledge 
that the boy was his son.

In
 the legal documents, she claims that she and Mr Jordan had sex in 1995,
 when he was married to Juanita Vanoy, with whom he has three children.

She says her son Grant Pierce Jay Jordan Reynolds, known as Taj, was born in June 1996.

Ms
 Smith insists that Mr Jordan is the boy's father, and argues in the 
court documents that he should be forced to undergo a paternity test and pay child support.

She also requested the boy's last name be changed to Jordan, and for a judge to order the Georgia Department of Vital Records to issue him a new birth certificate.

The lawsuit requests that any hearing or trial be conducted in closed court to protect the teen's privacy.

However, Smith's publicist acknowledged that the teen posted a video to YouTube on Dec. 25, saying Jordan is his father and that he wants him to play a larger role in his life.

'Pamela had no choice but to support 
her son and his desire to forge a relationship with his father,' Smith's
 publicist, April Love, said in a statement Friday. 'That's why she is 
now speaking out and prompting Michael to do the right thing.'

Love said Smith, 48, and Jordan met 
in Chicago in the late 1980s. According to court documents, Smith does 
not have an attorney. A court date is scheduled for Tuesday, March 12.

The star remains one of the most 
recognized sports figures in the world nearly 10 years after his 
retirement from the NBA and is considered by many to be the greatest basketball player of all time.

He was a 14-time NBA all-star, won six championships with the Chicago Bulls and was named the finals MVP six times.

On March 17, 2010, the NBA Board of 
Governors unanimously approved Jordan's purchase of the Bobcats, making 
him the first former NBA player ever to become the majority owner of a 
league franchise.

This is not the first time he has been 
the subject of a paternity suit - in 1991, his former lover Karla Knafel
 claimed the star was the father of her child, but a DNA test proved 
that this was not the case.
