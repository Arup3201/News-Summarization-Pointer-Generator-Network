Ahead of the second semi-final, MARTIN KEOWN runs the rule over Argentina and Holland as both nations bid to face Germany in the World Cup final.

They have been two of the stand-out players at the tournament and Lionel Messi and Arjen Robben go head to head. Whichever team stops the other’s star man will go a long way to reaching the final. With three central defenders, the temptation for Holland is to send one after Messi, but these days he is doing much more of his work in a deeper position.

Shining light: Lionel Messi has been one of the players of the World Cup, helping Argentina to the last four

D(r)iving force: Arjen Robben has been magnificent for Holland

That responsibility has to be passed to 
the midfielders and they have to close him down quickly. You rarely see 
man-marking these days but if any manager is going to try something 
different, it’s Louis van Gaal.

The structure of the Dutch team seems better than Argentina’s and they work the ball more patiently. Then when it reaches the front three the pace quickens.

Robben is ruthless when he isolates defenders and as effective as Messi one-on-one.

Defenders can’t afford to dive in against him because if a foot is offered, Robben will go over it.

Messi has dragged this Argentina team through but he performs much better when his fellow strikers are firing.

Gonzalo Higuain finally came to the party with that fine finish against Belgium and Messi always looks better with a partner in crime.

He has a big role to play, though I’m sure Alejandro Sabella would like to be able to have Sergio Aguero back in his side soon.

This will be a close game but I think the Dutch will go through, thanks in part to their inspirational manager. Van Gaal got his players together early to prepare for the World Cup and he pays such attention to detail.

His decision to bring on Tim Krul against Costa Rica for the penalties was inspired. Everything has been going Van Gaal’s way so he may feel cocky enough to try another tactical tweak tonight.  I’ve been impressed by his coaching staff, too — they are his lieutenants on the sidelines, all playing individual roles and feeding him information. That way his head isn’t buried in a notebook and he can focus on the game and his tactics.

One of the most interesting things about this World Cup has been the flexible systems and the refusal of players to be pigeon-holed. Dirk Kuyt has played in three positions and excelled in them all. He has been magnificent as a wing back but his experience as a striker also gives him a creative and attacking edge.

Martin Demichelis is unrecognisable from the Manchester City defender of last season, with his flowing locks long gone. He was impressive against Belgium, dealing well with their more direct approach, but against the speed of Robben and Co, it will be a different test altogether.

But Van Gaal is a footballing genius and his nous can steer the Dutch through for a repeat of the 1974 World Cup final
