A man is due to face court charged with the rape of a girl on a train travelling between Sydney and Penrith earlier this month.

The Rosehill man, 30, was arrested on May 7 in Harris Park and has since been charged with 'sexual intercourse without consent,' a police spokeswoman confirmed.

Penrith crime manager inspector Grant Healey renewed appeals for witnesses pictured in CCTV released by police to come forward and stressed: 'They were probably doing the right thing.'

About the investigation, insp Healey could not reveal extensive detail but said 'it was one of those tricky ones.'

The suspect will face Penrith local court on 10 July. Police said 'it's worth noting the witnesses did not see the alleged offence but may have seen either the man or the woman in the lead up.'

Investigators earlier released images of the men in the hope that they come forward to explain what, if anything, they witnessed during the attack on her way home from a night out in Sydney's notorious Kings Cross on Saturday, May 3.

Insp Healey renewed those appeals and still wished to speak with the witnesses.

The woman was heading to Penrith after first catching a 4.40am train from Kings Cross to Central station.

At some point on the journey she was allegedly attacked and sexually assaulted by a 30-year-old man. The woman reported the alleged assault when she reached her destination at Penrith station.

Police are seeking up to four people, including the men pictured, who could have unwittingly witnessed the attack on the 21-year-old woman

Police believe as many as four people could have witnessed the alleged attack and are appealing for them to come forward.

CCTV images show the first possible witnesses to be two young men aged between 20 and 30.

The pair are seen in the footage sitting near each other on separate rows before making their way off the train together.

One of the men was wearing a patterned maroon long sleeve shirt, black pants and trainers.

One of the possible witnesses, pictured standing, is believed to be between 25 and 40 and was seen wearing a black and green jacket, white shirt, blue jeans, black and white trainers

The second man was wearing a large beige jacket over a white shirt, black pants and back and white trainers.

A third possible witness is believed to be between 25 and 40 and was seen wearing a black and green jacket, white shirt, blue jeans, black and white trainers and carrying a blue bag.

The fourth witness is a woman wearing black clothing. Police stress that none of the witnesses were involved in the incident, and may have unwittingly been present when the attack occurred.

Penrith Inspector Harry Goeding said the assault was a serious incident, the Daily Telegraph reported.

He also highlighted how brazen the attack was, pointing out that even late-night trains are busy as they brought people back to the western suburbs after a night out in the city.

Anyone with information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 and information can be given anonymously.
