A five-foot alligator has been evicted from a Florida home after police found the reptile living in a children's paddling pool - in a 600 square feet apartment.

The alligator, named Snappy by its owner April Rognlin, was kept as a pet along with her three dogs.

Mrs Rognlin, who had cared for Snappy in her apartment in Ocean Shores, Grays Harbor County, Washington for almost seven years, was stopped by police following objections from her landlord.

Time for a walk? Snappy the alligator was seized from an Ocean Shores apartment in Washington after a tip off from its owner's landlord

Police in Ocean Shores, some 130 miles from Seattle, said that they seized the reptile following a tip off from the property's owner.

They found Snappy in the back seat of Mrs Rognlin's vehicle.

The reptile also had its own rockery alongside the paddling pool and lived happily alongside the three dogs.

But the terms of Mrs Rognlin's lease did not allow her to keep the 'pet' and ownership of an American Black alligator is also against Washington law, police said.

Mrs Roglin said Snappy 'is just like a dog or a cat'. She told King 5 News: 'He is part of the family, I've had him forever.'

She said that, despite the fact that alligators are known for their powerful jaws, Snappy 'wouldn't hurt anyone' and said that handing the reptile over 'broke my heart'.

Snappy is now being cared for at Thurston County Animal Shelter and the shelter are looking for a permanent home in a reptile refuge.
