Arrest: Dionisio Lockridge, 22, who's not a student at the high school, has been charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine

A 22-year-old man has been arrested after nine Florida high school students were hospitalized after eating brownies laced with unidentified drugs.

Dionisio Lockridge, who's not a student at the school,  has been charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine after a search of his Miami home turned up brownies similar to the ones eaten by the students, officials said.

Paramedics were called to Miami Coral Park Senior High School on Thursday shortly after classes started when several students complained of feeling ill.

'One girl was having a seizure. I 
haven’t spoken to her, but hopefully she’s doing OK,' Samantha Melgar, a
student at the school told CBS 4.

'They told me the brownies had coke, heroin, steroids, all kinds of drugs,' Danivellis Torres also told CBS.

Police
are now conducting tests to identify the substance in the brownies that
sickened the students, said John Schuster, a spokesman for the 
Miami-Dade County public school system.

Emergency: Paramedics were called to Miami Coral Park Senior High School on Thursday shortly after classes started when several students complained of feeling ill, in all hospitalizing nine

Substance: What was in the drugs was not immediately known though a search of Lockridge's home turned up marijuana and cocaine according to authorities

Recounts: One student claims another had suffered a seizure after consuming the brownies that various students say were being sold and given by more than one person on the campus

It's
still not entirely clear Lockridge's connection to the school, with 
mixed recounts by the students on how the brownies were distributed.

'It was just a male who randomly approached me and said, "Do you want one?"' Ashley Robleto told CBS Miami. 'I found it very suspicious. I was like, I shouldn’t take this.'

'They were selling it all over school they were knocking on classroom doors asking if they could sell what they had,' Student Danni Valdez Torres told WSVN.

'If you have consumed a brownie in school today, please report to room 4215. Immediately!!' a Twitter message by the school read that afternoon.

Connections: It's still not entirely clear Lockridge's connection to the school, pictured, with mixed recounts by the students on how the brownies were distributed

‘What's going here?’ an upset parent outside the school on Thursday asked WSVN. ‘Where's the control? Where is the safety for our kids?’

‘I don’t feel safe about my kids in school,’ parent Norris Bell told CBS.
