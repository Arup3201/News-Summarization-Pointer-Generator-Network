Using touch screen computers has helped a group of monkeys relax, a new study has found.

Interacting with the touchscreen machines not only interests and challenges the animals, but keeps dominant members of the group busy, which mirrors life in the wild and relieves social tension.

Researchers studied a social group of Sulawesi crested macaques at Marwell Wildlife, Hampshire, to come up with their findings.

Researchers studied a social group of Sulawesi crested macaques at Marwell Wildlife Park to come up with their findings. Here, one of the dominant monkeys relaxes by playing with the touchscreen

The scientists, from the University of Portsmouth, taught the rare monkeys to operate computer touchscreens so they could conduct studies to understand the animals' cognition and communication.

The researchers found that providing cognitive challenges for the macaques, using touchscreen computers, has improved the group’s cohesion and reduced tensions while increasing friendly behaviour.

Lead scientist on the study, Jamie Whitehouse, from the university’s Department of Psychology, said: 'Having one individual leave the group mimics conditions in the wild when it’s common for a lone macaque to break off and return later.

Natural habitat: Tropical forest and mangrove swamps

Diet: Bark, roots, bulbs, fruit and leaves; also, insects and other invertebrates, small reptiles and birds’ eggs

Behaviour: The monkeys live in small groups on the forest floor. They signal to one another by using a variety of calls, facial expressions and by raising and lowering their crests

Threats: Hunting for food and habitat destruction

'At Marwell it’s usually the dominant macaques leaving the group to use the touchscreens, which leaves the others to enjoy some time without the top ranking animals.'

Just like humans and many other primates, macaques use complex social interactions.

Sulawesi crested macaques, native to Indonesia, employ sophisticated and subtle communication techniques, relying on many different facial expressions, body positioning and vocalisations to make themselves understood, according to the study published in the journal PLOS ONE.

Mr Whitehouse said: 'We can use our understanding of their social behaviour to work out whether taking part in the studies is affecting their welfare.'

The research shows that when dominant individuals leave the group, the ‘lipsmacking’ behaviour of the other macaques increases – where they protrude their lips and then smack them together repeatedly.

The monkeys were able to choose between images and videos of their species displaying different facial expressions

Mr Whitehouse said: 'This behaviour is a friendly gesture between the macaques, which they use to maintain their social bonds.

'The fact that this increases on days when they are taking part in our studies, shows that our research is having a positive effect on the group.'

The macaques live in their social group and can voluntarily enter a specialised research area, separate from the researcher.

The animals are free to end the sessions whenever they like and return to their daily activities. They receive food treats – tiny amounts of healthy titbits – when they take part in the studies.

The scientists plan on using their understanding of the monkey's social behaviour to work out whether taking part in the studies is affecting their welfare
