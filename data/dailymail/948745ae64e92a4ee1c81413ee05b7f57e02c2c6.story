This is the heart-wrenching moment a dying wife renewed her wedding vows in a moving ceremony on her 60th wedding anniversary - with just days left to live.

Brave Janet Jones, 79, was diagnosed with terminal cancer earlier this year but vowed to stay alive long enough to see her diamond wedding anniversary.

And yesterday her dying wish was realised as she renewed her vows with beloved husband Gethin, 85, at Compton Hospice in Wolverhampton.

Mrs Jones said her husband had always been 'so kind to me' and she couldn't imagine her life without him

Close friends and family members all attended the ceremony 60 years to the day that the couple first tied the knot in 1954.

Pictures taken at the service show the couple still very much in love, holding hands and cuddling one another. Others show a frail Mrs Jones grinning from a hospice chair.

Mrs Jones said her life now feels 'complete' after defiantly vowing she 'wasn't going anywhere' until she had celebrated her wedding anniversary.

She said: 'They can keep knocking that door, but I said I am not going anywhere until I have seen our diamond wedding anniversary.

'And depending how I feel, I might even stay a few days longer. I now feel my life is complete.

'If the good Lord will give me a little more time to tell everybody how much I love them.

'I would very much like that, but if not, I will thank him for the time he has given me with Gethin.

'He has always been so kind to me and has always looked after me.

'I've loved every second with Gethin, I can't imagine having my life without him.

'I know the time will come soon when I am away from Gethin for a bit, and I know he will miss me.

'But I know one day we will all be back together again.'

The pair met at a dance in Willenhall, West Midlands, and got married at St Anne's Church in the town on June 26, 1954.

They didn't have any children and devoted their lives to running a baby clothing shop in the town.

Speaking about how they first met, Mrs Jones told how she threw a custard pie in the face of another girl who was eyeing up her husband-to-be.

She said: 'There was another girl, Hazel, who had eyes for him.

'I told her to stay away because I wanted him, but she said 'We'll see about that'.

Mrs Jones then left the room and brought a large custard pie. When she returned she asked Hazel if she liked the desert, and she replied 'yes'.

Mrs Jones said: 'Then I splattered the pie in her face and said 'Well try that one for size and don't come back here again'.

'Later my Gethin told me I needn't have worried because I was his light and shining star and that I was the one he wanted, and no one else.'

Mrs Jones has asked her nephew Ralph and his wife Lynn to keep her ashes until her husband's death.

She said: 'When my Gethin is ready to come to me, they are going to put our ashes together and take them to Barmouth where we loved to go.

'The ashes will be thrown into the sea and nobody will ever part us again.'
