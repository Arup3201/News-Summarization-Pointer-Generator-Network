The crime spree spanned 130 miles and began Tuesday afternoon when the suspect robbed a bank in the tiny town of Wausaukee, Wisconsin, police say

'Trooper Trevor Casper was killed while bravely serving his community and doing his duty to keep our citizens safe. Tonette and I are praying for Trooper Casper's family and our thoughts are with them and the broader law enforcement community at this difficult time,' Governor Scott Walker said in statement. 

The 21-year-old from Kiel had only just graduated from the Wisconsin State Patrol academy in December. 

The suspect, who has not yet been named, started his crime spree 130 miles north of Fon du Lac in the tiny town of Wausaukee about 1.45pm, police believe. 

He walked into in State Bank of Florence, fired a shot and made off with an undisclosed amount of cash. He then stole a bank teller's car and fled. 

Shortly after the robbery, police discovered a man in his 60s dead in his car on the highway out of town. They believe he was killed by the suspect in a botched carjacking.

Police swarmed the scene in the quiet city of Fond du Lac. Witnesses describe hearing 10 to 15 gunshots

About 4.30pm, police in Fond du Lac got a call about a robbery at Hometown Bank. The suspect made off with cash and no one was hurt. 

A description of the robbery's getaway car was broadcast on police radio. 

Casper, who rushed to the area, spotted and tailed the car. 

Witnesses tell the Record newspaper that they saw a man jump out of his vehicle and open fire at Casper and then run around behind a Pick 'n Save clothing store. 

The trooper followed the suspect in hot pursuit.  

'The shots were so fast it had to have been a semi-automatic weapon or something. I'd say maybe 10 to 15 shots,' witness Mark Stevens told the Record. 

'The police were coming down and the guy jumped out of his car and it landed up here on the curb and he took off the store and the cops started trying to get everyone away from the entrance to the parking lot.' 

Fond du Lac Police Chief William Lamb said Tuesday night: 'Both the trooper and the suspect were killed in the exchange of gunfire.'
