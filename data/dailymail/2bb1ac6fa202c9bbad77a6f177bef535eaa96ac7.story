A social experiment that brought together an enthusiastic hunter and a passionate vegan ended with some highly emotional and uncomfortable moments and a mutual agreement to disagree.

Steve Lee, from Parkes in New South Wales, is an enthusiastic gun collector – with over 300 in his collection - who performs contract shooting at farms where wild pigs have become pests. He's also an avid hunter who spends a couple of days a month participating in the sport.

Mr Lee spent 10 days with animal liberationist Felicity Andersen, who lives at Animal Liberation's headquarters in Victoria, as part of SBS's Living With The Enemy. 

The duo spent five days together in each of their homes, participating in the others' favourite activities and attempting to gain an insight into the other side of the hunting debate.

Steve Lee, an enthusiastic hunter and gun collector from New South Wales, spent ten days with Felicity Andersen, a member of Animal Liberation and a passionate vegan from Victoria 

Their first activity was a duck shooting protest in Victoria, where the government encourages hunters to take part in each year. Despite standing onside with the animal activists, Mr Lee was less concerned about the ducks, and more so about the hunters.

'When I first went down there I went on a duck shooting protest with them and I was taken aback by how horrible they are to the hunters and how derogatory they are, the way they torment them,' Mr Lee told Daily Mail Australia.

'Their approach appeared to me as quite vicious, the way they attack the hunters, and they act like their opinion is the gospel truth.'

He suggested that the activists instigate violence among the shooters before pointing the finger back at them.

Ms Andersen's account of the event was entirely different. The 41-year-old said Mr Lee was visibly uncomfortable while surrounded by the large group of activists who were 'emotionally charged'; particularly while attempting to revive one of the ducks that had been shot.

Ms Andersen said that Mr Lee, who works as a pest eradicator at farms across NSW where wild pigs are a concern, told her following the duck hunting protest: 'I'd like to take up duck shooting'

'Everyone was quite sensitive and he was quite uncomfortable with that,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'He tried to make light of it by making a few jokes and when I asked him what he felt about the rescue he just said: "I'd like to take up duck shooting".

'So he was quite callous, but I understand because even if he did have a tiny change of heart he wouldn't want to admit it.'

In contrast, when spending time at Mr Lee's property, the duo took part in Felicity's first ever pig hunt.

'I had every intention of sabotaging the hunt, but I failed,' Ms Andersen said.

Inside Mr Lee's trophy room: Mr Lee said he believes Ms Andersen would have 'rather hung around with a goat  than with me'

'I was going to make sure I made lots of noise so that any wild creatures around knew we were there and if I'd seen any animals I would have stood between them and Steve, but unfortunately two pigs lost their lives towards the end of the hunt. 

'For the rest of my days I will regret having let my guard down for those two moments.

'Steve's reaction when the pigs were killed was gleeful. He was excited and it was horrifying to see people so happy about a death.'

Both Steve and Felicity said that despite having different opinions on hunting, they managed to generally get along.

However, Mr Lee said he believed the hunting experience 'really hurt' Ms Andersen, adding 'I felt a bit sorry for her.' 

While Ms Andersen also admitted that she got along with Mr Lee, she said she was personally offended when he brought meat into her home, saying she believed it was 'disrespectful' 

'I don't think she enjoyed who I was or my life, she's so anti-hunting that she couldn't get past it,' he said.

'I think she'd rather hang around with a goat or something than with me, and I'm not joking.'

While Ms Andersen also admitted that she got along with Mr Lee, she said she was personally offended when he brought meat into her home.

'I didn't think I'd need to spell that out to him and I found it quite disrespectful and wondered if it was intentional,' she said.

Overall, Mr Lee said he would do it all again but that his opinion of vegans had been greatly lowered after the experience.

'I'm more opposed to veganism than I ever have been now and I don't like their approach or their view of the world. They won't wavier either side, there's no compromise – it's more like a religion than a belief,' he said.

'I'm more opposed to veganism than I ever have been now and I don't like their approach or their view of the world,' Mr Lee said after the whole experience 

He said that it was Mr Andersen's opposition to pest eradication – such as that of wild pigs or foxes – and her suggestion to sterilise them instead which 'made no sense'.

'I have shot foxes many times for eradication purposes - they are very detrimental to Australian wildlife and native mammals and birds and in Victoria the government has even put out a bounty on them,' he said.

'I talked to her about it but she just doesn't want us killing foxes at all. I said to her that one fox kills hundreds of thousands of Australian animals in its lifetime so I've done what you want me to do which is to save those animals, but no. There is no sense to her argument.' 

'I told her that if you don't eat cattle then cattle won't live at all, and she was fine with that. I have a real problem with that because hunters want to maintain a species of animal. 

Ms Andersen said that she doesn't believe violent measures are ever acceptable in pest eradication, saying: 'just as we wouldn't cull human beings when they are by far the most destructive species on the planet'

'Hunters hunt for the sake of being able to come back and next year and hunt again - unless were trying to specifically eradicate a pest our idea is to harvest an animal for meat or occasionally for trophy heads - but there's not a lot of that' 

When she was asked by Daily Mail Australia on her view of pest eradication, Ms Andersen said that she doesn't believe violent measures are ever acceptable.

'Just as we wouldn't cull human beings when they are by far the most destructive species on the planet, I give all other species the same right,' she said.

Living With The Enemy airs at 8.30pm on Wednesday, 8 October on SBS ONE.
