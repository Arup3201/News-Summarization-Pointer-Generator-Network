Two-time Olympian Hope Solo appeared in court to get assault charges dismissed on Monday, after allegedly getting into a fight at her half-sister's house last June.

The 32-year-old soccer star is accused of beating up her half-sister and nephew in a drunken brawl, when she allegedly went over to the sibling's house to complain about her husband who was 'being a jerk'.

But today, Solo and husband Jerramy Stevens put on a united front as they attended the brief hearing, which set up a new court date for November. They even smiled and held hands as they exited Kirkland, Washington municipal court.

Stevens is a former tight end who played for the Seattle Seahawks and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Solo has helped the U.S. Women's National Soccer Team win two gold medals at the Olympics and currently plays goalie for the Seattle Reign.

Better now: Solo is accused of beating her half-sister and 17-year-nephew up in a drunken rage last June. According to the affidavit, Solo went over to her sisters house to complain about her husband who was being a 'jerk'. Above, Solo and her husband in court on Monday

According to the police affidavit, Solo went over to her half-sister's home 'upset about the fact that her husband refused to take her to catch a flight because he was being a jerk.'

The siblings proceeded to start drinking wine and Solo apparently became intoxicated.

At some point, Solo thought her 17-year-old nephew was insulting her so she told him he was 'too fat and crazy' to be a professional athlete.

The nephew went into another room where Solo continued to berate him, calling him a 'fat p****' when he called his mom, according to police documents obtained by TMZ.

'I then told her to get her c*** face out of my house' the boy told police.

Solo went on the offensive and stared punching her nephew and grabbing his hair.

When the boy's mother intervened, Solo lashed out at her as well, punching her several times.

Solo finally let up and left the house when the nephew called police.

Responding officers noted that the boy had redness on one cheek and was bleeding from a cut on the ear, wearing a torn shirt. A bruise on Solo's sister's cheekbone was turning purple. TMZ later obtained pictures of the injuries.

Solo has pleaded not guilty to charges of domestic violence.

Her lawyer hopes to get the charges dropped at the next hearing on November 4.

The soccer player apologized for her very public arrest on Facebook, explaining that her family has had troubles in the past.

'I understand that, as a public figure, I am held to a higher standard of conduct,' she wrote. 'I take seriously my responsibilities as a role model and sincerely apologize to everyone I have disappointed.'

She went on to say she was confident her named would be cleared.

This isn't the first time Solo and Stevens have been embroiled in controversy.

Stevens was arrested just before their wedding in 2012 for assault after a disturbance involving Solo, but he was not charged.

Solo said soon afterward that there never was an assault and that she and her new husband were happy.

'It's unfortunate what the media can do to judge before the facts are out there. It's hard to see, but it's a hard truth, and it's part of life,' she said at the time. 'I'm happy. I'm happily married. I would never stand for domestic violence. I've never been hit in my life.'

Solo is due back in court on November 4.
