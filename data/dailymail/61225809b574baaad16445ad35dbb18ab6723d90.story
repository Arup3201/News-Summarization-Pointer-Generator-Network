Middle class jobs are under grave threat from advances in technology, a former senior adviser to David Cameron is warning.

White collar posts in areas such as law, medicine and accounting are increasingly being replaced by computers, according to Rohan Silva, an ex-Number Ten strategist.

He warned politicians were ‘all over the place’ in their responses to the squeeze on the middle classes and were failing to address the ‘actual causes’.

Jobs are being created at the bottom end of the income scale – in areas such as retail and social care – and at the top, but too few in the middle, Mr Silva, who is now chairman of the Year of Code, a national campaign to promote computer science and technology skills, told the Daily Mail.

He pointed to the example of the Nissan factory in Sunderland, which produces more than 500,000 cars a year and is one of the most productive in Europe. Its use of modern robotics means it employs only about 6,000 workers, far fewer than would have been needed just a few decades ago.

In China, the electronics firm Foxconn recently announced plans to buy an ‘army’ of more than a million robots to replace most of its human workers.

‘Take legal services - text-analysing and data-mining software is doing the work of paralegals, or the accounting profession, in which algorithms are taking over from human auditors,’ he added.

In the future, driverless vehicles are already being tested – which will eliminate many more jobs, while computers were also being used to diagnose medical conditions and carry out stock-market trading.

Mr Silva said the Government urgently needed to do more to prepare middle-class people for jobs in IT and technology - a key growth area

Mr Silva said the Government urgently needed to do more to prepare middle-class people for jobs in IT and technology – a key growth area.

‘This is either the biggest threat to jobs in the UK or it’s the biggest opportunity,’ he claimed.

He said the trend had ‘profound implications’ for society. ‘If you look at the UK and look at the US, there is a stagnation in middle class incomes.

‘There are more jobs at the top and more jobs at the bottom, but fewer in the middle. Labour blames the Government, the Government blames it on other people. Really what’s affecting it is technology replacing white collar jobs in the way that it replaced blue collar jobs back in the 70s, 80s and 90s.

Mr Rohan pointed to the example of the Nissan factory in Sunderland, which produces more than 500,000 cars a year but employs just 6,000 staff

‘If a tough place to be in the 80s was working in a manufacturing job, today if you’re working in a lower level job in a law firm or an accountants increasingly you’re seeing those kinds of jobs replaced by software.’

He said the Government urgently needed to do more to prepare middle class people for jobs in IT and technology – a key growth area.

‘Look at where most jobs have been created over the last five years: lots in residential care, in face-to-face retail – which are not jobs that can be replaced by technology. But the next biggest category is IT and technology.

‘That’s a real source of optimism here. The average IT job pays £20 an hour, well above the average wage. There’s a chronic shortage of trained computer scientists and software workers in the UK,’ he said.

‘That’s why the Government is having to create a tech talent visa, to bring these sorts of people in from abroad.

At the last Davos summit, Eric Schmidt said it's 'a race between computers and people'

‘The internet economy is already over ten per cent of UK GDP and it’s growing by 20 per cent per year. The question for us is how can we make sure British people benefit from this trend and don’t lose out from technology replacing old jobs.

‘That’s entirely about skills. It’s about getting computer coding into the curriculum, which we are the first G20 country to do.’

Mr Silva said there was ‘so much more that needs to be done’, calling for more tech and IT apprenticeships and adult training.

‘You can absolutely learn very quickly the skills you need to get a job in the technology industry at any age,’ he said. ‘This is either the biggest threat to jobs in the UK or it’s the biggest opportunity.’

Roger Bootle, managing director of Capital Economics, said: ‘In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, advances in technology mainly involved more powerful and productive machines that nevertheless needed to be operated by humans. Later came machines which effectively replaced human labour.

‘Simultaneously, though, new jobs appeared using human brain power. When computers came along, they started to substitute for various humdrum mental labours while leaving more complex tasks still in the field of the human. We are now on the brink of a change that will see machines take over these, too – hence a second "machine age".’

Eric Schmidt, head of Google, said at the last Davos summit of world leaders and economists: ‘It's a race between computers and people — and people need to win.’
