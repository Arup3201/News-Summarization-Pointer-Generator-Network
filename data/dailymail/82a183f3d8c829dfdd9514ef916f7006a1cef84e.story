Theresa May was accused of presiding over a ‘shambles’ as the head of the Government’s child abuse inquiry resigned six days after being appointed.

Baroness Butler-Sloss, 80, had faced pressure from MPs, lawyers and child protection experts over her brother’s involvement in an alleged cover-up of an Establishment paedophile ring.

The former judge said that, when accepting the inquiry role, she had not ‘sufficiently considered’ the  difficulties posed by allegations about her brother, the former attorney general Sir Michael Havers, might cause.

Baroness Butler-Sloss has resigned from the child abuse inquiry less than a week after her appointment

Theresa May's judgement was called into question today, after Lady Butler-Sloss resigned from the child abuse inquiry

Sir Michael is accused of trying to silence whistleblower Geoffrey Dickens before he outed a senior civil  servant and suspected MI6 officer as a paedophile in the Eighties.

Details of the attempted ‘cover-up’ was revealed in the Daily Mail on July 5 – a week before Lady Butler-Sloss’s appointment.

However, under hostile questioning from MPs, Home Secretary Mrs May said she had not personally been aware of them until the last few days.

The admission raised serious questions about the vetting procedure undertaken in Whitehall before such a crucial appointment. MPs said ministers must now find someone with ‘the integrity of Mother Teresa’ to take over the inquiry.

‘I was honoured to be invited by the Home Secretary to chair the wide-ranging inquiry about child sexual abuse and hoped I could make a useful contribution.

‘It has become apparent over the last few days, however, that there is a widespread perception, particularly among victim and survivor groups, that I am not the right person to chair the inquiry.

‘It has also become clear to me that I did not sufficiently consider whether my background and the fact my brother had been attorney general would cause difficulties.

‘This is a victim-orientated inquiry and those who wish to be heard must have confidence that the members of the panel will pay proper regard to their concerns and give appropriate advice to government.

‘Nor should attention be allowed to be diverted from the extremely important issues at stake, namely whether enough has been done to protect children from sexual abuse and hold to account those who commit these appalling crimes.

‘Having listened to the concerns of victim and survivor groups and the criticisms of MPs and the media, I have come to the conclusion that I should not chair this inquiry and have so informed the Home Secretary.

‘I should like to add that I have dedicated my life to public service, to the pursuit of justice and to protecting the rights of children and families and I wish the inquiry success in its important work.’

Yesterday Keith Vaz insisted that Lady Butler-Sloss’s replacement must not be an MP, peer, judge or member of the Church – because all these groups have been linked to the cover-up of child sex abuse.

Mr Vaz, chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee, warned it would be an almost ‘impossible task’ to find someone suitable. He told Mrs May: ‘The last couple of weeks have been somewhat shambolic.’

He added: ‘We all acknowledge that being Home Secretary is not like a walk in the park, but the last few weeks have been quite a surprise for a government department that we thought was extremely well run under your stewardship.

‘What has gone wrong? Why is it all unravelling?’

The episode marks the latest in a series of headaches for Mrs May.

Her special adviser resigned following an extraordinary row with Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, and she has since been criticised over the ongoing crisis at the Passport Office, as well as the admission that 114 files relating to allegations of child sex abuse were lost by her department.

Officials had hoped the appointment of Lady Butler-Sloss would reassure the public and MPs that the issue of an alleged Westminster paedophile ring was being taken seriously.

But, within hours of being put in charge, MPs and lawyers for victims of sexual abuse began to question whether – as an ex-judge and sister of Sir Michael – she had a conflict of interest.

This was followed by what Mrs May called ‘suggestion and innuendo’ about Lady Butler-Sloss’s role in past inquiries into paedophilia.

Claims were also made about the late Sir Michael attending parties in the 1980s at which young boys were abused.

It is believed that, over the weekend, Lady Butler-Sloss began to question whether she should resign, and then told ministers she intended to quit.

Mrs May told MPs: ‘I reject entirely the suggestion that she wasn’t the right person to do this job, but she has taken the decision [to quit] herself. I am disappointed.’

Mr Vaz said that, in standing down, Lady Butler-Sloss had shown better judgment than the Government had in giving her the role in the first place.

He accused ministers of failing to carry out proper ‘due diligence’, telling Channel 4 News: ‘Poor old Elizabeth Butler-Sloss. She’s the victim in all this.’

Allegations: Sir Michael Havers, Baroness Butler-Sloss's brother, is accused of tryign to silence a whistle blower who was attempting to uncover a senior MI6 officer as a paedophile in the 1980s

Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, who organised a letter signed by 140 MPs calling for the inquiry, said that once it decided to hold one, the Home Office rushed Lady Butler-Sloss’s appointment ‘without doing its homework’. 

The peer’s brother, Sir Michael was accused of the ‘cover-up of the century’ by MP Geoffrey Dickens over his refusal to prosecute Foreign Office diplomat Sir Peter Hayman, a member of the infamous Paedophile Information Exchange.

The then attorney general is said to have rowed outside the Commons chamber with Mr Dickens as he tried in vain to stop him using parliamentary privilege to name Sir Peter as a paedophile.

Deputy Labour Leader Harriet Harman has conceded that the paedophile ring was 'trying to infiltrate every part of the system' and 'probably' succeeded

Harriet Harman yesterday conceded that the notorious Paedophile Information Exchange probably infiltrated the Home Office in the 1970s.

PIE was an affiliated member of the National Council for Civil Liberties (NCCL) while she was NCCL’s legal officer from 1978 to 1982.

Labour’s deputy leader said in a radio phone-in last night that the group had ‘probably’ also found its way into the Home Office.

She told LBC Radio: ‘I don’t know categorically but they were trying to infiltrate every part of the system’.

Miss Harman has already said that the child abuse inquiry, called by the Government last week, would have to investigate links between PIE and the civil liberties group she used to work for – now called Liberty.

Last night she added that Baroness Butler-Sloss was right to step down as head of the inquiry, due to her brother having served as attorney general during the period being investigated. This is despite Miss Harman saying last week that the Baroness was ‘exactly the right person to lead the inquiry’.

Miss Harman said that while she is ‘clearly a good and well respected person’, she had failed to gain the confidence of victims.

‘Obviously they should have thought this through a bit more’, she said.

‘People feel there have been so many cover-ups and so much not listening to the victims ... if people think there is still going to be a cover-up, there is going to be defensiveness on behalf of the establishment, then this inquiry won’t achieve what [it] really needs to achieve.’

Miss Harman added last night that child sex abuse was ‘not a party political issue’.

She also reiterated that she had ‘never had anything to do’ with PIE while at the NCCL.
