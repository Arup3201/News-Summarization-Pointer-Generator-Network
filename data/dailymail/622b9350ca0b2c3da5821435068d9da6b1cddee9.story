Police in Kenya have seized two tonnes of ivory worth more than £700,000 in the biggest haul the country has ever seen.

Kenya's Revenue Authority said customs 
officers had impounded 638 pieces of elephant tusk in a shipping container purporting to be carrying 'decoration stones'.

The seizure comes over a week after 11 elephants were killed in a Kenyan park and their tusks chopped off.

'This is a big catch, the biggest ever single seizure of ivory at the port of Mombasa,' said Kiberenge Seroney, the port's police officer in charge of criminal investigations.

'We fail to understand where one gathers the courage to park such enormous quantities of ivory, hoping that they can slip through our security systems.'

Poaching is a growing problem for sub-Saharan African countries reliant on rich wildlife in their game reserves to draw foreign tourists.

Black market: The latest haul is thought to have arrived in Kenya from Rwanda and Tanzania

Heavily-armed criminals kill elephants and rhinos for their tusks, which are used for ornaments and in some folk medicines. Most of the elephant tusks smuggled from Africa ends up in Asian countries, according to police

In 2011, almost 25 tons of contraband 
ivory was collected from around the world - the product of an estimated 
2,500 slaughtered elephants – making it the worst year for poaching 
since ivory harvesting was banned in 1989.

Figures for 2012 are yet unknown, but most black-market ivory harvested in Kenya and Tanzania is bound for Asia, with China, Japan and Thailand among the top destinations.

It is used for billiard balls, piano keys, carved art and jewelry.

The number of elephants killed by poacher has doubled in the last decade.

Today, eight out of every ten elephant deaths is the result of poaching, compared with four out of ten deaths six years ago, the prosecutor's office said.

On January 5, poachers killed a family
 of 11 elephants in the biggest single mass shooting of the animals on 
record in Kenya, wildlife officials said.

 Gitau, an assistant commissioner with the Kenya Revenue Authority, said
 paperwork accompanying a container at the port of Mombasa declared it 
contained decorative stones.

'But
 when we opened it we found elephant tusks,' said Gitau as he displayed 
the ivory. 'The ivory was originating from Rwanda and Tanzania and was 
to be exported to Indonesia.'

Elephant poaching deaths are on the 
rise across Africa because of increased demand from Asia - and 
particularly from China - for ivory trinkets.

Poor African villagers can
 earn vast sums for killing an elephant and taking its tusks.

It
 is becoming of particular concern to wildlife campaigners and 
authorities in Kenya where, just over a week ago, poachers killed a 
family of 11 elephants in the biggest mass shooting of the animals on 
record.

A gang of about
 ten attackers hacked off the elephants' tusks in Tsavo East National 
Park, on Saturday, in the latest sign of a resurgence of demand for 
ivory jewellery and ornaments, mainly coming from Asia.

Growing issue: The seizure comes over a week after 11 elephants were killed in a Kenyan park and their tusks chopped off. Here, Ivory tusks are displayed after being confiscated by Hong Kong Customs on January 4

Rising problem: Elephant poaching in Kenya declined sharply after 1989 when the government banned trade in ivory. But there has been a rise in the illegal practice in recent years

Elephant poaching in Kenya declined sharply after 1989 when the government banned trade in ivory.

But there has been a rise in the illegal practice in recent years.

In May, 359 tusks weighing 1.6 tonnes impounded in Sri Lanka were found to have come from Kenya's Mombasa port.

Police found 214 tusks worth $1.32 million hidden in a coffin and fertiliser bags in neighbouring Tanzania in October.

The force said smugglers had planned to transport the ivory to Kenya for onward shipment to Asia.
