Barcelona took a massive step towards the La Liga title  with a 2-1 victory over Real Madrid in the Clasico, and their players took to social media to celebrate.

Brazilian striker Neymar was quick to upload photos to Instagram after his team's narrow victory on Sunday night at the Nou Camp.

Neymar shared an image of himself with Lionel Messi and four other Brazilians Rafinha, Douglas, Dani Alves and Adriano in the dressing room after the match.

But that was after the striker had already uploaded a picture of his deadly striker partners Messi and Luis Suarez, who was giving the thumbs up.

Suarez scored what proved to be the winner in the 56th minute in his first Clasico at the Nou Camp after latching onto Alves' pass.

It was a win that took Barcelona four points clear of their rivals with 10 games remaining, and should they go on to win La Liga we could be seeing more social media celebrations.
