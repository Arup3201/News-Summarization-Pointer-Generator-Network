Tech-savy customers have adapted drone technology which is being used to film everything from houses to extreme sports from the air.

The dramatic rise in sales of personal drones has been boosted by the new 'dronie' craze while the personal aircraft are also becoming more affordable.

Latest figures from electronics specialist Maplin reveal sales of drones have shot up by 200 per cent in the last eight weeks with the retailer predicting drones to be the 'must-have' gift this Christmas.

Maplin spokesperson Breffni Walsh, said: 'People are clearly opting to take the selfie to new levels and ‘dronie’ demand has soared.

'Drones will be the "must have" gift this Christmas and we’ve already seen a huge spike in the number of customers coming into store to purchase them for their loved ones.'

The term ‘dronie’ is defined by the urban dictionary as 'a photo taken of one’s own self using a remote-controlled pilotless aircraft.'

One of Maplin’s most popular models is the new DJI Phantom FC40 Quadcopter Drone costing £369.99. 

Small enough to fit in a back-pack, it comes with an attachable HD camera to allow photographs and video to be shot using the specially built app. Footage can be swiftly uploaded onto a computer or directly to YouTube and other video sharing sites.

Skiers and snowboarders in New Zealand have already used the technique to capture themselves going down the slopes.

They attach GoPro cameras to the aircraft and hover the devices above the snow.
