As the sun sets over yet another hot day for many Brits, it is a wise move not to pack the barbecue away just yet.

After enjoying the warmest and sunniest summer since 2006, we are now in store for a  sizzling start to September.

Forecasters
expect temperatures to soar as high as 29C (84F) in some parts of the 
country this week, raising hopes of an Indian summer.

Another perfect day: The sun sets over Oxfordshire as a new week of sizzling temperatures is upon us

Although 
cooler and wetter weather is expected at the weekend, forecasters are 
predicting a warmer than normal September throughout.

Lindsay 
Mears, Met Office forecaster, said: ‘It will be a nice start to the 
month, particularly in the South East where Thursday is expected to be a
very hot day.

‘The sunny weather looks certain to continue until 
the weekend when it will become a bit more unsettled but we can expect 
slightly above average temperatures for September.

‘However, officially to have an Indian summer, we will need to have warm temperatures in October and November.’

The pros: Further upstream some serious rowers sped past as forecasters predicted even warmer temperatures each day until Thursday

In some parts of the south of England, forecasters have said temperatures could reach 29 or 29C on Thursday

The
late burst of summer sunshine will see highs of 26C (79F) today (Tues) 
and 28C tomorrow (Wed) in the South East, which will peak with a high of
29C on Thursday.

Helen Rossington, a forecaster for MeteoGroup, 
said: ‘While it is going to be nice in the south, it’s not looking great
for the north, west Wales and Northern Ireland, where conditions are 
expected to be cooler and cloudier and temperatures will only get up to 
19C.’

‘Things will go a bit downhill towards the end of the week, with 
unsettled conditions and thunder and rain moving up from the south.’

The UK has enjoyed its warmest, driest and sunniest summer since 2006, according to Met Office figures.

Mean
temperatures hit 15.2C (59F) which is 0.8C above the average, according
to the estimates covering June 1 through to August 28.

MeteoGroup forecaster Helen Rossington said '30C can't be ruled out' for parts of the country this week

Meanwhile, further north, the Met Office said temperatures would push towards 25C in the North and 20C forecast in Scotland

Serene: University student Winnie Shek, 27, took a stroll along the beach in Aberdeen with forecasters predicting temperatures to come close to 26 degrees - a record for Aberdeen in September

The 
summer’s highest temperature was not during the July heatwave but on 
August 1 when the mercury reached 34.1C (93F) at Heathrow.

In 
terms of rainfall, the estimate suggests about 189 mm (7.45in) of rain -
which is 78% of the UK average, making this the driest summer since 
2006 and ranking about 16th driest in the records dating back to 1910.

For south-east England and East Anglia this will be the driest summer since 1995.

The
Met office said it was too early to predict whether or not we could 
expect an Indian Summer which is officially defined as a warm, calm 
spell of weather occurring after the first frost in autumn, especially 
in October and November The warmest recorded temperatures in the UK in 
October and November are 29.9 c on 1 October 2011, in Kent, and 21.1c on
2 November 1938, in Essex and Suffolk.
