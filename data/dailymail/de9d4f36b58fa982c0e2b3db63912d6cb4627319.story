Killer: James Gethen, now 16, was jailed for manslaughter today after admitting killing his mother on the grounds of diminished responsibility

A 15-year-old boy clubbed his mother to death with a baseball bat before calmly walking out of the house and telling a neighbour what he had done, a court heard today.

James Gethen said he could 'see her brains' after carrying out the attack.

He attacked Ann Gethen, 39, in a fit of rage hours after she announced her engagement on Facebook.

The schoolboy had been traumatised by the death of his father eight months earlier and had even tried to jump into his grave, a court heard today.

He had a history of violence and killed his mother in a brutal, unprovoked and sustained late-night attack at the family home.

His sister Paula, 16, was woken by screams from the living room and when she saw what had happened Gethen told her: ‘I’m not bothered. I hope she’s dead.’

Today Gethen was given an indeterminate sentence for public protection at Leeds Crown Court and must serve at least five years before he can be considered for release.

He pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.

Mr Justice Openshaw said a psychiatrist concluded the teenager was ‘highly dangerous.’

He called the case ‘dreadful’ and said any thought the defendant’s danger would go away was merely ‘a hope.’

The attack took place at 3am on 15 August last year at the family home in Barnsley, South Yorkshire.

Murdered: Ann Gethen, 39, was killed by her son in Barnsley. He then calmly walked outside and told his neighbour what he had done

Michael Smith, prosecuting, said the teenager struck his mother over the head several times with the bat and killed her almost instantaneously.

There were sobs from the public gallery when the court heard how Gethen, now 16, told a neighbour: ‘I hit my mum round the head with a baseball bat and could see her brains and everything.’

Adrian Waterman, QC, defending, said Gethen suffered a number of psychiatric problems – believed to stem from a bout of meningitis he suffered as a premature baby.

He said Gethen had suffered an abnormal bereavement reaction when his father Eric died from cancer in December 2009 and he ‘tried to enter the grave’ when he was buried.

Gethen also expressed his wish to be buried alongside him, the court heard.

The teenager shared a bed with his sister and lived a ‘complex’ family life in a house  where the attic bedroom was fire-damaged and the windows and front door were boarded up.

He had previously displayed ‘sexually abusive behaviour’ towards girls, was expelled from school because of bullying and fighting with other pupils and his school records show ‘episodes of disruptive behaviour and violence on an almost daily basis.’

In one incident he tried to strangle a school friend with a shoelace.

His father ‘knew how to sort him out’ and following his death the boy ended up in court for damaging a relative’s home and throwing a brick through a 76-year-old man’s window.

When assessed by psychiatrists, the teenager confessed to ‘homicidal ideas’ and ‘unusual images of himself committing homicide.’

Outside court Detective Superintendent James Abdy of South Yorkshire Police said: ‘This was a tragic event and our thoughts are with the family.

‘They have not only had to endure the loss of a loved one but also come to terms with the fact that Ann’s life was cut short at the hands of her own son James.’
