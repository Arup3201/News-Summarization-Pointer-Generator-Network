Joseph Wilcox, 31, was shot dead by white supremacist couple Jerad and Amanda Miller on Sunday after he confronted them in a Las Vegas mall

The civilian shot dead by a white supremacist couple on Sunday after he confronted them in a Las Vegas mall has been hailed a hero for his fearless bravery in attempting to protect others.

Joseph Wilcox, 31, was shopping in Wal-Mart when Jerad Miller and his wife Amanda Miller entered.

The couple had just killed two police officers and in the store, Jerad Miller fired one round and told everyone to get out.

Wilcox, who was legally carrying a concealed weapon, told his friends he was going to confront the gunman - not realizing that he had an accomplice.

Wilcox went from the checkout area to Jerad Miller and pulled his concealed firearm. But before he could fire, Amanda Miller shot him in the ribs and Wilcox collapsed.

‘Joseph died attempting to protect others. His death is completely senseless,’ said Sheriff Doug Gillespie.

'He had no idea the wife was walking behind him,' a police official told the Las Vegas Review Journal.

'This guy (Wilcox) was not some idiot with a gun. To me, he was a hero. He was trying to stop an active shooter.'

At the time of his death, Wilcox was unemployed. Ironically, he had applied to the Metropolitan Police Department a few years earlier, but hadn’t been accepted.

Police have confirmed that Wilcox was not able to get off a shot before he died.

Jeremy Tanner, a friend, was with Wilcox at the Walmart before the shooting started.

‘Joseph
 had the option to go left and exit the store to safety, but he instead 
went into the store and chased after the gunman,’ he told CNN.

‘I wanted
 to tell him: “Don't do this. Come with me.” But I also felt that he's 
possibly going to be saving some lives.’

Wilcox's sister, CJ Foster, said her brother was pro-gun and believed that people kill people, rather than guns.

‘He did a very brave thing and I'm very proud of him. I'm proud to call him my brother,’ she said.

His uncle, John Wilson, told the Las Vegas Review Journal that, 'He wasn’t political. But he definitely believed in the right to bear arms and the right to defend yourself and others.'

On Sunday, the two Las Vegas police officers were having lunch at a pizza buffet in an aging strip mall about five miles northeast of the Las Vegas Strip when the Millers fatally shot them.

The attack at a CiCi's Pizza killed officers Alyn Beck, 41, and Igor Soldo, 31, both of whom were husbands and fathers.

Jerad Miller fatally shot Soldo in the back of his head. As his partner tried to react, Miller shot him once in the throat. Amanda Miller then pulled her own gun and both shot Beck several times.

Police believe that while the Millers wanted to target police, the choice of Soldo and Beck was random.

Pulling the mortally wounded officers from the booth, they took their guns and ammunition and put a yellow Gadsden flag featuring the phrase "Don't tread on me" and a swastika on Beck's body.

The flag, with its roots in the American Revolution, is a symbol for anti-government groups.

Police said they believe the swastika 
was intended to paint police as Nazis, not necessarily as an expression 
of the Millers' own white-supremacist views.

The couple also told restaurant patrons that their act was 'the beginning of the revolution,' the same message as a note they left at the restaurant.

The couple went next to a Wal-Mart about a block away, where Jerad Miller entered, fired one round and 'told the people to get out and this was a revolution and that the police were on the way.'

In the frenzy, shopper Joseph Wilcox decided to confront Jerad Miller - not realizing that Amanda Miller was his accomplice. But before he could fire, she had shot him in the ribs.

By now, police had arrived, and two five-officer teams entered the massive store. Near the back, one team confronted the Millers, and exchanged fire.

At one point, Jerad Miller tried to 
blast a rear emergency exit door open with a shotgun, but police had 
blocked it with a car and he could not escape.

By looking at the store's surveillance camera feeds, an officer saw that Jerad Miller had built a makeshift barricade around his wife.

As police closed in, Amanda Miller shot her husband several times with a handgun, killing him. She then shot herself in the head. When officers arrived, she was still breathing, and was taken to the hospital. She later died.

Police found hundreds more rounds of unspent ammunition in the Millers' bags.
