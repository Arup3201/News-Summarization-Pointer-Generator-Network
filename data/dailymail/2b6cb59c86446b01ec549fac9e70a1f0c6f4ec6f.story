DaMarcus Beasley, the first American to play in four World Cups, says he is retiring from the U.S. national team after 14 years.

The 32-year-old scored 17 goals in 121 international appearances and played in every minute of the Americans' four games at this year's World Cup, where the U.S. lost to Belgium in the second round. 

After playing in midfield at three World Cups, Beasley was shifted to left back for this year's tournament.

Beasley made his national team debut in 2001 and appeared his finale last month in an exhibition against Colombia in London. 

After playing abroad for PSV Eindhoven, Manchester City, Rangers, Hannover and Puebla, Beasley signed with Houston in July. He had started his professional career in Major League Soccer with the Chicago Fire from 2000-04.
