A teenager who beat up an ambulanceman as he tried to treat a barely conscious woman at a house party has been jailed.

Reece Richmond, 19, assaulted Gary Stacey with his older brother, Samuel, last April after the paramedic was called to a party the boys were at

Reece Richmond, 19, assaulted Gary Stacey when he was asked to leave the rowdy party in Nelson, Lancashire, last April.

Mr Stacey, 59, suffered a black eye, gashed eyelid and a puncture wound on the inside of his cheek when Richmond and his older brother attacked him, a court heard today.

Mr Stacey went to the house on Hollins Road, Nelson, with his colleague, Sarah Walsh, after a 999 call alerted emergency services to the party.

Burnley Crown Court heard today how the drunk mother was vomiting into a bucket while her toddler lay on a sofa, surrounded by rowdy drinkers between the ages of 18 and 24.

The woman, a tenant at the house, was only partially conscious when Mr Stacey and Ms Walsh arrived.

In the interest of her two children's safety, the paramedics asked people who were at the party to go home. 

Prosecutor Richard Bennett said it was at this moment Reece Richmond launched the attack, after Mr Stacey threatened to call police. 

Richmond reportedly warned: 'Why have you said that? He’s going to kick off', before standing up and striking the ambulanceman in the face. 

His older brother, Samuel Richmond, 20, then 
stood up and joined in the attack which took Mr Stacey's ambulance off 
the road for four hours.

Ms Walsh intervened and was able to get the victim to their vehicle before phoning police.

Both brothers had fled the scene by the time officers arrived, but were later arrested.

When questioned, Richmond accepted the paramedic was only trying to carry out his job, admitting his actions were uncalled for. The teenager said he wanted to apologise to the victim.

His brother claimed he punched Mr Stacey after he had started to push him and he didn’t like it.

Mr Bennett said: 'The ambulance was out of commission for four hours, presenting a risk to the general public.'

The court heard how Mr Stacey was anxious, had trouble sleeping and was hesitant in attending certain jobs for some time after the incident, before both brothers admitted assault causing actual bodily harm.

Richmond and his older brother, Samuel, appeared at Burnley Crown Court today where they were sentenced to 30 weeks in jail and 30 weeks in detention, suspended for one year, with 150 hours of unpaid work, respectively

Richmond, who has previous 
convictions for affray and battery, was sentenced to 30 weeks in jail 
while older brother, Samuel, received 30 weeks in detention, suspended 
for a year, and was ordered to complete 150 hours of unpaid work.

Julian
Goode, defending the latter, said his client had been shocked by his own
behaviour and pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. 

Martin
Hackett, for Reece Richmond, told the court his client accepted that 
courts had a duty to protect public servants doing their jobs and knew 
he would be going to jail.

Mr
Hackett said: 'He accepts that he acted in a way which is wholly 
contrary to that in which anybody should behave in a civilised society.'

The
sentencing judge, Recorder Andrew Thomas, QC, said: 'Mr Stacey’s eye 
injury was significant and it was a very serious offence. He had simply 
been doing his job, putting himself in harm’s way.

'People
in that position, providing a service to the public, members of the 
medical profession, are entitled to expect the courts to protect them 
from offences of violence.'

After
the case, PC Martin Vernon of Lancashire Police said: 'This was an 
appalling attack on a man who only went to do his job and help someone 
in need. He was set upon by the Reece and Samuel Richmond for no reason.'

The 19-year-old admitted his actions were out of order and expressed a desire to apologise to Mr Stacey who suffered a black eye and gashed upper eyelid

'Today’s sentence shows that we will not tolerate attacks or abuse against any member of the emergency services in the line of their duty. You will be brought before the courts and punished.'

North West Ambulance Service Acting Director of Operations, Derek Cartwright, added: 'The violent and physical attack on our member of staff was absolutely unacceptable, and I fully welcome the custodial sentence given. 

'The assaulted paramedic himself needed hospital treatment and, as a consequence, we had to allocate another emergency ambulance to treat the patient at the scene, when this resource could have been allocated to another emergency call.

'When paramedics attend the scene of any incident, they are there to provide professional medical attention to the patient, and should never be put in a position where they are subjected to any violence or aggression. 

'We hope this sentence sends out a very clear message to anyone who assaults our crews - either verbally or physically - that they not only face the possibility of prosecution, but a prison sentence as well.'
