When Maria Brewer bought a battery powered koala bear for her daughter Willow she hoped it would make a perfect present for her first birthday.

But the mother-of-two was shocked when her older three-year-old child noticed that as well as making 'koala gurgling noises' it also appeared to say 'motherf*****.'

The cuddly grey toy, which costs £34.99 is meant to move its arms, make koala gurgling noises and move its ears.

But Mrs Brewer, of Widley in Hampshire, has been forced to explain what the swearword means to her three-year-old Meghan after she started repeating what she had heard from the toy.

Maria Brewer bought a koala toy for her daughter Willow's first birthday, but the care home manager from Fareham, was shocked when her three-year-old daughter told her it appeared to say 'motherf******'

The care home manager said: 'I don't want my kids to be picking up on words like that.

'I don't know what a koala bear sounds like but I don't think a koala bear would sound like that. It's inappropriate.

Mrs Brewer bought the teddy bear from toy store Smyths in Fareham. After she discovered it said the offending words she returned it to the shop.

She added  'My daughter Meghan has got the monkey version and Willow always wants to play with it, so we got the koala for her.

The Emotion Pet Koala Bear  appears to say 'motherf*****' when it should make gurgling koala sounds

'But it swears. We just left it and then it said it again. I was shocked because it was very clear. I looked online to see if anyone else had heard it.

'On the advert, it certainly did not swear - it's a cute cuddly koala bear.'

Mrs Brewer said she is concerned other children might have similar toys and could end up getting told off for repeating the swearword. 

Mrs Brewer said she was shocked the koala appeared to swear and has returned it the the  store

Graham Moriarty, manager at Smyths, said: 'The koala does not actually speak, it does not say anything.

'It's a fine line of where I can go with this as the suppliers and buyers feel there's no issues because there's no other complaints.

'We are not the sort of company that is going to sell inappropriate products.'

Michele Bates from Flair which makes the koala, said: 'This toy has been on sale for many months across Europe and it is the first complaint of its kind.

'We are therefore making urgent tests of a batch of the toys to investigate.

'This will be done without delay and as soon as we have a result we promise to come back to you.'

The Emotion Pet Koala Bear is available from a number of toy shops in store and online. On the Argos website a description of the toy says: 'Lipto the Koala wakes up, moves his ears and makes cute koala sounds. 

'Put something near his mouth and hear him crunch and chew. He can hug your arm with his velcro hands. Give him a hug to hear his heart beat.

'Real movements and sound.'
