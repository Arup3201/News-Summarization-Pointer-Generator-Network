Australia's peak consumer body says Foxtel has only itself to blame for record piracy figures after hit HBO series Game of Thrones was downloaded illegally nearly 2 million times after Monday night's finale.

Choice spokesperson Erin Turner said Foxtel's exclusive rights deal with HBO to air Game of Thrones two hours after the U.S. on Showcase had effectively forced consumers unwilling to pay for the cable company's monthly packages to seek alternative means of accessing premium content.

Game of Thrones' season four finale aired on Monday night, prompting 1.5 million hits on the web piracy hub TorrentFreak in just the first 12 hours after the show went to air in Australia on Monday.

'There needs to be a focus on accessibility and affordability,' Ms Turner told Daily Mail Australia, adding that Choice opposes costly measures proposed by the Federal Government to tackle internet piracy.

'Compared to last year, we could get Game of Thrones on Quickflix and iTunes - now the only option is to have access to Foxtel. We don't want legislation that props up Foxtel's model.'

'People know there should be more options. I think they (Foxtel) need to start thinking about what people want and at a price that's fair.'

'There's little competition in Australia and Foxtel shouldn't be the only place where people can go to get certain content.'

Foxtel confirmed more than 2.5 million subscribe to its services, with about 525,000 watching each episode of the recent  Game of Thrones season.

A spokesman said the company considered illegal downloading a major issue. 'Piracy is a serious problem, which undermines the viability of all creative businesses,' he said.

'It’s not just an issue for businesses, it affects the livelihoods of actors, writers, directors, set designers, and everyone else involved in the production of these programs.'

The spokesman said the company had introduced 'flexible' ways for viewers to access its programs legally, including as a full set-top box subscriber or through monthly no-lock in contracts.

The company has also made a 'massive investment' by making content available on tablets, mobile phones and other devices, the spokesman said and specifically pointed out the Game of Thrones subscription, which offers showcase and other channels from $35 per month.

'The bundled model is the one used around the world, including by HBO in the USA, without it many channels and programs would become economically unviable. Incidentally, it's the same model used by publishers around the world who put content behind a pay wall,' the spokesman said.

Ms Turner suggested one solution to the issue could be Australian access to Netflix, which would allow people to stream media on various devices.

'That's where we have a different position - we don't support illegal downloading. But we encourage people to go around, geo-block and pay for content in another contry at a price that is fair,' she said. 'This money goes to the content producer.

'We're telling the government not to put in polices that lock us into products - consumers need choice that's accessible and affordable.'

But she added that the reasons behind piracy also need to be looked at and that policies currently being considered by the government to crack down on illegal downloading will not stop the issue.

Foxtel signed a deal giving it exclusive rights to air the smash series in Australia from this year, shortly after it is screened in the US

'If you want to stop people illegally downloading, you need to get to the root of the problem,' she said. 'You need to look at access and affordability of content in Australia.'

Ms Turner said another major factor propagating the problem was the 'Australia tax' otherwise known as international price discrimination.

'We pay up to 50 per cent more for movies, programs and songs compared to the rest of the world - this needs to be addressed,' she said.

Being able to access media on different devices including tablets was also something consumers want, but are not often offered, she said.

Choice spokesperson Tom Godfrey said while the organisation was critical and does not support illegal downloading, it was pro competition.

'We want to see better competition to access to digital content,' he said. 'We want consumers to pay but to have a choice in what they pay for.'

'We support people who are seeking to legally access and pay for content from around the world.'

Choice has also blamed the 'Australia tax' for forcing people to illegally download

The Federal Government is looking at ways to stop people breaching copyright through illegal downloading, by taking action such warning and then fining repeat infringers, reported Zednet.

The Foxtel spokesman said it was the responsibility of 'everyone' to tackle the problem of illegal downloading.

'Content owners should make content available quickly and conveniently, Government should put in place a regulatory system that encourages legitimate use and discourages illegitimate use of content,' he said.

'Internet service providers should assist by mitigating, to the extent they can, use of their networks for unauthorised purposes.'

He said all parties involved had an obligation to make sure consumers are educated about the implications of unauthorised use of content and how to access to legitimate sources of content.

Choice is campaigning to run a full page ad in the national media telling the government not to force costly policies onto consumers and internet service providers that won't even address the root causes of internet piracy.

'The federal government is considering proposals to stop internet piracy: an internet filter or a three-strikes style warning system,' the Choice website states.

'These proposals won't stop piracy but they will make the internet more expensive and slower for everyone, not just people illegally downloading content.

'We support people who are seeking to legally access and pay for content from around the world,' Mr Godfrey said.

The organisation is also calling on the government to axe the 'Australia tax' to give consumers the benefits of overseas competition.

A spokesman for the Attorney-General George Brandis confirmed the government is actively considering ways to stop online piracy. 'No decision has been made,' he said.

During Senate Estimates on May 28 Senator Brandis said the government stated its view on the need for copyright reform during the 2013 Federal Election campaign.

'Unlike the UK, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, France and many other comparable countries, Australia lacks effective protection against online piracy,' he said.

'Australia, I am sorry to say, is the worst offender of any country in the world when it comes to piracy, and I am very concerned that the legitimate rights and interests of rights holders and content creators are being compromised by that activity.'

He highlighted the concern of singers, filmmakers and other people affected by their work being stolen through piracy. 'So we want to do something about that,' he said.
