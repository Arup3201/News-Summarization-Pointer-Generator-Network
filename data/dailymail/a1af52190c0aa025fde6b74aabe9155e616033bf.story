The first video of the $300million Falcon HTV-2 hypersonic spacecraft has been released following its ill-fated second test flight.

The 13,000mph unmanned aircraft of the future took off for a crucial test flight from a Californian rocket pad earlier this month.

It travelled to the edge of space and was due to glide back down to Earth at roughly four miles per second but all contact was lost and the craft was thought to have crashed.

Falcon HTV-2: The aircraft can travel at 20 times the speed of sound - or 13,000mph. It is part of research effort by Darpa to one day make long-duration hypersonic flight a reality

Now video footage of its penultimate 
moments has been released by the Defense Advanced Research Projects 
Agency (Darpa) and while it doesn't show the craft's 'controlled descent' 
into the Pacific Ocean, it does give some ideas of its incredible speed.

The soundless footage shows the Falcon streaking across the sky at Mach 20 on August 11.

The video was made by a crew member 
aboard the Pacific Tracker, the first monitoring vessel able to visually
 track the Falcon's initial entry into the atmosphere.

Darpa director Regina Dugan says the video, 'gives us a visceral feel for what it means to fly at Mach 20.'

Epic: The mission might lead to new records, super weapons and eventually global travel at colossal speeds. The aircraft is unmanned, rocket-launched and manoeuvrable

Name: Falcon HTV-2

Mission: To provide the U.S. Military with its first in a new generation of sub-orbital weaons.

Top speed: 13,000mph or Mach 22. A MiG-25 can typically reach Mach 2.3, or 1,520mph

Length: 12ft long

Weight: 900kg

Materials: Made of experimental material that can withstand up to 3,500f (2000C) it will experience upon re-entry.

Cost: $308million (£189million), so far

Payload: Potentially anything up to 12,000lbs, including a nuclear bomb.

Range: Anywhere in the world in less than 60 minutes

As a companion piece to the video, 
Darpa also released a simulated speed comparison between the Falcon, a 
C-5 and an F-18 fighter jet, which show the Falcon making mincemeat of 
its competitors among the clouds. 

The Falcon is currently being 
developed by Darpa and the Pentagon as part of research into a new 
generation of weapons with the potential to strike rogue states anywhere
 on Earth in under 60 minutes.

However, it is hoped the craft could 
one day make long-haul hypersonic flight a reality as at up to 20 times 
the speed of sound it would slash the flying time from London to Sydney 
to just an hour.

The Falcon reaches such a high speed 
partly because of its own weight descending through Earth's atmosphere, 
but also because of the experimental engines on board which are designed
 to run at extreme velocities.

The test-flight featured in the Darpa 
video was the team's second attempt at making science fiction a reality.
 The first test had to be aborted last year after its onboard systems 
detected a fault.

The second attempted flight lifted off
 from Vandenberg Air Force Base on board an Air Force Minotaur IV 
rocket, which took the HTV-2 to the edge of the atmosphere.

After it separated from the rocket, it was supposed to glide over the Pacific at up to 20 times the speed of sound.

The take-off went well but contact was lost with the craft at the glide phase.
