A north Texas woman is outraged with her five-year-old son's elementary school after they put him on a bus when he was supposed to remain at school for a daycare program.

The bus ended up dropping Ashley Holder's son, Gabriel Muntu, nearly a mile from their apartment, and he walked home alone on Wednesday. 

Gabriel had reportedly told a substitute teacher at North Elementary School in Fort Worth that he was not supposed to ride the bus, but he was put on to the vehicle anyway. 

Five-year-old Gabriel Muntu was put on a bus instead of staying at the building for an after-school daycare program on Wednesday

When he was dropped off, he walked nearly a mile alone to get to his family's north Texas apartment

Gabriel's mother, Ashley Holder, said that she 'felt sick' because 'anything could have happened' to her son, who was, unknowingly to her, walking around around Fort Worth alone

When Gabriel showed his mom where he had been dropped off, she realized it was nearly a mile away from their home. 

Once he was dropped of, he crossed a busy four-lane road as he walked home. Holder told NBC 5 that her son said he crossed the street more than once. 

Holder was especially concerned because Gabriel is supposed to have an upcoming surgery on his feet.

Holder, pictured here with her partner and two children, said she spoke up because she doesn't want something like this to happen to any other children

'I felt sick and I cried because that's my baby, you know. He could have been hit by a car. He could have been kidnapped. Anything could have happened,' Holder told NBC 5.

'He dodged cars to get home and I asked him, I was like, "Were there cars? Did you see them?" and he was like, "Oh they stopped for me"', Holder added. 'If they wouldn't have stopped, that could have been my son's life and that's the only reason why I'm saying something.'

White Settlement Independent School District officials said that there was a lapse in procedure on Wednesday. 

The school apologized to Gabriel's family and will review procedures to ensure another student doesn't go through what Gabriel did.
