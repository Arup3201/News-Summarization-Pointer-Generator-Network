TV pundit Chris Kamara, 56, today chased down and caught a street robber in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil

The former footballer posted pictures to his 1.2million followers of the topless criminal being captured by police after the dramatic chase

One image shows the criminal, who allegedly stole a necklace, being wrestled to the floor and arrested by two police officers, while Kamara stands nearby.

The former Bradford, Luton and Swindon 
star, who is in Brazil for the World Cup, then tweeted that he had 'not 
lost' his pace - but that he was 'done in' after the heroic chase.

On the caption of the photo, the footballer, who tweets as @Chris_Kammy, wrote: ‘Not lost me pace!!! I just caught 
this street robber. Done in now though’.

The pundit, who is known for his jovial commentary style, tweeted a second photo of himself standing in front of his 'prize catch', who is facing a fence with his hands cuffed behind his back. 

The ex-footballer, who has 1.2m 
followers on the site, then joked that his good deed had back fired - 
after realising he would have to give a statement to police.

He uploaded two more photos - one of the criminal and one of him chatting with a local policeman.

He tweeted an image of the robber being wrestled to the ground and handcuffed saying 'Not lost me pace!!!!'

Kamara kept his followers updated as the scene moved from the streets to the police station, where he was asked to give a statement

He joked: ‘Giving my statement now: “well I ran after him & caught him”’, before tweeting 'Have to go to the station to write it down!!!! I am on me holidays'.

Kamara later revealed officials had told him off for the chase because the robber could have been armed.

The pundit, known for his humorous commentating style, then posted a photo of himself talking to local police about the incident

The pundit said the victim had received his necklace back. He commented 'alls well that ends well'

He said: 'Police & British 
Consulate in Brazil have politely told me off, a lot of these guys are 
armed! So don't chase again.'

He
 later updated followers, telling them he was in the 'cop shop' giving a
 statement - before saying that 'Mike' had got his necklace back.

He said: 'Police got Mikes necklace of the robber & so we declined to press charges. So all is well that end well'.
