Murderer Jeremy Bamber would torment his magistrate father by covering himself in make-up for trips to the local shops, a new documentary will reveal tomorrow.

Bamber, now 52, enjoyed doing 'outrageous' things to provoke his adoptive parents, Nevill and June, both 61, before he went on to shoot them dead at their Essex farmhouse alongside his adopted sister Sheila and her six-year-old twins.

Farm secretary Barbara Wilson, who worked at the Bambers' farm before and after the August 1985 murders, told a new investigation: 'He'd wear lipstick, eye shadow, and paint his eyelashes and put on make-up.'

Sheila Caffell, Jeremy Bamber's adoptive sister, and her twin sons Daniel and Nicholas, six, were killed

'He used to do outrageous things that used to upset Mr Bamber.  He was a Jekyll and Hyde character.'

Mrs Wilson said the the atmosphere at the Bambers' White House Farm in Tolleshunt d'Arcy changed dramatically a few months before the killings.

It was alleged that Bamber had stumbled across his parents' wills and was outraged to discover he was to share their wealth equally with his adopted sister, Sheila.

Despite being set to 
receive around £400,000, worth around £1million today, it was said 
that he decided to kill Sheila and anyone else who might have a claim to
the money to ensure he got it all.

On the night of 7 August 1985, 25 rounds were shot at the farmhouse, leaving Nevill and June, Sheila, and her sons Daniel and NIcholas, dead.  The small boys had been shot in the head.

The Bambers' farm secretary said there was 'a lot of bickering' in the run-up to the murders, and said the elder Mr Bamber, who looked tired and worried, told her he feared something appalling was going to happen.

Mrs Wilson said: 'For some weeks he looked really drawn and ill.  He seemed to stoop and seemed to have the worries of the world on his shoulders.

'I thought he might have cancer... He said he hadn't got anything like that but he had got great problems.

'I
asked him to elaborate and he said that he thought he might die.  I 
said "What makes you think that?" and he said there might be a serious 
shooting accident.'

'Knowing what had been going on, [I] thought that he knew that Jeremy was going to perhaps shoot him.'

Bamber was said to envy his sister, 
nicknamed Bambi, and the attention she and her two sons got from Nevill 
Bamber, a former RAF pilot, and his wife.

Police initially accepted Bamber's 
version that his sister had had a psychotic episode and shot her whole 
family dead before shooting herself, and was seen sobbing at his 
family's funerals.  He said he was alerted to the tragedy when his father rang him in the middle of the night to say that Sheila had gone mad, before the phone went dead.

But detectives became suspicious of 
his behaviour, and when Bamber's then girlfriend Julie told police he'd confessed to her, they pieced together the truth.

Prosecutors said Bamber's theory was impossible because a silencer was found hidden
in a cupboard with Sheila's blood on it, and he was was found guilty on
a 10-2 majority verdict.

The prosecution said he shot his family dead, 
leaving the gun and an open Bible beside his sister to make it look as 
if she killed herself last, before climbing out of a window and cycling 
three miles home to the cottage his father had given him.

Bamber was sentenced to life in prison
at the Old Bailey in 1986.

In a TV interview for tomorrow's 
documentary, Countdown To Murder, Mrs Wilson said that Bamber tried to 
provoke his mother, June, by riding his bike round and round her in 
circles, trying to knock her with the bicycle.

On another occasion, he left a bag of live rats in his mother's car.

Mrs Wilson added: 'Jeremy would put over a face of being a very sort of nice person and then he would go and do something really nasty...

She said that when Bamber took over his father's farm after the murders, she never once saw him grieving for his family.

'I wanted to shout out to him "I know what you've done" but I didn't have the guts to do it....

'I think I might have ended up the same way as Mr and Mrs Bamber.'

In court it was argued that without a silencer, the 25 shots that were fired would have alerted the victims to the danger.  And if the silencer had been attached to the gun, it would have been too long for Sheila to have shot herself with it.

The prosecution argued that Jeremy Bamber had no interest in inheriting his father's business, but wanted the £436,000 family fortune. 

When Nevill Bamber offered his son a job on the farm in 1986, it was the catalyst for the younger man, who lived in a cottage provided by his parents a few miles away, to plan a way to get the money for himself.

Bamber, one of only 38 prisoners in England and Wales serving a whole-life sentence, has pleaded innocence consistently since he was sent to jail in September 1986.

However despite several appeals and reviews, and despite former Tory MP Andrew Hunter saying last month that he believed Bamber was innocent, the mass murderer remains in jail.

Slaughter At The Farm: Countdown To Murder will be shown on Channel 5 tomorrow at 9pm.
