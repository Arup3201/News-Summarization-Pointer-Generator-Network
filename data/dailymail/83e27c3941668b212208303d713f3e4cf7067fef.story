London offered our men platform heels and string vests, while Milan pushed woolly pants, fur gilets and 'manty-hose' (that's tights for men, by the way). If we thought Paris would be any kinder, we were wrong.

On day one of the French fashion week, Belgian designer Walter Van Beirendonck presented an eclectic collection seemingly inspired by ladies hats, circus Lycra, tapestry, sportswear, eccentric European folklore and an ironic take on the Native American headdress.

Cloche-style headgear with fastened Busby straps topped off tailored jackets and tight, bright leggings, finished with high-top trainers. Mismatched stripes and clashing colours and fabrics featured heavily.

Many headpieces and hats featured spray painted feathers with silly and serious messages on the first day of Paris men's fashion week

Van Beirendonck's message for FW14/14 was clear: Stop Racism.

The message was spray-painted in red across the largest, oversized headdress of the collection - a white feathered Native American-inspired piece shaped into what could be perceived as a middle finger.

It could be a dig at Chanel designer Karl Lagerfeld, whose pre-fall 2014 collection featured models wearing Native American-inspired headdresses in Dallas last month.

Feminine touches like baby pink and ruffles peeked beneath the loud and proud two-pieces

Political posturing aside, Van Beirendonck's sense of humour and style shone through.

In Vivienne Westwood-style outlandishness the desginer flaunted feminine touches like baby pink and ruffles, peeking from beneath colour-clashing two-pieces and fuzzy 
outerwear. His portrait was even immortalised on an appliquÃ© jumper complete with fringed facial hair.

Once he had shown his collection the designer, 57, came out to take a bow, looking as eccentric as his collection with his full bushy beard, orange top and high-top trainers.

Meanwhile, Japanese designer Yusuke Takahashi for Issey Miyake's men's FW 14/15 collection also turned heads in Paris.

Scrunched-up shirts covered in multicoloured paint splashes and iridescent foil quilted jackets were just some of then outlandish designs presented from the avant-garde fashion house.

Some models even appeared to silently mock each other's outfits - even though they were wearing exactly the same.
