Singer Connie Talbot was a huge hit when she appeared on the very first series of Britain's Got Talent - but her star failed to rise in the UK as Simon Cowell pulled out of a record deal with her.

But Connie, 13, from Streetly, West Mids has proved the music mogul wrong after becoming a star in Asia.

Back in 2007 Cowell promised the sweet, gap toothed girl he would make her Â£1 million after her rendition of Somewhere Over The Rainbow, but his record company pulled out of the deal at the last minute because of her age.

But since then Connie has gone from strength to strength performing in front of sell-out crowds to an army of fans across the globe.

Now a teenager, she is preparing to tour Asia again in the summer in front of thousands in South Korea, Malaysia and China.

She has attracted over a billion views on her YouTube channel - which boasts more than 600,000 subscribers. That's more than X Factor winners Leona Lewis and Joe McElderry.

Connie lives with her family and attends a local school, only performing during Christmas, Easter and summer holidays.

Incredibly, she has no management company behind her with mother Sharon, 44, and father Gavin, 46, still handling all of her bookings.

Today Sharon, a full-time mother, said: 'She's come a long way - she's a teenage girl now but she's remained so grounded.

'She can now play the piano and play the guitar and her dedication has paid off - she is massive in Asia, we just cannot believe it.

'Her school life is still important and she is doing really well and we only perform in holiday times and she's never been in such demand.

'She's a megastar in Asia but over half of her YouTube views, which are well over a billion now, come from the US.

Connie wowed judges Simon Cowell and Amanda Holden, who were very impressed with her

'Maybe that's what is next for her - you just never know she might crack America. I'm so proud of her. 'Hopefully
 Simon Cowell realises now he perhaps shouldn't have let her go but 
we're not bitter, it was probably the right decision at the time.

'We are very thankful and amazed how far she has made it just by herself and we want her to keep her feet on the ground

'She is turning into a teenager but doesn't really show an interest in boys yet, well not that she's telling me anyway.'

Connie has more than 158,000 Twitter followers and most recently played to sell-out crowds in South Korea.

Forthcoming concerts will be in Indonesia and Taiwan this summer and she has met a string of famous faces from George Clooney and Carly Rae Jepson to The Wanted.

Connie, who has a brother Joshua, 20, and a sister Mollie, 19, said: 'Hopefully in the future I will be doing my own songs and I'm practising my instruments all the time.

'My friends at school are just normal, they treat me the same as everyone else, I don't really know if I'm famous or not.

'I think it [what happened with Simon Cowell] was the right choice, I was too young to do a lot of stuff at that time.

'I still watch Britain's Got Talent, I liked Attraction [Hungarian dance group who won last year], I thought they were amazing.

'Their audition made me cry. I think it doesn't matter where you come from as long as you can enjoy it.

'I am going to Asia again in July and December. They do give us lots of nice hotels and look after us so I love going there.

'I hope one day I can be as big a pop star like Taylor Swift or Demi Lovato.'

Connie's debut album sold 250,000 copies and went to number one in three different countries.

In 2010 she sang in front 400 million people at China's New Year celebrations and opened a special concert celebrating South Korea's hosting of the G20 summit of world leaders the same year.

More recently, she also performed in three sell out concerts during a week-long tour during the Easter Break this year.

It promoted her album Beautiful World but also coincided with around the time of the tragic ferry disaster which rocked the whole country.

The kind-hearted teenager pledge the profits from her concerts to help the families of the victims affected by the tragedy.

Connie has attracted more than 1bn views on her YouTube channel and has more than 600,000 subscribers
