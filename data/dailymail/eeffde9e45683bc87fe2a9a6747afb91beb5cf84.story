A 95-year-old man's arm was elevated using a carrier bag and later a pillowcase after nurses struggled to find a specialised medical sling.

After waiting for 12 hours on a trolley at New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton, Joseph Ward's family were told staff would have to use a carrier bag to secure his arm.

When he was transferred to another ward, an orthopaedic doctor replaced the bag with a pillowcase, to help drain Mr Ward's arm of excess fluid. 

Mr Ward's daughter, Jane Crutchley, who said she was forced to go and buy a sling herself, has branded her father's treatment an 'outrage'.

Ms Crutchley said: 'It is outrageous that staff are so stretched they couldn't even get a sling for a 95-year-old man.

'In the end I was so frustrated that I went and bought one myself for £39.99.' 

But the hospital said the temporary slings were used to ensure the 95-year-old's medical needs were met and that he was not left in pain.

Mr Ward fell at his home in Wednesfield in the West Midlands on February 11.

He was found on the floor by a district nurse, who had visited the diabetic 95-year-old to give him his insulin. 

The nurse took him straight to A&E at New Cross Hospital.

There, medics told his family he needed a sling after they diagnosed  compartment syndrome - a painful, and potentially serious condition caused by swelling and bleeding in a bundle of muscles.

The condition is thought to have been caused by the pressure of Mr Ward lying on his arm all night. 

Medics said he needed his arm elevating to reduce the swelling and help drain the built-up fluid away.  

But his daughter claims staff 'couldn't find one (a sling) so they used a triangular bandage combined with a green carrier bag'.

She said: 'Later when he was moved to a different ward - diabetic ward C16 - they tried using a pillow case.'

Ms Crutchley claims her father still hadn't been given a specialised sling a week later, prompting her to take matters into her own hands.

She went to buy a sling herself, at a cost of £39.99.  

'His arm needed to be fixed at a specific angle to his shoulder and so a normal sling wasn't enough,' she said.

'So to find out that they were still using a plastic bag and a pillow case a week later was awful.

'It wasn't comfortable and he appeared to be in so much pain.

'Dad is fiercely independent and he lives in his own home. And at the moment it's been taken away from him.

'He's normally very with it but at the time he was so disorientated that I don't think he could protest.

'It's fortunate that my sister and I are there to look after him but so many other people are completely alone and don't have someone who can go and buy them the equipment they need.

'I'm no medic but he is still in pain and his arm doesn't appear to have improved at all.

'I feel that the delay in this could have slowed down the recovery to his arm.'

A spokesman for the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, which runs New Cross Hospital, said the trust's head of nursing Rose Baker has personally apologised to Mr Ward.

'With no Bradford sling in stock and to keep the patient comfortable while elevating his arm, staff on both wards used improvised slings and pillows,' he said.

'On ward C21 a temporary sling was made using a bag because it was cleanable and met hospital infection control standards.

'It was then replaced with a pillow case sling by an orthopaedic doctor on ward C16.

'This is a widely used and accepted practice to provide elevation. An alternative sling was then sourced from the fracture clinic which the patient is now using.

'At no time was the patient uncomfortable and his medical needs were met at all times. An incident report has been filed and any lessons learned will be shared with colleagues.

'The trust has agreed to reimburse the family the cost of the two Bradford slings which they purchased.'
