Former House Speaker Tom Foley has died at the age of 84, according to House Democratic sources.

Foley was a Washington state lawmaker who became the first speaker since the Civil War who failed to win re-election in his home district.

The courtly politician lost his seat in 
the 'Republican Revolution' of 1994. The Democrat had never served a 
single day in the minority.

He was defeated by Republican Spokane lawyer
George Nethercutt.

Foley served as U.S. ambassador to Japan for four years during the Clinton administration.

But he spent the most time in the House, serving 30 years including more than five as speaker.

The aides spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to be quoted by name.

House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) today issued the following statement honoring former House Foley.

Boehner said: 'Today the House mourns the loss of our beloved former colleague, Thomas S. Foley from the state of Washington. Born and raised in Spokane, Tom was elected to the House in 1964 from Washington’s Fifth Congressional District. Over the course of 15 terms and countless accomplishments, he rose to become chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Majority Whip, Majority Leader, and on June 6, 1989, the 57th Speaker of the House.

'It was a natural sequence for a natural leader.  Forthright and warmhearted, Tom Foley endeared himself not only to the wheat farmers back home but also colleagues on both sides of the aisle. That had a lot to do with his solid sense of fairness, which remains a model for any Speaker or representative. 

'Take it from the great Henry Hyde, who used to say of Tom: ''I wish he were a Republican.'' With his passing, the House loses one of its most devoted servants and the country loses a great statesman.

'The whole House extends its heartfelt sympathy to Tom’s wife, Heather, a longtime friend of this institution.  We will keep her and all of Tom’s friends and loved ones in our prayers.  He will be dearly missed.'
