A Canadian military veteran who was dutifully escorting the body of a dead soldier during a funeral procession was outraged after police pulled her over and gave her a ticket.  

Debbi Ferguson was stopped by an officer from Victoria Police during the somber procession to lay Private Steven Allen to rest on Remembrance Day in Victoria, Canada.

The 20-year military veteran said that her first thought when the officer pulled in behind her and flashed his lights was that he was going to help the motorcade.

But she was stunned when he issued her with a ticket for $230.

She said: ‘We were already in an emotional state and it was Remembrance Day. 

'It was hard on all of us veterans and soldiers that a fellow man at arms would pull me over and pull me out of this escort.’

She said that her car had a flag at half mast on it and her four-way flashers were on, so there was no way that police officer did not realize that her car was a part of the procession. 

She said: ‘He shouted out on his microphone to pull over immediately. We were just in shock.’ 

Ferguson told the officer that they were taking part in a funeral procession.

But he shot back that he didn't care, went to his car, and came back with the ticket.

She said: ‘I looked at him and I'm like I am sorry this is most disrespectful thing I have seen anyone do.’ 

Victoria police said Ferguson was given the ticket because her 'license plate was obstructed.'

The dead soldier, Allen, died during a military training exercise in Alberta, Canada. The military procession was taking his body from the airport to a funeral home. 

Meanwhile, Ferguson said that she was only trying to follow strict military codes which state that  no soldier is left behind.

She told CBC Victoria: ‘We never leave anyone behind and we never let a soldier come home alone.’    

A spokesperson for Victoria Police said in a statement that the action of its officer was ‘regrettable.’ 

‘We recognize that this report of a ticket being issued to fellow community members volunteering their time to see a compatriot home is regrettable. 

'This is especially true on a day when many members of our community, including many VicPD officers, were paying our own respects to the fallen.’
