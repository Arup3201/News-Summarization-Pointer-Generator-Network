Apology: A woman had to go to hospital after drinking a free coffee from Waitrose that contained cleaning fluid

A woman had to go to hospital after drinking a free coffee from Waitrose that contained cleaning fluid.

She felt ill after drinking the  coffee, given away in the store’s membership card scheme.

Paramedics were called to the Lewes, East Sussex branch of the supermarket and advised her to visit a specialist burns unit.

On a local internet forum her husband, who has not been named, said Waitrose offered his wife just £25.

He said they spent hours at the Royal Sussex County Hospital in Brighton.

He wrote: ‘Maybe they hadn’t rinsed the machine out, so she ended up drinking a cup of coffee containing cleaning chemicals and then we both spent the  morning in Brighton A&E.

‘She’s still in some discomfort but will probably be OK.’

Five days later, he added: ‘My wife is still unwell and we just received a letter of apology from Waitrose with a £25 voucher.

‘Am I the only the only one who thinks that’s not really compensatory for the injury and suffering, having to spend hours in A&E, missing a weekend away etc?’ 

A South East Coast Ambulance spokesman said: ‘We were called to a woman who suffered a reaction in her mouth after drinking coffee which was thought to contain a cleaning solution.’

She added: ‘The patient was assessed and treated on scene before being advised to attend Queen Victoria Hospital.’

Queen Victoria Hospital in West Sussex cares for burn victims.

There have been concerns that Waitrose’s free coffee offer takes custom from local coffee shops.Responding
 to the husband’s post, one Lewes resident said: ‘Hope your wife has 
fully recovered. I believe she has served the town of Lewes a huge 
service. Waitrose will stick to being a grocery store and not try to be 
coffee shop/dry cleaner/newsagent . . . as they have in many towns.’

A
 Waitrose spokesman said it was sorry for the ‘unfortunate incident’, 
adding: ‘A customer accidentally received some very diluted cleaning 
fluid in her hot drink. Our branch first aider immediately attended the 
 customer and, as a precaution, called an ambulance.

‘We have confirmed that the cleaning fluid does not have any long term impact on health.’
