The sister of the terror suspect accused of hacking a soldier to death smiled yesterday as she was escorted from her home and got into a police car.

Blessing Adebolajo, 32, was led from her property yesterday morning just hours after her brother Michael, 28, was filmed ranting with blood on his hands yards from the body of the murdered soldier in Woolwich.

Blessing was carrying a bag full of clothes as she got into an unmarked police vehicle outside her flat in Romford, Essex, at 8.10am.

It is understood she was not arrested, but police will undoubtedly want to question her about her brother who neighbours said was seen regularly at the house.

A woman purporting to be Adebolajo's sister told the Romford Recorder newspaper yesterday: 'We didn't know he was going to do this.'

Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale, 22, have been identified as the men suspected of murdering Drummer Lee Rigby.

Blessing - who has also gone by the surname Daniels - lives on the top floor of the property and used to share the home with her terror suspect brother, neighbours told The Times.

Graham Wells, 30, claimed that Adebolajo smoked drugs when he was staying there.

'He liked to smoke a bit of green (marijuana). We played football, a kick-about on the courts. He was a big lad, not the sort of guy you'd want to cross,' he told the newspaper.

'He used to be a normal bloke. he always had a big smile on his face. he'd say "All right Wellsy, all right boy, what's happening?".'

Police also raided a home in Saxilby, Lincolnshire, yesterday which is believed to belong to the terror suspect's father Anthony, 56.

In a chilling rant captured on camera the other side of the road from where drummer Lee Rigby, 25, lay dead, the suspect named as Adebolajo declared: 'The only reason we have killed this man today is because Muslims are dying daily by British soldiers.'

Former schoolfriends of Adebolajo 
said yesterday he was a 'bright and witty' boy who came from a devoutly 
Christian family. However, he is understood to have converted to Islam 
in around 2003.

His mother 
and father are hard-working Nigerian immigrants from an academic family 
in West Africa who settled in London in the early 1980s.

Virtually
all the friends on his Facebook page have traditional British names 
such as Louise, Kelly, Robert, Craig, Gemma, Lauren and Paul, to name a 
few. Among them is Matthew Selt, now a professional snooker player.

He
was 'just a lovely, lovely guy', in the words of former classmate 
Stephen Cavalier – who, as a serving PC in the Metropolitan Police – 
could scarcely have followed a different path.

Speaking
at his home in Essex yesterday, Mr Cavalier said: 'It seems odd to say 
it now, after the events of yesterday, but I remember him as just a 
lovely, lovely guy.

'I knew Michael at Marshalls Park School in Romford when we were teenagers. He was a good sportsman and just an all-round nice guy.'

He said he was no longer close to Adebolajo, who had requested they become 'Facebook friends' a few years ago.

'As soon as I saw the news last night I immediately recognised it was Michael. I was in shock really when I saw him.'

Previously: Michael Adebolajo was in a group of Muslim extremists who fought with police outside the Old Bailey in 2006. He had been arguing that he had the right to 'behead those who insult Islam'

Throughout the frenzied attack the two killers 
shouted ‘Allah Akbar’ – Arabic for ‘God is great’ – then demanded 
horrified witnesses film them as they ranted over the  crumpled body.

The two black men in their 20s, waited
calmly for armed police to arrive before charging at officers 
brandishing a rusty revolver, knives and meat cleavers.

When the old pistol was shot towards police it backfired and blew the thumb off one of the men.

Moments later they were cut down in a 
hail of bullets believed to be fired by a woman marksman. Last night 
both men were being treated in hospital for their wounds and will face questioning.
