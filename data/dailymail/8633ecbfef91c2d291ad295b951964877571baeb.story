She is California's most fashionable resident, and has mansion-hopped along the Californian coast since 1962.

And now, after just one year in her current Malibu Dreamhouse, Barbie has put her palatial, three-storey home on the market, and is moving into a new, even grander pad.

And who better to have designed the new mansion than the Duchess of Cambridge's favourite designer, Roksanda Ilincic?

The Serbian-born, London-based clothes-maker, whose celebrity fans also include Michelle
 Obama, Samantha Cameron, Keira Knightley and Gwyneth Paltrow, will 
give Barbie's Dreamhouse a stylish makeover, to be unveiled on fashion 
site SHOWstudio.com in the next few months.

New design: Roksanda Ilincic, left with Paul Smith and Samantha Cameron, counts the Prime Minister's wife as one of 
her greatest fans, and is giving Barbie's dreamhouse a makeover. She 
designed a new outfit for her back in 2009, right

This isn't the first time that she has worked with the iconic doll, she created a stylish outfit for her back in 2009 as part of her 50th birthday celebrations.

Speaking about her latest commission, Ilincic said: 'Having previously dressed Barbie to commemorate her 
50th anniversary, I think I have a good idea how her 21st century pad 
should look.

'SHOWstudio is the perfect partner to enable me to do this, while Barbie is the perfect front row guest!'

The house will be inspired by 
vibrant London, featuring plenty of concrete and a little less pink than
 Barbie has become famous for embracing.

Having studied architecture at Belgrade 
University and fashion design at the Faculty of Applied Arts, before 
coming to London to study at Central Saint Martins, Ilincic knew exactly what she was doing.

Barbie has called Malibu her home since 1971, hitting the sand in her pastel blue bathing suit and sun-kissed tan. Building
 a long résumé of careers, reuniting with her boyfriend Ken, and filming
 her own reality show, she felt it was time to spread her wings.

Modern day: Barbie's current Dreamhouse, built in 2012, features modern day luxuries including a flat screen TV, an elevator and a whirlpool tub

The Barbie Dreamhouse debuted in 
1962, providing girls with the backdrop to play house with Barbie, truly
 bringing to life Ruth Handler’s vision that Barbie allows girls to role
 play real life scenarios. Over
 the past 50 years the much-loved house has been renovated and 
redesigned more than 10 times and transitioned from cardboard to 
plastic. 

Each 
Dreamhouse is representative of the era the house was built in and is a 
reflection of the time with unique architectural features and interior 
design details.

The original Dreamhouse was $8.00 
(£5), and made of cardboard with simple flat painted details, sleek 
furniture, a combination television/stereo console, and a Dream Closet 
with pink plastic hangers. The 1962 Dreamhouse reflected the aesthetic 
and design of the time.

In
 1974 Barbie moved into a three-story Dreamhouse that included a 
‘working’ elevator and is considered to be one of the most iconic 
houses. 

By 1979 
Barbie had upgraded from a cardboard house to plastic with a new 
Dreamhouse that featured lots of details and accessories from planters 
and shutters to doors and windows – the symmetrical architecture and 
‘A-frame’ roof was a reflection of architecture during the time.

The
 ‘90s brought the Dreamhouse to a new level with the Magical Mansion 
that featured working sound and light electronics like a ringing 
telephone and doorbell, a lit fireplace and chandelier. 

The current Dreamhouse features modern day luxuries including a flat screen TV, an elevator and a whirlpool tub.

And there is no doubt that Ilincic's will be the most stylish to date.

To mark the new collaboration, FEMAIL took a look back at all Barbie's former homes:

First of its kind: The original 1962 Dreamhouse was $8.00 (£5), and made of cardboard with simple flat painted details

Moving on up: In 1974 Barbie moved into a three-storey Dreamhouse that included a 'working' elevator, and is considered to be one of the most iconic houses

Upgrade: By 1979 Barbie had upgraded from a cardboard house to plastic with a new Dreamhouse that featured lots of details and accessories

Swanky: The Dreamhouse has undergone many changes over the last 50 years, this 1983 townhouse is super swanky

Dream cottage of 1984: The Barbie Dreamhouse provides girls with the backdrop to play house with Barbie, truly bringing to life Ruth Handler's vision that Barbie allows girls to role play real life scenarios

Seeing pink: Everything from the beds to the lights were painted in Barbie's iconic pink, just like in this 1990's house

Upgrade after upgrade: The '90s brought the Dreamhouse to a new level with the Magical Mansion that featured working sound and light electronics
