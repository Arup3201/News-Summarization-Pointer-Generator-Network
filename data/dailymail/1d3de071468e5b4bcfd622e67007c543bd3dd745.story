New York Yankees third baseman Alex 'A-Rod' Rodriguez was busted in a hotel ladies' restroom after a 20-minute encounter with someone who was not his girlfriend, it has been reported.

The baseball star, 38, who is busy fighting claims he tested positive for a banned substance, reportedly got 'hot and heavy' with a mystery brunette after a meal at the UMI Sushi and Sake Bar on Miami's South Beach on Saturday night.

The pair showed their affection in the lobby of the Delano Hotel before disappearing into a ladies' restroom, New York Daily News Confidenti@l said.

It is claimed they emerged flustered 20 minutes later after being interrupted by a hotel guest.

Sources told the New York Daily News the woman was not A-Rod's girlfriend, Playboy cover star and WWE wrestler Torrie Wilson.

The star pair have been dating since 2011 after A-Rod's high-profile break-up with the actress Cameron Diaz.

But there was no hint of trouble on Monday night, when A-Rod and Torrie attended a night devoted to Yankees legend Mariano 'Mo' Rivera.

Torrie posted a picture of her and her smiling boyfriend on Instagram, adding: 'So cool to spend a night honoring Mariano Rivera!'

A spokesman for the hotel told the Daily News: 'We don’t comment on guests on property. The property has no knowledge of the situation in question on Saturday evening.'

No one has commented so far on behalf of A-Rod.

The baseball star put his sprawling Miami mansion up for sale last year for $38 million, and he and girlfriend Torrie Wilson were later spotted hunting for a new love nest in Beverly Hills.

Last week it was claimed the third baseman had tested positive for a banned substance in 2006 - but the results were never disclosed because a Major League player must fail two drug tests before his name is released.

A-Rod's legal team denied the claims and accused senior baseball figures of leaking 'federally protected medical information' to win a legal battle with the 38-year-old.

He is trying to overturn a 211-game ban imposed by Major League Baseball officials on him and 13 other players in August for allegedly violating doping rules.

It is claimed the now-defunct Biogenesis of America clinic in Miami was the headquarters of a widespread South Florida doping ring which included Rodriguez.

A-Rod denies wrongdoing and has sued MLB and its commissioner.
