Failures: Dr Bijan Saha is facing sanctions after being accused of taking mobile phone calls during appointments, storing drugs dangerously and failing to respect patients' privacy

An elderly doctor is facing sanctions after being accused of taking mobile phone calls during appointments, storing drugs dangerously and failing to respect patients’ privacy.

Patients described Dr Bijan Saha as ‘terrible’ and advised others to avoid his surgery ‘like the plague’.

They complained the 73-year-old GP discussed private medical conditions in front of reception staff and other patients, and took personal calls during consultations.

Others complained he wrote prescriptions for them before they had even described their symptoms.

The surgery in Sittingbourne, Kent, where Dr Saha is the only GP, was found to have serious failings after an unannounced inspection by the Care Quality Commission.

It found he was failing to meet all 11 standards that are monitored and this was having a major impact on patients. The CQC would not discuss the nature of the action it is taking for legal reasons. Patients had difficulty making appointments at the practice – which closes for five hours in the middle of each day – and were forced to use other  services such as walk-in centres.

One, Brian Woodruff said he changed surgeries after his ‘awful’ experience there. The 52-year-old, who runs a dog-sitting business, said: ‘Dr Saha is just a rude man. When you went in to speak to him he had never finished his notes on the previous patient. He wouldn’t listen to anything you told him.

‘I suffered with depression and I felt he just fobbed me off with a prescription or some pills. I’ve changed doctors and feel so much better.’

Another patient said: ‘I’ve been with this surgery for 13 years and it just gets worse. What do I pay national insurance for? When I need a doctor I can’t get an appointment. When I do see the doctor, they never listen and are writing a prescription before I’ve even finished my first sentence.’

One patient said of the surgery online: ‘Twice during my consultation the doctor answered their mobile phone and from the conversation that I heard was discussing matters unconnected with the surgery.

‘I would advise anyone considering this GP practice to avoid it like the plague.’ Another said: ‘This is a terrible surgery. The staff are rude and never answer the phone.’

Damningly, the report revealed: ‘Medicines were not handled appropriately or stored correctly. Medication prescribed for a named individual was being used for general administration to others.

‘Repeat prescriptions were issued without reviews, and were often printed by administrative staff. This procedure had led to a prescribing error which could have had very serious consequences. There were no formal processes to ensure security of prescription pads or stocktaking of medicines.’ Staff who chaperoned people during intimate procedures had not been give criminal records checks.

In addition, the waiting area was found to be dirty, with all the waiting room chairs badly stained.

Michele Golden, CQC’s head of GP inspection in the South, said: ‘The issues we have identified at Dr Saha’s practice are very serious. People using this practice are currently at unacceptable levels of risk.’

Dr Saha, who could earn up to £82,789 a year, was pictured yesterday during his five-hour break getting into his car with a personalised number plate. He said: ‘I’m extremely sorry, I don’t want to say anything.’
