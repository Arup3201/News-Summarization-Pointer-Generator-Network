A woman escaped an explosion after an e-cigarette plugged into a faulty charger set her family home on fire.

The woman was alerted to the blaze in an upstairs bedroom of the house in Ringwood, Hampshire, by her smoke alarm - which had only had its battery changed the previous week.

She managed to escape downstairs before the explosion, caused by the heating of a pressurised canister of an air horn that was in the room.

The blaze is the latest in a string of incidents in the UK thought to be caused by cheap or faulty chargers

Investigators from Hampshire Fire and Rescue Service traced the fire’s ignition to a USB plug charging an e-cigarette.

Dan Tasker, group manager from the service, said: ‘We discovered that the woman’s son had lost the charger that came with the e-cigarette kit he had bought, so he had plugged it into a different USB charger and then gone out.

‘This then overheated and caught light to the bedding, and the fire then caused the canister to expand and explode.’

He added: ‘Plugs need to be appropriate for the device they are charging and not all can be transferred between devices.

‘The consequences of using the wrong charger with the wrong device can be devastating and we are extremely relieved that on this occasion no-one was harmed.’

It is the latest in a string of incidents in the UK involving the use of cheap or inappropriate chargers.

In May, a Welsh woman was burned after her e-cigarette exploded when it was plugged into her phone charger and a barmaid in North Yorkshire was also injured earlier this year when a charging e-cigarette overheated.

While 
e-cigarettes can be susceptible to overheating due to the type of 
battery they contain, Hampshire’s Trading Standards have stressed the 
importance of using the right charger for all devices and raise 
awareness of the dangers of cheap alternatives.

A
 spokesman from Hampshire County Council Trading Standards said: ‘The 
message is do not buy cheap or unbranded chargers for use with 
e-cigarettes, mobile phones or any other devices. They are invariably 
dangerous and illegal.

‘At
 the least, they are capable of destroying your device. At worst, they 
have the potential to give a fatal electric shock or cause a very 
serious house fire.

‘Our
 officers regularly stop and destroy large quantities of unsafe chargers
 as part of their work at ports. This is a widespread problem, with many
 being sold through internet sellers.

‘Always make sure that the rated output of your charger is matched to the product you are charging.’
