A shameless motorist has had his car seized after running up a staggering £18,000 of parking fines in just over a year.

The mystery driver was ticketed 220 times in different spots around a city centre after repeatedly parking without ever paying or displaying a permit.

After each fine was ignored, officials have now lost patience and impounded the 13-year-old light blue Peugeot 206.

But the £18,000 debt is far more than the £15,000 a brand new one would cost, and as this vehicle is more than a decade old it is worth substantially less.

Clampdown: This is the moment a shameless motorist's Peugeot 206 was seized after they ran up £18,000 of fines in a year - substantially more than the car is worth

The saga began when the car, which is registered to a man, was first issued with a parking ticket in Portsmouth, Hampshire, on February 20, 2012.

The driver then went on to park in a host of city council car parks and streets where a permit is required.

When repeated efforts by Portsmouth City Council and contracted bailiffs to contact the owner failed, the hatchback was finally clamped and seized.

The council used its parking enforcement powers to take the car as the owner failed to pay after three penalty notices and made no effort to get in touch.

Vehicles removed by the council can be destroyed if the owner doesn't make contact and pay outstanding fines, including removal and storage fees.

Cllr Jason Fazackarley, Portsmouth City Council's cabinet member for traffic and transportation, explained why they seized the car.

He said: 'This is an extreme case which is why we have taken the necessary action to seize the vehicle after a blatant disregard by the owner. In addition to seizing the vehicle we will pursue legal action to recover the outstanding debt owned.'

Michael Robinson, Portsmouth City Council's parking manager, insisted the council will continue to pursue the owner until they pay back the 18,000 pounds.

He said: 'Although the car has been seized we won't give up pursuing the owner until they come forward and the outstanding debt is settled.

'The amount of fines this motorist ran up shows a lack of respect for all road users, so we used our enforcement powers to take action against this persistent offender.'
