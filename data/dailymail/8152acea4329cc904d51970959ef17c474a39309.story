For more than 50 years, Lego toys have been an integral part of the British Christmas – but never quite like this.

Duncan Titmarsh, the only Lego certified professional in the UK, and his team of helpers took 32 days and 700,000 bricks to build the giant sleigh, right, with Santa and nine reindeer led by Rudolph.

Toby Fisher, eight, was the first lucky youngster to climb aboard the sleigh, which is delighting shoppers at Covent Garden in Central London.

The sleigh was created at Duncan’s Bright Bricks workshop in Bordon, Hampshire. Designer Kevin Cooper drew it, before it was converted into a 3D computer diagram.

Each component is built on specially made steel pallets, and the legs of each reindeer are reinforced with metal frames.

Duncan’s other creations include a 90ft Christmas tree, a huge tiger cub for fashion designer Stella McCartney, and a portrait of the Queen for the window of toy store Hamleys.
