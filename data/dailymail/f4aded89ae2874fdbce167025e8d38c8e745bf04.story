Two nurses who were allegedly attacked by Douglas Kennedy as he tried to take out his three-day-old son from their hospital both revealed today they are still suffering emotionally and physically.

Anna Margaret Lane and Cari Maleman Luciano were involved in a vicious scuffle with the late Robert F. Kennedy’s son on January 7 at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, New York.

Douglas Kennedy, 44, tried to get in a lift with his son Bo to give the baby some fresh air - but he was not allowed to take the boy outside and the nurses blocked his path, they claimed on MSNBC.

‘We kept saying to him: “We need to step out of the elevator, we need to get the baby to your room”,’ Ms Luciano said, adding that Mr Kennedy replied: ‘I don't have to listen to you. It's my child.’

Mr Kennedy claims that as he was leaning against a door to back out of the maternity ward, a nurse came toward him, he lifted his left knee and it came into contact with the nurse to protect his son.

That nurse, Ms Luciano, fell backwards and Ms Lane then accused Kennedy of twisting her arm. But Mr Kennedy denies this. He returned the baby to the maternity ward rather than go outside.

‘I still have pain in my arm,’ Ms Lane told MSNBC. Ms Luciano added: ‘I wanted to make sure the baby was safe and secure and he brought his leg up and kicked me. I went flying through the air.’

Fall: Mr Kennedy is also said to have twisted the arm of a nurse who tried to block his way in January

Fox News reporter Mr Kennedy, who is married to Molly, is the son of late politician Robert ‘RFK’ Kennedy - brother of former president John ‘JFK’ Kennedy. RFK was fatally shot in 1968.

‘It is sickening to think that our simple desire to take our son outside for fresh air has been warped into a charge of child endangerment,’ Douglas and Ethel Kennedy said in a statement.

Mr Kennedy, the 10th child of Robert F. Kennedy and Ethel Kennedy, still maintains he did nothing wrong and was arraigned last week in Mount Kisco, New York, on the charges, his defence lawyer Robert Gottlieb said.

He is next due in court in April. But Mr Gottlieb claimed his client had already received permission from other nurses to leave the hospital and so it wasn’t right that his path was blocked.

Charges: Douglas Kennedy, pictured with wife Molly and their son Bo, or 'Boru', was charged over the fracas

Scene: The altercation happened at the Northern Westchester Hospital in suburban New York on January 7

Family: Mr Kennedy is pictured as a baby with his parents Bobby and Ethel Kennedy, months before the assassination of the former Attorney General and presidential candidate

Dr Timothy Haydock, an emergency room 
physician at the hospital and a close Kennedy family friend, claimed ‘unequivocally that the nurses were the only 
aggressors’.

But Ms Luciano's husband Steve told 
the New York Daily News his 5ft wife was simply trying to ensure that Mr
Kennedy followed hospital rules when he wanted to take his son Bo for a
walk.

Ms Lane told MSNBC she was only doing her job and the whole experience was ‘traumatic’.

Robert
Kennedy was a U.S. senator, Attorney General and presidential 
candidate assassinated in June 1968 in Los Angeles, California, five 
years after the death of his brother JFK.
