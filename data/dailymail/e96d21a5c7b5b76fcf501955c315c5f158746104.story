We all have our dreams - even the most famous and successful among us cling to lingering fantasies.

Carl Froch, Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather are no exceptions.

The prize-ring is the toughest work-place in sport but those notions can still be romantic.

CARL FROCH

The Nottingham Cobra admits that winning the world super-middleweight title, climbing into the top 10 in the world pound-for-pound rankings and making history by filling Wembley Stadium for his record-breaking fight with George Groves were all achievements beyond his wildest imagination when he first laced up the gloves.

But one last ambition remains and Froch is fighting to make it reality with all the ferocity he musters inside the ropes.

The dream is to climax his career by boxing in Las Vegas, the fight capital of the world.

As circumstances appeared to be conspiring against him, Froch went gunning for that right.

It would have been more convenient – not to mention more enriching – for his promoter Eddie Hearn to match him against stablemate James DeGale in another domestic dust-up. To that end he manoeuvred DeGale into position as mandatory challenger for one of Froch’s world titles.

The IBF, to their discredit, have threatened to strip Froch of that title unless he boxes DeGale next.

Never mind that he was worn their belt with distinction. Nor that he has made two successive mandatory defences against Groves and morally merits a dispensation from their rules so he can make a voluntary defence or a contest a championship unification bout.

To which Froch says: ‘I will happily vacate this title in order to get a fight in Vegas.’

Which is a polite way of telling IBF president Daryl Peoples where to stick his belt unless his organisation – which has a history of corruption, racketeering and being monitored by federal investigators - cuts him some slack.

As his promoter’s biggest cash cow, Froch has also warned Hearn that he will retire unless he books him a glamour night on that famous Strip in the Nevada desert.

Hearn has duly responded by reopening talks with legendary US promoter Bob Arum for Froch to put his other, WBA belt on the line against Julio Cesar Chavez Jnr in Vegas early in the New Year.

Contractually that is not an easy fight to make but Froch is not only grafting to make it happen… but deserves nothing less.

MANNY PACQUIAO

The PacMan has risen from poverty in the Philippines to become the only eight-division world champion. He is also an elected politician who fights as fearlessly for his deprived and under-privileged countrymen as he does in the ring.

It is possible he will become president of the Philippines in due course – yet that lofty ambition has not been the fantasy for Pacquiao.

Despite being what some would call vertically challenged – at just 5ft 6in tall – he has nursed a long-cherished dream of playing professionally in the sport of bean-stalk giants.

If only for a few precious moments.

He made that come true on Sunday, even though he is now less than a month away from defending his world welterweight title in a fight he must win if he is ever to meet Mayweather in the richest fight of all time.

Pacquiao, a hoops fanatic, bought into the KIA Sorento team in the Philippines Basketball Association. 

Then he took over some of the coaching duties, while registering himself as a player.

Finally, with his usual propriety, he sought dispensation from his Hall of Fame boxing trainer Freddie Roach to take time out for Sunday’s game against Blackwater Elite.

For just seven minutes, he became possibly the shortest pro in basketball history.

Never mind that he gave the ball away twice. Kia went on to win.

And it was practice of sorts for his November 22 collision with undefeated New Yorker Chris Algieri, who is a good four inches the taller.

FLOYD MAYWEATHER

The man who calls himself Money has come from the wrong side of the tracks in America to earning more than $50million a fight as the No 1 pound-for-pound boxer on Earth.

All the world titles have brought with them the cash to splash with such extravagance as dropping hundred dollar bills on to night club dancefloors in his adopted home city of Las Vegas like so much confetti.

That is just one of Mayweather’s many crass displays of wealth.

Then there has been the jail time for assaulting the mother of three of his children, followed by a civil action filed against him by another girl friend for similar abuse.

Most recently he has been accused of staging and betting on fights to the finish in his gym, without breaks between rounds. That allegation of dangerous practice has been refuted once but re-opened by a law suit from two of the young boxers who claim to have been involved and damaged.

Not much romance there.

And yet, and yet… behind all the bling and bravura what Mayweather really, really wants is to go down in history as one of the greatest boxers of all time.

He craves that recognition as desperately as many desire true love. He makes that yearning public by wearing a baseball cap emblazoned with the capital initial letter T B E… The Best Ever.

Yet he knows in his heart this is not his distinction to bestow.

He thinks he might earn it by being the richest prize-fighter ever and preserving his long unbeaten record.

But he is to be raised to that lofty pinnacle occupied by Muhammad Ali, Sugar Ray Robinson and Sugar Ray Leonard then he has to do what they did – fight the best out there and take on the chin any defeat which may come his way.

In Mayweather’s case that means getting into the ring with Pacquaio, his closest rival for that mythical pound-for-pound honour, before one of them retires.

Which brings us to one of the dreams which we mere mortal observers of the fight game and its heroes share.

To see that fight happen.
