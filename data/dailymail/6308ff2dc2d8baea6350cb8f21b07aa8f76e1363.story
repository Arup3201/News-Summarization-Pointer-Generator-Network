Wolves club captain Sam Ricketts is poised to join League One promotion hopefuls Swindon Town.

The 33-year-old defender was a target for Coventry City last week with manager Tony Mowbray keen to add Ricketts' experience to his side.

However, he is now expected to join Swindon until the end of the season. 

Swindon, who are third in League One, do not have a game this weekend as scheduled opponents Walsall are playing Bristol City in the Johnstone's Paint Trophy final at Wembley.

The Wolves captain has made only four appearances for the Championship side this season

Wales international Ricketts, who has 52 caps, has been named in Chris Coleman's squad to face Israel in a Euro 2016 qualifier on 28 March. 

He has not played a competitive game for his parent club since November and was made available for loan in January.

He is out of contract in the summer and has only made four Championship appearances so far this season.
