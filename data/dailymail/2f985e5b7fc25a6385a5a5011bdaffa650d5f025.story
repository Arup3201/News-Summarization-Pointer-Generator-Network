The New York Jets have added another former Patriot to their roster in the shape of running back Stevan Ridley.

The 26-year-old has signed a one-year deal after suffering a tear to his right ACL last season.

He played just six games as the Patriots won their sixth straight AFC East title and went on to win the Super Bowl.

'Sending love to all my day one fans, and every team-mate I've had the pleasure to take the field with,' Ridley posted on Instagram.

'We all know it's a business, yet it's also a blessing. So either way you see it, you'll never understand.

'Love New England, Love my former team-mates and I'm truly thankful for the opportunity the Patriots organisation has blessed me with. However it's #ontotheJETS.' 

The Jets will hope Ridley reproduces the kind of form he showed in 2012, where he rushed for 1,263 yards and 12 touchdowns.

He joins Chris Ivory and Bilal Powell at running back in a revamped Jets offense, which features fellow free agent acquisitions Brandon Marshall and Ryan Fitzpatrick.

New head coach Todd Bowles has also taken Darrelle Revis back from the Patriots and Antonio Cromartie to bolster an already dominant defense.

'He's excited for the opportunity and his rehab is going strong at this point,' added his agent Andy Simms.
