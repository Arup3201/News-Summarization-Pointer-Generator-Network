They were so close, yet so far away.

Koalas, usually the type of species spotted grazing up in Eucalyptus trees, are perhaps not the brightest of animals after an unfortunate video shows a mother taking a leap of faith whilst carrying her baby on her back.

Unluckily for the pair, they didn't quite make it but they certainly gave a whole new meaning to 'drop bear' - the fictitious and vicious Australian marsupial.

The Australian native animal makes the decision to jump but unfortunately misses by a few centimetres

Also known as the Phascolarctos cinereus, the Australian native animals were filmed carefully climbing across a shed rooftop.

The mother reaches the edge, pauses for a few seconds and observes her surroundings - calculating the distance between the shed and a neighbouring tree.

Then she makes the decision to jump but unfortunately misses by few centimetres.

Chris Winter caught the action and uploaded it on YouTube, naming the video: 'Koala Fail...Drop Bears Exist'.
