A gang of teenage thugs who were jailed for an armed-robbery spree in which they blasted victims with a sawn-off shotgun are to appeal against their sentences claiming they are 'too young' for prison.

The five youngsters, two aged just 13 and 14, robbed shopkeepers and taxi drivers in Liverpool at gunpoint during a ten-day crimes spree that spread terror across the city.

One gang member, who had already racked up a host of previous convictions, was jailed indefinitely. Others were sentenced to between four and nine years following a trial in October last year.

Jailed: Jobe Kilbride, 13, poses with 
the shotgun used by him and others when they robbed taxis and shops. The gang are now to appeal against the length of their sentences at the High Court

Now their lawyers are taking a case to the High Court claiming the custodial sentences are unduly harsh considering their age.

During the brutal rampage  over the 2011 May Day bank holiday, one victim was shot in the neck while others, all chosen at random, had a loaded shotgun pointed in their faces.

Declan Kilbride (left) was locked up for nine years and Declan Culshaw (right), who acted as look-out in the gang's final robbery, was given five years

At the time Judge Mark Brown described the gang as capable of ‘ruthless villainy’ and of having ‘no sense of danger’.

Jailing them, he said people were ‘sick and tired’ of the gangs and gun crime that blighted Liverpool.

The judge ordered that all five 
teenagers should be named after they admitted armed robbery and firearms
offences at Liverpool Crown Court.

Their faces covered by hoods or simply by pulling up their jumpers, they carried out a string of opportunistic crimes.

In the first, a taxi driver was lured
to a quiet side street where he was confronted with a loaded shotgun, 
and robbed of his car and takings.

Just
24 hours later, another taxi driver became the gang’s next victim after
picking up three youths and driving them across the city.

As
they neared their destination, one of the thugs grabbed the handbrake 
while the driver was threatened with a shotgun. He also lost his car and
takings.

Later that day two youths with a shotgun burst into a shop and stole cash after threatening terrified staff.

Three days later the gang struck again at a convenience store where they helped themselves to cash and cigarettes.

The
final two crimes took place within minutes of each other. CCTV captured
the gang huddled in a bus stop in the Norris Green area of the city, 
then filing into another  convenience store and robbing it, leaving the 
lone member of staff cowering in the corner.

As they fled into a nearby estate, they were confronted by the shop’s owner who was on his way to his business after hearing what was going on.

They shot at Sri Lanka-born Rajeethan Pulendran and his friend Mani Mohan who was hit in the neck and chest, but escaped serious injury.

Campaign of fear: The gang's first crime was robbing a Quickhomesave store in Selwyn Street, Walton

Violent rampage: The boys threatened staff with a shotgun at the All in One convenience store in Huyton and stole cash and cigarettes

Ringleader Bradley Beveridge, 18, who
has already racked up a host of convictions, shouted abuse at the judge
as he was jailed indefinitely. Kilbride was given four years while his 
older brother Declan, 16, was locked up for nine years.

Declan
Culshaw, a 15-year-old who acted as look-out in the gang’s final 
robbery, was given five years while 14-year-old Dylan Currie was jailed 
for six years.

Judge Brown said the gang members had no respect for authority and ‘limited thinking skills’.

He said: ‘This case highlights the scourge of gun crime and gang  culture which we have in our  society today. The residents of those communities are sick and tired of it.’

Their appeal is scheduled to take place on June 21 with a decision expected the same day.
