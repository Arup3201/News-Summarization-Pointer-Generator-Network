A woman who fractured her neighbour's skull with a claw hammer has told the jury that she 'only wanted to knock him out'.

Lisa Williams, 49, admitting hitting David Coleman, 54, three times in the head with the hammer after a long-running dispute between their two families about a fence.

But she claimed she was acting in self-defence after Mr Coleman got into a fight with her brother and told the court she has 'learned  you don't knock people out with hammers'.

The families had been 'neighbours at war' for eight years and Mr Coleman claimed the Williams would throw dog faeces into the garden and bang on walls at night to stop them sleeping.

Mr Coleman from Chingford, north-east London, also claimed Williams hated him because he looked like her ex-partner.

A brawl erupted in June 2013 when Mr Coleman confronted Williams' brother Jonathan about mud smeared all over his front bay windows, Snaresbrook Crown court heard.

Jonathan Williams was said to have got the upper hand in the fight and pinned Mr Coleman to the ground before his sister emerged from their house brandishing a hammer.

Williams admitted striking Mr Coleman three times to the head with the hammer but claims she was acting in self-defence and denied causing grievous bodily harm with intent.

'I hit him three times on the head with the hammer, the third time I used more [force] than I used for the first two, I wanted to knock him out, I wanted him to stop,' she said.

When asked if she had stopped to think what type of injury a hammer blow would cause she said: 'No, I've since learned you don't knock people out with hammers - I thought he was going to kill us.'

She claimed at one point in the fight Mr Coleman was straddling her, saying: 'I think I was concussed, it was so quick - I was concussed, I was woolly headed and what followed was as a result of being woolly headed.

'It was awful, I couldn't think straight, Jonathan was trying to release Mr Coleman's grip from him - he wouldn't let go and he kept flailing his legs out at my brother's legs.'

'I was horrified, it's like you're fighting for your life, it's like the whole world is caving in.' 

She claimed that she stopped when her brother managed to grab the hammer out of her hands.

Other witnesses claim it was a third neighbour Bernard Mason, who ran from his home to break up the fight and disarm Williams. 

His wife Pamela Mason was forced to sit on her to restrain her until the police arrived, it has been claimed. 

The trial continues.
