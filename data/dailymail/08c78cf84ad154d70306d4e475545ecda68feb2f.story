A woman who was left in a coma with horrific burns after her car burst into flames during a driving lesson has married the boyfriend who stuck by her in the wake of the accident and helped her learn to walk again.

Lindsay Wood, 23, was left with life-changing injuries after her car collided with another during a driving lesson in September 2009 and erupted into a fireball.

The then 18-year-old, from Cornwall, suffered third degree burns to 42 per cent of her face and body and was in a coma for months after the accident.

Lindsay Wood, 23, has learnt to walk again and married her boyfriend Robert Wood (pictured on their wedding day), who stuck by her when she was left with life-changing injuries after her car burst into flames

Mrs Wood was just 18-years-old when her car collided with another and burst into flames during a driving lesson. She was left in a coma for months and suffered third degree burns to 42 per cent of her face and body

Mrs Wood, from Cornwall, was training to in beauty when she was involved in the collision which changed her life. She was pulling out of a T-junction and collided with a car, causing her vehicle to erupt in flames

She was initially taken to Treliske Hospital in Truro, Cornwall, but later transferred to the specialist Morriston Hospital in Swansea, where she eventually came out of her coma – only to spend several more months in hospital having treatment for her injuries.

As well as receiving specialist burns care, she also had to have some of her fingers amputated, several skin grafts and plastic surgery.

Mrs Wood, who was living with her parents Valerie and Robert, both now 48, at the time of the incident, had met her boyfriend Robert Wood just 11 months before the crash.

While she lay in a coma in hospital, her parents told Mr Wood, who was 21 at the time, that he didn't have to feel obliged to stick around when she was so ill.

However, he sat by her bedside every day and when he returned to work as a sales assistant, he drove up to see her every weekend.

Recounting the period leading up to the crash, Mrs Wood said: 'At the time life was great.

'I was hoping to go to college to study beauty and I'd been dating Robert for around 11 months after meeting in town.

'He's seen me around, liked the look of me and approached me. We went on a date and had hit it off straight away, but it was still early days.

'Passing my test would mean we could zip off to the beach and have weekends away. I couldn't wait.'

Mrs Wood met her boyfriend Robert Wood just 11 months prior to her crash and he chose to stay by her despite the fact her parents told him he shouldn't feel obliged to stay and care for her because of her injuries

She was initially taken to Treliske Hospital in Truro, Cornwall, but was later transferred to the specialist burns unit at Morriston Hospital in Swansea. Her hair had to be shaved off by doctors during her treatment

Mrs Wood was in a coma for several months and spent several more in hospital while she received specialist care for her burns and learnt to walk again. She said Robert stuck by her side and encouraged her throughout

However, her life changed when she was involved in the collision, which came during the final driving lesson before her test.

She recalled: 'I wasn't nervous as I had plenty of lessons and was confident. The drive was going well and I loved being behind the wheel.

'I remember crunching metal and a flash of light. It was like a bomb exploding.'

She doesn't remember anything after the impact of the collision and woke up in hospital several months later.

She said: 'I was in agony. As soon as I opened my eyes pain ripped through my whole body.

'Everything was white when I opened my eyes. I felt like I'd been asleep for months. My mouth was so dry.

'Robert was there too – he told me it was mid-October and I had been asleep for more than a month.

'I had been covered in flames. Thankfully I couldn't remember this.’

She said the driving instructor who was with her on the day of the crash, Shirley, escaped unscathed, as did the driver of the other vehicle.

She added: ‘I had third degree burns to 42 per cent of my body and had been put in an induced coma.

Mrs Wood met Robert just 11 months before the crash (pictured together before the incident, left and after, right). He visited her regularly in hospital and helped her walk again. They have now married and live together

'My face, arms and legs were covered in burns and I had undergone numerous operations while unconscious to remove the burnt skin.

'Surgeons had grafted skin from the backs of my thighs, the top of my arms and my bottom onto my burns. I couldn't take it in.

'All I really wanted to ask was “what do I look like?” but I was too scared. And the pained looked on everyone's faces said it all.

'I was a monster.'

Mrs Wood said it was around this time that she realised how special her then-future husband was.

'He never gave up on me,' she said.

'I would make my family get me ready for his visits. I made them brush my teeth and wash me.

'One day I asked dad why he wasn't brushing my hair. It turned out the doctors had shaved it off. I was gutted.

'But Robert didn't seem scared by the swathes of bandages covering my face, shaved hair or burnt skin.

'He told me on our first anniversary, when I'd been unconscious, he'd sat with me.

'When I asked him what he did, he said: “I chatted to you”.

'He impressed my parents – they thought he was a keeper.

'I thought he was too – he didn't seemed fazed by my mangled face, my bloody arms or stumped fingers – which were amputated as a result of the burns.

'When I got down he would say: “It'll get better” He was a constant presence, my shining light.'

After coming out of the coma, Mrs Wood faced the agonising prospect of learning to walk again.

She said: 'I was incredibly weak and couldn't even lift my arms.

'I couldn't walk and hadn't even tried to get out of bed. Nurses had to wash me lying down and I couldn't even go to the loo or eat properly.

'I felt like a baby learning to walk again. I repeatedly said I couldn't do it. Every step with my walking frame felt like a mile.

'I would shout out but Robert was always there.

'Despite only being 21 and working full-time as a sales assistant, he would come to the hospital, hold my hand and walk with me.

'He was fantastic. When I got depressed he told me he loved me.

'I told him to leave me, but he said I was beautiful and brave and he wouldn't.'

In December 2009, Mrs Wood was transferred from Swansea to Bodmin Hospital, nearer to her home in Cornwall, and her burns began to heal into scabs.

'Even though I thought I looked horrible Robert would still tell me he loved me,' she recalled. 'And he would add: “I fancy you too”.

'But it wasn't easy. I was in and out of hospital five days a week, having physiotherapy, stretching my muscles and learning to walk. It was exhausting.

'In November 2010 – more than a year after the crash – Robert was with me when I took my first step without a walking frame.

'From then, I walked everywhere I could. With Robert by my side.

'In August 2011 Robert and I were in St Austell in Cornwall when he led me to a jewellery shop and asked me to pick out a ring.

'He told me he was proud of me and a week later got down on one knee.

'As I looked at the pink sapphire glinting on my hand I didn't see scars I saw a beautiful gem.'

The pair married at St Petroc's Church in Bodmin in March 2013 and have since moved in together.

Mrs Wood, who now has a full-time job as a nursery nurse, has just been awarded £500,000 compensation for her injuries, paid for through insurance.

She also recently passed her driving test.

She said: 'When I think how far I've come I can't believe it.

'It's all thanks to my fantastic family and Robert.'
