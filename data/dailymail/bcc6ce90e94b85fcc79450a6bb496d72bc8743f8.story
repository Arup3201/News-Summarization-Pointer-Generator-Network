Controversial regulations in Sacramento now require all taxi drivers to speak English, and many people who make their living behind the wheel say that could put them out of a job.

The City Council passed several new rules requiring drivers to have proof of basic english skills, to drive cars eight years old or newer, and to wear professional clothing.

Kazman Zaidi, president of the Sacramento Taxicab Union, called the new regulations unnecessarily restrictive.

The Sacramento City Council passed several new rules requiring drivers to have proof of basic English skills

'Maybe they can’t read English, but they can understand, and they can answer the question and where the customer need to go,' he told CBS Sacramento. 

Zaidi guessed more than 100 of the area's 500 or so drivers would likely not be able to pass their tests regardless of how good they were at their jobs.

'If they don’t pass this english test, they have to lose their job, you know?' Zaidi said. 'And they will be out of business.'

Kazman Zaidi, president of the Sacramento Taxicab Union, said the rules would put more than 100 cab drivers out of work

However others said the new rules are only giving customers what they've asked for.

'The whole point is from the passenger’s perspective so that they can
 communicate with the driver, and get to where they need to go,' said Sacramento City Revenue Manager Brad Wasson.

Tests will be offered in an audio format for drivers who cannot read. 

'We want them to succeed,' Wasson said. 'And we want to bring them along so they can
 serve public better, and pass the test and thrive.'

City officials claim the regulations are a response to customer complaints

Any drivers who fail to comply can be reported to the city.

But Zadie still thinks the motives go beyond customer service.

'Why is the city causing trouble for our cab drivers?' he said. 'This is really discrimination.'
