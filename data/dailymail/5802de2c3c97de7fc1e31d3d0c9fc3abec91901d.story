Everything was as expected at the World Cup on Monday – Ireland defeated West Indies and are already well placed to reach the quarter-finals of a competition that is almost designed to stop the smaller teams progressing.

There was no surprise, no real sense of an upset about Ireland’s ability to chase down West Indies 304 for seven with 25 balls in hand in Nelson, just a grim realisation that a side with a proud cricketing heritage are in big trouble.

West Indies, racked by in-fighting, have been an accident waiting to happen at this World Cup and, in a strong and purposeful Ireland, they came up against the perfect team to take advantage of their vulnerability in their opening game.

This is the third time Ireland, crammed with experienced county cricketers, have defeated a ‘big’ team at a World Cup and can now add the scalp of West Indies to those of Pakistan in 2007 and, of course, England four years ago.

There is a sense of grievance in Irish cricket about their lack of games against Test nations, the decision of the International Cricket Council to reduce the next World Cup to 10 teams and England’s habit of poaching their players.

Well, this was the perfect way for them to show that they are deadly serious about their desire to not only play more one-day internationals but also to gain the full Test status that they crave.

And there were plenty of Irishman who were claiming that Eoin Morgan, the Dubliner now captaining England at this World Cup, would struggle to get in their side now anyway. And that was no Irish joke.

It looked as though Ireland might have blown their chance when they allowed West Indies to recover from the depths of 87 for five to reach a total that they should have been able to defend, however good the Saxton Oval pitch.

Yet it is fair to say that Ireland’s successful chase never really looked in doubt and would have been even more convincing had they not suffered a late stutter which saw them eventually lose six wickets in cantering home.

At the centre of what will go down as another significant day for Ireland were four players well known in England for their stature in the domestic game.

Firstly George Dockrell, the Somerset left-arm spinner, took three wickets before Lendl Simmons, with 102 from 84 balls, and Darren Sammy, who hit four sixes in his 89, rescued West Indies from complete embarrassment.

Then Paul Stirling, Ed Joyce and Niall O’Brien, all prolific county performers, showed a calmness and authority with the bat that West Indies and their rookie captain Jason Holder had no answer to.

Stirling, the hard-hitting Middlesex opener, led the way with 92 despite being struck on the helmet by Jerome Taylor before Sussex’s Joyce took control of the middle of the innings and Leicestershire’s O’Brien supplied the finish.

This was another triumph for Joyce who, at 36, is playing the best cricket of his career and could have achieved the ambition of playing Test cricket that led to him defecting to England had he stayed with his adopted country.

Instead the man who once scored a century for England against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground and played for them in the 2007 World Cup in the Caribbean has now set his sights on playing the ultimate game for his own nation. If he carries on like this you would not put it past him.

Conversely, these are grim times for West Indies. They still use the David Rudder’s ‘Rally Round the West Indies’ as their national anthem and never has that calypso anthem been more apt than in their current chaotic plight.

They arrived here without two of their best players in Dwayne Bravo and Keiron Pollard, banished for their leading roles in instigating strike action in India in October, and with poor Holder having to lead them at the age of just 23.

They were a rabble in a warm-up game against England last week which led to their manager Richie Richardson, one of the many great West Indian players let down by the current generation, saying they did not want to peak too early.

On this evidence they are not going to peak at all and face an early exit from this elongated tournament if they do not buck their ideas up quickly.

Goodness knows what West Indies team England will face in the Caribbean in April as their better players will prefer to cash in at the Indian Premier League at the same time, the perfect example of their modern day priorities.

‘It was a tough loss,’ said Holder, a promising fast bowler whose development can only be stifled by having to captain the side. ‘We backed ourselves to defend 304 but we leaked too many boundaries and couldn’t do it.’

A measure of Ireland’s ambition came in the matter of fact way they greeted victory. ‘It was great to get our first victory,’ said Stirling in expectation of gaining several more. ‘I owed the lads 90 after dropping Sammy on nought.’

William Porterfield, the Ireland captain, was equally sanguine when he said: ‘Hopefully this sets us up for the next few games and we are in a great position now. Our belief has been growing for a while now and we know what we’re capable of. We didn’t just feel we could win this game but others too.’

It is in many ways a great shame that Morgan and Boyd Rankin, who England still want in their set-up despite his chastening Ashes tour, do not play for their own country and Ireland are desperate to stop the drain of talent.

They are not impressed either that England’s bi-annual fixture against Ireland can only be fitted in this summer at Malahide on May 8, immediately after England’s tour of the Caribbean, effectively ruling out their main players.

Yet if they can carry on like this – and the ICC give them a fairer crack of the whip – then all Irish cricketers really could be encouraged to stay at home.
