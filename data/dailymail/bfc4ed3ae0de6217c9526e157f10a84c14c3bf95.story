A top Red Cross official has said it will take up to six months to get the Ebola outbreak under control as the hunt continues for a vaccine to the deadly disease.

Even that time frame will only be realistic if medics in West Africa ensure 'safe burials', 'good isolation' and 'good treatment', according to Red Cross secretary general Elhadj As Sy.

He warned a press conference many nations' workers are 'coming out and running away, and others [are] very hesitant to send people'.

Warning: It will take up to six months to get Ebola under control, but even that time frame will only be realistic if medics ensure 'safe burials', 'good isolation' and 'good treatment', according to a top Red Cross official

Hopes: The first shipment of the experimental vaccine VSE-EBOV, which arrived at a Geneva hospital today

Mr Sy was speaking in the Chinese capital Beijing at the Red Cross's Asia-Pacific conference, held every four years.

He told delegates the epidemic - whose death toll rose today to at least 4,877 people in West Africa since it emerged ten months ago - could be contained within four to six months.

There have now been 9,936 probable, suspected and confirmed cases of Ebola, mostly in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, with transmission in some areas remaining 'intense'.

World Health Organisation (WHO) figures suggest the real death toll is as high as 15,000.

Mr Sy also praised China for contributing relief items, laboratory equipment and protective gear to help in the fight against the deadly virus.

Two Ebola survivors with their medical certificates

Almost 50 Ebola survivors were discharged today from a treatment centre in Sierra Leone - proudly holding up certificates to show they were free of the disease.

One survivor, 14-year-old Hawanatu Turay, 14, said: 'Nothing hurts me anymore and I am feeling fine, I can do anything I want to do

'I am happy, I can eat fine, my stomach hurts no more, my head aches no more and also my neck, nothing hurts and I have no more pains.'

The 45 patients brought the total number of survivors released by the facility near the capital Freetown to 130.

But there were fierce clashes elsewhere in the West African country, which has had 1,259 Ebola deaths.

A curfew was imposed today in the eastern diamond-rich Kono district after protests which saw police fire tear gas to disperse crowds who had gathered with sticks and machetes.

They were supporting an opposition figure who wanted to stop health officials from taking blood samples from his mother. 

China's authorities, whose nation has substantial interests in African resources and infrastructure, have donated £3.7million to help stave off food shortages in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.

With the world's second-largest economy and a permanent seat on the U.N. Security Council, China is beginning to make larger contributions to international aid efforts.

China is Africa's largest trading partner.

'As some said it when I was in Sierra Leone and Guinea, it is only at this time that you know who your friends are, and definitely they see China as their friend,' Mr Sy added.

The comments came a day after the World Health Organisation said a breakthrough in the hunt for an Ebola vaccine could be just weeks away. 

Assistant director general Dr Marie-Paule Kieny said an experimental version could be ready for mass distribution in Africa early next year if current trials in Europe, Africa and the U.S. are successful. 

She said there are two leading candidates for a vaccine.

One of them is developed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and GlaxoSmithKline from a modified chimpanzee cold virus and an Ebola protein.

It is already being trialled in Britain and Mali and will also be trialled in Lausanne, Switzerland.

The second was developed by the Public Health Agency of Canada and known as VSV-EBOV.

It has already been sent to the U.S. Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Maryland for testing on healthy volunteers, with results expected by December.

The next stage would be to test it more broadly, including among those directly handling Ebola cases in West Africa.

Today the WHO's emergency committee on Ebola met for the third time since August to review the scope of the outbreak and whether additional measures are needed. 

The 20 independent experts have the power to recommend travel and trade restrictions, and have already recommended exit screening of passengers from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.

The organisation has also promised a full public audit of the agency's alleged slow response to the outbreak - by far the deadliest ever recorded.

The previous most deadly Ebola in 1976, the year the virus was discovered, killed 280 people in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

So far only two countries, Spain and the U.S., have had fresh infections outside West Africa. In both cases they arose after contact with patients who had been flown home for treatment.

Outside the three main countries, there were also 20 fresh cases of Ebola in Nigeria and one in Senegal - but both outbreaks have now been contained, the WHO said this week.

On Friday a British hospital ship with 100 beds set sail for Sierra Leone from Falmouth, Cornwall, after the crew spent a week loading medical supplies.

The 574ft RFA Argus has a full emergency department, resuscitation and surgical facilities, a radiology suite with a CT scanner, a critical care unit, a high dependency unit and a 70-bed general ward.

It will also be joined by 750 servicemen and three Merlin helicopters.

An experimental vaccine could be ready for distribution in Africa, including Freetown (pictured), by January

The European Commission has pledged almost £80million to developing an Ebola vaccine, it emerged today.

A private-public partnership will plough 200 million euros (£157million) into vaccines as well as drugs and diagnostic tests, two sources told the Reuters news agency today.

It is claimed the funding will be announced this week under the Innovative Medicines Initiative (IMI), a public-private scheme jointly paid for by the pharmaceuticals industry and the European Commission. 

Much of the money is likely to be used to help finance large-scale clinical trials of three experimental vaccines, the sources said.

Under the plan, the European Commission will contribute 100 million euros, with drug companies belonging to the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations contributing a similar amount in staff time, goods and services.
