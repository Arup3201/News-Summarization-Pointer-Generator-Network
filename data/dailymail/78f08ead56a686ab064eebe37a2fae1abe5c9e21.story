It's a world away from the Tottenham flat she was brought up in.

Singer Adele moved into this former country mansion in 2012, following the blockbuster worldwide success of her album '21', with her old Etonian boyfriend Simon Konecki.

The house, which she rented for £15,000 a month, has 10-bedrooms - including a master suite and six with ensuite bathrooms - as well as a games room, a three-bedroom 'staff flat' and a guest cottage set within the picturesque, 25-acre grounds.

The sprawling estate, which also boasts two swimming pools, a tennis court and a helicopter hanger, is now on the market for £6million.

The mansion in West Sussex was formerly rented by Grammy award-winning singer Adele and her old Etonian boyfriend Simon Konecki, who have a baby son

Tottenham-born Adele and her old Etonian boyfriend Simon Konecki moved to the property in Horsham - which is being sold by Strutt & Parker - in 2012.

They are thought to have moved out last year, having rented the mansion for an estimated £15,000 a month.

There are two snooker tables in the mansion, which is being marketed by estate agents Strutt & Parker, which has a network of offices in England and Scotland

The Grade II listed property is a world away from the south London flat above a shop, where the Grammy-winner lived with her mother.

An online sales blurb reads: 'In recent years the property has been extensively refurbished to provide a home of exceptional quality and comfort and extended to include a leisure complex with indoor swimming pool.

'Many of the Art Deco features from the 1930's have been retained, including built-in bedroom furniture and bathrooms.'

The singer dropped hints earlier this year that she is set to release her third album imminently.
