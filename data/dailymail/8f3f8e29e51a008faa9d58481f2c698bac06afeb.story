While one husband only left his wife a farthing because she called him a 'rotten old pig', another man bequeathed £26,000 to Jesus Christ - but only if He could prove His identity.

The bequests in these bizarre wills also include one from a father who wanted his step-daughter to receive the 'price of half a pound of pork sausages' after her late mother did not pay her for them.

The team at genealogy firm Fraser and Fraser - based in Farringdon, central London - have spent almost half a century compiling a list of the strangest requests they have discovered on wills.

Unusual: The strange wills include the 1888 document by boot and shoe manufacturer Albert Orton from Coventry, who left his wife one farthing after her 'rotten old pig' insult hurled at him because of his flatulence

'Rotten old pig: Mr Orton, who only left one farthing to his wife, was born in 1818 and died in 1888, aged 70

Bequest: Frank Smith, from Romsey, Hampshire, wrote in his will to leave all remaining possessions to his daughter if she did not continue living with her 'immoral husband' or allow him to benefit from the inheritance

Writing's on the will: Isaac Cooke from Surrey, who died in 1936, left everything to his wife, Alice. He wrote his entire will in a seven-verse rhyming poem. One section reads: 'To Alice Cooke my loving wife, for her to keep or use. Without reserve throughout her life, however she may choose'

During that time the experts have dug up scores of unusual passages written on the legal declarations - before whittling these down to a top ten, which have now been revealed.

Their discoveries include the 1888 will of boot and shoe manufacturer Albert Orton from Coventry, who left his wife one farthing after her 'rotten old pig' insult hurled at him because of his flatulence.

They also found a 'beautifully written' seven-versed poem and a will revealing how a man left money to Christ, as long as He could prove His identity.

In another will, 59-year-old Annie Langabeer wanted to give her brother-in-law two shillings and sixpence so he could 'buy a rope' because she wanted him to hang himself.

Employees at the firm have looked through a staggering 200,000 wills since the late 1960s trying to trace people's family trees.

They found one written in 2002 by Stephen Cuthbert, from Wiltshire, which included strict instructions that his estate paid for the 'p*** up' after his funeral. 

Money: The will of Kenneth Gibson, born in 1923 in Lincolnshire, who requested in 1999 that his step-daughter should get the 'price of half a pound of pork sausages that she claimed in my presence that her late mother Ann Cox had not paid her for'

Wide-ranging: Sir Charles Stewart Henry Vane Tempest Stewart, the 7th Marquess of Londonderry, wrote his 55-page will in 1945. He was one of the richest men in the country at the time and had everything covered. He not only wanted his wife to have all of his animals, but also 'the natural increase of animals' too

Romantic: Richard Walker wrote his will in 1981 and decided to leave the majority of his wealth, £10,000, to the 'love of his life', Miss Miss Gay Varasporn Suwanahong - who he met in a bar in Thailand. She could only receive the sum when she turned 21. Mr Walker, from Wolverhampton, died in Bangkok in 1982, aged 41

Staff at Fraser and Fraser also stumbled across the will of Frank Smith, from Romsey, Hampshire, who decided what to do with his £2,989 in December 1937.

He asked to leave all of his remaining possessions to his daughter as long as she did not continue living with her 'immoral husband'. Mr Smith, who died in November 1942, said the money should go to the Exchequer if she disobeyed his request.

Information from another will written in February 1999 found Kenneth Gibson, from Lincolnshire, included a peculiar request.

He said his stepdaughter must be given the 'price of half a pound of pork sausages' after her late mother, Ann Cox, did not pay her for them. He died two months later in April, aged 75.

The father's odd request was discovered by Neil Fraser, 39, a partner at Fraser and Fraser, while he was working on a case and trying to trace a family tree.

Hanging request: The will of Annie Langabeer, from Sutton, Surrey, who died aged 59 in 1932. She wrote that her brother in law, Daniel Jones, should be paid two shillings and sixpence to enable him to purchase a rope

Choice: The will of Martin Turner, from January 1916. He was in the British Army and had the original surname of Tuchmann, which was stated in all records. But he requested everyone should call him, his heir heirs and children by the surname Turner only

A drink to say goodbye: The will of Stephen Cuthbert, from Wiltshire, who wrote his will in 2002 with strict instructions that his estate paid for the 'p*** up' after his funeral

Long process: The team at genealogy firm Fraser and Fraser - including partner Neil Fraser (above) - have spent almost half a century compiling a list of the strangest requests they have discovered on wills

He said: ‘Most of them are fairly old. Usually when we find the hilarious passages, we are all just researching people's next of kin and we suddenly stumble across something unusual.

‘Anyone can access the wills and they take two weeks to arrive from the Principal Registry of the Family Division. You can even apply for the Queen Mother's will or Princess Diana's.

‘We have looked through around 200,000 wills since 1969 and it's quite hard to spot the unusual lines because they are typically just one paragraph in a five page document.

‘But every now and again you will stumble across a funny line, paragraph or strange request which makes us laugh in the office.’

Mr Fraser, of Highgate, north London, added: ‘We can choose to leave everything we own to a charity, a next door neighbour or we can even leave it to a dog. I think there is always a place for humour in a will.’

1. Annie Langabeer, from Sutton, Surrey, died in Epsom, aged 59 in 1932. She wrote in her will her brother in law, Daniel Jones, should be paid two shillings and sixpence to enable him to purchase a rope with the message 'though dead our spirits live'.

2. Isaac Cooke, from Surrey, wrote his will in 1935 and died in 1936. He left everything to his wife, Alice, and wrote his entire will in a seven-verse rhyming poem.

3. Frank Smith, from Romsey, Hampshire, had £2,989 and wrote his will in December 1937. He died in November 1942.

And if the daughter does not do this, everything will go to the Exchequer for the purposes of the state.

4. Albert Orton, 70, from Coventry, was born in 1818. He only left one farthing to his wife because he was disgusted at the treatment he received from her. The boot and shoe manufacturer said she called him a 'rotten old pig' because he broke wind. He died in 1888, aged 70.
