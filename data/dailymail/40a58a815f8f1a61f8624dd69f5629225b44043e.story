Most brides-to-be pick a cute niece or a friend's angelic daughter to scatter rose petals as she walks down the aisle at her wedding.

But Michigan bride  Laura VanPelt made a rather less traditional choice for her flower girl at her nuptials last weekend.

Instead of a rosy-cheeked cherub or a precocious little princess, Laura asked her 94-year-old grandma to take on the role.

Helen Kavanagh took her place alongside bridesmaids and groomsmen at the wedding ceremony held just outside Laura's parents' home near Rockford, Michigan Live reports. 

It was last Christmas when Laura informed her grandmother that she'd decided on a flower girl, and wondered if she would take on the role.

'When she asked me, I just laughed,' Helen said. 'I thought she was kidding, of course.

'But then she said: "No, grandma, I'm not. I want you to be my flower girl".' 

The grandma walked down the aisle carrying her cane - which was wrapped in lace for the occasion - in one hand and a basket full of flower petals strapped over her shoulder.

As one of 12 children, Mrs Kavanagh went on to have nine of her own with husband Lawrence, who died of cancer nearly 30 years ago. 

She now has 11 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren with another one on the way. 

Mrs Kavanagh, who has previously worked as a cake baker and decorator, combined her duties as flower girl with baking 200 truffles and several pans of dessert for her granddaughter's marriage to new husband Austin Kuipers.

'When I tell people I was the flower girl, it's quite a surprise,' she said, before adding that the moment was 'the biggest thrill' she's ever had.
