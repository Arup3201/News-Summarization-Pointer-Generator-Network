Bacary Sagna will hold talks with Manchester City after the FA Cup final later this month.

The Arsenal right-back is in the midst of a long-running contract wrangle with the club and looks almost certain to leave the Emirates Stadium this summer when his deal expires.

Sagna is free to discuss a move to a Barclays Premier League club at the end of the season, and his intention is to discuss a potential switch to the Etihad Stadium.

On the move: Bacary Sagna will hold talks with Manchester City after Arsenal's FA Cup final against Hull

Final hurdle: Sagna is set to bring his eight-year spell at Arsenal to an end with his contract due to expire

His advisors have already held talks with numerous overseas clubs including Paris St Germain, Galatasary and Inter Milan.

But transfer regulations forbid discussions with clubs in the same country until the end of the season.

Sagna wants to have all the options available to him before making a decision on his next move.

Slide: Sagna is yet to agree a new deal with Arsenal and has been targeted by a number of clubs 

Escape to the north: Sagna could be the latest Arsenal player to join City, like Samir Nasri

The club have made him a final offer of a three-year deal worth in the region of £80,000-per-week.

But the deal falls short of his £100,000-per-week demands, with sources close to the defender claiming he will reject the deal on the table.
