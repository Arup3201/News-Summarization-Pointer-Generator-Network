Convicted: Na Cola Franklin, 32, was found guilty by a jury in Allentown, Pennsylvania on Thursday

The mugshot of the bride-to-be who fatally stabbed her fiancé twice in the heart just hours before they were due to get married has been released two days after she killed her would-be husband.   

Na Cola Darcel Franklin, 31, appears dishevelled and her eyes were still red by the time she was photographed at the Whitehall Township police station in Pennsylvania following the attack.

She has been charged with criminal homicide after twice stabbing Billy Rafael Brewster, 36, after they began arguing in the early hours of Saturday morning, police report.  

Franklin allegedly attacked Brewster in the apartment they shared with three children in eastern Pennsylvania.

Police say they found Brewster bleeding from his chest shortly after 2am Saturday.

Lehigh Valley Live reports that Franklin was only stopped after her would-be cousin tackled her, knocked the blood-stained kitchen knife out of her hand and stopped her from stabbing her fiancé.

Brewster's cousin Nakia Kali and his wife Monique travelled to Whitehall Township from out of town for the wedding- which was scheduled for 10am Saturday morning- and were staying in the apartment that Brewster and Franklin shared with three children.

At the time of the attack, four children were in the apartment but their names, ages, and relationships to the couple remains undisclosed.

The Kalis were interviewed by police shortly after the authorities arrived at the scene around 2.19am.

Landing: After being stabbed twice in the chest, Brewster crawled to the second floor landing outside of the apartment he shared with Franklin and three children

The couple said that they were out with Brewster and all arrived back to the apartment shortly after midnight. A little while later, the Kalis went into a bedroom and heard an argument begin between Brewster and Franklin after Brewster said that he and Franklin were going to buy food for everyone.

When Mr Kali went to see what was going on, he got in between the fighting couple and tried to break up the argument. Mrs Kali only entered the fight when she heard someone scream 'knife'.

After seeing blood on the left side of Brewster's chest and her husband standing in between Brewster and the knife-wieldling Franklin, she 'instinctively tackled' the woman in order to stop her from hitting Mr Kali.

Once Mrs Kali had tackled Franklin, Mr Kali grabbed the knife from her hands and passed it off to a child, instructing the child to take the knife into the kitchen.

During the episode, an injured Brewster crawled to the outdoor landing, which is where police found him when they arrived on the scene.

He was transported to Lehigh Valley Hospital and was pronounced dead at 3.24am.

Family members and the pastor who was scheduled to perform the couple’s wedding at 10am on Saturday morning arrived at the second-floor apartment throughout Sunday.  

The Allentown Morning Call reports that at Franklin’s video arraignment Saturday, the 31-year-old wept and choked out, 'I did not kill him on purpose.'

Seemingly unable to comprehend the murder charge she faces, Franklin also pleaded to the judge, ‘you got to check again.’

The Morning Call reported that the suspect was rocking back and forth and wailing during the hearing. At one point she cried out, ‘I want my family back. I want to go home.’

Neighbour Steve Engel says the pastor who was supposed to perform the ceremony came to the apartment building after being unable to reach the couple, and a number of people who were apparently going to the wedding also showed up throughout the day.

Another horrified neighbour, who lives across the hall from the couple, told Lehigh Valley Live that she didn’t think the couple had ‘any issues.’

'I was really shocked. It made me sick to my stomach,' said Sara Arnold.

As the investigation continues, a motive for the killing and the type of knife used has not been disclosed.

Franklin is being held in the Lehigh County Prison without bail.
