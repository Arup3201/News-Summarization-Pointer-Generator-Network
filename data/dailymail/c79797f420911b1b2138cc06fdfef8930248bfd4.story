Ten hospital workers have been suspended after an elderly woman died days after she was found with 'unexplained and serious injuries' on the ward.

Tegwen Roderick, 88, was being treated at the Cwm Cynon Hospital in Mountain Ash, South Wales, when her injury was spotted.

She was transferred to the Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil, but died last week - six days after the injury was detected.

Investigation: Ten staff at the Cwm Cynon Hospital in Mountain Ash, South Wales, have been suspended after Tegwen Roderick, 88, died days after she was found with 'unexplained and serious injuries'

Four medical staff at the 128-bed Cwm Cynon Hospital were today helping police with a criminal investigation into the death, as workers were questioned over how Mrs Roderick was hurt.

Mrs Roderick lived with husband John, 89, in the small village of Abercanaid near Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales.

He was today being comforted by family at the smart terraced house in the village.'We won't be making any comment whatsoever,' said a family spokesman.

Neighbours said Mrs Roderick had been in 'failing health' over recent months but was regularly seen in the village before being admitted to hospital.

Her husband, who is also in poor health, was said to be 'devastated' by the tragedy.

One neighbour who didn't want to be named said: 'It's very sad, she was not seriously ill when she went into hospital and now this has happened to her.

'She was a lovely lady - everyone here is very sad about what has happened.'

Former mayor of Merthyr Tydfil Derek Games MBE paid tribute to Mrs Roderick who he had known for 60 years.

'Tegwen was a beautiful and gentle woman - everyone is shocked by what has happened.

'She was a schoolteacher many years ago and had suffered ill health over recent years.

'Tegwen and her husband John were devoted to each other - unfortunately they didn't have any children.

'They were a lovely couple and John was committed to her, looking after her when she became ill.

'I hadn't seen either of them for a few weeks but I will be going to see John now to pass on my sympathies.'

Mr Games, 80, who lives in a neighbouring street in Abercanaid, added: 'All we know is that she was injured in hospital and the police are investigating. It could have been a fall or something more serious.'

Cwm Taf University Health Board 
confirmed that five nightshift workers have been suspended, along with 
the five members of staff who took over the following morning as a 
'precautionary measure' following the incident on May 29.

Neither
 the hospital, nor South Wales Police would confirm if the staff members
 had been nurses, nor give any detail as to the nature of the Ms 
Roderick's injury.

'As part of routine patient care a patient at Ysbyty Cwm Cynon was identified as having an unexplained injury.

'As is always the case in such a situation, the Health Board initiated a multi-agency strategy meeting to be held to consider the circumstances. This took place the following day.

'Staff on duty at the time are in the process of being interviewed to assist the investigation and the family have been kept fully informed of the situation.

'The Health Board extends its heartfelt condolences to the family at this very sad and difficult time.'

Mr Roderick is being supported by the health board and is being kept 'fully informed' of the investigation.

A post mortem examination was due carried out yesterday to discover if she had died as a result of the injury she received in hospital.

A police spokesman said: 'South Wales Police is continuing its investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of 88 year-old Tegwen Roderick at Prince Charles Hospital, Merthyr Tydfil on Wednesday, 4th June 2014.

'A post mortem into her death is currently under way.

'Ms Roderick, from Merthyr Tydfil, was transferred to Prince Charles hospital from Ysbyty Cwm Cynon with serious injuries which are being treated as unexplained.

'At this stage there is no confirmed link between the injuries and her death.

'Four people are assisting officers with their enquiries.'
