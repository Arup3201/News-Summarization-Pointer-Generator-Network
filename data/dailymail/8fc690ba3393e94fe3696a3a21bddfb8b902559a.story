A newborn baby's life has been saved after doctors 'froze' his body for four whole days.

Edward Ives was born with just a five per cent chance of survival due to a condition that caused his rate to race twice as fast as normal.

But he has made an amazing recovery after doctors rapidly cooled down his little body.

Claire with her son Edward: He was on the brink of death are his heart started racing at over 300 beats per minute

Doctors cooled Edward's body from 37C to 33.3C

When Edward was born in August last year, he was diagnosed with a condition called Supraventricular Tachycardia. It caused his heart to race at over 300 beats per minute - compared to the usual 160 bpm.

This reduced blood flow to his vital organs and left Edward on the brink of death.

Then medics suggested they wrap Edward in a blanket filled with a cold gel and allow his temperature to drop from 37C to 33.3C.

His mother, Claire Ives, 29, said: 'It was horrible to see him lying there freezing in nothing but a nappy.

'He was heavily sedated so didn't move much, and he was cold to touch - it looked like he was dead.

'All I wanted to do was scoop him up and give him a warm cuddle. I just had to keep reminding myself that it was saving his life.'

The doctors at University College London Hospital cooled Edward for two days straight, allowing him to be brought up to a normal temperature when his heart beat slowed.

But when his heart began to race once more, doctors again had to cool the little boy down for two further days.

'It was even worse the second time,' said Mrs Ives.

'I thought he was out of the woods but then his heart went into a bad rhythm again. I remember asking the nurse if he was going to die and she told me that he might.

'We just had to live minute by minute; we couldn't look ahead because we didn't know what the future held.'

Out of the woods: Although Edward could have further heart-racing episodes they are likely to be harmless

Mrs Ives first became suspicious that something was wrong when she was 35 weeks pregnant.

'I had one of those things where you could listen to your baby's heartbeat. I did it one evening and noticed that his heart was beating really fast.

Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a heart condition featuring episodes of an abnormally fast heart rate. It often emerges during childhood.

The heart will suddenly start racing, then stop or slow down abruptly. Episodes can last from seconds to days in rare cases. They may occur regularly, several times a day, or infrequently, once or twice a year.

The heart rate may be as high as 250 beats per minute, but is usually between 140 and 180 (a normal adult heartbeat should be 60-100 beats per minute at rest).

It's caused by abnormal electrical impulses that start suddenly in the 
upper chambers of the heart, upsetting the organ's natural rhythm.

It causes the heart muscle to contract so fast that it can't relax between contractions. This reduces the amount of blood being pumped 
around the body, which can cause dizziness and shortness of breath.

Episodes often happen for no obvious reason. However, they may be triggered by a 
change in posture, exertion, emotional upset, coffee or alcohol.

In the vast majority of cases, attacks of SVT are harmless, do not last long andÂ settle on their own without treatment.

'I'm a nurse, so I knew it wasn't right, but I thought maybe the machine had been wrong, so I went for a lie down for a bit and then tried again.

'It was normal the next time but I was still worried, so I called the Lister Hospital.

'I was being scanned and all of a sudden the sonographer went off and came back with lots of senior members of staff.

'Before I knew where I was they'd told me that my baby was really poorly, and that I should ring my husband because they needed to deliver straight away.

'They told me there was a very high chance that he'd die. All I could think of was how I was going to tell my other children, Joscelyn and Hayden - they'd been so excited to have a baby brother.

'The doctors were all ready to give me a caesarean section when at the last minute they'd been told by doctors at Great Ormond Street to give me a medication that could slow the baby's heart beat.'

Mrs Ives was on the medication for two days before being referred to Great Ormond Street.

'When we got to Great Ormond I went for another scan and then they took us into a room to explain what was going on.

'As soon as my husband Phillip and I walked into the room we saw a box of tissues on a side table. We knew then it wasn't going to be good news.'

Doctors explained to the couple that 
the cause of Edward's SVT was unknown, and the best thing to do would be
to deliver and treat him directly.

Mrs Ives was transferred to University College London Hospital where Edward was delivered.

'It was three hours before I got to see him and he was hooked up to so many machines. It was just awful,' she said.

'Then
later that night doctors came up to tell me that he was in a really bad
way, and all they could do was try and shock his heart, and then cool 
him down.'

Doctors decided to cool Edward in order to slow his heart rate down and ensure his organs would not be deprived of oxygen.

In total Edward spent four days wrapped in a blanket that lowered his body temperature, whilst also being shocked five times with a defibrillator, which is an electric current directed into his heart.

It was on the evening of the fourth day of cooling that Edward's heart rate finally returned to normal.

'I couldn't believe it, I was absolutely overjoyed' said Mrs Ives.

'I wanted to be cautious, because I was aware that he could go into an abnormal rhythm again, but it was amazing.'

Medics then began to warm Edward's body by half a degree every 12 hours, and the youngster slowly began to improve.

'As soon as his heart started beating normally everything began to improve. He'd been really puffy because his kidneys weren't working, but all of a sudden he looked like a normal baby again.'

A month later, after being referred back to The Lister Hospital, Edward was finally allowed to return home to his family.

'When I walked through my front door with Edward in his arms, it felt like a dream come true.

'There had been so many times when we thought he'd never come home. It's just been wonderful.'

Six-month-old Edward is now a healthy and happy baby, back at home with his family.

SVT is caused by abnormal electrical impulses that start suddenly in the
upper chambers of the heart. They may be triggered by exertion or stress.

Although it is possible Edward may have further heart-racing episodes, they will most likely be harmless and not last long.
