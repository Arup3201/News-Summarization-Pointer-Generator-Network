The
widow of an Army bomb disposal expert killed in Afghanistan is being 
forced to sell his bravery medals to help provide for the four children 
he left behind.

Gary 
O’Donnell became the first serviceman in nearly 30 years to be awarded 
the George Medal twice after saving countless lives in Iraq and 
Afghanistan.

But in 
September 2008, before the announcement of his second award was made, 
the 40-year-old was blown up when a booby-trapped device exploded as he 
tried to clear a path for his comrades.

Bravery: Gary O'Donnell won his medals for his exceptional bravery as he defused Taliban bombs, his widow Toni has now taken the equally courageous decision to sell his medals to provide for their children

Warrant Officer O’Donnell left wife 
Toni and four children – teenagers Cayleigh and Dylan from a former 
marriage and Toni’s children Aidan and Ben, who was just eight weeks old
when his father died.

Now Mrs O’Donnell, 44, has made the difficult decision to sell the unique set of awards.

The
heroism of bomb disposal experts such as Warrant Officer O’Donnell was 
captured in the Oscar-winning film The Hurt Locker. His medals are 
expected to fetch £60,000.

Pierce
Noonan, of auctioneers Dix Noonan Webb, said: ‘Her reasons for selling 
the medals are simply that she has a young family to provide for.

‘It has been an extremely difficult 
decision for her but because the value of them is between £50,000 and 
£60,000 the money is more useful to her and her family now.

'The medals are unique as they are the only George Medal and Bar to be awarded to a servicemen in the modern era.’

Warrant
Officer O’Donnell’s first honour came in 2006 for ‘persistent courage’ 
in Iraq and the second award was made for two incidents in Afghanistan.

In
May 2008 he worked nine hours to defuse eight devices in 40°C heat and 
in July he spent 24 hours defusing 11 Taliban bombs, one of which was 
triggered as he approached it but failed to go off.

Unique: WO O'Donnell's outstanding medal collection is hoped to raise around £60,000 for his family and is expected to attract the interest of collectors and museums worldwide

His death came just a few weeks later.

Mrs
O’Connell, of Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, told the Mail in 2011: 
‘Gary lived for the Army. I wouldn’t have changed what he did because it
made him who he was. I’m so proud of him.’

When
the posthumous award was made in 2009, Lieutenant General Sir Graeme 
Lamb said Warrant Officer O’Donnell was ‘brave as a lion’.

He said 'Gary O’Donnell was extremely brave 
but what you have to bear in mind with bomb disposal experts is that it 
is pre-meditated bravery, not on the spur of the moment.

'It must be a long and lonely walk for these people to make knowing that it could be the last thing they do.'

WO
O’Donnell, from Edinburgh, was part of the Royal Logistics Corps’ elite
bomb disposal unit and served in Sierra Leone before going to Iraq in 
2006.

He won his first 
George Medal - the second highest award for gallantry not in the face of
the enemy - for his persistent courage in defusing numerous bombs.

Warrant Officer Gary O'Donnell had an astonishingly successful career as an army bomb disposal expert prior to his death in Afghanistan in September 2008

One of the heroic acts was disabling a 
live rocket that was set to a timing device and aimed at the British 
base at Basra which housed 4,000

WO
O’Donnell had defused about 50 Improvised Explosive Devices (IED) 
during two tours of Afghanistan before he was killed in September 2008.

While
making safe one of the bombs, he came within milliseconds of being 
killed when he jammed his fingers into a crude clothes peg trigger just 
as it slammed shut.

The
citation for his second George Medal – the second highest award for 
gallantry not in the face of the enemy – stated that Warrant Officer 
O’Donnell was flown into a convoy after its bomb disposal operator 
collapsed exhausted.

It 
read: ‘The convoy was stationary and vulnerable. Without hesitation 
O’Donnell deployed to the scene of an IED and rendered it safe.

‘Over the next 24 hours, under increasing pressure and immense fatigue, he rendered safe a total of 11 IEDs.

'His calm and pragmatic approach to the task had belied the immense personal danger he repeatedly placed himself in.’

Mrs
O’Connell said at the time of the award of the second George Medal: 'I 
am so proud of him. He loved his job. He did what had to be done.'

Mr Noonan added: 'His medals will appeal to both collectors and museums alike. It is an opportunity to aquire a modern group of medals that are of national importance.'

The medal set includes the George Medal and Bar, General Service Medal Northern Ireland, Operational Service Medal Sierra Leone, Iraq Medal 2003, Operational Service Medal Afghanistan, NATO Medal, ISAF Medal , Jubilee 2002 Medal , Accumulated Campaign Service Medal and the Regular Army Medal.

They are being sold along with three letters on Buckingham Palace headed paper from Princess Anne, the colonel in chief of the Royal Logistic Corps.

The auction takes place on September 20 in London.
