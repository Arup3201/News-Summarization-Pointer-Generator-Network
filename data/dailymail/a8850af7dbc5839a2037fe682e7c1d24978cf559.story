An elderly woman has been left with heavy bruising after being punched in the face by another resident at her care home on Christmas day.

Heather Smith, from Leicester, was struck by a 74-year-old man in an unprovoked attack while walking along a corridor at Alston House, Leicester early on Christmas morning.

Mrs Smith, who is 83 and described as 'very frail and vulnerable', said she no longer feels safe at the care home and claims she had previously reported her attacker for pestering her.

Battered and bruised: Heather Smith was attacked while walking along a corridor on Christmas morning. The 83-year-old says she no longer feels safe at Alston House care home

Mrs Smith's daughter Ruth Lawrence, 44, said: 'I could not believe it when I saw the injuries my mum sustained... I am disgusted this man was allowed to attack my mother'.

She added: 'My mum does not feel safe there anymore and I am looking at bringing her home to live with me... It is a real shame because Mum was quite happy there.'

Mrs Smith said she does not remember much about the incident, but recalls a flashing sensation followed by severe pain as she hit the floor.

Alston House care home caters for 19 elderly people, many of whom suffer from dementia or other mental health conditions.

'Frail and vulnerable' Heather Smith may end up moving into her daughter's flat following the attack

A spokeswoman for Magnum Care Limited, which owns the home, refused to comment on the incident.

Ms Lawrence said: 'I cannot understand why there were no members of staff present. They know the man who attacked my mum has mental health issues.'

Describing how the attack ruined Christmas day for all concerned, Ms Lawrence said: 'I was about to make my way over to the 
home and collect mum and have her stay at mine for a few days over the 
Christmas period, but before I left the house, I received the dreaded 
news that my mum had been a victim of this man.'

She added: 'The most frustrating thing is that mum 
had told me that this guy had been pestering her and I’d told the 
managers at the home who should have been monitoring the situation'.

A police spokeswoman said: 'Officers were called to an address in Aylestone Road at 7.10am on Wednesday following reports that an elderly female had been assaulted.

'A 74-year-old man has been spoken to in connection with the incident.'

Ms Lawrence says she is hoping to remove her mother from the care home at the earliest opportunity and plans to move her into her own one bedroom flat.

She said: 'My mum will have to have my bed and I’ll sleep on the sofa, because I just can’t risk leaving her in there any longer.'
