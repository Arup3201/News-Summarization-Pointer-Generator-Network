Ruben Loftus-Cheek is all set to be handed his Chelsea debut on Wednesday night during their dead-rubber against Sporting Lisbon. 

The 18-year-old has yet to feature for the Blues but manager Jose Mourinho confirmed that he will be given a chance in the Champions League. 

'I am so happy to give the kids a chance. He is an English player, 18, completely made in Chelsea. If he succeeds it's good,' Mourinho said.

'It depends on the talent you have. I think every manager in the world wants to bring young people up. Sometimes you have it. Sometimes you don't.

'I can for example compare my first spell here and now, and now the quality of the young players is better. Clearly better. I'm not saying they're ready, or that they don't need a transitional period with us or a couple of loans, but the quality is much better. I have conditions to do it. 

'Go to other clubs, it's clear to see it's not easy to bring kids from the youth competitions to the top level, but I think every one of us has the same feeling. We want to do it.' 

The Chelsea manager has hailed the match against Sporting Lisbon as their 'Academy Day' and believes that he finally feels the club have the quality of youngsters to have a real chance of breaking through.

'The people in the academy feel they are working for something,' Mourinho said. 'Which is why on Wednesday, another boy and a boy who arrived at Cobham at eight, is not Ruben's day but 'Academy Day'.'

Mourinho suggested they may as well shut their academy and spend the money on buying players if they failed to bring anyone through.

'If you don't bring kids through the academy, the best thing is to close the academy.' he added. 'If the kids are not good enough or the work not good enough, and you don't bring kids up, then close the door and use the money to buy players.

'You need to prove the academy works well and is worth it. It's only possible if the first-team manager stays for a long time, which in this club in the last 10 years, was not possible. Now I'm trying to format Ruben and other Rubens in relation to my ideas, to his position.

'Imagine next week if there's a different first-team manager with different ideas. Some product, almost an added product, becomes an empty product and you start everything again. In this moment, the relation between the first-team and the academy is changing based on this stability that, at this moment, we are having.

'The first time Ruben trained with me was 18 months ago. In this moment, in the last two or three weeks, he's been training every day. So, in 18 months, I think he remembers every word or feedback he's had in first-team development. This stability is important.'

The striker was challenged by his manager to get in better shape to end his barren running after their defeat by Newcastle at the weekend, having only scored twice in the past seven matches.

There is little to play for in the game for Chelsea, but Sporting know they will also qualify if they win the match and will put out a full-strength side.

If Sporting lose and Schalke beat Maribor in the other Group G match, the German side will go through instead.

John Terry, Eden Hazard and Willian were noticeable absentees from Chelsea's training session ahead of playing Sporting.

The trio are set to miss out and Mourinho is set to field a much-changed side withChelsea already qualified for the next round of the tournament as winners of their group.

Youngsters Nathan Ake, 19, Loftus-Cheek, 18, and Mitchell Beeney, 19, were all out for the 11.30am session at Chelsea's Cobham training ground.

Midfielder Ake has been around the fringes of the first team this season and has started twice in the Capital One Cup and came on once in the Champions League.

Beeney, a goalkeeper, and midfielder Loftus-Cheek have not yet featured for the first team, although Loftus-Cheek has been captain of the youth team.

Diego Costa was also involved in the training session – dressed in neon yellow training tops and navy trousers – and will start at Stamford Bridge.

Ruben Loftus-Cheek, who is set to be handed his Chelsea debut against Sporting Lisbon on Wednesday night, is regarded as one of the country's brightest emerging talents.

The 6ft 4in central midfielder, 18, has earned rave reviews for his composed play and passing in central midfield and looks well-equipped to make the step up.

Hailing from Lewisham, south London, Loftus-Cheek first pulled on a blue shirt for the U8s team and is, as Jose Mourinho said, very much 'Made in Chelsea.'

Graduating through the Stamford Bridge schoolboy teams, he was appearing for the Under-18s three years ahead of schedule and captaining England schoolboys in the Victory Shield.

The maturity and energy he demonstrated in the box-to-box midfield role won admiring glances from a number of big clubs, including Barcelona, and prompted Chelsea to tie down his future

Loftus-Cheek is always a willing outlet for the defenders and, with head up pressing forward, is adept at picking the right pass.

Tall and strong, he is rarely dispossessed either, but it is his composure on the ball that is most eye-catching. He never looks rushed and always seems to be in acres of space.

The breakthrough season came in 2012-2013, when Loftus-Cheek played a starring role as Chelsea progressed to the final of the FA Youth Cup and the NextGen Series, though both ended in defeat.

Selection for the Under 21 side soon followed and he started two post-season first team friendlies against Manchester City out in the United States.

Loftus-Cheek helped Chelsea to victory in the Under 21 Premier League, playing in the 2-1 win in the final at Old Trafford. He also played a full part in Chelsea's FA Youth Cup success, captaining the team.

This season, he has been a mainstay of Chelsea's Under 21 side and has also participated in the UEFA Youth League.

Loftus-Cheek has been capped for England up to Under 19 level and has six goals in 10 matches at that standard.
