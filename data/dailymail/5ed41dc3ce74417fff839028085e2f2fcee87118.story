A teenager died on her way to school yesterday morning after being hit by a lorry near a pedestrian crossing on a busy south London road.

Police spent several hours attempting to track down the 13-year-old schoolgirl's parents after she was struck by a lorry on the South Circular road in Catford, south London, shortly after 7.30am.

The girl is believed to be a foreign exchange student after she was heard speaking French and a post-mortem examination will take place this afternoon.

Flowers have been left in tribute to the girl who was hit close to the zebra crossing in south London today

The crash happened just metres from a pedestrian crossing on Brownhill Road, near the junction with Stainton Road.

Residents have said it is the second fatal collision near to the crossing after an elderly woman was killed earlier this year.

Witnesses have described hearing a loud bang and several schoolchildren around at the time.

John Lowe, 34, told the News Shopper: 'I heard a really loud bang, I rushed out and there was a girl lying on the floor and her pencil case and schoolbag were on the floor.'

'That crossing is really dangerous.'

The father-of-three also said that he tried to call emergency services but they were already on their way.

Bobby Spencer, who lives nearby, said he heard a bang: 'I'm not sure if she was on the zebra crossing or not. Schoolkids were crowding round, looking scared.

Officers are still trying to trace the girl's parents

'There were a lot of people standing around. No one was doing anything for this poor girl.'

He said that the road where the accident took place has seen many incidents and is 'lethal'.

'There was a motorcyclist killed here and a dog was run over - I think there have been three or four accidents in the past year.

'It has got to change, it's so dangerous.

'This is the main road between Kent and London, so it's always chaos in the mornings.

'Loads of kids use it to get to school'.

Davina Pitt, who lives on the same road, said: 'It was awful, there were loads of kids around.

'From what I understand she was walking with her friends in a group.

'I heard the poor girl might have been French speaking - some kind of exchange student.

'It really makes me worry about my son going to school alone.'

She added: 'This road is so busy and as a mum you dread getting one of those awful phone calls.

'It means loads of kids use the bus stop, but there's only the zebra crossing and no others for miles.

'They should really do something, install some more pedestrian lights.'

It is thought she may have been on her way to one of two local schools in the area, Sandhurst or Torridon.

Residents have laid flowers at the scene including Jodie Painter who looked shaken and red-eyed.

She said: 'The poor angel was the same age as my daughter. I saw the lorry there this morning, I don't want talk about the details, it's too horrible.'

She added: 'There have been so many accidents here, it's still not safe.

'I'm starting a petition to make the road safer because I really worry about my daughter and all the other poor kids. I'm trying to do something about it.

'I've only lived here four months and I've seen three or four accidents.

'It's disgraceful. I just feel so sorry for her poor family.'

Police and ambulance staff were called to a collision on the South Circular road in Catford, south east London

Metropolitan Police have said that the 39-year-old lorry driver, who stopped at the scene, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. He has been bailed until October 17 pending further inquiries.

Officers advised motorists to avoid the Catford area of the A205 as the road was closed in both directions between the Catford Gyratory and Verdant Lane while the investigation was carried out.

Any witnesses or anyone with any information are asked to call the witness lines on 020 8285 1574.
