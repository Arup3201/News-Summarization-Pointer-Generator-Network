O'Brien outside Minshull Street Crown Court today before he was sentenced to eight years in jail

An undertaker has been jailed for misleading grieving clients and pocketing funeral charity donations to help balance the books of his struggling business.

Michael O'Brien, 59, admitted keeping around 
£1,500 in donations while in charge at Murray's Funeral Directors in 
Dukinfield, Greater Manchester.

Minshull Street Crown Court heard how he took advantage of a series of vulnerable 
clients even though he knew that his family business was struggling and later went bankrupt.

O'Brien has now been jailed for eight months after he admitted fraud and offences under unfair trading regulations.

The donations that he took had been left in envelopes which also contained cards with heart-felt messages of support, which he also failed to pass on to grieving families.

The scale of his deceit 
unravelled when police were called and discovered a series of diligent 
notes written by O'Brien, detailing donations which hadn't been passed on.

It
 was found O'Brien had kept £800 intended for British Heart Foundation, 
£495 for MacMillan Cancer Support and £190 for Tameside General 
Hospital.

Human ashes were also seized as police raided the premises in October last year.

O'Brien,
 59, of Hyde, pleaded guilty to three counts
 of fraud by false representation between January 2010 and February 2013
 at Tameside Magistrates Court in March.

O'Brien, of Woolley Lane, Hollingworth, had also mis-sold a series of funeral plans to elderly people worth a total of £10,219.

Those who did not want to burden surviving relatives had paid him up to £3,000 for their funerals.

But the court heard none of the plans was backed by insurance and O'Brien had not been regulated as required by the Financial Conduct Authority.

It meant that families didn't realise they risked losing their money if, as later happened, his business went bankrupt.

Although O'Brien never failed to provide a funeral, the money he took for funeral plans went into propping up his failing business rather than into holding accounts for his customers.

Sentencing him, Judge Andrew Lowcock told O'Brien: 'It's very sad to see you in the dock of the crown court. You had, prior to these events, led a blameless life.

'Your offences were committed against people at their most vulnerable, whether through illness, age or bereavement.

'Trying to support your business was not an excuse.'

Earlier, Simeon Evans, defending, said: 'He would say he's a very good undertaker and a very, very bad businessman.'

Police and council officials also removed documents during the investigation last year, which was triggered by a string of complaints. O'Brien has been sentenced to eight months in prison

After the sentencing hearing, Francis Hancock's grieving family, who paid £1,080 to Michael O'Brien for a headstone, told how they finally had justice.

Retired builder Mr Hancock, a father-of-four with seven grandchildren, died aged 64 of cancer and O'Brien arranged the funeral.

It went well and the family, from Ashton-under-Lyne, went to O'Brien again for the headstone.

Francis' daughter Fiona Smith, 39, confronted the undertaker after a series of delays and later learned he had gone bankrupt.

They also realised he had pocketed donations for Macmillan Cancer Care.

After watching him being jailed, Fiona said: 'We trusted him completely. This was justice for dad really, not for us. It was his money. He would have been fuming.'
