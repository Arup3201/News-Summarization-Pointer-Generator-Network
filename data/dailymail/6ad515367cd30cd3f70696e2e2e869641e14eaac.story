Unite's Len McCluskey who told comrades they must 'consider the incredible offer' made by state-owned Bank of China for the Grade II listed property

Labour's union paymasters have held talks to sell a historic mansion to communist China for an ‘incredible’ £21 million – more than three times the asking price.

Left-wing Unite, which gives £3.5 million a year to Ed Miliband’s party, owns Esher Place in Surrey.

Set in eight acres of grounds and once visited by Edward VII, the grand country house lies on the site of a building where Sir Francis Drake’s family lived.

An earlier building on the site was owned by the Church and Cardinal Wolsey was kept under house arrest in its gatehouse after falling out with Henry VIII.

Britain’s biggest trade union uses the mansion’s ornate rooms for conferences and training and Labour leader Miliband has visited it on a party away-day.

But although Unite thinks the Grade II listed property is worth only £6.5 million, and is running it at a loss, the state-controlled Bank of China has offered three times over the odds, raising questions as to the deal between them.

Secret papers seen by The Mail on Sunday reveal staff of the world’s fifth-biggest financial institution have visited Esher Place a dozen times and made a series of increasingly generous offers to buy it.

The move would improve Unite’s accounts and also give the Chinese an impressive base as they expand their investments in the UK.

‘Red’ Len McCluskey, the hardliner who runs the union behind some of the country’s most disruptive strikes, told comrades at last month’s policy conference in Liverpool that they must consider the ‘incredible’ offer to ease their financial pressures.

But delegates warned it would be ‘ludicrous’ to sell Unite’s ‘jewel in the crown’, and have raised questions about their leaders’ links with Communist China.

The final decision had been due to be  taken in a vote by the union’s ruling Executive Council next month but last night the Bank of China claimed it had pulled out of the deal.

Ed Sabisky, Unite’s executive director of finance, pensions and property, wrote in a recent letter to ‘address the queries, issues and concerns’ raised about the proposed sale that ‘the Bank of China’s extraordinary offer’ is far higher than any others received.

He said Unite’s ‘financial situation remains tight’ and added: ‘If the union sold Esher Place to Bank of China for £21 million it would have more financial flexibility to meet the challenges of the coming years without having to increase member subscriptions beyond that otherwise deemed reasonable or to cut front-line services to members.

‘Unite’s communications department has analysed the situation and cannot see any negative connotations for Unite by selling Esher Place to what is effectively the state of China (although doubtless we would be attacked by the Right-wing press because they attack us for everything we do).’

Critics said the sale’s boost to union coffers would increase Unite’s control over Labour and Mr Miliband, who has unsuccessfully tried to limit the power of the union barons who helped him become party leader.

It comes after The Mail on Sunday revealed that Unite chief of staff Andrew Murray, representing the Communist Party of Britain, spoke at a rally in support of pro-Russian separatists fighting in Ukraine.

David Morris, Conservative MP for Morecambe and Lunesdale, said last night: ‘What a tidy food chain! Communist China swelling the  coffers of militant Len McCluskey, which will give him even more power over weak Ed Miliband.

‘The unions are already almost  single-handedly funding Labour and practically writing their policies. It will only get worse now.’

A union insider said: ‘Why are the Chinese offering so much money, that’s the big question that’s being asked. The union isn’t short of cash but all of a sudden there appears to be a big rush to sell this place.’

Esher Place’s latest valuation is £6.5 million but the Bank of China has made six offers this year, topping £21 million, as well as promising to let Unite use the facilities until 2016.

Bank of China is a commercial bank with a branch in the City of London, but is wholly owned and controlled by the Chinese state. Chinese banks and firms have invested billions in British industry, taking stakes in nuclear power stations and airports as well as companies such as drinks giant Diageo.

A Unite spokesman claimed last night: ‘There is no offer from the Bank of China or anyone else.’

A spokesman for Bank of China’s property adviser CBRE said: ‘The bank will not be buying Unite’s property under any circumstances.’
