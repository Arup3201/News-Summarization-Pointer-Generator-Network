Britain's biggest high-street stores have been accused of preying on vulnerable families by encouraging customers to gamble on their online shopping.

Boots, Sainsbury's and Asda are among the 150 well-known retailers that offered their internet  customers the chance to win their shopping by placing a £1 stake on the spin of a roulette wheel.

Shoppers using the stores' own websites to buy everyday items are told they have an 'unbeatable way to win anything you want'.

But last night MPs and anti- gambling charities condemned the stores for introducing gambling into the home as an everyday activity – and said families already  facing economic hardship risked losing hundreds of pounds while doing their shopping.

To take part, customers open an online account with a gaming company. This allows them to browse through the stores' catalogues. When they find an item they want, they can choose to 'play' or 'shop'.

If they click on 'play', £1 is deducted from their account and a roulette wheel pops up. If it lands on red, the user has won the item.

If they don't win, they are not required to buy the product. But they are encouraged by various incentives, including discounts on future purchases and up to 25 'free plays', to spin the wheel again.

High Street giant Boots said it has suspended its account with Yipiii pending further investigation

The scheme is operated by Yipiii Gaming, a Maltese gambling business, unregulated by British watchdogs.

Hours
after The Mail on Sunday started raising ethical questions about the 
scheme, several stores began withdrawing from it, apparently concerned 
over the damage it might do to their reputations.

Yipiii says that the odds of winning vary according to a complex mathematical formula, but that 85p in every £1 spent is returned to prizewinners, with the remaining 15p used to cover profit and costs.

The site lures customers with promises of 'free' goods worth up to £30,000 and a pledge that 'with Yipiii, you never lose'.

A tool has also been developed that makes the Yipiii roulette wheel appear each time someone logs on to one of the participating retailers' websites.

But although customers were able to play the game directly on the stores' own sites, many of retailers told The Mail on Sunday they were not aware of it, and blamed third-party operators who link between websites to attract  more customers.

Marks and Spencer, Asda, Debenhams, Comet, Sainsbury's, Boots,  Dixons and Selfridges last night said they were in the process of withdrawing from the scheme.

Business Secretary Vince Cable  said he was 'disturbed' to hear of the scheme, saying: 'Gambling is quite rightly highly regulated because of the damage it can cause and it's clearly unacceptable to blur the boundaries between gambling and retail shopping. I am pleased to hear that responsible retailers are moving away from this.'

Business Secretary Vince Cable said the scheme was 'disturbing'

Conservative MP James Gray said he felt 'very uneasy' about the scheme, adding: 'Online gambling is a terrible evil and if store websites are encouraging people to gamble, I strongly oppose it.

'If the majority of stores are withdrawing their names from the scheme it sounds very questionable.'

Mike Judge, of the Christian Institute, added: 'These companies have behaved in an irresponsible and  deplorable way. Schemes like this are  particularly dangerous for people on low incomes because they feel they can get out of their financial difficulties by gambling. But the result is often wrecked families and wrecked lives.'

Yipiii founder Chistoph Klingler, an Austrian businessman, told The Mail on Sunday he thought his scheme would work well in this country because the British are 'confident' with online shopping and 'love a flutter'.

His company is run from an office in the Maltese capital, Valletta, and is not subject to UK regulation or supervision. It is licensed by only one body, the Lotteries and Gaming Authority of Malta, and, as a foreign firm, does  not have to register with Britain's Gambling Commission – although  proposals to close that loophole were announced in the Queen's Speech.

A Gambling Commission spokesman confirmed: 'You do not need a licence from us to run a remote gambling service if all of your remote gambling equipment is located outside Britain.'

Psychologist Kim Stephenson, who has written a book on the psychology of saving and spending, said: 'Over time, you cannot win. All you can be certain of is that you will get less back than you paid in. That is the essence of the bet.

'Sites such as these promote the idea that gambling is acceptable and that the expectation of getting something for nothing is a normal way of life.'

Yipiii users are encouraged to keep gambling by a variety of incentives, including the promise of discounts on future purchases and special offers  of free spins of the roulette wheel. Another ruse to keep customers on the site as long as possible is to compensate for a failed bet by offering free entry to online competitions.

Shoppers are automatically logged off 
after an hour as a safeguard against overspending, though there is 
nothing to stop them logging on again straight away.

The
Yipiii website says players must be 18 or over but customers are 
required only to tick a box confirming their age. If they win a prize, 
however, they are asked to send  a photocopy of their passport or 
driving licence to obtain the item.

Players can top up their account by up to £50 a time, up to £200 day.

British retailers have become 
increasingly keen on using affiliate websites, such as Yipiii, to 
attract new customers. An industry source explained: 'There are salesmen
out there whose job is to target fledgling websites and link them up to
established brands. Either Yipiii did not disclose that it was a gaming
site or the stores did not bother to check.'

When
a Mail on Sunday reporter visited Yipiii's registered address – a 
first-floor office just off Freedom Square in the centre of Valletta –  
the receptionist said she had never heard of the company but would make 
inquiries through another firm, called Evolve.

A
man who claimed to represent Evolve then told our reporter to leave the
building, saying: 'OK, enough now. Can you leave? It's  private 
property.'

Last night Mr 
Klingler admitted he had never struck any deals directly with the 
British stores, despite describing them on his website as 'trusted 
partners'.

He said: 'Yipiii is here to benefit British consumers, not mislead them in any way.

'We
are incredibly transparent about our model and we believe it is the 
first of its kind. We have all sorts of processes in place that ensure 
people cannot use the site irresponsibly. For example, there are maximum
amounts that they can credit to their account at any one time and 
alerts if they have been on the site for a specific period of time.'

Mr
Klingler said the decision to base the business in Malta had  nothing 
to do with reducing tax  liability but because 'the process  for setting
up a licensed gaming business is much faster there' – and regulators 
were 'genuinely interested' in licensing his business.  Last night 
several retailers said they were launching their own inquiries following
The Mail on  Sunday's investigation.

Marks and Spencer said: 'M&S has taken action to withdraw from the Yipiii service.'

Asda said: 'Having reviewed the nature of the site we have taken  the decision to remove it from our affiliate programme'.

Debenhams said: 'Once we were made aware of how this affiliate operated, we ended the arrangement.'

Comet said: 'Our legal team is  contacting the administrator [of the Yipiii website] to request our logo is removed.'

Sainsbury's said: 'We have asked that our name is removed immediately.'

Boots said: 'We have suspended the account with Yipiii pending further investigation.'

Selfridges
said: 'We closely monitor the internet for inappropriate brand 
associations such as gambling sites and take action when required.'

B&Q said: 'We are looking into this.'

An earlier version of this article said Mail on Sunday reporters had spent £162 on Yipiii plays but won only a £20 toy goldfish bowl.

In fact, one reporter used ‘free plays’ acquired during the experiment and went on to win an iPad worth up to £400. And in a different experiment another journalist spent £40 and won £35 of flowers and a £101 iPod Nano.

We apologise to Yipiii for not mentioning these. Also, we said customers can top up their accounts as often as they like. In fact, top-ups are limited to £200 per day.
