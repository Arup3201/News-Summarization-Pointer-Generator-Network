Francois Hollande today appealed for more efforts to boost financial growth across the eurozone and fired another warning shot at Germany for its focus on austerity.

The French President issued a stern warning that recession was as big a threat as budget deficits, ahead of a two-day European Union summit which begins tomorrow in Brussels, Belgium.

Troubled eurozone states should have the leeway to stimulate internal demand with salary rises and tax cuts, Mr Hollande told Le Monde and five other European newspapers in a joint interview.

‘If we don't breathe some life into Europe's economy, budget discipline measures won't work,’ the President said, adding that reducing big differences in borrowing costs must be a longer-term aim.

And the International Monetary Fund (IMF) weighed in this month, saying Greece, Portugal and Spain should be given more time to cut their public deficits.

Mr Hollande, 58, also wants the eurozone to move towards mutualised debt at a later stage in the form of jointly issued euro bonds.

But Germany opposes this at least until budget stragglers can get their public finances into shape.

‘The goal, too, is to harmonise interest rates in the euro zone,’ he said, noting it is unsustainable to have some states borrowing at one per cent interest and others at seven per cent.

‘Budgetary union must be completed with a partial mutualisation of debt, through euro bonds.’

Mr Hollande spoke ahead of the EU summit to discuss plans for stabilising the bloc's debt troubles.
