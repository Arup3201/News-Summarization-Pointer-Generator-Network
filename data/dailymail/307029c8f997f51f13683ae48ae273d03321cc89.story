A woman has made history by becoming the first quadruple amputee to walk the runway at New York Fashion Week.

Karen Crespo, 31, received a standing ovation  as she made her way down the catwalk for NYC-based designer Carrie Hammer's show on Friday morning at The Fashion Law Institute in Manhattan.

'I want people to know we can still be beautiful regardless of whether we're an amputee or in a wheelchair,' Ms Crespo, who lives in Los Angeles, said to ABC News. 'We can still rock the runway.'

Ms Crespo lost both her arms and legs after becoming infected with bacterial meningitis in 2011. During her sickness, she had two heart attacks, was in a coma for 15 days, and spent five months in the Intensive Care Unit.

She had a long and difficult recovery - and has still not been able to return to her job as a registered nurse.  

Ms Crespo emailed Ms Hammer earlier this year, after seeing footage from her February runway show in which one of the models was in a wheelchair.

'I was so thrilled and moved that a designer welcomed someone with a disability on the runway,' she wrote. 'Beauty comes in all shapes and sizes and there is absolutely no right or wrong.

'I have a passion for fashion, so I hope one day I will get to show the world "Why can't people with disabilities, people like me, be beautiful and model?" Maybe one day if I ever get to go to New York I will be able to come meet you.'

Ms Hammer, who prefers to use 'role models, not runway models' in her shows, immediately responded to Ms Crespo.

'You are so gorgeous,' she said. 'Your email was so lovely, kind and positive. I'm ecstatic you reached out to me.'

Two days later, the pair had a Skype phone call. Ms Hammer noticed she wasn't wearing her prosthetic arms and asked why. 

Ms Crespo's $100,000 prosthetic arms were stolen off her front porch when they arrived in the mail. Despite pleas she made on the local news, the thieves never returned her package.

'I was just sick when she told me this,' Ms Hammer said in a short, documentary-style video the two made together.

The designer reached out to Hanger Orthopedic Group, one of the nation's leaders in prosthetic limbs, who agreed to make her new arms. Ms Hammer made a trip to Ms Crespo's home in Los Angeles days before the show to surprise her with the news. 

'I told her, "We have your dress fitting, but we have a more important fitting. It's for your arms," Hammer said.

Ms Crespo, who was able to wear her new arms in time for the show, donned a past-the-knees red dress, aptly called 'The Karen,' on the catwalk. At the end of the runway, as the crowd applauded, she winked at the photographers.

 'I have a totally different perspective on things,' she told Today.com after her debut. 'Maybe this is why everything happened to me. Maybe I'm supposed to inspire or make a difference in someone else's life, someone who has a disability, or maybe just someone who had a lot of self-doubt.

'I never thought in a million years I would be at New York Fashion Week, even as a spectator,' she added. 'And now I'm going to be a fashion role model. It's such a big deal for me.'

Thanks to her new arms, Ms Crespo hopes to be able to return to work soon.  

In addition to Ms Crespo, Ms Hammer's show also featured transgender model Geena Rocero, military veteran Phoebe Gavin, and race car driver Colette Davis.
