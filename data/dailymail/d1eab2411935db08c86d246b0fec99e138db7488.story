A girl fitting the description of Lauren Hopkins was spotted in Birmingham

Police detectives hunting for a missing 15-year-old girl fear she may have been groomed over the internet.

Lauren Hopkins, from Haringey, north London, vanished on September 6 amid fears she may be in the company of older men, believed to be Asian, Scotland Yard said.

Officers said they were 'increasingly concerned' for the safety of the vulnerable schoolgirl and sources said the teenager had previously been in contact with older men on the web.

A girl fitting her description was seen in Birmingham 10 days ago.

'She may be with another girl she is believed to have befriended and both are vulnerable,' a spokeswoman said.

'They may also be in the company of older Asian males.'

Lauren is described as white, 5ft 4ins and of medium build with shoulder-length dark hair with a faded red tint.

At the time of the Birmingham sightings she was wearing a cream top and black leggings.

Anyone with information is asked to call Haringey missing persons unit on 020 8345 1809.
