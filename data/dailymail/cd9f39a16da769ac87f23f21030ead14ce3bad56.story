Glenn Murray and Marouane Chamakh both found the back of the net for Crystal Palace but it was not enough as Andre Gray inspired Brentford to victory.

Despite the defeat at Griffin Park, it was a good afternoon for Palace’s strikers as Tony Pulis opted to field two XI’s in simulations friendlies and as well as Murray and Chamakh scoring, summer signing Fraizer Campbell netted a hat-trick at Forest Green Rovers in a 3-0 win.

Palace, who finished 11th in the Premier League last season, face Arsenal in their season opener in two week’s time and will have to defend better than they did here if they are to get anything from that game. 

On target: Marouane Chamakh scored for Crystal Palace in their defeat by Brentford at Griffin Park

Difference: Andre Gray helped Brentford to a 3-2 victory over their Premier League opponents

Brentford: Button; McCormack, Tarkowski (Yennaris 72), Craig, Bidwell; Tebar (Dean 72), Douglas, Judge; Odubajo, Gray, Dallas (Smith 60)

Subs not used: Lee, Moore, Reeves, Diagouraga

Goals: Douglas 47, Gray 55, Odubajo 75.

Crystal Palace: Hennessey (Speroni 46); Ward, Dann, Delaney, Mariappa; Bolasie, Jedinak, Ledley, Puncheon; Chamakh, Murray

Subs not used: Gray, Boateng, Inniss, Kaikai

Goals: Murray 55 Chamakh 57.

They could opt to stat Brede Hangeland in that game who signed a one-year deal on Friday after leaving Fulham and Pulis opted to give him a run-out at Forest Green.

Gray netted for Mark Warburton’s men after Jonathan Douglas fired the Bees in front after the break and Moses Odubajo scored a goal worthy of winning any match.

And it was Brentford got off to the better start with Stuart Dallas testing Wayne Hennessey with a looping header in the first minute, then the Palace keeper was called into action again when Alan Judge shot from the left hand side of the penalty area.

But Palace got back into the game through Australian international Mile Jedinak who had two good chances.

The first was a shot that was deflected wide for a corner and then Jedinak forced David Button to make a save at his far post with a good downward header. 

Yannick Bolasie then forced Button to make an even better save as the Palace man fired a fierce shot from the edge of the area.

Despite Palace having much go the ball in the Brentford half, Adrian Mariappa showed he was still alert as he cleared a Gray’s first chance of the game off the line after the Brentford striker lobbed Hennessy.

But if Gray thought he was unlucky not to give the lead, he missed the opportunity to make up for it as he put a guilt edge chance over the bar on the stroke of half time when unmarked six yards out.

But Brentford did take the lead just after the break when Douglas turned Damien Delaney inside out and placed his shot neatly past substitute goalkeeper Julian Speroni.

Gray then made up for his two first half misses with a good finish past Speroni after beating Delaney once again to double Brentford’s advantage.

But Palace’s fightback started less than less than a minute later when Glenn Murray lifted the ball over Button from a yard out.

And then Chamakh levelled from close distance after Button failed to hold onto Joe Ledley’s shot.

But record singing Odubajo won the game for Brentford with brilliantly worked goal past Speroni to give Warburton’s men a confidence boost ahead of next week’s Championship opener against London rivals Charlton.
