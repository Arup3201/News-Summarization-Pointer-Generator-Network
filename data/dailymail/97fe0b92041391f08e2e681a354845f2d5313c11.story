These dazzling needle-like icicles that adorn the cliffs of Lake Superior draw almost 150,000 visitors every year.  

It allows them to explore waterfalls frozen in place, entire cliff faces encased in inches of ice and breathtaking icicles glistening in the milky sun.

The geological marvels at the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore have proved popular since they opened to winter travellers in 2009. 

Visitors to the site take in spectacular views such as waterfalls frozen in place - to manage the growing number of visitors, the National Park Service has proposed a $5 special recreation fee

But now, the National Park Service which operates the park in northern Wisconsin, has proposed a $5 special recreation fee to see the jaw-dropping site. 

The current $3 parking fee at the trail head lot brought in $47,000 last year, which was only a fraction of what it costs to manage about 138,000 visitors, according to the agency.

The proposed permit fee would allow the park service to provide sufficient staff and infrastructure during open ice caves season, although it wouldn't cover all of the associated costs.

During the summer, the caves are a popular destination as they can be accessed by kayak, but they're even more of a draw during winter when as many as 1,000 people a day make the trip on the weekend.

Since the National park in northern Wisconsin opened to winter travellers five years ago, it has soared in popularity 

'We are committed to keeping the park affordable but we also want to provide visitors with the best possible experience while not overburdening our partners,' said Chris Smith, acting superintendent of the park.

The park service plans to hold two open houses this month, one in Ashland and the other Bayfield, where the new fee will be discussed and members of the public will be able to put forward their views.

Because of ideal weather last winter, the lakeshore's mainland sea caves were open for the first time since 2009, when they saw fewer than 10,000 visitors. 

According to the park service, the unexpected surge of people brought in nearly $10 million in revenue throughout the local communities.
