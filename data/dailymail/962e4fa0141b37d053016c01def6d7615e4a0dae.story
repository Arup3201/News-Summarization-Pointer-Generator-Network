From muscled rugby players to stylish tennis hunks, the world of sport isn't short of a handsome chap or two.

Now the UK's rowing talent has stepped up to the plate to prove that football and tennis players aren't the only ones who know what they're doing when it comes to looking good.

Resplendent in jaunty pink and green stripes, natty scarlet and elegant navy, these striking shots show that Britain's boaters are both stylish and handsome.

Shot by former Ralph Lauren Rugby director of concept, F.E. Castleberry, the photos were taken to illustrate a quirky new fashion tome, Rowing Blazers.

The work of professional rower Jack Carlson, Rowing Blazers takes a closer look at the traditional jackets worn by boating club members - and features some of the hunkiest stars around.

Among them is Andy Triggs Hodge MBE, a double Olympic gold medallist and three-time world champion, and Alex Gregory MBE, who also took an Olympic gold for Team GB.

Blazers to feature in the book, each of which have different colours depending on the club, include that of the Eton rowing team, Cambridge University and the London Rowing Club.

One of the most popular wardrobe additions on the planet, blazers began life in 1825 with the scarlet jackets worn by rowers from the Lady Margaret Boat Club at St. John's College, Cambridge.

Later, the blazer was adopted by the Royal Navy, with the crew of HMS Blazer dressing their captain in a blue-and-white striped version of the jacket.

Striped jackets also proved popular with the mods in the 1960s, with mod icons such as The Who, the Rolling Stones and the Moody Blues regularly sporting variations.

Women, however, barely got a look in until 2006 when blazers exploded off the catwalk and into wardrobes, swiftly becoming a staple piece.

But as these photos prove, few do a natty blazer better than Britain's rowers.
