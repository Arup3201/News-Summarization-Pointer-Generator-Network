'All of a sudden that reel starts screaming,’ Mr Saldamando told ABC’s Good Morning America. ‘And there's no sound like a reel screaming to get you excited.’

He was struggling for 30 minutes with the shark before he grabbed the tail and started to reel it in.

Success: Mr Saldamando eventually brings the shark under control by using his sheer strength

However he eventually brings the shark under control by using his sheer strength.

‘Once you're in the water it's a whole different scenario,’ Mr Westgaard told ABC’s Good Morning America.

‘You can see that shot of that shark dangling below him. At any moment that shark could have arched up and taken his Achilles out, a calf, a thigh.’

The video does not appear to show shark-finning or another illegal act, reported the Huffington Post.
