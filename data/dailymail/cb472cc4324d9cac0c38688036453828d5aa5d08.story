Rush Limbaugh has admitted to being 'racist' following comments he made about actor Idris Elba.

The eternally outspoken host decided to address news out of the Sony hack that Elba was being eyed to play James Bond once Daniel Craig exited the franchise, declaring it unacceptable for a black actor to even be considered for the iconic role of 007.

He then took it a step further by saying the idea of casting Elba as Bond, a fictional storybook spy created by author Ian Fleming, was as ridiculous as a white actor playing a black historical figure.

'James Bond is a total concept put together by Ian Fleming. He was white and Scottish. Period. That is who James Bond is, was,' said Limbaugh as he began his diatribe.

'But now [they are] suggesting that the next James Bond should be Idris Elba, a black Briton, rather than a white from Scotland.'

The polarizing pundit then acknowledged that he was being racist, seemingly unfazed by the realization, adding; 'That’s not who James Bond is and I know it’s racist to probably point this out.' 

Limbaugh did not reveal however how he feels about Craig playing Bond, or make mention of actors David Niven, George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton or Pierce Brosnan, who, while white, are not Scottish.

In fact, of the seven men to have played the smooth-talking spy over the past 50 years, only one is actually Scottish - the very first Bond, Sean Connery.

Despite these inarguable facts, Limbaugh still declared at one point during the show; 'Fifty years of white Bond because Bond is white. Always Scottish. Always drank vodka.' 

Things then got taken a step further when Limbaugh said that casting Elba, whose phonetical name proved challenging for Limbaugh to pronounce throughout the segment, as Bond would be like casting George Clooney as President Obama or Kelsey Grammer as Nelson Mandela. 

It didn't stop there either, with Limbaugh imagining Kate Hudson playing Michelle Obama and Scarlett Johansson as Condoleezza Rice as scenarios as ludicrous as a black man playing Bond, before capping it all off by suggesting British actor Hugh Grant playing the role of gay footballer Michael Sam is akin to Elba as Bond.

Limbaugh then declared 'we’re just playing here,' before moving on to his next talking point. 

It is also worth noting that the self-described Bond fanatic Limbaugh's claim that 007 'always drank vodka' is also not accurate, as the spy drinks a variety of different beverages in Flemming's novels.
