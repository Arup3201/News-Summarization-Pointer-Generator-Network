Two priceless medieval panels depicting saints  have been stolen from a remote church.

A third was damaged when thieves cut the artworks from a choir screen at 15th-century Holy Trinity church in  Torbryan, Devon.

The panels are as rare as a Turner or Rembrandt, said an expert, who feared they may have been stolen to order.

Examination: Dr Neil Rushton, from the Churches Conservation Trust, examines the remaining damaged panels and the gaping hole left following the theft

'Priceless': Two mid-15th Century panels depicting medieval saints were stolen from the church in Devon

‘Paintings of God, Mary and the 
Apostles are two a penny in English churches, which is why it is 
possible these thieves targeted lesser saints as they are much rarer,’ 
said Dr Neil Rushton, an arts historian with the Churches Conservation 
Trust.

‘This is the best example of this type
of medieval art in this country. They are as unique and priceless as a 
Turner or a Rembrandt and are irreplaceable. They are intrinsic to this 
building and the theft devalues the whole church.’

The panels, about 18in by 6in,  were 
part of a series of 40 depicting God, Mary, the Apostles and other 
saints set in a rood or choir screen that was a common feature in 
medieval church architecture.

Investigation: Thieves used a knife to rip out the panels, leaving a hole in the screen and damaging a third artwork in the process

Those stolen featured St Victor of 
Marseilles and St Margaret of Antioch, while the one that was left 
damaged pictured a female saint.

The panels were once whitewashed   to 
protect them from the puritanical zeal of the Reformation, when many of 
the intricate screens, especially those that included representations of
saints, were taken down.

'Rare': The panels belonged to one section of the screen that spans the aisles of the historic church

Dr Rushton said the panels were of 
‘cathedral quality’. ‘They have been painted by a specially commissioned
artist who would have been a top artist of his day,’ he added.

‘They are contemporary to when the 
church was built. It shows  there was a lot of money around here at the 
time, mostly from the  wool trade.

Historic: The 15th Century church deep in the Devon countryside was targeted by thieves in a 'devastating' blow

‘Unless the damage to one panel was an
accident, it is difficult to understand why those who did it bashed it 
when they did such a delicate job of removing the other two.’

Experts believe the paintings may have been stolen due to their rarity.

The panels have been described as 'the best example of this type of panels in this country' and 'as unique and priceless as a Turner or a Rembrandt'.

The panels in the pre-Reformation church have survived 'exceptionally' well from the late medieval period and feature lesser saints, making them much rarer than paintings of God, Mary and the apostles.

It is also believed the artist was specially commissioned to produce the panels for the screens due to the 'very high status' of the artistry involved.

The church itself was built in the 15th century and is designated by English Heritage as a Grade 1 listed building.

A number of other panels have been 
stolen in the past but Crispin Truman, the chief executive of the 
Churches Conservation Trust  charity, said the Torbryan screen remained 
‘probably the best  preserved medieval rood screen in the country’.

‘They are fantastic examples of 
craftsmanship of the time,’ he said. ‘The value of these panels is in 
the building, they belong there.’

Holy Trinity is open to the public and
still hosts services.

Dr Rushton admitted that it would not have been 
difficult for the thieves to carry out the crime because of the trust’s 
policy of trying to keep churches open.

‘We do not want locked doors and people turning up and not being able to get in,’ he said.

‘But we take a risk if someone’s determined enough they are going to come in and steal.’

While acknowledging that the panels 
were essentially priceless because of their rarity.

He added: ‘Someone 
may pay a lot of money for them or they may be sold at a car boot sale 
for ten quid – we really don’t know.’
