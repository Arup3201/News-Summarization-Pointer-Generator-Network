Baroness Warsi said the talks are much-needed because 'Groups like Al-Muhajiroun and the EDL argue you cannot be British and Muslim'

Muslim soldiers will be asked to deliver talks in schools to help counter extremism following the Woolwich murders.

Some 650 Muslim personnel will use their experiences to convince youngsters that it is possible to follow Islam and be a patriotic Briton.

Soldiers of both sexes, including those who have served in Afghanistan and Iraq and some who have been injured, will address school assemblies, particularly in areas that have seen a spike in hate crimes.

Attacks and abuse against Muslims rose eight-fold in the wake of the murder of drummer Lee Rigby in May. A month later they were still running at 36 a week.

The latest idea to tackle radicalism is understood to have been championed by Baroness Warsi, the minister for Faith and Communities, and plans are said to be at an advanced stage.

A senior Government source said it was vital to dispel myths perpetuated by radical Islamists and far Right organisations such as the English Defence League that ‘the West is at war with Islam’. 

‘This is an opportunity for men and women in uniform today – Muslim and non-Muslim – to go into schools and show that people of all faiths are serving alongside each in our army forces’, the source said.

‘It sends a really powerful message post-Woolwich – mainly because it was an attack on soldiers, but also because it condemns the extremist narrative that you can’t be a practising Muslim and a loyal British citizen serving your country in the armed forces.’ 

The visits will be co-ordinated around next year’s activities in schools to mark the centenary of the First World War, in which hundreds of thousands of Muslim soldiers fought and died for Britain.

Educational programmes will focus on the millions of Commonwealth soldiers who served in the war – including the 1.2million Indian soldiers who fought, 74,000 of whom died.

Baroness Warsi, whose grandparents fought in the Second World War, added: ‘This is particularly potent at a time when questions are regularly raised about loyalty and identity, about who genuinely belongs to this country and about our history.

'Groups like Al-Muhajiroun and the EDL argue you cannot be British and Muslim.’

Two proposals are being considered, one led by Imam Ali Omar, the Army’s new Civilian Chaplain to the Military, and the Curzon Institute, an independent defence and security advisory group.

After facing dangers in Afghanistan such as roadside bombs and suicide attacks, some Muslim soldiers have also spoken of threats from extremists within their own community on their return to the UK.

David Cameron declared in 2011 that the doctrine of multiculturalism had ‘failed’ and that British Muslims must subscribe to mainstream values of freedom and equality.

However, some in Government believe not enough has been done to ease community tensions since then.

One senior Conservative said that it was not until the ‘wake-up call of Woolwich’ that the Government has taken community cohesion seriously.

‘It’s been a long battle to even get the issue recognised’, the source said.
