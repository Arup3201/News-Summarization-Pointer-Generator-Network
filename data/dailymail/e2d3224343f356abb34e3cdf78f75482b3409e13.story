Two moments of ‘magic’ from Danny Cipriani lifted Sale into the Premiership top four on Friday night. 

Cipriani, watched by England coach Stuart Lancaster, struck in the 50th minute by making a try for wing Mark Cueto and followed up by scoring one himself nine minutes later. 

Sale’s head coach Steve Diamond described Cipriani’s play as ‘magic’ and insisted the playmaker would sign a new deal despite mounting speculation over interest from rival Premiership clubs led by Harlequins.

 Diamond added: ‘Danny wants to stay in Manchester. We will get round to having a chat in the next week or two and, hopefully, get it nailed.’ 

Cipriani sustained a leg injury in scoring his try and missed the last 20 minutes when a late try from Exeter’s No 8 Thomas Waldrom earned a losing bonus point. 

Diamond also praised the pressure of his pack which helped Sale dominate the first half to earn a 6-3 lead through two penalties from Cipriani to one by Gareth Steenson.

‘Danny produced two moments of magic as he does, but that was more down to the pressure of the forwards,’ Diamond commented. 

Exeter’s head coach Rob Baxter had no complaints. 

‘We were physically and mentally not quite there,’ he admitted. 

Baxter watched his team, who had put together an unbeaten run of eight games, make a slow start which brought sin bins for forwards Damien Welch and Ben White.
