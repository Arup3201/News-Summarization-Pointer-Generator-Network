The Rangers Supporters Trust believe their legal action stopped Mike Ashley being given security over Ibrox this week – but they still harbour fears for the future.

The fan-ownership group went to court on Monday seeking an interim interdict to prevent the Ibrox board from including the stadium in a deal with Ashley’s Sports Direct firm.

Talks with club laywers then produced an agreement that ensures security over Ibrox cannot be granted until February 17.

Rangers have been troubled by off-field financial difficulties that have led to the club's plight

Advance notices of security submitted to the Registry of Scotland on behalf of Sports Direct a fortnight ago had suggested such a move was in the pipeline and prompted protests from supporters.

But the terms of the £10 million loan – comprised of two £5 million tranches - announced on Tuesday instead included security over Murray Park, Edmiston House, Albion car park and club trademarks.

The RST believe they only have a partial victory as they remain concerned about the gap between their agreement expiring and the forthcoming EGM, at which Dave King will seek to oust the current board.

A date for that meeting is yet to be announced and could, under normal protocol, be at the end of next month.

‘Following detailed legal advice, the Rangers Supporters Trust (RST), with the financial backing of the Rangers Fans Fighting Fund (RFFF), submitted a petition to the Court of Session in Edinburgh on Monday 26th January, seeking an interim interdict to stop the Rangers board from granting security over Ibrox in favour of Sports Direct,’ said an RST statement.

‘Discussions between our lawyers and the board’s lawyers continued over the past three days. The conclusion of these discussions was the that board has agreed not to grant security over Ibrox for a period up until the 17th February covered by the advance notice they submitted.

The Rangers Supporters Trust are still concerned about the future of the football club

‘We are disappointed that we were not able to secure the extension of this commitment until the date of the upcoming EGM, as this now leaves a short period of time in which the board could grant security over Ibrox before they are hopefully removed.

‘This is particularly concerning given the announcement yesterday that a further period of due diligence is required for the second £5m tranche of debt that the board has decided to saddle the club with.

‘We believe our actions had a material impact in stopping the board from granting security over Ibrox. The revised deal with Sports Direct was agreed late on Monday night according to Paul Shackleton, the club’s AIM nomad. 

'This was immediately following the petition submitted to the court, the announcement of which delayed what would have been a necessary interdict hearing in the Court of Session on Tuesday.

‘We do not believe that the filing of a notice of intention to grant security over Ibrox was an error and we believe that a fixed security over Ibrox would most likely have been granted to Sports Direct had it not been challenged. We would like to register our disappointment that it was necessary to take legal action to hold this board to their public promises to shareholders and fans.

‘Whilst we are pleased that the immediate danger posed to Ibrox has been averted, we share the anger of other fans at the latest act of corporate piracy perpetrated by the current Rangers directors. 

Dave King will seek to oust the current board at the next AGM

'By accepting this deal with Sports Direct, they have plunged our club into an unnecessary level of debt and, by pawning off further revenue streams including shirt sponsorship, have limited our ability to repay that debt.

‘They have done this in their own interests and those of Mike Ashley. David Somers, Derek Llambias, James Easdale and Barry Leach have, in our opinion, neglected their duties to the PLC they are meant to represent.’
