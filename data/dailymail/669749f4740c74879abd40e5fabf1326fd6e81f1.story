Health workers have jeered the Spanish prime minister and thrown gloves at him as he visited the Madrid hospital where a nurse with Ebola is being treated today amid claims staff are stressed out.

The nurses gathered around Mariano Rajoy's motorcade at the end of his visit to the Carlos III hospital to protest at the government's handling of the case of Teresa Romero. 

The nurse, is the first person to have contracted Ebola outside of Africa, after becoming infected by a Spanish priest repatriated from Africa with the disease as she treated him at the Carlos III Hospital.

The protest comes amid reports staff at the hospital are working under stressful conditions as some stay away from work 

She is said to be in a serious but stable condition and has being described as at 'serious risk' of dying by Madrid's regional leader. 

The protest comes after it was reported staff were working under stressful conditions at the hospital as some nurses stay away from work, fearful they might catch the deadly virus.

One of the nurses caring for Mrs Romero, Charly Manuel Torres, told AFP: 'There are fewer staff signing up to help by providing voluntary extra cover at the hospital.

'We are very stressed. We are working under a lot of pressure.' 

Some health workers are reportedly calling in sick with some even resigning so they don't have to go to the hospital 

Health workers' unions have also said that the protective equipment that they have been provided with is substandard 

According to other reports, medical workers have been calling in sick with some even formally resigning from their posts.

Meanwhile health workers' unions say training and equipment at the Carlos III hospital were insufficient to deal with the deadly Ebola crisis.

Health professionals have blamed substandard equipment and protective suits for the infection spreading.

Carlos III hospital specialises in infectious diseases but parts have been closed at a time of public spending cuts 

The hospital also specialises in infectious diseases but parts of it were recently closed at a time of public spending cuts. 

But after visiting the Carlos III hospital where the infected nurse lay, the prime minister said the situation was 'complex and difficult,' but he was 'absolutely convinced' everything necessary would be done to beat the crisis.

The deputy premier Soraya Saenz de Santamria also told a news conference the government was working 'to give the best care possible to Teresa Romero, to transmit calm to the population and to coordinate our actions.'

Ms Saenz said she herself would head the new committee, which will bring together Health Minister Ana Mato and representatives of various other ministries.

Teresa Romero, the Spanish nurse who has been infected with Ebola. She has been described as gravely ill but in a stable condition 

It comes after seven people turned themselves in to an Ebola isolation unit in Madrid yesterday, where Mrs Romero is being cared for.

The seven new admissions included two hairdressers who had given Romero a beauty treatment before she was diagnosed with Ebola, and hospital staff who had treated the 44-year-old nurse. 

A hospital spokeswoman said there were now 14 people in the isolation unit on its sealed-off sixth floor. 

Among them were Mrs Romero's, her husband, and health workers who had cared for her since she was admitted on Monday. 

Two doctors who treated her have been admitted for precautionary observation, while two nurses who worked alongside Mrs Romero Ramos are also in quarantine.

One of the doctors has complained that the sleeves on his protective suit were too short. 

It has also been alleged that the nurse found out she had the virus through a media report, while looking at her mobile phone.

Unions have accused the government of seeking to deflect the blame on to Mrs Romero for the failings of its health system 

Spanish labour unions accused the government of seeking to deflect the blame on to Mrs Romero for the failings of its health system, after the European Union asked Spain to explain how the virus could have been spread on a high-security ward.

The top regional health official in Madrid, Javier Rodriguez, has said Mrs Romero took too long to admit she had made a mistake by touching her face with the glove of her protective suit while taking it off.

In a radio interview he said: 'She has taken days to recognise that she may have made a mistake when taking off the suit. If she had said it earlier, it would have saved a lot of work.

But the nurse's brother Jose Ramon told the newspaper El Pais: 'They will find any way to blame her. Basically, my sister did her job ... and she has become infected with Ebola.'

The anger also comes amid an investigation into a possible lapse in health safety protocol led, which led to Mrs Romero being infected and why it took a week for medics to admit her to hospital.
