Before the shooting Orsborn thought he took all the bullets out of the gun, Martin's roommate told the affiliate station. 

'I'm in shock; it's not something I'm used to hearing,' neighbor Annette Chance told WJAX.

Martin's boyfriend told WOKV Orsborn had claimed the shooting was accidental.

Three years ago, Orsborn had been convicted on an aggravated assault with a deadly weapon charge, KMOV reported.

Orsborn has been charged with manslaughter, as well as possession of ammunition by a convicted felon, WJAX reported.

Orsborn's acquaintance Nick Mooradian told WCJB 'I knew him, he used to work at the gas station in front of the neighborhood. 

'He was a normal guy, he seemed really calm. Never thought this would happen, that he would do something like that.'
