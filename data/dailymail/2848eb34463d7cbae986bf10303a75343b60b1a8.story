Michelle Obama has written an open letter to Newtown as the community struggles to come to terms with one of the deadliest school shootings in U.S. history.

The First Lady penned words of comfort to the small Connecticut town which is today enduring more funerals after the attack on Sandy Hook elementary school one week ago.

Last Friday, 20 children and six teaching staff were killed by a gunman who then took his own life. The shooter had earlier killed his mother Nancy Lanza at her home.

Sharing their pain: Michelle Obama wrote an open letter to the community of Newtown telling them that America holds them in their hearts

Mrs Obama wrote: 'I cannot begin to imagine the depths of 
your grief. I know that for many of you, the pain you are enduring right
 now seems unbearable.'

However she said that the community would slowly heal based on 'the countless acts of courage, kindness and love here in Newtown and across America'.

Six funerals and two wakes have been scheduled for today. A moment of silence for the victims took place at 9.30am this morning.

Governor Dan Malloy, Lt. Governor Nancy Wyman and Newtown First Selectman Patricia Llodra met on the steps of Newtown town hall as bells from Trinity Episcopal Church rang 26 times for each life lost at Sandy Hook.

Grief: Mourners leave the funeral of six-year-old Jesse Lewis as the long line of funerals continued today in Newtown

Over the past week, we as Americans 
have been united in our grief as Newtown has laid to rest so many 
beautiful, innocent children, along with the heroic educators who worked
 every day to help them achieve their dreams.

As
 a mother of two young daughters, my heart aches for you and your 
families. Like so many Americans, I wish there were something - anything
 - I could do or say to ease your anguish.

But
 I know that I cannot begin to imagine the depths of your grief. I know 
that for many of you, the pain you are enduring right now seems 
unbearable; and many of you may be asking yourselves, how can we go on -
 as families and as a community?

But
 I also know that we have already begun to see the answer to that 
question in the countless acts of courage, kindness and love here in 
Newtown and across America.

Over
 the past week, I have been awed and inspired by Newtown's heroes: the 
first responders who risked their lives at a moment's notice; the 
educators whose devotion to their students shone brightest in one of our
 nation's darkest hours; the children who comforted each other despite 
their fear; the families coming together to support each other as they 
grieve.

And I am so proud 
of the outpouring of love and support that has come from every corner of
 America: from first responders from neighboring cities rushing to help 
however they could; from people in Cleveland and Charlotte and Juneau 
and so many other communities joining together to honor Newtown with 
their thoughts and prayers; and in living rooms and houses of worship 
and the halls of our government, where we are beginning to have those 
difficult conversations about how we can build a safer, more peaceful 
tomorrow for all our children.

And
 I want you to know that this is just the beginning. As my husband has 
said, in the coming weeks, he will use all the powers of his office to 
engage citizens from across this country to find ways to prevent 
tragedies like this one. And please know that every minute of every day,
 we are thinking of you, and praying for you, and holding you and your 
families in our hearts as you begin the slow and wrenching work of 
healing and moving forward.

In
 the months and years ahead, may the memories of those beautiful 
children and those heroic adults be a blessing for their families, for 
your community, and for our country, and may God bless you all.

President Obama took part in the moment of silence at the White House. The President visited the small Connecticut town earlier in the week to comfort grieving families and survivors.

Obama also told mourners that America was not doing enough to protect its children and pledged a huge 
effort to 'prevent more tragedies like this'.

'You are not alone in your grief,' President Obama said. 'All across this land our world too has 
been torn apart.

'All across this land we wept with you and pulled our 
children tight. Newtown, you are not alone.'

In one of the most religious speeches of his presidency, Mr Obama talked about how the ultimate goal for a society is to protect their children.

'If
 we don't get that right, we don't get anything right. By that measure, 
can we truly say as a nation that we are doing our obligations?' he 
said.

'We gather here in memory of 20 
beautiful children and six remarkable adults. They lost their lives in a
 school that could have been any school in a quiet town full of good and
 decent people that could have been any town in America.

'All
 across this land of ours, we have wept with you. We've pulled our 
children tight, and you must know whatever measure of comfort we can 
provide, we will provide it.'
