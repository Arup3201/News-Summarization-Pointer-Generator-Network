Supermarkets that deal with suppliers unfairly could be fined by a new industry regulator, it was revealed today.

New rules to be introduced by Competition Minister Jo Swinson will give the Groceries Code Adjudicator the power to name and shame offenders.

It will also be able to suggest recommendations and levy fines against companies found to have breached industry guidelines.

A new watchdog, the Groceries Code Adjudicator, will be given the power to name and shame supermarkets that treat farmers unfairly

Ms Swinson said: 'Where supermarkets are breaking the rules with suppliers and treating them unfairly, the adjudicator will make sure that they are held to account.

'We have heard the views of the stakeholders who were keen to give the adjudicator a power to fine, and recognise that this change would give the adjudicator more teeth to enforce the Groceries Code.'

The change was immediately attacked by the British Retail Consortium as 'unnecessary and heavy-handed'.

British Retail Consortium director general Stephen Robertson told The Daily Telegraph: 'Weâ€™ve long maintained that the power to impose fines is unnecessary and heavy-handed and should be kept in reserve.

'This flies in the face of common sense and is yet another piece of disproportionate legislation aimed at food retailers.

'It's a major let-down and makes it even more important that retailers are given a full right of appeal against being fined or "named and shamed".'

The new adjudicator is expected to publish guidelines on its approach to sanctions within six months of the new Bill coming into effect, expected some time next year.

As well as fining companies the adjudicator will be able to arbitrate disputes between retailers and suppliers and investigate confidential complaints from direct and indirect suppliers.

Ms Swinson said: 'The food industry plays an important role in economic growth, and the Groceries Code Adjudicator will help to ensure that the market is operating in a fair and healthy way.

'Large supermarkets form a big chunk of this industry, and generally provide consumers with low prices and variety whilst providing business for farmers and suppliers.'
