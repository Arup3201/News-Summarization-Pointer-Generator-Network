More than 30 years old and with 13,000 miles on the clock this little old Fiat would normally fetch around £6,000.

But this pint-sized classic commanded more than three times its market value after sparking a bidding war at auction.

The reason for it's more sizeable fee? - it was once owned by David Cameron.

Fiat for a king: The pint-sized Fiat 500 was once good enough for the PM, and having him as a famous former owner ensured it went for a large fee at auction

Bought by the PM as a birthday present for his wife Samantha, the pair are believed to have put 1,000 miles on the vintage Italian car.

With trips around the idyllic Cotswolds they held onto the 1971 Italian car for the best part of 10 years having acquired it in 1998.

Despite its famous former owner it was still only expected to go for around £2,000 more than its usual price when it went up for sale at Silverstone Auctions at the Footman James Classic Motor Show at the NEC on Saturday.

But a bidding war broke out with the winner paying £18,150 for the car.

Birthday present: David Cameron bought the 1971 Fiat for his wife Samantha in 1998

Will Smith, from Silverstone Auctions, said: 'We’re delighted with the sale and the lady who owned it is over the moon too - it goes to show what a famous owner can do for the price of a classic car.

'There were two main bidders, one in the room and one on the phone and they wouldn’t stop bidding - they both really wanted the car.'

Mr Smith revealed the winning bid eventually came over the phone from a Brit who would be adding the little Fiat to his private collection.

Fiat built the 500 between 1957 and 1975 with the humble vehicle one the most iconic and unmistakable cars of the 20th century.

With a tiny 479 cc two-cylinder, air-cooled engine, the Fiat 500 epitomises chic, working class motoring and is a far cry  from the Jaguar XJ David Cameron is ferried around in on a day-to-day basis.

This original right-hand drive Fiat 500 L was first registered on 20th August 1971 in Warwickshire and has covered what is believed to be a genuine 13,000 miles from new.

Cotswold taxi driver Tim Ashby wrote a letter to David Cameron in 2008 after he took him home one evening, offering to buy the Fiat.

The small Fiat is a far cry from the cars the PM is more used to now with him more likely to be seen in a chauffeur driven Jaguar

The then future MP duly obliged, selling the little car for just £1,000 with Mr Ashby describing Cameron as a 'lovely man to deal with'.

It was later restored before its current owner bought it from Mr Ashby after he ran out of space.

Nick Whale, managing director, Silverstone Auctions, added: 'No matter what your political persuasion, this is one cool car.'
