Accident: Mark Shepard struck his head in June during a stag weekend in Tenerife and is still unable to walk or talk, almost five months after the accident

A bridegroom who struck his head during a stag weekend in Tenerife is still unable to walk or talk, almost five months after the accident.

Mark Shepard, 30, had been due to wed his fiancée Deborah Taylor, 29, on July 9.

He was celebrating his forthcoming wedding with his brothers and friends in June when he fell and hit his head on a stone pillar.

The keen rugby player, from Widnes, 
Cheshire, spent three weeks in a coma at a hospital in the Canary 
Islands before being airlifted to Whiston Hospital in Prescot, 
Merseyside.

He is now receiving care at a specialist unit in Netherley and can breathe on his own.

Consultants are confident he could recover but do not know how long it could take.

Mr
Shepard’s father William, 54, said: 'It has been very hard for all of 
us. The severity of the brain damage means they don’t know how long it 
will take.

'He can recognise all of us. If we say "Where is Mum, Dad, or Debbie?" he will move his head and look around at us.

'He can understand everything that is being said but he can’t correspond with us.

'He is not paralysed. It’s his brain injury that won’t let him move. The doctors say in terms of brain injury, it is still quite early.

'In time, they believe he may be able to move.'

Mr Shepard played rugby for Simms Cross and only gave up the sport to concentrate on his job as an engineer with Guinness in Runcorn, Cheshire.

His father said: 'His general health is quite good because he is a fit boy from playing rugby.'

Miss Taylor, a traffic clerk, is constantly at his side with his family.

Mr Shepard’s father, mother Bernadette, sister Katie and brothers Gareth, Craig and Dave would like to thank everyone for their support.

Mr Shepard Sr said: 'Debbie has been a tower of strength. She has done really well.

'We
are very grateful and humbled by the response we’ve had from everyone 
in the town for Mark. They’ve helped to raise a lot of money which we 
have put into a special account for him so if he needs anything, the 
funds are there.'

Widnes 
Vikings all-stars will be playing Halton Simms Cross amateur rugby team 
at a charity match in aid of Mr Shepard at 1.30pm on Sunday.

The
team will include former players such as Mark Foster, Sean Richardson, 
Tane Manihera and Phil Hassan. They will be coached by ex-Vikings 
assistant coach, Stuart Wilkinson, assisted by John Stankevitch. Halton 
Simms Cross will be coached by Alan Billington assisted by Phil Fox.

Fundraising will continue from 7pm at Widnes Bowling Club.

Both events are being organised by Liam Fox, whose father coaches Halton Simms Cross.

Mr Fox, 32, said: 'I know Mark’s dad and just wanted to do something to help.

'Loads
of ex-pro Widnes players have offered to help. It will be a great game.
I’m hoping as many people as possible will turn up and support them.'

Admission is free. Attendees will be invited to make donations.
