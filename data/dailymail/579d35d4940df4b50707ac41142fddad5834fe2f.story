Prospective house-buyers are now as drawn in by high-spec interior features such as underfloor heating and marble floors as they are by proximity to good schools when looking for a new home.

Our taste for grander and grander designs means we are being enticed through sellers' doors by granite kitchen surfaces, elaborate home entertainment systems, walk-in wardrobes and Smeg fridges - and savvy estate agents are focusing on these buzzwords to prick up our ears.

Property listings are increasingly mentioning 'high-spec interiors', and of those which do the most common feature is underfloor 
heating (63 per cent), while
over a quarter (27 per cent) boast of quality finishes such as granite work 
surfaces and marble flooring.

High-spec interiors such as Smeg fridges, marble floors, granite work tops and elaborate entertainment systems are enticing home buyers more and more

Other high-spec features noted include ceiling speakers (two per cent) and luxury fittings such as walk-in wardrobes and built-in entertainment centres (one per cent).

The kudos of premium brands is also important, with two per cent of high spec homes listing either Smeg or Miele appliances as part of their marketed qualities.

The research was compiled by insurance firm Aviva, who found that of the five million plus 
properties for sale in the UK, some 257,000 are now 
described as having a 'high-spec interior'.

The analysis also showed that while 'ambience' remains an important factor for selling properties (mentioned in nearly two per cent of the five million listings analysed), estate agents are advocating the serene locations of flats and houses for sale, above their proximity to lively bars, cafes and restaurants.

Would you buy a home for its proximity to good local schools, or for its ability to properly catalogue your clothes in a walk-in wardrobe?

In nearly two-fifths (61 per cent) of homes described as having 'ambient features', the peaceful and tranquil location is highlighted, compared to only one in ten that mention local or country pubs (13 per cent).

And despite the rise of local independent coffee chains, only 300 ambient properties list café culture as a selling point, and two thirds (72 per cent) of those mentions are located in Greater London.

Interestingly, where schools are mentioned as a key feature, homes in the South East are most likely to use proximity as a selling point, while in the North East schools are only referenced as a selling point for two per cent of homes.

Within the results for 'garden features', 12 per cent of properties in Greater London list a garden as a main quality. Over a quarter (28 per cent) offer a large garden, and seven per cent offer a 'beautiful or attractive garden'.

The most favoured was a south-facing garden, featuring in over half (55 per cent) of property descriptions in the capital.

Transportation is one of the less important features (mentioned in less than one per cent of the five million analysed listings), almost three quarters (72 per cent) of homes that reference transportation state that they are ideally located for an easy commute. 

Within this feature category, homes in the West Midlands (five per cent), Wales (five per cent) and the North East (four per cent) are least likely to list transport links.

Commenting on the research, Heather Smith, director of home insurance at Aviva said: 'We all fall in love with properties for different reasons, and while the character and charm of a home is a matter of personal taste, it seems that assets such as smart flooring and on-trend kitchen brands are as important to some buyers as transport links and schools.

'And with the pace of life so fast for many of us, it’s not surprising that home buyers are looking for a little refuge from their busy working lives and would prefer tranquillity to buzzing bars and local pubs.

'But whether you plump for marble flooring or laminate, walk-in wardrobe or flat-packed furniture make sure you can also afford to maintain the perfect home once you find it.

'And if you’re lucky enough to get some swanky fixtures and fittings as part of the purchase, ensure you tell your home insurer so you can be certain you have the right cover to protect everything in your new home.'
