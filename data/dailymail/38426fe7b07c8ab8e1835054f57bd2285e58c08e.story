Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola says there is no time-frame for the return of midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger from his left knee injury.

Schweinsteiger has been named the new Germany captain, but the World Cup winner has not played since the tournament in Brazil. He will miss the upcoming 2016 European Championship qualifiers against Poland and Ireland.

According to Guardiola, 'Basti will come back,' but he declined to speculate on a date. He says there is 'no pressure' on Schweinsteiger to speed up his return.

Bayern Munich manager Pep Guardiola would not give a return date for the German midfielder 

Schweinsteiger is training daily at home, but Guardiola says 'we play with the ball, not with the bike.'

Guardiola also revealed that winger Franck Ribery  needs 'more time' to return from his left knee injury.

Bayern lead the Bundesliga by two points and host Hannover on Saturday.
