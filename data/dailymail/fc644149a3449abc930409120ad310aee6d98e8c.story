A Mexican mayor and his wife have been accused of being involved in the disappearance of 43 students who are believed to have been abducted by a drugs cartel. 

Jose Luis Abarca, who is mayor of Iguala and his wife Maria de los Angeles Pineda Villa are both accused of having strong links with the Guerreros Unidos cartel. 

Arbarca ordered the arrest of the 43 students who were protesting against the drugs gang on September 26, who were then handed over to the cartel.

Mayor of Iguala,  Jose Luis Abarca, right, and his wife Maria de los Angeles Pineda Villa, left, are on the run after Federal authorities accused him of taking monthly bribes of up to $220,000 from a drugs cartel

Abarca is accused of ordering the arrest of 43 students and handing them over to a drugs cartel  

The mayor and his wife have gone on the run along with the police chief although 52 people have been arrested

The cartel is understood to have paid Arbarca a monthly retainer of up to $220,000 and effectively ran the city which is in the Guerrero state.

Since the abductions, protests in the city have become increasingly violent with the burning of Iguala's city hall. The protests have prompted Mexican authorities to act and find the missing students. 

Attorney General Jesus Murillo Karam said on Wednesday that investigators had found a total of nine mass graves containing 30 sets of human remains during the hunt for the missing students. He said officials were waiting for a second round of DNA tests, after a first round determined they weren't the bodies of the students.

While the students remain missing, Murillo Karam said the arrests of Iguala police officers and the leader of the Guerreros Unidos gang, Sidronio Casarrubias, had provided more evidence about the events leading up to their disappearance.

Murillo Karam said the students, who attended a radical rural teachers college, had gained the enmity of Iguala Mayor Jose Luis Abarca because of a previous demonstration in the city. He said Abarca ordered police to detain students who hijacked four buses because the mayor thought they were going to try to disrupt a speech by his wife, Maria de los Angeles Pineda.

Abarca, his wife and the Iguala police chief are all fugitives. A total of 52 people, including police officers, Iguala officials and gang members, have been arrested in the case.

Thousands of people took to the streets of Iguala to protest about the abduction of the missing students  

Authorities had previously reported that the mayor's wife, Pineda, had family ties to Guerreros Unidos. But Murillo Karam said it was much more than that, reporting that Casarrubias, the arrested drug gang leader, said she was 'the main operator of criminal activities' in Iguala. Casarrubias also said the mayor had gotten payments of 2 million to 3 million pesos ($150,000-$220,000) every few weeks, as a bribe and to pay off his corrupt police force.

After Iguala police picked up the students, Murillo Karam said, the youths were taken to a police station and then to the nearby town of Cocula. At some point they were loaded aboard a dump truck and taken — apparently still alive — to an area on the outskirts of Iguala where the mass graves have been found, he said.

At that point, Casarrubias told authorities, one of his lieutenants told him the students were members or sympathizers of a rival gang, the attorney general said.

Investigators discovered a mass grave containing 30 bodies although DNA tests confirmed they were not the missing students although further tests are being carried out in a bid to determine their identity  

Since the abductions, protests have turned increasingly violent with mobs attacking government buildings 

The families  claim that Abarca colluded with the drug cartel and is responsible for the abductions 

Guerreros Unidos had sufficient money to bribe the mayor and local police force because they have increasingly turned to the lucrative practice of growing opium poppies and sending opium paste to be refined for heroin destined for the U.S. market, according to a Mexican official.

The official said Guerreros Unidos started turning more to opium after income from marijuana trafficking dropped, apparently because of legalisation of the drug in some U.S. states.

After paying local farmers to grow opium poppies in the rough mountains around Iguala, the gang warehoused and shipped the opium out to other regions to be refined, the official said.

He said: 'They stockpiled the paste; they sell it to other criminal organisations.'

The cartel forces Mexican farmers to grow illegal drugs instead of legal crops according to investigators

Meanwhile, Mexican security forces have
arrested the wife of one of the country's most wanted drug
cartel bosses, Servando Gomez, authorities in the violent
western state of Michoacan said on Wednesday.

A spokeswoman for state prosecutors in Michoacan said Ana
Patino was caught on a highway inside Michoacan, where the gang
led by Gomez known as the Knights Templar has posed a major
security challenge to President Enrique Pena Nieto.

Patino was detained on a road connecting Mexico City with
the country's second biggest city Guadalajara, the spokeswoman
said, adding that she had no further details.

Pena Nieto launched an offensive against the Knights Templar
at the beginning of 2014, capturing or killing many of the
gang's leaders. However, Gomez, also known as 'La Tuta', has
eluded the government's attempts to capture him.

Until the crackdown in Michoacan in January, Gomez, 48, was
the most visible cartel boss in Mexico, appearing in a number of
videos posted online in which he sought to justify the gang's
actions. He even gave some interviews to international media.

Mexican media has reported that Patino was Gomez's first
wife, and the mother of several of his children. The spokeswoman
said it is not clear whether the two have stayed married.
