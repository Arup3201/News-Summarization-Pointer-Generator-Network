A great-grand-father died the day he turned 100 – as his family sang him Happy Birthday.

Sidney Doel had invited loved ones including some of his 14 great-grandchildren to lunch at his care home, in Plymouth, to mark the milestone. 

But as they waited for the meal he became unwell and died peacefully in bed as they crowded round to sing to him.

His death was so sudden that he did not even get to read his special card from the Queen, who sent him her best wishes.  His son Eric Doel, 56, said: ‘It was the nicest way for dad to go.’

Mr Doel was born in Plymouth on January 11, 1915 and lived with his father Charlie Doel, a Royal Marine, mother Edith Doel, and five siblings.

When he was 18 he joined the regular Army and served for 13 years, reaching the rank of corporal, before going on to serve in the Territorial Army.

His aptitude and courage during the Second World War won him four medals - the 1939-1945 Star, the Africa Star, the War Medal 1939-1945 and the Defence Medal. 

His daughter Shirley Kemp (pictured holding Mr Doel's card from the Queen) described him as a ‘perfect gentleman’ with a ‘wicked sense of humour’

He was even part of the team that prepared to invade Normandy on D-Day - only stopping after his glider crashed, leaving him seriously injured. He was awarded four medals for his service in the Second World War and was an Army boxing champion. 

His daughter Shirley Kemp described him as a ‘perfect gentleman’ with a ‘wicked sense of humour’.

She said: 'He was absolutely brilliant with me and my children and used to take us swimming. He was such a good man.

'He was a wonderful husband, a great dad and a great grandfather. He was just a content man.'
