Tesco's profits have fallen for the second year running as its rivals continue to eat into its market share, which is at a ten-year low.

Britain's biggest supermarket has today posted a six per cent fall in its pre-tax profits to £3.3billion in the past 12 months, down from £3.45billion a year earlier.

Tesco's like-for-like sales also fell three per cent in the fourth quarter of 2013/2014 - the sharpest drop for three years.

 like Aldi and Lidl for their weekly shop while also heading to higher 
end stores like Waitrose and Marks & Spencer to buy more luxury 
items.

Bad news: Tesco, the UK's biggest supermarket, has posted a six per cent drop in profit for the past year while like-for-like sales were also down

Tesco is still by far the biggest UK supermarket with 28.6 per of market share, but this is down from 29.7 per cent a year ago.

Asda had 17.4 per cent, Sainsbury's had 16.5 per cent and Morrisons had 11.1 per cent in the year ending March 30.

But all have faced a surge from competitors gobbling up customers, with Aldi's share of the market up from 3.4 per cent to 4.6 per cent in the past 12 months.

Waitrose had five per cent compared with 4.8 per cent last year, and Lidl also experienced strong growth in a record-breaking month and now accounts for 3.4 per cent of the market.

Today's results heap more pressure on Tesco
 boss Phil Clarke, amid reports his successors are already 
being lined up.

Investors are understood to have begun discussing potential replacements, with former Dixons boss John Browett linked to the post.

Finance director Laurie McIlwee quit earlier this month, amid reports of disagreements with Clarke over Tesco’s plans to turn round its falling profits.

Tesco admitted that it had done worse than expected amid increasingly tough competition, saying: 'Our performance in the year was not where we had planned it to be.'

Like-for-like sales for the year in the UK were down 1.4 per cent.

The supermarket warned that the challenging environment would continue in the current financial year.

Mr Clarke said: 'Our results today reflect the challenges we face in a trading environment which is changing more rapidly than ever before. We are determined to lead the industry in this period of change.'

The results round off another dismal year for Clarke since he succeeded Sir Terry Leahy as Tesco boss in 2011.

Clarke is in the midst of a £1billion turnaround plan, which was launched last year after the first fall in profits for nearly two decades.

He has seen Tesco’s share of the market slump to 28.6 per cent – its lowest level for nearly ten years – amid fierce competition from discounters Aldi and Lidl.

Sales over the crucial Christmas and New Year period fell 2.4 per cent.

The chief executive brushed off speculation about his future amid the continuing decline in performance.

He said: 'I have got no intention of going anywhere. All my waking hours are spent running Tesco. It's what I love. I'm going to see this thing through.'

Under pressure: Tesco's Chief Executive Philip Clarke is under renewed pressure today as shareholders called on him to quit

Tesco chief executive Philip Clarke has today been accused of 'dismantling' the legacy of his predecessor Sir Terry Leahy as shareholders demanded he resigns.

One top 20 shareholder said that Mr Clarke, who took over three years ago, 'has got his strategy wrong' as the supermarket giant's profits fell for the second year running.

Tesco has invested £1billion revamping stores and cutting prices in a bid to kick-start growth in its domestic market.

But it has lost market share, and issued its first profit warning in 20 years, heaping huge pressure on Mr Clarke and his judgment.

'Clarke should go. Sir Terry Leahy was one of the great leaders and his legacy has been undermined. Clarke has shown he is the wrong person for the job. He has got the strategy wrong,' a top 20 investor told the Financial Times.

'Tesco should have realised the threat from the discounters and acted at least 18 months ago. I fear it is now too late. Morrison plans to slash its prices, but Tesco is not cutting its prices on the same scale. That is a mistake. Clarke is simply not of the same calibre as Sir Terry and I can't see him turning things around, which is why it is time for him to go'.

Clarke has already hinted that he has only a few more years left at the supermarket himself.

Despite his two past predecessors remaining as chief executive for more than a decade each, Clarke said last month: ‘You only have a job like this for a few years.’
