An armed gang who forced their way into a jeweller’s shop had to smash their way back out when the quick-thinking owner activated the security shutters, trapping them inside. 

The raid was caught on CCTV as three intruders, armed with a machete, a sledgehammer, and a baseball bat, targeted the premises in the middle of the day.

In the footage the trio can be seen forcing their way into family-run The Gold Shop on in Dudley Hill, Bradford, West Yorkshire, as the owner, two members of staff and a customer flee to a panic room.

Armed: The three armed men can be seen running towards The Gold Shop in Bradford, West Yorkshire, with weapons in their hands

Violent: One of the robbers uses his sledgehammer to smash his way into the jeweller's shop - the other two were armed with a machete and a baseball bat

Prepared: The armed men, who covered their faces and wore hoods, raise their weapons as they storm into The Gold Shop on Wakefield Road, Dudley Hill, Bradford, West Yorkshire

The raiders, who are all disguised, are captured leaping over the counters, using their weapons to smash glass cabinets and stuffing jewellery into a bag, before they realise the shutters have come down.

They then frantically batter the metal doors to make their escape.

Appearing at Bradford Crown Court yesterday, one of the gang, Liam Benson, 30, was sentenced by Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC to eight years imprisonment.

As the CCTV images show, the three men targeted the jewellery shop at 11.40am on May 23 this year.

A Golf car, which had been stolen and featured false plates, pulled up outside the shop, and the men wearing tracksuits and with their heads covered, got out.

Wrecking the place: The robbers smashed several glass display cases to grab the jewellery inside

Quick-thinking: The owner, two members of staff and a customer fled to a secure room ahead of the gang gaining access to the store

The gang smashed their way through the doors to gain entry, but the owner, Maurice Willan, managed to activate the SmartWater system and the roller shutters, sealing the robbers inside.

The raiders, who were inside the premises for just two and a half minutes, escaped with jewellery and watches worth more than £100,000, which has not been recovered.

Benson, of Third Avenue, Rothwell, Leeds, pleaded guilty to robbery at an earlier hearing at Bradford Crown Court.

Mr Willan welcomed the sentence and revealed he has since spent £15,000 on extra security, including steel doors and bullet-proof glass.

He said: 'It was horrible watching these people smashing up my property. I felt helpless. 

Trapped: But when they attempted to leave the way they'd come, the robbers discovered the owner had activated an alarm system and rollershutters

Smashing their way out: One of the gang members uses his sledgehammer to smash his way out of the shop

Trying to escape: The robber with the sledgehammer can seen bending to his knees to try and lift up the shutter

'We could hear all the banging and smashing, and we couldn’t do anything.

'It makes me even more determined to do what I am doing. You can’t let these people win.'

Detective Constable Dean Smith said: 'Liam Benson did not think twice about using a weapon to steal high-value items.

'This was a well-planned offence, and it has caused considerable distress to the victim and the witnesses involved.

'The custodial sentence given to Benson sends a very strong message that such crimes will be investigated thoroughly, and those who commit them will be identified and will be prosecuted.'

Three other men have been bailed pending forensic inquiries in connection with the incident.

Only way out: The robber is forced to slowly crawl out on his belly underneath a small gap in the shutter
