A police chase has ended in dramatic scenes with a stolen vehicle crashing over the side of a cliff and plunging toward a beach.

Police were alerted to the car with reports of a stolen Holden Barina driving erratically through the McLaren Vale are at about 11am on Sunday.

But when they began pursuing the vehicle, it lost control and rolled partially over a cliff overlooking Moana Beach, reports Nine News.

Road patrol officers first spotted the stolen Barina on the Esplanade at Moan, East of Adelaide, and pursued them soon after.

As police gained on the driver, he spun out of control, hurtling over a kerb and over a cliff that overlooks the beach. 

The driver suffered leg injuries and had to be hauled to safety by firefighters. He has since been arrested and is being questioned by police. 

It comes as news of a stolen car bursting through the doors of a Melbourne Village Cinema at early on Sunday morning,  reversed twice into an ATM machine then driving away. 

While nothing was stolen, police say it was a failed effort to steal money from the ATM
