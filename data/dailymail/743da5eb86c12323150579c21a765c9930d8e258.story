Dozens of Satanists gathered for a ritual 'black mass' yesterday - but hundreds more turned up to protest against the event. 

The satanic mass, which is thought to have included a ritual denouncing Jesus Christ and stomping on and spitting on a wafer representing the consecrated Host, was held at the Oklahoma City Civic Center.

It was led by Adam Daniels, a self-avowed devil worshipper who fronts the Dakhma of Angra Mainyu Syndicate. He claimed the purpose of the mass was to de-program people from the influences of Catholicism and Christianity.

'We've had  protests before, but I've never seen anything of this magnitude,' said a civic center spokesperson

Roughly 40 people assembled at the small theater at the bottom of the civic center to participate in the 'black mass'.

Meanwhile, around 1,200 Roman Catholics crowded into St. Francis of Assisi Church to hear a holy hour prayer service led by Archbishop Paul S. Coakely, Fox News reported.

Those who could not find space in the sanctuary filled an adjacent gym and cafeteria area, while roughly 400 others gathered outside to hear the service piped through speakers.

Archbishop Coakley told protesters that Oklahoma City had been targeted by 'dark forces,' but added that Christians 'know that Christ conquered Satan. The war has been won, Christ has conquered, though skirmishes will continue until Christ comes to reign forever.'

The service was followed by a procession to the Civic Center, where protesters from around the region had gathered to demonstrate against the Satanic ritual.

Prior to the event, Mr Daniels told the Tulsa World that when his Oklahoma City-based Satanic group conducts the black mass in private, it involves sex, urine and nudity.

But Mr Daniels insisted that the Civic Center ceremony would tone down those elements to comply with state law. 

'This is not a game. It's very serious to us,' he said. 'My devil is an equal anti-cosmic spirit that is the antithesis to what most call God.

'If you call chaos, freedom and self-service evil, then I'm one wicked individual. … I'm no more evil than a lion who eats a gazelle.'

Mr Daniels said the mass wound begin with music by the band God in a Machine, followed by a lecture on the purpose of the black mass and a ritual denouncing Jesus Christ and swearing allegiance to the devil. 

Officials at the civic center said that under the U.S. Constitution, Satanists have the same right as any other group to rent facilities in the city

The ritual would also involve stomping on and spitting on a wafer, representing the host. The plan was to conclude the mass with a reverse exorcism, casting the Holy Spirit out of the person.

Jennifer McClintock, a spokeswoman for the civic center, told the newspaper that the city has received thousands of communications from people opposed to the black mass, although they cannot be sure how many are duplicates.

'We've had some protests before, but I've never seen anything quite of this magnitude,' she said.

But despite the uproar over the service, city officials said they would not block the ritual from going ahead because the Civic Center is a public building.

Hundreds turned out to protest against the ritual satanic mass in Oklahoma Civic Center

They said that under the U.S. Constitution, Satanists have the same right as any other group to rent facilities in the city.

'A city-owned civic center for rent cannot, in effect, censor unpopular speech by refusing to rent to unpopular speakers. This is nothing new,' explained KSN legal analyst, Dan Monnat. 'Unpopular free speech is permitted under the Constitution, so long as it is not otherwise breaking the law.'

Mr Daniels, who has been involved with Satanist for around 14 years, told the Tulsa World that he was not upset about the outcry across the state and nation against what he is doing.

'We're glad that we have this opportunity to expose these people's self-righteous behavior,' he said.
