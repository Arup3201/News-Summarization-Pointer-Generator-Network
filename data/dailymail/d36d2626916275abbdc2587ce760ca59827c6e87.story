Computer-generated models of individual patients helping doctors map the progression of diseases and test the outcome of potential treatments could revolutionise  the NHS, scientists have claimed.

A team of academics at the University of Sheffield are working on cutting-edge technology to allow medics tailor the use of treatment and drugs to each case.

The work, due to be showcased at the university tomorrow, is being touted as a potential saviour to the struggling NHS.

The pioneering technology could replace clinical trials currently taking place in vitro - in a test tube, and those in vivo - in a living organism.

New technology, which is being pioneered at the University of Sheffield and creates computer-generated models of individual patients could revolutionise the NHS, helping doctors map the progression of diseases and test the potential outcome of treatments

The Virtual Physiological Human Project study aims to offer a better healthcare system with more personalised treatment plans, where results of various procedures can be potentially predicted in advance

The new method, in silico, allows scientists to build a sophisticated computer simulation model from a patient's own personal data.

Known as the Virtual Physiological Human Project, the study aims to offer a better healthcare system with more personalised treatment plan, where results can potentially be predicted in advance.

Pioneered at the university's Insigneo Institute for in silico Medicine, the technology models and simulates human physiology and 
disease processes, to improve outcomes in cancer, heart disease, brain 
surgery and many other conditions.

The ultimate aim of the project is to build a complete computerised model of the human body with a view to predicting patients' future health status.

Insigneo Director Professor Marco 
Viceconti of the University’s Department of Mechanical Engineering said: 'Can you imagine weather forecasting without computers nowadays?

More than 0 academics and clinicians are already developing computer simulations of disease processes that can be used directly in clinical practice to improve diagnosis and treatment

'In the
 same way that computers revolutionised weather forecasting, in silico 
medicine is bringing computers at the heart of healthcare; they will 
make possible to individualise the treatment, improve the care, and 
reduce the costs.'

At the Institute, more than 80 academics and 
clinicians are already developing computer simulations of disease 
processes that can be used directly in clinical practice to improve 
diagnosis and treatment.

Dr Keith McCormack who works on the project, highlighted the importance of the research. He said: 'Candidly, without in silico medicines (computer simulated), organiasations like the NHS will be unable to cope with demand'

Dr Keith McCormack who leads business development at the Institute said: ‘What we are working on here will be vital to the future of healthcare.

‘Pressures are mounting on health and treatment resources worldwide.

'Candidly, without in silico medicines (computer simulated), organiasations like the NHS will be unable to cope with demand.

'We're delighted that the Sheffied team is leading the way with this research. This is a real breakthrough for patients'

- Dr Julian Gunn, Consultant Cardiologist at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals

'The Virtual Physiological Human will act as a software-based laboratory for experimentation and treatment that will save huge amounts of time and money and lead to vastly superior treatment outcomes.’ 

Dr Julian Gunn, a Consultant Cardiologist
 at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and a Senior 
Lecturer at the University of Sheffield’s Department of Cardiovascular 
Science, said: 'Heart disease remains one of the world’s biggest 
killers, so we’re delighted that the Sheffield team is leading the way 
with this research.

'Any patient with coronary heart disease who 
has an angiogram can, in the future, have a computerised assessment of 
the significance of their disease.

'This will enable the cardiologist or 
surgeon to know where to place a bypass graft or stent, without any 
further tests, so this is a real breakthrough for patients.

Dr Julian Gunn, a Consultant Cardiologist at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: 'We're delighted that the Sheffield team is leading the way with this research...This is a real breakthrough for patients'

'The 
technology will further improve the diagnosis, reducing the need for 
some patients to have more invasive tests afterwards.

'It will also help 
doctors decide which arteries need treatment - even which bits of which 
arteries - and will guide therapy.'

A prototype computer system capable 
of detecting which heart patients need treatment is already in use in 
the Sheffield region.

It works by creating a 3-D model of the coronary 
arteries during an angiogram - where multiple X-rays of the arteries are
 taken - and reduces the need for further invasive tests and procedures.

Dr McCormack, (pictured), added: 'The Virtual Physiological Human will act as a software-based laboratory for experimentation and treatment that will save huge amounts of time and money and lead to vastly superior treatment outcomes'

When complete the virtual human will be the most sophisticated application of computing technology in healthcare.

A showcase of the work to date due to take place tomorrow in Sheffield will demonstrate the role the technology could play in treating diseases like Parkinson’s Disease, pulmonary disease and coronary artery disease.

The technology could also be used in managing the care of osteoporosis sufferers by using models of the patient’s body to chart disease progress and predict fracture risk.

The Insigneo Institute leading the work is a collaborative between the Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and the University of Sheffield.

The programme is backed by European Commission funding.
