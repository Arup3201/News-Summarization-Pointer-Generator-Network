It was built to be an icon of communist achievement - and to reach a towering height of 440 metres.

But the building was never finished and it has become iconic for another reason. For the Yekaterinburg TV Tower is believed to be the tallest incomplete structure in the world.

Construction work began on the tower in 1983 but in 1991 the project came to a dramatic halt with the collapse of the USSR.

The tower - which now stands at around 220 metres - has a slight lean due to engineering mistakes made in its construction.

But according to kuriositas.com the list does not mean the tower is due to topple over at any point in the near future. 

It is known by the city's residents as the 'fun tower' or the 'suicide tower'. Until the year 2000 it was illegally used for buildering and BASE jumping but after several fatal accidents, it was sealed off.

Local politicians hope the tower, which has 26 floors and no lift, meaning anyone using it must climb up the concrete stairs, can still be renovated.

Construction works started in 1983 but were halted at the beginning of the 1990s with the collapse of the USSR
