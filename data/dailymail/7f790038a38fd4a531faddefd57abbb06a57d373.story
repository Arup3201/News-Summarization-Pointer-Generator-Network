Promising PR executive Faizel Vohra, 28, died after being hit by rush-hour traffic on the M6 motorway in Lancashire

A newly-married public relations worker who was worried about his marriage died after stepping into traffic on a busy motorway.

Faizel Vohra, 28, had been married just three months when it emerged that a third party was involved and the relationship between him and wife, Zaheda, crumbled, an inquest into his death heard.

The account manager from Preston, named in an industry list of top PRs under 30, parked his VW Golf on the hard shoulder of the M6 near his Lancashire home town before deliberately stepping in front of a lorry.

He was hit by several vehicles, suffering multiple injuries, and died at the scene, Preston and East Lancashire Coroner's Court heard.

When Mr Vohra's mobile phone was recovered, it contained text messages between himself and his wife which revealed a third party had been involved.  The messages indicated that their brief marriage had broken down, and there was 'a clear sense of upset'.

The inquest heard that Mr Vohra, who wrote a food blog which featured pictures of him with contestants from the Great British Bake Off, was a high-flying PR executive with a bright future.

The Lancaster University graduate married in November 2013 but his boss at Leyland-based MTJ Associates, Anne Jackson, noticed that by February this year his mood had changed.

'He was by nature a quiet, very respectful and very serious employee,' she told the inquest.  'But I just noticed he was a little bit more pre-occupied.

She said that on 10 February, the day before his death, she had held a meeting with Mr Vohra to see if she could help him after he said he had family issues 'to sort out'.

Ms Jackson added: 'He was very, very upset, physically shaking. It was out of character for him.'

But she said that he did not disclose what his problem was.

She said: 'I didn't want to make him any more upset. Very shortly after the meeting he picked up a call from a journalist who has asked him how his weekend was and he said "Yeah great", and he was back to his old self.

'I offered him more time off, and any support, but he said no. He sent an email after and said thank you for your support and kindness.'

The inquest was told that at around 6pm the following day, drivers saw a man stepping out onto the M6 motorway near Preston.

In a statement read to the court, wagon driver Christopher Gore, told how he swerved into another lane to avoid Mr Vohra.

Another truck driver, Stephen Foley, said he noticed the car with the bonnet up parked in the hard shoulder.

He saw Mr Vohra make two attempts to step into the traffic before stepping out for a third time in front of Carl Swindlehurst, who was driving a lorry and trailer at 56mph.

Mr Swindlehurst told the inquest: 'One minute he was on the hard shoulder, and the next in front of me. He must have moved into the lane when I was very close. There wasn't any time for me to react.

'In a HGV you can't see what is immediately in front. I remember thinking he must have got out of the way.

'He would have had time to leap out of the way. Then I heard a loud thud and I shouted out in shock.'

The court heard that Mr Vohra was hit by the passenger side of the lorry before he was struck by a number of cars and another HGV.

Jonathon Norris, who had been overtaking Mr Swindlehurst in his van, said that Mr Vohra, 'took two steps out in front of the car and turned towards the wagon.'

He added: 'He just took two steps out, I heard the bang.'

Mr Vohra's Golf was examined but there was no reason for it to have been on the hard shoulder, and the hearing was told Mr Swindlehurst had 'no opportunity to avoid' the collision.

PC Craig Booth said he had read recent texts between Mr and Mrs Vohra but the officer was told by Preston coroner, Simon Jones, that he was not to go into specific details.

PC Booth said: 'It became clear that there was a third person involved... There is a clear sense of upset, a relationship breakdown, it's clear from the texts. A relationship breakdown between Faizel and Zaheda and a third person involved.'

Recording a verdict of suicide, the coroner said: 'We have heard evidence from his employer in regards to Faizel's demeanour and in particular out-of-character behaviour the day before his death.

'He was described as "very, very upset" and "physically shaking", but unwilling to share with her what the issue was.

'There is evidence of difficulty of the relationship between him and his wife. What is clear, is that there were issues going on with his life that were causing him considerable upset.'
