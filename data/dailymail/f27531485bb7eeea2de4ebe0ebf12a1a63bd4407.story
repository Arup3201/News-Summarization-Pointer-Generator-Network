Kate and William went ‘selfie’ crazy yesterday, much to the delight of several lucky well-wishers.

On a walkabout in Sydney, they posed for snaps with fans. Nina Kiwarkis, who is waiting for a heart and lung transplant, was lucky enough to get photographs with both the Duke and the Duchess.

Miss Kiwarkis, 52, said: ‘I thought William would say no but he didn’t. He wished me well.’

An earlier selfie from the tour, of Kate high-fiving a youngster in Christchurch on Monday, has already been retweeted hundreds of times with the hashtag #besteverselfie.

The couple arrived in Australia yesterday with eight-month-old Prince George who was sporting a white smocked romper suit with leather pre-walking shoes.

Waving his arms and kicking his legs, 
the little prince appeared to reach out and shake the hand of members of
 the official welcoming party and took a keen interest in the posy of 
flowers Kate was presented with.

Once the official welcomes were over, it was the turn of George’s Spanish-born nanny, Maria Teresa Turrion Borrallo, to carry him.

It is the first time Miss Turrion Borrallo has been photographed holding George and she placed him carefully in a car seat inside an official limousine.

The prince was given his own police escort to Admiralty House, the official residence in Kirribilli of the Governor-General – the Queen’s official representative in Australia – where the royal party will stay for five days.

Meanwhile William and Kate travelled to Sydney Opera House for an official reception to welcome them to Australia. Thousands of members of the public gathered to catch a glimpse of the royal couple.

Well-wishers complimented Kate on her elegant yellow dress – although the Duchess confided to one onlooker: ‘William said I look like a banana.’

After a walkabout it was time for a boat ride across the harbour to Admiralty House, where Kate and William were reunited with their son.

In his mother’s arms once more, George looked delighted as he was presented with a giant cuddly toy wombat by the Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove.
