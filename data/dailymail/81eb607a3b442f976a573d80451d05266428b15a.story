A shock poll revealed less than two weeks before the referendum shows Scottish voters are leaning towards Alex Salmond's Yes campaign for independence.

The study revealed 51 per cent will vote to breakaway from the United Kingdom on September 18, overturning a  22-point lead for the Better Together Campaign.

It comes after Alistair Darling failed to impress voters during the second of two  heated debates with the SNP leader on August 25.

A shock new poll revealed just 11 days before the referendum shows 51 per cent of voters are backing Alex Salmond's Yes campaign 

The poll, carried out by YouGov for The Sunday Times, found 49 per cent of the Scottish electorate will safely vote No when asked whether the country should leave the union.

It is the first time the pollsters revealed a Yes campaign lead, despite others suggesting just that in previous months. 

According to the data, 35 per cent of Scottish voters who previously supported Labour's pro-union campaign are deserting it - more than double the 18 per cent reported last month. 

The under-forties, working class and female voters are also reported to have swayed towards independence. 

The two point gap falls within an error margin for polls, with some experts considering such a small difference too close to call.

The new data puts the Yes campaign in the lead for the first time with just two points now separating the two sides 

It comes after Alistair Darling failed to impress viewers in the second of two televised debates with the SNP leader 

Last month the Yes campaign enjoyed a surge in support following the second of two televised debates between the former Chancellor and First Minister of Scotland. 

A snap poll taken after the August 25 debate revealed 71 per cent of viewers considered the SNP leader the victor following a string of stinging put-downs over Darling's concern for currency. 

Many remained turned-off by Salmond's aggressive nature however, with leader shouting over his opponent more than once during the BBC broadcast.
