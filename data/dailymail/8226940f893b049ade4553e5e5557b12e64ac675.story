The shocking photos were revealed for the first time amid claims the star may have suffered abuse in the years before he died in April this year.

The National Enquirer reports that Rooney, of Westlake, California, was treated for the cut to his head in December 2011.

A month later, in January 2012 - two years before his death - he was pictured with a missing tooth and apparent facial contusions.

According to the National Enquirer, some members of the star's family are preparing to hand a file over to law enforcement chiefs which they believe may explain his death. 

In the Enquirer's article, Rooney's eighth wife Jan Chamberlin vehemently denies any suggestion that she may have abused the star.

During his career Rooney made 361 films. But his estate was reported to have been worth just $18,000 when he died

She is quoted in a statement as saying: 'I deny each and every allegation that I mistreated Mickey. We were married for almost 40 years and I would never harm him.'  

During his 80-year movie career Rooney made 361 films. But his estate was reported to have been worth just $18,000 when he died.

The actor rests next to Hollywood legends including Rudolph Valentino, Douglas Fairbanks, Jayne Mansfield, and Charlie Chaplin, in Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

The Enquirer reports that the two sides of Rooney's family held separate funerals on April 19.

At the time of his death, the actor had been living with his stepson Mark and Mark's wife Charlene.

In September 2011, it was reported that Rooney had filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Superior Court that accused his stepson Christopher Aber and Mr Aber's wife Christina and others of charges including elder abuse and fraud over the previous decade.

A court judgment was later reached which appeared to have brought the three-year legal row to a conclusion and in which, according to the Hollywood Reporter, the abuse allegations were dropped.

The judgment said that Rooney's conservator and Aber 'have agreed to resolve all the matters of controversy between them and have consented to the terms of this judgment'.

Aber was asked to pay $2.865m, it has been reported - but the ruling was not enforced. The Hollywood Reporter said that Christopher Aber and his wife admitted no wrongdoing in the court documents.
