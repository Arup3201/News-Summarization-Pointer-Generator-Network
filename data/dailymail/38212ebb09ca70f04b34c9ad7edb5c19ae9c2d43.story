A fragment of a child's skull dating back some 1.5million years offers some of the earliest evidence that early humans were hunters who ate meat regularly, scientists say.

The piece of bone discovered in the Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, has signs of nutritional deficiencies commonly caused by a lack of meat in its owner's diet, suggesting early man needed meat to thrive.

The discovery by a team of researchers led by Manuel Domínguez-Rodrigo from Complutense University, Madrid, suggests early human ancestors began eating meat much earlier in history than previously believed.

The skull fragment identified is thought to belong to a child somewhat younger than two and shows bone lesions that commonly result from a lack of B-vitamins in the diet.

Previous studies have suggested that early hominids ate meat, but whether it was a regular part of their diet or only consumed sporadically was not certain.

Now, the researchers suggest that the bone lesions present in this skull fragment provide support for the idea that meat-eating was common enough that not consuming it could lead to anaemia.

Nutritional deficiencies such as anemia are most common at weaning, when children's diets change drastically.

The research suggest that the child may have died at a period when he or she was starting to eat solid foods lacking meat.

Alternatively, if the child still 
depended on the mother's milk, the mother may have been nutritionally 
deficient for lack of meat.

B vitamins are a group of water-soluble vitamins which play vital roles in healthy cell metabolism.

Once regarded as a single vitamin, later research showed they are distinct chemicals which often coexist in the same foods.

B vitamins are found in whole unprocessed food, with processed carbohydrates like sugar and white flour containing much less than their unprocessed counterparts.

Lack of B vitamins causes a range of problems ranging from acne to anaemia.

Good sources include whole grains, potatoes, bananas and lentils. But vitamin B12 in particular is only available from animal sources, making deficiency a concern for those unable or unwilling to eat meat.

Both
 cases imply that 'early humans were hunters, and had a physiology 
adapted to regular meat consumption at least 1.5 million years ago', say
 the researchers.

The 
evidence that early man ate meat as an integral part of his diet comes 
as leading scientists are beginning to warn that the entire world may 
have to become almost entirely vegetarian to handle spiralling 
populations.

Researchers
 from the Stockholm International Water institute warned in August that 
animal-based food will have to drop to just 5 per cent of our total 
calories by 2050.

'There
 will not be enough water available on current croplands to produce food
 for the expected 9 billion population in 2050 if we follow current 
trends and changes towards diets common in western nations,' the 
researchers warned. 

It
 is believed that if current population growth continues, there could be
 an additional 2billion people alive by 2050. Humans currently get about
 20 per cent of their protein from animal-based products.

The latest findings were reported in a paper published yesterday in the open access journal PLoS ONE.
