A woman is suing a hospital's psychiatric ward after claiming she was diagnosed as being delusional because she correctly told doctors Barack Obama follows her on Twitter.

Kam Brock, from Long Island, has filed a suit at Manhattan Federal Court saying she was wrongly told she had bipolar disorder and was forced to endure eight days at the mental facility at Harlem Hospital.

The Jamaican-born 32-year-old also says that doctors didn't believe her when she told them that the President followed her on Twitter, even though her account, @AkilahBrock, shows he does.

According to the New York Daily News, a treatment plan for Ms Brock at the hospital states: 'Objective: Patient will verbalize the importance of education for employment and state that Obama is not following her on Twitter.'

Ms Brock, an Astoria Bank worker, ended up in the psychiatric ward last September when the NYPD seized her BMW car as they suspected she had been smoking marijuana.

A day later she went to an NYPD station to retrieve her car, and claims police put her in handcuffs and in an ambulance after she became 'emotional'.

She told the Daily News: 'Next thing you known, the police held onto me, the doctor stuck me with a needle and I was knocked out.'

The president, pictured, currently follows more than 640,000 different accounts on the social media website 

According to her lawyer Michael Lamsoff, she was forced to endure injections and group therapy for eight days before she was finally allowed to go home.

Both the NYPD and Harlem Hospital have declined to comment on the case.

President Obama was one of the first politicians to harness the power of Twitter and currently follows more than 640,000 different accounts.

These include both celebrities and ordinary people.

In 2012, a picture posted of him hugging his wife Michelle after winning a second term in office, with the caption 'four more years', became the most retweeted post of all time.
