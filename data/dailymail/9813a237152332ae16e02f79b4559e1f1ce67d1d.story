Nick Clegg will this week drive a new wedge between the Liberal Democrats and David Cameron with a staunch defence of immigration to the UK.

The Deputy Prime Minister will aim to contrast Liberal Democrats’ belief in the benefits brought by immigrants with what his aides described as Tory ‘rhetoric’ on the issue.

In a speech, he will unveil a £1 million plan to crack down on businesses paying migrants less than the minimum wage, by pledging to increase  a 93-strong compliance unit by a third.

Mr Clegg’s message will also be coupled with confirmation of a crackdown on illegal immigrants using sham marriages to stay in  the UK, as part of a ‘firm but fair, tough but  smart’ system.

But Lib Dem sources said he would strike a very different tone from Mr Cameron, who last month announced plans to close the door on ‘soft-touch Britain’ by restricting jobless EU migrants’  rights to out-of-work benefits.

A source said: ‘We agreed with that benefit crackdown but Nick will be stressing about how we are an open, tolerant and diverse society.  When it comes to immigration, we need to restore trust in the system.

‘Nick has repeatedly said he thinks immigration is a net positive for the country and for society and our priority is to maintain that open, tolerant and diverse society but also clamp on the abuses.’

Mr Clegg’s intervention comes amid rising Tory and Labour fears about the impact of the UK Independence Party at next year’s Election.
