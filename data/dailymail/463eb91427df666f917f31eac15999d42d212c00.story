Technology: Sussex Police wants to equip bobbies with tablet computers like iPads so they can work on the move

A police force which is cutting 500 front-line jobs to save money is issuing officers with iPad-style tablets so they can do their paperwork on the move.

Sussex Police is planning to equip their officers with the tablet computers so they can fill in their crime reports while they are out and about - instead of being stuck in the office.

The force has refused to reveal how 
much the devices would cost or how many would be given out, but the bill
 could run into millions of pounds if the majority of officers were 
given them.

Users will have access to emails, custom police apps and outside internet sites such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

The move, which is subject to a trial period, comes as the force plans to chop 500 front-line jobs to save £50million from its budget by 2015.

Many officers have already been made to resign after they reached 30 years service.

Tablets have become the must-have 
gadget over the last few years with the arrival of the iPad, with prices
 varying from a few hundred pounds each to more than £1,000 for top of the range models complete with a host of 
apps.

For example, if the force gave the 
£999 Blackberry PlayBook Tablet to all its 3,200 officers the bill could
 be greater than £3million.

A report written in the name of chief 
constable Martin Richards says 'Sussex Police will be at the forefront 
of technology with the tablet as an operating platform.

'This technology has a potential to 
create a truly mobile solution for police officers at a lower cost when 
compared with laptops and PDAs.'

Sussex Police HQ in Lewes: The force will trial the tablets in the Lewes area and hope to role out the technology to the rest of the force later on

The report adds that officers will be 'able to complete crime reports and witness statements on the move'.

A force spokeswoman said that officers 
would be able to go online 'for legitimate purposes' only, adding that 
there were 'policies and procedures in place to monitor for any improper
 use'.

The force’s neighbourhood policing 
scrutiny committee is expected to approve the start of a trial of 
between ten and 50 of the tablets when it meets this week.

The trial, which will be carried out 
by teams in the Lewes district, will run for three months and could then
 be expanded to other areas of the force.

The force has refused to reveal 
the brands and models of the devices that would be considered but said 
that the trial will cost £25,000.

A spokeswoman said the majority of 
this was for the design, development and setting up the trial but the 
public could not be given any more details for reasons of 'commercial 
confidentiality'.

Chief Insp Jason Tingley, the force’s 
district commander for Lewes, said 'Response officers have seen the 
mobile tablets and are very keen to start using them as soon as they 
can.

'This is an exciting development and 
the pilot at the end of this month will test the usability of the 
devices and we hope will provide a new and more agile way of working.'

It's not the first time Sussex Police have been in the press. The force has come under fire for its decision to recruit five spin doctors while slashing frontline officers.

In March the force claimed they were advertising for new 
posts to maintain their ‘popular website’, ‘teach officers to use 
Twitter’ and sell the idea of cuts to its workforce.

And, its communications manager hit the headlines earlier this year when she was caught using her official Twitter account to Tweet pictures of cakes in the office.
