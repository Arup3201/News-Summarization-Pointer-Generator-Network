The Crimean crisis has been described as the 'biggest threat to European security' since the Cold War.

But it seems many spectators have been more preoccupied admiring the attractive blonde who was appointed the new Crimean attorney general last week.

Natalia Poklonskaya was introduced to the world in a press conference on March 19 following the deadly shooting of a Ukrainian soldier by a Russia-backed Crimean self-defence forces member.

With many eyes turned to Ukraine, Poklonskaya’s face was plastered across international media and within hours the interview - which was all in Russian - went viral around the world.

'Well, now we know the reason why Putin wants Crimea,' one commentator wrote.

Some people appear to be so taken with the prosecutor, they are creating manga images and anime fan art inspired by her.

The amateur artists have taken footage of Poklonskaya from the press conference and transformed her into a battle-ready heroine.

Alongside one picture, a blogger wrote: 'Used properly, beauty is indeed a powerful weapon' while another wrote 'beauty saves the world'.

Poklonskaya is likely to be featured in the news frequently in coming weeks in her role as Crimean attorney general as tensions in region heighten

But the drawings were quickly 
followed up with real-life revealing images of the 33-year-old in a 
little black dress and bright red heels after they were discovered on 
social media sites.

They are now also going viral, bringing pro-Russian Poklonskaya further fans from around the globe.

Before her appointment, Poklonskaya worked as a senior lawyer at the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office in the Ukrainian capital Kiev as wellas Crimea's Simferopol office, according to Rossiyskaya Gazeta, the official Russian government newspaper.

She is staunchly pro-Russian and described the Ukrainian authorities as 'devils from the ashes'.

She has also voiced criticism of the opposition protests in Ukraine and described the change of government in Kiev as an 'anti-constitutional coup'.

The Ukrainian government has launched a criminal case against her and stripped her of the civil service rank of 'counsellor of justice'.
