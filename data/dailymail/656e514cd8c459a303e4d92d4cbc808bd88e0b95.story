A mother suffering from an often debilitating bowel disease has written a no-holds-barred open letter to the cruel bullies who have tutted at her for using disabled toilet facilities. 

Sam Cleasby, 33, from Sheffield, suffers from Ulcerative Colitis, which causes ulcers to form inside the digestive system. 

Despite her normal outward appearance, the mother-of-three can often be left in huge discomfort by bleeding, diarrhoea, and fatigue, symptoms made worse by unkind remarks from unwitting tormentors.

Mum-of-three Sam Cleasby, 33, wrote an open letter addressing  her tormentors on her So Bass Ass blog. The post has received two million hits so far and hundreds of supportive comments - including apologies 

Ms Cleasby wrote the emotionally-charged post entitled 'Dear lady who tutted at me using the disabled loos...' after she was left 'humiliated, angry and upset' by the reactions of other women when she used the disabled facility at a public bathroom.

The post documenting the harrowing encounter has gone viral, attracting around two million hits and supportive comments - and even some apologies - from across the globe.

Sam documents her story about living with the disease in her wittily-titled blog 'So Bad Ass'.

She writes: 'When using disabled toilets, I’ve had women tutting at me, nudging their friends or loudly questioning why I am using the bathroom when I am not disabled.' 

Beating the bullies: Sam uses her online posts on her blog, So Bad Ass, to document living with bowel disease. The mum-of-three says she's delighted her 'open letter' has raised awareness

The open letter has had a huge impact: Sam says: 'I regret not calling out the women who judged me at the time, but my letter has turned these bad incidents into something has made a difference to millions.'

She explains about what it's like to live with the condition before pouring scorn on those who've judged her: 'Having an invisible illness, such as Ulcerative Colitis, is a very isolating and embarrassing experience.

'I know you saw me running in, with my able bodied legs, my two working arms, without a wheelchair, without any visible sign of disability… and assumed I was showing guilt at blagging the disabled loos. The fact is that I have no bowel.'

She adds: 'Last week a supermarket cleaner laughed as she heard me using the toilet and then called to her friend: “OH MY GOD! You should hear the noise in there!"

'I was mortified, but more upset to know that my daughter, who was waiting outside heard her too.'

Addressing the woman directly, she says: 'Perhaps you could have stopped and heard me sobbing with pain because the acid in my stools has no way to be neutralised because I don’t have a large intestine and so opening my bowels actually burns my skin.'

No external signs: Sam feels she suffers more prejudice because people don't realise she has a disability. Her 'jpouch', which is similar to a colostomy bag, is often well hidden beneath her clothes

Sam has to wear a 'jpouch', an ileostomy bag (similar to a colostomy bag), after having her large colon removed. In a bid to raise awareness and help others suffering with the disease she has posed for scantily-clad images in a bid to break the taboo surrounding her illness.

People with Inflammatory Bowel Diseases, such as Ulcerative Colitis and Crohns disease have the right to use disabled toilets. 

She has since received messages from thousands of people, many with illnesses or disabilities that are not immediately seen telling their own horror stories at being judged unfairly by members of the public. But interestingly, Sam has also heard from some who admitted they had been the person doing the tutting.

'I have had a lot of apologies,' she says: 'People telling me they recognised themselves in my letter and would change their behaviour in future. That felt amazing, I regret not calling out the women who judged me at the time, but my letter has turned these bad incidents into something has made a difference to millions.'  

Dear lady who loudly tutted at me using the disabled loos,

I know you saw me running in, with my able bodied legs and all. You saw me opening the door with my two working arms. You saw me without a wheelchair. Without any visible sign of disability.

You tutted loudly as I rattled the handle with my hands that work perfectly and my able voice call to my kids that I’d be out in just a minute.

My lack of wheelchair may have suggested to you that I was some lazy cow who didn’t care. Some inconsiderate bitch who was using something I wasn’t entitled too. (I actually carry a card to explain that I’m entitled to and have a disability key if you’d have cared to ask). You may have seen my face blushing as I caught your eye and assumed I was showing guilt at blagging the disabled loos.

Living with a disease that people can't see: Sam uses her blog to highlight body image issues for bowel disease sufferers

The fact is that I have no bowel. I have a pouch formed from my small intestine which can’t handle volume and so I have to go to the toilet and poo several times a day. My lack of large intestine means that my stool is totally liquid as I have no means of absorbing the fluids in food and so its really hard to hold it when I need to go.

I sometimes have accidents which means a large toilet that has a sink right by me means I can clean myself up when things go awry.

I hate having to use the disabled loos as I have to deal with people like you staring, nudging, tutting. And whenever I can, I use the ladies toilets. Just so you know, disabled loos usually smell bad and don’t seem to be cleaned as often or as well as the ladies and so I wouldn’t choose this option unless totally necessary.

Whilst I’m at it, I’d like to address the cleaner in the supermarket ladies toilets I used this week. As I ran in, knees together, bursting through the door and running to the cubicle, I’m sorry that the noise of my (lack of) bowels made you burst out laughing.

I can actually take the sniggering as since I had a pouch made from my small intestine because my disease ridden colon was removed during surgery, the noise I make when I defecate is hilariously loud. Seriously, I get it. It’s comedic in it’s volume.

But before you ran outside the loos and called to your friend “OH MY GOD! You should hear the noise in there!!! I wouldn’t go in if I was you!!!!” Perhaps you could have noted my daughter who was waiting outside with our trolley because her mum had had to leave her stranded to run to the toilet. Perhaps you could have stopped and heard me sobbing with pain because the acid in my stools has no way to be neutralised because I don’t have a large intestine and so opening my bowels actually burns my skin.

Perhaps you both could have shown a little empathy, a little compassion, a little understanding.

Poo is funny. Disability is confusing.

I get that.

But humanity and care for fellow human beings is a choice.

To everyone else reading this, the next time you see someone who doesn’t “look disabled” using a toilet.

Or someone bursting through and crashing into the toilets noisily.

Take a moment. Remember that not all people who have the right to use disabled toilets are in a wheelchair. Some of us have a jpouch, a lot of us have an Ostomy bag that needs emptying and changing with the use of space, a sink and a bin. And even more of us just don’t want to shit our pants in public.

Think about the nearly 300,000 people in this country who have inflammatory bowel disease (not to mention the huge number of people with IBS!!!) who need to use the toilet urgently, noisily, smellily…

It’s an embarrassing enough thing to deal with before having to see disapproving looks or hear your laughs and jeering remarks.

Be kind yo…

Peace out

Sam xxxxx
