A woman smuggling cocaine into the United States was captured by authorities at New York City's Kennedy Airport.

Janisha Atkins, 33, a Jamaican national who now lives in New Haven, Connecticut, was arrested after officers found her carrying almost four pounds of cocaine with a street value of $64,000.

The narcotics were found inside her Chanel purse and two pairs of platform shoes.

Atkins was selected for examination by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers on Sept. 19 after arriving in NYC aboard a JetBlue flight from Montego Bay, Jamaica.

Officers immediately noticed a strong smell when they opened her suitcase that seemed to be coming from her Chanel purse and two pairs of platform shoes. 

The lining of the pocketbook and the heels of the shoes were probed further after officers noticed they felt 'unusually heavy.'

It was then they discovered a white powder inside that turned out to be cocaine.

Atkins admitted that she was aware the drugs were in her purse and shoes and was charged with importation of a controlled substance.

Big bust: The cocaine seized had an approximate street value of more than $64,000

According to CBP, the total weight of cocaine seized was approximately 3.7 lbs. with an approximate street value of more than $64,000. 

'This latest seizure demonstrates the vigilance of our CBP officers, and their excellence in detecting those who would try to smuggle these illegal substances,' said Robert E. Perez, Director, Field Operations New York. 

Atkins, who now faces federal narcotics smuggling charges, is being held without bail at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.

She also won't be getting her Chanel bag back, a loss of roughly $5,500 assuming it is a real Classic Flap Bag and not a fake.
