In was during that interview that Palin famously talked about Alaska's proximity to Russia and was unable to name a single magazine she read on a regular basis, instead telling Couric; 'Um, all of them, any of them that have been in front of me all these years.' 

Palin would later claim that Couric had a bias against her.
