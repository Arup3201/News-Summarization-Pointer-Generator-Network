The tragic tale of how the First World War's last victim died from his wounds 47 years after his brother was killed in the same conflict, it has emerged.

Jack and Walter Satterthwaite fought alongside one another on the Western Front until Jack was shot and killed in battle in April 1916.

His older brother Walter carried on in the trenches but was invalided out of the army after being severely wounded in the right leg a year later.

Although his limb was rendered permanently immobile he recovered to lead a normal life until he went into hospital due to increasing pain from his wartime wound.

He underwent surgery to amputate his left leg but died from severe blood loss and became the last casualty of the Great War.

His grandson, Brian Satterthwaite, has cherished a box of medals and photographs relating to the two brothers for years.

He has now made them available for an exhibition due to be held to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the start of the war in August.

Organisers of the event have digitally colourised one of the photos which show Sergeant Jack Satterthwaite and his platoon setting off for war at Letchworth train station, Hertfordshire.

The remarkable image shows the 20 men in their green uniforms holding their rifles on a sunny summer's day.

Jack Satterthwaite was killed in action in April 1916 and buried in France. His brother Walter was wounded the following year and invalided out of the army

Dan Hill, who is behind the Herts at War exhibition, said: 'Sadly, a family losing two sons in the war was not altogether uncommon.

'But the ordeal that the Satterthwaites endured at the time and the impact of the Great War so many years after the event serve to highlight the legacy of the conflict.

'With the centenary of the Great War fast approaching we are proud to share this story and feel that every previously unknown story that is told is a success for those who believe in the importance of remembrance and the preservation of our wartime history.'

Jack, who was born in 1891, worked for a printers and joined the local Territorial Army before the outbreak of war in 1914.

He was found to be a highly capable soldier, promoted to platoon sergeant and led men from his home town of Letchworth in the Hertfordshire Regiment in France.

One of his duties was to regularly write home to thank the residents of Letchworth for sending the men gifts.

Then in November 1915 older brother Walter joined his comrades on the Western Front and Jack found himself in command of his sibling.

On April 17, 1916 Jack was shot in the chest during fighting at Festubert in north west France and died of his wounds in hospital five days later aged 25.

His devastated parents, James and Alice, lived in daily fear for their other son Walter who remained fighting in France.

He won the Military Medal for bravery in the field before he was severely wounded in the right knee in 1917.

After leaving the army he was given a specially adapted motorised bicycle that allowed him to travel around, albeit with his immobile leg stretched out in front of him.

Brian Satterthwaite said he gave the medals to the exhibition because he wanted to 'help others learn about the Great War'

Tragically, 47 years after receiving the wound, Walter had to have it amputated, a procedure that led to his in 1963 aged 75.

His grandson Brian said: 'My grandfather never really spoke about the war or his brother, who died in France.

'My great uncle's death must have been very hard for the family but their view was "what's done is done". It was a very different time back then.

'He was very well known in the Letchworth area because of this bicycle he had and people used to say "there's a war hero going by".

'Because I was the oldest son, my family gave me my grandfathers' medals and also the medals of my great uncle.

'I have kept them all in a box in the wardrobe. If anything happened to me the medals would probably be sold off.

'I wanted the collection to go somewhere it could do some good and help others learn about the Great War which is why I have given them to the exhibition.'
