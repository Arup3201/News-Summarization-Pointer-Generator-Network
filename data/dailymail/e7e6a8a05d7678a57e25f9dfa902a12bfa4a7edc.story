Record numbers of British students are choosing American universities amid concerns over rising fees and the quality of degree courses.

More than 10,000 young people attended institutions in the United States - which offer generous scholarship schemes - during the 2013-14 academic year.

This was an eight per cent rise on 2012-13 - the largest year-on-year increase in a decade, according to a report released by the Institute for International Education (IIE) today.

UK undergraduates are particularly interested in studying for degrees overseas, with an 11 per cent increase in numbers in the US between 2012-13 and 2013-14.

These students - around 5,000 - applied in Autumn 2012, just as the first cohort of undergraduates were affected by tuition fees of up to £9,000-a-year.

There has been a 15 per cent rise in UK undergraduates heading to the US between 2008-9 and 2013-14.

The top five US universities hosting UK students in 2013-14 were Harvard, Columbia, New York, University of California Berkeley and Yale.

The findings will renew fears of a ‘brain drain’, with the tripling in tuition charges pushing some of the country’s brightest minds abroad.

Fees at top American institutions including Harvard, Princeton and Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) can be around £40,000 per year, but they offer generous financial aid.

US universities also provide sports scholarships, which can cut fees by as much as 75 per cent.

Experts believe that students are also attracted to the breadth of the liberal arts curriculum. They can take a range of subjects before specialising in their third year.

Meanwhile the US-UK Fulbright Commission, which promotes links between universities in both countries, saw a record 4,700 visitors to its annual US university undergraduate fair this autumn.

It has described a ‘tidal wave of increased interest in US study’ over recent years and said there was evidence this trend ‘is only gaining momentum’.

Jamie Dunn, spokeswoman for the US-UK Fulbright Commission, said: ‘Each year, we survey students as they apply for visas at the US Embassy, and year on year, some of the top reasons they cite are: the quality and number of US universities - there are over 4,000 to choose from, the chance to experience the vibrant American campus life and the more flexible liberal arts curriculum.’

She added: ‘The rise in tuition fees seems to have sparked this trend in British students crossing the pond for their studies.

‘Further fuelling the increased student interest has been the strong reputation of American universities and students wanting to set themselves apart in an increasingly competitive job market.’

Penny Egan, executive director of the US-UK Fulbright Commission, added: ‘As the globe shrinks it is wonderful to see young British students taking advantage of the opportunities to study abroad.

‘Outward mobility is high on the agenda and where better to head to than some of the best universities in the world?’

In April, a study by the British Council showed that rising numbers of students were considering studying overseas amid the hike in tuition fees.

More than a third (37 per cent) of 2,630 young people surveyed said they were thinking about heading overseas - up from 20 per cent who stated the same last year.

Meanwhile earlier this year, an analysis of figures on Government website Unistats, found that some students get fewer than half the hours of lectures, seminars and tutorials than others studying the same subject at different universities in Britain.

In 2012, Anthony Seldon, Master of Wellington College, Berkshire, warned that students were being forced to seek courses on the other side of the Atlantic because institutions in this country were stuck in a ‘malaise’.

He said British universities provided less contact time with lecturers and displayed only a ‘perfunctory interest’ in sport and the arts.
