A pet cat was temporarily paralysed and left with eight stitches after a microchip was accidentally injected into its spine, its owner revealed today.

Kristina Hogan, 31, of Consett, County Durham, was ‘devastated’ after handlers injected the chip between the first and second vertebrae of three-year-old Sassie’s neck at a free council event.

Now, the single mother - whose three children were left in tears by the accident - is coming to terms with her pet being confined to a cage for six weeks, having had eight stitches along her back.

Miss Hogan said: ‘The girl doing the chipping seemed not to have a clue what she was doing. She made two attempts to chip Sassie.

‘On the second, she rammed the needle so hard into her she injected the chip between the first and second vertebrae in the neck, paralysing her.

‘If it had gone any further up it would have hit her in the brain, and if it had gone any deeper it would have perforated her spinal cord.’

The chip was inserted by a non-vet worker at a free microchipping session run by the council.

Miss Hogan, who lives on a road with an average house value of £66,000 and is mother to Fatith, six, Katelyn, eight, and Nicholas, 12, took Sassie to Crofts vets in Cramlington.

There, she had scans and surgery to remove the chip. Durham County Council has agreed to pay the £3,000 cost of the surgery and Miss Hogan said she is happy with their response.

But she added: ‘She [Sassie] just used to really enjoy being out - if you opened the door to call her she wouldn’t come and nine times out of 10 you’d have to tempt her in with a bit of ham.

‘Now she’ll never be able to go outside again because she’s too slow to get away from any predators. We won’t know the full extent until she has her cone taken off and her stitches out.

‘It’s affected the children as well - the kids were in tears. They can’t go and give her a cuddle and pick her up because they’re so worried they’re going to hurt her spine.’

The cat was not permanently paralysed, although it may be permanently disabled. Immediately after the microchipping it kept freezing up and losing all movement but it is reportedly feeling better now.

Fears: Miss Hogan said Sassie cannot 'go outside again because she's too slow to get away from predators'

Ian Hoult, neighbourhood protection manager at Durham County Council, said: ‘We are extremely upset and sorry that this has happened.

‘We immediately apologised and have paid for all necessary veterinary care to ensure the animal’s future well-being.

'It is clearly very distressing for all involved and we would like to take this opportunity once again to say sorry.’

The Cats Protection charity says a microchipping procedure normally costs between £20 and £30 - and should be performed by vets, local authorities and trained members of animal welfare groups.

The charity adds that the microchips are slightly smaller than a grain of rice - and should be inserted ‘under the cat's skin between the shoulder blades’.

The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons recommends that ‘appropriately trained non-veterinarians’ can perform a microchipping, and there are training courses available.
