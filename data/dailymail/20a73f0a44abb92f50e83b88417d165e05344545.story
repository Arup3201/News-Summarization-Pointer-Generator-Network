Manchester United's players have been getting to know new boss Louis van Gaal and will be getting familiar with his personality and some of his managerial traits.

Here, Sportsmail has exclusive extracts from Maarten Meijer's explosive new book on the Dutchman which lifts the lid on the new man in charge at Old Trafford.

Louis van Gaal the player would never have survived under Louis van Gaal the manager.

On the ball he was a tall, talented if slow midfielder. But he also wanted to be the man who ran the show.

Talented: As a player Van Gaal, pictured playing for Sparta Rotterdam, was known to argue with referees

In eight years playing for Sparta 
Rotterdam he collected only five yellow cards and every one of them was 
for arguing with referees. That was how he got his only red card, too.

Grumbling at a decision, he told the 
ref: ‘If you want to make it into tomorrow’s newspapers, moustache man, 
you should give me a yellow card.’ The referee immediately obliged, only
 for Van Gaal to raise the stakes: ‘If you want to make it onto the 
front pages, give me another one.’

He moved to Sparta after early years playing part-time with Ajax reserves while working as a PE teacher.

According to team-mate Leen Goeij: ‘Louis comes across as arrogant and assertive. He had hardly arrived and he proclaimed that other players were inept.’

At one stage Welshman Barry Hughes was in charge. ‘He gave the impression he personally had invented the game of football,’ says Hughes. ‘On the pitch he performed well but as a person he was a hopeless case. Things did get better and he was my team captain in the last year but he will never be my friend.’

Outspoken: Van Gaal claimed some players at Sparta Rotterdam were inept soon after arriving at the club
