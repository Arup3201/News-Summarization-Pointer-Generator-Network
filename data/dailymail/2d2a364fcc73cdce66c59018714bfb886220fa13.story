The teenage son of a Romanian business tycoon has told 7,000 staff working for his father they won't be seeing any of the £64m his family recently won in court as he plans to buy a Bugatti.

Victor Micula, 18, who used to turn up at school in Oradea, western Romania, by helicopter in order to sleep in longer, posted online: 'Salaries won't be raised, I'm getting a Bugatti', after he heard about his father's court victory.

Lawyers for the family business had managed to win a High Court battle with the Romanian Treasury that left the company £64m better off.

The news left many company staff and their families - totalling around 28,000 people - disappointed after they had hoped for pay rises following news of the court victory.

However, Victor's father Viorel Micula tried to play down the fact that salaries would not be raised saying that the money earned was what the firm had been due as a result of a court judgement last year which had not been paid.

Mr Micula, who built a business empire with his twin brother Ioan in tourism, property, the media and industry, said: 'We have now won the right to execute the final decision that was given a year ago after which the state refused to pay.

'They tried to offer us shares in the state-owned energy company Petrom. But we wanted the money, we're not interested in shares.

'We need to use the cash to pay our current business expenses. We tried to sort this out in a friendly way, but the state doesn't seem to be interested and we needed to go back to court.

'We should have had the money last year and as a result of not getting it we've had major losses. This sort of situation always favours the state.

'The state can take what they want anytime and they can block any company.'

But his son Victor lives his life in the spotlight of the Romanian media, with the most recent scandal involving his failure in his exams.

He was also criticised earlier when he drove his Ferrari down a pedestrian-only street to go shopping at a jewellery shop with his girlfriend, and was banned from driving for three months when he was caught speeding.

Earlier this year, he told reporters he wanted to go to a Romanian monastery to pray and find peace from exam pressure - but angered those meditating at the building by turning up in his private helicopter.
