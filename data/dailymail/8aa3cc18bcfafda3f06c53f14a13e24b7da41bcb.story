As questions go, it was a simple one.

After seeing posts about a recent refurbishment at a nightclub, one clubber asked if the toilets had also been given a makeover.

But instead of answering the query politely, a representative of the club told her to 'p*** off'.

Conversation: At first, the club's representative on Facebook was civil (left) but the exchange quickly took a turn for the worse

Rude: The representative said Ms Murphy was 'not wanted' at China Red before telling her to 'p*** off'

Rowena Murphy visited the nightclub, 
China Red Boutique, in Birmingham on New Year's Eve and was appalled by 
the state of its filthy and broken toilets, which were stained with 
faeces and vomit.

When she 
read about the recent refurbishment on the club's Facebook page, she 
posted a message asking whether the toilets had been improved.

Ms
Murphy received a private message back, which read: ‘Rowena maybe would
have been better to send us a private message re toilets.’

The
exchange quickly turned nasty, however, when the admin told her to 
'p*** off' and that her custom was no longer welcome in the club.

Ms Murphy, 22, from Birmingham, 
responded by saying that she was going to tell everyone via social media
about China Red's customer service and posted the conversation on 
Twitter.

The representative asked for her phone number but the damage had already been done.

Ms
Murphy claims the owners of the club have since ‘bombarded’ her friend 
Natalie Bowen with calls after she tagged them in the picture online.

On
her Twitter account, she says a PR representative for the club has 
since contacted her to claim their Facebook account was hacked.

In
a Tumblr post, Ms Bowen, 21, explains: ‘Today was very interesting. A 
friend and I successfully created a (very small) twitter storm about the
appalling customer service provided by China Red Boutique nightclub in 
Birmingham.

‘For some 
context - my friend Rowena visited the club on New Year's Eve. 
Apparently, it's a very respectable place but the toilets were like 
something out of Trainspotting.

‘When
the club posted about their refurbishment, my friend politely asked if 
they'd also refurbed the toilets - nothing implied, no rudeness, and not
even a mention of how they looked on NYE.

‘The manager (or whatever cretin runs their Facebook account) decided to send her some pretty bad abuse.

‘I
thought this was pretty shocking, and decided to do my bit by sharing 
the photo and tagging China Red in the process. They promptly untagged, 
and decided to harass me with calls.

‘When
I answered, the lady spoke in a hushed voice, claiming that their 
account had been hacked and could I take the photo down immediately. 
Obviously, I didn't comply.’

Screengrabs
of the conversation have now gone viral and the hashtag 
#justwantedtoknowaboutthetoilets is fast spreading on Twitter, with the 
original post being retweeted hundreds of times.

Backlash: China Red (pictured) has claimed that somebody hacked their Facebook account and sent the messages

China Red have since removed their Facebook and Twitter accounts.

Chris Whitaker, club host at China 
Red, explained several people had access to the club's Facebook page and
that anyone could have posted the messages.

He
said: ‘My guess is as good as yours as to who posted this. We think 
someone with access to the page has intervened in a conversation and 
told Rowena to p**** off.

‘Obviously,
no one wants to be spoken to like that and we have messaged Rowena to 
apologise and to offer her down to the club for a VIP night. But since 
she won't give us her number, we haven't been able to speak to her 
directly.

‘This has all been blown out of proportion and a lot of the posts about us have been very silly and immature. We don't want people going around giving the club a bad name but there's only so many times we can apologise.’
