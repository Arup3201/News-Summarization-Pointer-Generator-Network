Mystery: Murdered British businessman Neil Heywood

Police investigating the suspected murder of British businessman Neil Heywood have made dozens of arrests, it was claimed yesterday.

Up to 39 people have been detained in a series of raids over several months on officials linked to politician Bo Xilai, whose wife is a suspect in the death.

Those arrested were reported to include billionaire Xu Ming, one of China’s richest men.

The news emerged within hours of the ruling Communist Party promising a ‘thorough’ inquiry into the ‘serious political event’.

Chinese
authorities were believed to have been stung by criticism in Britain 
over delays in the investigation into Mr Heywood’s death in November 
last year, which has prompted China’s worst political scandal for 20 
years.

Reports in China 
suggest Mr Heywood, a close associate of Mr Bo and his wife Gu Kailai, 
was poisoned with cyanide after he threatened to reveal Mrs Gu had 
siphoned millions of pounds in cash out of the country.

Those arrested were said to have links to Mr Bo and his previous roles as a Communist Party leader in Dalian and Chongqing, suggesting most  of the raids were linked to a corruption probe into the politician.

Police investigating the death of Old Harrovian Mr Heywood, 41, have begun analysing hours of CCTV footage taken from the hotel where his body was discovered.

They hope the security film will show the married father-of-two’s final movements at the state-owned Nanshan Lijing Holiday Hotel in Nan’an, a district of Chongqing.

Billionaire Mr Xu, 41, who heads the 
Dalian Shide Group industrial conglomerate, was said to have been taken 
to Beijing by China’s public security bureau on the same day Mr Bo was 
sacked as party chief in Chongqing last month.

Those
detained were also said to include Xia Zeliang, the local Communist 
Party secretary in Nan’an. Mr Xia was fast-tracked for promotion within 
the Communist Party by Mr Bo, 62.

Internet reports claimed he had allegedly prepared the poison and gave it to a Bo family employee.

Other arrests were made in Beidaihe, a favourite retreat for Communist Party leaders, according to academic Wang Kang who spoke to the Daily Telegraph.

His claims could not be independently verified.

Mrs Gu, 54, and an aide in the family home have been formally named as suspects in Mr Heywood’s ‘intentional homicide’. Mr Bo remains under house arrest and faces a Communist Party investigation for ‘serious disciplinary violations’.

Sources have claimed he will be investigated for corruption and attempting to cover up his wife’s alleged involvement in the death.
