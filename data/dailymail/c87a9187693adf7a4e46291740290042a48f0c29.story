People who want to see Tony Blair jailed for the Iraq War have their ‘heart in the right place’, Boris Johnson said today.

But the London Mayor warned it would be ‘very difficult’ to convict the former Prime Minister because he is ‘a very eel-like customer’.

The senior Tory spoke out as it emerged the bill for the long-delayed report on the 2003 conflict is on course to hit £10million.

Tony Blair, pictured answering questions in 2010, has been accused of trying to delay publication of the Chilcot Inquiry

There is growing pressure for the 
Chilcot Inquiry to publish its report, almost five years since it was 
announced by the last Labour government.

David Cameron wants it to be released as soon as possible, with Mr Blair denying he is responsible for the hold-up.

Today
 Mr Johnson said that he had come to view the entire case for the move 
to topple Saddam Hussein as ‘nonsense’ and had sympathy for those who 
want Mr Blair to face the law.

Taking
 calls on LBC 97.3, he said: ‘I’d like to see the report published. 
There will be plenty of arguments you can make about bringing all kinds 
of people to justice.

London Mayor Boris Johnson said it would be difficult to convict Mr Blair for war crimes

‘I 
happen to think that in the case of Tony Blair, it will be quite 
difficult to secure a conviction. He is a very eel like customer. 
[Laughter]. I think it would be very unlikely that you’d get him.’

He
 later added: ‘I mean, you can have some very nice eels. I don’t want to
 be rude to the former Prime Minister, you can have some; I felt guilty 
as soon as I said that.

‘He
 can be, you know, he’s a very, very adept and agile lawyer and I think 
that … our caller who thought that he was going to be imprisoned for 
what he did in Iraq, his heart is in the right place.’

Mr
 Johnson added: ‘I just think there will undoubtedly be people who 
continue to try to bring Tony Blair to justice in one way or another. I 
think it unlikely that they will succeed in that respect.’ 

Sir
 John Chilcot’s investigation into the 2003 conflict last took evidence 
from a witness three years ago but the report has yet to be published.

It
 was claimed today that a row over the publication of conversations 
between former Prime Minister Tony Blair and ex US president George W 
Bush is behind the delay.

The Daily Mirror reported that the row over publication of the pair's letters and meetings could mean the cost to the 
taxpayer rises to around £10million.

Whitehall sources say the process of declassifying 
documents, including Mr Blair’s correspondence with the then President, remains stalled.

It
 is thought that no one involved has so far received a letter from the 
inquiry as part of the so-called  ‘Maxwellisation’ process – the legal 
requirement to notify individuals who are criticised in a 
government-commissioned report.

Whitehall sources 
have also suggested that with an election due in May 2015, it will be 
deemed too politically difficult to publish it until after voters have 
gone to the polls.

One of the main bones of contention over the report into the conflict (pictured) is private notes between Blair and the then US President George W. Bush

One
 source has said: ‘It’s certainly not going to be ready before the end of 
the year and it would be a highly political act to publish in the months
 before an election. The can is going to be kicked further down the 
road.’

Labour 
strategists are said to be alarmed at the prospect of voters being 
reminded of the Iraq war in the months before the election, since the 
conflict was blamed for driving many of its voters to the Liberal 
Democrats in 2005 and 2010.

The delays and the spiraling bill has added to the anger felt by families of soldiers killed in the conflict, it claims.

Rose
 Gentle, from the Military Families Support Group told the Daily Mirror that 
members of her organisation feel Mr Blair is 'laughing at them'.

It is said the delays to the report by Sir John Chilcot (right) have been caused by a row over letters between George W. Bush (left) and Tony Blair

Current Prime Minister David Cameron waded into the row this week when he called for the report to be made public as quickly as possible

A
 No 10 aide said: ‘The PM believes there is no excuse for any 
further lengthy delay in publishing Chilcot. It would be unreasonable to
 postpone it beyond the next election.’

A Cabinet Office spokesperson said last night: 'The Chilcot Inquiry has had full unfettered access to all government papers.

'The
 Cabinet Office has been in a constructive dialogue with the Inquiry 
team over recent months, with a clear view to meeting their 
declassification requests.

'This
 has involved several thousand documents, subject only to ensuring that 
national security and foreign policy objectives are not compromised as 
provided for in the protocol agreed at the outset of the Inquiry. That 
process should be concluded shortly.'
