We know them as the warriors in horned helmets who raped and pillaged their way around Europe.

But when the Vikings were not at war, Scandinavian society was deeply concerned about their ‘anti-social behaviour’ according to experts.

Dr Tarrin Wills, of the University of Aberdeen, said medieval chroniclers ‘profiled’ notorious criminals by giving detailed descriptions of their build, hair and facial features in a similar way to today’s police mugshots.

A 17th-century Icelandic manuscript of Egill Skallagrimsson, who was a Viking described as having a 'lifelong interest in homicide'

After returning from treasure-grabbing raids – of which Britain was a particular target – there was concern that Viking pirates were attacking their neighbours’ farms and going on killing sprees.

Dr Wills who analysed 13th century Icelandic legends, written down from stories passed down the generations, said they read like a precursor of ‘Crimewatch’.

One notorious warrior they describe is Egill Skallagrimsson, a tenth century terror who committed his first murder aged seven ‘after what sounds like a rugby game’, Dr Wills said. 

The manuscript details his full beard, bushy eyebrows, and wide forehead, ‘very broad’ chin and jaw and ‘thick neck and broad shoulders’.

Dr Wills said: ‘This was text was not created so much as a record of achievement in battle, but to address what was seen as a problem at home.

‘A good Viking should be aggressive and dominant, he should go abroad, rape and pillage. But many of these guys end up back home and having to settle down to farming and family life.

‘The kind of guys who are good at rape and pillage, are not very good husbands and farmers, and the society was sensitive to a whole range of indicators of anti social behaviour.’

Dr Tarrin Wills, of the University of Aberdeen claims the records of descriptions of Vikings may be a first example of criminal profiling

Dr Wills, a historian, believes the Vikings were aware that physical characteristics such as facial hair and muscle - now associated with high testosterone levels - were linked to aggressive behaviour.

Physical descriptions were unusual in medieval manuscripts and are usually only mentioned if relevant to the plot, or describing their dress or complexion to reflect their wealth, he said.

But in these tales - known as the Icelandic sagas - he found a strong link between physical descriptions suggesting high testosterone, in dominant and aggressive people such as outlaws and killers.

His study, in the journal Viking and Medieval Scandinavia also linked individuals described as having narrow shoulders and small facial features to low testosterone behaviour, such as having straying wives or failing in battle.

Those writing the texts, thought to be wealthy farmers whose territory was at risk from raiders, were concerned with helping to spot people who might behave in violent ways.

Dr Wills told the British Science Festival in Aberdeen yesterday: ‘These early Viking authors pinpointed the physical markers of testosterone, including them in descriptions of great warriors.

‘In this sense they were perhaps the first to begin criminal profiling. As a result they served as mugshots of likely offenders and a warning to wider Viking Society.’

Egill was a typical warrior, who went raiding in England and elsewhere. He lived a long life, spending his time looting treasure, drinking, fighting and ‘writing insulting poems’.

He carried out several murders in Iceland, which Dr Wills said was ‘akin to the Wild West’, full of young men trying to acquire land for themselves and their families often by violence.

Vikings, or pirates, originated in Scandinavia, and from the years 700 to 1100 plundered their way around England, Ireland, Europe and even as far afield as Asia.

They stepped up raids on Britain in the 790s to loot treasure from monasteries, and in 856AD stormed the kingdoms of Northumbria, East Anglia and Mercia, before being pushed back by Alfred the Great.

But they came back with a vengeance, the raids continuing until the first Danish king took the throne – King Canute of Denmark in 1016.
