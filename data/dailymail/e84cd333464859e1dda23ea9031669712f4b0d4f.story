Paul Lambert has advice for anyone caught in the crosshairs of Roy Keane’s latest book: ‘Take cover!’

The Aston Villa manager has been granted a preview look at his assistant’s autobiography update, titled ‘The Second Half’, which goes on sale on October 9.

Sir Alex Ferguson is expected to come in for fierce words after the former Manchester United manager offered severe criticism of Keane in his book released last year.

Memorable quotes from Roy Keane:

'I'd waited long enough. I ******* hit him hard. The ball was there (I think). Take that you ****.'

On that tackle on Alf Inge Haaland 

'Brian Clough, without a doubt'

When asked the best manager he had played under (a snub to Sir Alex Ferguson) 

'You can stick it up your b*******'

Keane to Mick McCarthy in 2002

'At home they (United fans) have a few drinks and probably the prawn sandwiches, and they don't realise what's going on out on the pitch.'

Keane on the 'prawn sandwich brigade' 

'Going to work was like going to war'

On his attitude to his work 

'The players gave it their all tonight but we are just not good enough and maybe it's time to move on. Maybe it's the end of the road for this team.'

Mention of the Keane’s literary effort to Lambert, published two days before Ireland face Gibraltar at the Aviva Stadium, brought a smile to the face of the Aston Villa manager. He offered a simple but revealing review.

‘I’ve seen bits of it,’ he said. ‘And it’ll be… aye… listen, take cover like. It will be good reading put it that way. Great night-time reading.’

Lambert said the club had not needed to vet Keane’s writing, adding, ‘I’m pretty sure it will be alright’, and joked any passages about him would be minimal.

‘He’s got a full stop dedicated to me,’ laughed Lambert.

On their relationship at Villa, Lambert added: ‘He’s been really great round about the place.

'We have a good laugh, it’s not all serious. He’s got great experience of football, a great guy to have beside me.’
