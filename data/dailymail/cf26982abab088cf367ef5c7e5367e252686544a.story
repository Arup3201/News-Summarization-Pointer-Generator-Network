Ronny Deila is praying for a glamour tie in the last 32 of the Europa League that will bring the thunder back to Parkhead.

A thumping 4-1 win over managerless St Mirren increased the gap at the top of the Premiership to six points and teed up Monday’s draw in Nyon.

Inter Milan, Everton, Atletico Bilbao and old foes Legia Warsaw are just four of the teams the Scottish champions could face.

With large gaps in the Parkhead stands now a feature at home games, Deila wants the kind of name which could bring the missing fans back and pack the stadium to the rafters.

‘It’s going to be a hard draw whoever we get,’ said the Norwegian. ‘We’re going to meet a good club.

‘We want a good draw so we can fill the stadium and get 60,000 here - which is the atmosphere we want. Everybody is beatable but some are harder than others.’

Celtic’s reinstatement to the Champions League sparked a row with Legia Warsaw in the summer and, following a 6-1 aggregate defeat, Deila admitted he would rather avoid the Poles.

‘Would I like Legia Warsaw? They’re a good team of course and it would be a special team if we got them. Hopefully we will get something else - but our players will be up for the game whoever we get.’

Two goals from Scott Brown and one apiece from James Forrest – his first of the season – and Anthony Stokes eased Celtic past St Mirren.

Brown missed the Legia double header with an early season injury, but has no preferences ahead of the draw.

‘I don’t think it really matters – we will happily take on anybody,’ he said. ‘If it’s at Celtic Park, whoever we get it’s a great atmosphere and a great occasion for us.’

St Mirren equalised through full-back Sean Kelly and made early chances, but had keeper Mark Ridgers to thank for keeping the score down after the home side blew a raft of chances.

‘It was a slow start from us,’ said Deila, ‘but we improved towards the end of the first half. We kept possession, created chances and scored three good goals.

‘We moved the ball very quickly which was good. We then created a lot of chances in the second half and got to 4-1. After that we controlled the game.

‘Overall it’s a good win, an important win. That’s us six points ahead so I’m very satisfied.

Sean Kelly equalised for St MIrren but James Forrest (above) restored Celtic's lead in the 15th minute 

‘We are creating chances and that’s the positive thing. But again, I was thinking: “Is it enough? Should we be scoring more goals?”

‘That is something we have to work on if we are going to improve. We need to be more clinical.’

Deila played down fresh fears over Forrest, removed at half-time, by explaining the winger had a migraine.

However, John Guidetti took a kick which forced his removal after 55 minutes and the Swede faces tests on Monday morning.

‘Hopefully he’s going to be okay,’ said Deila. ‘The medical people checked him and said they think it’s just a kick, but you never know with these things.’

Celtic – watched by former idol Shunsuke Nakamura - are now easing towards a fourth successive title and Brown believes they will take some stopping.

Anthony Stokes (centre) caps off a dominant display for the home side with his 67th minute strike 

‘It has taken time, but we are starting to find our form. On this form it will be hard for teams to catch us.

‘If we keep going and creating the chances and scoring the goals we are going to be hard to beat.

‘Europe is always different and it’s hard for us there. Everyone knows the teams we can get, it’s going to be difficult no matter where we go.

‘The SPFL is the one for us and we need to concentrate more than anything on that – to retain that title again.’
