The Islamic State's black jihadist flag has been obliterated in a devastating airstrike by American forces on a Kobane hillside controlled by the militant group.

In a series of images, what appears to be an ISIS militant can first be seen standing by the flag on Tilsehir hill near the Turkish border - after the terrorist group seized control of the strategically important hilltop 4km west of the town.

Just moments later the hillside erupts into flames as the man flees for his life - and the fighter appears to stand his ground against the ferocious power of the weapon, although whether it is indeed a militant has not yet been confirmed.

The images have emerged as American and Arab jets launched fresh attacks on ISIS positions in the north of Kobane - with pyrotechnic tracer ammunition lighting up the night sky and coalition warplanes destroying ISIS-held buildings with a barrage of air-to-surface missiles.

The hillside is completely obliterated in the attack - said to be launched by U.S. forces. The images have emerged as American and Arab jets launched fresh attacks on ISIS positions in the north of Kobane

The pictures were captured at Yumurtalik village, in Sanliurfa province. Turkey, which has riled Kurdish leaders and frustrated Washington by refusing to allow fighters or weapons into Kobane, said this week it would help Iraqi Kurdish fighters cross into Syria to help their brethren against the militants

The terrorist group was thought to have been pushed out of the centre of the besieged Syrian city after hundreds of brave Kurdish resistance fighters coordinated fierce street battles with coalition bombing raids - forcing the well-equipped jihadis to retreat into the outskirts of Kobane. 

The pictures were captured at Yumurtalik village, in Sanliurfa province. 

Earlier the flag was still visible in Kobane - despite Kurdish territorial gains and weeks of sustained airstrikes by American and Arab warplanes.

It could clearly still be seen inside city, raised over a multi-storey building just a few hundred feet away from where the yellow, triangular flag of the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG) was seen fluttering above a largely destroyed housing complex.

The chilling image of the ISIS flag still flying in Kobane emerged as lawmakers in Iraq's largely autonomous Kurdish region authorized peshmerga forces to cross into neighboring Syria to help fellow Kurds combat Islamic State militants in the city, providing much-needed boots on the ground.

The unprecedented deployment will almost certainly depend on the support of Turkey, whose president criticized a U.S. airdrop of arms to Kurdish fighters after some of the weapons wound up in the hands of the extremists.

Turkey, which has riled Kurdish leaders and frustrated Washington by refusing to allow fighters or weapons into Kobane, said this week it would help Iraqi Kurdish fighters cross into Syria to help their brethren against the militants, who also are being attacked by a U.S.-led campaign of airstrikes.

But it is not clear how many fighters will be allowed in or whether they will be allowed to carry enough weapons to make an impact.

The Kurds of Syria and Iraq have become a major focal point in the war against the Islamic State group, with Kurdish populations in both countries coming under significant threat by the militants' lightning advance.

Lt. Gen. Frederick Hodges, the outgoing commander of NATO's Land Command in Izmir, Turkey, said the Turks have agreed to open up 'a land bridge of sorts' so that the peshmerga can get into Kobane to help with the fighting there.

'It seems to me that between the United States, Turkey and other countries, they are figuring out what is permissible to make sure that ISIL is not successful and that it is something that Turkey can live with,' he added, using an acronym for the group.
