'Big row'? Mel B admitted having an argument with her husband Stephen Belafonte in an interview with gossip magazine Grazia published online last night

The husband of Mel B yesterday vehemently rejected claims he might be responsible for apparent marks on her face and body.

The former Spice Girl provoked fevered speculation after she returned to The X Factor on Sunday with what appeared to be scratches and a bruised cheek.

The judge came back for the final after being admitted to hospital on Thursday but there was no explanation for her absence.

Viewers took to Twitter to make comments about the mysterious marks, linking them to her husband Stephen Belafonte, who has previously been accused of being violent and possessive towards a girlfriend.

But yesterday he described the remarks as ‘disgusting’. He said, using typical celeb Twitter speak: ‘I don’t usually respond to Twitter msgs but I will respond to comments of hitting wife which I think are quite disgusting untrue.

‘Mel was very ill a bunch of doctors help her get better if fans can’t just relax B4 being negative they r not real fans of Mel B.’

It was just a month ago that Belafonte presented his wife with a wedding ring ‘upgrade’ – a seven-carat diamond the size of a ten-pence piece.

He handed her the ring just as she was about to go on air for The X Factor – a dramatic, romantic gesture. On Sunday night, however, the giant bauble was visibly absent from Mel Brown’s wedding finger.

According to a well-placed source on The X Factor, Belafonte, 39, did not visit his wife of seven years during the three days she spent in hospital. Nor, says the source, was Belafonte with her at The X Factor studios for the final on Sunday. 

The fact that Mel B has removed her wedding ring ‘upgrade’ is surely an indicator that the seven-year marriage is in serious trouble. Could it be all over between them?

It is telling that when the Mail contacted Mel B’s agent and publicist yesterday and asked whether the marriage was over, neither would confirm or deny the suggestion.

The source revealed that Belafonte is not liked by other members of The X Factor team.

‘None of that means that he has ever laid a finger on Mel, but he is not an easy person to be with, that is obvious to see. It was a physical and emotional collapse. There was an emotional element to it, Mel has been under a lot of stress.

‘He didn’t come to the show on Sunday as far as I am aware. He wasn't in her dressing room. I don’t believe he visited her in hospital, either.’

Mel B was three hours late for an interview with Grazia, published online last night, in which she was described as 'not in the best of moods' and reportedly admitted an argument with Belafonte.

'I walked in pissed off because I had a big row with my husband about stupid stuff,' Grazia's Olivia Foster quoted the former Spice Girl as saying.

'Sometimes he p***** me off like no other, but he gets me.'

Bruised? Fans took to Twitter during X Factor on Sunday to claim that Mel's face look bruised

On Sunday, Belafonte was seen outside the Kensington block of flats where he and Mel, 39, have been renting an apartment since October, overseeing the loading of about 20 suitcases into a minivan.

So what do we know of the events of the past few days?

According to the X Factor source, Mel B was on her way to Wembley Arena on Thursday afternoon for a press conference with the judges and finalists when she was taken ill.

‘The driver, who has known Mel for a while and is a good guy, took her to A&E – he was that concerned – and she was admitted.

‘She was discharged on Sunday after asking the doctors if she could go at lunchtime.’

The source says that reports that Mel was in a high dependency unit may not be accurate. ‘That’s not to say that she wasn’t unwell, because she was.’ The source says Mel underwent tests, but would not say what these tests revealed.

No wedding ring: Mel B appeared on X Factor on Sunday without her wedding ring. It's just a month since Belafonte presented her with a wedding ring ‘upgrade’ – a seven-carat diamond the size of a ten-pence piece

Speculation about the marriage has been so intense partly on account of Belafonte’s history.

In 2007, shortly after their marriage in June that year, it emerged that Belafonte had been charged with battery in America after being arrested for attacking his then girlfriend, Nicole Contreras.

He pleaded ‘no contest’ to the battery charge – which the judge stated was the same as a guilty plea – and was ordered to take part in a ‘Domestic Violence Batterers’ Programme’. 

In 2008, around the time Mel and Belafonte had a wedding blessing in Egypt, a friend of Miss Contreras told a newspaper about his violent and possessive character. Nicole is said to have told her friend: ‘I fear for Melanie because a leopard does not change his spots.

‘He seems utterly charming – but I’m afraid it won’t be long before his mask slips.’

Nicole told her friend that Stephen was over-possessive. ‘I would be away on photo shoots and Stephen would call my hotel room hundreds of times a night demanding: “Who the **** are you with, Nikki?”

‘One time we went out partying in Hollywood and Stephen was convinced a man in the bar was eyeing me up, which was total rubbish. Stephen followed him out of the bar and beat him senseless.’

Miss Contreras’s friend told the newspaper the relationship became on and off and finally ended after Belafonte told Nicole he’d met someone else. Nicole told the friend: ‘One night he turned to me and said, “Nikki, I’ve met someone who is very famous and very rich and wants to marry me but if you will have me back then I’ll forget it”. He wouldn’t say who she was but said, “She is so rich she could change my life”.’

Of course, these could be the observations of a woman scorned. But Mel B is certainly rich – she is worth an estimated £35million. The situation is messy. Since the marriage, Mel B has been estranged from her family. When her family learned she had been admitted to hospital, her mother, Andrea Brown, was forced to post a series of messages on Twitter pleading for information about her daughter.

At her home in Leeds yesterday, Mrs Brown said she did not know any more about what had happened to her daughter than anyone else.

Cursed? Couples who speak to Hello! about their idyllic relationships sometimes split shortly afterwards

Only last week, Mel B was Hello! Magazine’s cover story. It is customary for interviewees in Hello! to present a perfect family life and Mel was no exception.

But has the famous curse of Hello! – by which couples who speak about their idyllic relationship split up shortly afterwards – struck again?

In one photograph, Mel B is seated on a sofa with her husband and three daughters – Phoenix, 15, from her first marriage to dancer Jimmy Gulzar, seven-year-old Angel, from her relationship with actor Eddie Murphy, and Madison, she and Stephen’s three-year-old daughter. Mel gushed about how happy she was with Stephen. ‘He’s the first man I’ve ever trusted, he’s my rock and he’s the beginning and the end of who I am.’

In America, where she now lives, Mel B appears as a judge on America’s Got Talent and has starred in her own reality show, Mel B: It’s A Scary World. Mel was unsure whether the girl best known here as Scary Spice would go down well on X Factor, but the risk paid off and has revived her name in the UK.

But the X Factor final of 2014, won by Ben Haenow, will now be remembered for all the mystery surrounding Mel’s hospital dash.

Back in 2010, there were reports that the couple had split in the run-up to It’s A Scary World, but it was later claimed that the ‘split’ was a publicity stunt.

Some may believe this latest episode, too, is a publicity stunt, a way of getting even with fellow judge and X Factor supremo, Simon Cowell, who had been critical of her act, Andrea Faustini.

If it is a stunt, it’s a highly convincing act. Backstage on X Factor, it did not go unnoticed that Mel’s demeanour changed whenever her husband was about. Maybe that influence is slipping now and Mel has decided to break away.
