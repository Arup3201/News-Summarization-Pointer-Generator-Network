The memory of eating a large meal can make people feel less hungry hours after tucking into food, according to new research.

After a series of tests experts found that people who think they have eaten more - but have actually eaten an average-sized or smaller portion - are less likely to experience hunger pangs hours later.

The discovery could now be used to help dieters struggling to lose weight.

The memory of a big meal could make you feel less hungry and help you lose weight, researchers at Bristol University have found

They then manipulated the amount of soup they actually ate using a hidden pump that could refill or empty a soup bowl without the eater noticing.

Professor Jeffrey Brunstorm and his 
colleagues from the University of Bristol made the discovery after 
showing a volunteers either a small or large bowl of soup just before 
lunch.

Immediately after they had eaten, the level of hunger reported by the volunteers was equal to the amount of food they had eaten, not the amount they had seen just before eating.

However, two to three hours after lunch, volunteers who had been shown a larger portion of soup were significantly less hungry than those who had seen the smaller portion.

Researchers manipulated the amount of soup the volunteers had eaten via a hidden pump that could refill or empty the bowl without them knowing. They hope that dieters could be tricked into thinking they had eaten more to help them control their hunger pangs even though they had had a smaller portion

Twenty four hours later, more of these volunteers who had seen the bigger portions believed that the portion of soup they had consumed would satisfy their hunger.

 A drink that could not only help you lose weight, but could also treat epilepsy, diabetes and possibly even Alzheimer's has been developed by Oxford scientists.

The drink has been brewed by Kieran Clarke, professor of physiological biochemistry at Oxford University and head of its Cardiac Metabolism Research Group, at the behest of the U.S. Army.

The drink doesn’t involve a new drug. It contains something our bodies produce all the time.

This key ingredient is ketones — the sources of energy our bodies make naturally when we start using up our fat stores for energy because there are no carbs around.

According to the authors, their results show the impact memory processes have on feelings of satiety after a meal.

They believe their findings could be used to trick dieters into thinking they were more full, and in turn reduce how much they ate.

Prof Brunstrom said: 'For the first time, this manipulation exposes the independent and important contribution of memory processes to satiety.

'Opportunities exist to capitalise on this finding to reduce energy intake in humans.

'This study is exciting because it exposes a role for cognition in the control of hunger - appetite isn’t governed solely by the physical size and composition of the meals we consume.'

The study was published in the open access journal PLOS ONE.
