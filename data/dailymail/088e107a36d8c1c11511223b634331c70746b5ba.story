Seven years ago this week, Jordan Henderson was the only Sunderland reserve-team player to remain on the bench at a windswept and rain-lashed Kingston Park.

The Black Cats' second string had just beaten North-East rivals Newcastle 3-1 but they didn't need a 17-year-old Henderson. He was highly-rated but yet to make his senior bow and a loan spell at Coventry City beckoned. That same year he lost out to academy team-mate Nathan Luscombe in the Soccer AM Skill Skool showdown. Luscombe now plays for Celtic Nation in the Northern league.

Henderson, however, is set to inherit the Liverpool captaincy from MLS-bound Steven Gerrard. On Saturday, he was back at the club who sold him to the Reds for £20million in 2011. And, after Gerrard made way at half-time, we were afforded a 45-minute snapshot of life with Henderson as leader.

 It is now almost certain he will be appointed club captain in the summer.

And, following the 1-0 win, Brendan Rodgers said: 'I've already put him as vice-captain of the club. He's grown, not just as a footballer, but as a young man over the past two-and-a-half years with me. You could see his quality and his leadership, his running ability and power.

'He's a fantastic young man and the reason for giving him that role (vice-captain), was that for when Steven isn't on the field he's a real leader for us.

'There's no question that he can go and become the captain at the club.'

In the first half, with Gerrard at his side, the pair had bossed the contest, teasing passes between themselves and the outstanding Philippe Coutinho, outclassing and outworking their red-and-white adversaries. 

Minus Gerrard, though, Henderson assumed added responsibility. His first task was to take a necessary booking for his side, clipping the heels of Adam Johnson with the Sunderland winger in full flight and headed for a backpedaling rearguard.

Conscious of his caution, Henderson stationed himself at the centre of the park. From there he dictated the tempo of a game which was always within the grasp of he and his comrades and they emerged comfortable winners, despite the 1-0 scoreline.

He may not boast the dynamic forward bursts of Gerrard, but there is a discipline about Henderson which serves as reassurance for manager Brendan Rodgers.

Indeed, as Mario Balotelli lined up one 40-yard free-kick, it was to Henderson whom Rodgers screamed advising against a shot on goal. Balotelli duly crashed an audacious effort into the wall regardless of the instruction, but it was clear who the man on the touchline trusted as his onfield general in the absence of Gerrard.

Henderson speaks of his soon-to-be-former team-mate in the highest regard. He does, though, see himself as the heir apparent at Anfield.

'There's only one leader at the moment and that is Stevie,' said the England midfielder.

'Next season with Stevie going then things may change a little. Everyone was in shock as he is such a big leader for us. He said the time is right so we have to respect that.'

Now, however, you must respect Henderson as the captain-in-waiting at Anfield. On this evidence, he will do a fine job.
