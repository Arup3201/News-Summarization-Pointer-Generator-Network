Classic car manufacturer Bristol Cars is facing a £300,000 payout after failing to convert a lawyer's vintage 1954 model into a coupe.

Andrew Olins said he had long dreamed of owning the rare Bristol 405D and was overjoyed to be able to buy one as a birthday present to himself.

He bought the car, one of only 43 ever built, for £20,000 in 2011 - and paid £153,000 extra for the manufacturer to convert it into a drophead coupé, the High Court heard according to the Evening Standard.

But nine months later, Bristol Cars told Mr Olins it would not be able to complete the changes.

The London based lawyer then decided to sue for breach on contract in March 2012.

The company admitted it had lost key technical staff who had the knowledge about how the hand-built Bristol cars were made, a judge heard.

There were 22 redundancies at the company before it went into administration and was taken over, it was said.

According to the Evening Standard, Mr Olins told the court of his love for the car.

in Piccadilly when I was 18 and fell in love with it.

British luxury car manufacturers Bristol Cars was originally founded in 1946 as an off-shoot of the Bristol Aeroplane Company.

Amongst
the roll-call of famous owners are Bono, Liam Gallagher, Tina Turner 
and Sir Richard Branson but by the end, it's rumoured that the company 
was shifting just 20 vehicles a year.

It was bought in 1960 by former racing driver and RAF pilot Tony Crook who allegedly old sold the cars to people he liked.

It has only one showroom, in Kensington, but has maintained a loyal customer base.

'At the time I thought to myself, if I could ever afford it, this was a car I would wish to drive.'

Bristol Cars denied Mr Olins' claims and said the improvements  - costing £153,000 - had only ever been as estimate.

It also said no legal documentation had been signed, labelling the situation a 'fundamental shared mistake', and adding that the request for an automatic transmission by Mr Olins had always been an impossibility.

The judge said claiming that there was no agreed price, or agreed maximum, was 'wholly unsustainable.'

He added tthe company had 'agreed to adapt the automatic gearbox to suit this engine and match the transmission points as required.'

Outside court, Mr Olins said he had been treated shabbily, and had paid £50,000 upfront.

He is seeking between £200,000 and £300,000, and a hearing to assess damages will be held next year.

It has been reported that Bristol Cars will be contesting the level of damages vigorously.
