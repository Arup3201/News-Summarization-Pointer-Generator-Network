It looked like a rare act of kindness in the midst of mindless violence.

Dazed and bleeding, a young man sitting on the ground had been beaten senseless during a violent street attack in Hackney.

Surrounded by a small crowd of curious onlookers, a ‘Good Samaritan’ gently helps the vulnerable and frightened young man to his feet.

But within seconds looters decided this was a target too good to ignore.

Dazed and confused, blood dripping from his mouth, a young man is encircled by thugs after being savagely beaten to the ground during the violence in London

From nowhere, an apparent Good Samaritan walks up and lends a hand to help heave the struggling and injured victim up from the pavement

A sickening YouTube video then captures one of the most callous moments in three days of violent disorder.

A passer-by  –  spotting the opportunity – circles round behind the confused man and breaks into his rucksack.

He unzips it, searching for something to steal, and within seconds the heartless thief is joined by a handful of other thugs swarming around the man’s rucksack.

Even the apparently kind-hearted individual who initially helps the man unsteadily to his feet appears to burrow into the bag.

Lowest of the low: The teenager continues to tend to the wounds on his face as thieves make off with the contents of his rucksack

Lawless: One of the yobs shamelessly rifles through the teenager's bag as he stands, dazed from his injury

Daylight robbery: The boy becomes aware of what is happening as the gang closes in around him

It is only then, too late, that the young man realises what is going on behind his back. Until then he had continued attending to the blood still dripping from his head and mouth.

He weakly swats a hand at one of the robbers, but it has little effect.

For the first thug, dressed in a baseball cap, windcheater and blue jeans, pulls something out of the rucksack, contemptuously discards the plastic wrapping and then struts off with his loot.

Helping themselves: The thieves examine their loot as the teenager tries to get away

Discarded: The robber, having taken the items from the teenager's bag, then casually throws them to the floor before strolling away

Aftermath: The boy is caught on camera moments later, standing confused and alone at the side of the street

An appalled narrator to the film, which was posted on YouTube, says: ‘Are they actually  helping him up? Oh my God. Are they going through his bag? ‘He just took something from his bag. ****head.’

The footage, called ‘London Riots – Scum steal from injured boy’, was posted by Abdul Hamid. His written comments to the film state: ‘This is evil. I hope these scumbags are caught.’

One YouTube user, Skiv2oo, commented on the footage: ‘I can’t stop watching this, it makes me so angry it’s unbelievable.’
