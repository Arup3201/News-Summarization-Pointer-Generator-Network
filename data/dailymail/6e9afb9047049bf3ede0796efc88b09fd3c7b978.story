When nurse Jane Wilkinson-Tancock saw another mother zooming away from the school gates in a flashy Audi convertible, she started to think she might be in the wrong job.

So she decided to forge a career for herself on the sidelines – or rather on her living room sofa.

Now the 43-year-old is one of a growing number of ‘middle-class gamblers’ who hope to make a fortune by trading on the stock exchange from the comfort of their own homes.

Part-time trader: Jane Wilkinson-Tancock, from Crediton, Devon, with her children, (L-R) Charlotte, 7, Chloe, 4 and Rufus, 5, spends her spare time playing the stock market

Recalling her moment of inspiration at her children’s school, Mrs Wilkinson-Tancock said: ‘I asked my friend, “How does she have a car like that?”. And she said, “Oh I think she trades in stocks and shares”.

‘So I came home and Googled “trading” and started messing about and having a play.’

Thanks to speedy broadband internet, anyone can buy or sell stocks or bet on currency fluctuations on their home computer or laptop. 

For Mrs Wilkinson-Tancock, it means she can juggle caring for her three children, her £25-an-hour part-time nursing job and the dream of getting rich quick.

She said: ‘I probably do spend too much time on it. It is like an addictive computer game.

‘I can fit it round my family life, although it can be tricky when the children want to watch a film just as I’m about to do a big trade.

‘I find the best time to trade is between 1pm, when the American markets wake up, and 5pm, when the British markets go to bed. There seems to be a lot of volatility then. But I have to pick up the children from school at 3.30pm, so I often have to drag myself away.

‘Sometimes I stay up late at night so I can concentrate properly for a few hours.’

Mrs Wilkinson-Tancock, who is featured in new BBC2 documentary Traders: Millions By The Minute, taught herself about the stock exchange with YouTube videos. She then started ‘dummy trading’ on a website that allowed her to bet on the real international currency markets with imaginary money.

In a year, she had made a theoretical £1.8million, with a starting base of £300,000, just by guessing which currencies would go up, and which down.

Mrs Wilkinson-Tancock, 43, says she has made around £1,000 since she started trading, but admits her success it is more down to luck than judgement

She then raised £6,000 to start trading with real money.

In her first day, she made £99.50. On her second, she made £105.

But on the third, she lost £350 when she accidentally traded £30 instead of £3, and forgot to put on a ‘stop loss’ to limit her exposure to the market.

At one point, her fund went down to £3,856, but she claims that after six weeks of real trading she has made around £1,000 in total.

Mrs Wilkinson-Tancock admits her success has more to do with luck than skill. ‘I know this is just betting under a more acceptable name – it is betting for the middle-classes,’ she said.

‘I’m not very good with numbers. But what I’ve learned to do is literally just look at the chart and guess, and think which way it’s going to go.’

According to the BBC2 programme, only 10 per cent of the 100,000 retail traders in Britain make a consistent profit.

While Mrs Wilkinson-Tancock, from Devon, would like a smart new car, she says her real aim is to make enough money to allow her more time with husband Alan, a 44-year-old sales account manager, and their three children, Charlotte, seven, Rufus, five, and Chloe, four.

‘When you’re a working mum, you’re meant to be able to juggle everything,’ she said. ‘What I’d really like is more time to spend with my family. I don’t need a fancy lifestyle or foreign holidays.’

Traders: Millions By The Minute starts on Monday at 9pm on BBC2.
