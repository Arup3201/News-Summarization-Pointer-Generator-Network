An Oregon family who became desperately ill after unknowingly buying a former meth lab is delivering a petition to Freddie Mac demanding it check all its properties for the drug's residue.

Beth and Jonathan Hankins bought the foreclosed home in Klamath Falls from the government-sponsored housing organisation this summer for just $36,500 - but had no idea about its history.

Within days of moving into the property with their infant son, Ezra, they began experiencing breathing problems and, after weeks, they were struck with agonizing mouth sores, nose bleeds and migraines.

'We mostly experienced extreme dry mouth and had mouth sores, making it extremely painful to even drink water,' Mr Hankins told ABC News.

They were about to call the doctor when a neighbour revealed
the truth about the home's previous tenants and just as 
quickly as they had taken ill, their dream purchase became their 
nightmare.

They bought a $50 testing kit and found that the house on 2427 Radcliffe was
not only a meth lab but that its contamination level was nearly 80 
times higher than the Oregon Health Authority limit.

The couple promptly moved in with relatives before renting another property nearby, and now lament that they are facing financial ruin.

More than they bargained for: The Klamath Falls, Oregon house on Radcliffe was visibly in need of repair but methamphetamine toxins are invisible and they had no idea of the property's history

Mr and Mrs Hankins, the owner of a coffee house and an ER
nurse,  had bought the home from Freddie Mac for what
they considered a steal, even though they knew it needed work.

'We said, "It needs a little bit of love, but it's got good bones,"' Jonathan Hankins toldÂ Yahoo News. 'We just had no idea that those bones were poisonous - the walls were poisoning us.'

After learning of its former use as a meth labl, they contacted Freddie Mac to find out why they had not been told.

They learned the local authorities had not contacted the Oregon Health Authority, as is customary, as there had not been any recent drug-related enforcement actions at the home, ABC reported.

Freddie Mac said it encourages buyers to check federal agency listings kept about meth labs, but the Hankins said the organisation only encouraged them to test how structurally secure the home was.

Superficial: Before disaster struck, Jonathan Hankins and his two-year-old son Ezra painted the walls of their new home thinking they only had to make minor repairs and give the house a little love to resurrect it

Good as new? The Hankins spent about $5,000 on upgrading rooms like the bathroom before discovering the shocking news about their beloved home

Decline: Beth Hankins, an ER nurse, started experiencing breathing problems before her husband started suffering from migraines and nosebleeds and Ezra developed mouth sores

The couple is delivering a petition to Freddie Mac's New York offices to ask the organisation to require testing of homes for meth residue before they are sold.

The Hankins said they are also considering taking legal action against Freddie Mac.

Though in 23 states, including Oregon,
laws require sellers to disclose if a property was ever used as a 
clandestine drug laboratory, Freddie Mac claims it had no idea of the 
Klamath Falls house's history.

And because they sold it 'as is' to 
the Hankins family, it is no longer their responsibility to clean up or 
contribute to the costs associated with the disastrous discovery.

Freddie
Mac spokesman Brad German told ABC: 'We certainly empathize with the 
situation, but we had no prior information about the way the home had 
been used. If we had, of course, we would have disclosed it.'

Unaware: Within days of moving in, Beth started developing breathing problems and just weeks later, the couple's son Ezra, started getting mouth sores and was unable to drink water

Kicked out: A neighbour told them the home had been a meth lab and the couple moved out

Joe
Mazzuca of Meth Lab Cleanup admitted that even with disclosure laws, 
only one in ten labs are busted and since the toxins are invisible 'you 
don't always see the meth residue.'

'It's extremely dangerous stuff,' he said of methamphetamine.

He also explained that information 
regarding the history of a property routinely falls through the cracks 
by the time the bank or government agency has reached the point of 
foreclosure.

According
to Mr Mazzuca he receives calls from people in exactly the same 
position as the Hankins every three to five minutes and recently heard 
from a man in Michigan who unknowingly bought a contaminated home that 
killed his 14-year-old daughter after two years.

Mr
Hankins meanwhile is less willing to let Freddie Mac off the hook for 
their part in the sale and vented his frustration on a petition on Change.org, which now has more than 200,000 signatures.

Trouble: The local authority did not alert the Oregon Health Authority about the meth lab, like that pictured, before the house was sold as there had been no recent law enforcement action at the house

The Hankins will deliver a petition to Freddie Mac headquarters demanding they take more responsibility

Posting an online petition to try and
hold them accountable for the costs of the clean up, he wrote: 'Freddie
Mac advertises, "Our qualifying homes come with a reviewed title, and a
repaired living space making them easier to sell and improving home 
values in your territory. We sell our homes responsibly. Freddie Mac is 
committed to having the best property maintenance and sales standards in
the country."

'We had 
no reason to expect otherwise. Instead, they irresponsibly sold us a 
ticking time bomb of dangerous chemicals without even telling us.'

But
attorneys are insisting that the 'as-is' fine print is what will 
ultimately leave the $5,000 to $15,000 clean-up burden on Mr Hankins' 
shoulders.

A quote he has been given sets the cost at more than the house is worth.
