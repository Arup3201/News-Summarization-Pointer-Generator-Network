An army veteran suffering from PTSD and a lung condition is suing Asda after he was wrongly accused of being a shoplifter in the middle of a store.

Derek Greenhalgh was browsing in a busy Blackpool branch of the discount chain when a manager approached and told him he was barred for stealing, adding 'I know your face'.

When the 66-year-old protested, the manager called two members of staff over and asked them whether they recognised him, as other shoppers looked on.

When the staff said they weren't sure Mr Greenhalgh was the shoplifter in question, the manager backed off, but the British Army veteran said the incident has left him feeling 'humiliated'.

Derek Greenhalgh, 66, said he was approached in this Blackpool branch of Asda on New Year's eve and accused of being a shoplifter by a manager who told him 'I know your face'

He contacted the Veteran's Association who sent a stinging letter to Asda chief executive Andy Clarke branding his treatment a 'disgrace', and he is now in contact with a solicitor.

Mr Greenhalgh, a father-of-one, said: 'I was completely humiliated and left feeling worthless after what happened in that store. 

'It was just indescribable and it knocked me for six. It was distressing and embarrassing. I can understand if mistakes are made but the staff could have asked for a quiet word in the back. 

'There was no need to brand me a criminal in the middle of the store in front of all those customers. It’s not a question of me being an army veteran - no customer should be subjected to this.'

Mr Greenhalgh was left suffering from PTSD after serving in Yemen during a bloody uprising against British colonial rule in 1966.

Mr Greenhalgh visits in the Asda store regularly, as a lung condition stops him from carrying heavy shopping, but has vowed never to return

Soldiers stationed in an area then known as Aden were subjected to 500 guerrilla attacks in 1965, and in 1966 the situation deteriorated even further after it was announced forces would withdraw.

Mr Greenhalgh was approached by the manager on New Year's Eve as he made a trip to the Asda store on Welbeck Avenue, in Blackpool, to buy bread, milk and cat food.

Mr Greenhalgh said he regularly visits the store as he suffers from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a narrowing of the airways that causes shortness of breath, meaning he cannot carry a large amount of shopping.

He said: 'I go to the little Asda because I have to do my shopping in bits and bobs. All the staff know me and I always have a laugh with the ones on the till.

'It was 10:45am and the store was very busy. I was stood near the freezer cabinet and I had my basket when the assistant manager said to me "you’re barred". 

'I said "what for" and he said he didn’t know. I asked who had barred me and he said he didn’t know. He said that he knew faces and I said "well you have the wrong face".

'I said "you can’t tell me who, where and when" and I asked for some of his frontline staff to identify me. Then the security guard said "have you ever been done for shoplifting". I said "no". 

'Then two other staff came over and one said "I’m not certain" and the other said "I’m not certain but I don’t think it is him". 

'I remember people stopping and staring at me. The manager said ‘if I’m wrong I will apologise’ but I told him that I was taking it further.

'I paid for my shopping and went home and rang customer services. I was shaking and fuming. I couldn’t get it out of my head and my mood was very low after. I was extremely upset and offended.

At the time of Mr Greenhalgh's deployment the British forces were being targetted by guerrilla fighters demanding an end to colonial rule (Mr Greenhalgh pictured middle row, second from left)

'I have depression with traumatic stress disorder and it does get you down to the point where you can’t be bothered to go out and get dressed but I had been on the up. 

'I had been thinking positively and I was feeling more positive than I had done for quite a long time, but this completely devastated me.

'This assistant manager was adamant "because he goes off faces" that I was the right person but as soon as he couldn’t get a positive identity he started to back off. 

'He had mistaken me for shoplifter and it was the way it was handled in front of everyone. People were staring. I was shellshocked.

'When he first said it I honestly thought it was a joke but he was deadly serious. I think that treatment was disgusting. 

'It was very traumatising, embarrassing and very distressing, I didn’t need this. why couldn’t they take me into the back and done it in private.

Mr Greenhalgh (pictured third left during Army training in 1965) said he was on a positive streak before the manager approached him, but the incident left him 'devastated'

'I think that they should look at their protocol. I was extremely upset and offended.

'Immediately after it happened I would not go shopping and obviously I don’t go into Asda any more because I’ll be worried the staff are thinking ‘oh looks it’s him’. 

'I’ve been a loyal customer at Asda for 15 years and spend between £150 and £200 a week there but they won’t be getting a penny out of me now.

'Asda has been disgusting. Customer services say they understand my embarrassment - but they don’t have a clue. I’m now seeing a solicitor.'

Mr Greenhalgh (pictured in 1985) forgives the mistake, but said he should have been taken off the shop floor before being accused

Mr Greenhalgh served as a private in the First Battalion the Loyal North Lancaster Regiment for four years after joining in 1965 aged 17, and served in Aden in 1966, North Africa in 1967 and Malta. He later served in the 4th Battalion Queen’s Lancashire Regiment and in the Territorial Army.

Tony Hayes, chief executive of the Veterans’ Association UK said: 'Derek suffers from PTSD and this doesn’t help - it makes things 10 times worse. What makes you or I angry, he can become anxious and frightened. It’s an absolute disgrace.

'He was in bits. We have all been through the mill and understand the problem. Derek has virtually gone back to where he was in the first place.

'It has totally devastated him and humiliated him. He has almost become paranoid about it and going out. When he goes out he is embarrassed because he thinks people are thinking he is a shoplifter. It is totally unfair.

'The assistant manager should be sacked because what he has done is totally wrong.'

In an email to Mr Greenhalgh a staff member from the Asda ‘Service Team’ said: 'I hope the same mistake will never occur in the future. I appreciate your feedback as it helps us to work on drawbacks and put things right.”

In a statement an Asda spokesman said: 'We have the greatest respect for our armed service personnel and are privileged to count many ex-service men and women as Asda colleagues.

'We are very sorry for any distress this has caused and have been in touch with Mr Greenhalgh to apologise for this case of mistaken identity. We have also contacted the Veterans’ Association UK to explain what happened.'
