Six months ago, Ruby the Jack Russell was so fat walkies was a short waddle that left her out of breath.

She piled on the pounds and ended up looking like a barrel on four legs as her owners misguidedly stuffed the former rescue dogs with treats.

In fact, the only thing that would make her spring into action was the prospect of more food - and when not asleep, begging for more was about as active as she got.

Porky: Ruby piled on the pounds and looked like a barrel on four legs after she ate lots of dog treats

But now the five-year-old is far friskier and in the best of health after shedding a third of her bodyweight.

Yesterday the trimmed down terrier was named winner of the Pet Slimmer of the Year award.

At her heaviest, she tipped the scales at 1stone 6lbs, making her morbidly obese, before going on a diet and fitness regime run by charity PDSA.

Now she weighs just under a 1stone, is near her ideal weight - and has shed a staggering 7inches from her waist.

Her owner Angela Martin, 40, of Sunderland, took her in four years ago after an animal shelter had found her roaming the streets and she, husband Stephen, also 40, and children Laura, 22, and Lewis, 18, began to lavish Ruby with treats.

Mrs Martin said: 'When Ruby first came to us, we all felt really sorry for her as she'd had such a tough start to life. So to compensate, we used to give her a little treat here and there.

'The trouble was, the whole family was giving her 'a little treat' and over time, she started to get really big.' Ruby not only gobbled up the treats, but also became a scavenger.

On one occasion she made herself ill by stealing a 'phall' chicken curry from the kitchen bin which Mr Martin had thrown away - because it was too hot for him to eat.

Mrs Martin, who has health problems and is cared for by her husband, said: 'Winning the competition is wonderful, but the real prize is seeing Ruby enjoying a new lease of life tearing around the garden and playing with her toys.'

PDSA senior veterinary surgeon Elaine Pendlebury said: 'Many people fall into the trap of overindulging their pet with food as a way of expressing their love.

Angela and her family have worked really hard and have shown that it's never too late to make a positive change.'

Also among the finalists was sweet-toothed cat Prince, aged six, who ballooned to 1stone 2lb - due to his love of ice cream and Indian sweets. His weight dropped to 1 stone 1lb after being put on a diet.

Owner Farrah Allarakha, of Derby, said: 'The whole family treats him like royalty and he would give us the big eyes whenever he wanted something - it was so hard to resist.'
