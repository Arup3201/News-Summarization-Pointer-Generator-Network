A couple tied the knot wearing clothes donated to the charity shop where they met and fell in love.

Volunteers Ann Davies and Pete Edwards chose their outfits from the Wales Air Ambulance shop, in Wrexham, North Wales, and invited charity mascots to attend their big day.

The couple got together after Miss Davies, 55, visited the shop in February, where she first met her shop assistant partner Mr Edwards, 42.

Big day: Ann Davies and Pete Edwards were joined by Wales Ambulance Service mascots for their wedding after meeting at the charity's shop

Happy couple: The pair got engaged just 10 days after meeting at the charity shop in Wrexham, North Wales

Friends at the store lent a hand with the wedding, having bought everything for the big day from stock donated to the charity shop including the couple’s outfits, wedding decorations, flowers and furniture.

Wales Air Ambulance even chipped in to help with their wedding transport, lending one of its charity vans to take the couple to their wedding breakfast at the Wrexham and District War Memorial Club.

After first meeting, the couple, who now live together in the town's Caia Park area, exchanged numbers and arranged a dinner date.

They got engaged on Valentine’s Day, 10 days after their first meeting. Since announcing their nuptials, Miss Davies has joined Mr Edwards as a volunteer at the shop.

As well as assisting with the couple’s transport on the big day, Wales Air Ambulance mascots Elliecopter and Huw HEMS also joined in the celebrations.

'They’re both really pleased and it’s Pete’s birthday too. I was quite choked myself during the ceremony'

Sharon Jones, Wrexham Wales Air Ambulance shop manager

Wrexham Wales Air Ambulance shop manager Sharon Jones said: 'It’s been a fantastic day, I’m so proud of both of them.

'Peter has been working for us for two years and Ann joined in April after they got engaged. They’re both really pleased and it’s Pete’s birthday too. I was quite choked myself during the ceremony.

'Everything for the wedding has come from the shop from their outfits to the flowers and decorations. Pete came to the wedding in the Wales Air Ambulance van and it took them to the wedding breakfast.'

She added: 'I really do wish them all the luck in the world, they deserve it.'
