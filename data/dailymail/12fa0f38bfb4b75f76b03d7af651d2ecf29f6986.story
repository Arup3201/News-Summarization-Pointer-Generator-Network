New Jersey Governor Chris Christie admitted today that he's avoiding questions about certain national issues because he's worried about giving 'ill-informed' answers that will bite him in the rear if he runs for president in 2016.

Christie told CNBC's John Harwood that he won't 'pretend' to have an opinion on issues he hasn't studied such as the Export-Import Bank just because it's a hot topic and people want to know what he thinks.

But 'if and when there's a time that comes that I
 need to be telling people in this country what my view is on those 
issues, I will,' he promised.

'If I run for president, you can be sure that I'll have an opinion,' Christie said in comments first reported by Business Insider.

New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said today he's purposefully withholding his opinion on salient national issues because he's 'ill-informed'

'But until that time I think it's quite frankly immature 
to be expressing a lot of those opinions just because I'm sitting up 
here in front of this room and you asked,' Christie said, taking a shot across the bow at his contemporaries.

'You can ask whatever you like, I don't have to answer,' he said, taking on a defensive tone.

Harwood expressed disbelief that Christie's been 'ducking' questions about federal issues because he's ignorant, but Christie told him with a straight face that was truly the case.

'Believe me, you can't imagine how ill-informed I am,' Christie said, prompting laughter from the audience.

'If I don't think my answer is going to be smart and will stand the 
test of time, you can be damned sure that I'm not going to answer, he said, 'because you'll have this tape and you'll use it.'

Christie made the last remark with a grin, indicating that he was half-joking.

While
 the line was made partly in jest, the Republican Governor hit on a 
serious point: comments he makes now on federal issues open him up to 
future attacks by his opponents should he seek higher office. Changing 
his position on major political issues before or after he announces his 
intentions to run for president could be politically damaging, too.

Christie told CNBC's John Harwood in an-onstage interview at the Delivering Alpha Conference in New York that he'll share his opinion on the issues if he decides to run for president, but he hasn't made a decision yet

During the interview Christie wouldn't commit to running for president, but the two-term governor confirmed that he's still considering it, despite political woes stemming from a government employee's decision to purposefully cause a traffic jam on a busy bridge last year.

'I've been pretty clear, you know, I 
certainly am going to consider it, but whether I do it or not is 
something that I honestly don't know yet,' he claimed after Harwood asked him about his intentions at the beginning of the interview.

The father of four noted that his children, ages 11 through 20, are 'relatively' young, and that's something that continues to weigh on his mind.

Christie said he honestly wasn't in a hurry to make any decisions about his political future and cautioned the audience against politicians who are, ribbing his potential opponents once again.

'The fact is that you should beware of people in 
my opinion are overanxious to make that decision before they need to.

'That would seem to indicate to me 
ambition over wisdom,' he said, 'and I don't think that's what you want in the 
person sitting in the Oval Office.'
