Alvaro Morata appears to have quickly got over the disappointment of not making Spain's World Cup squad as he enjoyed his summer break with friends on a yacht.

The highly-rated Real Madrid striker, who has been strongly linked with a £10million move to Arsenal, posted a picture on Instagram of himself with friends enjoying a sunshine break on the liner.

The 21-year-old was not selected for Spain’s World Cup squad despite having starred for the Under-21 side that won last summer’s European Championships and being part of the Real Madrid squad that secured Champions League glory.

The reigning World and European champions lost both of the opening group fixtures and were one of the first sides eliminated from the tournament.

Morata has been a revelation for Spain's under-19 and 21 sides

Morata, who scored his first Champions League goal against Schalke in March, is reportedly allowed to leave the Bernabeu this summer and is known to be one of Arsene Wenger’s top targets.

Madrid boss Carlo Ancelotti said: 'The player wants to look for an opportunity where he can play more and the club agrees with this.

'If he leaves it would be good that he would have the chance to play. If Morata goes we have to think about getting a young forward with the same characteristics.'

If Madrid sell Morata then they would look for a deal with a buy-back clause.
