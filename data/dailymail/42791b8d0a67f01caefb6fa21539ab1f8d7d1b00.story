A Hollywood skin specialist to the stars accused of plotting to kill her main competitor in a 'murder-for-hire' scheme is now accused of trying to hire neo-nazis to take the man out.

A Los Angeles Police detective testified Monday in court that Dawn DaLuise, 55, tried to hire a white supremacist group to kill rival esthetician Gabriel Suarez because he is a 'double minority.'

Suarez, a gay Latino, told KTLA outside the courtroom that 'it's just really scary... the hate this person could have.

Smile for the camera!: Dawn DaLuise cracks a grin while sitting during a Monday court hearing

The victim: Gabriel Suarez told reporters outside court the though of someone wanting him dead is 'really scary'

DaLuise smiled as she walked into the courtroom wearing a blue jail jumpsuit. The hearing was to determine if she would face a trial on one count of solicitation of murder.

The half-day hearing featured testimony from a number of people, including an LAPD detective who caught on to her scheme and averted possible tragedy.

'In one instance … she asked him if he could get her in contact with a white supremacist group, and the phrase from that point was, in essence, to find somebody to take out a ‘double minority Mexican gay,’ said the officer.

The troubled woman also tried to make it appear as if Suarez was stalking her online, jurors were told.

The problems started 
when Suarez opened an office in the same Santa Monica building as
 her salon, Skin Refinery.

Previous reports suggested DaLuise, who has counted Jennifer Aniston, Sarah 
Michelle Gellar and Christian Slater among clients, made Craigslist postings inviting men to turn up unannounced at the home of Gabriel Suarez for 'trysts', according to a series of text messages seen by RadarOnline. 

Dawn DaLuise, (left in her mugshot) a skincare specialist to the stars,
 allegedly posted fake gay sex ads about her competitor GabrielSuarez (right), it was previously revealed

It was previously reported that DaLuise hired a former Detroit Lions player Chris Geile as a hit man to kill the competitor. He has not been arrested or charged and denies involvement.

The explosive allegations revealed that DaLuise texted a friend: 'I’m putting a posting up abt (sic) him 
wanting sex on CL [Craigslist] this week (only well hung black men need 
apply!).'

In another she allegedly wrote: 'I am putting together a CL (Craigslist) 
ad to run soon directing guys to Gabriel’s front door. No need to call 
first! Just show up; I’ll be waiting in bed with an (sic) blindfold on!'

DeLuise allegedly told the friend that in the ad, she encouraged men to barge into Suarez's home and claimed that he would be waiting in bed wearing a blindfold. 

DaLuise also reportedly told her friend that she intended to go to Starbucks to set up the Craigslist ads so that her IP address could not be traced.

According to the Radar report, she also suggested stalking Suarez's sister.

In a bizarre twist, the friend to whom DaLuise sent the text messages, Edward Feinstein, 28, has been arrested for stalking her.

Feinstein allegedly made flyers with a sexually explicit photo of DaLuise's face, home address, phone number and distributed them publicly. 

He is also accused of making his own fake Craigslist ads pretending that DaLuise wanted men to help her act out a 'rape fantasy', according to the Los Angeles County Sheriff.

Feinstein was released on bond and is due to appear in court on May 14.

DaLuise believed that the person who made the ads about her was Suarez - and the threat to her and her daughters' safety was her motivation for the murder-for-hire plot, she has claimed.

A representative for DaLuise previously told MailOnline they did not have a comment.

According to her website, DaLuise moved to California to become a model in the 1980s.

Driven
 by her own sun-damaged skin, she enrolled in beauty school in the 1990s
 and treats clients with electrical muscule stimulation, rather than 
'steams and creams'.

Her 
Electrical Muscle Stimulation facials cost $125 a session and claim to 
help dru skin, wrinkles or damage from chemical peels. A 40-minute 
facial costs $80, while wax treatments cost up to $90.

DaLuise also includes Freddie Prinze Jr., Alicia Silverstone, Alyson Hannigan, Christina Ricci, Kyra Sedwick and Bridget Moynahan among her clients.
