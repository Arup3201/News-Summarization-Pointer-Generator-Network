The Hells Angels have claimed they are the victims of trademark infringement after a retailer released a clothing line using a logo similar to the bikers' Death Head.

The group has filed a lawsuit for an unspecified amount against rapper Young Jeezy's 8732 Apparel line and Dillard's stores for making and selling hats, shirts and vests 'confusingly similar' to Hells Angels symbols.

The international motorcycle club owns 
four U.S. trademark registrations for the winged skull logo and patch, 
which is used to signify membership.

Department store Dillard's and the 8732 clothing line are accused of seeking to exploit the 'great commercial value' of the designs for their own gain the lawsuit claims, according to MySanAntonio.

'Guys live and die for that patch. It's not just a piece of clothing,' Fritz Clapp, the Hells Angels' attorney, said.

Although not a member of the bikers' group, Mr Clapp has represented them in trademark infringement cases for the past 20 years.

'As one of the retailers they are subject to the same prosecution that the manufacturer is for an infringement,' Mr Clapp told News 10, as he referred to Dillard's, which is listed in the lawsuit along with 20 unnamed individuals.

The Death Head logo of the Hells Angels was created by former San Francisco charter president Frank Sadliek.

It features a winged skull wearing a motorcycle helmet and the letters MC for Motorcycle Club.

The trademark-protected logo was inspired by Second World War bombing squadrons 85th Fighter and 52nd Bomb, which featured a winged skull on either a sky background or riding a missile.

Arvid Olson of the Flying Tigers Hells Angels squadron suggested the name to founders of the motorbike club in California after the war, according to the Hells Angels website.

The patch featuring the logo and numbers 81 - representing the numerical place of H and A in the alphabet - signifies that a biker has earned the right to be a full member of the international club.

The group, once described by the U.S. Justice Department as an 'outlaw motorcycle gang', said it has consistently used the design mark of the Death Head - a skull with wings - coupled with the words Hells Angels, and is the victim of trademark infringement.

The patch design is significant, proving that a biker has earned the right to be a full member of the club.

Its design was inspired by insignia attached to two Second World War bombing squadrons.

The official Death Head design for Hells Angels was created by former president of the club's San Francisco Charter Frank Sadliek.

On the jackets, T-Shirts and hats in the 8732 clothing line, which are claimed to be similar to the logo, a mask with wings features with the words 'Street Bandits Eight Seven'.

The clothing line was created by 
Atlanta rapper Young Jeezy for 8732, said to be an acronym for United 
Street Dope Boys. The brand takes its inspiration from hip-hop and '
hustlers' on urban streets.

According
 to the Hells Angels lawsuit, the alleged acts of infringement have been
 committed with the intent to cause confusion, mistake or deception and 
are in violation of federal statutes.

The
 clothing brand and store have been asked to hand over the items and 
their inventories to a mutually selected third party for 'supervised 
destruction'.
