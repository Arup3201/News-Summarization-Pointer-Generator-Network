A nightclub owner has spoken out to deny claims Chris Brown attacked a woman at his venue.

Deanna Gines alleges that the incident, which Brown's camp have denied, was so bad she now may need to undergo surgery.

However owner Mike Joher has said the alleged assault on Saturday night in the Heat Ultra Lounge in Anaheim, California, did not happen.

Accusation: Deanna Gines (L) is alleging she was assaulted by Chris Brown in a nightclub on Saturday

He said: 'Based on the information which we have gathered from our security company, mall security and other party goers which were at HEAT on Saturday night; It is apparent that the alleged incident regarding Chris Brown is false.

'We know that the claimant was trying to jump on stage and security was doing their job by keeping people away from Chris.

'There was no way that he could have touched her, his section was roped off and he had heavy security surrounding him.

'Witnesses state that the she was persistently trying to rush Chris. She was eventually removed from the club.'

In fact he claimed she had become violent when she was being escorted out.

Mr Joher said: 'While security was escorting her off the premises, she took off her shoes and threw them at our security. In addition, she continued to cause problems with mall security in the common area and parking lot.

'This type of behavior is not tolerated and is frowned upon. Our last resort was to contact police and have her arrested. However, we allowed her to leave with the people which accompanied her. '

He also said that Brown had been a 'complete gentleman' during his visit to the venue, and that he planned to persue legal action against Gines for 'slandering our name and the artist.'

It comes after Gines told TMZ Brown pushed her to the ground when the bar was about to close.

The 24-year-old alleges that she fell hard on her knees and claims the push was deliberate.

Gines
stated that she went to the hospital following the alleged incident and
was told by doctors that she has torn ligaments in her right knee.

the owner of Heat Ultra Lounge in Anaheim told Mail Online: 'Based on 
the information which we have gathered from our security company, mall 
security, and other party goers which at HEAT on Saturday night; It is 
apparent that the alleged incident regarding Chris Brown is false.'

They
say Gines had repeatedly tried to jump on stage during Chris' 
performance at the club - and later tried to rush Chris in his roped-off
VIP area.

She even threw her heels at security when they tried to eject her.

The website reports that Gines has been informed she may need surgery and is going to see another doctor this week.

The woman shared a photo with the publication in which she can be seen on crutches with her leg in a brace.

Scene of the 'crime': The alleged incident took place at the Heat Ultra Lounge

Gines
claimed to TMZ that she filed a police report and the according to the 
website a representative for the Anaheim Police Department has confirmed
a report was filed by a female that evening.

However the publication states the representative has not disclosed the name in the report for assault.

A representative for Brown told Mail Online: 'Chris didn't do this. The club also says they are unaware of this happening. Everyone with Chris knows nothing about this.

'The girl has not come in in-person to The Anaheim Police Station and she would not go into details with the police regarding her injuries - she only told them that she was pushed. She said all of this over the phone. She also didn’t call the police at the time she's saying the alleged assault happened.'

Brown's representative added: 'We’re getting statement from the club. Turns out this person was wasted and threw her shoe at club security so they started filming her for liability reasons. Trying to get that footage.'

Brown was famously charged with assaulting then-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009.
