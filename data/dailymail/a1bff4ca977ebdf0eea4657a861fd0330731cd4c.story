Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell says he knows in his heart he's innocent of the federal corruption charges he's facing.

The former governor finished his third day of testifying Friday at federal court in Richmond by proclaiming his innocence and saying he would never corrupt his office in exchange for gifts.

McDonnell and his wife, Maureen, are charged with accepting more than $165,000 from former Star Scientific Inc. CEO Jonnie Williams in exchange for promoting his products.

McDonnell said he had thought Williams was a true friend and accused him of making false statements in court.

McDonnell says he should have disclosed some of the gifts from a wealthy vitamin entrepreneur on a yearly financial disclosure form.

McDonnell testified Friday at his corruption trial in Richmond.

He says he should have disclosed a golf bag emblazoned with the Notre Dame logo and two golf outings Williams paid for in 2011.

As governor, McDonnell was required to file a yearly disclosure of his income, debts and gifts.

The former governor says that the omissions were not intentional and that he was not trying to keep Williams' gifts hidden from the public.

The former governor is expected to resume testifying on Monday.

McDonnell has moved out of his home and is living 
with a priest at a rectory instead, he has revealed during his 
corruption trial.

Close: McDonnell said he did not believe his wife Maureen had an affair with Williams, both pictured, but that he had realized her connection with the businessman had been much deeper than he thought

McDonnell
 left the home he shared with his wife of 38 years, Maureen, the week 
before their trial began, he revealed as he testified extensively about 
their troubled relationship on Thursday.

He
 said that although he only recently left the home, he concluded that 
his marriage was over in September 2011 after he became angry and 
exhausted at the relationship.

On 
Thursday, the former governor testified that he had written a long email
 to his wife three years ago trying to save his marriage, calling her 
his 'soulmate' - yet he also said he grew so weary of her yelling that 
he began taking refuge in his office late at night rather than go home.

At first, 
he thought they shared a natural bond over dietary supplements - Maureen
 McDonnell had sold nutritional supplement for decades as a part-time 
business.

She was crushed when he told her it would be inappropriate to 
continue selling vitamins as first lady, he said.

McDonnell
 testified that he doesn't believe his wife had an affair with Williams,
 but that they had developed an intense, emotional connection to which 
he had been oblivious.
