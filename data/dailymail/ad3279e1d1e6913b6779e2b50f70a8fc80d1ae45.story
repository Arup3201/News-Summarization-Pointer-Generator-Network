Even the cops were impressed when they broke up a secret party thrown on the Manhattan Bridge last Saturday.

The romp was organized by 19-year-old Bensonhurst resident Alexander Shlaferman, an NYU dropout and toy company owner who goes by the name Alex Xander.

He's been throwing 'Xandernation' parties in unusual locations for the past year, each time trying to out do the last.

The right to party: A 19-year-old Brooklyn party organizer was arrested for throwing a party attended by hundreds on the Manhattan Bridge last Saturday

If Gatsby were a hipster: 19-year-old Alexander Shlaferman, aka Alex Xander, has been bankrolling secret parties for over a year with money earned from his toy business

His first party was for July 4, 2012, when he wanted to organize something for teenagers who had nowhere to go and has since organized a total of five parties planned around unique locations.

Past party locations include an air hangar, an old airport and a few warehouses.

For one party, Shlaferman and his friends went all out turning an abandoned field into a circus complete with fireworks, bouncy castles and mechanical bulls.

'We come and we go. We clean up, and we're out of there,' Shlaferman told the New York Daily News. 'Anyone can throw a party in a nightclub, it's all about finding these weird places that make the party extraordinary.

All of Shlaferman's parties are free thanks to his toy business.

'I pay for everything out of pocket, and I’m kind of like the Great Gatsby when it comes stuff like this,' he told CBS New York. 'I just like making people happy.'

While he admits it's not the first party ever thrown on the Manhattan Bridge, he does think it was the most developed with lighting and a sound system.

The party started around 10pm on the pedestrian thoroughfare on the Brooklyn side of the bridge.

Gothamist estimates around 400 people were there by 11:30pm. Shlaferman said it was more like 600 and that photos made it look like 1,000.

At 12:40pm police arrived and broke up the party, arrested Shlaferman as well as the DJ-duo known as 'Bear Sauce': Brendon Risano, 23, and Giacomo Nacci, 20. 

Shlaferman wasn't upset about getting arrested, saying: 'I thought I would get arrested five parties ago. I've been prepared to be arrested.'

The three men were charged with criminal nuisance, trespassing, reckless endangerment and disorderly conduct.

But they also got some compliments from the cops.

After being released from jail, Shlaferman posted about the experience on Facebook:

Out of jail: The cops were very impressed with Shlaferman's party

Shlaferman says he isn't currently planning any future pop-up parties.
