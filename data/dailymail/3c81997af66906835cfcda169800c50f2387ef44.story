The emotional toll endured by emergency room medics has been revealed by a moving photograph showing an ER doctor consumed by grief after losing a teenage patient.

The image was posted to a website by a friend and colleague of the doctor who explained that a 19-year-old he was trying to save passed away.

The doctor, wearing a white coat, is seen crouching down by the side of a road at night, with one hand holding a wall - the heart-ache of what he'd seen clearly too much to bear.

An image of a doctor overwhelmed by grief after losing a 19-year-old patient has generated thousands of comments on a social media site

The poster, who works in California, said: 'Though this is a common occurrence in our field of work, the patients we lose are typically old, sick, or some combination of the two. The patient that died was 19 years old, and for him, it was one of those calls we get sometimes that just hits you.'

The picture was first published on Reddit and has led to thousands of comments from touched users.

One, ‘J-Hof’, wrote that the image ‘really hit home’ as it reminded him of the shock felt by ER medics after they failed to save his father’s life.

The post read: ‘When he died the doctors who were working on him at the UCSD medical center were crushed. I could definitely see it in their eyes. They called my house multiple times throughout the year to see how my family was doing. Doctors do not get the praise they deserve.’

Reddit user Facetus, a medic, wrote: ‘I know exactly how the doc in the picture feels. Despite the picture showing such a dark moment it actually makes me feel happier about my career choice. I think it is the sense of connection with the unknown doc in the pic and the comments and reaction of Reddit community that makes me feel: what we do matters.’

Another user, livinbandit, said: ‘My dad is an ER doctor. I remember the times he would come home and cry in my mother’s arms because there was someone that he couldn't save no matter how hard he tried.’
