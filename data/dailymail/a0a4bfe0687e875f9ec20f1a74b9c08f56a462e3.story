A 22st pub landlord who was run down by thugs for trying to stop an alleged drugs deal was saved from potentially life-threatening injuries thanks to his beer belly, doctors have said.

Tony Morgan, 44, the licensee of the Poachers Pocket in Chatham, Kent, was struck down when he confronted the crooks in his car park.

Shocking CCTV shows the moment the suspects smashed their grey Peugeot 307 into the father-of-three, catapulting him 15ft into the air.

Getting his point across: As the Peugeot leaves the car park, the former boxer continues to berate the yobs

Mr Morgan had to be treated for broken ribs at Medway Maritime Hospital, where doctors told him he was saved by his beer belly.

Medics said the former boxer’s excess body fat and muscle provided 'padding' which helped cushion his bones and vital organs from the impact.

Doctors said a skinnier man would have been much more seriously hurt.

In CCTV issued by Kent Police, Tony can be seen approaching the driver’s door and arguing with the alleged dealer.

Shockingly, the driver punches Mr Morgan through the window and attempts to speed off - with Mr Morgan still clinging onto the car.

But the driver then suddenly reverses - smashing into Mr Morgan - sending him flying through the air.

Hospitalised: The father-of three suffered crack ribs and bruising after landing on the concrete

The car, believed to be a hire vehicle from a London firm, was then driven off at high speed as Mr Morgan lies slumped on the ground

Mr Morgan, who has run the pub for 13 years with wife Lorraine, 45, said: 'I said "that’s a drug deal, I’m not having that".

'I approached as the passenger got out and said "don’t come here to buy your drugs, do it somewhere else".

'I heard the wheels spinning and the next thing I knew I was up in the air. It knocked me 15 or 20 feet across the car park.

'I suffered bruising and a few cracked ribs. The doctors said I was lucky - if I had been a smaller guy things would’ve been a lot worse.

'Doctors said because of my size and extra weight I have more protection for my vital organs and bones.

'I have a bit more padding then the average man which meant my bones and organ where cushioned from the impact.

Doctors said Mr Morgan would have suffered far worse injuries were it not for his beer belly 'padding' around his midriff

'I have caught people doing drug deals before. People say I should leave it to the police but I can’t just leave it.

'I would do the same again. This is my business for my customers who want to come here and enjoy themselves.'

The car, believed to be a hire vehicle from a London firm, was then driven off at high speed down Walderslade Road towards Chatham, Kent.

The driver is described as black, in his mid-20s, of slim build with black short hair and a thin moustache.

He was wearing a green checked shirt and spoke with a West Indian accent. There was also another man in the passenger seat.

The incident happened at about 12.45pm on Saturday, September 29.

Kent Police are appealing for witnesses and are particularly keen to speak to the man who was in the passenger seat.

DC Mark Silk said: 'This is a serious incident where the injuries could have been a great deal worse.

'Any information will be treated in the strictest confidence and we are interested in speaking to a white man in a brown tracksuit who left the vehicle prior to the incident.'

A 21-year-old man from Peckham was arrested following the attack and was due to answer bail today.
