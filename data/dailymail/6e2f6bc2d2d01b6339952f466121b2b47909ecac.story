Author: Peter Moskos advocates flogging over jail time in his new book

A U.S. academic has written a book advocating the benefits of flogging over sending criminals to prison.

Peter Moskos' book, In Defence of Flogging, outlines the advantages of sentencing criminals to flogging over sending them to jail which, he argues, is an ineffective and cruel form of punishment.

Mr Moskos - who teaches at John Jay College of Criminal Justice - is not advocating the medieval punishment in order to get tougher on criminals but actually the opposite - he believes that the criminal justice system is actually too cruel.

In his book, he reminds readers that there are currently 2.3 million inmates incarcerated in barbaric conditions.

American prisons are bleak and violent, and sexual assault is rampant, he said.

He said it is while inside prison that inmates learn more about committing crime rather than become penitent and turn towards better lives.

According to Time magazine, Mr Moskos argues that convicts should be given a choice - jail time or two lashes for every year of their sentence.

He says that by choosing the latter, convicts would be able to replace soul-crushing years behind bars with intense but short-lived physical pain. When the flogging was over, they could get on with their lives.

Whip: Flogging was widely used in the 19th century in America until the fifties though it is still used in some parts of the world

Speaking about flogging in an interview with Salon, he said: 'Flogging should horrify people. But taking away a significant chunk of 
someone’s life is far worse than any punishment that is virtually 
instantaneous.

'We should be honest about prison and recognize that we’re
sentencing people to years of confinement and torture. But we don’t do 
that. We still have this hogwash about prison being good for the soul.

'Deep down I think we all understand that no one leaves prison in a 
better position than they went in.'

Book: The Defence of Flogging is already proving to be controversial

He is not, of course, suggesting that rapists and murderers be allowed to walk the streets but that this option should be offered to those charged with lesser crimes, something he believes would decrease the prison population from 2.3million to 300,000.

Serious criminals should spend the rest of their lives in jail, he said.

According to Time magazine, the 'lash' was used against slaves and common criminals throughout the 1800s but was used right up until 1952 in America when Delaware administered 20 lashes to a convicted burglar.

In other countries it was used even more recently. In 1994, an American teenager named Michael Fay was convicted of spray-painting cars in Singapore and was flogged as part of his punishment.

Fay's ordeal received intense media attention, with the number of lashes being reduced from six to four after President Clinton appealed.

But as Mr Moskos notes in his book, a newspaper poll in Dayton, Ohio, where Fay's father lived, found that respondents supported the punishment by a 2-1 margin, and at a time of rising juvenile crime, many Americans seemed to echo that sentiment.

Mr Moskos argues that when corporal punishment was outlawed and imprisonment became the justice system's primary tool, almost immediately the penitential system ran aground.

He said that far from repenting, the confinement and boredom made the prisoners crazy.

He argues that prisons are 'vast, inhumane, ineffectual, and incoherent'.

'I can't think of another institution,' he writes, 'that has failed as mightily as the prison has.'

The academic has also written a book on using electric shocks to punish criminals.
