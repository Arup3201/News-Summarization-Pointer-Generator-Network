Nottingham Forest are on the verge on signing Todd Kane on loan from Chelsea.

The 21-year-old defender has performed well for Bristol City in the first half of this season and is making the step up to Championship level with Forest keen to strengthen their full-back areas.

Kane, known to Forest manager Stuart Pearce from England youth levels, has come through the Chelsea academy predominately as a right-back, although he can also play left-back.

The Premier League leaders wanted Kane to get experience at a higher level than League One. He played 28 games on loan at Blackburn Rovers last season, scoring twice.
