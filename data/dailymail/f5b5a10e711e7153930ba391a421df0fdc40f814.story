U.S. talk show host John Oliver has compared the leadership of Prime Minister Tony Abbott to watching a car crash in slow motion.

The host of HBO's Last Week Tonight, a satirical news and current affairs program, called Mr Abbott a 'car crash of a human being' but said that his behaviour was still entertaining to watch. 

'It's like watching a truck jack-knife on a road. It's like, "It didn't crash this time. Let's give it five minutes, then it's going into a ditch",' Oliver said.

The host of HBO's Last Week Tonight called Mr Abbott a 'car crash of a human being' but said that his behaviour was still entertaining to watch

The English-born funny man, who hosted a summer season of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, told The Sydney Morning Herald that Mr Abbott was a fascinating man. 

'The fact he's the leader of a country is in itself appealing as a comic. What's nice is being able to present someone who people have not seen here [in the US] and just to give them a glimpse into other people's pain, as well as their own,' he said.

Oliver has previously lampooned Abbott on Last Week Tonight, featuring the Australian Prime Minister for his 'Other Presidents of the United States' segment in June last year.

The popular HBO show – which has a large online fan base with more than 1.3 million subscribers on YouTube – satirised Mr Abbott's stance on immigration, the way his religious beliefs impact his policies, his views on homosexuality and his comments about women.

The comedian presented a series of clips to suggest reasons why Mr Abbott's approval rating had fallen to 30%, showing a clip from The ABC's Q&A where the Prime Minister discussed his hardline 'stop the boats' policy.

'Jesus knew there was a place for everything and it is not necessarily everyone’s place to come to Australia,' Mr Abbott said.

Oliver's voice-over satirically points out that 'Australia is for real Australians like Tony Abbott, who was born in London, England,' and labelled his 'rhetorical inconsistency' as personally insulting 'everyone in the country'. 

Oliver is also no stranger to Australian politics, having interviewed former prime minister John Howard for his story on gun control while reporting for The Daily Show. 

'I'm not a huge fan of [Howard], so hurting his feelings was not the worst thing that had ever happened to me,' Oliver said, describing the interview as 'bumpy'.

The comedian has also previously labelled Australia one of 'the most comfortably racist places' he had ever visited.

'You can say what you like about Australian racism, it is undeniably specific. I had a couple of Australians – more than one – complain to me about all the ‘Lebbos’ in the country, referring apparently to the Lebanese. Who the f**k is annoyed by Lebanese people?,' he asked in his Bugle podcast.

'How many Lebanese people can there actually be in Australia? There’s only just over four million of these people in f***ing Lebanon,' he said.

'The one thing Australia cannot argue is: there’s no room here in this country because that land is fucking gigantic. That aside, fantastic place, can’t wait to go back.'

Despite his stance on Australian politics and racist proclivities, the 37-year-old said  has previously praised the governments fight to introduce plain packaging to cigarettes. 

In an 18-minute video, Oliver described tobacco as: 'An aging product that's decreasing in popularity and yet somehow, it just can't stop making money. It's basically the agricultural equivalent of U2.'

'Australia's plain packaging laws banned tobacco company branding from packaging and replaced it with upsetting photos such as the toe tag on a corpse, the cancerous mouth, the nightmarish eyeball or the diseased lung,' he said. 

'Perhaps unsurprisingly, since this law was implemented total consumption of tobacco and cigarettes in Australia fell to record lows… and nightmares about eyeballs have risen to record highs.'

The talk show host then went on to suggest a 'compromise' with tobacco companies, allowing them to market their products using 'Jeff the Diseased Lung' as their mascot

He then pointed to a picture of a health warning on a cigarette package and joked: 'Take it down, take down the demon eye!'

Oliver made reference to Australian Department of Health statistics which show that consumption of cigarettes and tobacco fell to their lowest recorded levels ($3.405 billion) in the March quarter of 2014, down from $3.508 billion in the December quarter of 2012.

Oliver encouraged people to tweet using the hashtag #JeffWeCan, which started trending on Twitter.
