Wales prop Samson Lee was seeing a specialist in London on Monday to gauge the full extent of an Achilles injury.

Lee was carried off just 14 minutes into Wales' 23-16 RBS 6 Nations victory over Ireland at the Millennium Stadium on Saturday.

He will miss next weekend's final Six Nations game against Italy in Rome, where Wales will need to post a sizeable points total to realistically keep alive their title hopes.

Wales assistant coach Robin McBryde confirmed on Monday that Lee is being assessed.

Lee's fellow prop Gethin Jenkins, meanwhile, continues to be reviewed after he went off at half-time against Ireland due to a hamstring problem.

While Rob Evans and Aaron Jarvis are in pole position to line up as props in Rome, Wales have officially called uncapped Exeter prop Tomas Francis into their Six Nations squad.

The prop had to leave the field on a stretcher at the millennium Stadium in Cardiff 

Francis had been training with the squad for the past week, and Saracens loosehead Rhys Gill has been called up to train with the squad, reporting for duty on Monday.

Lock Bradley Davies, meanwhile, has been released back to Wasps after suffering a shoulder injury while with his club.

Wales head coach Warren Gatland is due to name his team for the Italy game on Tuesday.
