Music-sharing site RnBXclusive.com has been shut down by the UK's Serious Organised Crime Agency and a man has been arrested.

The site's home page has been replaced by a message saying, 'If you have downloaded music using this website you may have committed a criminal offence which carries a maximum penalty of up to 10 years imprisonment and an unlimited fine under UK law.'

The site had been used by two million people a month, and was a leading file-sharing destination for R 'n' B and hip hop fans.

The SOCA organised crime agency has replaced RnBXclusive's home page with a warning saying that users could face 10 years in jail. The site was used by two million people per month

The RnBXclusive front page in July 2011, showing links to share music by artists such as Sean Paul. The site is estimated to have cost the music industry £15M a month

The site has been targeted by the organised crime agency because users are said to have stolen pre-release music from record labels to share via the site.

SOCA says that the site's activities cost the music industry £15 million a year.

One individual has been arrested so far. It's not clear whether SOCA will take further action against users of the site.

The warning also automatically tells users details such as their IP address, which can be used to identify their location in a criminal investigation.

Almost 10,000 urban music fans followed it on Twitter, where users expressed shock and concern at the news.

A tweet from ShaRelle said: 'Damn they got RnBExclusive.com (sic) too', while another user, called m., said: 'They have people's IP addresses and everything!'

Sean Paul: RNBXclusive offered his albums for free. The site has now been shut down by the SOCA organised crime agency

SOCA said, 'We can confirm that SOCA has taken action against the www.rnbxclusive.com domain name following a criminal investigation. One individual has been arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud.'

'Much of the music offered for download by thernbxclusive.com website was illegally obtained from artists, leading the industry to attribute losses of approximately £15m per year to the site’s activity.'

'As a result of illegal downloads young, emerging artists may have had their careers damaged. If you have illegally downloaded music you will have damaged the future of the music industry.'

Loz Kaye of UK activist group Pirate Party said, 'The claim that the information gathered can be used to identify visitors, followed by a statement that Soca has the capability to monitor, investigate and inform visitors internet service providers of apparent 'infringements', making visitors liable for prosecution seems extreme and unduly threatening.'

The FBI's recent seizure of 
Megaupload.com and its arrest of founder Kim Dotcom put piracy into the headlines last month.

In
the hour after the bust, total internet trafffic around the world fell 
by two to three per cent - an indication of the scale of Megaupload, 
which hosted 34 per cent of file-sharing, according to analyst Deep 
Field Networks.

But 
just a day afterwards, the trade in shared music and films 'had not 
decreased much', says analyst Deep Field Networks - it had just shifted to new services,
and to new computer servers in Europe, rather than America.

Kim 'Dotcom', MegaUpload's founder was refused bail in New Zealand for running the Megaupload 'digital locker' site.

Accused: Kim Dotcom at his bail hearing on January 25. The judge denied him bail, saying Dotcom's vast wealth meant he could flee the country if released from custody

The
convicted hacker is currently in jail in New Zealand after being 
accused of masterminding a scheme that made more than $175million in a 
few short years by copying and distributing music, movies and other 
copyrighted content without authorisation.

Dotcom
was denied bail last month when Prosecutor Anne Toohey argued at the 
bail hearing that Dotcom, also known as Kim Schmitz, was a flight risk 
'at the extreme end of the scale' because it was believed he had access 
to funds, had multiple identities and had a history of fleeing criminal 
charges.      

In an appeal 
hearing recently Dotcom told the Auckland court he would not flee New 
Zealand and wants to fight to get back his money, some of which 
authorities seized last month.

He
told the court that with his assets frozen and business shut down he 
had no intention of trying to flee to his native Germany, where he would
be safe from extradition.

Flying high: Kim Dotcom enjoyed a super-lavish lifestyle before he was taken into custody

'I will not run away. I want to fight 
these allegations on a level playing field. I have three little 
children. My wife is pregnant with twins. I just want to be with them,' 
he said in court.

At his 
bail hearing last month, his defence lawyer said the former hacker, who 
is reportedly 6ft 6in tall and weighs more than 20 stone (285lbs), was 
hardly likely to escape detection by New Zealand immigration.

'He
is not the sort of person who will pass unnoticed through our customs 
and immigration lines and controls,' said lawyer, Paul Davison.

Kim Dotcom - nicknamed 'Dr Evil' - a German national, was renowned for his flamboyant lifestyle.

He
owned a £3million collection of 25 cars which was confiscated at the 
time of his arrest – mainly top-of-the range Mercedes with number plates
such as ‘STONED’, ‘HACKER’ and ‘GUILTY’ but also including Maseratis, a
vintage pink Cadillac and Dotcom’s runabout, a £300,000 Rolls-Royce 
Phantom with the number plate ‘GOD’.

Although
music stars such as Kanye West and Alicia Keys have supported 
MegaUpload, film and record companies say the seven-year-old 
file-sharing site is making a fortune off their work without paying them
a penny.
