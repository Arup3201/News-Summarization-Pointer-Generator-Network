Internet giant Google is facing a major probe by the privacy watchdog over allegations it is abusing users’ personal data.

The search firm could face fines of hundreds of thousands of pounds if it is found guilty of breaching data protection rules.

Britain’s Information Commissioner was one of six European data protection regulators who launched investigations into the search company yesterday.

Google is facing legal action across Europe as regulators try and force the company to overhaul practices they say let it create a data goldmine at the expense of unwitting users

There are concerns Google’s privacy 
policy is creating a data goldmine at the expense of unwitting users - 
and poses a ‘high risk’ to privacy.

The firm is accused of collecting 
excessive amounts of information on users’ internet activities, keeping 
it for too long and not giving users enough control over how it is used.

The current row revolves around Google's decision to pool of anonymous user data across Google services.

For Google, this is a big advantage when selling online ads.

Google and other large internet 
groups like Facebook provide free services to consumers and earn money 
from selling ads that they say are more closely targeted than 
traditional TV or radio campaign

Privacy campaigners said the firm was 
guilty of ignoring consumers’ rights. But a spokesman for the company 
insisted it was in full compliance with European law.

Nick Pickles, director of privacy 
group Big Brother Watch, said: ‘Google has repeatedly put profit ahead 
of user privacy and the way that the company ignored concerns from 
regulators around the world when it changed its privacy policy showed 
just how little regard it has for the law.

‘Just because Google is a big business
does not put it above the law. The company has ignored the authorities 
and refused to make any meaningful changes to how it collects and uses 
people’s data.

‘Consumers are increasingly concerned 
about how their data is being used and it is essential that those 
breaking the law are properly punished. It is essential regulators find a
sanction that is not just a slap on the wrists and will make Google’s 
think twice before it ignores consumer rights again.’

Google launched a new combined privacy
policy for all its services in March 2012. It allowed the company to 
combine data on individual users from across its services, which include
video-sharing site YouTube, Gmail and social network Google+. Users 
have no right to opt out.

The move prompted a joint privacy 
investigation commissioned by 29 European agencies, including the 
Information Commissioner in the UK.

Successful legal action would hurt Google's image and could block its ability to collect such data until it addresses the regulators' concerns.

Carried out by France’s watchdog, 
CNIL, it concluded in October that the policy posed a ‘high risk’ to the
privacy of individuals.

It found users were not given enough 
information on what data was being collected and used for. Even looking 
at particular websites was automatically recorded and kept for 18 
months.

The company also refused to say how 
long data would be held for. Google was given until February to suggest 
changes, but the firm failed to comply. It was accused of providing 
‘incomplete or approximate’ answers to questions.

Yesterday national investigations were launched in the UK, France, Germany, Spain, Holland and Italy.

It is only the latest privacy scandal 
to hit the company, which is being investigated by the Information 
Commissioner over the collection of huge amounts of data from open Wi-Fi
networks.

Street View cars harvested vast swathes of personal information as they 
took pictures of the country’s streets.

It claimed the collection was a 
‘simply mistake’ but an investigation by US regulators found that a 
company software engineer explicitly designed the Street View programmes
to collect the data and warned his bosses repeatedly about privacy 
implications.

A spokesman for the Information 
Commissioner’s Office said: ‘The ICO has launched an investigation into 
whether Google’s revised March 2012 privacy policy is compliant with the
Data Protection Act.

‘The action follows an initial 
investigation by the French data protection authority CNIL, on behalf of
the Article 29 group of which the ICO is a member. Several data 
protection authorities across Europe are now considering whether the 
policy is compliant with their own national legislation.’

‘As this is an ongoing investigation it would not be appropriate to comment further.’

A Google spokesman said: ‘Our privacy policy respects European law and allows us to create simpler, more effective services.

‘We have engaged fully with the DPAs 
(Data Protection Authorities) involved throughout this process, and 
we’ll continue to do so going forward.’

Google's battle has been running since 2011 - here are the key moments:

March 30, 2011: The Federal Trade Commission announces a settlement with Google. The search and advertising company agrees to adopt a comprehensive privacy program to settle federal charges that it deceived users and violated its own privacy policy when it launched a social-networking service called Buzz.

Jan. 24, 2012: Google announces a plan to link user data across its email, video, social-networking and other services. The company says the move will simplify its privacy policy, improve the user experience and help advertisers find customers more easily, especially on mobile devices. Critics raise privacy concerns. The plan takes effect March 1.

Feb. 28: France's regulator says a preliminary analysis finds that Google's new policy appears to violate European data-protection rules.

April 13: The Federal Communications Commission fines Google $25,000, saying the online search leader "deliberately impeded and delayed" an investigation into how it collected data while taking photos for its Street View mapping feature.

April 26: Google disputes the FCC's characterization of that probe and says the FCC was the party that took its time. Google argues that the 17-month inquiry would have gone much more quickly if the FCC hadn't dawdled so much. Google says it accepted the fine to close the case.

Aug. 9: The FTC announces that Google has agreed to pay a $22.5 million fine to settle allegations that it broke a privacy promise by secretly tracking the online activities of millions of people who use Apple's Safari web browser.

Oct. 16: European regulators ask Google to clarify its new privacy policy and make it easier for users to opt out. 

March 12, 2013: Google says it has agreed to a $7 million fine to settle a probe over Wi-Fi data collection connected to its canvassing for street-level photo. The settlement covers 38 states and the District of Columbia.

April 2: Led by the French, organizations in Britain, the Netherlands, Germany, Spain and Italy agree on legal action against Google over the 2012 changes to its privacy policy.
