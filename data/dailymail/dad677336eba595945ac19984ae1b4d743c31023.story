Feyenoord coach Fred Rutten will leave the club at the end of the season when his one-year contract expires.

The club wanted to extend Rutten's contract, but he says 'my vision differs from the club's about how to meet the high expectations at Feyenoord.'

Rutten took over at Feyenoord this season after his predecessor Ronald Koeman moved to England to coach Southampton.

The Rotterdam team is fourth in the Eredivisie and was knocked out of the Europa League last week by AS Roma. They drew 0-0 against Utrecht at the weekend.

No replacement for Rutten was immediately announced. On Monday, technical director Martin van Geel says 'we now have plenty of time to think about his successor.'

Rutten has not revealed his plans for the future.
