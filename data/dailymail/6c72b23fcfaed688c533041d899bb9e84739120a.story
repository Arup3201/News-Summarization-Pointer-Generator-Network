Robert F. Kennedy's killer Sirhan Sirhan, who is serving a life
sentence in prison for the June 1968 assassination of U.S.
presidential candidate, has been denied parole.

Sirhan, now 70, failed to persuade a
federal judge to set him free because he was innocent of the
crime.

U.S. District Judge Beverly Reid
O'Connell in Los Angeles said on Monday, Sirhan 'failed to meet the showing
required for actual innocence' that might excuse his having
failed to seek his freedom sooner in federal court.

Sirhan had filed his petition for habeas corpus, which could
have resulted in his freedom, in May 2000.

Lawyer for Sirhan, Willaim Pepper, did not immediately
respond on Tuesday to requests for comment.

Sirhan was wrestled to the ground with a gun in his
hand after Kennedy was shot on June 5, 1968, at the Ambassador
Hotel in Los Angeles, shortly after Kennedy won the California
Democratic presidential primary. Kennedy died the next day.

The defendant was sentenced to death in 1969, but his
sentence was commuted to life in prison after California banned
the death penalty. Sirhan was denied parole for a 13th time in
2011. He is now housed in a state prison in San Diego.

In seeking Sirhan's freedom, defense lawyers argued that he
had not been physically in position to fire the fatal shot, and
that a second shooter and gun may have been responsible.

The judge, however, said Sirhan's case was not strong
enough.

'Though petitioner advances a number of theories regardingthe events of June 5, 1968, petitioner does not dispute that hefired eight rounds of gunfire in the kitchen pantry of theAmbassador Hotel,' O'Connell wrote. 'Petitioner does not showthat it is more likely than not that no juror, actingreasonably, would have found him guilty beyond a reasonabledoubt.' 

In rejecting Sirhan's bid for freedom, O'Connell accepted an
August 2013 recommendation by U.S. Magistrate Judge Andrew
Wistrich.

Kennedy was a U.S. senator from New York when he died at age
42. His older brother John F. Kennedy, the former U.S.
president, was 46 when he was assassinated in November 1963.
