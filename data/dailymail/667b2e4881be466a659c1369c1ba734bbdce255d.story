Shaun Wadey was left needing hospital treatment for whiplash after he was thrown from his seat on a ferry which crashed into a harbour wall

An investigation has been launched into how a cross-channel ferry carrying 320 passengers crashed into a harbour wall, hospitalising four people and leaving others injured.

Passengers told of scenes of 'carnage' on board the Dover Seaways ship after it slammed into the dockside during an 8am crossing to Dunkirk yesterday.

Photos taken inside the vessel show passengers lying on the floor amid broken chairs and smashed glass after the accident at the Kent port.

Shaun Wadey, 25, was left needing hospital treatment for severe whiplash after he was thrown from his seat and into a wall.

The sales manager, from Worthing, West Sussex, was supposed to be heading to the French port of Calais with his sister Nikki Brett, 29, and her husband Paul, but they accidentally boarded the wrong ship.

He told MailOnline: 'It was going straight for the harbour wall and we were thinking, he's going to start turning now, he's going to turn, oh c**p, he's not.

'I was sitting at an angle. I tried grabbing hold of the table but I flew two metres and landed on a railing next to a window.

'I then got showered in plates and glasses. I don't remember blacking out but my sister says she thought I was unconscious.

'It was carnage on board, with people lying down on the floor, with smashed plates and drinks glasses around them.

'We drove ourselves to a hospital because there was lots of people needing treatment. There was one pregnant woman with two kids who looked like she was hurt.'

Mr Wadey was given a CT scan and doctors checked him for internal bleeding but he was given the all clear. He suffered whiplash, which he says is very painful.

Four adults were taken to the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford, Kent, as a precautionary measure, although none were believed to have suffered life-threatening or serious injuries. A disabled woman is believed to be among the injured after she was reportedly knocked unconscious in the smash.

Witnesses say they thought the ship was going to turn, but it kept going and crashed into the harbour wall

Joan Tiernan, 51, from Godstone, Surrey was heading away for a short break to the Belgian city of Bruges with her husband Paschal, 53.

Mrs Tiernan said: 'We were at the back of the ferry at the time. We had only just left the dock. It was all fine but we could see the sea was rough outside the harbour.

'My husband thinks there was a change in engine noise but we weren't going very fast. Then after a few seconds there was a huge crash. It was clear we had hit something very large.

'People were thrown around. There were two disabled ladies sitting next to us. Both of them had multiple sclerosis.

'One of the ladies had gone to the loo with a walking frame. She was knocked unconscious after banging her head. We helped her up and stayed with her until the staff came to help her.

'In the restaurant people had been thrown to the floor. It looked like there had been a food fight in there. It was everywhere. The duty free shop looked like it had been ram raided.

'It was sort of shocking at the time but there was no panic. Everyone was quite calm but a lot of people were bemused because there was no announcements and no information given. Staff were just going round telling everyone it was ok.'

Passengers said the shop looked like it has been 'ram-raided', with bottles of spirits and gifts everywhere

Photos from the scene show the damage done to the ship, which was brought back into dock after the incident

Sea conditions in the English Channel were slight to moderate and visibility was good just before the ferry set off on its journey, the Port of Dover said.

The Port, which is carrying out its own investigation, said it was likely that the Marine Accident Investigation Branch would also be looking into the incident which was 'normal procedure'.

A spokesman said the Port and Dover Seaways had immediately put emergency plans into practice to ensure the safety of those on board.

He said: 'Our first priority is always to ensure safety of all those who use the port. Thankfully incidents whilst relatively rare are always professionally and rapidly dealt with.'

He added: 'The vessel, Dover Seaways, is safely berthed in the Eastern Docks. We praise all concerned for their swift response.

'Naturally, the incident will be subject to our own internal investigation and that of the appropriate statutory authorities.'

Photos later tweeted by the Kent 999s Twitter account show the damage done to the ship's bow by the smash.

DFDS said passengers who wished to continue their journey had been accommodated on other DFDS Seaways ferries.

A spokeswoman said the ferry was being assessed for repairs but could not say how bad the damage was or when the ship was expected to sail again.

A Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) spokeswoman said it had been informed of the incident but that it was being dealt with by Dover Port.

She said the MCA was in consultation with a surveyor who would be assessing the damage to the ferry today.
