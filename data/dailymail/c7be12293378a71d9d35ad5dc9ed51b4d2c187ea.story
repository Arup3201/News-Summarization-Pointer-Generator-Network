Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew has challenged Wilfried Zaha to show why Manchester United paid £15 million for the winger when the Eagles travel to Burnley.

Pardew has vowed to raise Zaha's 'profile and spirit' with the 21-year-old on a season-long loan back at first senior club Palace.

Substitute Zaha teed up Jason Puncheon's winner in Palace's 2-1 Premier League victory over Tottenham last weekend, as part of an influential cameo.

New Palace boss Pardew admitted it must be tough going for Zaha to be back for a second loan stint at Selhurst Park since joining United in January 2013.

'I intend to have a word with him,' said Pardew, ahead of Saturday's Premier League trip to Turf Moor.

'He's an important player.

'In terms of finding himself at perhaps the biggest club in the world bar one or two, and not getting an opportunity and having to come back to his former club - I think that's difficult.

'Mentally I think that's difficult for a young player.

'So I feel sorry for him, a little bit.

'And I'll do my best to raise his profile and spirit for us, and for Manchester United because I'm sure they've got one eye on him hopefully still to be a success for them.'

Pardew has guided Crystal Palace to two successive victories since taking over at Selhurst Park this month

Pardew has vowed to hand the entire Palace squad a clean slate as he continues to make his mark after replacing Neil Warnock, who was sacked on December 27.

Forwards Puncheon and Dwight Gayle looked to be heading for a January transfer window exit under Warnock, but both have already impressed since Pardew's arrival.

The former Newcastle manager said he will not allow any outside opinions to influence his team selection.

'If you come in and do well you'll stay in the team,' he said.

'I really could not care less of the value you put at your name, or your stature with the chairman, or your following in the crowd.

'I pick a team I think will win at Burnley, and one that hopefully will beat Everton.

'And everyone gets an even chance.

'But if everyone does the job asked of them, if they are asked to defend or to create and hurt the opposition, and if they do what they've been asked, then they'll stay in the team.

'And all those players are on an even keel with me.'

Palace and Burnley are both locked on 20 points after 21 Premier League games, with Pardew forced to admit the Eagles face a relegation six-pointer this weekend.

'I think it's a very important game for both clubs,' said Pardew.

'I don't like using those terms (six-pointer), but even so it's significant in terms of league position, especially if you manage to win.

'This is a different challenge from Spurs. Burnley are not Spurs and you need to have a team that can cope with that.

'So it's a different test and I'll find out more after Burnley about what we have in the squad.'
