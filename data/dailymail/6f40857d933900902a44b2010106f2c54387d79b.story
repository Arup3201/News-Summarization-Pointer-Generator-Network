Complete with a treetop suspension bridge, a fireman's pole and its own creek, a Queensland treehouse is a dream come true for the inner child of every potential buyer.

Constructed with 26 different types of timber, The Gulch in the Whitsundays' Gregory River incorporates owners Owen and Irene Bailey's love of wood and their rainforest surroundings.

The wooden benchtops seen in the house's uniquely built kitchen were a 'labour of love' and handcrafted by Mr Bailey.

The treehouse property is located on Gleneva Drive in Gregory River in Queensland's Whitsundays and is called The Gulch

A treetop suspension bridge is one of the house's most striking features and is built over the top of a creek that runs through the property

The Gulch has 'slowly evolved' into what it is today over 18 years - when the Baileys first purchased the five-acre parcel of land

Some of the timber that features in The Gulch was sourced from the Whitsundays Islands.

'I collected, stored and milled the timber from my work, knowing one day we would incorporate these special pieces in our home,' he told Ray White Whitsunday real estate agent Michael Barr.

'The kitchen was a labour of love, handcrafting a lot of the benchtops as well as the architraves and the doors.'

The Gulch has 'slowly evolved' into what it is today over 18 years - when the Baileys first purchased the five-acre parcel of land.

The pool inside the house is meant to resemble a lagoon which adds to the tranquil and laidback atmosphere of the treehouse

Imitating the wooden interior, the outdoor entertainment has the master craftmanship seen inside and allows residents to be exposed to the natural surroundings

The house has an open with the living areas running into the kitchen area, with all the eves and architraves handcrafted by owner Owen Bailey

The property sits on five acres of land that Owen Bailey bought in 1994 while he was a treelopper and used to do landscaping

The creek running between the main building and the pool - which has its own timber entertainment deck - is where the treehouse gets its name.

A gulch is a deep valley that has been formed by water erosion.

People can traverse the creek via a suspension bridge which is elevated in the treetops.

To keep with the tranquil atmosphere of the house, the pool was designed to resemble a natural lagoon and has its own undercover seating and kitchen area.

Attached to the outdoor area has a standalone toilet, and the house also has a large workshop area and various man-made dams.

The property is owned by Owen and Irene Bailey who wanted to integrate the house's natural surroudings and Mr Bailey's passion for timber

Most of the house's features were done by Mr Bailey who bought the land 18 years ago when he was 27

Inside, the house has an open floor plan with the living room running into the kitchen and the bedroom.

Irene Bailey told Daily Mail Australia her husband was the one who designed it and oversaw its building.

'Owen was the initiator of the property. He bought the acre in 1994 as a subdivision,' she said.

'He was into timbers, he was a treelopper at the time and used to do landscaping and he was really into the forest and went bushwalking.

'He wanted a property that integrated all of that.

'He just fell in love with the property because it had a deep ravine and he knew it transform in the wet season.'

Ms Bailey said her husband's love of wood was seen throughout the house.

'We have a bed backboard that looks like it has clouds on it,' she said.

'He built it with the idea to draw me in I think, he built it with love, and it worked - we got married in 2002.'

The house was built to the couple's needs, including workspace areas for Owen's timber work and Irene's pottery

Construction for the house started in 2002 and Mr Bailey had help constructing it from a friend who was a registered builder

Ms Bailey said they thought they would never relocate but as a grower of native trees, the property would not allow the couple to expand their nursery business.

'We want someone to really love it and take it to the next level. Really focus it and make it what it needs to be,' she said.

The Gleneva Drive property will go under the hammer on September 29.

Ray White Whitsunday real estate agent Michael Barr said property in the Gregory River area had sold between $400,000 to $800,000, but it was difficult to put a price on a unique house such as The Gulch.

'When I was evaluating the house I brought a catalogue of 100 other properties on the market, but no one house matched it,' he said/

'You can't put a price on the quality of the work and the design.'

A natural watercourse runs through the house, which flows down nearby mountains and is surrounded by valley

Houses in the area have sold for between $400,000 to $800,000 but real estate agent Michael Barr said the house was unique so it was hard to put a price on it

Mr Barr said the most striking feature of the house for him was the suspension bridge over the creek.

'I’ve never seen a suspension bridge in someone’s house before, but for others probably the most striking feature would be the craftsmanship,' he said.

'When you look at the quality of what [Owen's] done it’s pretty special.

'His attention to detail and the way he’s formed the timber and polished it, he’s tried to keep the natural features of the wood.'
