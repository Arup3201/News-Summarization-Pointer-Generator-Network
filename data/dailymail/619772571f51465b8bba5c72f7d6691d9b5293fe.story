It was that time of year, and shoppers were probably expecting to see revellers dressed tastelessly for Halloween.

But the sight of Paul Dutton among the aisles of groceries and toys was beyond a joke.

The 48-year-old, pushing his baby grandson in a trolley, was dressed in full Nazi uniform.

Nazi fanatic Paul Dutton claimed on Twitter it was he who was thrown out of an Asda store in Cambridge after horrified shoppers took offence at his Nazi-SS uniform

Outraged customers complained prompting the manager of the Cambridge 
branch of Asda to ask the Nazi sympathiser, pictured above entering the 
store yesterday, to leave

The Hitler-obsessed father of six was wearing a black SS uniform and cap, with a red armband bearing the swastika, and swastika tattoos on his neck, chest and hand.

While a few shoppers in the Asda store treated it as a sick stunt, others immediately complained to staff, who told Mr Dutton to leave.

An unrepentant Mr Dutton went on Twitter later to say he had been using the Asda branch in the Beehive Centre in Cambridge since it opened three years ago and often wore his uniform.

He said he had intended to hand out cards promoting his website, where he writes about his fascination with Adolf Hitler. Referring to Prince Harry, who had to apologise in 2005 for wearing a Nazi uniform to a fancy dress party as a joke, he added: ‘I got ejected from Asda for wearing something that is good enough for a Prince 2 wear.’

Shopper Rosina Rusin, 60, said: ‘My grandmother’s family died in the gas chambers and I thought “Here is this bloke parading about”. People’s mouths were falling open.

‘You are not going to come out like that unless you want to draw attention to yourself. One lady was very upset – she was close to crying.’

Marisa Baker, 38, said: ‘I saw the tattoo on his neck and a swastika on his hand. It’s not what you want to see, especially as there’s children around.

Police were called at 2pm on Thursday, but Mr Dutton had already left.

Asda said: ‘We had a number of customer complaints so we asked him to leave the store.’

On his website, Mr Dutton says his partner left him after he became fascinated with Nazism and claims that Hitler and Eva Braun faked their deaths and went on to have children in Argentina. He also uses a quote saying that the Holocaust was a ‘necessary evil’.

Last night Mr Dutton insisted that he is not racist.

‘I don’t hate anyone... it’s not about the politics for me,’ he said. ‘I just live and breathe everything Adolf Hitler. Hitler is my whole life, it’s not just a hobby.’

The Waffen-SS, led by Heinrich Himmler, centre, ran concentration camps across eastern Europe where millions of Jews were gassed to death

The SS, Schutzstaffel or protective echelon, was created as an elite corps of the Nazi party.

The black-uniformed members, began their existence as a small personal bodyguard for Hitler.

But the group grew with the success of the Nazi movement to become a virtual state within a state.

Leader
 Heinrich Himmler built up the SS following from around 300 men at its 
formation in 1929 to more than 50,000 by the time the Nazis came to 
power in 1933.

Himmler, a 
racist fanatic, screened applicants for their supposed physical 
perfection and racial purity but recruited from all ranks of German 
society.

The SS gained 
power during the Night of the Long Knives in June 1934 when the Nazi 
regime committed a series of political murders.

Leading members of the left-wing faction of the Nazi party were slayed along with prominent conservative anti-Nazis.

Many of those killed were members of the SA, the paramilitary brownshirts.

Hitler
 used the purge to eliminate critics of his new regime, especially those
 loyal to Vice-Chancellor Franz von Papen, and settle old scores with 
his enemies.

The Night of 
the Long Knives was a turning point in Hitler's leadership, establishing
 him firmly as leader and dictator of the state.

As a result the SS became an independent group answerable to Hitler alone.

Between
 1934 and 1936, Himmler and his second-in-command Reinhard Heydrich, 
consolidated SS strength by gaining control of all of Germany's police 
forces.

By 1939 its numbers totalled around 250,000 men.

It was divided into two groups - the Allgemeine-SS (General SS) and Waffen-SS (Armed SS).

The Waffen-SS was responsible for running the concentration camps, and the mass murder of millions of Jews.

SS men were taught racial hatred and swore absolute loyalty to their Fuhrer, Hitler.Their motto was: 'Thy honour is thy loyalty.'

Following
 the defeat of Nazi Germany by the Allies in 1945, the SS was declared a
 criminal organisation at the Nuremburg trials in 1946.
