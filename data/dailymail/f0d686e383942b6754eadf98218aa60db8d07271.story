Fall: Sales of British block cheeses such as Cheddar, Lancashire and Wensleydale are plummeting

Sales of traditional cheeses such as Cheddar, Lancashire and Wensleydale are plummeting, it has been revealed.

During 2013, sales of Cheddar fell by more than 5 per cent, while demand for other regional varieties was down by 10 per cent or more.

Price rises and increased availability of foreign varieties are thought to behind the drop in sales of British block cheese.

The price of almost all cheese has shot up due to low levels of milk production in the first half of 2013 and increased worldwide demand for dairy products, especially in the Far East.

Regional British cheeses are usually sold
 only in blocks that can cost up to £4, but foreign cheeses such as brie
 and camembert can be a cheaper option because they are sold in smaller 
sizes, perhaps costing about £2.

Industry insiders say tightened household budgets could also be behind the fall in sales of British block cheese.

But sales of lower-fat cheese are also
booming, say analysts Nielsen.

Low-fat sales topped £70million for the 
first time last year as demand went up 5.6 per cent to 9,800 tons.

Some lighter varieties of cheese, such as Cheddar, contain about 22 per cent fat compared with 35 per cent for standard cheddar.

Cheaper: Price rises and increased availability of foreign varieties are thought to behind the drop in sales. Foreign cheeses such as brie (pictured) can also be a cheaper option because they are sold in smaller sizes

Alastair Jackson, marketing manager of cheese maker Adams Foods, said: 'Shoppers are switching from full-fat to reduced-fat cheeses, but trading up half-fat varieties.'

Improved recipes, better taste and more prominence on supermarket shelves are believed to have buoyed the market for lighter cheese.

Most major suppliers of cheddar have 
offered reduced-fat versions for some time time now, such as Cathedral 
City and Anchor - while others are developing lighter varieties of their snacking brands.
