At first glance, these may look like piles of rubbish cluttering up the canals of Venice.

But these are three boats made entirely from salvaged junk - including plywood, motors and bedding.

After six months of gathering materials and shipping them to Slovenia, a team of artists and performers built the boats and set sail to attend the prestigious Venice Biennale art show, even though they hadn't been invited.

Their aim was to show that anything could be built even if you only had the idea.

The Swimming Cities of Serenissima project was the idea of Callie Curry, better known as the Brooklyn-based street artist Swoon.

Street artist Swoon led a team who built three 'floating sculptures' of of junk and sailed them into the prestigious Venice Biennale

The ships of scraps, photographed by Tod Seelie, were built in Slovenia before the crews embarked on the voyage to Venice

After arriving in Venice the group, made of puppeteers, musicians and performers, spent a fortnight entertaining crowds gathered for the Biennale

Each collaborator was picked for their skills, including carpentry, engineering and performance

Brooklyn-based artist Swoon came up with the idea for the Swimming Cities trips, starting with ventures down the Hudson and Mississippi rivers before tackling the trip to Venice

Swoon, whose work is on show at the 
Museum of Modern Art in New York, had previously led teams of friends 
and collaborators down the Hudson and Mississippi Rivers on 'floating 
sculptures' made out of discarded junk, including wood, bedding and car 
parts.

But the project to sail into the 
Venice Biennale show was nearly scuppered by Slovenian 
customs officials who were not sure whether to believe that 40ft 
containers filled with junk were going to be turned into art rather than
dumped on the country's shores.

After getting their containers back, the team of 30 artists, musicians and performers had enough material to build two rafts and planned to make a third out of what they could salvage in Slovenia.

The scavenging began in December 2008, six months before the ships were ready to set sail.

Each crew member was picked for their skills, including carpentry and engineering. Anyone who joined the team had to follow the 'sack of potatoes' rule and bring equivalent food supplies on board.

They turned discarded barrels, scraps found in skips, crates and sheets of plywood into boats which made the 130-mile voyage to Venice, with plenty of stops for scavenging.

The rafts were powered by modified Mercedes car motors that ran on biofuel and had long-tail propellers.

It was all hands on deck for the Swimming Cities crew, who salvaged every piece of the boat

Collaborators on the project included friends of Swoon who were artists and performers

The team collected a 'cabinet of curiosities' on their travels which formed part of their show

They 'docked' for a fortnight of street performances, puppetry and music and showed off a 'cabinet of curiosities' made of objects they found on their journey.

Swoon told Flavorwire that the 'vilest and strangest thing to come aboard has been a dog pelt'.

She said: 'We’ve had kindergartners singing to us, families cooking us dinners that they haul to the docks in ten-gallon buckets, and amazing old ladies bringing lace for our show and fixing our sewing machine.

The Venice trip was almost held up by Slovenian customs officials who weren't convinced at first that the 40ft containers full of junk were going to be turned into art

Everything from car parts to plywood and bedding became part of the boats

The crew's journey from Slovenia to Venice made frequent stops for gathering materials

'This level of human connection and support has never happened in any of my other artistic projects, and it is so touching.'

On their Tumblr site, the team said: 'To the real life crew, the boats were a place of refuge – both a home and a way of moving through the world.

'To those who encounter the boats for the first time, they were a reminder that anything that can be imagined can be built.'

Every person on board helped with ship life, whether steering or feeding the crew

The boats were sturdy enough for crew members to set up a swing
