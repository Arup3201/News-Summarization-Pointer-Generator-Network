A man has been charged with punching a cashier at a betting shop - after allegedly losing two bets worth only £1.20 in total.

John Damien Eamer, 29, of Cromwell Street, Gloucester, is charged with assault by beating.

He was charged after police issued CCTV images of the alleged attack, which happened in a Ladbrokes betting shop in Gloucester.

CCTV images appeared to show an angry punter punching a woman cashier at a Ladbrokes branch in Gloucester

The alleged attack happened in a branch of Ladbrokes, on Southgate Street in Gloucester, at 10.10am on Sunday

Eamer is due to appear before Cheltenham Magistrates' Court on July 6.

A female cashier was left with bruising underneath her eye after the incident on Sunday.

CCTV footage appeared to show an angry punter punching a cashier twice in the face.

Gamblers watched as the man, wearing a green T-shirt, appeared to lean over the counter and hit the woman as she went about her work.

Images then appeared to show the man walking casually out of the shop.

After the incident, a spokesman for Ladbrokes said security screens to protect staff were in place in some 
shops.

He said: 'If they don't (have screens) it's usually a sign that 
the shop is generally quite safe and has few security incidents.'

Ladbrokes confirmed that the man involved stood to win just £1.20 from his bet.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
