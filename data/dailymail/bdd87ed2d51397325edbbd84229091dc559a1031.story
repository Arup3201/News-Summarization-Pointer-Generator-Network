Once a fertile wetland, this scarred corner of Ghana is now dominated by black plumes of smoke and the acrid smell of burning plastic after becoming the world's largest e-waste dumping ground, littered with unwanted televisions and electronic devices from across the globe.

While most people would expect their electrical goods to be recycled properly, the toxic chemicals inside can make it expensive to do so, making illegal dumping a lucrative business.

Traders from across Europe, the U.S., China and India have therefore reportedly been sending containers of 'Development Aid' or 'Second-Hand Products' to Tema Harbour, the contents of which end up being dumped 20 miles east in Agbogbloshie.

Dumping ground: Ogbogbloshie has become the world's largest e-waste dumping ground. Pictured is Adam Nasara, 25, using polystyrene to light a fire

Health problems: The eyes of John Mahama, 21, are twitching, he suffers from insomnia and has debilitating headaches, but continues to work

Waste: Old monitors are used to build bridges across the water. Traders from across the world have reportedly illegally dumped goods at the site

Playground: Agbogbloshie is a playground for Kwabena Labobe, 10. His parents are not able to send him to school and forbid him to burn e-waste

Making a living: Baba Salifu, 15, burns e-waste and breeds goats in Agbogbloshie. While some of the boys are aware of the health risks posed by working at the site, many are not put off

Photographer Kevin McElvaney has now documented how boys and young men make their living by salvaging metals and burning cables to get to the copper inside.

Such dangerous work among toxic chemicals however leads to a range of injuries including lung problems, untreated wounds, headaches and insomnia.

The Hamburg-based photographer said most of the boys die from cancer in their 20s, but even being aware of the dangers is not enough to put many of them off carrying on working at the site.

He said the old lagoon is filled with computers, monitors, Hi-Fi systems, videoplayers and a range of other devices, as a result of illegal exportation and fake donations labelled as 'development aid'.

He said while some of the boys are now careful about the risks of working at the site, others continue to remain unaware of the dangers, while some just no longer care.

He said one of the young men had arrived at Agbogbloshie from the Ivory Coast a few days earlier to start his 'career' searching for tins between the food waste.

Once fertile land: Mr McElvaney said cows still visit their old grazing grounds but are now poisoned by the e-waste

Occupation: Adam Latif, 21 cycles around the dumping ground and brings lucrative tools to his friends, who burn the e-waste

Water: Adjoa, nine, sells small water bags to the boys. They drink it and also use it to extinguish fires

Work: Munu Tali,14, also sells small water bags, often sold by girls in groups. In the background is a shack where youngsters dismantle the e-waste in groups and protect themselves from the sun

Escape: Mohammed Camara, 20, left the Ivory Coast because his family were killed in civil war. Agbogbloshie is his escape

Metal collector: Some of the young men, such as Alhassan Adams, 19, say they will never burn e-waste and focus their work on collecting tins. They are still at risk of malaria because of the amount of mosquitos present

Writing on his website, Mr McElvaney said: 'I wondered why he was satisfied with this situation but then he told me, that because of civil war struggles in his homeland he lost his mum, dad and brother and decided to stay rather here, than to fight and maybe die there.'

Mr McElvaney goes on to write that while he felt sorry for the people who lived in Agbogbloshie, he felt it was wrong to be sad while the children played and spoke of their future plans.

He writes: 'Most boys work together as a group and help each other like a family. Many of them try to forget the sad parts in their story and focus on their opportunities, which was wonderful to hear, but I had some facts in the back of my mind.

'Most of them will die from cancer in their 20s and grow up without education.

Worker: Rahman Dauda, 12, started working here three years ago and burns e-waste with a few friends. 'Whenever possible I go to school,' he says

For sale: Computers that look like they are in good shape are sold untested to customers in Accra and elsewhere

Littered: Mohammed Amin, 20, has been burning e-waste at the site for the last two years

Fruit sellers: Women from a nearby market sell fruit to the boys and scrap dealers

Friends: Pieter Adongo, 17, shows a Polaroid of himself and his friends, Desmond Atanga, 17, and Sampson Kwabena, 16

Collecting metal: Desmond Atanga, 17, uses magnets from old speakers to collect metal on the site

'Chief': Ibrahim Abdulai, 23, is a 'chief'. Nobody is working for him, but he is able to decide who is allowed to burn and who does not in this particular area

'At the point where they have enough money, they often get sick and have to spend it on medicine, sleeping pills and food.

'To earn money, they can just start the same work again and again, but in the end they are not able to leave this place and start their dream.

'So this work seems wrong, but till today there is no alternative in this region. Burning cables and electronic-waste became a livelihood for many people there and it is expected that the e-waste exports to Ghana will be doubled till 2020.'
