New York cops gave two teens jaywalking tickets as they were being treated in an emergency room, suffering multiple injuries, after being struck by a vehicle in Brooklyn. 

Beanca Moise and Jo-Anna Thiboutot, both 16, were rushed to the Kings County Hospital Center on March 14 suffering multiple fractures and bruises after being struck by a car as they attempted to cross the street mid-block in a section of Flatbush Avenue, according to the New York Post. 

Moise said she thought the cops standing near her hospital bed, as doctors swarmed around her, were there to see if she was okay.

Instead, they were there to give her and Thiboutot tickets for jaywalking -- illegally or recklessly crossing the street without regard for approaching traffic.

'It was very insulting,' Moise told the Post. 'I got hit by a car, and they came to the hospital not even checking if I was okay, and just gave us the ticket.'

The cops told the Post that they were simply following Mayor Bill de Blasio's Vision Zero orders - an effort to end traffic deaths and injuries by cracking down on reckless drivers and pedestrians.

They told the teens' parents that the tickets were mandatory given the mayor's 'zero tolerance' jaywalking policy.

Thiboutot's mother, Rose Benjamin, was handed the teen's summons as her daughter was being treated for deep bruises and gashes on a hospital stretcher. 

The accident reports and the girls' summonses blame the teens for running into traffic because the girls were attempting to cross the street mid-block, the Post reports.

Each summons was signed by one 63rd Precinct cop, a 'PO Nagle.'

The driver, Edwin Lawrence, did not receive a summons because a witness reportedly told police Lawrence had the right of way.

Jaywalking summonses have risen to 2,000 a year since the mayor implemented the crackdown, according to the Post.

'Crackdown:' Wiley Norvell, a spokesperson for City Hall, took to Twitter Saturday saying that five tickets a day in a city of millions is hardly a 'jaywalking crackdown'

The girls' families plan to fight the summons and sue the driver. They hired lawyer Michael Goldberg who questioned why the officers had to hand-deliver the tickets to the girls while they were being treated at the hospital, the Post reports.

Weeks after the incident, Moise remains on crutches and reportedly needs two more months to recover from fractures and bone contusions.

Though the officer's held that they were simply following orders in delivering the 'mandatory' tickets, Wiley Norvell, a spokesman for City Hall, told Gothamist that there is 'no such thing as a 'zero tolerance' policy on jaywalking.'

'Enforcement decisions are made precinct by precinct as commanding officers see fit, based on conditions they see on the ground,' he said. 

Serious Injuries: In 2014, an elderly man, Kang Wong, suffered serious head injures as NYPD cops attempted to arrest him after stopping the man for jaywalking in the city's Upper West Side

Norvell stated that five jaywalking tickets are issued each day adding that 100 are given for failure to yield. Norvell took to Twitter Saturday saying that five tickets a day in a city of millions is hardly a 'jaywalking crackdown.'

The city saw an increase in jaywalking tickets shortly after the mayor implemented the Vision Zero plan in 2014.

With Police Commissioner Bill Bratton embracing the mayor's plan, the New York Police Department issued more than 400 jaywalking tickets in the first two months of 2014 -- compared with just 50 the year before, the Post reports.

The jaywalking 'crackdown' provided tickets to many New Yorkers last year, Meanwhile de Blasio and his security detail were caught on video jaywalking.
