A three-year-old boy has shot and injured his heavily pregnant mother and his father after reaching into his mother's purse for her iPod and discovering a loaded handgun, police have said.

The toddler was sitting in a motel room in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with his mother, Monique Villescas, father, Justin Reynolds, and two-year-old sister on Saturday when the shooting occurred.

He reportedly reached into Miss Villescas's purse in a bid to reach her iPod, but unwittingly pulled out a gun instead. Seconds later, he fired one shot, striking his father in the right buttock.

The bullet then traveled out of Mr Reynolds's hip and struck his long-term girlfriend - who is eight months' pregnant - in the arm, police said. The pair were rushed to hospital with gunshot wounds.

Mr Reynolds has since been released. Miss Villescas's condition remains unknown. However, police said the expectant mother appeared to have been 'seriously' injured in the shooting. 

In the minutes leading up to the incident, the boy's parents were preparing to order pizza in the room at America's Best Value Inn, near Menaul and University, where the family has been living.

Police arrived after the scene shortly after 2pm after Mr Reynolds called 911. They found the parents suffering from injuries, while a 9mm handgun was located on the floor of the motel room.

Speaking of the incident on Saturday evening Mr Reynolds said: 'It was like if I was to get up shake your hand and sat back down. That's how fast it happened. All of a sudden we heard a gun go off.

'The next minute I realized my girlfriend was bleeding. Then I sat down and realized I was shot too. I was more worried about my girlfriend than myself and anything else that was going on.

'And my son because I didn't know if he had shot himself or not. He was shocked and crying.'

Although Miss Villescas and Mr Reynolds have confirmed the story, the boy and his sister will not be interviewed until a later date, according to the Albuquerque Journal.

Albuquerque Police Department officer Simon Drobik told the newspaper police will likely recommend that the parents are charged with felony criminal negligence over the incident.

'The child did the damage, but it was because of the negligence of the adults that the child was able to do this,' he said. 'If you are going to be a gun owner, you need to lock it up and keep it safe.'

The toddler and his younger sister are currently in state custody, KOB 4 reported.
