Samir Nasri's summer of fun with girlfriend Anara Atanes is coming to an end, as the start of the Premier League season draws closer and closer.

Fresh from flying back into the country from Los Angeles on Tuesday, the couple posted an Instagram pic of the two of them fresh from a workout session at the gym. Pre-season training has well and truly begun.

The 27-year-old playmaker was left out of Didier Deschamps' France squad and it should be City that reap the rewards with Nasri at his freshest ahead of what is likely to be another tough campaign battling on four fronts at home and in Europe.

The midfielder's girlfriend posted a number of pictures of the pair while they were on holiday, and has continued the trend with this post from back home.

Manuel Pellegrini will surely be delighted at the prospect of having one of last season's City stars getting himself back into top shape after a strenuous summer for most of his squad out in Brazil.

Nasri is expected to return to training on Monday alongside City's other holidaying stars including Stevan Jovetic and Alvaro Negredo.
