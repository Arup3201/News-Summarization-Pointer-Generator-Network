Fed up with being cast in 'funny and fat' roles overweight Jamie Tuthill shed a whopping eight stone in a bid to play the romantic lead.

The budding actor, 25, from Fressingfield, Suffolk, felt that he was always typecast as the fat king in his local Christmas panto.

Weighing 21-stone at his heaviest, Mr Tuthill took up Zumba and joined his local Weight Watchers reducing his size to a slim 13 stone.

Transformation: Jamie Tuthill before and after he lost eight stone. He now hopes to land a romantic leading role

The panto performer had been overweight since childhood, and lived up to the part for most of his life.

He started to see the error of his ways when he struggled to squeeze into an XXL costume for his second stint as the king in Cinderella.

But it was only when a video of the panto was played at his local pub and he saw how big he looked that Mr Tuthill decided to take action.

He said: 'I knew I was big but I never realised just how big until that moment.

Mr Tuthill took up Zumba and joined his local Weight Watchers group after seeing a video of himself performing in panto

'I saw myself and was horrified, it seemed like it was on such a big screen.

'Because I was jolly and quite confident people didn't tell me how large I was getting.

'You know when someone asks you to name the fat kid at school? I was that kid, and I didn't want to be big anymore, I'd been big my whole life.

'When I got the role as the fat King for the second time I suddenly stopped and thought, have I been typecast here? I don't think I'd have ever got any other role other than the funny fat guy.

After his dramatic weight loss Mr Tuthill hopes to be cast as a romantic prince in a future panto production

'I never went for bigger roles as I was worried I wouldn't fit into the outfits.'

Mr Tuthill started Zumba classes and joined his local Weight Watchers group, he now weighs just 13 stones.

He said: 'I used to love doing am dram because it gave me a chance to be anyone but me.

'Now I would like to do it for the right reasons.

Jamie Tuthill used to eat half a loaf of bread a day, but now he only eats bread once a week

'Perhaps this time around I could get the role of the prince.

'I would love to be the hero who has women falling in love with him, something that was out of the question before.'

Mr Tuthill piled on the pounds eating half a loaf of bread a day as well as snacking on crisps and chocolate.

He now only eats bread once a week, and snacks on healthy fruit and vegetables.
