U.S. First Lady Michelle Obama kept up her charm offensive in China by visiting the site of the terracotta warriors – but briefly talked about politics calling on the Chinese government to open up the internet to all of its citizens.

The First Lady, along with daughters Sasha 12, and Malia 15, watched a folk dance by local performers during her visit to the City Wall, in Xi'an, Shaanxi province and later joined in by dancing and skipping rope, much to the delight of her Chinese hosts.

The family also came face-to-face with China’s terracotta warriors on Monday on a week-long tour of several major sites while the First Lady carefully skirted political issues.

Mrs Obama and her daughters stood in one of the largest 
pits at the site of the Teracotta army which is located outside Xian, in
 the northern province of Shaanxi to view the stunning ancient statues 
while a guide showed them around.

The
 site houses 8,000 life-size warriors left by China's first emperor Qin 
Shi Huang who reigned in the 3rd century BC, a hugely popular tourist 
attraction that saw five million visitors last year.

Since her arrival in Beijing on Thursday night Mrs Obama has focused on talking about soft issues.

Educating: The First Lady posed with schoolchildren during the trip. She is officially in China to help promote education and has widely steered clear of controversial issues

Grandma diplomacy: Mrs Obama has brought her mother Marian Robinson (far right) along on the trip as part of a nod to traditional family values

Audience: The family watch the performance from the top of an ancient city wall

She promoted education and study abroad whilst on a
 tour of the Forbidden City, a former imperial palace, with her 
counterpart Peng Liyuan and avoided speaking about human rights or 
freedom of speech.

But at her first and only speech on Saturday at Peking University's Stanford Centre she argued for greater internet freedoms.

Mrs
 Obama said that new technology can ‘open up the entire world and expose
 us to ideas and innovations we could never have imagined.’

She
 added: ‘When it comes to expressing yourself freely, and worshipping as
 you choose, and having open access to information -- we believe those 
are universal rights that are the birthright of every person on this 
planet.’

‘We believe 
that all people deserve the opportunity to fulfill their highest 
potential, as I was able to do in the United States’

The First Lady’s speech was at China’s oldest national university in northwestern Beijing.

Fashion forward: Mrs Obama looked to have co-ordinated her wardrobe with that of her eldest daughter with both she and Malia sporting black skinny trousers and wearing their hair in loose curls

Speaking to a mixture of 200 Chinese and American students, Mrs Obama spent much of her speech promoting the values of study-abroad programs.

However, she was also keen to praise the power of the internet for its ability to spread freedom.

She did not mention issues about censorship or the fact that the Chinese government blocks social-media sites like Twitter and Facebook.

China has developed its own brand of social media sites like Weibo or Weixin which are extremely popular, in the absence of any other social media platforms.

Mrs Obama also warned that a government should not shield itself from criticism.

She said: ‘That’s how we decide which values and ideas we think are best—by questioning and debating them vigorously, by listening to all sides of the argument and by judging for ourselves.’

Lesson: The family were told of the history of the The Terracotta Army or the 'Terracotta Warriors and Horses', a collection of terracotta sculptures depicting the armies of Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China

Up close: The family and their tour guides get up close to the world famous statues as their tour guide shows them around the historic site

Educational visit: Mrs Obama, her mother and her two young daughters looked relaxed and were dressed casually as they made their way around the ancient models

‘And believe me, I know how this can be a messy and frustrating process. My husband and I are on the receiving end of plenty of questioning and criticism from our media and our fellow citizens, and it’s not always easy but we wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world.’

‘Because time and time again, we have seen that countries are stronger and more prosperous when the voices and opinions of all citizens can be heard,’ she said.

While Ms Obama’s trip has been largely successful, on Sunday, her motorcade was met with jeers from two people outside the U.S. embassy in Beijing. Police and men in grey sweatshirts hurried to subdue the protestors, and it was unclear why they were shouting.

In addition to her trips to see the Terracotta army, Mrs Obama and her daughters strolled along the Great Wall of China to the north of the capital to view another breathtaking Chinese monument.

Vendors at the tourist site appeared to have removed T-shirts that are typically on sale showing President Obama in a Mao hat, with one merchant revealing a boxful of the souvenirs stored in the back of her tent.

The Terracotta Army or the 'Terracotta Warriors and Horses', is a collection of terracotta sculptures depicting the armies of Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. It is a form of funerary art buried with the emperor in 210–209 BC and whose purpose was to protect the emperor in his afterlife.

The figures, dating from around the late third century BC, were discovered in 1974 by local farmers in Lintong District, Xi'an, Shaanxi province. The figures vary in height according to their roles, with the tallest being the generals.

The figures include warriors, chariots and horses.

Three pits containing the Terracotta Army hold over 8,000 soldiers, 130 chariots with 520 horses and 150 cavalry horses, the majority of which are still buried in the pits chariots with 520 horses and 150 cavalry horses, the majority of which are still buried in the pits near by Qin Shi Huang's mausoleum. Other terracotta non-military figures were also found in other pits and they include officials, acrobats, strongmen and musicians.

The Terracotta Army was discovered on 29 March 1974 to the east of Xi’An in Shaanxi province by a group of farmers when they were digging a water well around one mile east of the Qin Emperor's tomb mound at Mount li (Lishan)a region riddled with underground springs and watercourses.

For centuries, there had been occasional reports of pieces of terracotta figures and fragments of the Qin necropolis– roofing tiles, bricks, and chunks of masonry – having been dug up in the area.
