Erik Lamela insists Thursday's Europa League clash against Fiorentina is more important than Sunday's Capital One Cup final.

Tottenham go into the clash against the Serie A side needing to score after a 1-1 draw at White Hart Lane.

The clash comes just three days before the League Cup final against Chelsea.

But Lamela insists the clash in Florence is more important than Sunday's Wembley showpiece.

'That game is not as important as this one because that's a different game.

'Which one would I rather win? Both. We’re confident we can play and it’s very important because we need to win.

'There is a big game but first we have to concentrate on winning tomorrow.'

Lamela added that Tottenham are confident of reaching the last 16 of the Europa League ahead of the second leg encounter and they are expecting an attacking game.

'Fiorentina are a good team, they will play the same style as always and it will be an open game. 

We hope it’s a good game. Each team will go for it and try to win. The game is open for both our teams.' 

The Argentina international refuted claims that tiredness could be a problem for Mauricio Pochettino's side ahead of the cup final game with Chelsea, saying that the size of Tottenham's squad allows players to get enough recovery time.

'We are improving, of course at times it’s difficult because we feel tired  but we have plenty of players and that helps us a lot,' Lamela explained.

'Maybe you get tired at times but we have a squad with many players and everyone can play his part. We can do well, we have skills in the team to do well.'
