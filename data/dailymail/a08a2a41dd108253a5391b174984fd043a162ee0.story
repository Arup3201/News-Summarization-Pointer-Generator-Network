On a glorious summer’s day what middle-aged man hasn’t imagined himself with the wind in his hair, at the wheel of an open-top sports car?

Alas, the majority have to content themselves with a trudge behind the family lawn mower. 

But Mike Clark doesn’t just dream — and he isn’t content with the limitations of terra firma.

The sky is the limit: Mike Clark in the cockpit of his Fokker Eindecker replica plane on in Horsham, West Sussex

If the sun is shining and the wind in the right direction, Mr Clark is likely to be taxiing out of his garage and taking off from his rural back garden cum runway at the controls of a World War I fighter plane.

For £12,000 — less than the cost of a small second-hand roadster — the 62-year-old has built a replica of the celebrated Fokker Eindecker E.III.

This elegant German machine — the first specifically designed single-seat fighter aircraft in aviation history — was much feared by the pilots of the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service, over the skies of France and Belgium. Indeed, between July 1915 and early 1916, it became known as the ‘Fokker Scourge’.

Our pilots were mere ‘Fokker Fodder’ and they fell in their scores.

The Fokker is in the microlight category and is therefore not subject to the same airworthiness regulations as a regular aircraft

Despite his own mount’s (replica) machine-gun Mr Clark, who is a commercial airline pilot, has no such murderous intent. 

Instead, he enjoys tootling over the rolling countryside around his home near Horsham, West Sussex, at a cruising speed of 55mph, thanks to his 50-horsepower Hirth motor, which runs off the same fuel as his car, mixed with two-stroke oil.

As it weighs just 115 kilos when empty, the Fokker is in the microlight category and is therefore not subject to the same airworthiness regulations as a regular aircraft. 

It took 18 months to build using a kit bought from Grass Strip Aviation, a company based in Stroud.

Since its completion in June 2012, Mr Clark has notched up 90 hours¿ flying time. It has a range of 90 miles on a 20-litre tank of fuel

Since its completion in June 2012, Mr Clark has notched up 90 hours’ flying time. It has a range of 90 miles on a 20-litre tank of fuel, with a sedentary stall speed of 25mph.

Mr Clark denies that it is merely a busman’s holiday. ‘It’s still flying, but it’s very different from airline flying,’ he says. 

‘It’s the freedom, in some ways it’s more challenging. In the airline world, everything is done by numbers, it all comes out of a book, whereas you rely much more on experience and judgment when you’re flying from a grass strip. 

‘The grass is a bit longer, it’s wet, the wind’s not quite right — it’s all down to judgment. The Eindecker is very exposed. 

‘Because it is very light it does pick up the (wind) turbulence very well, so you have to choose your time for flying it — normally morning or evening, when it’s a bit calmer.’

Such great heights: So far Mr Clark has flown up to 3,000ft but says he would be a bit scared to go any higher than that

Support: As with most middle-aged male hobbies, it helps if your partner approves ¿ particularly if your lawn is being used for take-off and landings

Mr Clarke said flying a passenger jet is much different - in the Eindecker he said you have to rely much more on experience and judgement

So far, Mr Clark has flown up to 3,000ft. ‘I’d be a bit scared to go any higher than that,’ he admits. ‘In any case, it gets rather cold up there. You have to wrap up well.’

As with most middle-aged male hobbies, it helps if your partner approves — particularly if your lawn is being used for take-off and landings.

Mr Clark’s wife, Esther, is a 54-year-old teacher and textile artist. 

She is also Dutch, like the Eindecker’s designer, Anthony Fokker. Perhaps that is why she has been ‘very supportive’ of this home aviation project, the latest of several.

‘The only thing she doesn’t like about it is that it’s a two-stroke engine and the exhaust does tend to make rather a smell,’ explains Mr Clark. ‘So she keeps well away when I go flying.’

Mrs Clark says: ‘I’m not too worried about him flying, I worry more when he has a  long drive. I think driving on motorways or country lanes is more dangerous. It makes him happy, and I suppose it’s better than him lingering in bars.’
