An ‘arresting and dark’ painting by Francis Bacon was sold at auction yesterday for nearly £18million.

Study For A Portrait, produced in 1953, was bought by an anonymous telephone bidder when it went under the hammer at Christie’s in London.

The artwork had been expected to fetch somewhere in the region of £11million but went on to reach an astonishing £17,961,250.

Valuable: Francis Bacon's Study for a Portrait was sold to an anonymous bidder for £7m more than its asking price during yesterday's auction

It is the second most valuable piece to be sold at a post-War and contemporary art sale at the auction house, a spokesman said.

The highest selling work in this category was another piece by Bacon, Triptych, which went for £26.3million in February 2008.

Study for a Portrait, a moody oil on canvas which measures 2m by 1.4m, is described as ‘an arresting and dark study in the degradation of power’.

It was previously owned by two of Francis Bacon’s contemporaries – Rodrigo Moynihan, a pioneer of abstract painting in the 1930s, and Louis le Brocquy, one of Ireland’s most important painters of the 20th century.

Never previously sold at auction, the artwork has always been in private hands and was acquired by the present owner in 1984.

Meanwhile, Woman Smiling, 1958-59, a portrait by Lucian Freud, sold for £4,745,250.

Sold: Andy Warhol's portrait of Chairman Mao went for a price of £6,985,250 at the auction

The only single portrait of Suzy Boyt, the mother of four of the 
artist’s children, it last went under the hammer in 1973 for £5,040.

Seven works from the collection of Kay Saatchi went for a total of 
£3,992,750 while a large scale portrait of Chairman Mao by Andy Warhol 
came in at £6,985,250.

The sale of 67 works is expected to make up to £77,620,000.
