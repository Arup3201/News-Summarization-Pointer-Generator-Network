Sitting on the pavement next to his dog and sleeping bag, Simon Wright looked to all the world like a homeless beggar.

But what the passers-by who gave him cash didn’t know was that he was earning over £50,000 a year and living in a £300,000 council flat in west London.

At the end of every day he would pick up his handwritten sign and head back to his Fulham home.Locals say he regularly went into bookmakers and amusement shops to change up his loose coins.

On many occasions they added up to 
between £200 and £300. Magistrates have now imposed a two-year Asbo 
banning him from begging anywhere in London.

PC Oliver Strebel, who brought the 
case to court, said: ‘He had a reputation for getting a lot of gifts 
while begging.

'He used a sign saying he was homeless and people gave him
 money on that basis, which is clearly fraud. He would take the money 
from his cup and change it over at a local betting shop or amusement 
arcade.

‘He worked pretty much every day, and had done so for about three years. He certainly put in the hours.’

Wright proved Putney High Street in 
south-west London was such a lucrative venue that he attracted up to 
nine other beggars. Since his arrest, they have all but disappeared.

Wright
 would sit wearing ragged clothes outside NatWest bank in Putney High 
Street, near Putney station, with his dog and ask the public for money.

But after a hard day’s begging Wright 
would pack up his sleeping bag and, instead of heading to a shelter, he 
would make his way across Putney Bridge to his comfortable flat in Simms
 Court, Fulham High Street.

Commuters who fell for his bad luck story said they were shocked to learn Wright had duped them.

Chris Faversham, from Putney, said: 'I
 definitely gave him money over the years. Probably about £20. I wonder 
if I can get that back?'

In December 2012 suspicious residents were suggesting that something was not quite right about Wright’s predicament.

Some said he changed up his donations 
in Greggs in Putney High Street while others said he lived in a tent on 
Putney Embankment.

But Wright’s days of fleecing the 
public are over after magistrates slapped an Asbo on him banning him 
from visiting the SW15 area (Roehampton and Putney) and from begging 
anywhere in the capital.

Wimbledon Magistrates' Court, sitting 
on May 14, also ordered him to keep his dog muzzled and under control at
 all times in a public place after magistrates were told it had bitten 
at least one person.

The Asbo will remain in place until 
May 2015 but if Wright, who admitted fraud and begging, breaches any of 
its terms he could be sent to prison for up to five years and face an 
unlimited fine.

The council’s community safety 
spokesman Cllr Jonathan Cook said: 'Anyone who lives, works or shops in 
and around Putney High Street will be mightily relieved to see this 
unpleasant individual given his marching orders.

'He deliberately targeted people 
making cash withdrawals from this cashpoint and was extremely aggressive
 and abusive to anyone who refused to give him money.

'Many people felt frightened and 
intimidated by him and there is some evidence to suggest that he used 
his dog to threaten and pressure people into handing over their cash.

'His behaviour was an absolute 
disgrace. The fact that he was actually living in a comfortable flat in 
Fulham, something that many of his victims can only dream of, just adds 
insult to injury.

'Everyone who has been appalled by Mr 
Wright’s behaviour will I’m sure wish to congratulate the Thamesfield 
Safer Neighbourhoods Team, especially PC Oliver Strebel, who was the 
officer in the case and also the Crown Prosecution Service whose lawyers
 worked so closely with the police to bring about this very positive 
result for Putney.'
