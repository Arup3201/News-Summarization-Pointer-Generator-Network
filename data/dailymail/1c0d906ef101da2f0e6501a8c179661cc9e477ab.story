A freediver managed to catch a 12lb lobster that he reckons could be as old as 70.

Forrest Galante, 26, a biologist, was diving near Anacapa Island off the Californian coast when he found the huge Pacific Spiny lobster lurking on the sea bed.

A specimen of this size would have been common decades ago. But now, as a result of overfishing, the crustaceans rarely weigh in at more 3lbs.

Mr Galante faced a dilemma over whether or not to eat the lobster, who he named Albert Girther because of his impressive size, but in the end he decided to let him live.

Mr Galante caught the lobster on October 6. He said: 'I've been doing this for ten years and I've never seen a lobster as big as Albert Girther - which is his name.

'I mean any lobster that can bear hug a man must be pretty huge and he had no problem with that.

'Originally I thought he was the world's biggest lobster but I was just excited - I'm pretty sure he is the biggest lobster caught off the west coast this year though.

'They normally only manage to grow to around three pounds because of intensive fishing so it's really rare to find one this old and big.

'I won an award from my free diving club last year for bringing in a 9.4lb lobster, so Albert has definitely surpassed that.'

Deeeelicious: But Mr Galante resisted the urge to eat Albert and instead let him go in a marine reserve

Pacific spiny lobsters are nocturnal and Mr Galante was on a night dive when he found Albert. Pictures show the disconcertingly large crustacean gripping onto to Mr Galante with its long legs.

Spiny lobsters are distinct from the more-recognisable clawed lobsters, not having the mammoth pincers on their front legs that make the latter so apparently fearsome. Because they lose all their hard parts each time they moult it is not possible to accurately age them, so biologists make guesses based on the lobsters' size and weight.

Mr Galante took Albert home to his family in Santa Barbara, California, where he introduced his meaty new friend to the dog.

'I've got to say it was very tempting to take him home and eat him - he had pounds and pounds of delicious meat but he was clearly a good breeder, so my family and I decided that we had to put him back into the water so he could have more children,' Mr Galante said.

'We took him to the Ty Warner Sea Centre where he was put in a tank and gorged on food but we were not going to leave him in captivity.

'We put him back into the water in a marine reserve off the coast of California which does not allow fishing, so he can live out the rest of his days in peace.'

Nowadays overfishing means Albert's peers rarely reach more than 3lbs
