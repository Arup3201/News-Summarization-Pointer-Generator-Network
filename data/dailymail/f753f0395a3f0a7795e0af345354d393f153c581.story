Quite a few 30-somethings have wished they could turn back the clock and be a teenager again.

Sarah Thomson experienced the reality when a burst artery in her brain wiped out her memories of marriage and 13 years of motherhood.

The 32-year-old went into a coma from which she awoke thinking she was 19.

The way we live now: Sarah Thomson after her operation, left, and as she thought she still was, right

Family album: Ms Thomson had no memory to of her wedding to husband Chris or of her children Michael, 14, Daniel, five and four-year-old Amy

She had no idea who husband Chris and 
children Michael, 14, Daniel, five, and four-year-old Amy were. She 
started to dye her hair all colours and, by her confession, act moodily 
like a teenager.

The ten days she spent in intensive 
care last November had destroyed 13 years of her life, making her think 
it was still 1998. Mrs Thomson thought her favourite band the Spice 
Girls were together, had no memory of the Millennium and didn't know 
Michael Jackson had died.

'When the children came to see me I 
just had no idea who they were, I thought they were somebody else's,' 
said Mrs Thomson, who lives in Exeter. 'I kept calling them the wrong 
names, and had no idea why they were so pleased to see me.

Who am I? Ms Thomson, pictured left with husband Chris and right after her operation to remove a blood clot on her brain, said she still feels like a teenager

'When the rest of my family came to 
see me I took one look at my brother and said “You're bald”. I told my 
parents how rough they looked too – it was like they'd aged overnight.'

For some time she thought her husband was a hospital worker.

'When I realised I'd be going home 
with him I was really confused – I thought I was still with my ex,' she 
said. 'Luckily my mum explained who he was, but I had no recollection of
meeting him.'

Pieces of the puzzle: Ms Thomson, pictured with husband Chris and children Michael, 14, Daniel, five and four-year-old Amy), has had to remember the past using pictures and videos

Blank: Sarah, pictured with her family, did not know who her husband or children were when she awoke from her coma

When Sarah Thomson, 32, awoke from her coma in November, she believed it was still 1998 and she was only 19 years old.

She awoke thinking the world was a very different place...

Mrs Thomson collapsed when a blood clot in her brain caused by malformed blood vessels started to trap spinal fluid.

'I remember looking at some pictures on the computer when I felt something ping at the back of my neck,' she said.

'I started feeling weird and seeing 
splodges in my vision. I took myself to bed and the last thing I 
remember was being in an ambulance.'

She said she had to fall in love with 
her husband, a 34-year-old IT worker, for a second time and he had 
helped by taking her to their old haunts.

'I told him I loved him for 
the first time at Christmas – it felt like I was saying it to him for 
the very first time. I had butterflies.

'I feel a bit like a teenager at 
the moment. I dye my hair all different colours and can get really 
moody.

'He's had to get used to the new me! But he's stuck by me through 
it all, he's just been amazing.

'A while back I had a bit of a 
meltdown because I was fighting trying to remember the person I was, but
I realised I can't let what happened define me.'

Huge gaps: The 32-year-old only remembered her younger days, left, and had completely forgotten significant events in her life including the birth of son Daniel, right, who is now five
