Valerie Trierweiler has avoided the limelight since being dumped by Francois Hollande in January – but stepped back in to it this week with a message on Twitter that has infuriated the president and could derail his state visit to Mexico.

On Wednesday France’s former first lady tweeted her support for a French woman embroiled in a custody battle with a powerful Mexican politician, just as Hollande arrived in Mexico on a mission to improve relations between the two countries.

The tweet said: ‘I support @MaudeVersini who has not seen her 3 children, held by their father in Mexico, for 847 days.’

It also urged the French Foreign Ministry to intervene, with the final part of the message including its Twitter handle.

It added: ‘We must help her. @francediplo must act.’

The incendiary tweet referred to Ms Versini’s legal battle with former Mexico governor Arturo Montiel.

She claims that Montiel kidnapped her children during a 2011 Christmas reunion and has used his political clout to prevent them from leaving Mexico.

However, Montiel just happens to be a friend and ally of Mexico’s president, Enrique Pena Nieto.

And Mr Hollande is meeting with Mr Nieto for trade talks, deemed vital in light of France and Mexico’s recently fractured relationship.

The two countries have been at loggerheads over the case of Frenchwoman Florence Cassez, who was sentenced by Mexico to 60 years in prison on kidnapping charges in 2005.

However, pressure from Paris brought about her release after she’d served seven years, which infuriated Mexicans.

A French diplomat told the Daily Telegraph that Hollande is livid about the tweet, which would ‘certainly not help’ his olive-branch strategy.

He added: ‘The purpose of this visit is to signal a new chapter in bilateral relations.’
