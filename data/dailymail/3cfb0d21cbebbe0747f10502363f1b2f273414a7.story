State senator Ernie Chambers, a liberal-leaning independent from North Omaha, was speaking in Nebraska's unicameral capitol building when he said, 'My ISIS is the police.'

The state senator (above, in blue shirt) responded to statements from colleague Tommy Garrett (inset) that residents were afraid of ISIS by criticizing police and comparing them to the terrorist group

Senator Tommy Garrett, a sponsor of the bill, said that the measure was necessary because residents of Nebraska were afraid of terrorist groups, according to The Omaha World Herald.

'Nobody from ISIS ever terrorized us as a people as the police do daily,' Chambers said.

'The police are licensed to kill us,' he said. 'My home is not threatened by ISIS, mine is threatened by the police.'

The senator, who is African-American, described instances of seeing police brutality against blacks. 

Though the liberal legislator said that he was a nonviolent person, he added that he would carry a weapon against police.

'If I carried a gun, I would want to shoot [a police officer] first and then ask questions later like they say the cop ought to do.'

Members of the legislature spent hours criticizing the statements this week after they were picked up by conservative talk radio.

The legislator has faced numerous calls for an apology or resignation, including from US Representative from Nebraska Jeff Fortenberry (pictured, file photo)

State Sen David Schnoor called for Chambers to resign, according to Watchdog.org.

Republican legislature member Beau McCoy said he would ask for an apology every day and was later joined in the request 

US Representative from Nebraska Jeff Fortenberry called for the legislature to censure Chambers.

He said that 'condoning violence against police is reckless and contradicts the sacred duty of a lawmaker to protect society.'

Despite widespread condemnation of his statements, Chambers refuses to back away from his remarks.

'I meant what I said and I said what I meant,' he said.

'I’m not going to resign,” he said. 'I’m not going to apologize.' 

Extra police troopers were stationed at the Nebraska capitol building on Thursday and Friday. 

Chambers has refused to back down from his statements about police and ISIS and said he would not resign or apologize

Last week's incident was not the first race-related controversy in recent Nebraska politics. Republican Party member Pat McPherson (pictured) was found to have written a blog that called President Obama a 'half-breed'

Several other members of the Nebraska legislature said they did not condone their colleague's statements, but said that they would defend his right to free speech. 

Expelling Chambers for the remainder of the legislative session would require 33 out of 49 votes.

He has previously criticized police and made inflammatory speeches during more than four decades serving in the legislature.

The senator previously gained national attention n 2007 when he filed a lawsuit against God for natural disasters as a statement against frivolous lawsuits.

He is famous within his state for wanting to end mountain lion hunting and writing poems about other political figures while drawing them. 

Chambers also made headlines earlier this year when he said that all white people were racist in the wake of another race-related scandal in Nebraska politics. around Pat McPherson, a Nebraska Republican Party member.

A member of the GOP's State Central Committee Pat McPherson, was discovered to have written a blog with racist posts, including one that called President Barack Obama a 'half-breed.'

McPherson faced calls to resign from both parties, but has not done so.
