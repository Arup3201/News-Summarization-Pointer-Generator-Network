In the same week that a family signed a 20-year lease to live on St Bees Island, one woman was so desperate to get off the private oasis that her friends made a huge SOS sign in the sand.

The 62-year-old woman fell out of a coconut tree on Thursday and had to be airlifted off the island with spinal injuries after landing on a rock.

Her friends made the SOS sign along with a cross and and arrow to help rescue choppers easily locate them on the island just off the coast of Mackay, north Queensland.

Desperate measures: The injured woman's friends resorted to writing SOS in the sand after she fell from a coconut tree

The RACQ-CQ was so impressed with the forethought of the group that they were praised on Twitter.

‘Landing spot on #StBeesIsland made much easier to find by a big SOS in the sand. 2nd time this has helped this year!’.

In April, five people left stranded after their boat broke anchor 30km's north-east of Mackay were also rescued after emergency crews spotted their SOS message written on a sandbank.

Meanwhile, the new leaseholders of paradise will be the sole occupants of St Bees Island, which features three sea shanty-style cottages, a 100,000-litre water supply, a power generator and lots of coconut trees.

'There's not a lot to it, it's quite simple,' Mackay and Marina Real Estate licensee Kim Griffiths told Daily Mail Australia.

A Gold Coast family signed a 20-year lease for less than $1 million this week

A Gold Coast woman, her son and partner will be moving to the 1,100-hectare island. However the residential lease covers about 4 hectares as the rest of the land is a national park.

Mr Griffiths described the couple, in their 60s, as 'quite eccentrically private'.

'They just had the normal reservations in terms of isolation – when living a metropolitan style life you attach yourself to lifestyle habits but I think they're just looking forward to living a simple island life that most of us only fantasise about,' he said.

'They're heading towards the island now and they're bringing up a convoy of boats to potter around on and she's going to grow veggies.'

Mr Griffiths said the lease was advertised for $985,000 but could not reveal the final figure.

The Gold Coast family were among hundreds of inquiries, most within Australia and New Zealand but also including interests from Europe and Asia

The agent said several people had lived on the island over the last century.

'The bays the only part of island that’s ever been lived on – just the little beach there,' Mr Griffiths said.

'It just the typical idyllic screen saver with palm trees and all.'

The island was originally owned by the Bourke family but the surviving holder of the lease took on some partners and formed a local syndicate of businessmen.

'They used it for family holidays for about 5 or 10 years and then they wanted to go their separate ways and so they put it on the market,' Mr Griffiths said.

The Gold Coast family were among hundreds of inquiries which were mostly from Australia and New Zealand but also generated interests from Europe and Asia.

'People inquire because the dreams always there: it reads pretty well, peoples see the photos and think 'wow' – it doesn't get much better cause it's still one of the most beautiful coastal regions of the world,' Mr Griffiths said.

The island was originally marketed for a 12 month lease and about three people inspected the island.
