A young couple who receive more than 
£17,000 a year in benefits appeared on ITV's This Morning to defend 
their taxpayer-funded lifestyle this week.

Danny Creamer, 21, and Gina Allan, 
18, who live in a comfortable two-bedroom flat in Portsmouth  with their
four month old daughter, Talulah Rose, infuriated viewers and Daily Mail readers as they argued they are better off on £17k benefits and that unless they are 
able to find jobs that pay £18,000 a year or more, there's no point in 
working.

With hours of the show airing a business owner had contacted the show and offered Danny a job working for his firm.

Entitlement: Gina Allen and Danny Creamer say they are entitled to benefits because the Government wouldn't provide them if they didn't need them

During the interview Danny admitted 
that he would consider a job offer over £15,000, and on Wednesday's show
host Phillip Schofield said: 'A 
businessman phoned up, and Danny was offered a labourer's job, £60 a day
at this James Oliver's Property Developer company, and he's taken it. 
They've arranged a meeting for tomorrow....'

Holly added, "They said they were 
impressed with Danny's attitude yesterday and I think his benefits were 
coming in near to £18,000 so he will be taking a bit of a cut to 
£15,600, but at least he's working... well done Danny.'

On Tuesday's show the couple hit back
at those who describe them as scroungers, arguing that because their 
hard-working parents have paid tax all their lives, they are entitled to
claim some of the money back.

Gina, who has worked for Sainsburys in the past said: 'I don’t see that we’re living off the taxpayers, we’re entitled to the money our parents paid all their lives.'

She also claimed that because the pair have paid tax in the past, their daughter should also be entitled to claim benefits in future.

'We have paid into the system as well 
and you know, if our daughter wants to claim when she's older, she can. We're not
going to claim benefits forever so we are going to pay into the system at some point.'

The pair receive £1,473 per month in benefits or £17,680 per year.

This works out at £340 per week, which includes £140 housing benefit, £60 child tax credit, £20 child benefit and £110 Jobseekers Allowance.

Weekly outgoings include £60 on food, £22.50 on TV, £3.50 on their TV licence plus utility bills, which the pair say they receive no help with.

According to Gina, their 47" flat screen TV is their only luxury, although Danny also admits to smoking roll-up cigarettes which are also paid for by tax payers.

Shocked: Hosts Phillip Schofield and Holly Willoughby appeared shocked by the couples' comments

Angry: Radio presenter Nick Ferarri said he was angry with the system but felt some sympathy for the pair

Although neither have any 
qualifications, Danny, who has also worked as a shelf stacker in the 
past, admitted he is now looking for a job - although said he won't accept 
any old role.

'What is the point [of a minimum wage job]? You know, I'm not going to go to work to be worse off.' he argued.

Gina added: 'The main problem is is that the cost of living is going up so much but the wages are just the same. But people still expect you to live on the minimum wage - I don't think that's right.'

When pressed the pair maintained that they will carry on living on benefits until Danny gets a job that pays enough or 'the system changes'.

'We'll carry on until the system changes if Danny doesn't get a job,' said Gina. 

Danny added: 'We can't be scroungers because the Government wouldn't give us the money or pay towards our living expenses
if we didn't need it.'

Taxes: The duo say they are right to claim benefits because their parents have paid taxes all their lives

Unfortunately for Danny and Gina, the change in the system they so dread isn't far away.

In a statement read out on This Morning, the Department for Work and Pensions said: 'We have to end the absurdity in the 
welfare system where people are better off claiming benefits than they 
are in work.

'Universal Credit will ensure that work will always pay and 
people who can work will no longer be able to count on the state to fund
a life on benefits.'

Asked what they intend to do when the new system is introduced, Gina quickly replied: 'He'd have to get a job I suppose.'

LBC radio presenter and Sunday Express columnist, Nick Ferrari, who was present during the couple's appearance told them: 'What you two have done is a great shame. You've seen it as a lifestyle choice and it's something you choose to do. You shouldn't.'
