A Michigan father is standing by his autistic son - even after he returned home in February to find that the 19-year-old had horrifically slashed his wife to death and was sitting in a bathtub playing in her remains.

Ronald Grow stood and hugged his mentally-ill son David Kellen Grow on Friday as a judge in Jackson, Michigan found the teen not guilty, but insane. He will be committed to a high-security psychiatric ward, where he will likely stay for the rest of his life.

Mr Grow testified that he still visits his son every week in the mental hospital where he is currently housed. New medication has made him sleepy, but ensured that he is 'the boy I've always known.'

Judge Thomas Wilson ruled Friday that David Grow - who has autism and a history of mental illness and hallucinations - was not in control of himself when he brutally slaughtered his mother Robin Grow, 49.

Ronald Grow came home February 20 to find a truly horrific scene. His wife has been flayed open in the family's bathroom. The wounds were grievous that her entrails had spilled out onto the floor, the Jackson Citizen Patriot reports.

Detectives later found the murder weapon, a steak knife, inside Mrs Grow's body cavity.

Mr Grow found his son sitting in the bathtub with Mrs Grow's intestinal tract wrapped around his neck.

'That wasn't my son,' Mr Grow testified, speaking of the condition he found David in.

'He was victimized by something that he had no control over,' he told the Citizen Patriot after the hearing.

Mr Grow broke down only once as he described the unimaginable scene he found in his Concord, Michigan, home.

Since that time, he was been working to support his son and help him avoid prison.

Before he took the stand Friday, Mr Grow visited David at his psychiatric cell and told him that he was going to have to describe that day in February to the court - but that they would 'get through it together.'

He said he visits his son every Saturday and will continue to work with him after he is committed to the Center for Forensic Psychiatry, a maximum security state mental hospital.

State psychiatrists thoroughly examined David Grow and concluded that he was having a psychotic episode when he killed his mother.

The 19-year-old's parents had hospitalized him for mental instability for 10 days in January until a judge ordered that he be released against his parents wishes. It was 23 days later that he allegedly murdered his mother.

Grow 'had delusions of a demon getting 
in his second floor bedroom window and harming him and his family,' 
Grow’s father, Ronald Grow, wrote in a chilling 'petition for 
hospitalization' dated January 25.

Grow 'had delusions of a demon getting in his second floor bedroom window and harming him and his family,' Grow¿s father, Ronald Grow, wrote in a chilling 'petition for hospitalization' dated Jan. 25

When he was hospitalized on Jan. 18, 
he was 'having disorganized speech' and actively chanting and 
hallucinating, physician assistant Jennifer Underwood wrote in a 
petition for hospitalization.

The petition noted that his behavior was
'substantially supportive' of the expectation that he would hurt 
himself or someone else.

Dr. Aurif A. Abedi reported in the petition that Grow was unable to communicate and lacked 'total insight.'

Another doctor wrote that he was confused and incoherent, while a third doctor called him 'acutely psychotic.'

But Judge Diane Rappleye denied the petition to keep him hospitalized and ordered him discharged.

Twenty-three days later, he killed his mother.

At his arraignment in February, Grow was somewhat unresponsive and barely spoke, apart from mumbling to himself.

Judge Daniel Goostrey had to ask him to confirm his identity several times before he eventually nodded to acknowledge his name.
