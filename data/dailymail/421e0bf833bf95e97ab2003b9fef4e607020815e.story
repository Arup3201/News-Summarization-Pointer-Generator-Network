A Massachusetts teenager who witnessed the murder of his friend's mother on an iPad during an online chat took the stand against the woman's alleged killer Friday and told the court how heard 39-year-old Chris Piantedosi tell the victim 'you've got to die' as he repeatedly stabbed her with a knife.

Authorities say Piantedosi fatally stabbed his girlfriend and mother of his two children, Kristen Pulisciano, in May of 2012. One of the couple's 15-year-old daughter's friends, 16-year-old Michael Edwards, was chatting with the girl online when the murder took place, and he witnessed much of it.

'She was saying, ''No, Chris, stop, I love you,''' Edwards told the court of the stabbing.

Murdered: Kristen Pulisciano, 38, left, was found to stabbed to death by her husband Christopher Piantedosi, 39, right. It has now emerged one of their daughters' friends witnessed the attack over a video chat

He went on to describe Piantedosi as 'wide-eyed' as he was stabbing Pulisciano.

The couple's children also witnessed the stabbing. It's unclear whether they will testify against their father.

The teen was chatting with Edwards on her iPad in her bedroom when she heard her parents arguing in the kitchen. She told Edwards she would 'be right back' and left the iPad running.

The daughter ran to the kitchen, where Piantedosi grabbed a knife. 'What, are you trying to kill Mum or something?' the girl said, according to prosecutors.

Piantedosi chased Pulisciano into the bedroom and stabbed her with a butcher knife, prosecutors said. Edwards was still 
logged into the video, the gruesome murder playing out in front of his eyes.

'He could hear the victim saying, 
"Please, please". He could hear the daughter yelling, "No. No". He then 
heard the defendant say, "You gotta die. You gotta die",' prosecutors told 
the court at Piantedosi's arraignment.

'He then heard the victim say, "Chris, please stop. I love you" and then the defendant began stabbing Kristen numerous times.'

Prosecutors said Pulisciano died of a stab wound to the neck as her two children watched on.

Neighbours said the couple's children - the teenage daughter and a 20-year-old son -
fled the house, screaming that their mother had been killed after the horrific attack.

'She 
was crying. Her brother was crying. I saw him crying on the lawn,' one 
neighbour said.

When police responded to the scene at 6:45 pm, Pulisciano was dead with multiple stab wounds..

Piantedosi, who initially
fled the scene,  turned himself in to police after a 
warrant was issued for his arrest.

He was allegedly found lying in the grass outside Weston State Police Barracks, according to Fox.

When he was approached by officers, he told them he had taken something but they recognised him and took him into custody.

Police had issued a statement saying Piantedosi was considered to be armed and dangerous and thought to be driving a brown 
Honda Civic with Massachusetts license plate 581MC8.

When police searched his car, they found two handwritten notes on the dashboard, the Union Leader reported.

One said: 'Unarmed. Just have to sleep.' Another said: 'I put knife on table. Continued talking. She grabbed again. I grabbed a bigger one. Went at it in front of daughter. No, no, no, no.'

Piantedosi is known to police. Last 
year, he was dubbed the 'remorseful robber' after he showed up at a 
woman’s door to return cash and a GPS he had stolen from her at a grocery store.

He allegedly wrote a letter saying 'I'm sorry' and signed it 'stupid'.
