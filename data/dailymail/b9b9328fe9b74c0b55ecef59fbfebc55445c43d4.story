A huge fire broke out on a cross-Channel ferry carrying more than 300 passengers as it was arriving in France this morning.

Some 337 passengers and 119 crew were on the Pride of Canterbury P&O vessel, which had sailed from Dover in Kent, when the blaze broke out in the engine room at about 9am local time (8am BST).

Passenger Ed Sproston, of Folkestone, Kent, was on the ferry - which had left Dover at 6.30am - and took photographs of the thick toxic fumes, which he said left him struggling for breath.

Blaze: Father-of-two Ed Sproston, of Folkestone, Kent, was on the ferry - which had left Dover at 6.30am - and took a photograph (above) of the thick toxic fumes, which he said left him struggling for breath

Smoking: Mr Sproston said the fire was blazing for 'a good 20 minutes' before it was extinguished

The 39-year-old father-of-two said: ‘I 
was sitting upstairs talking to my kids on the phone when the captain 
came on the tannoy and said they had a “slight problem with the 
starboard engine”.

‘He said 
we were going to have a tug boat pull us into the port but then I just 
saw plumes of smoke coming out of the engine room. The alarm started 
going off.

‘Then
 they said they wanted to evacuate us all to the foot passengers’ exit. 
There were big plumes of smoke coming out and large pieces of ash were 
just falling from the sky.’

The truck driver added: ‘It is lucky we weren't out at sea. I would have jumped out if I
 needed to but there were young children and babies on board.

'A
 lot of people were panicking and the crew were trying to calm them 
down. But it was all a bit disorganised. My lungs are still hurting now.
 You could smell the smoke and taste it as well.'

Fire: P&O said nobody was injured and an investigation would be carried out to find the fire's cause

Smoke damage: Some 337 passengers and 119 crew were on the Pride of Canterbury P&O vessel

Mr Sproston said the fire was blazing for ‘a good 20 minutes’ before it was extinguished by the sprinklers. P&O said the blaze started in the engine room before it was put out by the sprinklers.

The firm said nobody was injured and an investigation would be carried out to find the fire’s cause, which had caused mainly smoke damage in the engine room.

A P&O spokesman said: ‘The fire was extinguished straight away by the sprinkler system. There were no injuries, either among the crew or passengers. The passengers disembarked as normal.’

One round-trip service, the 9.50am from Calais and the 11.10am from Dover, was cancelled to enable the damage to be assessed. There are four other P&O ships serving the Dover-Calais route.
