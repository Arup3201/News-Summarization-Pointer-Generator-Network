Russell Wilson fired a 35-yard touchdown strike to Jermaine Kearse in overtime to give the Seattle Seahawks a stunning  comeback win over the Green Bay Packers on Sunday and seal a return trip to the Super Bowl.

The Seahawks, bidding to become the first team in a decade to win back-to-back Super Bowls, will now play the New England Patriots after they hammered the Indianapolis Colts.

Trailing 19-7 the Seahawks scored 15 points in 44 seconds late in the fourth quarter - Wilson and Marshawn Lynch each powering their way into the end zone for touchdowns and adding a two-point conversion to surge ahead 22-19.

The drama was far from over, as the Packers' Mason Crosby booted his fifth field goal of the day to send the NFC championship into overtime where Russell hit a streaking Kearse for the winning score as CenturyLink Field exploded in celebration.

The touchdown was a spectacular and breathtaking end to a game pitting Seattle's top-ranked defence against the NFL's No 1 scoring offence led by quarterback Aaron Rodgers.

The contest had taken on a funeral atmosphere for much of the game as Seattle's Super Bowl reign appeared headed to an end.

But Wilson, who had misfired most of the day throwing four interceptions, flashed his champion's pedigree when it mattered most, leading a fourth-quarter rally and engineering what is already being hailed as one of the greatest post-season comebacks in NFL history.

Rodgers, playing with an injured calf, removed any doubts about his fitness, dissecting the Seahawks vaunted defense as the Packers dominated the opening half and stormed to a 16-0 lead to silence the famously raucous Seattle crowd known as the 12th man.

The Packers were in command on both sides of the ball, their defence intercepting Wilson three times in the first half as the Seattle quarterback failed to complete his first pass until late in the second quarter.

Seattle finally got on the scoreboard with a bit of razzle dazzle, faking a punt and holder Jon Ryan hitting a wide open Garry Gilliam with a 19-yard touchdown pass to chop the Green Bay lead to 16-7.

The Packers took some of the steam out of Seattle's comeback bid in the fourth quarter when Crosby booted a 48-yard field goal to put the visitors ahead 19-7.

But with time running out Wilson kept hopes alive when he ran over from the one with 2:09 left on the clock, then Seattle recovered the onside kick.

Lynch sprinted 24 yards for a touchdown and the Seahawks added a two-point conversion to push in front 22-19.

But with 1:25 to play a limping Rodgers marched Green Bay into Seattle territory where Crosby booted a 48-yard field goal to send the contest into overtime.
