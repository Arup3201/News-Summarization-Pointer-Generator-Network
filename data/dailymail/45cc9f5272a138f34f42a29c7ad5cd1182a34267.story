Scott Parker covered £20,000 in fines handed out to two young Fulham players by Felix Magath as he felt their punishment was too harsh.

The revelation is the latest in a string of bizarre incidents that have come to light in the aftermath of the German manager's sacking from the west London club.

The Mirror claim that Magath punished two younger members of Fulham's squad, handing them each a £10,000 fine.

Fulham's captain went to discuss the matter with Magath and said that, although their actions may have deserved punishment, the level of the fines was disproportionately high.

Both of the players were thought to be less than £2,000 a week, making the fines, at best, close to 10 per cent of their yearly wage packet.

But Magath refused to change his mind on the matter and so the 33-year-old Parker paid the fines himself.

Fulham's owner Shahid Khan sacked Magath after the club's poor start to the season. The Cottagers had taken just one point from their first seven games.

Khan expressed regret over having to take such action but said: 'I am doing what I feel is right and needed for Fulham, for today as well as tomorrow.'

Former Wales and Fulham defender Kit Symons was installed as his replacement on a temporary basis.
