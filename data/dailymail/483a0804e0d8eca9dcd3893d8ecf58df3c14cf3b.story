The Massachusetts woman accused of beating and strangling her pregnant friend to death then cutting the baby out of her womb and claiming the child as her own was convicted of first-degree murder on Wednesday.

Julie Corey sobbed as a Worcester Superior Court jury found her guilty of the 2009 murder of 23-year-old Darlene Haynes. The jurors had deliberated for 10 hours over two days. Sentencing has been scheduled for Tuesday.

Prosecutors said Haynes was eight months pregnant when Corey attacked her and cut the baby out of her body.

They told the jury that Corey had been pregnant, too, but had a miscarriage three months earlier and told her boyfriend and family that Haynes' baby was her own.

'It's probably the most horrific case this office has ever seen in terms of facts,' District Attorney Joseph Early Jr. said in a statement after the verdict was handed down. 'This woman was killed for her baby.'

Corey, 39, did not testify during the trial.

Corey's lawyers contended that police failed to follow up on leads that could have implicated other potential suspects in the killing, including Haynes' ex-boyfriend.

They also suggested that Haynes' ex-boyfriend had given Corey and her boyfriend, Alex Dion, the baby. Dion denied that on the witness stand.

Defense lawyer Michael Wilcox said he was disappointed with the verdict, but not surprised. He said they plan to appeal.

'We were aware of the evidence against her,' Wilcox said, adding that the facts alone in the case were difficult to discuss.

'We worked very hard to present the jury with a different picture, but we weren't ultimately successful.'

Wilcox said he would not comment on Corey's reaction but said it was understandable that she was upset.

'She faced the somber realization that she will spend the rest of her life in prison,' he said.

Haynes' body was found in a closet in her apartment on July 27, 2009.

She had been beaten in the head and strangled with an electrical cord. Her abdomen had been cut open, and her baby was gone.

Corey, Dion and Haynes' baby were found two days later at a homeless shelter in Plymouth, New Hampshire.

The gruesome phenomenon of foetus snatching has claimed a number of victims across the US

1987: Cindy Ray, 23, abducted by Darci Pierce, 19, outside a pre-natal clinic in New Mexico, strangled, then had her eight-month old foetus cut out. Baby Millie survived. Pierce is serving 30-years in jail

1995: Debbie Evans, 28, shot and stabbed to death by ex-boyfriend Laverne Ward, 24, in Illionis, along with two of her three children. The 38-week-old male foetus, which Ward planned to give to his femal cousin, survived. Ward was sentenced to death.

1996: Carethia Curry, 17, of Alabama murdered by mother-of-two Felicia Scott, 37, who stole her unborn baby girl and passed it off as her own. Scott was sentenced to life without parole.

2000: Michelle Bica, 39, invited pregnant Theresa Andrews, 23, to her home in Ohio to buy a car, shot her dead and cut out her nearly full-term foetus. Baby Oscar survived. Bica committed suicide.

2004: Lisa Montgomery, 36, killed Bobbi Jo Stinnett, 23, at her Missouri home and cut out her eight-month-old foetus. The baby girl survived. Montgomery was sentenced to death.

2006: Police in Illinois found Tiffany Hall, 26, in a park with a dead foetus she claimed had been stillborn. The baby girl's real mother, Jimella Tunstall, was found dead on nearby wasteland. Hall was jailed for life.

2011: Annette Morales-Rodriguez, 34, killed 23-year-old Maritza Ramirz-Cruz and sliced out her foetus after following her into a Milwaukee bathroom and attacking her with a baseball bat. The baby boy unfortunately died.Â 

Her lawyers acknowledged that she was found with the baby but said she played no role in Haynes' slaying.

Dion said that he and Corey, who has an 11-year-old son from a previous relationship, had dated on and off for about two years and in October 2008 she told him she was pregnant.

Dion testified that Corey, whom he 
believed was pregnant at the time, called him on July 23, 2009, and told
 him she was giving Haynes a ride to a store.

Later that night, Corey called him to say her water had broken and a friend was taking her to the hospital to give birth, Dion said.

A couple of hours later, Corey called him again and said, 'We had a baby,' Dion testified.

Dion said Corey arrived home the next morning with a baby girl he believed was his daughter. He said he and Corey introduced the baby to family and friends over the next couple of days.

But at the celebration which followed, some relatives were suspicious when Corey said she had been in labor for only 20 minutes and had returned home five hours later.

She appeared to be breast-feeding the baby under a blanket but there was a bottle of formula milk nearby.

The tiny girl's umbilical cord also did not look like it had been cut by a doctor and was tied with a ribbon. Friends contacted police after hearing of Haynes's death.

After Corey's arrest, Dion told a newspaper in Worcester, 'I am so confused. I don't know what to think. I thought I had a brand new daughter.'

When asked why it has taken five years to go to trial, Paul Jarvey, a spokesperson for Worcester District Attorney Joseph D. Early Jr said, 'It's just a complicated case.'

Dion's family said Corey introduced a baby girl to them at a family gathering on July 25, 2009, two days before Haynes' body was discovered.

Several days later, authorities found Corey, Dion and the baby at a homeless shelter in Plymouth, N.H. Dion was not charged.

DNA testing showed that Haynes, 23, was the mother of the baby.

The girl, who is now 4, is living with her biological father, Roberto Rodriguez, said Paul Jarvey, a spokesman for Worcester District Attorney Joseph Early Jr.
