Lord Patten is facing mounting pressure to resign today after it was revealed he has ten other jobs earning him up to £200,000 a year.

Despite earning £110,000 a year as BBC Trust chairman, the former-Tory Cabinet minister is only expected to be performing 'Trust duties' three or four days a week - but in reality does only three.

The rest of the time he is occupying himself with five other paid roles and five voluntary roles.

BBC Trust chairman. Pay: £110,000 a year for 'three days a week'

He is paid reportedly nearly £80,000 a year as an adviser to oil company BP, plus up to £40,000 from energy company EDF.

He also receives 'occasional' income from writing and speaking engagements.

One of his unpaid roles includes the prestigious post of Chancellor at Oxford University.

One senior Tory figure has called for
 Lord Patten to resign, saying he has been spread too thin by his 
commitments to other jobs.

Tory MP Philip Davies told 
MailOnline: 'Lord Patten has been asleep at the wheel as Chairman of the
 BBC; unaware of things he should have known about and slow to act at 
any stage of the BBC crisis and his judgment has been shown to be 
faulty.

'The likeliest explanation for these 
failings is that he has so many other jobs he hasn't given the BBC Trust
 the focus it deserves.

'Lord Patten is part of the problem not part of the solution and he should resign.'

Lord Patten is also a non-executive director at headhunting firm Russell Reynolds Associates.

A non-executive director is expected to be present at monthly management meetings and on average 18-20 other days throughout the year.

He will earn an estimated £15,000 a year based on figures from the Institute of Directors on the average pay for a non-executive director at a medium sized company.

As BP adviser he is expected to attend two meetings and offer advice. For EDF he attends four meetings.

There are 12 BBC Trustees, all of 
whom are appointed by the Queen on advice from ministers.

As they are all appointed part-time, they are able to fulfill other roles.

During the first six months of this year the BBC Chairman spent 78 days on BBC business - accounting for three days a week.

But the BBC said not all of that time was in Trust offices.

A BBC Trust spokesman told MailOnline: 'In the period in question, the Chairman spent 78 days formally on BBC 
business, the majority of them in the Trust offices, and on many other 
occasions in other BBC buildings.

'That works out at three days a week, 
which is what he is supposed to do, and that takes no account of the 
fact that he is available seven days a week to deal with BBC business on
 an ad hoc basis.  Ultimately, what building he is in is an immaterial 
point.

'The fact is that he is always available for BBC business.'

Vice chair Diane Coyle holds ten positions, and is on the same EDF panel as Lord Patten.

His other duties are all publicly documented in the 'Register of Lords' interests'.

Lord Patten is also a member of the European Advisory Board for Bridgepoint, a private equity group, and an adviser for telecomms company Hutchison Europe.

He is co-chair of UK-India Round Table, taking up three days a year, and co-chair of the British Council in Italy's annual conference.

Earlier this week Lord Patten insisted the BBC would go through a 'radical overhaul' in the wake of George Entwistle's dramatic resignation as director general on Saturday after just seven weeks in the job.

He said Mr Entwistle left the Corporation 'extremely honourably' and was taking responsibility for the 'awful journalism' that saw Newsnight wrongly label a Tory peer a paedophile.

He told The Andrew Marr Show: 'Throughout this in the way the BBC has covered ourselves, our credibility depends on telling the truth about ourselves and others, however horrible it might be.'

Lord Patten has so far defied pressure to resign.
