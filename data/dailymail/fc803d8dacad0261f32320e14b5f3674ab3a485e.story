A woman spent seven days in a rental car after she accidentally drove it into a muddy pond - then decided to stick strictly to advice that she was not to leave her vehicle if she became stranded.

Lynn Keesler,
61, took a wrong turn while looking for a hotel and drove into the water on January 15. She finally walked to a nearby house for help on January 22.

Mrs Keesler
told police she had been trying to find a hotel in Burley, Idaho. She saw a body of water by a dairy factory
and thought it was the Snake River which was mentioned in her directions. As she began to drive
around the edge of the pond, the car became stuck in mud.

The
first night she was stranded she flashed her headlights until
the car's battery died. She told officers she also honked the 
horn a couple times when the battery would power up enough.

The woman, from Houston, Texas, survived the seven days stuck in the car by eating peanut butter M&Ms and drinking bottled water.

She finally climbed out of the car when the water level in the pond began to rise on Sunday, the Times-New reported today.

She was evaluated by emergency services but refused to go to hospital saying she just wanted 'a warm bed and a bath'.

The
dairy boss told deputies that workers started filling the settling
ponds on Friday. When deputies arrived, the ponds were full and the car
was hardly visible.

Representatives
from Enterprise Rent-A-Car told police officers that Mrs Keesler had rented the vehicle
on December 8 and was supposed to return it on January 5.
