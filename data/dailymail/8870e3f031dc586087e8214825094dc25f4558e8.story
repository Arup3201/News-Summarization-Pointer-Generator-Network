Do not follow me if you want to win a medal, was David Rudisha’s friendly advice to Kenyan team-mate Timothy Kitum before he stunned the world by setting a world record of 1min 40.91sec to win Olympic 800 metres gold at London 2012. He knew nobody would be able to live with the pace he planned to run.

Rudisha’s was the stand-out performance of the Games; arguably not only on the track but of the entire Olympics. Lord Coe, who held the 800m world record for 16 years, called it the most extraordinary piece of running he had ever seen and the greatest 800m run.

It will be impossible for Rudisha to recreate the magic of those 100 seconds at Hampden Park over the next three days, but we should still expect another majestic performance from one of the world’s greatest athletes in one of the track’s toughest disciplines.

Man to beat: Kenya's David Rudisha is favourite to win gold in the 800 metres final in Glasgow

Record breaker: Rudisha shows off his world record after winning gold at the London 2012 Olympic Games

Usain Bolt may only be turning up to run
 a couple of relay legs in the 4x100m, but the Commonwealth 800m title 
is one this tall, softly-spoken Maasai is desperate to win.

‘The 800m is the most unforgiving distance,’ said Coe. ‘You are running 80 per cent of the race without oxygen. I call it “the killing zone”. I think 800m is the toughest distance on the track. It demands so many different things: the endurance of a 5,000m runner and the speed of a world-class 800m runner.’

To make things even harder, Rudisha will face Nijel Amos from Botswana. The 20-year-old won silver in London and beat Rudisha into fifth place in Monaco this month by running 1:42.45, the fastest time in the world this year.

Rudisha missed last season with a knee injury, but returned to British soil in the Diamond League meeting at Hampden to win comfortably in 1:43.34. Rudisha, after all, knows only one way to run — from the front — which is why experts believe he could go even quicker.

Dr Jamie 
Pringle, lead physiologist at the English Institute of Sport, said: 
‘Aerodynamically, sitting on someone else’s shoulder saves you a lot of 
energy, which you can save for that final kick.

‘But
 Rudisha likes to run from the front, usually as soon as he can break 
after the first 200m, which is run in lanes. That’s what made his 
performance in London so remarkable.

‘He has to work harder and the people trying to hang on behind him are benefiting from running in his draft. He could perhaps run even faster if there were people he could sit behind. You need a pacemaker who’s the world’s best over 400m and can hang on until 600m.’

Rudisha has been coy about breaking the 100-second barrier but said: ‘London was an Olympic final and I did it without a pacemaker,’ he said. ‘If I can catch the right pacing and the right conditions we might do better.’

Running from the front was a tactic the former 400m athlete, whose father Daniel won Olympic gold in the 4x400m relay in 1968, adopted after he failed to make the final at the 2009 World Championships in Berlin.

Rudisha’s coach, Irish missionary Brother Colm O’Connell, said: ‘I think he just turned over a new leaf and said: “I’m never going to be caught like that again”.’ In 2010 Rudisha set two world 800m records in a week.

A comparison of David Rudisha and Sebastian Coe's most memorable races

O’Connell first spotted Rudisha running 200m in 2004 and invited him to a training camp. The 16-year-old was given a pair of second-hand size 10 spikes and, in his first outing over two laps of the track, he ran 1min 50secs.

Rudisha has clearly long been an exceptional athlete. The question is: how good could he be if someone does have the talent to follow him?

Dr Paul Worsfold, head of biomechanics at the English Institute of Sport, discusses Rudisha's best attributes.

STANDING TALL

At 6ft 3in, Rudisha is a tall athlete — much taller than Britain’s finest 800m runner, Sebastian Coe — and he maintains an upward stance while running. A lot of athletes tilt their hips but he doesn’t do that, or lean too far forwards.

STRIDES AHEAD

Like Usain Bolt he has a long stride length and covers lots of distance with his long limbs, but he doesn’t over-stride or place his foot too far in front of him, which would act as a brake.Coe’s gait and stride pattern were shorter and quicker but Rudisha’s stride length allows him to maintain velocity throughout the whole race.

SMOOTH OPERATOR

He’s very smooth in the way he runs. There is not much vertical displacement — everything’s horizontal — which means he doesn’t lose energy unnecessarily. Rudisha doesn’t bounce like a lot of marathon or long distance runners.

MUSCLE MAN

Rudisha is a very muscular guy, he doesn’t seem to rotate the upper body too much and is very stable in his core, which gives him a lot of control and does not waste energy.

TOTAL PACKAGE

There have got to be natural genetics at play, in terms of his muscle fibres and his height, and he really does have the ideal body type. But you can tell he has worked very hard on his biomechanics. He’s not perfect but he’s technically very, very good and, like Bolt, he knows what works for him.
