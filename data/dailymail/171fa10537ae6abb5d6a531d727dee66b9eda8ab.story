Manchester United came from behind to beat plucky Preston on Monday night and set up an FA Cup quarter-final clash with Arsenal.

Here, Sportsmail's Chris Wheeler rates every player for their performance at Deepdale.

PRESTON (3-4-1-2)

Thorsten Stuckmann 6 – Sound performance but will be cursing Rooney for getting in his eye-line for the first goal and then going down under little or contact for the penalty he converted.

Tom Clarke 7 – Captain’s performance from Clarke and led by example but it just wasn’t quite enough in the end.

Paul Huntington 7 – Towering display summed up by a challenge on Fellaini in the second half, blocking the Belgian’s shot when he looked certain to score from close-range.

Bailey Wright 6 - Combative approach typified by his collision with Fellaini in the first half, but came under increasing pressure as the match wore on.

Chris Humphrey 6.5 – His powerful running down the right-flank for Preston gave Shaw plenty to worry about.

Jon Welsh 6.5 – Vital role sat in front of the back-four and one superbly-timed challenge on Di Maria brought a roar from the crowd.

Neil Kilkenny 6.5 – A veteran of Leeds’ cup upset at Old Trafford under Grayson five years, he couldn’t be faulted before going off 15 minutes from the end.

Scott Laird 7.5 – Scored a memorable goal that sent Deepdale into raptures and almost grabbed a second in added time when his header was cleared off the line by Young.

Paul Gallagher 7 – Preston’s man of the match, he produced a number of impressive set-pieces including one that went inches over in the second half.

Kevin Davies 6.5 – Still a handful at 37, United had two or even three players competing with him for high balls at times, and he was not surprisingly booked for flattening Herrera.

Joe Garner 7 – Simon Grayson said that he’d ruffle feathers and he certainly did. Preston’s top scorer went close to another with a header in the second half.

Subs: Hudson, Wiseman (for Wright 75, 6), Reid (for Kilkenny 75, 6), King, Robinson (for Davies 75, 6), Brownhill, Ebanks-Blake

Booked: Davies, Kilkenny, Laird, Stuckmann

MANCHESTER UNITED (4-1-3-2) 

David de Gea 5.5 –  The Spaniard has been United’s best player this season but he will be unhappy at the way he allowed Laird’s deflected effort to spin through his grasp when Preston took a shock lead early in the second half.

Antonio Valencia 6.5 – The man who deflected Laird’s shot, and the Ecuadorian could be faulted for not getting tighter on his opponent as he tried his luck from range. Helped set up Fellaini’s goal though.

Chris Smalling 5.5 – Looked uncomfortable again with the awkward combination of Kevin Davies’s power and Joe Garner’s sheer persistence causing him plenty of problems.

Marcos Rojo 6 – The Argentine also had his hands full with Preston’s front two and was booked for bringing down Garner in the second half.

Luke Shaw 6 – Back after suspension but is still yet to offer the kind of marauding presence United hoped they were getting when they signed him for £28m in the summer.

Daley Blind 7 – Screened the United defence capably and it was his determination to keep possession and pass that led to the equaliser.

Ander Herrera 6.5 – Given only his third start since the beginning of December and the man who came up with the breakthrough goal against Yeovil in the third round struck again here.

Marouane Fellaini 7 – Found that his powerful presence was less effective against the League One side, and ended up with a bloody nose after a clash with Bailey Wright, but came up with United’s crucial second goal.

Angel di Maria 8 – The only one to try and take the game by the scruff of the neck when United were in trouble, showing real character to go with his undoubted talent on a difficult night.

Wayne Rooney 6.5 – Back up front but the United skipper was a little subdued as his team had to come from behind before he won and converted the penalty for United’s third.

Radamel Falcao 5 – Failed to get on the end of Di Maria’s freekick early on and replaced with half an hour remaining after another mediocre display. No surprise United prospered after his departure.

Radamel Falcao struggled once again and was replaced by Ashley Young in the second half

Subs: Valdes, Evans, Mata, Januzaj, Young (for Falcao 60, 7), McNair, Wilson

Booked: Rojo

Referee: Phil Dowd

Star man: Angel di Maria
