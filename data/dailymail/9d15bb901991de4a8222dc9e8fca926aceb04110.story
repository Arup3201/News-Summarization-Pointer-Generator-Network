An embarrassing mix up between 'Legally Brown' comedian Nazeem Hussain and the new host of The Project Waleed Aly left ABC 7.30 host Leigh Sales tempted to make some changes to her usual opening address on the show last night.

Yesterday The Age incorrectly printed a photo of Hussain in their entertainment column with the caption: 'Waleed Aly joins The Project'.

Sales responded to the mishap by tweeting on Thursday afternoon: 'It's so tempting to open 7.30 tonight with "Welcome to the program, I'm Waleed Aly".'

The idea was met with great popularity as the tweet itself gained nearly 800 favourites and nearly 400 retweets as many pleaded Sales to go through with it.

ABC 7.30 host Leigh Sales was tempted to make some changes to her usual opening address on the show last night

The awkward blunder was spotted by the stand-up comedian, of Sri Lankan decent, who lightheartedly tweeted on Thursday morning: 'Well, we are kinda the same person...'

It has since gained more than 750 retweets, sparking comments such as: 'Brown people all look alike', 'Un-freaking-believable' and 'demonstrates why tv needs more non-white face'.

This follows last week's announcement that Aly secured a new role as the new co-host of Channel Ten's news program The Project.

Although Sales teased her audience on social media, she never went through with opening address she tweeted.

It also appears the so-called lookalikes, Aly and Hussain, were together last night as Aly's wife Susan Carlan tweeted a photo of the pair with the caption: 'Singularity.'

Aly, born and raised in Melbourne to Egyptian parents, is a frequent commentator on Australian Muslim affairs and has often spoken on the topic several times on ABC political show, Q&A. 

He is also a regular contributor for The Age.

When searching his name on the Melbourne-based newspaper's website, alongside his correct head-shot it states Aly 'writes fortnightly for The Age'.

The lawyer, 36, is no stranger on The Project and will be joining existing co-hosts Carrie Bickmore and Peter Helliar on the panel next year.

He will succeed Rove, who will leave the show after a pre-determined six month stint this month.

Aly appeared once a week on the program as a guest this year, but speculation was rife that he would take over from Rove after the end of his ABC roles this month on shows including The Big Idea.

It will also be an Australian first for TV as Aly becomes the first Muslim to co-host a major prime time television show.

Ironically, his so-called lookalike - Nazeem Hussain - is the creator and star of Australian television show 'Legally Brown' which presents a comedic take on life as a Muslim in Australia.

The 27-year-old is also a presenter on triple j radio.

Aly will start his new role on The Project from January 26.
