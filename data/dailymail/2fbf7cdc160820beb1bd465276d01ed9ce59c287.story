A former middle school teacher has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for the hit-and-run death of a six-year-old boy who was killed as he went to get candy for being good.

Tammy Lowe, a former Grand Prairie, Texas schoolteacher, was sentenced on Friday to eight years in prison for manslaughter and 10 years for failure to stop and render aid to John Raidy in 2013.

She will serve the sentences concurrently and is eligible for parole in four years. She faced as many as 20 years behind bars after being found guilty of manslaughter in Dallas County, Texas Thursday. 

On January 24, 2013, she ran a red light in Carrier Parkway, plowing down John Raidy as he crossed the street to get treats with his mother Lauren and little sister, who was in a stroller.

Guilty: Tammy Lowe, a former teacher, cries as she takes the stand in her manslaughter case this week. She was found guilty of manslaughter in the hit-and-run death of a six-year-old boy last year

Lauren Raidy watched in horror as the driver continued, carrying her son on the hood for about 300 feet, before stopping briefly and then speeding off. 

The deadly incident was captured on surveillance cameras outside nearby businesses. 

When Lowe got home, she told her husband that the damage to her car had been caused by kids at school. But five days later, after quitting her teaching job, she turned herself in to police.

Raidy's mother, Lauren Raidy-Brooks, testified about the heartbreaking incident on Tuesday and later sobbed during the closing arguments, Fox8 reported.

'I have this pain and there's a hole that won't go away,' the devastated mother said through tears. 'Nothing is going to bring my John back. But she did what she did and she needs to pay for it.'

Victim: John Raidy, pictured, had been walking across the crosswalk with his mother Lauren, right, and baby sister to get candy when they were plowed down by Lowe, who had failed to stop at a red light

In court, Lowe explained that she had always loved children. She had served on the Sunshine Committee at Adams Middle School, where she worked for almost 20 years, WFAA reported.

'I loved kids and they were drawn to me,' she told jurors. 

Arrested: Lowe, 54, quit her job and turned herself into police five days after the deadly accident

But in the incident in January of last year, she saw the small figure roll onto her hood and she had a panic attack.

'My hands were shaking and sweating so bad,' she said. 'I had no rational thought of what to do, except that if I didn't flee I was going to die.'

She said she eventually knew she had to turn herself in, so she told her husband and they sat down with their children and told them what had happened. She then went to her school and quit, before heading to speak to police.

'I would trade places in a second if I could,' she said of the little boy, WFAA reported. 'I have wanted to trade places and him be okay.'

Before the jury announced its verdict on Thursday, she had already pleaded guilty to one felony, Failure to Stop and Render Aid. 

The defense had argued that the prosecution failed to prove that Lowe had 'conscious intent' to run the light, and argued she be found guilty of the lesser charge of criminally negligent homicide, which is punishable by up to 180 days in state jail. 

'Did she panic? Did she freak out? Was she scared?' defense attorney Lee Bright asked jurors. 'I'd bet all of the above, and she made a horrible choice' - but added she was not guilty of manslaughter. 

Evidence: Lowe returned home and told her husband that the damage to her car was caused by kids at the school where she taught. He fixed the damage and she eventually admitted the truth days later

But prosecutors said she had not been paying attention as she drove and then did not stop, adding: 'That's her conscious intent.' 

'A good person would have stopped,' prosecutor Danielle Uher told the court. 'A good person, had they panicked, would have gone back.'

The jury is scheduled to deliberate her punishment on Friday.
