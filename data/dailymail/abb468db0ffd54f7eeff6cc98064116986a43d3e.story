It was supposed to be a document warning about the dangerous rise of home-run labs making crystal meth but it had an inadvertent side effect - handing readers a how-to guide on making the compound it was trying to beat.

The Government Accountability Office, the 'investigative arm of the U.S. Congress' published a report on the drug including basic pictures showing how the mixture is made, Yahoo News reports

The report was trying to emphasize the ease of access to the dangerous substance and the burden addiction puts on society but in the wrong hands it shows the chemical construction of the compound and how it can be made from basic household goods.

Controversial report: The Congress report includes this illustration listing household products which can be used to make crystal meth

Meth labs: The report talks about the dangerous proliferation of small home run meth labs such as the one pictured but controversially details how the compound is made

It by no means encourages readers to 'cook' the drug - a potentially fatal process in itself and made famous in the hit TV series Breaking Bad.

But it has caused people to question whether the level of detail was necessary in such a report.

'Today, meth can be made by anyone using easily obtainable household goods and consumer products.' the report says.

'Meth cooks have used two primary processes known as the Nazi/Birch and Red P methods to make d-meth. In recent years, meth cooks have developed a variation of the Nazi/Birch method known as the One Pot or Shake and Bake method that produces meth in one step where ingredients are mixed together in a container such as a 2-liter plastic bottle'.

Deaths in 'Meth Labs' rose to 15,000 in 2010 up from 7,000 in 2007 according to the report.

Hit series: TV series Breaking Bad was famously about 'cooking' the compound of crystal meth. A recent government report has been criticized for offering a manual on how to make the drug

As it adds: 'These labs pose significant public safety and health risks and financial burdens to local communities and states where they are found. The toxic chemicals and solvents involved in meth manufacturing can result in fiery explosions and expose property and people, including children, to contaminates that are dangerous and costly to remove.'

It adds that most of the drug in the U.S. is made in Mexico but the rest comes from 'small toxic labs' in central U.S.

Breaking Bad famously follows a high school science teacher turned crystal meth 'cook'. It has won critical acclaim with seven Emmys awarded over its five seasons to date.
