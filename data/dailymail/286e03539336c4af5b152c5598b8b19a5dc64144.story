Carol Vorderman is undoubtedly one of Britain's queens of style reinvention.  

Since she first shot to fame in 1982 as a mathematical genius on the Channel 4 show Countdown aged 22, the star has had more hairstyles than David Beckham and every member of Take That combined. 

This week, she made her biggest leap to date though - turning her natural brunette locks blonde for the first time.

Carol Vordeman, 54, is one of Britain's queens of style reinvention. Since starting on Countdown in 1982 (right), she has had 22 different hair styles but 2015 is the first time she has ever gone blonde (pictured left yesterday)

While most women might have looked a little unsure at being papped after such a drastic transformation, Carol, 54, smiled confidently into the lens of the camera. 

She has a head-start on most of her sex though - over the last three decades, FEMAIL has counted at least 20 hairstyles on the television personality. 

From dodgy perms to dowdy unlayered long hair with a blunt fringe, Carol's early years as a celebrity were almost reliably frumpy.  

But in the late nineties, she started to find her follicule footing and edged into fashionable territory, first with her take on 'The Rachel,' then with a mumsy version of Victoria Beckham's styled crop. 

A lesson in toned highlights and layering beckoned a wave of longer cuts that framed her face properly and by 2010, Carol was becoming known for her glossy mane in a positive light. 

But after ticking off most of the styles in the magazines at the hair salon, it wasn't going to be long before she took the plunge and reached for the bleach, which has resulted in total success.

In celebration, FEMAIL has taken a look back at the hair journey that took Carol from hair hell to heaven:

The former Countdown star, known for her beauty and her brain in equal measure, certainly looked race day ready as she turned heads upon arriving at the exclusive hotel.

Although she's famous for her quick-thinking arithmetic ability, there was only one number Carol was interested in - the figure-hugging black dress she was wearing.

The showstopping frock made the most of the star's famous curves, while she added a sheepskin coat for added dramatic effect.

Carol went all out when it came to her coiffed hair, volumising her newly blonde locks into a stylish waves.

When it comes to keeping her figure in check, Carol - who was famously one of the first celebrities to boast about the virtues of detoxing - insists she's not overzealous when it comes to banning certain foods.

Speaking to MailOnline, she explained: ‘I’m no Gwyneth Paltrow, I’m not a macrobiotic goddess by any stretch of the imagination as my friends will tell you. But I think I’ve got the balance right and I think that’s all we can do.

‘Your overall health is terrifically important and I try to remember that. I do like to do a two or three day fasts from time to time after recent research revealed the benefits it has to your system.

‘I take a lot of vitamin supplements and I drink proper juices – not the ones from a carton box.

‘I have eaten at least one avocado a day for as many days in the week as I can. And a bag of salad each day for as many years as I can remember.'
