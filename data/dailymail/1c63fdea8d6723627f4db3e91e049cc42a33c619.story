Liverpool trained at Melwood ahead of their Premier League showdown with Manchester City and the imminent arrival of Mario Balotelli.

Daniel Sturridge and Raheem Sterling were on target for Liverpool in their opening day victory against Southampton and will be hoping for more of the same against Manchester City.

The Premier League champions welcome the runners up to the Etihad on Monday night and Brendan Rodgers will be hoping his side can strike an early blow in the title race.

Balotelli won't be able to face his old club on Monday night but Brendan Rodgers insists his team are confident ahead of the game.

Rodgers said: 'I think the atmosphere and the ambience around the team is very, very good.

'It's been a key marker for us. When people look at the team, as well as the qualities, our team spirit is very strong, and it is something that got us through the game last weekend - that character, resilience and spirit.

'Maybe early on you didn't really see that, but I think you see that now in the team - that if we are not playing so well, we still want to fight and work.

'You do that when the team is close and the squad is close. Ultimately that will get you results.'
