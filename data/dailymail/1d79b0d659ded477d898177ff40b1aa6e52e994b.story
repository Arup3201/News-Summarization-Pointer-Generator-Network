A 21-year-old woman has been arrested by counter terror police at Luton Airport after landing on a flight from Istanbul. 

The woman, a British national, remains in the custody of Scotland Yard officers after being detained this morning. 

Her arrest comes days after three teenage boys were stopped by police as they tried to enter Syria from the Turkish capital. 

A 21-year-old woman was arrested at Luton Airport this morning as she landed on a flight from Istanbul 

'This morning at 11.15am officers from the Counter Terrorism Unit SO15 arrested a 21-year-old woman at Luton Airport on suspicion of preparation of acts of terrorism under section 5 of the terrorism act,' a Scotland Yard spokesman said. 

'The woman, a British national, was arrested as she entered the UK having landed on a flight from Istanbul. She is currently in custody.' 

It is not clear whether the woman had been in Syria before leaving Turkey. 

Earlier this week three teenage boys were stopped as they tried to join jihadis in the war-ravaged country. 

The youngsters, described as 'naive' sixth form students, were caught by officials when their parents phoned police to report concerns. 

They were put on a flight back to London last week and questioned by counter terrorism police. 

Three London schoolgirls have also fled the UK to join extremists in the Middle East. 

Shamima Begum, 15, Kadiza Sultana, 16, and 15-year-old Amira Abase were captured on CCTV boarding a 17-hour bus to the Syrian border from Istanbul.
