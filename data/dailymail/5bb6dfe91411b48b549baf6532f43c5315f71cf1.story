A drunken dog owner allegedly pinned a mother down to stop her rescuing her daughter as the six-year-old's face was bitten and torn by his Staffordshire bull terrier.

Instead of preventing his dog Bruno attacking Demi Baines, Philip Rhodes leapt on her mother Karen to pull her to the ground and stop her dragging his dog away, a court heard.

Jurors were told the 70-year-old then lay on top of Miss Baines as Demi was being savaged and drunkenly slurred to the dog: 'Get off her, get off her.'

When police arrived, Rhodes was allegedly so drunk that he struggled to stand. Questioned by officers, he said: 'Are you nailing me to a cross? That's what they did to Jesus.'

The Christmas Day attack outside Rhodes's home in Hyde, Greater Manchester, last year almost severed Demi's bottom lip and left her with wounds to her arm and back.

She needed emergency surgery and will be scarred for life.

At Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester, Miss Baines wept when she recalled her helplessness as the dog savaged Demi at 6pm while they walked home from a party.

She said: 'Philip was outside his property. He appeared to be drunk. He was slurring and staggering. The dog came out from a field. It wasn't on a lead. The dog ran in front of us and I put my hand down and it licked the tip of my finger then all of a sudden it attacked my daughter's face.

'I thought it was going to jump up and lick her face but it was when I heard the growl I realised it was attacking her.

'It jumped on her chest and she stepped back because it knocked her. She was standing up for a while – it felt like forever – then after a few seconds it had her on the floor. It was on her face and I knew it was attacking her.'

Miss Baines, 36, said she tried to wrestle the dog off her daughter before Rhodes stopped her.

'He jumped in and he got me on the floor,' she told the court. 'I was trying to get it to bite me and come to me rather than my daughter, then he jumped on me.

'I was underneath him and couldn't get up. I panicked and was kicking and screaming and he wouldn't let me up. He was slurring, 'Get off her, get off her'. I was scared the dog would kill her. It would have torn her apart.

'He kept grabbing me by my arms every time I went to grab the dog. I was trying to grab the dog by the collar and eventually got on my feet and shouted to my daughter who had managed to run off.

'Her lip was just hanging off. I felt like that dog was going to kill my little girl.

'He jumped on me and there was nothing I could do.'

Alison Heyworth, prosecuting, said: 'This was a frenzied attack and Miss Baines was unable to assist her daughter because she was struggling with the defendant who had her on the ground.

'Eventually Demi was released by the dog and ran away. Miss Baines kept trying to grab it because she was worried it would chase her daughter but was still prevented by the defendant who was holding on to her.'

Miss Heyworth added: 'The child was terribly injured. Her mouth had been severed completely in parts and she had a hole in her left arm and lower back.

'This was a horrific and terrifying attack by this defendant's dog on a child and the actions by this defendant prevented her mother from helping her.'

Rhodes denies assault and being the owner of a dog which has caused injury while dangerously out of control.

The trial continues.
