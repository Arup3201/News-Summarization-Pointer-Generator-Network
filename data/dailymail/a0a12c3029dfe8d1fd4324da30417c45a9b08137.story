He's known to millions of fans worldwide as Lord Eddard Stark - the doomed nobleman who loses his head to the deadly politics of hit fantasy series Game of Thrones.

But actor Sean Bean - also famous for appearances in the Lord of the Rings and Sharpe - has found himself caught up in a real-life turf war over plans to expand £4million his North London home.

The 55-year-old star, originally from Sheffield, today lost the latest round of his bid to build an open-air terrace on top of his four-bedroom house in Belsize Park.

Row: Sean Bean is battling neighbours with plans for a leafy terrace on the roof of his £4million London home

Views: Looking from the existing flat roof 
northwards over the ground floor (top and bottom left), and looking from
 the existing flat roof east (top and bottom right). Planning inspector David Barnes visited the site and said that he could see into neighbouring properties from the roof

His plans were shot down by planning officials in 2012 after neighbours complained that the terrace would give Mr Bean and his visitors a clear view into their bedrooms.

And the authorities at Camden Council have again sided with the neighbouring families by rejecting an appeal made by the actor.

Planning inspector David Barnes turned down the plan, saying that he could clearly see one of Mr Bean's neighbours through a patio window when he made a site visit.

The inspector said in his report, that while the roof terrace's design was not 'unduly intrusive or prominent', it would cause 'unacceptable harm' to neighbours.

One opponent, who lodged an official 
objection to the council, wrote: ‘Terrace very intrusive and prominently 
sited and highly visible from all round.’

Plans
 show a second-floor flat roof which Mr Bean wants to turn into a 
terrace and then screen with a mixture of olive, bay and laurel trees 
and a glass wall, with double doors leading into a bedroom.

The actor's architect, David Mercer, had
 said in the application that the terrace would not 'result in 
overlooking, loss of daylight or amenity to adjoining properties'.

Famed: The actor, pictured in ITV drama Sharpe, has been trying to force through the terrace plans since 2012

As it stands: A view from the flat roof looking south towards existing access from dormer windows

Desirable neighbourhood: Mr Bean, who bought his four-bedroom home in 1998, launched an appeal against the latest refusal on March 13

Mr Bean's team had also argued that the terrace would have been partly concealed behind a 6ft privacy screen.

The street is in a conservation zone and it is harder than usual to obtain planning consent.

The actor, who has been married four times, bought his elegant four-bedroom home 15 years ago.

At the time, he was married to one of his ex-wives, Abigail Cruttenden. The pair divorced in 2000. He is understood to have paid £1.5million for the property.

Mr Bean's publicists declined to comment.
