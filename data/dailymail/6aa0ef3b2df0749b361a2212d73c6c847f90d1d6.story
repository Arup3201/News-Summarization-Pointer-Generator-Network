The huge difference in wages between Premier League and Football League bosses has been revealed in a new report by the League Managers Association.

The average yearly wage of a League Two manager is £50,000 - £25,000 less than bosses in the division above.

But both salaries pale in comparison with the average wage in the top flight, which currently stands at a whopping £3million a year with Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho the Premier League's top earner on £8.37m-a-year.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho is the best-paid boss in the Premier League, earning £8.37m-a-year

League Two managers like Shrewsbury's Micky Mellon earn an average of £50,000 a year in the fourth tier

1. Jose Mourinho, Chelsea, £8.37m

2. Louis van Gaal, Manchester United, £7m

3. Arsene Wenger, Arsenal, £6.89m

4. Manuel Pellegrini, Manchester City, £3.47m

5. Brendan Rodgers, Liverpool, £3.25m 

Unsurprisingly the most lucrative salaries in the top flight belong to those in charge of the league's biggest clubs, with Manchester United's Louis van Gaal, Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini and Liverpool chief Brendan Rodgers completing the top five.

The LMA's research, which has been complied by Dr Sue Bridgewater of Liverpool University, also found that just 4.4 per cent of managers appointed since the 1992-93 season are black.

Carlisle boss Keith Curle and Huddersfield manager Chris Powell are the only black managers currently employed in the Football League, while there are none in the Premier League. 

Those figures compare unfavourably to players, with around 25 per cent of those in the Football League being black.
