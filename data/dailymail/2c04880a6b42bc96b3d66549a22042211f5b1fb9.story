Children have been warned not to venture outside as Shanghai's hazardous smog levels reach crisis point.

Authorities in China's financial hub also ordered a halt to construction work as the city suffers one of its worst bouts of air pollution in history.

The dense and dangerous smog - which reached more than 24 times the World Health Organisation's safe limit - caused visibility in China's most populated city to fall to just a few dozen metres, obscuring its spectacular skyline.

Authorities say the city's 
concentration of tiny, harmful PM 2.5 particles was 602.5 micrograms per
cubic metre early Friday afternoon, an extremely hazardous level.

That compares with the World Health Organization's safety guideline of 25 micrograms.

The
Shanghai environmental authority today even took the drastic move of 
lowering air pollution standards in an attempt to reduce the number of 
alerts being issued.

Alerts had previously been activated when the concentration of PM2.5 reached 75 micrograms per cubic metre.

Shanghai weather authorities could soon be given the all clear to use cloud seeding to generate rain.

The aim is the showers will to purge the atmosphere of dangerous particles.

It is part of the government's plan to invest 1.7 trillion yuan ($277 billion) in tackling air pollution.

The technique involves firing rockets carrying a payload of silver iodide particles into the clouds, according to New Scientist.

Ice crystals then form from super-cooled liquid water in the clouds, using the particles as nucleation points onto which the hazardous air particles latch and fall to earth.

But now the warning will be triggered by Shanghai's Environmental Protection Bureau when the dangerous particle concentration hits 115 micrograms per cubic meter, according to a report by the China Daily.

Experts
blame Shanghai's pollution on coal emissions in the region combined 
with weather patterns that have left the city's air stagnant.

The
issue of air quality has now become a serious concern for China's 
leadership as it plays into popular resentment over political privilege 
and rising inequality in the world's second-largest economy.

Health dangers from the severe pollution are also becoming more apparent.

Smog
in China’s most populated city is being blamed for a fertility crisis 
as the incidence of low sperm counts among its men reaches record 
levels.

Doctors in financial capital 
Shanghai say air and water pollution is a ‘major culprit’ for the city’s
predicament and warn that action needs to be taken urgently.

‘If we don’t protect the environment now, mankind will face a worsening infertility predicament,’ Dr Li Zheng, a sperm expert at the city’s Renji Hospital told the Shanghai Morning Post.

Only a third of the semen at Shanghai's main sperm bank, run by Dr Li, currently meets World Health Organisation standards. And smog levels are rising.

A 2012 study, coordinated by Dr Li, 
concluded that over the last ten years, worsening environmental 
conditions were keeping pace with the falling quality of sperm and 
aspermia, a condition that causes men to produce no semen at all. 

A
year ago, China's infertility rate stood at 12.5 per cent of people of 
childbearing age, according to China state news agency Xinhua. Twenty 
years ago it was just three per cent.
