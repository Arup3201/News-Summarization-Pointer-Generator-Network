A year has elapsed since a photograph of Oliver Giroud in his underpants triggered questions about his long-term future at Arsenal. 

In that time, there has been a Wembley triumph, a World Cup tournament, a broken ankle, a new £80,000-a-week contract and, on Sunday, two goals against Middlesbrough as the FA Cup holders eased into the quarter-finals.

Suddenly it is hard to imagine Arsenal without Giroud’s towering presence, the focal point for all the creative forces who swirl around him.

Arsene Wenger applauded the France striker for his progress since he arrived from Montpellier.

‘He understands now what top-level football demands,’ said Wenger. ‘He has improved on his mobility and his technical quality and, of course, his body is very strong and he uses it well.’

Giroud flirted with a return to France after revelations that he invited a model into the team hotel on the eve of a game last February. He was then dropped for the Champions League game against Bayern Munich in favour of Yaya Sanogo. But Giroud celebrated the anniversary of his indiscretion by proving his mind is firmly on his game these days.

He proved to be the difference in what might have been an awkward FA Cup fifth-round tie, scoring two wonderful goals inside 135 first-half seconds. Middlesbrough never recovered.

The first was a clinical finale to a long period of possession in which every Arsenal player touched the ball, starting with a roll-out from goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny to Brazilian centre half Gabriel, who was making his debut. This passage of play wound up on the left wing, where Kieran Gibbs whipped over a low cross which Giroud was first to reach, thumping his effort close to the goalkeeper but with enough power to beat Tomas Mejias.

The second was a brilliant piece of swift thinking from Alexis Sanchez, who took a quick corner and supplied the perfect cross. Giroud was the only other player alive to the opportunity and he converted with a fabulous volley, swept past Mejias with his left boot.

Wenger said: ‘It was a consequence of intelligence and technique from two players who responded quickly to a situation.’

With it, Giroud moved into double figures, a healthy goal return for a campaign in which he has missed three months after breaking an ankle in August.

The FA Cup sixth-round draw will be made at 7.35pm on Monday, before kick-off in Preston's fifth-round tie with Man Utd.

1. Liverpool (Odds: 5/2)

2. Arsenal (13/8)

3. Aston Villa (16/1)

4. West Brom (10/1)

5. Bradford (66/1)

6. Blackburn (28/1)

7. Reading (33/1)

8. Preston (150/1) or Man Utd (3/1)

His goals also punched the fight from Aitor Karanka’s in-form Championship side. Boro may have beaten Barclays Premier League champions Manchester City in the previous round but they never had Arsenal in trouble.

The visitors seemed to accept their fate and focus on the quest for promotion. Five thousand headed back to Teesside singing their manager’s name, although he was less satisfied.

‘I am disappointed,’ said Karanka. ‘Everybody was expecting another game like we played against Liverpool or Manchester City and this is my biggest concern. We didn’t go out on to the pitch as we usually go.

‘The second half was better but in the first half I didn’t like anything. It is difficult to beat teams like Arsenal if we make mistakes like we made on the second goal. If you want to take something here, you have to be perfect, as we were at the Etihad Stadium.

‘The cups are finished for us. Now we must forget everything about them and work hard for two or three months if we want to play here next season.’

Szczesny barely had a save to make, returning to the team for FA Cup duty having lost his position as No 1 after errors at Southampton on New Year’s Day.

Wenger likes his back-up goalkeeper to play in the FA Cup, and this offers Szczesny a far better chance of wrapping his gloves around silverware than David Ospina.

All the Pole had to do to repel Boro was organise his area and make a routine save from Albert Adomah in the first half.

Another effort from Adomah flashed wide near the end and Kike headed against a post.

The pick of several fine saves from Boro’s Mejias came in the second half, when he produced a brilliant reaction to turn away a header from Sanchez.

Arsenal will hope for a home tie in Monday’s draw having won their last nine at the Emirates.

Having waited nine years to get his hands on a major trophy, Wenger is not going to release his grip on the FA Cup easily.
