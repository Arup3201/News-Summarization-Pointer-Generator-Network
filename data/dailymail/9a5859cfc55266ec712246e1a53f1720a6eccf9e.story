Chris Eubank Jnr has landed an immediate world-title shot despite losing his high-profile fight with Billy Joe Saunders in November.

The 25-year-old will fight Russia’s interim WBA world middleweight champion Dmitry Chudinov at the O2 Arena on February 28, as chief support to Tyson Fury’s bout with Christian Hammer.

It’s a huge opportunity for Eubank Jnr, who showed raw talent but failed to match his camp’s hype in losing a split decision to Saunders last month.

If successful, it is likely Eubank Jnr will push for a unification fight against Saunders or newly-crowned WBO champion Andy Lee, with the latter duo expected to meet in the spring.

The interim belt is secondary to the main title, which is held by Gennady Golovkin. 

Promoter Frank Warren has also confirmed Paul Butler will fight IBF world super-flyweight champion Zolani Tete on March 6 in Liverpool.

Warren said: ‘It’s been a busy Christmas period, but I’m delighted to secure world title fights for Chris and Paul early in the new year which is fantastic news for them.

If Eubank Jnr beats Chudinov, he'll likely push for a unification fight against Saunders, should he beat newly-crowned WBO champion Andy Lee in an expected spring encounter

'For Chris, it was a close fight against Billy and the loss to a big rival would have been hard to take, but he now has a great opportunity to go straight back into the ring and claim a world championship belt and prove that he’s learnt from the loss and show that he’s the real thing.

‘I believe that Paul is a super talent and I’m especially pleased to deliver him a second and history making world title opportunity against Tete which should have happened in October.

‘He gets the chance now and I’m sure he’ll grab the opportunity with both hands. It’s a great start to the year and there is more big news to come shortly for Liam Smith and Derry Mathews on the Liverpool show.’
