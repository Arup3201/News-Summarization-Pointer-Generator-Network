Garry Monk has had a magical start to the Premier League season, wins against Manchester United, Burnley and West Brom putting his Swansea second in the table, behind Chelsea.

And Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport is suitably impressed, picking Monk as one of their four 'new wizards' managing in European football.

The Swansea boss has been super-imposed onto a picture of Harry Potter alongside Willy Sagnol of Bordeaux, Bayer Leverkusen manager Roger Schmidt, and Vitoria Guimaraes's Rui Vitoria.

Magic: Swansea manager Garry Monk is one of four young managers labelled 'the new wizards'

Great start: Monk's Swansea side have picked up maximum points from their first three league games

Sagnol's Bordeaux currently top Ligue 1, two points ahead of Paris Saint-Germain, while Vitoria Guimaraes, like Swansea, are second in their league having picked up maximum points.

In Germany Bayer Leverkusen are the only team with a 100 per cent record, topping the table after two games. 

'These coaches are the surprise of the season,' according to La Gazzetta, taking examples of coaches managing their first clubs or in the major leagues for the first time with immediate success.

However, the Italian paper is quick to point out that they unlikely to be victorious in the long-run at their current clubs, despite their strong starts. 

Firepower: Nathan Dyer, who has scored three goals already this season, nets against West Brom

Success: Wins against Manchester United, Burnley and West Brom have given Monk the perfect start
