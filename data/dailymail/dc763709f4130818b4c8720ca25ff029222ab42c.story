The U.S representative for Alaska alarmed students and teachers at a school assembly after making 'hurtful' and 'insensitive' comments about suicide days after a student killed himself.

While speaking at Wasilla High School yesterday, Don Young - the longest serving Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives - said people often committed suicide because they had a lack of support from friends and family.

The comments stunned his audience of about 120 English and government students as they were still mourning the loss of a student who died last Thursday.

U.S representative for Alaska Don Young has been accused of making 'hurtful' comments about suicide during a talk with students at Wasilla High Schooldays after a boy had killed himself

Principal Amy Spargo told the Alaska Dispatch News: 'When I heard 'a lack of support from family' and I heard 'a lack of support from friends,' I felt the oxygen go out of the room, but I gasped as well. 

'It just isn't true in these situations. It's just such a hurtful thing to say.'

She said the remarks were 'hurtful' and 'insensitive'. 

The encounter occurred after teacher Carla Swick asked Mr Young about Alaska's high suicide and domestic violence rates and what his office was doing to address it. 

Ms Spargo and Ms Swick say a friend of the victim, shouted at Young that the deceased, 'Had friends. He had support.'

And that he went on to say the cause of his death was depression, 'a mental illness'.

Ms Spargo said Mr Young replied, 'Well, what, do you just go to the doctor and get diagnosed with suicide?' 

The congressman is said to have gone on to use the words '***hole or 'smartass'.  

About 120 students attended the talk and question and answer session which was ended by school principal Amy Spargo after Mr Young made comments against same-sex marriage 

The politician's views on same-sex marriage also caused a stir when he compared to men getting married to bulls having sex. He was asked by junior student Zachary Grier why it was 'so bad in your eyes?'

Ms Spargo said Mr Young, 81, answered by saying: 'You can't have marriage with two men. What do you get with two bulls?'

Mr Young was then said to have said something about a lot of 'bullshazzle' or some word resembling the swear word.

The principal said: 'At that point I was heading for the microphone.

'It was time to be done.'  

Ms Spargo said she talked briefly with Mr Young on his way out and he asked her who the boy was that shouted at him. 

She said, when told it was a friend of the boy who died, Mr Young replied: 'That boy needs to learn some respect.'

Mr Young was also accused of using profanity and and telling stories not appropriate for a high-school audience.   

Mr Young's office later issued a statement about his talk at the school, saying he was 'serious and forthright' when discussing the issue of suicide.

His spokesman, Matt Shuckerow said: 'He discussed what he believes are leading causes of youth suicide in our state and shared some suggestions for helping family members and friends who are dealing with suicidal thoughts.

'In no way did Congressman Young mean to upset anyone with his well-intentioned message. In light of the tragic events affecting the Wasilla High School community, he should have taken a much more sensitive approach.'

The statement went on to say Mr Young had become frustrated by one student who had 'deprived their fellow classmates by talking throughout the presentation'.

But the congressman, the statement said, had expressed 'his regret for any offence taken during the honest and spirited discussion' to the school. 

Ms Spargo was meeting with staff today to discuss the incident, and was unsure if she would take the matter further.
