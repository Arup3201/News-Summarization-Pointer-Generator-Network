The challenge was to boldly send a burger and chips where no fast food had gone before.

And that's what two fast-food entrepreneurs managed to achieve. 

Andy Shovel and Pete Sharman, the proprietors of London-based burger outlet Chosen Bun, decided to attempt the outlandish challenge for a third time two weeks ago.

Take-off: Peter Sharman loads the  burger and chips onto their flying device

First mission: The business partners claimed they were sending the first burger and chips into space

The business partners had made previous attempts to complete the stunt In June and August but their recording equipment broke and both trips were unsuccessful.

The pair sent the burger and chips meal 112,000ft up and incredibly the video has now been viewed almost 89,000 times.

Writing about their reason for sending a burger and chips into space the owners of Chosen Bun wrote in the video description: 'We sent a burger and chips to space. For no good reason.'

Science: The two men have a background in physics and they spent £2,000 on the project

The Chosen Bun! Peter Sharman described the burger as being cold after it landed following the stunt

Mr Shovel and Mr Sharman needed a burger, chips, a balloon the size of a two-bedroom house, lots of helium, a GPS transponder, hand-warmers, a camera, a parachute, duck-tape and some string in order to send the fast food skywards. 

Speaking on the video Mr Shovel said the mission was reborn and they were eager to finally achieve their goal.

The footage was captured on a GoPro camera and a loud bang is heard after two minutes and 50 seconds when the balloon expanded to eight metres in height. 

A message then appears on-screen which states that  the burger was found 32 miles from the launch site. 

One internet user on Reddit humorously labelled the burger and chips as Unidentified Frying Objects.
