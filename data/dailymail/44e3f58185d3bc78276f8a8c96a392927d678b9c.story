It was the eighth inning of the Mets-Angels game in Anaheim on Friday night when Curtis Granderson caught a ball near the wall.

Just as he was about to throw the ball back to the infield, an Angels fan reached over and touched his back.

Granderson immediately turned and confronted the fan, who was then quickly escorted out by security.

What the? New York Mets rightfielder Curtis Granderson was startled during a game on Friday night after a fan reached over the railing and touched him

Out of the blue: Curtis Granderson was surprised when a fan reached over the fence and touched him on the back

¿I was startled, shocked,¿ the Mets right fielder said. ¿It was the first time it¿s ever happened to me.¿

Just before Granderson threw the ball into the infield, a fan touched him on the shoulder. Granderson appeared angry as he pointed out the fan.

Granderson told New York Newsday that he doesn’t mind if fans shout at him, just so long as they keep their hands off.

After making the catch and with the ball still in his hands, Granderson turned around to see who had touched him

'He touched me, then I turned around and he’s like, ‘I didn’t mean to.’ I said, ‘Hey, just don’t touch me.’ So that was it. Say whatever you want to say, boo, cheer, clap, cheer for your team, cheer for the other team. But just don’t physically touch players.'

Security personnel escorted the fan out of the ballpark shortly after the incident.

'I got touched while in play,' Granderson said. 'I told him not to touch me and that was it.'

Granderson admitted he was startled. He had never been through a similar experience.

What'd I do? The fan, who was not identified, was marched out of the stadium by security after the incident

During the next half inning, Granderson was approached by Anahiem team security about the incident

Getting a talking-to: Stadium security on the field hurried over to Granderson and security in the stands immediately rushed to the section. The fan was escorted out

'You never know what's going to go on," said Granderson, who considered the incident a safety issue.

'The first thing that was asked to me by the security here was 'Are you OK? Did anything happen?' I was like yeah, everything's fine. But just the fact that I got touched during the act of the game, while things were going on, is obviously something to always be concerned about.'

Granderson said he would not file a complaint against the fan and the issue was finished as far as he was concerned. Mets manager Terry Collins said he did not see the incident.
