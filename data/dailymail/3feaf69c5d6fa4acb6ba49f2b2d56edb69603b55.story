The age of the ‘selfie’ is well and truly upon us, but until now taking your own photo has required you to, well, take your own photo.

Enter SELFIE, the ‘Self Enhancing Live Feed Image Engine’ mirror that takes your picture when you smile at it.

Say cheese! The SELFIE mirror takes your photo when you smile at it for two seconds and then crafts a tweet including your photo for you

The brains behind the product is American digital agency iStrategyLabs.

They devised the mirror as a fun and easy way to take selfies without the signature arm's length-style shot.

And they say the mirror could be used in a variety of environments, from businesses to bars.

‘We had to experiment with the platform a little bit to get it working,’ iStrategyLabs Chief Marketing Officer DJ Saul tells MailOnline.

‘We had some funny things like it would locate a smile on the side of your head, so we played around until we were comfortable.

Behind the mirror is a Mac mini computer

This powers a piece of freely available facial recognition software called Open CV.

A webcam then looks outwards through the two-way mirror.

When you smile, LEDs controlled by Arduiono light up vertically on the mirror.

After two seconds the LEDs ‘flash’ white and it snaps your photo

The mirror then creates a tweet with the image for you.

Several
 people can also get in the shot, although it can’t recreate a photo 
with as many as people as the famous Oscar selfie just yet.

‘We also considered photos being 
triggered by a wink, but we went with a smile as it fit with the 
narrative a bit more for a smiling selfie.’

At the moment the company doesn’t have plans to make it commercially available, although they are considering supplying it to businesses.

But they say the 'really awesome potential' would be to mass produce it for hundreds of users.

‘It could absolutely also be deployed in bars and things,’ Saul continues.

‘The core experience is not that different from a photobooth really.

‘What makes this special is all you see as a user is the mirror itself.

‘The hands-free selfie is a tagline we’re playing around with.

‘You literally just stare into it and smile.’
