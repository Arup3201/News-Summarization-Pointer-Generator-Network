Comedian Russell Brand today gave evidence about his battle with addiction to MPs reviewing the Government's drugs policy in his own unique style.

The 36-year-old arrived for the select committee hearing at Portcullis House in Westminster wearing a sleeveless t-shirt that showed off his heavily-tattooed arm, copious jewellery, cowboy boots and hat, and a long trenchcoat.

His testimony was no less colourful as he addressed MPs as 'mate' and described how he became addicted to drugs because of emotional and psychological difficulties, adding 'it was rough'.

Centre of attention: Comedian Russell Brand gives evidence about this own battle with addiction to MPs reviewing the Government's drugs policy in his own inimitable style today

Colourful: Brand, sat next to detox centre boss Chip Somers, told the hearing at Portcullis House in Westminster how he became addicted to drugs because of emotional and psychological difficulties

Flamboyant: Brand said society needs to change the way it views addicts

Friend: Brand said singer Amy Winehouse's death last year should become a 'force for change and good policy'

When 
pushed for time by chairman Keith Vaz near the end of the lively and energetic 
30-minute hearing, Brand replied: 'Time is infinite. We 
can’t run out of time.

'Who’s next? Theresa May? She may not turn up. Ask her if she knows what day it is.'

And when Labour MP David Winnick told Brand 
the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee was not a variety show, Brand 
replied: 'You’re providing a little bit of variety though, making it 
more like Dad’s Army.'

The flamboyant film star said addiction should be treated as a health issue rather than a criminal matter.

He
called for 'abstinence-based recovery' as he gave evidence about his 
own battle with addiction to MPs reviewing the Government’s drugs 
policy.

And he said the death of Amy Winehouse must not be 'in vain' and should prompt a major overhaul of drugs policies.

Winehouse’s death last year should become a 'force for change and good policy', he added.

He told the committee: 'Amy’s life should not have been in vain. It can be a catalyst and force change and good policy in this country.'

Brand has given frank accounts of his battle to overcome drug addiction and has said society needs to change the way it views addicts.

Brand said he was not calling for 'a free-for-all where everyone goes around taking drugs'.

'Addicts will always be able to get drugs', he said, 'whether they are illegal or not.'

However, he added he was not qualified to talk about legalisation.

Instead, he said addiction should be treated as an illness and society should recognise that addicts, with the proper help, can become active and useful members.

He said society should not 'discard people, write them off on methadone and leave them on the sidelines'.

Instead, society should 'neutralise the toxic social threat they pose as criminals'.

Asked if there should be a carrot and stick approach, he said it should be more about 'love and compassion'.

Speaking rapidly and addressing 
committee members by their first names, Brand dismissed suggestions that
addicts cared where their drugs came from or the consequences of their 
production.

'I don’t think they’re going to be affected by that because they’re normally on drugs,' he said.

Asked about the role of celebrities, he said: 'Who cares about bloody celebrities?'

Brand said that, instead, he wanted to offer people 'truth and authenticity'.

Chip
Somers, chief executive of the detox centre Focus 12, where Brand 
sought help with drug dependency, said: 'Just to park people on 
methadone for four to seven years is criminal.'

Abstinence was an 'admirable aim for everybody', he said, but he admitted that not everyone would achieve it.

'I don’t think methadone is a good thing.'

He added he thought many methadone users were also using other drugs.

Both Brand and Somers said the number of people criminalised for possession should be reduced.

Brand said he would back the decriminalisation of drugs, adding there was 'a degree of cowardice and wilful ignorance around this condition'

Brand
said he would back decriminalisation of drugs, adding there was 'a 
degree of cowardice and wilful ignorance around this condition'.

'I’m not a legal expert. I’m saying 
that, to a drug addict, the legal aspect is irrelevant,' he said. 'If 
you need to get drugs, you will.

'The criminal and legal status, I think, sends the wrong message.

'Being arrested isn’t a lesson, it’s just an administrative blip.'

He added that he was not telling people not to take drugs if it was causing no harm, but said he wanted to see more funding for abstinence-based recovery.

Members of the public packed the hearing room to hear Brand’s evidence.
