QPR manager Harry Redknapp is keen to pair new signing Rio Ferdinand with Steven Caulker at centre-back after having a bid for the Cardiff City defender accepted.

Ferdinand completed his free transfer to Rangers on Thursday and Redknapp confirmed that the Loftus Road outfit had agreed a fee with Cardiff for Caulker. 

It is believed a bid in the region of £8million has been accepted for the England international.

Pen to paper: Caulker has been at Cardiff for almost a year after signing at the end of July 2013

Redknapp said he was confident the 22-year-old would become a better player alongside Ferdinand.

'We've agreed a fee for Steven Caulker, who I like very much,' he told Sky Sports News.

'I had him at Tottenham as a player and he's done very well.

'I think for him to come and play with Rio would be a great experience for him.

'I'm looking to play with three central defenders this year. So (there are) those two and then I've got Richard Dunne, Nedum Onuoha, Clint Hill, I've got real good defenders here.

'I think for Steven Caulker to come in and be part of it with those experienced players will be great for him.

'I think Rio will be a big influence on him. I think for Steven it will be the best education he could ever have in his life to play with Rio.'

Caulker moved to Cardiff last summer for a then club-record fee from Tottenham Hotspur.
