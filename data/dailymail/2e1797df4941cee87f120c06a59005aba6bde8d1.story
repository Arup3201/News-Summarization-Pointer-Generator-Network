If you assumed the dirty grease from your Sunday roast was useless, think again - it could soon be making you a cup of tea.

Scientists are on a mission to conquer the giant 'fatbergs' clogging Britain's sewers by generating electricity from used cooking oil.

So-called 'fat vats' - resembling a kitchen-top compost bin - have been handed out to residents of Bradford, West Yorkshire, in a trial which would be rolled out to thousands of homes.

Fancy a cuppa? A water firm hopes these 'fatbergs' in the sewers of Bradford, West Yorkshire, will soon be a thing of the past. A five-litre 'fat vat' filled by just one house would provide enough power for 1,250 cups of tea

Appetising: The water firm released revolting photos of its blocked sewers to stop people pouring oil away

The 85 households will pour their leftover cooking oil, fat and grease into the five-litre plastic tubs which will be collected fortnightly by their local water firm.

Yorkshire Water will then take the samples to a centre near Leeds run by the renewable energy firm called Living Fuels, where they will be converted into bio-electricity.

It is claimed 1,000 litres of oil - weighing about a tonne - would generate enough electricity to power an average home for a year.

That is enough to make 250,000 cups of tea or power a microwave for 3,000 hours - the equivalent of 125 days' continual use.

Just one of the household vats would provide enough energy to boil the kettle 1,250 times.

The system works by pumping oil into 'settling tanks', where it is left for two to five weeks to let impurities settle to the bottom where they can be removed.

Blockage: The sewers of Bradford Moor, where the trial is taking place, have been obstructed 80 times

Pipe: Water firms warn even liquid fat like cooking oil can solidify and cause problems down the drain

The lighter, purer oil is then filtered and used in combined heat and power stations, where it produces heat for homes and electricity which can be used on the National Grid.

It comes after warnings by water engineers that our love of fatty food is causing dangerous blockages in Britain's sewers.

Last summer a 15-ton fatberg the size of a bus was found in sewers under Kingston, south west London, after resident complained they couldn't flush their toilets.

The revolting mass of congealed fat and wet wipes took three weeks to remove and was said to be days from forcing raw sewage out of manhole covers across Kingston.

Water firms have warned that even liquid fat like cooking oil can solidify and cause problems once it goes down the drain.

A Yorkshire Water spokesman said 110,000 tonnes of used 
cooking oil is thrown away by British households every year, enough to provide carbon-neutral power to 110,000 homes.

The company spent Â£2.3million improving the region's sewers last year to modernise them and prevent blockages.

The scheme is being rolled out in 85 homes in co-ordination with the Karmand Community Centre in Bradford Moor.

The area has been hit particularly badly by sewer blockages with 80 in the last year.

The water firm said the main cause was identified as cooking oils being poured down people's sinks, which later solidify in sewers.

Yorkshire Water technician Duncan Woodhead said: 'A lot of people don't realise the damage this can do because these liquids solidify when they get down to the sewers and that can cause blockages.

'We are all now looking forward to experiencing the benefits that this new trial will be.'
