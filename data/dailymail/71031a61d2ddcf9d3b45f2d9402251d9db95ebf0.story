Pastor Jehoshaphat Air Wibowo and his funeral director Suhendra Putro stood in the tiny, hot room at the Javanese Christian church yesterday in Cilicap, making some of the final preparations for the looming executions of Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran. 

With airforce jets on standby and their latest court appeal rejected, Chan and Sukumaran moved one step closer to being flown from their jail cell in Bali, 900 kilometres to the west, to this port town, which supplies Nusa Kambangan, also known as Death Island, where they will be shot to death.

Cilacap appears more than ready. Since the first coffins arrived last week for the expected executions of 11 convicts on death row for drug offences, Mr Putro has brought in another six.

Other equipment recently arrived are six large wooden crosses, six pillows, six satin covers and six sets of cross-shaped coffin nails, individually bagged the way that furniture stores, such as Ikea, package their screws.

With airforce jets on standby and a failed court appeal it seems that Australians Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran are one step closer to being flown from their Bali jail cell 900km west to Cilacap and taken to the island to be shot

The bill (right) that Mr Putro had just paid for included the cost of the cross-shaped coffin nails (left)

Mr Putro said a jumbo-sized coffin was ordered for a bigger person such as Sukumaran

'We have several sized coffins. Standard or medium size is for most people and jumbo size is for bigger people,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'Foreigners are bigger than Indonesians. Maybe Australians. Chan is not big. Mr Sukumaran, he is big, yes?'

The jumbo-sized coffin among Mr Putro's stack at the church is at two metres long - no longer than the medium-sized - but with a considerably wider girth, around 90 centimetres wide rather than about 75 centimetres.

'It is not the stomach,' Mr Putro said, crossing his arms to show how a body was placed in a coffin, 'It is the shoulders.'

He paid about six million Rupiah - around $600 Australian dollars - for the coffins and funeral items from a firm in Yokyakarta, which is a four-hour drive from Cilacap along a traffic choked highway.

The coffins and their corresponding crosses, covers and pillows, arrived in the past few days.

The jumbo coffin is two metres long - the same as the medium-sized boxes - but with a considerably wider girth, around 90cm wide rather than about 75cm

With up to 11 murderers and drug traffickers including Chan (right) and Sukumaran (left) scheduled for execution on Nusakambangan soon, Mr Putro might be two coffins short

Mr Putro bought in another six coffins along with six large wooden crosses, six pillows, six satin covers and six sets of cross-shaped coffin nails, individually bagged the way that furniture stores package their screws

A receipt showed six 'puti' or coffins for 4.05 million Rupiah ($401.81), six 'salib' or crosses for 420,000 Rupiah ($41.67), six 'slove' or pillows for 180,000 Rupiah ($17.86), six ' tule' or covers at 480,000 Rupiah ($47.64), plus ' kirim' or transport at 750,000 Rupiah ($74.44) and a 70,000 Rupiah ($6.95) fee for a man to help lift the coffins.

With up to 11 murderers and drug traffickers including Chan and Sukumaran scheduled for execution on Nusa Kambangan soon, Mr Putro worries he might be two coffins short.

Mr Putro, who has been a mortician since 1992 and considers his profession 'a calling from God' said he did not know whether he would need medium or jumbo-sized because 'the police haven't told me yet'.

But there was no time to order in any more of the specially made white ruched satin style he currently had.

'They will be plain, no material because it is an emergency order,' he said.

Meanwhile he, his assistant Mr Sulamin and Paster Wibowo are keeping the coffins in a hot, dry room with mothballs, so as to prevent mold or insects from damaging them.

The medium coffins weighed about 60kg and the jumbo size was about 70kg and if it rained on proceedings, the wooden structures absorbed about another 10kg in weight

Struggling to shift the caskets in the tiny crowded room with Mr Sulamin on one end and himself on the other, Mr Putro said each one weighed about 60kg, although the jumbo size was about 70kg and if it rained on proceedings, the wooden structures absorbed about another 10kg in weight.

He said he was on standby for the police to give him the word that the executions would go ahead.

'Then on the day, the ambulances will come, one for each, with the coffins labelled for each prisoner and the ambulances also named,' he said.

'Then I will go at 10pm to the island and wait for the executions. Afterwards the bodies are placed on tables and myself and my assistants go and prepare them for the coffins.

Mr Putro said he did not personally pray for the souls of the condemned prisoners: 'but I pray I can carry out a good and proper job.'

He said three of the five inmates exectuted on Nusakambangan Island on January 18 this year 'had smiles on their faces' when he has dressed their bodies.

Four Indonesian and five foreign prisoners apart from Chan and Sukumaran are listed for possible execution in this 'round'.

The Indonesians are multiple murderers Syofial aka Iyen Bin Anwar, Harun bin Ajis and Sargawi aka Ali Bin Sanusi and Zainal Abidim, who imported 58.7kg of cannabis.

The foreigners are Mary Jane Veloso, Filipina importer of 2.6kg of heroin, French ecstasy lab operator Serge Ataloui, Ghanian Martin Anderson who imported just 50g of heroin, Nigerian Raheem Agbaje Salami (5.3kg of heroin) and the mentally ill Brazilian inmate, Rodrigo Gularte, who has been on the island for most of the eight years since he imported heroin in surfboards.

Andrew Chan, 31, and Myuran Sukumaran, 33, were convicted in 2005 in relation to the 'Bali Nine' heroin importing ring of 8.3kg of the drug.

Pastor Wibowo said he would offer his help to give religious counsel to any of the men or women who were to be executed, but that he did not believe in it.

'I say only God has the right [to take someone's life] not the government,' he said.

There was no time to order in any more of the specially made white ruched satin style  so any extra coffins will be plain, because it is an 'emergency order'
