A frog with no croak and the world’s biggest lizard are among the top 10 reptiles and amphibians avoiding extinction with the help of zoos, a report has said.

The British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA) has published the list of reptile and amphibian species benefiting from conservation efforts by zoos in the UK and Ireland.

They include the axolotl, a critically endangered amphibian which retains its tadpole like appearance as an adult and has an extraordinary ability to regenerate limbs, and the golden mantella, a bright yellow frog which attracts a mate with clicks not croaks.

Lemur leaf frogs, a highly endangered species from Central America, are also being saved with the help of zoos

Also on the list is the Komodo dragon, with less than 1,000 left in the wild, and the mountain chicken, the world’s biggest frog which got its name as it is commonly hunted for food.

One of the most sought after reptiles in the illegal pet trade, the ploughshare tortoise, also makes the list as does a UK species, the sand lizard.

Dr Andrew Marshall, of BIAZA’s field programmes committee, said: 'Zoos are part of a global conservation community.

'Last year, BIAZA published a report of the top 10 mammals most reliant on zoos, which highlighted the work being done by zoos to help safeguard their future.

'This year, we have focused on 10 prevailing examples of reptiles and amphibians that zoos are working to save from extinction. The list includes some fantastic species, many of which are facing a dramatic decline and are in a desperate situation in the wild.'

TV presenter and naturalist Nick Baker, who is backing this year’s top 10 campaign to raise awareness of the species, said: 'Zoos and aquariums have a very important role in this whole thing - at the scariest level they are the Ark.

Populations of the orange tailed skink, which is native to north Africa, are also improving

Sand lizards, found throughout Europe, are threatened and carefully protected under UK law

Madagascar's native ploughshare tortoise is also benefiting from the zoos' 'ark' populations

'They are where the insurance populations of these animals can be looked after and understood and studied.'

He added: 'As much as BIAZA are very important in holding the ark population, they are also very important in being that interface between these animals and the public.'

He said zoos helped people appreciate species which might not have an instant appeal to the masses, as they are not furry, and were using money from visitors and applying it 'directly to try and give these creatures a happy ending'.
