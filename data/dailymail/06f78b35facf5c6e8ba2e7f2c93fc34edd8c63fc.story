The man who died after a shark attack in Byron Bay has been identified as British expat Paul Wilcox

Despite yesterday's fatal shark attack, a tanned 70-year-old man has braved the surf at Byron Bay's closed Main Beach, emerging from the water to declare the great white should not mess with him.

'I'm going to rip his head off!' keen ocean swimmer John Parkes told Daily Mail Australia on the beach on Wednesday morning. 'I'll tear his teeth out!'

Mr Parkes insisted on going for his morning dip on the same stretch of beach from where Englishman Paul Wilcox, 50, was killed by the shark.

Mr Wilcox's wife Victoria watched on from the beach in horror yesterday as rescuers attempted to revive her husband. All beaches in the area were closed for 24 hours following the attack.

It also emerged Mr Wilcox was wearing a dark wetsuit and flippers and may have been mistaken for a seal or a large turtle by the shark.

On Wednesday, Byron Bay local Mr Parkes, who wore red budgie smugglers, was adamant he would go for his daily swim, shark or no shark, despite the evident disapproval of other local ocean swimmers.

'No! Get on with it,' said Mr Parkes, who emerged from the surf only several hundred metres from a 'beach closed' sign. 'You just keeping going... you just have to keep going forward.'

Mr Parkes, who used to run local business Cossies by the Sea, was the only person Daily Mail Australia saw brave the surf on Wednesday morning.

Swimmers from the local group Stingrays said they disapproved of Mr Parkes's actions as it made the situation more difficult for surf lifesavers, who patrolled the Byron coast on jetskis.

Overnight it emerged that Mr Wilcox had joked about the danger of sharks with his family in the UK just 24 hours before he was fatally attacked.

Mr Wilcox swam in the sea near his property in Byron Bay every day but had never mentioned sharks until his final call home, his anguished parents told the Mail.

The businessman was on his regular one-kilometre swim when the large shark attacked, biting into his leg.

Mrs Wilcox, who was seen on the beach immediately after her husband was pulled to shore by Newcastle lawyer Mark Hickey, said she did not witness the attack

Despite the heartbreak of her husband's death, Mrs Wilcox said she wanted to stay in Byron Bay but could not go back to the house the couple shared together

A holidaymaker who spotted him in 
distress paddled frantically to his aid but Mr Wilcox bled to death in 
the water. His wife, Victoria, 50, is thought to have witnessed the 
drama from the shore.

Newcastle lawyer Mark Hickey jumped into the water to pull Mr Wilcox's body from the water

Lawyer
 Mark Hickey, 52, said the water had darkened so much with blood he 
initially thought he was looking at a patch of seaweed.

He jumped on his
 paddle-ski and sped towards Mr Wilcox some 40 yards away, in what 
police called ‘an extraordinary act of bravery’.

He
 said: ‘Then I 
realised he was in trouble and I had to make a decision - and that 
decision was to try to do what I could to help him. 

‘I didn’t think much about the shark – I just needed to help the 
man. The shark had been circling and came back to him and had another 
go. He needed someone to help him.

‘I grabbed him and got him back to the beach and tried CPR but it was too late.’

Mr
 Wilcox’s body was identified on the beach by his distraught wife of 26
 years, the Russian daughter of an eminent surgeon.

Mr Wilcox ran a a time management and 
communication skills company - through which he coached a number of high-profile company directors.

Mr Wilcox went out to Australia in 1986 for a six-month trip but stayed after meeting his wife. They married in 1989, pictured above

He went out to Australia in 1986 for a six 
month adventure holiday but loved the lifestyle so much he stayed.

He
 met his 50-year-old wife, a personal trainer who lived in Sydney, at a 
friend’s wedding in Australia.  The couple married in Sydney in 1989 but
 decided not to have children.

The couple had moved to Byron Bay, 480 miles north of Sydney in northern New South Wales, four years ago.

Mr
 Wilcox grew up in Coventry, and his parents separated when he was a 
child and both remarried.

Yesterday, his step-father Bryan Wilcox, 79, 
told how he and his wife urged him to be careful as they spoke on the 
phone from their home near Corwen, North Wales, earlier this week.

He 
said: ‘I told Paul to be careful of the sun.

He made a joke and said, “I
 always wear a wetsuit and I use a lot of sun lotion.” Then he said: 
“That’s not the problem, the sharks are more of a problem.”

Byron Bay's beaches will remain closed for at least the next 24 hours

I
 told him he must be joking. Then he started to laugh and said, “They 
are very very rare here – I’ve never seen one.” He had never referred to
 sharks before,’ Mr Wilcox said.

Marie
 Wilcox, 74, said her son  – who took her husband’s surname – had said 
he planned to go for a swim in the sea the following morning. She said: 
‘The last thing I said to him was: keep safe, I love you.’

Speaking
 of the couple, she said: ‘It was love at first sight, they adored each 
other. They had found their paradise in Australia.’

Mr
 Wilcox, a keen swimmer since his youth, was a member of Byron Bay 
swimming club, and was in the shallows on the eastern side of the  main 
beach when he was attacked.

A large shark was spotted off the coast of Byron Bay on Tuesday morning after the attack

The shark is believed to have bitten through his wetsuit on his upper right thigh.

‘It
 was a fatal bite with major blood loss. He probably died in the water 
because there was no blood loss on the beach,’ New South Wales Ambulance
 paramedic Andrew Chapman said.

Lifesavers who usually patrol the beach 
and check for sharks are not due to begin their summer duties until next
 week.

All the area’s 
beaches closed and helicopters were patrolling the coastline checking  
the shark had gone back out to sea. Police said that despite it being a 
protected species it would be shot if it returned.

Police officers stayed at the beach until around 2.30pm on Tuesday when the body was taken away

'It was so horrible': Witnesses have told how they were yelled at to get out of the water

A shark was spotted near where the surfer was attacked and witnesses said it was around two metres in size

The last fatal shark attack in Byron Bay was in 1993.

Mr
 Wilcox’s sister, Jane Richmond, a 54-year-old grammar school teacher, 
lives in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, with husband Paul, 56. The 
couple declined to comment last night.

Mr Wilcox’s 
birth father, Ignatius McCabe, 76, a retired licensee, still lives in 
Coventry with his second wife, Beryl, 81. The couple said they had last 
seen the managing director 30 years ago when he visited a pub that they 
were then running outside the city.

The man was thought to have been doing the popular ocean swim from the The Pass to Bryon Bay
