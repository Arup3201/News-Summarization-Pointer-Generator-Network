A 28-year-old mother was left with thinning locks and bald patches after one too many dye treatments.

Kellie Holloway, from Winchester, spent her youth bleaching and dyeing her hair so much, that it left her with a bald crown. 

'I must have dyed it about 300 times. Once I started it became addictive,' she revealed on Channel 4 show Bodyshockers.

Kellie, pictured after her hair started thinning, began to use styles that hid the bald patches

The mother-of-one used to work as an assistant in a salon where she would frequently change her hair styles, trying different colours every other week and applying a mass of products to her hair. 

The natural brunette bleached her hair blonde and numerous other shades over the years but the products she used caused her hair follicles to become blocked.

This meant new hair couldn't grow through leaving her with limp locks and bald patches.

She said: 'I hate my hair, it's all thinned, you don't expect it at 28, it's awful.'

The mother-of-one had dyed her hair numerous shades over the years, as pictured left and right, but lived to regret changing her style so often

Kellie said she tried her best to cover the bare spots through styling what hair she had but it made her feel self-conscious.

She said: 'I was so conscious of my hair loss and trying to cover it up, it became a massive part of my morning routine. I never left the house feeling satisfied and felt rubbish for the rest of the day. 

'My hair loss was never far from my mind which had a big effect on my confidence. 'I'm always thinking "can people see the bald patches?"'

She said she tried to find a solution for years and was terrified she'd go completely bald.  

'I've tried shampoo and conditioners, lotions from the chemist, hair vitamin tablets. I have spent an absolute fortune and nothing works,' she said. 

She added that she 'totally regrets' dyeing her hair so much.

Eventually she was referred to Simone Thomas, a clinician who herself had suffered from hair loss and believed she could help Kellie with her own condition.

The brunette said she used to spend hours styling her hair so bald patches wouldn't show

Kellie said about the consultation: 'Meeting Simone was amazing. I had been to loads of consultations for my hair loss but never truly felt that they understood me. That was totally different with Simone, knowing she had suffered from hair loss herself I could instantly relate to her and trusted her. 

'For the first time I felt like I was not the only one with hair loss. We spoke for over an hour and I finally got the answers I had been wanting for 10 years.'

Simone recommended 'Nioxin Dermabrasion' to Kellie - which is like a facial for the hair.

Simone explains: 'After speaking with Kellie about her hair thinning we decided that a Nioxin Dermabrasion treatment would be the best course of action to treat her condition. Nioxin is massaged into the scalp and works to help rejuvenate the scalp helping to provide a foundation for thicker and fuller hair to grow.' 

For Kellie's transformation on Channel 4, Simone also provided Kellie with a specialised hair piece to help with her hair loss in the short term and boost her self-esteem. 

Kellie said the hair piece has made her feel more confident until her natural hair is rejuvenated.

As a temporary measure, Kellie has been given a hair piece, which she is pictured wearing here, while her scalp is treated to rejuvenate her real hair 

She said: 'I no longer worry about having to cover my hair loss in the mornings as the system does that for me. It makes me feel so much more relaxed for the rest of the day and gives me more important time to spend with my son.'

Kellie is also delighted with the Nioxin treatment Simone has been able to provide her and feels like she has finally 'seen the light at the end of the tunnel'.

'The treatment is like a facial for the scalp and feels better than any other treatments I've had, plus I am already starting to see results. I can't thank Simone enough for helping me finally find a solution,' she said.
