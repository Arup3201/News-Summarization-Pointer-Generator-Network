Cuddled up, nose to nose, this image of a young calf and his lamb best friend could have come straight from the pages of a children's story.

Buddy the Calf and Larry the Lamb, who are both six-months-old, have become inseparable farmyard friends since they were both orphaned on the same day.

And the pair's close bond has saved them from the slaughterhouse, after warming the hearts of the Foster family, who own the farm in Hassop, Derbyshire where the unlikely pals spend their days frolicking in the fields.

Best friends: Buddy the Calf and Larry the Lamb become farmyard friends for life after they were both orphaned on the same day

Cheeky: Buddy and Larry poke out their tongues as they play in the fields surrounding their farm in Hassop, Derbyshire

'They were both orphaned on the same day so they were thrown together as the orphans of the family,' said Lucinda Foster, whose family owns the farm.

'Since then, they’ve become inseparable. They hate being without each other.

'They sleep next to each other and rest their heads on one another, it’s really sweet.

'There’s no way we could ever get rid of them now.'

Cuddled up: Buddy and Larry love to sleep next to each other, and like to rest their heads up against one another 

Orphans: Buddy and Larry were both born in March, but their mothers died when they were just days old. After failing to bond with other mothers they were bottle-fed

Buddy and Larry were both born in March, but their mothers died when they were just days old.

'We tried pairing them with other mothers but it just didn’t work out, and I didn’t want to leave them on their own in case they died,' said Miss Foster.

'They were both being bottle-fed with baby powder so we put them together and it didn’t matter that they were different.

'They just got on like a house on fire and it hasn’t changed since.'

Despite their rocky start, the unlikely duo  love nothing more than playing in the farmyard together.

Inseparable: The pair, who are six months old, love frolicking through the fields together, and hate to be apart - even if only for a short while

Friends for life: Farmer Lucinda Foster says both Buddy and Larry think each other is a lamb or a calf

Miss Foster, 20, said: 'They just love skipping around the fields together.

'They think each other is a lamb or a calf - it’s like they’re looking in the mirror.

'They’re the best of friends and they hate being apart, and they never seem to fight.

'I think they really will be friends for life.'
