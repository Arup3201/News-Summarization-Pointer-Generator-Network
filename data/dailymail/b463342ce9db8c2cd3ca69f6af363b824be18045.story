A businessman fed up with his partner sneaked out the office to play golf has showed him just how teed-off he was - by moving his entire office to the tenth hole on his favourite course.

Tony Coleshill, 50, set up a printing firm with Chris Antoniou in 2001 and built it up to make a £3 million annual turnover.

But a few years ago Mr Antoniou, 50, took up golf - and became hooked.

Teed off: Tony Coleshill was livid after realising his business partner Chris Antoniou was skiving to play golf

Confrontation: He moved Mr Antoniou's entire office to Heaton Moor Golf Club in Stockport, Manchester

Soon, his partner noticed he was failing to pull his weight as director.

Mr Coleshill said members of staff repeatedly spotted him on the golf course or the driving range during office hours where Chris allegedly told them to keep quiet.

Furious, he recruited four friends who took photos of his pal in action and went out 'undercover' himself in borrowed cars and caught him on the course.

He finally broke after a tough week at work and decided to put him off his stroke at last.

He hired a team of five removal men who tailed Chris heading to Heaton Moor Golf Course in Stockport, Grtr Manchester on yet another working day.

As he played the opening holes they set up his entire office - desk, cabinets, computer and even his coffee mug - by the side of the tenth tee.

When he rounded the corner with his clubs, Mr Coleshill handed an astonished Mr Antoniou a letter informing him he was looking at ways of ending the working relationship.

Mr Coleshill, from Stockport, said: 'He has not been pulling his weight for years and I think he must have thought I was pretty stupid.

Office: This was Mr Antoniou's set up at the pair's printing company in Greater Manchester, set up in 2001

Revenge: With the help of some friends, Mr Coleshill decided to completely dismantle his desk and cabinets

Making a point: He had noticed Mr Antoniou was nipping out the office every day to pot some holes

Every last bit: Even Mr Antoniou's mug was packed up and relocated to the course, while he was playing

'It was bugging me big time and I knew I had to do something.

'He's been leaving the office to pay golf three times a week when he was supposed to be at work.

'He'd disappear all the time so I thought, well, I'll just take his work to him.'

Mr Coleshill said he was putting in around 50 hours a week with his B2B1 Print Solutions company to make up for the work load.

He added: 'One particular day he came in at 9.10am and then he was off at 9.30am and I didn't see him for the rest of the day.

'I was driving home one day and it was really bugging me big time.

'I then saw this kid knocking a golf ball along and I thought 'I hate the sight of golf' and I realised what I could do.'

'Worth it': Mr Coleshill said he was putting in around 50 hours of work a week to make up for the backlog

Effort: The group hired a van to load the lot across to the golf course in one go

The ordeal left Mr Antoniou feeling distinctly under par when he pulled off his office move last month.

He said: 'We took the lot - desk, chair, his little filing cabinet, the printer, keyboard, screen and even his coffee mug which fittingly said 'Keep Calm And Play Golf'.

'Chris came around the corner and his face, it was absolute astonishment.

'It was totally unexpected. I said "Chris, I thought you were at work?" and he didn't say anything.

'I said "I've brought your work to you".

Letter: A shocked Mr Antoniou was handed a letter with details of plans to end their business partnership

'I said "I've got a letter for you here, you better read it very carefully". I walked away and left him with the problem of what to do with the desk.'

Mr Coleshill said the letter formally informed Mr Antoniou he was looking at ways of ending the working relationship and discussions are ongoing over the future of the company.

When asked for comment Mr Antoniou said: 'I don't want to publicise it to be honest.

'I've got no comment. I don't wish to comment at all.'
