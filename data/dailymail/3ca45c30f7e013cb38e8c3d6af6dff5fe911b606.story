The Shield actor Michael Jace choked and slammed his ex-wife against a wall as his baby son screamed in his crib, divorce papers claimed today.

The papers allege Jace, 51, has an explosive temper and also threatened to kill first wife Jennifer Bitterman when they were fighting for custody of little Jordan for years after their divorce in 2002.

In 2006 he sent her an email which read: 'Do you want to have a f***king war with me? I will f***ing kill you!'

The actor was today booked for the murder of his second wife, April Jace, 40, after he called 911 on Monday and allegedly confessed: 'I shot my wife.'

He is 
suspected of shooting April dead in the hallway of their Los Angeles 
home just 15 minutes after she returned from baseball practice with
 their two sons.

Jace
 made the 911 call at 8.30pm. The couple's two children, who are both 
under 10, reportedly witnessed the shooting and were taken in a 
distraught state to the police station and were put in care.

It has also been reported that the couple had been fighting over money and had been through a bankruptcy.

Divorce papers seen by MailOnline today claim that Jace had an alleged fearsome temper. Close friend Maria De La Vega testified on behalf of Bitterman. She said: 'Jordan was six months old. I was in the house and witnessed the first episode of physical abuse.

'Responsdent was raging and choked and hit petitioner and slammed her against the wall while Jordan screamed in the crib next to her'.

She claimed that 'there were multiple physical assaults' on Bitterman.

Bitterman petitioned for divorce on the grounds of irreconcilable differences in 1995. The couple separated for good in 1997, but did not have the divorce finalized until 2002.

In the papers, De La Vega claimed she saw the extent of anger and added that the things she saw were 'terrifying'. She added that it was clear that Jace's 'ambition was the most important thing to him and not his son and wife'.

In 2005, as Bitterman and Jace continued to fight over custody, the actor's ex-wife said in a declaration: 'The Respondent threatens corporal punishment and has spanked jordan for crying and being afraid. The Respondent's intimidation style of discipline has been a source of great anxiety to Jordan'.

Then in a 2006 declaration, Bitterman claimed Jace screamed at Bitterman in front of Jordan, harassed her in phone calls and also sent the 'I will f***ing kill you!' email.

Bitterman was awarded primary custody.

According to TMZ, April astonishingly testified on Jace's behalf. She said he provided a stable home for Jordan.

Meanwhile, it has emerged Jace filed for bankruptcy in March 2011 citing $500,000 in debts and an annual income of around $80,000.

He filed for Chapter 13, restructured his finances and reduced his mortgage, but owed $411,000 on the home where his wife was killed and it was believed to be on the brink of a foreclosure.

Jace was taken into custody and was later booked for his wife's murder, the LAPD confirmed on Tuesday. 

His bail has been set at $1million and according to police, the motive of the murder is believed to be domestic violence.  

Shortly before Jace called 911, police received calls from neighbors in the Hyde Park area
 who heard shots being fired inside the property after hearing arguing.

When officers entered the house they found April Jace, a mother-of-three, dead from gunshot wounds.

Police
 confirmed that at least two children - the third child is from a 
previous relationship - were in the home at the time of the shooting. 
Jordan is not believed to have been one of them. Jace and April had two 
young boys together.

They have been placed in protective custody but officers were 
reportedly furious it took Children's Services four hours to get to the 
station and take the children to a family member.

Jace was pictured at the scene on Monday night and appeared distraught as he spoke to an officer.

April and Michael Jace celebrated their ten-year wedding anniversary last June.

Photos from April's Facebook page show her playing happily with her three children, the oldest of whom is from a previous relationship.

His booking sheet shows that he was booked at 3.37am and is being held on $1,000,000 bail
