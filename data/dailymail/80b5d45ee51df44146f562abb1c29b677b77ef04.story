'The car park was full within half an hour of the doors opening. People came from as far as Manchester and Plymouth and the rain held off, which was great.'

The festival featured everything from a pug dog show to pet care advice and grooming. 

There was also a VIP (Very Important Pug) area, as well as activities for children and a number of stalls and shops inside the hotel. 

Martin added: 'We are not sure yet how much money was raised, but I think it will be well above £1,000. 

'It's just amazing to see how many people own pugs. We are now planning an event in the run-up to Christmas and Pugfest is definitely something we want to do every year. 

'But I think next time we are going to need a bigger venue.'
