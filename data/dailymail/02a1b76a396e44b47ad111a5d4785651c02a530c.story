Dopey Percy the pigeon flew half way around the world to Canada by mistake when he was supposed to be heading back to England from France.

The feather-brained bird was flying home to Cannock, in Staffordshire from Fougeres during a Blue Ribbon Race, but somehow got lost and ended up taking a 3,000 mile detour to Quebec.

Percy's owner Bernard Chambers (left) was shocked to hear of his 3,000 mile adventure.

He is thought to have hitched a ride on a few passing ships during his epic journey across the Atlantic.

Luckily for Percy a family of pigeon-lovers in Canada have given him a new home, and he is taking a well-earned rest.

Stewart Wardrop, General Manager of the Royal Pigeon Racing Association, said Percy was 'an extremely lucky bird.'

Percy got lost on his way home to Staffordshire from France and flew 3,000 miles across the Atlantic to Quebec in Canada.

'What he did is very rare,' he said.

'To land in the loft of a family of pigeon-fanciers after such a long journey is incredible.

'I can only imagine that he landed on a few ships on his way over, possible cruise-liners.

'There have been a few cases of this in the past, with people on cruise ships sending us photos of pigeons hitching a lift - but as I said, it's very rare.'

News of Percy's reappearance came as a relief to his worried British owner, Bernard Chambers, 75.

The retired decorator was shocked to hear of his feathered-friend's incredible adventure.

He told the Daily Express: 'I nearly fell off my chair when I found out where he was.

'He was one of our best pigeons. I'll miss him but I'm pleased he's found a new home.'

The bird's former home in Cannock, Staffordshire.
