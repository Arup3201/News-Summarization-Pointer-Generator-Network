One of the biggest Colombian drug lords was captured Tuesday night after building his trafficking empire for nearly two decades.

Daniel Barrera Barrera, who is known as 'El Loco' or 'the Madman', was arrested in neighboring Venezuela, topping off a year of significant blows to the region's drug trade.

It was the third arrest of a major Colombian drug boss in the last year.

President Juan Manuel Santos said Barrera was arrested in the Venezuelan city of San Cristobal after months of multi-national cooperation that included help from the United States and other nations.

'The last of the great capos has fallen,' Mr Santos said, using the common term for drug lords. 

'This is perhaps the most important arrest' in recent times, he said.

General Jose Roberto Leon, director of the National Police, said in a telephone interview later that the 50-year-old Barrera did not resist when he was caught alone on a road in San Cristobal, which is near the Colombia-Venezuela border.

General Leon said he expected Venezuela to deport Barrera, but did not know when.

The New York Times reports that in addition to the Venezuelan drug police, the CIA and British intelligence officers aided the operation.

While regional authorities obviously played a significant role in the takedown, the true extent of international help is slowly being revealed as the head of the Colombian national police, Major General Jose Roberto Leon Riano was in Washington at the time of the arrest in order to better facilitate communication with the Americans.

Barrera was one of Colombia's most wanted fugitives. Early last year, authorities announced a $2.7million reward for information leading to his capture, but Colombian officials did not say whether any tips from informants led to the arrest.

U.S. and Colombian officials have alleged that Barrera's gang supplies cocaine to Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, which ships the drug to the United States.

Barrera's arrest was the third involving alleged Colombian drug kingpins over the past 12 months.

On June 3, Venezuelan authorities arrested Diego Perez Henao, 41, who had a five million US dollar reward on his head for allegedly trafficking cocaine to the United States. He was sent to Colombia a few weeks later.

Last November, Maximilian Bonilla Orozco, 39, another alleged drug boss with a five million US dollar reward offered for him by the US, was caught in Venezuela. He was extradited directly to the United States in December.

While his capture is clearly a milestone in his personal criminal history, it is far from his first run-in with the law.

Previous find: In October 2010, Colombian police discovered $29million and 17million euros that belonged to Barrera in what was- at the time- the 'biggest seizure of drug money in this country's history'

Barrera was first imprisoned in February 1990 on drug charges but he managed to escape from the Colombian prison in October of that same year.

More recently, in October 2010, Colombian police discovered $29million and 17million euros that belonged to Barrera in what was- at the time- the 'biggest seizure of drug money in this country's history'.

Along with taking down one of the country's top drug kingpins, Tuesday's  arrest will greatly hinder Colombia's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (commonly known as FARC). Barrera was closely associated with the group.

Barrera is seen as the closest equivalent to a modern-day Pablo Escobar, with comparisons between the two drug lords being made frequently as they both developed ways to use bribery as a way to insure that they remained well-liked by prominent political figures from all sides of the spectrum.

Since Escobar was killed in 1993, the widespread nature of Barrera’s trafficking lent him the title as the most notorious Colombian drug dealer.
