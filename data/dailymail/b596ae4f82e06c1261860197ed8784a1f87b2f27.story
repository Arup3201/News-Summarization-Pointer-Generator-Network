Preparing for release: Karen Matthews pictured in handcuffs after leaving Dewsbury police station in 2008

Karen Matthews, who arranged the kidnapping of her own daughter Shannon to claim £50,000, is getting ready for an early prison release and to move abroad with her mystery admirer.

The 36-year-old has apparently been receiving letters from a wealthy admirer while serving her eight year sentence at Foston Hall prison in Derbyshire.

And the mother-of-seven, who is set to be released in April after serving just three years, is preparing to meet her pen-pal from northern England once freed.

Matthews’ admirer apparently started writing to her after seeing her photograph in a newspaper and penned that he’d ‘like to stroll along a beach with her’, the Sunday Mirror reported.

And a friend of the mother told the newspaper that she’s preparing to move to Cyprus once released.

The mother has lost three stone while locked up and has changed her hair colour to avoid being recognised once freed.

Earlier this year her hair was cut by fellow inmate and road rage killer Tracie Andrews.

She is said to be terrified that she’ll be attacked when out of prison and wants to move abroad to start a new life.

But Matthews won’t be allowed to permanently live overseas once freed on licence – only shorter unsupervised trips will be permitted.

While serving her sentence, Matthews has been on a block with convicted child killers and paedophiles, who have repeatedly attacked her in prison, according to previous reports.

An inmate told the Daily Mirror in June:
‘She’s had a bashing quite a few times. One a shampoo bottle was thrown
and it hit her in the face.

‘It’s made her too scared to mix. She even turn down a day release shopping trip as she feared she’d be attacked by the public.’

After being found guilty for her part in a plan that kept her daughter, now 12, drugged and tethered under a bed, she still claims her innocence.

Michael Donovan, then 40, was also jailed for his part in the abduction of Shannon Matthews in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire.

Evidence: When police tipped this bed, they noticed it was 'heavy' and then heard frightened cries from Shannon, the court heard during the trial

Donovan tied up the girl and drugged her before hiding her in a special compartment under a bed at his home.

She was found by police 24 days later after a £3.2 million manhunt.

Donovan is the uncle of Craig Meehan, the paedophile former boyfriend of Karen Matthews, who lived with her and four of her children.

Matthews and Donovan were jailed for conspiring to keep Shannon drugged and imprisoned in a desperate plan to claim £50,000 in reward money.
