In a surreal scene straight out of the movie The Hangover, a young mountain lion has been caught after trying to walk into a casino in downtown Reno, Nevada, ahead of the breakfast rush on Friday.

Nevada Department of Wildlife spokesman Chris Healy says the young male cat's behavior was ‘almost the equivalent of being a stupid teenager.’

Healy said coming-of-age cougars often end up where they shouldn't after being chased out of a territory by adults.

Lion's den of sin: The 100-pound cat was spotted by Harrah's guests while trying to negotiate the hotel's revolving door

Guests at Harrah's reported seeing the 100-pound cat trying to slip into the casino just before dawn on Friday. When the animal couldn't negotiate the revolving door, it hid under an outdoor stage in a nearby plaza.

State wildlife officials tranquilized the two-year-old cat and on Saturday, it was released into the wild after being tagged for participation in a University of Nevada at Reno study.

At around 5:16am on Friday, police started receiving calls about the big cat roaming the area around around the hotel. Officers who arrived on the scene set up a perimeter, warning the public to stay away and shutting down the main road through downtown Reno, KOLO-TV reported.

The adolescent cat holed up under a 
stage in the Harrah's Plaza in front of the casino. When wildlife 
officials responded to the scene, the cougar was tranquilized with three
 shots and transported by truck to Nevada Department of Wildlife's field
 office in Reno and then to the department’s office in Carson City, the Reno Gazette-Journal reported..

The animal was unharmed and no injuries to people were reported.

Wildlife experts believe that the young mountain lion likely arrived in Reno along the Truckee River corridor located just a few blocks north of Harrah’s.

On Saturday morning, the two-year-old
 cougar was released into the Carson Range in the Spooner Summit area 
above Lake Tahoe's east shore, Healy said.

‘He
 was fully ready to go,’ Healy explained. ‘He was feisty in the trap and
 snarled if you got too close. Once he decided to go, he quickly ran off
 into the underbrush and was gone.’

Wildlife
 biologists said the Carson Range is good area for mountain lions that 
features an abundance of mule, deer and smaller prey in the summer.

One strike, you're out: Wildlife officials say if the curious cougar is ever spotted in Reno again, it will likely be euthanized

Before the feline was released into its natural habitat, wildlife officials fitted it with a tracking collar that will allow researchers to monitor the cat’s movements and habits.

Mountain lion sightings have been reported around Reno in the past, Healy said, but not in the downtown casino area.

‘The best-case scenario is we never see it or hear from it again,’ Healy said, adding the cat probably would be put down if it is spotted in the city again.
