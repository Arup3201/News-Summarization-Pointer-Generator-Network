These otherworldly images give a rare glimpse inside caves so remote few humans have ever stepped foot inside.

With its peculiar pools of water, and strange coloured sediments, the bizarre-looking tunnels of the Shakuranskaya cave could be straight out of a science fiction film.

Found in the disputed region of Abkhazia, around 75 miles outside of Sochi, Russia, it is rumoured the incredible underground chambers were formed after a huge earthquake struck the area in 1892.

Surreal images from Abkhazia offer a rare glimpse inside remote caves that few humans have ever set foot inside

The incredible shots were taken by Vladimir Mulde, who spent the day photographing his friends in the cave, like Pavel (pictured right)

After causing part of a nearby mountain to collapse into the Amtkel River, it is thought the dam-like affect has created a series of interconnecting underground tunnels.

The incredible images were taken by Russian photographer, Vladimir Mulde, 31, who spent the day with a small group of friends tentatively making his way through the rarely seen terrain to capture the cavern on camera.

Amazingly, many parts of the cave are completely submerged underwater meaning much of it is still yet to be seen.

Vladimir said: 'This cave is one of the wonders of Abkhazia, it's so picturesque but the location is little known by tourists.

'It is thought the caves were born out of a huge earthquake that hit Abkhazia in 1892.

'There are three separate caves that you can explore but there also many more, however, they are completely filled with water.

Pools of varying depth line the floors of the cave, which appear to glow in an eerie green hue

'The walls are smooth in places and the reflection off the water creates interesting forms that makes you feel as if the cave is alive.

'We were surprised to find a huge opening, the colossal stalagmites and stalactites took our breath away.

'It took us the whole day to explore the cave inside and then get out again, it was like being in a completely different world.

'A team of scientists have planned to study the caves, I believe we've only scratched the surface as to the areas we can find.'
