After 36-hours of worrying about his fate, the family of a British oil worker held hostage in Algeria were finally rewarded with a text message form him reading: 'I'm safe.'

Yesterday Mark Grant's wife Emma made a tearful appeal for his safe 
return at their home in Grangemouth, central Scotland, saying: 'Please, I
just want him to come home safe. We’ve got a little girl to think 
about.'

Mark Grant, 29, contacted his family after the agonising wait with a text reading: 'I’m safe. Got me out this afternoon. With the Algerian army.'

Relief: Mark Grant and his wife Emma. Mark was one of the men taken hostage at a BP compound in the Sahara Desert, but today he made contact with home

Shortly after militants stormed the In Amenas gas plant on Wednesday morning Mrs Grant spoke to her husband.

But her fears were building as she had not spoken to him since so the text message was a welcome relief to his family who had been awaiting news, reported the Evening Standard.

He is employed by BP as a project services contracts administrator, having taken up the role more than two and a half years ago.

He had previously worked as a site 
quantity surveyor with Shell for more than a year and a half before his 
switch to the In Amenas project.

Yesterday Stephen McFaul, one of the oil workers held hostage phoned his wife Angela and told her: ‘I’m free, love, I’m free.’

Just hours earlier, he had made what he thought might be his last phone call, telling his relatives: ‘Al Qaeda have got me.’

Mr McFaul, 36, had also secretly texted his wife to tell her how his captors had herded him and others into a room and that he could hear bullets ‘flying about outside’.

But last night the oil company manager’s family spoke of their elation and relief at  the news that the father of five had managed to escape.

His brother Brian, speaking at their parents’ home in west Belfast 15 minutes after they had received news of his safety, told the Daily Mail: ‘He phoned Angela and she phoned us.

‘He told her, “I’m free, love, I’m free”.

‘Right now they’re getting him and other survivors to a safe camp. He is due to phone her later and then he’ll phone here to speak to mummy because she won’t be happy until she hears his voice.’

Brian, 41, said their other brother Mark spoke to Mr McFaul, who hails from the Irish Republic but lives in Belfast, on the phone and he could hear gunfire in the background.

Up to 12 British citizens are feared 
dead or injured after a botched rescue attempt at a BP compound in 
Algeria where they were being held by Al Qaeda terrorists.

David Cameron revealed that 'less 
than 30' British workers are unaccounted for as he gave terrifying 
details of the 'ongoing' hostage crisis in the Saharan desert. It is now
understood that 12 Britons are among the casualties.

In an extraordinary development, Algeria today refused repeated offers of help to bring its worst terror attack on Westerners under control. But the Prime Minister is to send specialist Met Police negotiators and SAS forces to the capital city Algiers in the hope Britain can step in.

Norway, who also has citizens caught up in the crisis, will be sending its own special forces to the BP plant, regardless of whether the Algerians agree to it, as the situation could continue for days, sources say.

In a statement to MPs the Prime Minister blasted the Algerian government for staging the secret 'all guns blazing' rescue mission despite offers of SAS help and his demands to be told of any operation that could put British lives at risk.

'We were disappointed not to be informed of this in advance... this is a large and complex site and they are still pursuing terrorists and possibly some of the hostages in other areas of the site,' he said.

‘I offered UK technical and intelligence support – including from experts in hostage negotiation and rescue - to help find a successful resolution. And I urged that we and other countries affected should be consulted before any action was taken.

The Prime Minister said a terrorist group believed to be operating under Mokhtar Belmokhtar launched a ''well calculated heavily armed' assault on buses en route to the airfield at In Amenas before attacking the residential compound and gas facility.

Two of those travelling in the convoy to the airfield were killed, including a Briton.

'According to the information we have
from the Algerian authorities, the terrorists first attacked two buses 
en route to the In Amenas airfield before attacking the residential 
compound and the gas facility at the installation,' he said.

'It appears to have been a large, well-co-ordinated and heavily armed assault and it is probable that it had been pre-planned.

'Two of those travelling in the 
convoy to the airfield were, very sadly, killed, including one British 
national and his family were informed on Wednesday.

'A number of other workers were taken
hostage by the terrorists in separate locations, both at the 
residential compound and the gas facility.

'The precise numbers involved remain 
unclear at this stage but the hostages included British nationals, along
with nationals of at least seven other countries and, of course, many 
Algerians.'

BP, the joint operator of the gas 
plant, has also begun evacuating staff from Algeria, with 11 being flown
back to London yesterday.

'There is perhaps more we need to do 
to make sure the companies have a really good up-to-date list of not 
only the people who work for them but also of subcontractors,' he said.

'On this occasion there were some issues and difficulties with that.'

'We will continue to do everything we
can to hunt the people down who are responsible for this and for other 
such terrorist outrages'.

In the worst terror attack on Britons
since 7/7, the UK has been plunged into a diplomatic crisis when at 
least 30 hostages were killed in the Sahara Desert, with at least two 
Britons among the dead after Algerian troops attacked their captors.

Algerian
sources said this afternoon 573 of total 650 hostages now free, 
including 77 of 132 foreign nationals, meaning the whereabouts of 55 
foreigners are still unknown.
