Turkish side Besiktas have enquired about a January move for Tottenham captain Younes Kaboul.

The former Portsmouth defender has not started Spurs' last nine league games having fallen out of favour at White Hart Lane. 

Everton also have an interest in Kaboul, who Maruicio Pochettino surprisingly gave the captain's armband in the summer after team-mates backed the Frenchman.

Tottenham will look to offload their fringe players before making a move for Aston Villa's Fabian Delph. 

The England international's contract is running down and he is also attracting interest from Liverpool, but Villa want to hold onto him until the summer.

That would suit Tottenham who are in no major rush to add to their midfield at this stage - unless a top target becomes available.

That is despite Ryan Mason picking up an injury, and Nabil Bentaleb leaving for the African Cup of Nations this month.

Benjamin Stambouli and Paulinho have deputised in recent weeks.
