Residents of a New York City neighborhood can count a cult among their many neighbors, according to a report.

The Congregation for the Light calls Manhattan's Murray Hill area home and preaches the impending end of days and the power of karmic retribution to  men and women who believe they descend from an Aryan super race that once populated Atlantis, reports the New York Post.

With all the hallmarks of a cult, it's no surprise 'the Light,' as its 200 members call it, also has some disenchanted former members spreading tales of its sinister side.

Cult next door? This brownstone in Manhattan's Murray Hill neighborhood houses the Congregation of the Light, a group some ex-members say is a cult with some extremely odd beliefs

Former member Paul Arthur Miller described to the Post a young adulthood full of indentured servitude in leader Tom Baer's furniture factory, physical training for a doomsday that never seemed to come and a culture of homophobia.

'The belief is that Planet Earth will be ending soon and we would have to defend our people and safeguard our food and supplies,' 58-year-old Miller recalled to the Post.

'They changed the doomsday date at least twice,' he said. 'We were told it was imminent, weeks or months. People in the cult wouldn't have dental work done because they thought, 'Why bother?''

Symbols: The group speaks much of symbolism and, according to an ex-member, will not allow members to have any decor in their home that does not include an owl or a cross with an x

Miller said the group believed that once that doomsday did finally come, group members would ascend to a planet called Nay where they'd live blissfully and without gender or stomachs.

But only those who did as they were told. Women, for instance, are not allowed to seek out higher education and must in most cases be married off in their teens in order to stay a part of the group. 

Miller said he was repeatedly singled out for his homosexuality, which the group's leaders called 'a hangover from the Roman Empire.'

He was forced to leave his boyfriend and date women. 

The group, Miller said, bans all decor in a home that doesn't contain its symbols: the owl and a cross with an 'x.' 

'You were always told if you leave the Light, you're subjected to evil . . . because you don't have protection,' Miller said. 

'I didn’t start living until I left the Light,' he said.

Among the group's other purported strange beliefs involve where they think they have their roots.

'They believe in a master Aryan race . . . that lived on Atlantis,' another former member, this one anonymous, told the Post.

The Light meets in a brownstone on 35th Street once per week where Baer preaches to a few dozen men and women, who aren't allowed to take notes or read from a text. 

In the group's defense, Baer says he doesn't categorize it as a religion.

'We’re what a church should be,' he told the Post. 'The principles are to have a decent, sane and healthy life.' 

Ex-members say 'the Light' believes members descend from an Aryan super race who once populated Atlantis, shuns homosexuality as 'a hangover from the Roman Empire' and that once the doomsday comes the group will resurrect to a planet called Nay as a genderless race with no stomachs =
