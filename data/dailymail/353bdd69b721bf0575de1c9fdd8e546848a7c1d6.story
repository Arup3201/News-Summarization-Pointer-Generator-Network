A young father who was told he faced losing both his wife and their newborn baby when she went into premature labour is celebrating after his miracle family were allowed home for the first time.

Kyle Moynan, 26, from Carlisle, Cumbria, was told that wife Lauren's life hung in the balance after she went into labour at 27 weeks suffering from pre-eclampsia.

Medics told him they would have to perform an emergency caesarean to stand any chance of saving Lauren's life, but that the couple's daughter would probably not survive such an early birth.

Terrified Kyle was forced to give the go-ahead for emergency surgery aware that both his wife and daughter may not survive.

Although surgeons managed to stabilise Lauren, tiny baby Evie was kept in intensive care for months while doctors tried to help her grow strong enough to survive.

But now, they are celebrating after Evie, now seven months, has been allowed to come home for the first time - a day Kyle feared he'd never see.

Kyle said: 'There was a time when I feared I'd never have either my wife or my baby at home again - to have them both here is amazing.

'It was the worst experience of my life. It was so traumatic and I could do nothing but just stand there and watch while the doctors tried to save Lauren and baby Evie.

'I was worried I was going to lose them both.

'I am just so relieved to have them both home and safe now. I am grateful to all the doctors who saved their lives.'

Lauren was rushed into the Cumberland Infirmary after going into labour in the middle of the night when she was just under six months pregnant.

Doctors quickly established she was suffering from pre-eclampsia, leading to organ failure.

HGV engineer Kyle said: 'Lauren was wired up in the hospital bed. It was horrendous. All I could do is just stand there and watch while the doctors rushed around.

'There wasn't time for them to explain what was going on, so I had to just stand there and wait. I knew it had to be serious because of the way they were rushing around but I didn't have a clue what was happening.

'After what felt like forever a nurse pulled me to one side and told me that Lauren's life was in danger and in order to save her life they would have to deliver Evie.'

Distraught Kyle then had to give to go-ahead for an emergency caesarean for Lauren, even though doctors warned Evie's chance of survival were slim, and it was a massive risk.

He said: 'It was all a blur and I knew it was risky but I couldn't face losing Lauren and Evie, so I agreed for her to be delivered.

'We have two other daughters, Faye, eight, and Sophie, five, and I had to stay strong for them.'

Lauren said: 'I was so ill and they were pumping me full of drugs. I had cannulas in both arms and doctors all around me. I was just terrified that I would lose my baby.'

Luckily Evie was safely delivered but weighed only a tiny 1lb and 3oz and Kyle only had five minutes to see his newborn before she was rushed to Newcastle's Royal Infirmary by ambulance, where medics fought to regulate her breathing.

Lauren said: 'We didn't know if baby Evie would survive but because I was so poorly myself I didn't really know that much about it.'

Lauren stayed in hospital for a further two weeks and Evie was kept in an incubator in intensive care, where her life hung in the balance for two months later as a result of her being delivered so early.Dedicated parents Lauren and Kyle travelled to the hospital every day to visit baby Evie, who spent two months in intensive care and one in high dependency before being transferred to the Special Care Baby Unit at the Cumberland Infirmary, from where she has just been released.

Lauren said: 'I would never have expected something this drastic would have happened. I just woke up and I was in labour all of sudden. Kyle was at work and I was so scared - luckily he made it to the hospital just in time.'

The family are now relieved that Evie has been finally allowed home, aged seven months.

Lauren, who works as a nursery practitioner was still working until the day Evie was born. She said: 'I had only just started to think about getting things for Evie - we didn't have her room ready or any clothes for her.'

Baby Evie still has to use an oxygen canister to help her breathe but now weighs a more healthy 12lbs.

Lauren said: 'I can't believe I was so close to losing my own life, and my baby's. It was such a whirlwind but I am just glad we are home and safe and Evie is doing so well.'

Kyle said: 'I am thankful for all the doctors did to save Lauren's life and miracle baby Evie is doing well at home and getting stronger every day.'
