Former Manchester United trio Paul Scholes, Gary Neville and Phil Neville were in attendance as they saw their promotion chasing Salford City side beaten 3-1 by Brighouse Town.

The club's part owners were probably hoping the game would take their mind off of Manchester United’s embarrassing draw with Cambridge on Friday night, but they went home disappointed.

Two red cards didn't help the away side’s cause as a bumper crowd of 515 turned up to watch the Evo-Stik NPL Division One game, with many hoping to catch a glimpse of the ex-United stars.

Man United legend Scholes criticised selfie stars earlier in the week.

But the former England midfielder and co were only too happy to give the fans what they wanted as they posed for pictures and spoke with interested fans.

Even Neville Neville, Gary and Phil’s father, was in attendance but it was a far cry from what he would've seen when watching his own children play in their glory days.

The club’s part owners have high hopes of guiding Salford through the non-League pyramid system, but the disappointing defeat will have disrupted their plans.
