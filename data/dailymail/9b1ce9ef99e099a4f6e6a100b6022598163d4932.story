A 23-year-old man has died after getting into difficulty during a swim while ‘under the influence of alcohol’ at a popular surf spot.

The man, who has not yet been formally identified but who is believed to be from Cornwall, died after getting into trouble off Towan Beach in Newquay in the early hours of this morning.

Police and coastguard crews launched a major search for the swimmer after he was reported missing in the water by a friend at about 2.45am.

The 23-year-old man, who has not yet been formally identified, died after getting into difficulty while swimming off Towan Beach in Newquay (pictured) while 'under the influence of alcohol' in the early hours of this morning

He was found in a 'serious condition' by emergency crews off a neighbouring beach and flown to the Royal Cornwall Hospital (Treliske) in Truro in a search and rescue helicopter from RNAS Culdrose. 

However, he later passed away from his injuries. Police said his next of kin had been informed.

The Maritime and Coastguard Agency said the search operation was launched after a 999 call reported a man ‘under the influence’ in the water.

A spokesman said: ‘At 2.43am the coastguard received a 999 call from a lady on a Newquay beach reporting that her boyfriend and a friend had gone swimming in the sea while under the influence of alcohol and only one of them had returned.

‘The missing swimmer was located in the surf line by the Newquay inshore lifeboat.

‘The ambulance crew attended to the casualty before being airlifted to Treliske Hospital where he was later declared deceased.’

The agency said the search and rescue helicopter from RNAS Culdrose was joined by coastguard crews from Newquay and Padstow and police officers in looking for the man.

A Devon and Cornwall spokesman said: ‘Just before 3am police, ambulance and the coastguard responded to a report of concern for a swimmer at Towan Beach, Newquay.

‘After conducting a search of the water and beaches in the area, a man was found in the water near Great Western beach.

‘The man was taken to Treliske Hospital via the search and rescue helicopter where sadly he later died.

‘The deceased is thought to be a 23-year-old man from Cornwall. His next of kin have been informed although he has not been formally identified.'

Devon and Cornwall Police said the death is not being treated as suspicious and confirmed officers are now investigating on behalf of the coroner.
