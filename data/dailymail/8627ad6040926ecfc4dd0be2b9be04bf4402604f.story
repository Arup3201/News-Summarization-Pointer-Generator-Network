The man charged with funding terrorism after Tuesday's early morning raids came to the defence of the Islamic State on Facebook and branded the decapitation of American journalist James Foley as 'lies'.

Hassan El Sabsabi was arrested at his home in Seabrook, Melbourne after AFP officers were tipped off by their FBI counterparts that he was allegedly sending money to an American fighter in Syria.

He had been under observation for eight months. 

The 23-year-old appeared in Melbourne Magistrates Court on Tuesday afternoon charged with six counts of intentionally making funds available to a terrorist organisation.

The man was arrested in Seabrook on Tuesday morning following terror raids across five suburbs in Melbourne - Seabrook, Meadow Heights, Flemington, Kealba and Broadmeadows

The 23-year-old Seabrook man appeared at the the Melbourne Magistrates Court on Tuesday afternoon

Around 25,000 pages from social media accounts and 500 telephone calls and messages will have to be analysed as part of the case against the accused, the court heard. 

Police said earlier that about $12,000 had allegedly been provided to a man in the United States, allowing him to join terrorist militants in Syria some months ago, where he continues to fight there.

Prosecutor Andrew Doyle was granted more time to prepare his brief of evidence against El Sabsabi because of the volume of material, a lot of which needs to be transcribed and in some cases translated.

'A substantial amount of material will be sourced from overseas,' Mr Doyle told the court.

El Sabsabi's lawyer Trieu Huynh asked for his client to be transferred from the Melbourne Custody Centre to the Melbourne Assessment Prison as soon as possible. He is due to reappear on February 3.

'Given the nature of the charges (and) it's his first time in custody, it's extremely onerous on him,' he said. 

He also asked for a doctor to examine his client as soon as possible for his medical conditions, which Mr Huynh said he would not outline in open court.

In social media posts seen by Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday, last month El Sabsabi leapt to the defence of the Islamic State and labelled a story reporting the beheading death of U.S. journalist James Foley as ‘lies’.

‘(You) can never judge the actions of an individual based on a whole group,’ he said.

‘Second, how do you know this wasn’t a soldier, the mujahideen are out there doing what no one has the courage to do it is them against the world.’

El Sabsabi is a Facebook fan of controversial Perth preacher Mohammed Junaid Thorne, as well as a page condemning the death of a 16-year-old U.S. citizen in a drone strike in Yemen. 

He had posted an image which said 'Aussie and bloody proud of it!' as his cover photo last month.

In a post last month, El Sabsabi also said the media was filled with ‘lied and deception… a weapon used for hate and destruction’. 

One neighbour, Herve Du Buisson Perrine, 71, described El Sabsabi as a ‘very friendly’ man in an interview with The Australian.

‘I speak to him almost every day,’ the newspaper quoted Mr Du Buisson Perrine saying. ‘He likes gardening. I like gardening. I’ve given him advice about his lemon trees.’

‘He’s a very friendly, very nice guy.’

Neighbour Sandeep Singh, 32, saw the man arrested and taken away in a car. 

'I've seen him but never spoken to him,' Mr Singh told Daily Mail Australia. 'He was alright, says hello and that's it.'

Mr Singh said it was 'a bit scary' to see counter terrorism activity on his street.   

Police said the joint Australian Federal Police and Victoria Police counter terrorism raids in Seabrook, Meadow Heights, Flemington, Kealba and Broadmeadows on Tuesday morning were not related to last week's incident in Endeavour Hills in which an alleged terror suspect was shot dead.

Australian Federal Police Assistant Commissioner Neil Gaughan said police took action because they believed more money was about to be sent to the US citizen, who has been fighting in Syria for several months.  

'We are of the view that further funds were about to be transferred to this person in Syria, so today was about an overt action to resolve this matter,' he said. 

In parliament Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Australians who fund terrorists are complicit in their 'dreadful deeds'.

Mr Abbott said the anti-money laundering agency Austrac had been given an extra $20 million to help track down terrorist funding.

Federal cabinet has yet to give final approval for a combat mission in Iraq to fight Islamic State.

But Mr Abbott said that subject to cabinet consideration 'our objective is to support governments that don't commit genocide against their own people, nor allow their territory to support terrorism against our people'. 

ASIO will brief state and territory attorneys-general and police ministers at a meeting in Geelong on Friday on the national security threat. Australian Federal Police officers will also brief the meeting on recent raids. 

A neighbour said the arrested man moved into the Seabrook residence with his wife in December

Assistant Commissioner Gaughan said  police executed  six more search warrants at residences outside Seabrook to gain evidence in relation to the charges against the man.

'There is no suggestion at this stage that those people were involved in any criminality,' he said. 

The searches that were conducted were done 'in a far more low-key manner' than other recent terror raids in Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, Victoria Police Deputy Commissioner Graham Ashton said.

'This is a terrorism financing case, we didn't assess there being a significant community safety risk or a significant risk to our officers,' he said. 

The 23-year-old man was arrested on Point Cook Road opposite Seabrook Primary School. 

Victorian Premier Denis Napthine said he was briefed by police as Tuesday's raids started and was told they were part of a long-running and ongoing counter-terrorism operation. 

'They are not about a specific threat or there is certainly no immediate concern for public safety,' Dr Napthine told 3AW. 

More than 100 police officers executed seven search warrants across Melbourne at 6.45am on Tuesday

There is no intelligence to indicate the man was planning a terrorist attack and police believe he acted alone

The premier also urged the community to be tolerant and come together at this time, and said law enforcement was 'ahead of the game' in combating the risk of terrorism.

'It's a sad situation that we now face, but we can have confidence in the work of ASIO, the Australian Federal Police and the VicPol. They do a terrific job,' Dr Napthine said. 

This comes after the two police officers stabbed last week before the fatal shooting of an alleged terrorist at Endeavour Hills  released a statement.

'We would like to thank our family, friends, colleagues and everyone who has helped and supported us through this difficult time,' they said. 

'We are both holding up well and appreciate everyone's kind thoughts and well wishes. We ask that our privacy is respected while we continue to recover.'

Police fatally shot Numan Haider outside the Endeavour Hills police station where it was arranged they would meet the 18-year-old after conducting raids on his home Tuesday morning. 

It was agreed that Haider would greet a Victoria Police senior constable and a 43-year-old AFP officer cordially on Tuesday night.

Seconds after meeting the 18-year-old he took out a weapon and repeatedly stabbed both officers.

He was then killed by a single shot. 

On Tuesday, Deputy Commissioner Ashton said Haider's family received death threats in the days after his death, which was concerning.

He stressed Haider's family had nothing to do with the incident involving the 18-year-old.

'Family, particularly the parents of the young man, received death threats over the weekend,' he told reporters. This is an innocent family.

'I think the fact they received those deaths threats last week is very disappointing.'
