Hand(set) in hand: Earning the right to keep his beloved BlackBerry was one of Barack Obama's first major political victories when he walked into the White House

For years they were the most photographed power-couple in U.S. politics, always together, hand(set) in hand.

But after a long and faithful companionship, Barack Obama may finally be about to call time on his relationship with his beloved BlackBerry for a younger model... a touch-screen Android smartphone.

The military unit responsible for White House communications is testing a batch of new handsets for use by government staff, it was revealed today.

And one of the most likely replacements is an Android smartphone such as the Samsung Galaxy with beefed-up security to better cater for the U.S. president's phone and web-browsing needs.

'We can confirm that the White House 
Communications Agency, consistent with the rest of the Department of 
Defense, is piloting and using a variety of mobile devices,' a Defense 
Department spokesman told the Wall Street Journal. He declined to 
comment on the devices in the pilot test or in use at the White House.

But
 the suggestion that Obama may have fallen out of love with his 
BlackBerry months ago when it was revealed in December he had asked if 
he could switch to an iPhone but was turned down amid 'security 
concerns'.

However, his dream of using an iPhone for his voicecall and web-browsing needs will remain unfulfilled after it was revealed the White House is only testing phones from Samsung and LG, which both run on Google’s Android operating system.

He is still, however, allowed an Apple iPad for reading, a source confirmed.

A
 Samsung spokesman declined to comment on whether its phones were being 
tested at the White House. 'We have seen strong interest from the 
government sector and are working closely with various agencies to 
deploy pilot programs,' he said.

Government
 orders have long bolstered BlackBerry’s revenue, but as the company’s 
market share continues to wane, those contracts are becoming harder to 
secure in spite of BlackBerry's best efforts.

CEO
 John Chen held talks with the White House earlier this month in a bid 
to shore up support for the smartphone through the U.S. corridors of 
power, Bloomberg reported.

BlackBerry shared closed down 1.3 per cent yesterday on the NASDAQ, trading at $10.61. The company laid off more than 30 per cent of its employees last autumn after posting nearly $1 billion in losses.

In 2009, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said a compromise had been reached to allow the president to use the BlackBerry to keep in touch with senior staff and some personal friends. He did not say with whom the compromise had been struck.

Gibbs said Obama will limit its use, and that security has been enhanced to protect his communications.

Previous presidents chose not to use e-mail because it can be subpoenaed by Congress and the courts, and may be subject to public records laws.

Gibbs said the presumption from the White House counsel's office is that the e-mails will be subject to the Presidential Records Act, which requires the National Archives to preserve presidential records.

But he also said some exemptions in the law allow for 'strictly personal communications.' He did not say how that classification would be determined, but made clear that the device could be used for both business and personal exchanges.

Obama's BlackBerry has been a constant companion, and he had noted publicly that he was negotiating to find a way to keep it despite security concerns and records-keeping issues.

Gibbs said that Obama believes using the device will help him escape the 'bubble' that surrounds the president.
