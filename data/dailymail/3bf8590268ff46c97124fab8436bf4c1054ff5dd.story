Parents are demanding that supermarket giant Asda withdraws two blood-stained Halloween costumes, claiming they make their children look like 'shot teenagers'.

Pictures of the two outfits, designed for children as young as nine, show ripped American footballer and cheerleader uniforms splattered with fake blood.

The cheerleader fancy dress, which can be bought with socks and pom poms has already sold out online in ages 9-10 and 11-12. Both costumes are also sold in stores. 

'Bad taste': Parents have signed an online petition that urges Asda to withdraw their cheerleader and American football Halloween costumes. They claim the outfits, pictured, make their children look like 'shot teenagers'

Mother Sheila Pinney, from Bristol, said that she was 'left speechless' when she saw the costumes at her local Asda while looking for something for her son.

She said that the costumes, which cost between £8 and £14, are in 'incredibly bad taste, even for Halloween'.

Mrs Pinney wrote a letter to CEO Andy Clarke requesting that the costumes be removed and has urged those outraged by the move to sign her online petition. So far the list, which is hosted by change.org, has more than 130 signatures.

Writing on the website, Mrs Pinney said: 'I was actually left speechless when I saw the costumes, while seeking a suitable fancy dress costume for my 4-year old son. 

'He asked me what the costumes were, as he is familiar with ghosts, skeletons and the usual Halloween imagery, and I actually couldn't form the words to explain what they were, as how can you tell a 4-year old that he is looking at costumes depicting "shot teenagers"?'

Gory: Sheila Pinney, who started the online petition, said she was left speechless when she saw the blood-stained costumes while shopping in Asda 

According to the Asda website, the Halloween Cheerleader Fancy Dress Costume is 'sure to be a hit'. 

It claims: 'With scary detailing and pompoms, she’ll be set for all events this season'.

While the Halloween American Footballer Fancy Dress Costume, which comes with shoulder padding and 'bone detailing' on the left leg, promises to 'scare everyone at those Halloween parties'. 

One person supporting the petition wrote: 'This is in the worst taste possible. Disgusting!'

Another said: 'I don't want our children subjected to or involved with such grotesque costumes.'

A spokesman for Asda said: 'We appreciate that it isn't for everyone but the majority of our customers love dressing up at Halloween, especially in spooky or gory costumes which inevitably can include fake blood.'

Last year Asda and supermarket giant Tesco were forced to apologise and withdraw two Halloween costumes when they were criticised for stigmatising people with mental health issues. 

Asda dropped its 'mental patient fancy dress costume', and Tesco later withdrew its 'psycho ward' outfit.

Both stores apologised for any offence caused and agreed to make donations to the mental health charity, Mind. The charity, which complained that such costumes 'fuel' stigma, received £25,000 from Asda. 

The £20 Asda outfit included ragged clothing, fake blood, a mask and a fake meat cleaver while Tesco's orange boiler suit came with a plastic jaw restraint and offered to 'complete the look' with a machete.
