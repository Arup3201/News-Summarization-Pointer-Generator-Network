A super-wealthy couple of web entrepreneurs who sold Bebo for £370 million are investing cash to save a derelict pub - in Devon.

Michael and Xochi Birch, who are based in California, received the staggering sum for the social network in 2008.

They have now given themselves a new project - bringing a rundown pub back to its former glory.

The Farmers Arms in Woolsery, North Devon, closed in 2012 and has fallen into disrepair. It has now been saved because millionaire Michael Birch says the village is his 'spiritual home'.

Michael and Xochi Birch, who founded Bebo in 2005 and sold it to AOL in 2008 for $850million, have bought the Farmers Arms pub. Mr Birch says the village is his 'spiritual home'

He was born in Hertfordshire but his family ties in the village date back to the 1700s, when the Andrew family came to Woolsery.

Job Andrew, Mr Birch's great-great grandfather, built Woolsery village shop, which remained in the family until it was sold in 1961.

His grandmother, Millicent Andrew, was born in the village shop's premises in 1900, and his grandfather Joseph Burrow was born at Ashcroft Farm.

The pub will be restored to its former glory and the Manor House which they also bought will be turned into a hotel.

Michael, 44, said: 'We share the local community's enthusiasm for the Farmers Arms and Manor House. These buildings are important assets and will be tastefully restored.

'Before we put out the welcome mat we ask everyone for their support, cooperation and patience as we undertake the mammoth task of planning and restoring the buildings to their rightful place of historical significance in the village of Woolsery.'

Michael and his wife set up Bebo in 2005 with the social media website shorthand for 'Blog Early, Blog Often'.

Locals in Woolsery are hoping their midas touch will pay off with their purchase of the pub and manor house

It was a huge success and became one of the world's most popular websites with AOL buying it for $850 million three years later.

The couple made $600 million from the sale but then had to watch as the site crumbled, in part due to  the meteoric rise of Facebook.

Last year they bought the site back for $1 million 'for fun' to see if they could inject life into it.

Locals in Woolsery are hoping their midas touch will pay off with their purchase of the pub and manor house.

Robin Edmonds, chairman of Woolsery Parish Council, said: 'The centre of our once picturesque rural village has been blighted in recent times by the presence of two Grade II listed buildings that have been allowed to fall into a very sad state of disrepair.

'The Parish Council is very relieved to learn that not only have the Farmers Arms and Manor House been sold, but that they have been sold to the same buyer who has a long term association with Woolsery village and a very strong desire to return both properties to their former glory.'

Villagers on the Woolsery Action Group Facebook page have also expressed their excitement over the development.

Mr Edmonds added: 'The residents of Woolsery are very fortunate to find a new owner who is passionate about restoring the pub and is happy to make the considerable investment required to achieve this.

'The restoration of the Manor House and putting it into use as a hotel is an unexpected bonus for the whole village.

'The transformation of these two buildings will not happen overnight, but we look forward to seeing them both once again contributing to the daily life of the village in the foreseeable future.'
