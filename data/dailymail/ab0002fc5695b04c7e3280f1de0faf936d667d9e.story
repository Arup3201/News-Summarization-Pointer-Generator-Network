A dangerous fugitive wanted for a knife attack on a teenage girl has taunted police by setting up a new Facebook page - and posting a photograph of himself posing in a wig and glasses.

The picture shows brazen thug Michael Easy, 27, sporting the fancy dress items while pressing his finger to his lips - apparently mocking police for failing to track him down.

But the silver wig and Dame Edna Everage-style sunglasses do little to hide the identity of the man who has been on the run since May following the attack on the 19-year-old in Southampton.

Mocking: Michael Easy, 27, a prime suspect in a knife attack in Southampton in May, posted this picture on Facebook in an apparent reference to police officers' failed attempts to find him

Easy is a prime suspect in the incident, which saw a 19-year-old woman's neck cut outside a party.

The 27-year-old, who has a history of attacking women, allegedly punched her in the face and kicked her in the thigh before cutting her neck with an eight-inch knife.

Detectives immediately launched a manhunt as the serial offender, who has more than 27 convictions on his record, went on the run.

Police have branded him a danger to the public and will make a national TV appeal to try and catch the fugitive.

'Danger to the public': The 27-year-old has set up a Facebook account under the name 'Michelle Dirt'

He has repeatedly taunted detectives on the internet since he went on the run five weeks ago.

After the alleged attack, Easy, who is of no fixed abode, vanished - but took time out while in hiding to update his Facebook profile, which he holds under a different name.

He previously uploaded a new 
photograph of himself just 24 hours after allegedly unleashing a 
terrifying knife attack on the teenager.

In
his latest stunt he has set up a new Facebook account under the name 
'Michelle Dirt', running in tandem with his original account, which 
bears the name 'Michael Dirt'.

Police
refused to comment on the account, but Sergeant Al Dineley, from the 
integrated offender management team, is hopeful that the national appeal
will help.

He said: 'We 
have carried out extensive local inquiries and liaised with other police
forces across the country to track Michael Easy down.

'We have had positive responses to our local appeals but we want to expand our appeal to the whole country now.

'We
have used Crimewatch successfully many times before and we are hopeful 
that the programme will generate further sightings and bring in fresh 
information for us.

'I would urge Michael Easy - or anyone who knows where he is - to get in touch with police.

'We have teams of officers working to locate him and we are not going to give up trying to find him.'

The
teenage victim was hit in the face and suffered a thigh injury in the 
knife attack which took place in the early hours of Sunday, May 26.

Detectives have also advised two women feared to be at risk from Easy to move house.

They
believe Easy may no longer be hiding in Southampton and want to raise 
awareness in London where the Metropolitan Police have been working with
detectives.

His string of 
previous offences includes an unprovoked attack on his girlfriend in 
front of her toddler son nearly four years ago.
