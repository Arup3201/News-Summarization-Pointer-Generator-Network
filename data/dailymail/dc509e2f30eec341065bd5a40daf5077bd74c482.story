A group of Liverpool football supporters are suing the police for more than £1million after they were 'wrongfully imprisoned' on their coaches on the way back from an away game.

Members of Spirit of Shankly (SOS), a 'supporters' union', claim their human rights were violated during the four-hour journey from a match against Sunderland.

The fans, including disabled supporters and mothers with young children, say they were not allowed to go to the toilet at motorway service stations because the officers escorting their coaches would not let them off.

SOS is launching legal claims against Durham, North Yorkshire, West Yorkshire, and Greater Manchester police forces over the incident in March 2011, which involved 500 fans travelling on 12 coaches.

'The mood of most people on the coach was very irate,' said SOS committee member Roy Bentham. 'There were kids and women who couldn't use the facilities and the toilets were blocked.

'A lot of people were thirsty and dehydrating. It was quite a warm day. There were kids who were crying. We had a disabled lad on the coach and he needed the toilet and it was horrendous.

'We are [talking about] a seven-figure sum settlement and that's before the legal costs. The claim will go forward on wrongful imprisonment because the police's actions on that day were not proportionate and were unreasonable, and they were heavy-handed.'

Mr Bentham said he expected proceedings to start in court later this year.

Disabled fan Chris McNulty said he felt 'humiliated' by the ordeal of being confined to the coach, and had since shunned the transport.

Other supporters said they were banned from getting off at one of the vehicle's scheduled stops.

Mark Milsom, of West Yorkshire Police, said: 'The force received a letter in September 2013 representing supporters who attended the Sunderland vs Liverpool fixture in March 2011.

'Our legal department replied to the letter repudiating any legal claim, and we have had no further correspondence on the matter.'

A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: 'We have spoken to our civil litigation department and they have no record of any papers being served on them in relation to this or of any other complaints relating to that day.'

Durham Police and North Yorkshire Police declined to comment on the fans' claims.
