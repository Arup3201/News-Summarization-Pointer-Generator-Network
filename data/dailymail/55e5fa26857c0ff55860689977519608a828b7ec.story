Swansea City have enquired about Holland international Jordy Clasie and are also showing interest in Crystal Palace midfielder Jonathan Williams.

Feyenoord's Clasie, 22, is valued around £7m and highly regarded by his international manager Louis Van Gaal.

He has made eight appearances for the international side and is part of the 30-man preliminary squad for the upcoming World Cup in Brazil.
