BBC and ITV go head-to-head for the first time at this World Cup, as both channels show the showpiece final between Germany and Argentina at the Maracana.

While BBC’s punditry team of Gary Linker, Alan Shearer, Alan Hansen and Rio Ferdinand were suited and booted for the occasion, ITV’s panel were pitched up on Ipanema beach in open-top shirts and shades.

Adrian Chiles, who led ITV’s relaxed team, was joined by Martin O’Neill, Ian Wright, Lee Dixon and Glenn Hoddle by the waterfront.

Dressed up for the occasion: Gary Lineker and his team wore smart suits for BBC's coverage of the final

Smart-casual: ITV's team, meanwhile, wore open-top shirts as they discussed the match on Ipanema beach

With the 
sun still blazing in Brazil, Dixon, Wright and Hoddle needed sunglasses 
to shield their eyes as they discussed Germany and Argentina’s chances 
ahead of kick-off.

Hansen is making his final appearance for the BBC, after 22 years on the screen.

The
 59-year-old moved into punditry after retiring from playing in 1991 and
 during his time with the BBC he worked with presenters and pundits 
including Des Lynam, Lineker and his long-time side-kick Mark Lawrenson.

Fetching: Ferdinand wore a neat double-breasted jacket, while Shearer matched his tie and pocket square

Contrast: Ian Wright in shades and an open-top shirt while Rio Ferdinand wears a suit in BBC's studio

Wind-swept: Hoddle's hair blew in the wind as he spoke about Germany's chances of winning

On
 his BBC departure, Hansen said: ‘Twenty-two years on an iconic 
programme, with the best people working for the best organisation, it 
can't get much better than that.’
