Humanity faces a ‘vortex of economic, socio-political and environmental ills’ unless the world’s richest nations tighten their belts and consume less, according to a report.

A Royal Society panel has concluded that a ‘tipping point’ has been reached and that the very future of humanity is doubt unless developed nations rethink the way they live.

Sir John Sulston, who led the 23-strong group of academics from around the world who produced the report, warned that ‘we are reaching a critical time in the development of humanity on the Earth’ and that continual economic growth ‘is not sustainable’.

Double trouble: The Royal Society says that developed nations consume too much and that the world's population is too high

He said: ‘The human world lives in a framework called global economics. We live in a system based on GDP, which drives consumption. it causes people to compete with each other through trade in a way that they all grow. All governments say: “We must grow.” But it’s not sustainable.

‘The strong evidence is that we’re running out of space. We’re collectively affecting the world’s climate. This is due to the still growing human population and our increase in consumption.’

The report highlights the fact that the world’s population passed seven billion recently and that developing countries will be building the equivalent of a city of a million people every five days from now to 2050.

Food for thought: Some people eat too much than is good for them, while others starve, says Sir John Sulston

Sir John said: ‘The world now has a very clear choice. We can choose to address the twin issues of population and consumption to rebalance the use of resources to a more egalitarian pattern of consumption.

‘Or we choose to do nothing and to drift into a downward vortex of economic, socio-political and environmental ills, leading to a more unequal and inhospitable future.’

He added that some people in the world are consuming far too much food than is good for them, while others starve.
