The world’s leading authority on the detection of banned performance-enhancing drug EPO in blood says a particularly low level of the substance is explicable only by renal damage or doping — a conclusion that raises fresh doubts over historic alleged doping by a current staff member at Team Sky.

As The Mail on Sunday reported last week, court documents in France show that an expert at a 2001 criminal trial concluded from a blood sample taken from a Dutch rider, Servais Knaven, that he had taken artificial EPO.

The toxicology reports that led to testimony that Knaven had taken EPO were compiled by two doctors whose evidence was challenged in court, but the court ruled it was good evidence.

Knaven has been a ‘directeur sportif’ with vital strategic responsibilities at Team Sky since 2011 and was a 27-year-old rider with Dutch team TVM when the sample was taken during the 1998 Tour de France.

Dave Brailsford, former director Sean Yates and Servais Knaven (second right) with Bradley Wiggins in 2012 - a 1998 sample from Knaven showing an EPO level of 0.7 was used to convict traffickers in a French court 

The technical paperwork relating to his blood tests carried out by an expert, Francoise Bressolle, showed an EPO level of 0.7. Team Sky say their own unnamed experts, paid by them to examine documents unearthed by the MoS, have exonerated Knaven of any wrongdoing, for reasons unspecified.

Knaven was never on trial and therefore did not have an opportunity to challenge the medical evidence; rather his tests and testimony were used to convict EPO traffickers. Knaven never disputed the reading of 0.7 but denied ever taking EPO.

Now Robin Parisotto, who invented the first ever blood tests to detect EPO, has told the MoS: ‘The only known causes of such a low EPO level in blood [0.7] is either due to significant renal damage where the kidneys cannot sustain normal production of natural/endogenous EPO and/or the current and previous administration of recombinant [banned] EPO.’

Directeur sportif for Team Sky Knaven signed a police statement in 1998 saying he did not contest the EPO finding. He said he believed it may have been due to ‘great exertion’, which expert Robin Parisotto 

Sky did not answer our specific questions but gave this statement: 

‘This relates to events over 15 years ago that were contested and well documented at the time. 

We looked carefully at the information provided to us by The Mail on Sunday last week, including a review by a panel of three independent world-class experts. 

Nothing here, including the new medical opinion, causes us, or the experts, to change our view. 

There is no proof of Doping. 

Servais Knaven continues to maintain his innocence and to be a valued member of Team Sky.' 

The MoS has asked Knaven and Team Sky if Knaven had renal damage at the 1998 Tour de France. They have not answered.

Parisotto was lead researcher on the pioneering EPO tests, first implemented at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. These tests have morphed into the athlete biological passport and since been adopted by a number of international sporting bodies.

Parisotto also currently sits on the biological passport panel of cycling’s world governing body, the UCI.

In 1998, Knaven signed a police statement saying he did not contest the EPO finding, but said he did not know why it was so low. He told police he believed it may have been due to ‘great exertion’.

Parisotto says: ‘I don’t think that “great exertion” is a plausible explanation for such a low EPO level.’ 

FRENCH COURT DOCUMENTSNo 1:  This is an extract from the court expert’s summary, specifically in relation to Knaven’s blood and his EPO level, saying in her opinion this was a result of the ‘feedback’ phenomenon where the body is now producing such low levels of EPO as it had recently stopped taking artificial EPO. It finishes by saying: ‘Conclusion: Took exogenous EPO.’

No 2: An extract from the official court summary of the case showing expert witness BRESSOLLE had concluded EPO use by four of the TVM riders, from blood samples. Knaven was one of those four. Ouchakov, Blijelevens and Voskamps were the others.

No 3: A summary of an interview, quoting Knaven’s own words, following a police interview on 3 Dec 1998, signed by Servais Knaven to show it is an authentic and accurate representation of what he had said in that interview.

He says: ‘I do not dispute this rate [of 0.7]. On the other hand, if this rate is so low, it can result from lots of things other than stopping taking EPO. At least that is what I’ve heard from lawyers and doctors. I believe these people all the more because I’ve never taken EPO.

‘For my part, although I am not a doctor, I think that this perhaps comes from the fact this is due to an earlier great effort.’ 

No 4: The vital readings that Mrs Bressolle found in Knaven’s blood. The key figure here is the EPO reading in the body: 0.7. This was an abnormally low reading.

Last week we revealed that The Mail on Sunday had unearthed a collection of documents, never published or reported before, containing detail about the involvement of Servais Knaven, Team Sky’s Sporting Director, in one of cycling’s major doping scandals. 

Last week’s revelations came after months of in-depth investigations. 

When we passed our findings to Team SKY, they refused to act. 

Most major cycling teams, including Team Sky, have employed former dopers in the past three years - either as riders, coaches, doctors or all three, and there is no rule against this, but Team Sky have a ‘zero tolerance’ (ZT) policy, meaning that if past doping comes to light, that person must leave. Several Team Sky staff have left after confessions since 2012, but not Knaven.

Question 1 

The world’s leading blood expert on EPO, Robin Parisotto, has examined the paperwork from Reims. Parisotto invented the first blood tests to detect EPO and sits on the biological passport panel of the UCI. He says the testing Francoise Bressolle did on Knaven’s blood remains credible, concluding: ‘The only known causes of such a low EPO level in blood is either due to significant renal damage where the kidneys cannot sustain normal production of natural/endogenous EPO and/or the current and previous administration of recombinant EPO.’

Did Servais Knaven have renal damage at the Tour de France in 1998? If not, what is his own explanation for that EPO reading, which he did not contest as accurate in a signed police statement in 1998?

Question 2 

Servais Knaven’s urine from July 28 1998 showed irregular levels of a banned drug, cortisone. In signed contemporaneous statements he said he ‘did not contest’ the presence in his samples of numerous substances, cortisone included. His explanation was he didn’t know how they got there.

Would Team Sky today, with a zero-tolerance policy, accept the rider’s explanation ‘I don’t know how it got there’ as a valid defence?

Question 3 

Who are the three ‘independent world-class’ experts cited in Team Sky’s statement of March 7 who say the court documents are no proof of doping?

Question 4 

The evidence provided last week by the MoS, and studied by these experts, was accepted as valid in a criminal court case where three defendants were given prison sentences in verdicts, never appealed. On what specific, scientific basis did these three experts reject this evidence?

Question 5 

Dave Brailsford said on The Telegraph’s cycling podcast last week that the experts, paid by Team Sky, did not know Servais Knaven’s name when analysing the papers. Is it true the experts didn’t know the papers related to Knaven? (His name appears across the papers) If so, why not?

Question 6 

Knaven explicitly told police in 1998 he had no medical conditions requiring treatment with prescription drugs, yet admitted use of one prescription drug, Persantin — a blood thinner — and tested positive for another, Naftidrofuryl. The latter is used by heart patients. Knaven said in 1998 he’d never heard of it, but now admits he used it. Why the apparent contradictions?

Question 7 

Team Sky say they were unaware until last week of the contents of the police statements relating to Servais Knaven from 1998 and of various findings during that Tour, including products in his room and system. You now know about the court documents in Reims. Will you go to review them?
