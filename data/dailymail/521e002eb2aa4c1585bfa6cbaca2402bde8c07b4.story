Two fugitives - one of whom is actor Russel Crowe's former helicopter pilot - have finally been caught after years on the run when the yacht they stole in New Zealand was spotted off the coast of Australia by a sailing website who had been trying to find it for the owners.

Sailing website Live Sail Die had been keeping an eye out for the stolen yacht 'Harlech'. After identifying it by taking photographs taken through a pair of binoculars, they alerted police.  

The two fugitives - one an unlicensed helicopter pilot who frequently flew Hollywood star Russell Crowe from Sydney to his outback Australian home - were arrested as they drifted into Broken Bay near Palm Beach, Sydney, on Monday night. 

Crowe's former helicopter pilot Paul James Bennett and partner Simone Anne Wright are accused of fraud, theft and sexual assault on a teenage girl.

Australian actor Russell Crowe employed Bennett as his helicopter pilot in 2000, but was not aware that Bennett did not even have a helicopter licence 

The Daily Telegraph reported that the yacht was taken from the Bay of Islands in New Zealand two weeks ago. Bennett, 52, and Wright, 38, are in a long-term relationship, and are wanted in connection with an alleged AU$240,000 fraud of HeliPower, a Canterbury-based helicopter company. 

They are also wanted in connection of a suspected sex attack on a teenage girl in the late 2000s. Both were detained on the yacht at 9.30pm on Monday night and are assisting police with their enquiries.

'I am extremely pleased with the efforts of our enthusiastic followers which assisted greatly with the capture of two wanted fugitives who stole the yacht Harlech,' Live Sail Die CEO Suellen Hurling said in a statement.

'When the news came about that the boat had been stolen, LSD team member Darren McManaway was assigned the role to manage the updates and communications and to ensure that we kept the momentum going so that the story wasn’t forgotten, or lost in a sea of updates.

'Darren, who also works as a commercial skipper, was tipped off on Monday evening February 17 from one of our young Kiwi readers Felix Fielding, with details that he believed he had spotted the yacht in Sydney. 

'Communications between the two, including photos taken through a pair of binoculars, confirmed that the yacht he could see was in fact the stolen boat. The owners were ecstatic with the find.' 

A reported fantasist who once told a court in Britain in the early 1990s that he had been kidnapped while working as a helicopter pilot for the CIA in South Africa, Bennett's work with Russell Crowe was all too real for the Oscar-winning actor.

Crowe has told police that he hired Bennett after the New Zealander landed a helicopter unannounced on his farm in northern New South Wales in 2000 and asked for a job.

The actor was not aware that Bennett did not even have a helicopter licence, but agreed that the New Zealander could fly him to and from Sydney.

Police in Sydney had fraud charges listed against Bennett in 2003 as a result of his work as a pilot for Russell Crowe but he disappeared and the case never came to court.

Three years earlier, he touched down on Crowe's 240-hectare property at Nana Glen, near Coffs Harbour, and impressed the actor with his 'cheek' so much that he was hired to fly Crowe around.

But Bennett was eventually dismissed after he turned a Christmas party organised by Crowe into a media circus after leaking a rumour that the actor planned to wed movie star Meg Ryan.

He also used a photograph of him and Crowe in a chopper cabin to obtain loans from companies.
