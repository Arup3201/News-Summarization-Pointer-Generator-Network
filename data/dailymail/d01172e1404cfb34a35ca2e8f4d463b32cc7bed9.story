From Greg's Bear, a one-eared teddy that belongs to U2 singer Bono to Rowan Atkinson's unimaginatively named Teddy, photographer Mark Nixon's new book sheds light on a rarely seen side of some of the world's biggest stars.

But Much Loved isn't really about A-list bears. Instead, it's about telling the stories of 65 adored toy companions, old and young, from all over the world.

'It was seeing my son Calum with his Peter Rabbit, how he buried his head into it and squeezed it with delight [that inspired the book],' reveals Nixon.

Companion: Patsy, who belongs to Tom McLoughlin and his son, has been stitched back together many times

'It reminded me of my own Panda when I was a child. So I thought it would make a good exhibition for my studio, which has a gallery space.

'I had a Teddy Day and all my clients brought in their teddies, surprisingly much more adults than children.

'While waiting they would tell my receptionist some funny story or memory about their teddy and so I got her to write them down. I had the exhibition, put them on my site, and it went viral, 6.5m hits in a few months, all over the world.'

Among them is the grumpy looking Pink Teddy, a 24-year-old toy that once lived in the cot of Aisling Hurley and Peter, a  'fifty-something' bear in a stylish knitted tank top that has been with owner Mave O'Connor since the day she was born.

'It’s
[been] very funny to see some
people’s reactions,' adds Nixon of the response to his photos. 'Most 
love [the photos] but some are horrified by the state of some
of the teddies.

'I’ve also met lots of
very angry adults whose parents thought they were doing the right thing by
getting rid of their child’s teddy.'

More youthful bears in the book, include Beary, a striped pajama clad bear who belongs to six-year-old Tom O'Connor Jr.

'Tom turned six in September,' says his mother Sinead [not the singer Sinead O'Connor]. 'When he was born, he got the teddy as a gift from a friend of mine.

'Tom
calls the teddy Beary, and he goes everywhere with him. I always know 
when Tom is tired - I hear him running upstairs to get Beary off his bed
for a cuddle.'

While most of the toys featured in the book were easy to get hold of, according to Nixon, not everyone was quite so willing to part with their teddies - even for a few moments.

'Rowan Atkinson’s [bear] was fairly easy [to get hold of] and Bono’s was the hardest, but only because it took about a year and a half to finally corner him,' says Nixon.

'Normally you’d bump into him here or there in Dublin but typically when you actually want to, he’s nowhere to be seen.

'But once he and Ali [Hewson] knew about it, they couldn’t have been more helpful. It’s getting to the right person is the key.'

Nixon's own bear Panda also makes an appearance in the book and, according to the photographer, now lives in his studio.

Much Loved by Mark Nixon, £10.99, is published by Abrams Image.

From Ted E. Bear, the childhood companion of Pennsylvania reader Lois Graham to the trio of teddies belonging to Lynne Watts that have racked up 150 years between them, the bears owned by MailOnline's readers are just as cute as Mark Nixon's subjects.
