This is the captivating moment that a high-rise building in a Detroit suburb was reduced to a mound of rubble.

Local media report the implosion and collapse in Southfield, Michigan, on the campus of Oakland Community College (OCC), lasted about two minutes.

It temporarily left a thick and billowing cloud of dust cloud hanging over the area.

A series of mini-explosions took place before college graduate Andrea Wilson detonated the main explosion

The building was in sore need of repair, and it was decided destruction was better than restoration

The right to push the detonation button was auctioned on eBay, with the winning bid of £5,100 ($8,000) placed anonymously by two people.

They in turn awarded the right to recent OCC graduate Andrea Wilson, who said it was the best graduation gift she could ask for. 

Ms Wilson told Michigan Live: 'It's something I'll be able to tell my kids one day, that I helped blow up a building.' 

Ms Wilson has said that being the one to detonate the explosion is 'something to tell her kids one day'

And in around two minutes, the 17-storey building was reduced to a cloud of dust and a pile of rubble

'It was exhilarating. It happened real fast. There were a series of explosions and then it all went down all at once.' 

There were a series of mini-explosions that lit the windows of the 17-storey, 250,000-square-foot North Plaza Building, before the final blow.

And in less than two minutes the building was reduced to a pile of rubble.
