Accused: Alan Evans, 35, left, sent a text message to his mistress on his 'secret phone' just hours before his wife Louise, right, died, it is claimed

A cheating husband sent a text message to his mistress on his ‘secret phone’ just hours before throwing his wife to her death down the stairs, a court has heard.

Alan Evans, 35, killed 32-year-old Louise after she found out he was having a fling with teaching assistant Amanda Chadwick, 30, it is claimed.

He tried to make his wife’s death look like a tragic accident by placing a skipping rope next to her body, Worcester Crown Court heard.

An uncoiled hoover lead was also found at the top of the stairs after Mrs Evans's death on either July 9 or 10 last year.

Yesterday, it emerged that Evans, from Kidderminster, Worcestershire, had sent a blank text to Miss Chadwick using his 'secret phone' on the day of his wife's death.

He bought a Virgin SIM card and GBP5 credit at 2.15pm on July 9 and activated it just minutes later, the court heard.

He then sent a blank text to Miss Chadwick, who worked at the school the couple's three children attended, at 2.26pm - causing her to reply 'Who’s this?' four minutes later.

Miss Chadwick sent another text half an hour later with just four question marks.

She confided in a friend that she believed Evans, a welder, had texted her, but that he hadn't replied.

Prosecutor Jonas Hankin QC said Evans had exchanged 'thousands' of texts with the teaching assistant in the months before his wife, a carer, died.

On June 29 last year, Evans texted Miss Chadwick saying: 'I love you baby. No matter how tough stuff gets.

Fatal: Mother-of-three Louise was found dead at the foot of the stairs at their home in Kidderminster, Worcestershire. A skipping rope was found next to her body

'I’m not going anywhere. I’ll be waiting for you always, I give you my word, weeks or months.'[

Around the same time, Evans was also texting his wife - who had moved out of the family home with their three children - claiming he and Miss Chadwick were just friends.

But the court heard Evans, who had been 
married for 12 years, continued to contact Miss Chadwick and spent 41 
minutes chatting to her from a phone box near his home on July 7.

Yesterday, jurors visited the couple’s semi-detached home where Mrs Evans's body was discovered.

Evans denies one count of murder.

The trial, which is expected to take six weeks, continues.
