Texas police have issued a warrant for the missing driver of an armored truck that was found emptied and abandoned Monday, and they have arrested the man's father.

Police are continuing their search for Trent Michael Cook, 24, of Amarillo, who police have charged with first-degree felony theft of more than $200,000, ABC News reports. 

Cook's father, Brian  Hodge, 43, has been arrested in connection with the crime. 

Cook has not been seen since Monday, the same day police found a Rochester Armored Car Co. vehicle  abandoned, its contents stolen, and its engine running, nearly 30 minutes after the vehicle went missing.

Emptied: On Monday, authorities found this Rochester Armored Car Co. abandoned with its contents stolen; Cook, the driver, was nowhere to be found

Authorities have not revealed the contents of the vehicle.

When authorities found the abandoned vehicle  around 7.50am in a vacant lot, the Amarillo Police Department listed Cook as a 'missing/endangered person,' but now, investigators say they have reason to believe Cook was involved in the heist.

'Investigators have developed credible evidence Cook has access to a rifle and handguns, and could be considered dangerous due to this information,' the department said in a statement. 

On Tuesday, police issued the warrant for Cook and arrested Hodge who, they say, tampered with or fabricated evidence involving the case. 

Family: Cook's mother (left) and stepfather, Bill Wills (right) hold that if Cook was involved in any crime involving the vehicle, he was forced to participate against his will

Abandoned: On Monday, police found the armored company vehicle abandoned with its contents emptied nearly 30 minutes after the truck went missing

Cook's family holds that Cook was not voluntarily involved in the heist and that if he did have anything to do with it, it was against his will.

But, investigators have uncovered that Cook discussed with others how a heist like this could be pulled off, according to Fox News. 

On Tuesday evening, authorities even found a white 1995 Ford van in a parking lot which they believe was Cook's getaway vehicle. 

'This recovery indicates that the suspect changed cars in the area early in the day, possibly shortly after the theft,' the department said in a statement, according to Fox.

'It is unknown if he was picked up by another person or if the suspect had pre-positioned a second vehicle at that scene.'

Stepfather: Wills (top right) said that Cook is a former reservist of the U.S. Army and recently quit his job at an Amarillo correctional facility to work for the Rochester Armored Car Co.

Bill Wills, Cook's stepfather told the Huffington Post that Cook is a former reservist of the U.S. Army and recently quit his job at an Amarillo correctional facility to work for the armored car company.

The family told ABC that Cook loved his job and had nothing to do with the crime.

Cook was not armed and authorities believe he was the only employee in the truck at the time, Fox reports.

He is 5 feet 6 inches tall, has blonde hair and hazel eyes, and weighs 165 pounds, according to Fox. He was last seen wearing his Rochester Armored Car Co. uniform.
