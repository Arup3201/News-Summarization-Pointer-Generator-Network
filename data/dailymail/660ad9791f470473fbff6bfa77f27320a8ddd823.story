Real Madrid have opened talks with Monaco over a deal for Radamel Falcao.

The Colombia striker, a firm favourite of Real president Florentino Perez, was a talismanic figure at cross-city rivals Atletico prior to his move to Monaco last summer.

However, he has failed to take to life in the French league and a cruciate ligament injury further compounded his misery.

The move now could impact upon any plans
 for Real Madrid to sign Luis Suarez in this window with Karim Benzema’s
 representatives also in the throes of contract negotiations.

Falcao’s
 agent Jorge Mendes has held informal talks with interested parties in 
England also but Real Madrid are now in pole position with reports in 
France intimating an announcement could be made after the World Cup.

Such
 a deal would leave Barcelona as the frontrunners in the bidding for 
Liverpool’s Suarez this summer. They are looking at selling players to 
help fund the bid and interest is gathering in Alexis Sanchez.

Although
 Juventus have failed so far in their attempts to strike a deal, Arsenal
 are also keen and could be aided by Atletico Madrid’s desire to sign 
Santi Cazorla.

Liverpool have an interest in Sanchez also but have yet to formalise that with an offer.
