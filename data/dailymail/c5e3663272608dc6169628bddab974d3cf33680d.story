Laughable: Andrew Cant, owner of Simply Books, was shocked when he received a cheque for 12p seven years after being a victim of crime

Court officials have been accused of 'judicial overkill' today after spending seven years chasing 12p in compensation from a criminal before handing it to his bemused victim.

Book shop owner Andrew Cant, 58, had no idea he had lost £3 in a sponsorship scam in 2006 - yet investigators were determined he would get his money back.

Although the culprit was jailed in 2006, officials at Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunal Service pored over paperwork relating to the case.

They went through a raft of bogus sponsorship forms signed by Mr Cant and other unwitting victims of serial conman Mark Maskell and then investigated whether the names and addresses on the list of sponsors checked out.

After establishing their identities, they split the amount and made out cheques for 12p to 34 victims - placing first class stamps on each later at a cost of 59p each.

When Mr Cant tried to find out what the money was for, HMCTS went to the expense of sending him another letter apologising for sending him the 12p cheque.

Mr Cant - owner of Simply Books in Bramhall, Cheshire said: 'I can't imagine the waste of public money that has gone into administering the cheque and now sending me a letter to apologise for it.

'The fact is I had forgotten all about losing this money yet these people have spent many man hours sorting out a payment which literally isn't worth the paper it is written on.

'It seems ludicrous. I would happily have written off three pounds and frankly I can't understand all the bother that went into investigating it. The irony is it would cost me more money to cash the cheque than the cheque is actually worth.

Pay-off: This cheque for 12p was the result of years of work by civil servants who were accused of 'judicial overkill' today

Don't spend it all at once: The cost of the stamp used to send it to him was more than the money he received

Funny: 'It was ridiculous to send out a cheque for 12p, especially as it would cost me 63p to cash it,' the book shop owner said

'As far as I'm concerned I'm going to frame it and put it up on the wall of the book shop as an example of judicial overkill. Had I known what the court people were doing I would have told them not to bother for such a small amount of money.'

Criminal: Mark Maskill had scammed dozens of people, claiming he was going to do parachute jumps for good causes and Andrew had sponsored him £3 in 2006

Father of three Mr Cant was one of a number of victims of conman Mark Maskell who scammed dozens of people, claiming he was going to do parachute jumps for good causes - only to pocket the cash.

Mr Cant sponsored Maskell for £3 in 2006 after the conman came into his shop falsely claiming he was raising money for a homeless charity.

Maskell was later jailed for four months later that year after admitting deception but Macclesfield magistrates ordered he pay compensation to his victims.

'The whole thing is just laughable. It was ridiculous to send out a cheque for 12p, especially as it would cost me 63p to cash it,' Mr Cant said.

It is understood that court officers chased the compensation ordered by magistrates and whatever money was recovered was split equally between victims.

It is not not known why it took so long for the money to come through.

A spokesman for Her Majesty's Courts and Tribunal Service said: 'HMCTS uses all means at its disposal to ensure compensation ordered by the court is paid.

'Normally payments are not sent to victims until a minimum of £5 has been collected. The 12p cheque was issued in error. HMCTS has apologised to the individual concerned.'

Sorry! The letter sent to Andrew apologising for sending him the tiny amount and explaining they always try to track down compensation for victims

Maskell, now 30, was jailed four times - for four months in 2006, another four months in 2007, 16 months in 2008 and a further four months in February 2010.

He would knock on the doors of the victims, claimed he was doing parachute jumps or sponsored swims to raise money for The Wellspring homeless charity in Stockport or the British Heart Foundation.

He was caught for the sixth time in 2011 after being shopped by his sister for pretending to take part in a sponsored swim - but was given a 12-month community order with 200 hours of unpaid work and a three-month electronically tagged evening curfew.

It emerged he had carried out the fraud to fund an addiction to heroin.
