The airspace Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 was flying in when it was shot down was not restricted, but airlines had been warned about the potential dangers, it has emerged.

The International Transport Association said that an initial assessment revealed that the airspace the aircraft was travelling through was 'not subject to restrictions'.

The Malaysian Airlines flight lost contact with aircraft control when it was flying over eastern Ukraine. Nine Britons and 27 Australians, according to Dutch authorities, and fears of up to 23 Americans are among the 295 that have lost their lives.

The Geneva-based group said in a statement: 'Based on the information currently available, it is believed that the airspace that the aircraft was traversing was not subject to restrictions.'

Following the Malaysian Airlines crash aircraft approaching the Crimea diverted to the north and south

The Boeing 777 was flying just 300 metres above restricted airspace when it was shot down.

Ukrainian authorities had barred aircraft from ground level to 32,000 feet but the downed aircraft was cruising at 33,000 feet, still within range of  ground-to-air missiles, when it was hit.

There was speculation that the doomed Flight MH17 had taken a short-cut across the disputed region of eastern Ukraine to save fuel.

As relatives gathered at airports for news of missing loved ones, it emerged that airlines had twice been warned about the risk of flying over an area where two Ukrainian military aircraft hadalready been shot down this week.

In April, the International Civil Aviation Organisation advised carriers to consider alternative routes after outlining ‘the possible existence of serious risks to the safety of international civilflights’.

On Monday, Eurocontrol – the body that coordinates all traffic across European airspace – sent out an official note to airmen,known as a Notam, repeating the warning and saying it ‘stronglyadvises’ avoiding the airspace.

But many carriers continued to use the route because it was shorter and therefore cheaper.

Flight MH17 had taken off from Amsterdam at lunchtime and was flying at around 33,000ft on one of the main routes from Europe.

The jet was travelling at 33,000 feet at 490 knots when it disappeared from radar screens while approaching the Russian border.

It
 is believed that the Malaysian Airlines pilots ignored several warnings
 to avoid the airspace over Ukraine. It is understood the Malaysian 
Airline jet used the Ukrainian route to save fuel as diverting north or 
south would have taken longer.

Earlier on Thursday, air 
accident investigators were planning to inspect the proposed flight plan 
lodged by pilots on board Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 to see if they 
flew over a warzone as a cost-cutting measure.

The
 17-year-old jet was shot down over eastern Ukraine despite British, 
European and U.S. commercial aircraft being warned against using the 
airspace since April.

One
 aviation expert revealed: 'Malaysia Airlines, like a number of other 
carriers, have been continuing to use it because it is a shorter route, 
which means less fuel and therefore less money.'

In April, the European Aviation and Safety Agency warned: ‘Taking into consideration the recent publication by the Russian Federation of a series of notices to airmen (NOTAMs) modifying the Simferopol FIR which is under the responsibility of Ukraine, and their intent to provide air traffic services (ATS) within this airspace, the Agency draws the aviation communities’ attention to the possible existence of serious risks to the safety of international civil flights.

‘Due to the unsafe situation where more than one ATS provider may be controlling flights within the same airspace from 3 April 2014, 0600 UTC onwards, consideration should be given to measures to avoid the airspace and circumnavigate the Simferopol FIR with alternative routings. ‘

On July 8, the State Aviation Administration of Ukraine closed its airspace to civilian aircraft after rebels shot a military transport aircraft that was flying over 20,000 feet.

The restriction warned commercial aircraft against using Ukranian airspace.

A Notice to Airmen, seen by Mail Online warned: ‘Due to the potential for conflicting air traffic control (ATC) instructions from Ukrainian and Russian authorities and for the related potential for misidentification of civil aircraft, UK aircraft  operators are strongly advised to avoid, until further notice, the airspace over Crimea, the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov.’

The EASA supplied airlines with a list of alternative routes avoiding the conflict zone.

The U.S. Federal Aviation Authority had also banned its aircraft from the Crimea region.

The suspected shooting down of a large passenger plane while flying at altitude presents airlines and their passengers with an extremely serious new development in air travel, according to aviation experts.

The European Air Safety Authority issued airlines with a number of alternative routes avoiding Ukraine 

European and US air safety bodies warned against using Ukrainian airspace since April because of the risk 

Norman Shanks, the former head of group security at airports group BAA, and professor of aviation security at Coventry University, said there had been suggestions airlines had been warned to avoid the route because of the violence below.

But many carriers continued to use it because it was shorter and therefore cheaper. 

He said: 'It is a busy aviation route and there have been suggestions that a notice was given to aviators telling airlines to avoid that particular area.

'But Malaysia Airlines, like a number of other carriers, have been continuing to use it because it is a shorter route, which means less fuel and therefore less money.

'I expect the area will be declared a no fly zone and aircraft will have no choice but to take a different, longer route.'

Airline carriers are avoiding the area where the passenger aircraft crashed, as well as the east of Ukraine in the wake of the tragedy.

Russian Aeroflot, UTair and Transaero, German Lufthansa, Turkish airlines, Italy's Alitalia and America's Delta have diverted all their planes away from the strife-hit region.

'After the incident we have decided to avoid Ukrainian airspace,' a Turkish Airlines spokesman said.

Air France and Virgin have also decided to temporarily re-route flights to bypass Ukraine, according to RT.

Delta tweeted: 'Out of an abundance of caution, Delta is not routing flights through Ukrainian airspace.'

Prof Shanks said it was 'extremely unusual' for political disputes to spill over and endanger the lives of civilians travelling in commercial flights in the skies above.

And he suggested those behind the shooting 'deliberately' targeted a passenger plane as it would have been obvious from its appearance that it was a commercial aircraft and posed no military threat.

He said: 'This is probably the first time this has happened in recent history. The aircraft was flying at such a height that it is unlikely to have been a military aircraft.

'You would be able to tell it was a civilian aircraft not a military aircraft with the naked eye because of the jet plumes behind it.

'This would almost certainly have to be a deliberate act, for whatever reason - we can only speculate.

'It should have been quite visible to people on the ground that it was a civilian aircraft, by the size of it and the shape of it. Anyone who has looked at a civilian aircraft or large military aircraft will know the difference.'

He said the plane's black box could contain vital clues to help piece together what the pilots knew during their final moments in the cockpit.

But he warned that tracing the flight recorders could be very tricky as they are probably 'now in a war zone' somewhere in the Ukraine.

He added: 'The pilots and passengers could well have been totally unaware that this missile was heading for them.'

Aviation experts fear that MH17 used the route through Ukraine as it was shorter and saved fuel 

If today's incident is confirmed as a deliberate act then Ukraine airspace could well be closed down, meaning diversions for UK carriers who currently fly to and over the area.

‘This could be a very serious development,’ said David Kaminski-Morrow, air transport editor of Flightglobal magazine.

He went on: ‘If reports are true, we are not talking about small-arm fire but serious weaponry. Normally even if planes fly over a war zone they can go high enough for the conflict not to be a worry.

‘Any decision about the opening or closing of Ukranian airspace will be a matter for the Ukrainians. It could well be that part or all of that airspace will now be closed.

‘Also, individual airlines, including UK carriers, could decide to detour around Ukraine.’

Mr Kaminski-Morrow continued: ‘It's really quite incredible that it should be Malaysia Airlines involved in this, after what happened earlier in the year.

‘This is not a small airline on a faraway route. This was a major airline flying from a European destination to a capital in the Far East. There must be serious concerns about how the airline can recover from this.

‘There will obviously be political as well as aviation concerns from all this. This will run and run.’
