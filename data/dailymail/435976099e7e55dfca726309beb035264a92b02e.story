George North  brushed off his three-week lay-off through concussion, saying rugby will always have more risks than ‘table tennis or tiddlywinks’.

The 22-year-old Wales winger, who will become the youngest player to win 50 caps when he faces France in Paris on Saturday night, has been sidelined after suffering two head injuries during the defeat by England in the opening fixture of the RBS 6 Nations.

His record achievement has crept up amid a cloud of debate about concussion, but the Northampton winger does not bear any grudges about the high-profile incidents.

‘At the end of the day it’s rugby, isn’t it?’ said North. ‘It’s not table tennis or tiddlywinks, it’s a contact sport and you are going to get some bangs. Unfortunately they were all on my chin.

‘It’s nice to be back in the squad and involved again. It has been a few weeks of hard work, ticking the boxes and taking my welfare into account, which is what happened from minute one.’

Criticism was levelled at the team doctors after they failed to notice a second-half collision and subsequently allowed North to stay on the pitch. It sparked debate about the safety of the sport and coach Warren Gatland decided to leave the youngster out of his side to face Scotland.

North discovered during a meeting with medical manager Prav Mathema that he suffered a third potential impact, but he was still left feeling frustrated by his omission for the Murrayfield victory.

‘When you are a player at this level, the greatest honour you can get is to play for your country,’ said North. ‘I was passing all the tests and I was symptom-free. I was up for selection so your initial thoughts when not picked are that you are gutted.

‘The neurologist reckons I had a third blow from falling from 6ft 5in to the deck like a floppy sausage and it wasn’t really worth pushing it. In hindsight it was the right decision, but at the time I was like, “arghh!"’

He will be hoping to vent that frustration through his performance at the Stade de France. Including his three Lions caps, North will become the most junior player to reach the 50-Test mark, eclipsing Australia’s Joe Roff, who reached the milestone when he was 24.

A special pair of boots have been commissioned for the occasion and North intends to hang them on the wall alongside those from his first Test in 2010. ‘For me it was never a case of 50 or 100 caps,’ said North. ‘It was always about being in that jersey once, then anything more is a bonus.

‘I’m obviously super-proud to achieve it and hopefully I can keep my head down and get to my Welsh 50. I kept my first-cap boots, my Lions boots and I’ll probably keep these boots as well. You keep your jerseys, too — hopefully my mum hasn’t thrown any of them out!’

His mother will be among the crowd in Paris  to watch her son. The 17st 2lb speedster has a promising record against Les Bleus — two tries in his two previous appearances — but is not expecting a repeat of 2013, when his father earned himself cult status by running on to the pitch to celebrate North’s 71st-minute try.

‘I’ve ordered tickets for my family but my old man is up the top,’ joked North. ‘My mam and sister are at the front but my dad is in the top right-hand corner. If I score and he manages to get down from there, I’ll be impressed!’

With or without his father, North will certainly celebrate if he crosses the whitewash. Having scored just one try in his last six Wales appearances, the national coaches are demanding more from the former Scarlet.

His club form is much better — 11 tries in 15 appearances this season — and Gatland has told the wideman that he must look for more touches on the ball.

‘It’s obvious to see,’ said North. ‘I’ve been very happy with my club form over the past few weeks but I’ve just not been able to get into my groove for my country.

‘The England game was a step forward from the autumn series and the summer tour for me. I missed the Scotland game but hopefully this will be the next step back on to that track.’
