Some of the world's most famous musicians have been brought back to life in an art collection made up of 6,500 CDs.

Artists Mirco Pagano and Moreno De Turco, from Milan, Italy, have created collages of musicians including Elvis Presley, Jimi Hendrix, Freddie Mercury, James Brown and Bob Marley.

Mr Pagano, 29, and Mr De Turco, 25, used CD covers released by each singer to piece together the images.

Mirco Pagano and Moreno De Turco used more than 6,500 CDs to create a series of portraits of famous 
musicians, such as Elvis

The images were pieced together using CD covers released by each singer (above, Jimi Hendrix)

The pair produced a video of Michael Jackson using 1,100 CDs

The duo even made a video of pop king Michael Jackson using 1,100 of his CDs to make him move.

Mr Pagano said: 'We worked for 200 hours over three months to finish the collection.'

'After picking our musicians, we found their most memorable image.'

'We looked through their original CD covers and made a rough composition before printing enough copies of each CD cover onto blank discs.'

'Then we composed each portrait on the floor and took these pictures of them.'

The collages, such as this one of Queen singer Freddie Mercury, were composed on the floor

Mr Pagano and Mr De Turco created the collection to highlight the damage caused by music piracy.

Mr De Turco said: 'We are music lovers and wanted to do something memorable against music piracy.'

'Piracy, like a virus, infects and destroys the music from the inside and prevents the artists from succeeding and become idols like they did in the past.'

'Our copies represent the pirate CD and we hope it makes people take notice.'

The duo's Piracy collection was on show in an exhibition in Milan but they they now arrange private viewings.
