A mother feels 'absolutely mortified' after she discovered a live frog in a bag of washed salad she bought from a high-end supermarket.

Christina Carrington, 50, had already eaten some of the salad leaves before her youngest daughter, Daniela Toale, noticed the amphibian lurking in the bag.

The frog had survived despite being trapped in the plastic packaging for more than 24 hours.

'Mortified': Christina Carrington found this frog in a bag of washed salad she bought from Waitrose

Hiding: The frog was found in a bag of mixed leaf salad which Mrs Carrington had already eaten from

Mrs Carrington, a health care manager from Chandler’s Ford near Southampton, Hampshire, bought the mixed leaf bag from her local branch of Waitrose.

She ate some of the leaves for her lunch, but the green and brown frog was only spotted when Miss Toale, a 20-year-old university student, prepared dinner that evening.

Mrs Carrington said: 'I’m absolutely mortified to think I ate the leaves at lunch time when clearly the frog had been in the same bag.

'I feel repulsed.'

Mrs Carrington said she was 'not sure what to do' with the frog and decided to keep it in the fridge for another night before arranging for it to be collected by supermarket staff.

A spokesman from Waitrose, said: 'We are very sorry for the distress caused.

'All our bagged salad is thoroughly washed and we have steps in place to check each product before packaging.

'Although this is an isolated incident, we’re investigating with our suppliers as to how this happened.

'We are also taking steps to minimise the chances of this happening again.'

The spokesman added that the frog was 'fine' and the supermarket chain was seeking advice from the RSPCA on finding it a suitable home.
