In the moments before Chelsea take on Shrewsbury in the Capital One Cup, Jose Mourinho will switch his attention away from preparing his team.

He will greet 11-year-old Shrews fan Lloyd Burton, who was once a promising player but is now in a wheelchair having undergone chemotherapy on a brain tumour diagnosed in May last year.

Manager Micky Mellon describes local youngster Lloyd as the club’s ‘most famous’ supporter after appearing alongside David Beckham on the recent Stand Up To Cancer fundraising programme on Channel 4.

As part of a scheme to involve children from the community in the club, Lloyd applied colour to a paint-by-numbers portrait of Mourinho, which the Portuguese will sign before kick-off.

It will then be auctioned to raise money so Lloyd, who may never walk again, can have his quality of life boosted with a lift installed in his house and a wet room so he can bathe comfortably.

‘We’re going to sell it for £1million, aren’t we Lloyd?’ beamed Mellon as he greeted Tuesday night’s mascot.

Lloyd was scouted by Manchester United, the club his dad supports, as well as Aston Villa before his cancer took hold.

‘We did it to try to connect with the community again,’ Mellon added. ‘It’s important that this football club represents the community.

‘I love football, and I know the impact it can have on people’s lives. In the past, we haven’t done enough. Nobody had been to meet Lloyd before.’
