Kids' footwear brand Stride Rite has been slammed by parents for ‘forcing’ gender roles on children.

An advert for its Star Wars collection shows a boy brandishing a lightsaber along with the strapline 'the power of Darth Vader' while a blonde-haired girl in a princess outfit models the Disney range.

Margot Magowan, a mother of three girls from San Francisco, explains on her blog Reel Girl that she was 'saddened' by the company's stereotypical marketing strategy.

She says that it heavily influences her daughters and 'their choices become more limited as they repeatedly see that girls are supposed to be so radically different than boys, only wear certain colors, and behave in a certain “feminine” way.'

'Please tell me why Stride Rite markets shoes to little kids as if girls and boys are completely different species,' she adds.

She also says that the way boys and girls are directed to different sides of the store is 'manipulative and destructive'.

Meanwhile Rebecca Hains, who has two young sons, says that she first noticed the company's gender-based approach last year.

After walking into her local store in Massachusetts she saw bright pink posters pasted around the girls' section bearing the motto 'sparkle with every step.'

In contrast, the adverts around the boys' department were 'active', 'energetic' and 'powerful', featuring superhero characters such as Spiderman. 

The children’s media specialist adds on her blog rebeccahains.com that after reviewing Stride Rite's website she found 'more of the same'.

'Girls are meant to be looked at, so their play shoes are a route to prettiness, while boys are meant to be active, so their play shoes are made for play.'

Dozens of customers have now posted on Stride Rite’s Facebook page asking it to ‘stop stereotyping’.

Responding to the backlash a spokesperson for the retailer told MailOnine: 'Customer feedback regarding our stores and advertising is important to us and we are taking it into consideration.'

Stride Rite isn't the only company to face criticism. Disney, Lego and Barbie have all been pressured by consumers to make products that are more gender-neutral.

Research by Elizabeth Sweet, a doctoral candidate in sociology at the University of California, revealed that gender segregating and stereotyping of toys is getting worse.

Writing in the New York Times last year, she said: 'We've made great strides toward gender equity over the past 50 years, but the world of toys looks a lot more like 1952 than 2012.'

She highlighted that boys are encouraged to play with mechanical toys and science kits while for girls it's all about dolls.

However, some believe gender role behaviors develop naturally, regardless of what toys children play with.

Indeed, ifoughtthelaw writes on Jezebel.com in response to an article addressing the Stride Rite adverts: 'What's so strange is that a lot of little girls really gravitate towards the girly stuff. I am keeping all the princessy stuff far, far away from my daughter.

'I am not exactly dressing her in all boys clothes but I don't dress her overly pink and girly either.

'If it was up to me, she would always wear the most comfy, most sensible shoes but she LOVES girly shoes . . . those are all she wants to wear.

'She is only two and has never watched a princess movie. We are all about Sesame Street and Monsters Inc here and she wants to wear nothing but dresses and ballerina gear. Crazy.'
