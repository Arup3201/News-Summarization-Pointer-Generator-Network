Sometimes one has to wonder if too much sun is baking
Floridians’ brains.

A Florida road sign spelled the state’s name wrong, not
once, but twice.

To make matters even worse, the sign spelling the state’s
name wrong twice was actually for an exit to two separate colleges – Florida State
College and the University of North Florida. Perhaps the person(s) who made the sign would benefit from an English course or two.

The sign somehow made it out onto I-95 near Jacksonville,
FL, according to Fox Orlando.

But wait! There’s more! The state department of
transportation blamed the spelling error on an out-of-state contractor,
according to the station, whose news anchors expressed outrage over Florida
having road signs made out of state and said that raises more questions than
the one it answered.

This isn’t the only road sign spelling error discovered this week.

A road sign west of Philadelphia, PA spelled the name of a
town hilariously wrong. Spelled Ephrata, the exit for the town off a local
highway reads ‘Epharta. The town’s name is routinely spelled wrong, according
to NBC Philadelphia. At least in this instance the sign was made in-state, by
the state department of transportation, according to the station.

Both signs will be replaced, according to reports.

This is the second time Florida State College has found its
way into the national spotlight in recent memory. Last month a student at the school
made national headlines after demanding a change to a policy prohibiting her
from breastfeeding her infant on-campus during a final exam.
