When Candace Frazee began to affectionately nickname her then-boyfriend Steve Lubanski 'Hunny Bunny', an obsession was born.

Steve bought Candace a pet rabbit as a token of their love the next Valentine's Day and the couple began exchanging bunny-themed gifts on a daily basis.

They have now amassed an astonishing 28,500 items - a Guinness World Record - and opened a museum for all things rabbit at their home in Pasadena, California.

Vast collection: Steve and Candace have amassed the world's largest collection of rabbit memorabilia

Can't say goodbye: The California couple are so obsessed with rabbits that they keep their dead pet rabbits in the freezer until they can afford to have then freeze-dried

But the couple's obsession spreads further than novelty nick-nacks.

Alongside tubs of ice cream and their wedding cake, the couple keep their dead pet rabbits in the freezer.

Steve and Candace can't bear to part with their pet rabbits after they've died and keep them in the freezer until they can afford to have them freeze-dried at $500 a time.

As a surprise gift for their 19th wedding anniversary, Candace secretly took one of the dead rabbits - called Garetta - from the freezer and sent it off to the company that freeze-dries the corpses, ready to present to him as a romantic gift over dinner.

Romantic nickname: The couple's obsession began when Candace gave her then-boyfriend the affectionate name 'Hunny Bunny' while they were dating

Handle with care: As well as stuffed toys, furniture and even toiletries, the couple have a vast array of china rabbits

Well-behaved: The couple say that their real pet rabbits roam free around the house because they are litter trainedÂ 

The couple, who have been featured on new entertainment channel TLC's programme My Crazy Obsession, opened the museum at their home in 1998 and say that they attract visitors from all over the world.

Most of their home is decked out in rabbit-related furnishings, including the light fittings, kitchenware and toiletries.

As well as the 28,500 rabbit items, the couple also have real rabbits that do not live in cages and are apparently litter-trained roaming free around the house.

Rebecca Chulew from Texas is also featured on My Crazy Obsession because of her all-consuming love of Barbie dolls.

She was bought her first doll at the age of seven by her mother Margot and even had a special custom doll made up to look like her mother in her favourite photograph when she died in 2007.

Rebecca looks set to pass the obsession on to her 15-month-old daughter Veronica as she has custom dresses made at a cost of $300 a time to match different Barbie outfits.

She even goes to the hairdressers once a week and takes a different Barbie along as inspiration for her new hair style.

Rebecca has amassed 500 vintage Barbie dolls thought to be worth around $80,000.

The young mother also scours recycling plants looking for discarded Barbies to restore.

She has added around 8,000 to her collection over several years.

Home business: The couple opened their rabbit museum back in 1998 and say that it attracts visitors from all over the world

Keepsake: The couple's collection includes bags of real rabbit fur

Nick-nacks: Some of the items on display at the museum are more expensive than others

Work cut out: Candace has a long job on her hands keeping the exhibits dust free

But of all the items on show at the museum, the one that is said to attract the most attention is an Elvis rabbit.

The couple say that while rabbits like Roger Rabbit are only known in certain cultures, the popularity of Elvis transcends cultures.

My Crazy Obsession follows people whose fondness for objects has turned into an obsession, and reveals the effort needed to maintain these passions.

The Best family from Las Vegas claim to be the world's strongest family and will also appear on My Crazy Obsession.

Nick and Callie Best, their 11-year-old son Dylan and even five-year-old daughter Jessica are all obsessed with working out in the $80,000 gym they have built in the garage of their home after they were banned from three local gyms.

Between them, the family of four spend a staggering 240 hours a week in the gym and eat ten dozen eggs a week.

Strong: Despite only being aged 11, Dylan can already deadlift 14lbs

Nick and Callie, who are both regular competitors at strong man and strong woman contests, met at a competition and have passed their fitness obsession onto their two children.

Already Dylan can deadlift 140lbs despite his young age and five-year-old Jessica can lift more than double her body weight already.

As well as working out in the gym, the family sling huge tyres down the street.

Nick, who eats an astonishing 10,000 to 15,000 calories a day also pulls a truck weighed down with family and neighbours along the street once a week.
