Sir Peter Morrison at Downing Street: A man has come forward with allegations that the former aide to Margaret Thatcher raped him when he was 14

One of Margaret Thatcher’s closest aides raped a boy of 14 but escaped justice after police lied about prosecuting him, it was claimed yesterday.

Scotland Yard is investigating fresh claims that former Tory MP Sir Peter Morrison abused the teenager at the notorious Elm Guest House linked to an alleged VIP paedophile ring.

Yesterday the alleged victim’s father said he allowed the boy to go with the barrister – later Lady Thatcher’s parliamentary private secretary and Conservative Party deputy chairman – because he ‘seemed nice’.

Hours after the reported attack in 1982, the father phoned police who arranged for the boy to be medically examined. But the father claims Scotland Yard lied, telling him his son’s attacker had been jailed.

The alleged victim, now 46 and a married businessman, is the first to publicly accuse the Chester MP who died in 1995 aged 51. Morrison – first linked to child abuse in 1998 – was never charged.

Now the unnamed man is preparing to take legal action against Scotland Yard, which he claims ‘hushed the whole thing up’.

He says he was yards from his home in Harting, West Sussex when he met the MP. He said Morrison offered him money if he would help him restart his car and then invited him to his ‘nice big house in London for the weekend’.

The alleged victim told the Sunday Telegraph: ‘He wore a pin-striped suit and was very well dressed, so I didn’t think anything was wrong. I suppose I was quite impressed, in a way.’ He later agreed to go with Morrison after the MP phoned him repeatedly.

The boy’s father also recalled meeting the politician, saying: ‘The guy said he had homes in Chester and London, but he never told us he was an MP. He seemed nice – very well spoken and nicely presented. I allowed my son to go … I suppose you just trusted people more in those days.’

But when the chauffeur-driven car set off, his son claims Morrison began sexually assaulting him.

‘Before long, he had my trousers off … we stopped for petrol, and I thought about running out of the car,’ he said. ‘But … the doors had some sort of child lock and I couldn’t get out. I was so frightened.’

Morrison allegedly plied him with beer and wine before taking him to a house he believes was the Elm Guest House in Barnes.

‘I was assaulted and raped for … at least an hour,’ he said. ‘It was the most horrendous experience of my life … he told me I’d be sleeping in his bed that night.’ The alleged victim said the MP told him they would take a sauna together before a ‘party’. But he managed to escape and take a train home where he told his father what had happened.

Confidant: Morrison with Baroness Thatcher. He was her parliamentary private secretary when she was PM

House of abuse: Sir Peter, who was Thatcher's parliamentary private secretary, allegedly lured the 14-year-old from Sussex to the now notorious Elm Guest House in Barnes, south west London, where he raped him

He was taken to a police doctor in Bognor Regis the next day who confirmed the boy had ‘certainly been sexually abused’. Two Scotland Yard detectives allegedly took a statement. But the family claim they received no paperwork and say officers took nearly a year to return the boy’s clothing.

The father said: ‘They told me the guy had been convicted at a court in Chelsea and that he’d been sent to prison for two years … I did think it was odd that my son hadn’t been called to give evidence but … I thought that was the end of that and we could start to forget about the whole thing.’

Years later, the alleged victim recognised Morrison as an MP and learned he had not been convicted.

The man said: ‘Either the police were paid off or they hushed it up because he was an MP. I was never the same … he ruined my life.’

A Scotland Yard spokesman was unable to say whether Morrison had been investigated at the time, but said Operation Fairbank – set up to examine child abuse allegations involving high-profile figures – was looking into the claims.
