A woman who claims doctors failed to diagnose her terminal cancer 16 times, raised £35,000 to fund treatment in Germany as she prepares to take legal action against the NHS.

Leigh Naylor was distraught when medics revealed they had found cervical tumour, giving her nine months to live in March.

The 32-year-old raised £35,000 to fund treatment in Germany, after doctors in the UK said all they could offer was a course of life-prolonging chemotherapy.

After three weeks of treatment, Ms Naylor said her tumour has shrunk and she is starting to show signs of recovery.

But she has been forced to return to the UK after her money ran out, and is trying to raise a further £12,000 for each course of treatment, which she may need for the rest of her life.

Mrs Naylor, from Ripon, North Yorkshire, said: ‘I didn't trust the NHS when they said there was nothing they could do but prolong my life by a couple of months because they told me I was dying before and I survived.

‘They also misdiagnosed my cancer as fibroids and a urine infection. They were quick to write me off but I felt fit and healthy and wanted to do anything to stay alive.

‘A friend told me about the clinic in Germany and after researching the treatment, I was hopeful it would save my life.

‘It's not right that I have had to pay for my own treatment, but I do not feel I have any choice because the NHS has repeatedly let me down.

‘I know the odds are stacked against me, but I will do anything I can to try and get through this.’

Mrs Naylor claims that the reason why she was not given the scan straight way is because it was ‘too expensive’.

‘But I would be in a completely different position now if they'd detected the tumour earlier,’ she said. ‘I refuse to accept this death sentence.’

Mrs Naylor visited her GP with irregular bleeding in April 2009 and saw her doctor 16 times in the space of 18 months.

She claims she was only given tablets to stop the bleeding.

Mrs Naylor said an ultrasound scan revealed she had fibroids - non-cancerous tumours around the 
womb.

Just
 three weeks after a routine operation to remove the fibroids, doctors at Leeds'
 St James Hospital admitted they had failed to spot a cancerous tumour, Mrs Naylor claimed.

Following
 treatment, the 32-year-old  was given the all-clear in April 2010, but in 
September 2012, she went back to doctors complaining of further pain.

But she said doctors sent her away with antibiotics.

Once more, she asked for a scan and seven months of tests revealed that the cancer had returned and was inoperable.

Mrs
 Naylor and her husband Stuart, 33, were told that radiotherapy was not 
an option and were only offered life-extending chemotherapy.

She raised £35,000 to have the disease treated at Marinus Clinic in Brannenburg, Germany, and after just three weeks, the tumour has shrunk and Mrs Naylor (pictured during treatment) is showing signs of recovery. The treatment involved heating the body to kill cancer cells while undergoing vitamin C injections

She was a given just nine months to live in March this year.

Refusing
 to accept the outcome, Mrs Naylor raised £35,000 to travel to Marinus 
Clinic in Brannenburg, Germany, where she had three weeks of treatment, 
involving heating the body to kill cancer cells while undergoing vitamin
 C injections to boost her immune system.

‘As well as donations, I held a Robbie Williams tribute night because I'm his biggest fan,’ she said.

'No one wants to be told they're dying,' said Mrs Naylor (pictured) doing the Race for Life

‘I also organised an auction, dinner, dance, raffle, family fun day and sponsored walk to raise the cash.

‘I was worried we weren't going to raise it in time but luckily everyone was so generous. It was such a relief.

‘No one wants to be told they're dying and I wasn't prepared to be dosed up with morphine and wires and lay down and die at 32.’

German doctors told Mrs Naylor that she is responding well to treatment and hope that the tumour will continue to shrink.

‘It's amazing, not only has the tumour got smaller but the tissue has got softer and the cancer in one of my lymph nodes has a hole in it - which means it's dying,’ Mrs Naylor said.

‘I still have a long way to go, but it's a good start. I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for my husband and my friends.

‘They have done more for me than the NHS ever did. I feel totally let down and I've lost all my trust in UK medicine.

'As a taxpayer, I shouldn't have to raise money to save my own life.’

She is raising money for the next stage of her treatment and people can donate money by visiting her website.

Mrs Naylor is now launching legal action against the NHS.

A St James' Hospital spokesman said: ‘We are aware of the patient's concerns and are actively engaged in a process to address these.

'We would like to pass on our best wishes for her future treatment.

‘We have reviewed the patient's records in detail and can evidence that the patient was reviewed in a timely manner on a number of occasions.

‘All relevant investigations, including scans, were arranged as a matter of priority. At no time have we refused any requests for scans or treatment.’

Julia Rogers, 58, (pictured) from Newton Abbot in Devon, said she only found out she had inoperable pancreatic cancer after she paid £600 for a scan at a private hospital

A terminally ill woman claims NHS doctors failed to diagnose her pancreatic cancer, despite 19 appointments.

Julia Rogers, 58, from Newton Abbot in Devon, said she only found out she had an inoperable pancreatic tumour after she went to a private hospital and paid £600 for a scan.

NHS England has launched an inquiry to determined what happened.

In September 2013, Ms Rogers went to her GP complaining of severe back pain, which she said felt like it was spreading to her abdomen.

She had blood tests and was later sent for an ultrasound at Totnes Community Hospital, but nothing unusual was seen on the scan.

She told the BBC’s Sally Mountjoy: ‘I still knew something was very wrong. I could not get any of the doctors to take me seriously.'

Ms Rogers was referred to an appointment with a gastroenterologist but decided she could not wait several weeks and paid £600 to have a scan at a private hospital in Bristol.

On June 11 she was told she had ‘inoperable advanced pancreatic cancer’.

She was admitted to hospital over the weekend and expects to undergo treatment this week.

In a statement, NHS England said: ‘We are very sorry to hear about Ms Rogers’ diagnosis and the difficulties she seems to have encountered over an extended period.

‘This clearly calls for thorough investigation on behalf of all NHS organisations involved.
