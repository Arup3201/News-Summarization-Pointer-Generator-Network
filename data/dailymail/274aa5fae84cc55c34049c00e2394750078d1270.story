Saving: Chancellor George Osborne said he was taking action to curb rises in the cost of motoring and catching the train

Fuel duty will not rise before the general election and an inflation-busting rail fare rise has been scrapped in a bid to cut the cost of getting to work.

George Osborne found £750million to cancel a 2p-a-litre rise in fuel due next September.

And rail fares will rise at 3.1 per cent in the New Year in line with inflation, instead of the 4.1 per cenr commuters were told to prepare for.

Mr Osborne said he wanted to help 
struggling families in a meaningful way by reducing scrapping all of the
 rises which the last government had planned over several years.

Mr
 Osborne told MPs: ‘Next year’s fuel duty rise will be cancelled. 
Instead of petrol taxes going up by 2 pence a litre, they will stay 
frozen.

‘That means 
compared to the previous government’s plans, petrol will be 20 pence a 
litre less. That’s £11 less every time you fill up. A saving for drivers
 over this Parliament of £680.’

He went on: ‘We’re helping those who drive a car and we’re helping those who get the train too.‘For fares next January were due to go up by 1 per cent above inflation.

‘We are going to keep average fares flat in real terms.’

The fuel duty freeze is one of the key 
measures Mr Osborne unveiled to counter Labour’s challenge that the 
coalition is failing to act on the cost of living crisis.

In addition to scrapping the rise planned for September 2014, the Chancellor also ruled out any further rises before May 2015.

Mr Osborne will then have frozen duty for four years in total, at a cost to the Treasury of £22billion.

In the last decade the cost of petrol at the pump has risen from 74.6p to 130.25p.

Under Labour fuel duty rose from 45.82p per litre in June 2003 to 57.19p by the time of the 2010 election.

Petrol prices have risen sharply in the last decade, but Chancellor George Osborne said he was determined to hold down fuel duty until the general election in 2015

Under rises set out by Labour 
Chancellor Alistair Darling it peaked at 58.95p in 2011, but Mr Osborne 
then cut it to 57.95p, and has now ruled out any further rises.

Two
 thirds of the cost of petrol is made up of tax, either fuel duty or 
VAT. Tax accounts for more of the cost of petrol than in any other EU 
country.

Mr Osborne 
signalled his plan to freeze fuel duty at the Tory party conference in 
October, but at the time had not found the money to pay for it.

Three in five drivers have cut back on car use because of rising costs, according to the AA.

A
 Populus survey for the AA showed 45 per cent of people are using their 
car less and 28 per cent are slashing family or personal budgets to 
compensate.

In Wales, 67 per cent of people are spending less or driving less because of fuel costs.

Almost half of motorists have cut back on spending or driving as a result of high fuel costs, according to an AA survey

The AA argued that the economic recovery was not being felt by struggling motorists, even at a time when supermarkets are embroiled in a petrol price war.

Ahead of the Autumn Statement, AA president Edmund King said: ‘The Government has committed to a fuel duty freeze and is trying to extend the 5p rural fuel duty rebate, which is helpful.

‘However, if the Treasury is going to make concessions to the fuel retail industry, it needs to tie them to fairer pricing.

‘That can be achieved via wholesale price transparency. Despite falls in the average price, inflated prices on some forecourts mean lower sales hence fewer customers.’

Costs: Rail fares will rise by 3.1 per cent in line with inflation, instead of 4.1 per cent, saving passengers £25 a year on average

The January 2014 fare rise for regulated rail fares, which include season tickets, was to have averaged 4.1 per cent. But Mr Osborne said today that the rise would be limited to an average of 3.1 per cent.

Mr Osborne announced that his decision would benefit more than 250,000 annual season ticket holders who will, on average in 2014, save £25.

For instance, an annual season ticket from Chelmsford to London should be around £35 less in 2014 than it would have been without the change in the price formula, while an annual season ticket from Oxford to London should be around £45 less.

However, as announced earlier, train companies will still be allowed to put some regulated fares up by a limit of 2 per cent above the RPI cap (in other words by as much as 5.1 per cent) as long as the average rise is no more than 3.1 per cent.
