Tragic: A skydiver found dead after a collision with another parachutist in eastern San Diego County has been identified as the 27-year-old brother-in-law of NASCAR driver Jimmie Johnson, Jordan Janway, pictured

A skydiver found dead after a collision with another parachutist in eastern San Diego County has been identified as the 27-year-old brother-in-law of NASCAR driver Jimmie Johnson.

Jordan Janway died Sunday while skydiving with two others at Jamul, the county medical examiner's office says in a statement Monday.

Janway collided with one of the other jumpers during freefall, failed to open his parachute and fell to the ground.

A statement posted on Johnson's website says Janway was the brother of Johnson's wife, Chandra.

The statement asks for prayers and privacy.

Skydive San Diego owner Buzz Fink told reporters the victim was a veteran of more than 1,000 jumps.

The medical examiner has yet to schedule an examination of the body.

Deputies were called to search for the man around 4.30pm at John Nichol's Field, NBC San Diego reports. Janway was found at 5:15pm.

Company Skydive San Diego operates out of that field, the channel reports.

Fink said the victim was an experienced instructor with the company who had taken a group up for skydiving instruction.

Janway apparently collided with the other jumper's leg mid-air and was injured too badly to open his parachute.

The other jumper was not injured and safely landed in the drop zone, NBC San Diego reports.

Fink said Janway and other instructors usually used a device that would automatically open his parachute in an emergency -- but it was sent out for maintenance last week, UT-San Diego reports.

'We do well over 100,000 jumps a year, and we pride ourselves on our safety and everything we do as far as our equipment, our airplanes,' Fink told the channel.

'However, it is skydiving and things can happen and generally you do everything we can to prevent it.'

'I liken it to driving down the road. You have a safety belt, an air bag. The bottom line is, you're still at a risk if someone crosses that line and hits your car,' he said.

The last death at the center occurred about five years ago when a man was tangled in his chute and hit his head on a rock when he landed, UT-San Diego reports.
