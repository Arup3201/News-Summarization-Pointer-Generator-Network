Two men who claimed to be drunk and high filmed themselves driving and shouting with a wounded owl in their car.

Johnny Duverson and his cousin, who has not been named, filmed themselves waving a bottle and driving round the streets of West Palm Beach, Florida, with a Great Horned Owl in the front seat.

Duverson's cousin holds the wide-eyed bird, which is protected by federal law, in the crook of his arm while Duverson whoops and cheers.

Unexpected passenger: A video emerged showing the owl - which experts think is dazed - being held in the front seat of a car driving down a Florida highway

'Drunk and high': This bottle - seemingly of alcohol - is waved around during the footage, which was uploaded to Facebook and shared thousands of times

At one point in the video, which was uploaded to Facebook and shared thousands of times, a voice is heard shouting: 'We chillin' with a owl [sic] right now, we vibin''

Alongside the video, Duverson wrote: '3am in the morning, we are drunk, we are high, we bout to take this thing home and eat it up just found it on the road.'

Video: Johnny Duverson, pictured above, was in the car and posted the footage on his Facebook page

In a later post he said the bird was 'dancing' and 'acting crazy' during their 10-mile journey down the I-95 highway, which ended at Lake Worth.

Wildlife experts were horrified at the video, and pointed out that possessing an owl in any capacity is a breach of federal wildlife laws.

David Hitzig of the Busch Wildlife Sanctuary in Jupiter, Florida, said the owl looked as if it was dazed in the video.

Speaking to the WPTV local news station, he said: 'To me the concern is: where is the owl now, what's happened to the owl, did anybody cause harm to the owl?'

Duverson later said the owl was already hurt when they found it. When confronted by WPTV, he said: 'It didn't fly away so we knew it was hurt. Leave me alone.'

He also seemed to row back on claims of the group being drunk and high whilst driving - though he did not offer an alternative explanation.

DailyMail.com has attempted to contact Duverson.

The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation has also launched an investigation.
