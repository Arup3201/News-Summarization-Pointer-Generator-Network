A woman who lost her engagement ring 38 years ago after her daughter buried it in the garden has finally been reunited with it thanks to posting an old photo on Facebook.

Grandmother Jackie Cook, 66, never expected to see the treasured band again after her daughter Clare buried it in the garden as a three-year-old in 1976.

Mrs Cook, and her husband Benjamin, 69, unsuccessfully scoured the grounds of their home but left the ring behind when they moved a new home in the same Kent village of Halling in 1983.

She thought she would never see the ring again but amazingly she was reunited with it this week after the new occupants of her old house found the ring.

The find happened after Mrs Cook came across some photos of her old farm where she lived and posted them on Facebook.

They were then seen by Toni Crouch, 29, who recognised the farm as her own childhood home.

She immediately messaged Mrs Cook, and told her how she had found a gold ring in the back garden of the property when she was a child.

Miss Crouch, who now lives a short distance away in Sittingbourne, said she kept it because she thought it was special to someone.

She then sent a picture of the jewellery to an overjoyed Mrs Cook, who confirmed it was indeed her long-lost engagement ring.

Mrs Cook, a supermarket worker, said: 'When she told me she’d found it, I just filled up and cried and cried. I couldn’t believe she found it in that garden by sheer chance.

'I know it’s hard to believe but I had dreamed about the ring the week before and have to say I believe in fate.

'Toni said she kept it because she just had a feeling it was special to someone.

'She is such a lovely girl, she could have sold it but she kept it and I’m so grateful.

'Apart from when my grandchildren were born, this is the happiest day of my life.

'And the ring still fits. There diamond in it is missing, but we don’t care how much it costs to replace it. Finding my ring is priceless.'

Jackie, who also has a son called Benjamin, 37, recalled: 'We were on a farm so when we were collecting chickens and doing all that sort of work I would keep my wedding ring on but put my engagement ring into my jewellery box.

'I took Clare out to the garden and asked her to tell me where she put it, but the garden is absolutely massive and she was all over the place, she was only three.

'I just gave up all hope. It was of enormous emotional value to me and for years I did not replace it.

'Benjamin and I had chosen the ring together two years before we got married.'

Mrs Cook's husband a former gamekeeper, is now planning to get a new diamond for Jackie’s ring.

The couple have also given Toni a bouquet and bracelet to say thank you.

Miss Crouch said: 'It’s so wonderful to make somebody so happy.

'We shall certainly be in touch. We shall be friends for life.”

And Mrs Cook's daughter Clare, who is now 41 is also relieved her mother has been reunited with the ring.

She explained: 'Not once did my mum tell me off. I actually remember doing it and I always felt bad about it and apologised.

'I’m so glad the ring was found again, it is so lucky.'
