A suspected terrorist plot to drive a toy car loaded with explosives under the gates of a Territorial Army base and blow it up has been smashed by police.

Detectives believe the device was to have been detonated in Luton as part of a campaign of terror attacks in Britain.

Evidence of the conspiracy was obtained in a huge surveillance operation.

At one stage, undercover police looked on as terrorist suspects apparently used the mountains of Snowdonia as a training ground.

They are accused of taking their lead 
from copies of the Al-Qaeda magazine Inspire which contains blueprints 
for home-grown attacks.

The alleged complex 16-month plot 
emerged as four British Muslim men appeared in court yesterday charged 
with a raft of terrorist offences.

Zahid Iqbal, 30, is accused of leading a terror network under the instruction of shadowy Al-Qaeda masterminds in Pakistan.

He was joined in the dock by close friends Mohammed Sharfaraz Ahmed, 24, Umar Arshad, 23, and Syed Farhan Hussain, 21.

The gang are accused of working to recruit others to fight Jihad and raising vital funds.

The four suspect appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court today on terror-related charges

They were arrested at their homes in Luton last week after a multi-million pound investigation that began last year.

The men had been arrested and their 
homes searched last September but it is understood police needed more 
time to piece together the plot.

Westminster Magistrates' Court heard 
the men bought survival equipment, downloaded Al-Qaeda 
terror manuals and discussed methods and targets.

Prosecutors said two of the men were caught discussing 'building and modifying' improvised explosive devices.

They allegedly referred to 'clocks, timers, remote controls and wires' and following instructions in Inspire magazine.

One was overheard saying: 'You don't 
want to be expecting something huge and then something little going 
off.' Another said: 'I was like driving past the TA centre â€¦ if you had a
 small toy car, there's a small gap under the gate. You could drive it 
under a vehicle that they use.'

Ahmed is accused of acting as a 
recruiter and making an 'explorative visit' to Pakistan where he may 
have undertaken terrorist activities.

Hussain is alleged to have been the quartermaster who specialised in the distribution of funds and provisions.

Arshad's role was allegedly to provide
 practical guidance on activities abroad, what to wear to fit in and to 
lead the outdoor training.

All four men are accused of possessing
 editions of Inspire, a banned publication, and a terrorist book called 
44 Ways to Support Jihad.

Ahmed and Arshad were also found with
 a copy of '21 Techniques of Silent Killing', police claim. Arshad is 
also accused of owning The Al Qaeda Manual.

Hussain is accused of possessing The Book of Jihad and a manual named 'The Explosives Course Two.'

The four men were remanded in custody at top security Belmarsh Prison and will appear at the Old Bailey next week.
