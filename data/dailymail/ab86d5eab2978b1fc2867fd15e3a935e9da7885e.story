The next generation of safety technologies designed to reduce the number of road accidents, have been revealed at the Frankfurt motor show.

TRW Automotive used a life size acrylic car 'driven' by models to demonstrate how it is working towards semi-automated driving as well as other new technology innovations to keep drivers and car passengers safe.

The company believes cars will be packed with more intelligent safety systems in the next decade that can anticipate road conditions.

TRW Automotive showed off a range of airbags and active safety systems such as braking and steering products in the acrylic car, which also highlights the sensors that are used to collect information from 360 degrees around the vehicle.

The data from the sensors is used to make driver assist systems work in a bid to protect drivers, passengers and pedestrians in emergency situations.

Included in the acrylic car is an advanced radar that can be used to warn drivers of possible collisions and pedestrians, as well as spark mitigation braking and emergency braking.

A new 'active' seat belt system is fitted in the vehicle but in a real car that is forced to stop suddenly, it could help manage occupant energy during a crash.

The new seatbelts can reduce slack in driving situations and decrease the possibility of passengers being out of position and more susceptible to injury, the company said.

An integrated brake control system (IBC) enables a car to automatically brake and recover energy from braking in one package.

The company said it offers 'improved pedal feel' and performance over conventional systems with a lower overall weight.

Another feature shown off in the vehicle is an electrically powered steering system that offers fuel-saving benefits and factors in wind compensation, for example.

John Plant, chairman and CEO of TRW Automotive, said: 'Over the next decade, active safety systems will become increasingly intelligent as greater efforts are made to reduce the number of road fatalities worldwide.

'More automated functions will be introduced that will operate continuously in certain situations in addition to providing emergency support when needed.'

He believes consumers will benefit from more cars being fitted with active safety technologies as changes to road safety schemes and insurance incentives come into force across the world.

TRW currently supplies safety technologies to car manufacturers including VW, Mercedes Benz, Ford, General Motors and Toyota.

The company's stand at the automotive show also used holographic films to showcase its new technologies.
