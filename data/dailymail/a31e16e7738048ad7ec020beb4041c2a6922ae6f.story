Victim: Sarah Wright, who died aged 39 in November last year, was abused over a ten-year period by former chief superintendent, Alec Alexander

A woman who was raped as a child by her police chief father died from fear that he was about to be released from prison, it has been claimed.

Sarah Wright, who died aged 39 in November last year, was abused over a ten-year period by former chief superintendent, Alec Alexander, at their home in Hull, East Yorkshire.

He started to assault her on her seventh birthday, before raping her in 1992 when she was 17.

Alexander, who worked for Humberside Police, was jailed for ten years, aged 61, in 2008 after being found guilty of raping and indecently assaulting his daughter.

But last year, Mrs Wright was told that her father could be released from jail this summer - after serving just six years - on the grounds of 'good behaviour'.

The mother-of-three was found dead in her bathroom on November 22 by her husband, Scott Wright, after suffering from severe asthma and pneumothorax.

Today, her relatives claimed her death - which came just days before the birth of her first grandchild, India - was linked to her panic at the prospect of Alexander being freed from prison.

'She lived in mortal fear of Alec - she was absolutely terrified and petrified,' said Mr Wright, who had lived separately from his wife of 11 years.

'They [the police]
 are going to let us know when he is coming out. He has wrecked 
everything for Sarah and her family. He has wrecked it for me and my
 children and that lovely little grandchild. It is very cruel.'

Abuse: Alexander, right, who worked for Humberside Police, was jailed for ten years, aged 61, in 2008 after being found guilty of raping and indecently assaulting his daughter. But last year, Mrs Wright was told that her father could be released from jail this summer. Left, Mrs Wright aged nine - two years after the abuse started

Mrs Wright's mother-in-law Eileen Wright, 
63, said that Alexander's abuse of his daughter was 'to blame' for her death.

'I blame him for her death,' she said. 'If she hadn’t had that worry, her 
asthma would not have been so bad. She wouldn’t have had that anxiety.

'There
 were possible sightings [of Alexander] around Hessle, but that wasn’t true. I think it 
had worried her because she thought he might be getting parole this 
year.

Tragic: Mrs Wright was found dead in her bathroom on November 22 after suffering from severe asthma and pneumothorax. Today, her relatives claimed her death was linked to Alexander's potential release from prison

'She was really 
scared, she was in fear and I knew she was. He is going to be out living 
his life and she can’t.'

Mrs Wright only told her husband about the abuse she suffered at the hands of her father following their marriage at Hull Register Office on November 6, 1992.

'She hid multiple things, but opened up to me 
when we were married,' said Mr Wright. 'It was like she was trying to climb over a hill in one big step. It knocked her but she got over it.

Case: The mother-of-three waived her anonymity during a trial at Hull Crown Court (pictured) in 2008, where her father was found guilty of rape, two counts of indecent assault and one count of taking an indecent picture

'I remember her grabbing both my hands and saying "I need to say these things to you but I don’t think you’re going to like me".

'I
 said "I don’t know how to answer you apart from giving you a big 
cuddle. All I can do is stand by you and I’ll stand by you whatever".'

He added: 'She was always my little princess but I put her on top of a pedestal after that.'

Mrs Wright waived her anonymity during a trial at Hull Crown Court in 2008, where her father was found guilty of rape, two counts of indecent assault and one count of taking an indecent picture.

Alexander was also convicted of downloading almost 66,000 indecent pictures of children - many of which contained images of incest.

He was later stripped of his long-service and good conduct awards by Humberside Police.
