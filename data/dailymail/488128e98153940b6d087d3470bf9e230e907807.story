The day Essendon have been dreading has arrived - with players at the AFL club receiving official word they will be facing anti-doping charges.

It's the latest development in a saga that first came to light last February, when the club announced they would come under a joint AFL and ASADA investigation over their 2012 supplements program.

Meanwhile, NRL club the Cronulla Sharks are also in the firing line, with Fairfax Media reporting up to 17 players from their 2011 squad will also be issued show cause notices by the anti-doping body.

If proved, the anti-doping charges may well spell the end of some players' careers.

On notice: ASADA have officially announced that players at the Essendon Football Club will face charges, as a result of the anti-doping agency's joint investigation with the AFL into the club's 2012 supplements scandal

Former Essendon Bombers great Tim Watson, father of current captain Jobe, said players were in 'real shock' after ASADA issued show cause notices.

'It's been a real possibility for some time,' Mr Watson told Channel Seven.

'New AFL CEO Gillon McLachlan told the CEOs and presidents only last week they should start preparing themselves for what could be a very bumpy ride.'

'It could go on for two or three years.'

Possibly career ending: The suspensions that could be handed down may well spell the end of some Essendon players careers

Show-cause notices require those issued to explain, within 10 days, why they shouldn't be handed an infraction notice for breaching the World Anti-Doping Agency drug code.

If the explanation isn't deemed acceptable by ASADA, the anti-doping agency then compiles a report on those they believe have breached the report.

The report is then handed to a group of independent experts, who assess the evidence and decide whether an infraction notice will be handed down.

If issued with an infraction notice, the player is immediately suspended until the matter is resolved at a Tribunal.

Melbourne's The Age newspaper is reporting ASADA is issuing 34 players with show cause notices.

But ASADA, the AFL and Essendon are keeping quiet, refusing to confirm any details.

'Essendon are not in a position to comment on any matter relating to its players and the ASADA investigation,' Essendon said in a statement on Thursday night.

'The club will continue to act in the best interest of their players and respect the integrity and confidentiality of this process.'

The team were heavily penalised by the AFL last year, kicking them out of the finals and suspending coach James Hird for 12 months.

The club brought in a team of investigators to conduct an internal probe into the supplements program.

Former Telstra CEO Ziggy Switkowski was among the investigators.

He spoke of a 'disturbing picture of a pharmacologically experimental environment never adequately controlled or challenged or documented within the club.'

'It's been hanging over their head since February last year, I think they've done an amazing job to be able to go out there and play every week like they have,' AFL Players Association president Luke Ball told the AFL Footy Show on Thursday.

'I'm glad to hear that hopefully, what's happened today, gives some sort of clarity.'
