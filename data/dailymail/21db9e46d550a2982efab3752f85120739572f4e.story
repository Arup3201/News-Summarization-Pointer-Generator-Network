Patients tried to flee a London hospital screaming 'Ebola' when medics wearing biohazard suits brought in an elderly woman for emergency treatment. 

Patients at University Hospital Lewisham evacuated the casualty unit, as the woman was kept outside in an ambulance.

She was kept in the ambulance for an hour before finally being taken by  crew in protective clothing for tests, it has been reported.

University Hospital Lewisham descended into panic when medics wearing biohazard suits brought in an elderly woman for emergency treatment and a fellow patient shouted 'Ebola'

A witness told The Sun: ‘There was panic. Luckily, there was a glass wall between us and the potential victim’.

There around 40 people in the A&E department when the ambulance arrived, the witness added.

The woman was later deemed 'low risk' and sent home to await results from her tests.

A hospital spokesman said: 'Whilst we cannot discuss individual cases, we can say that we have not had any confirmed cases of Ebola at Lewisham Hospital.

'Like many other London hospitals we expect to see a number of patients with a history of travel to West Africa who need precautionary testing for Ebola under current public health guidance. In most cases, Ebola is considered very unlikely but testing is done as a precaution.'

Earlier this month it was reported that a man arrived at the hospital fearing he had the deadly virus after travelling to Britain from Sierra Leone. 

It was claimed that some staff refused to go near the man, who was reportedly allowed visitors and used a communal toilet.

The man - who was later found not to have the virus - was not transferred to the specialist Royal Free Hospital, which is the only hospital in Britain equipped with a fully 'ebola-proof' isolation unit.

According to the latest statistics from the World Health Organization (WHO), the virus has killed more than 4,500 people since first appearing deep in the Guinean forest last December. 

Yesterday, a further 135 British Army medics left Britain for Ebola-stricken Sierra Leone. 

The doctors, nurses and consultants from the Royal Army Medical Corps will train West African health care workers who will man  five Ebola Treatment Units the UK is currently building - but will not treat the public.

International Development Secretary Justine Greening also boarded the flight from RAF Brize Norton to Sierra Leone to help with the fight against Ebola.

The Cabinet minister says Britain is leading the international response to the disease in the country, and has pledged a £125 million aid package including support for 700 treatment beds.

It comes as Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond warned European leaders to urgently  stump up extra money to fight the Ebola crisis - as figures revealed the founders of Facebook and Microsoft alone had given almost as much as France.

Mr Hammond, in Luxembourg for a crisis summit on the epidemic sweeping West Africa, said world leaders had ‘a short window’ to beat the disease.

European Union governments are working to raise £800 million in aid by the end of the week to fight the deadly virus - with Britain and the US having so far picked up the bulk of the costs of fighting the outbreak.
