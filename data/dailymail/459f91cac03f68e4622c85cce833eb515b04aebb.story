Devin Toner is still getting used to the profile that comes with being Paul O’Connell’s partner in the Ireland second row.

Walking through Temple Bar in Dublin, a youngster asks the 6ft 11in forward: ‘Are you famous?’ His bashful response is: ‘No, not at all.’

Once the fan is out of sight, he adds: ‘I think most people only stop me because I’m tall, rather than the fact I play rugby.’

He is every inch the reluctant celebrity, but as the tallest player in the RBS 6 Nations it is difficult to blend into the background.

The 28-year-old has been a late bloomer on the international stage and - having been fondly known as the Big Friendly Giant during his school days - reveals he had to develop an abrasive edginess to ensure that his oversized frame can fulfil its destructive potential.

‘People used to say I wasn’t mean enough and I would just roll with the punches,’ said Toner. ‘I was always the BFG as a teenager. I wasn’t someone to throw my weight around. It’s not like I’ve suddenly developed a mean streak, but I’ve had to work on that ability to physically dominate my opponent. I’ve had my fair share of critics and I’ve had to develop that edge. You leave the nice guy approach behind when you get on the pitch.’

Speaking at his home in the Portobello suburb of Dublin, Toner explains how the collection of cards on his shelves are not in recognition of his rugby successes, but in congratulation for his engagement to girlfriend Mary Scott.

The couple are in the process of renovating their terraced house and one of the first jobs is to remove a beam in the kitchen that is precariously low for a man of Toner’s height. The former Castlerock College student used to have teenage angst about his size, but it now pays the bills for the Leinster forward.

Toner's main passion as a kid was Gaelic football before taking rugby seriously late on in his teenage years

‘Jonny Sexton (Ireland fly-half) calls me Mongo after the gingerbread man in Shrek,’ said Toner. ‘I was 6ft by the time I was 11 and there have always been nicknames - it was High Tower at college. But no-one ever bullied me and I didn’t bully anyone either, it was just one of those things. When you’re around 13 or 14 there was that typical teenage awkwardness because you would stand out and be a bit self-conscious, but you get used to it. I was fat as well - one of my other nicknames was chunky!’

Toner’s father works in shipping and his mother was previously employed by Guinness. His brother, Dara, is 6ft 6in, and his sister, Emma, is 5ft 10in.

Growing up in the County Meath countryside, he previously played Gaelic football and only started to take rugby seriously during his later teenage years.

His development has been closely monitored by Ireland coach Joe Schmidt, with the pair working together at Leinster between 2010 and 2013, before the Kiwi took up the position as national coach. Schmidt has been hailed as the brains behind Ireland’s resurgence and, according to Toner, there is no one better in the business.

‘He’s one of the best coaches in the world,’ said Toner. ‘His attention to detail is phenomenal and every little thing has to be spot on. After we lost to New Zealand (in 2013), he went back through the whole thing and picked apart every detail. There was a missed tackle here, or an unnecessary man in the ruck there that compromised the defensive line. He stopped it at every point - he has the video analysts working some pretty long hours.’

Schmidt's arrival has seen Toner become a regular starter in the Ireland setup over the last 12 months

Schmidt’s appointment as Ireland coach ties in with Toner’s resurgence in the Test arena. Despite making his international debut back in 2010, Toner has doubled his number of starts in the green jersey over the last 12 months.

He has become a key component in the line-out and has been making more of an impact at the collision area, working on his ability to get low. Toner fits into Schmidt’s vision and reveals how the New Zealander has changed the ethos at the Dublin-based camps.

‘He’s very consumed with rugby and winning,’ said Toner. ‘I’ve never really been for a beer with him but he puts a huge amount of hours into his job and he’s very, very focused in that way. There’s been a bit of a shift in mentality since he took over.

‘Before you might hear stories about some of the lads being worse for wear on a Monday morning, but if you’re not 100 per cent now then you’re pretty much out of the team.’

Toner is confident Ireland will earn a positive result against England then they meet in Dublin on March 1

Like a fine wine, Toner has reached an age where there are far less doubts about his place in the starting XV. He is expected to line up against England next Sunday and the winning team will finish the weekend on top of the Six Nations standings.

But has there been any mention of the Grand Slam? ‘It isn’t really talked about,’ added Toner. ‘But your goal is obviously to win every game. England are an exciting young team and they have some lads making a name for themselves.

‘There will be a few extra cameras at training and there will be a bit more hype, but we’ll just be focused on the challenge in hand.

‘We’ll have it up against us, but I think we’ll hold our own.’
