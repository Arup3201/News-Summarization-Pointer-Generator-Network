A teenage girl who suffered a potentially fatal allergic reaction to medication was sent home from the hospital three days in a row before she was properly diagnosed.

On her 19th birthday Danika Heron noticed a small rash on her chest which quickly started spreading across her entire body.

Over four days her symptoms got progressively more severe and she was eventually diagnosed with a life-threatening skin condition, admitted to hospital and wrapped in bandages from head-to-toe.

On Thursday May 29 Miss Heron, who recently moved to Sydney from Nowra on the NSW south coast to start a chef apprenticeship, went to a hospital in the northwest to show them her rash  but was told she most likely had gastro and was sent home.

The next day the rash was still spreading and started blistering. Her eyes also became swollen and red so she went back to the same hospital but was sent home again.

'They kept on giving me different diagnoses, first they said I had herpes and gastro, second they said it was foot and mouth disease, measles and chicken pox,' Miss Heron told Daily Mail Australia.

Miss Heron, who was diagnosed with epilepsy shortly after her 18th birthday, recently started taking new medication.

'I was telling them I'd just started new medication but they weren't listening,' she said.

By Saturday her lips were ulcerated and she couldn't open them because they kept sticking together.

'I got annoyed and very upset so I ended up getting mum and dad to come pick me up,' Miss Heron said.

Her mother Carmen Heron, who lives in North Nowra, said she was terrified so she raced up to Sydney to check on her daughter.

'She was a mess, she had swollen eyes, fluid coming out of her eyes, swollen lips with blisters and blisters all over her body,' she said.

'I knew she was having an allergic reaction so I told her get off her medication.'

Mrs Heron took Miss Heron to a hospital in Nowra where she was diagnosed with the potentially fatal Stevens-Johnson syndrome, but was again sent home.

She does not wish to name the hospital as she is pursuing a formal complaint.

'It's not normal, there's a very real threat you can die from it. It's a life threatening syndrome, she shouldn't have been sent home,' Mrs Heron said.

'I was angry that it was taking so long and that she was diagnosed with something and sent home too.'

On Sunday Miss Heron went back to hospital because she couldn't breathe or swallow anything.

An ICU doctor who was in the emergency ward saw her and realised straight away how serious her condition was, and organised for her to be transported by ambulance to Concord Hospital in Sydney more than two hours away.

Her symptoms got progressively worse, and by Saturday her lips were ulcerated and she couldn't open them because they kept sticking together

'By the time I got transferred up to the other hospital the doctors up there did biopsies and found I had toxic epidermal necrolysis [TEN],' Miss Heron said.

Dr Saxon Smith, dermatologist and president of the NSW chapter of the Australian Medical Association, said 30 per cent of patients who contract TEN die.

Dr Smith told Daily Mail Australia it is a more severe version of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, and that it affects about one in 500,000 people each year.

He added that about 90 per cent of cases are caused by reactions to medication, but it can also be caused by viral and other infections.

Miss Heron was bandaged from head-to-toe in silver dressing and was in hospital for three weeks.

'I was treated like a burns patient,' she said.

It is now six weeks after she first went to hospital and she is living with her parents and recovering slowly.

She needs to get her eyes tested every two weeks because there is a chance she may go blind.

Miss Heron is also still losing fingernails, suffering joint pains and has scarring that needs to heal.

'It scares me still because I didn't realise how bad it was until I looked at photos,' she said.

'I'm just glad I'm home, down here to have a month off work, then I'll be going back up to Sydney to start work again.'
