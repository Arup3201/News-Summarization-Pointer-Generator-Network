Border guards in Mexico were given a bit of a shock when they opened a package to find ten baby crocodiles scampering around - even though the box was clearly marked 'Crocs'.

The officials in the city of Jalpa de Mendez in Tabasco were suspicious that the box might contain counterfeit footwear, as the label said the contents were Crocs golfing shoes.

But it turned out there were in fact genuine crocs inside, just not the type they were expecting. 

Border guards did not expect to find the reptilian creatures - despite opening a box marked Crocs

Border guard official Rode Tamez, 45, said: 'The baby crocodiles were badly dehydrated. We called in the environmental protection agency which took control of them.'

A spokesman for the agency said: 'The crocodiles were being posted from here to a city over 500 miles away, clearly to be sold on the black market.

'It is doubtful that they would have survived.

'Unfortunately, this method of animal trafficking is becoming more commonplace.

'Because of the cramped conditions they are kept in, the stress they go through and the lack of food given to them, there is a very high mortality rate among animals smuggled this way.'

The baby crocodiles were being trafficked by animal smugglers and were severely dehydrated when found

He added that crocodiles are considered an endangered species in Mexico and that if caught the traffickers could face up to nine years jail.

The spokesman said: 'It's an ongoing battle between us and the smugglers, but this time we won and were able to save the lives of the crocodiles.'

The baby crocs were taken to a local zoo where they are now being cared for.

The box containing the baby crocodiles was marked as containing Crocs shoes, a distinctive brand of footwear
