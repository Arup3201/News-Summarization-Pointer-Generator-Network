Arsene Wenger praised Joel Campbell's skill and attitude after the Costa Rica international grabbed his first goal for Arsenal.

The 22-year-old scored a well-timed volley to help Arsenal beat Benfica 5-1 in the Emirates Cup, and Wenger was full of praise for the young forward.

Speaking to the club's website, he said: 'Campbell has done very well. I like the way he plays, he's good on the ball, creative and collectively as well he has a good balance between individual skill and collective attitude - that's not easy to find.'

As well as scoring his first goal for the club, Campbell also combined well with Yaya Sanogo and the Arsenal manager insisted they would both have roles to play in the coming season.

He said: 'They need to play of course but they need to play here.'

When pushed on whether he would even consider letting Campbell go, the 64-year-old was adamant that would not happen.

'There's no reason to let him go,' he said, 'I want to keep him.'

Joel Campbell was clearly pleased with his own performance, and posted a picture of his shirt online, with the words 'Perfect day'.
