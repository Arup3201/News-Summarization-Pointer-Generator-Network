David Cameron has admitted he does not know how much a supermarket loaf costs – because he bakes his own using a bread-making machine.

The Prime Minister was asked the price of a ‘value’ range loaf after claiming he is not out of touch with ordinary people over the rising cost of living.

He guessed it was more than £1 – in fact it is 47p – then by way of explanation got himself into a deeper hole by saying he does not eat ‘the value stuff’.

Hardworking: David Cameron used a series of TV interviews to reject claims he is out of touch, before plugging artisan flour and breadmakers

Instead he uses a £100 breadmaker and a brand of Cotswolds artisan flour which costs around £4.40 a bag. In comparison a 1.5kg bag of Tesco’s own brand flour costs only 65p.

Mr Cameron has often highlighted his credentials as a domesticated husband and father, being filmed doing the washing up and boasting of making pancakes on a Sunday morning in his constituency home in Oxfordshire.

Yesterday on LBC radio he was asked to name the price of a ‘value sliced white bread loaf at Tesco or Sainsbury’s’. Mr Cameron replied: ‘It’s going to cost you north of £1.’

To the real baker, the idea of using a breadmaker is worse than cheating, it is an insult to the craft of creating a loaf from scratch.

Great British Bake-Off's Paul Hollywood teases those who rely on a machine, saying: 'Not really baking, is it?'

But David Cameron insists his Panasonic applicance does the job, turning his expensive local flour into delicious granary loaves for his children.

The most popular model which the Camerons are believed to have starts at £100, able to create nine different bread types including wholemeal, Rye bread and pizza dough.

Reminded that he was being asked about a value sliced loaf, he said: ‘I don’t buy the value stuff... I’ve got a breadmaker which I delight in using and it turns out in all sorts of different ways.’

He rejected suggestions that making bread at home takes too long, saying: ‘You think ahead. A little plug for the flour made in my constituency: The Cotswold Crunch.

'You get some of that – beautifully milled in the Cotswolds – you pop that in your breadmaker.

‘You can set the timer overnight so when you wake up there’s this wonderful smell wafting through your kitchen. It takes 30 seconds to put your ingredients in.’

It is understood the Camerons have the cheapest Panasonic model of breadmaker, which starts at £100.

Labour vice-chairman Michael Dugher said: ‘When he said, “I have a breadmaker” most people will have assumed he had his own personal baker.’

Rebellious Tory MP Nadine Dorries once described Mr Cameron and George Osborne as ‘posh boys who don’t know the price of milk’.

On Monday Boris Johnson admitted he did not know the price of a pint of milk.

Yesterday, asked about value bread, he joked: ‘I can tell you the price of a bottle of champagne, how about that?’

London Mayor Boris Johnson admitted he did not know the price of a pint of milk

Boris Johnson was forced to admit on TV that he did not know how much a pint of milk cost - but he did not seem to care.

The London Mayor told BBC's Newsnight how the cost of living was going to be a big political issue at the next election.

He was asked by presenter Jeremy Paxman: 'Do you even know the cost of  pint of milk?'

But Mr Johnson replied: 'About 80p or something like that...'

Told it was actually half that at 40p, he conceded: 'Well there you go, I don't know how much a pint of milk costs. So what?'

You could almost hear his aides choking on their croissants as they feared a PR disaster. By boasting that he ‘delights’ in using his own bread-making machine, David Cameron made a lifestyle statement that risked alienating the millions who haven’t the time or inclination to make their own loaves.

There’s no doubting the appeal of the smell of a baked loaf in the morning or of the fact it lacks the additives found in the supermarket loaves the Prime Minister says he eschews.

The trouble is, though, that the economics don’t quite stack up. I know this, because I own a Panasonic SD-255 – perhaps the very model Mr Cameron owns.

Dough: The Prime Minister recommended a 
Panasonic breadmaker and the Cotswold Crunch flour made near his 
Oxfordshire constituency

It clutters up our kitchen with myriad 
other gadgets. Although my wife loves it, I wish I could just throw the 
damn thing away. Moneywise, they are a rip-off.

A Panasonic 
breadmaker will cost up to £150 – about 320 ‘value’ loaves of bread. And
 that’s before you include the price of the ingredients.

Mr Cameron says he buys a brand of flour called Cotswold Crunch, that sells for a whopping £4.38 per 1.5kg bag.

David Cameron does not use any ordinary flour from a budget supermarket.

The
 Cotswold Crunch variety he hailed on the radio is produced by millers 
FWP Matthews, which traces its roots back to Oxfordshire in the 1860s.

The
 dark variety is described as 'the connoisseur's blend of strong white 
flour, malt flour, malted wheat flakes and rye flour for bread and 
rolls'.

It costs £21.40 for five 1.5kg bags, working out at £4.38 per bag.

By contrast, a bag of strong white bread flour in Tesco costs just 80p.

To
 make a basic sandwich loaf in a Panasonic breadmaker, you need 400g of 
flour. That’s £1.17 worth of lovely Cotswold Crunch. Then you’ll need 
15g of butter (about 7p), about 5p worth of yeast and about 2p of sugar 
and salt. (The 280 ml of water is a negligible cost – 0.03p.) This 
brings the grand total to just over £1.30.

At first, that doesn’t seem too much. But wait, we’ve forgotten something – the cost of the electricity!

Breadmakers
 use, on average 550 watts, and it takes five hours to make a sandwich 
loaf. That means, at a rate of 14.5p per  kilowatt hour, that will cost 
40p  a loaf.

So, adding the original price of the machine (and 
assuming it lasts long enough to make 1,000 loaves), the total cost per 
Cameron loaf will be £1.85, or the equivalent of nearly four ‘value’ 
loaves.

Of course Mr Cameron could use normal flour at 80p per 1.5kg,
 which would reduce the cost of a loaf to 95p. But that is still the 
cost of two ‘value’ loaves.

And then there’s the fact that 
breadmakers are hardly the easiest of gadgets to look after. (Mr Cameron
 himself admits that while busy running the country, dealing with Syria 
and liaising with foreign leaders, using his Panasonic breadmaker means 
having to regularly set it up several hours in advance.)

Then, if my 
experience is anything to go by, the kneading blade often gets left 
inside the loaf,  and the bits of burned bread  are difficult to clean 
off the baking tin.

Also, because the bread doesn’t have factory-added preservatives, it tends to go stale quickly.

Another problem is that my Panasonic loaves are smaller than the average 800g loaf bought in a shop.

Unlike
 the Prime Minister, I think breadmakers are a con, and by recommending 
their use, he reveals that he is more out of touch than simply not 
knowing the price of bread.

The next time he is interviewed about such things, he’d be better advised to use his loaf.
