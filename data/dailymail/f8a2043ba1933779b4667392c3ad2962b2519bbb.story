A rare 1,000lb thresher shark has been sighted leaping in mid-air as it swam alongside hundreds of dolphins off the Welsh coast.

The 16ft shark leapt out of the water half a mile off the Pembrokeshire coast.

The acrobatics were caught on camera by photographer Richard Crossen who was sailing with marine biologist Cliff Benson.

The rare sighting occurred when the breaching shark swam with a pod of dolphins

Mr Benson said: 'This was an extremely rare sighting.

'Unlike dolphins, which breathe air, sharks rarely come to the surface of the water.

'If you offered to pay someone £1,000 to get a photograph like this, they would not be able to.'

Sightings of the shark are so uncommon that only six were seen in UK waters last year.

In 2011, the number was just two. Many of the sightings occurred after the sharks were caught in fishing nets.

The group of researchers from The Sea Trust were observing a pod of common dolphins, as part of an ongoing 10-year survey.

The pod was spotted near the site of a proposed Atlantic Array offshore wind farm.

Threshers and other species of shark have been found off the Welsh coast because the sea is warmer due to this year’s hot summer.

The leaping shark was seen on Monday afternoon, among a pod of several hundred dolphins - many of which had small calves.

Thresher sharks could eat dolphins but marine biologists said they were hunting the same prey as the pod

Mr Benson, director of the Sea Trust, said: 'Sharks could potentially eat small dolphins, but in this case, the animal seems to have been feeding on the same prey as the dolphins - herring and mackerel.'

Thresher sharks use their long flexible tails to whip and stun fish before eating them.

Mr Benson added: 'It has a specialist hunting technique - it thrashes around and whacks its prey with its tail.

'They are lone oceanic wanderers. This animal could have been in the Azores three or four weeks ago.'
