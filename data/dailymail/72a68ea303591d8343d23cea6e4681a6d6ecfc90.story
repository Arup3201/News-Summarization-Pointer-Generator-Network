Team news

Everton

Full-back Leighton Baines (groin) faces a late fitness test ahead of Sunday's Barclays Premier League clash with Newcastle at Goodison Park.

Centre-back John Stones is expected to be available again after missing Thursday's Europa League win over Dynamo Kiev due to a virus, and winger Aaron Lennon definitely is after being cup-tied for that match.

Midfielder Gareth Barry misses out as he starts a two-match suspension, while Bryan Oviedo (hamstring), Tony Hibbert, Steven Pienaar and Aiden McGeady (all knee) remain sidelined.

Provisional squad: Howard, Robles, Stones, Alcaraz, Jagielka, Coleman, Baines, Garbutt, Besic, McCarthy, Barkley, Gibson, Osman, Mirallas, Atsu, Lennon, Naismith, Lukaku, Kone.

Newcastle

Striker Papiss Cisse will miss Sunday's Barclays Premier League trip to Everton as he begins a seven-match ban.

The Senegal international incurred the suspension after accepting an FA improper conduct charge, and he will swap places with midfielder Jack Colback, who is available once again after sitting out the last two games following his 10th booking of the campaign.

He will be joined in the squad by keeper Rob Elliot following his recovery from a long-term thigh injury and midfielder Remy Cabella, who has shaken off a knee problem, but full-back Massadio Haidara is out after having an injection in his damaged knee and joins a lengthy list of absentees.

Provisional squad: Krul, Elliot, Woodman, Janmaat, Williamson, Coloccini, R.Taylor, Anita, Abeid, Colback, Sissoko, Gouffran, Ameobi, Obertan, Gutierrez, Riviere, Perez, Armstrong, Satka.

There has been a goal scored inside the first five minutes in three of the last four Premier League games between the Magpies and the Toffees.
