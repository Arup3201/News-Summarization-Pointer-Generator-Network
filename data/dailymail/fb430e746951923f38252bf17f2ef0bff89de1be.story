A teenage boy bullied for having big ears at school is now turning heads as a female glamour model.

Tiffany-Rose, who has been living as a woman since the age of 17, was born Niall Davies. As a teenage boy, she was subjected to cruel taunts by classmates who branded her 'ugly'.

She made the life-changing decision to become female and her naturally feminine looks have now seen her land modelling work.

Tiffany-Rose is set for a full sex change on the NHS and wants to pay for a breast augmentation herself to take her to a 34C.

The 22-year-old, from Birmingham, says she has come a long way from the schoolboy bullied for having big ears and a big nose.

Tiffany-Rose, who is currently on hormone treatment, said: 'Kids at school would tease me because my ears stuck out and I had a big nose.

'I would be called a "freak" and "ugly" and names like "dumbo". It was really upsetting. I didn't have many friends and felt isolated.

'Now I pass well as a woman - most people would have no idea I was born a man. I want to have a full sex change and boob job to make my transformation complete.

'I'd love to become a transgender underwear model to show those in my position that anything is possible,' she says.

Tiffany-Rose has based her style on her heroes, who include Kim Kardashain, Cheryl Cole and Britney Spears.

She said: 'I'm all about being individual but I get confidence from my favourite celebrities.

'I'm similar to Cheryl as we both just want to settle down and get married.

'I dyed my hair brown like Kim and Cheryl as I think it suits me compared to being bleach blonde, even though I did love being a blonde as it made me look like my idol Britney.'

Unemployed Tiffany-Rose recalls how she first started to feel unhappy in her body aged eight.

She: 'I loved watching my mum doing her hair and make-up. I didn't like anything boyish and I hated wearing boy's clothes.

'It was all very confusing, I was very young.'

She claims she knew from the age of 13 that she wanted to become a girl and began experimenting with make-up.

She said: 'I would go to school really early to avoid anyone in my family noticing I was wearing it.

'People would call me "gay boy", but I'd made a few girl mates by them so they stuck up for me.'

A year later Tiffany-Rose decided to tell her mum about her feelings, which at first made her think she was homosexual.

She said: 'My mum didn't seem surprised when I told her I was gay, but when she explained that being gay simply meant I would be attracted to other men I knew that wasn't the case.

'I felt like a woman and was attracted to straight men. She told me that she'd thought for years that I might be transgender - which meant that I wanted to be a woman.

'That's when I first started to understand my feelings.'

At 16, Tiffany-Rose enrolled at a college to study hairdressing and began to accept her new identity.

One year later she started calling herself Tiffany-Rose.

She said: 'My mum was amazing, she knew I was probably transgender but wanted me come to my own conclusions.

'I haven't had contact with my biological father for five years but he knows I'm transgender and doesn't have a problem with it.'

Tiffany-Rose changed her name by deed poll in 2010 and began a course of hormones a year ago.

She said: 'The hormones have given me confidence, my boobs are growing and myskin is a lot softer.

'It will take two years to feminise me but I will be on them for the rest of my life.

'Having boobs will allow me to fulfil my ambitions of being a transsexual glamour model.

'I want to inspire other transsexuals, showing them that being born in the wrong gender doesn't stop you from having a successful career.'

Tiffany-Rose added: 'I hope to bring out my own make-up range and open a hairdressing salon, I'm really excited about the future.'
