One is the most iconic supermodel of all time, while the other is quickly rising up the ranks.

And now Cara Delevingne, widely cited as the new Kate Moss, has opened up about her friend.

To celebrate the launch of the Kate 
Moss x Topshop collection, the high street mecca has collaborated with 
NOWNESS to create eight short films, offering fashion fans an 
unprecedented glimpse into the supermodel's world - and this week's star is Cara.

Look who it is! Cara Delevingne is the latest star of a short fashion film to promote Kate Moss' soon-to-launch Topshop collection

Through
 a series of interviews with Kate’s friends and fashion network, all of 
whom she believes have influenced her career and make her who she is, an
 intimate portrait is created of Kate and her world.

Cara, 21, can be seen laying on a bed as she reveals: 'I was never into fashion that much when I was a kid, ever! I was such a tomboy but Kate Moss, I just knew exactly who she was, of course.

'She was the face, she was the icon.'

Cara, who is known in the industry for her tomboy style, said of her shopping habits through the ages: 'I just used to wear superhero clothes. I think it was when I got to thirteen, we just used to save all our pocket money and go to Topshop.

Oh, Cara! In typical crazy Cara style, the supermodel, who is currently in Shanghai with Suki Waterhouse, can be seen doing flips on the bed

'Then we'd go back to school and everyone would be wearing the same thing.'

Speaking about Kate's collaboration with the store, Cara, who has modelled for Topshop herself, said: 'As soon as I heard that she was working with Topshop, I knew it was perfect.

'London brand and London girl - THE London girl - coming together. I knew she'd bring something to make it "her".

'Everyone wanted to dress like Kate and she bought that to the collection and has let everyone have that style that she has, which is just incredible.'

Cara, who is currently in Shanghai with Suki Waterhouse, brings her quirky edge to the film, which sees her doing somersaults on her bed.

Each of the fashion films aim to reflect a different side of Kate, with her A-list friends sharing their favourite Moss moments.

ever given him, Charlotte Tilbury muses over Kate’s iconic style,

Shot by acclaimed London-based American artist Leigh Johnson, two films are being aired weekly on Topshop.com in the four weeks running up to the Kate Moss Topshop launch on April 30.

The model's SS14 
collection is full of Seventies-style pieces, including fringed suede 
jackets, jump suits and maxi dresses.

There are also embroidered smock-tops, silk blouses and graphic print kaftans on offer, going on sale in high street stores globally and online.

Vintage vibe: The collection includes maxi dresses for evening and day wear with many items inspired by Kate's own wardrobe

Kate is said to have taken 
inspiration from her own wardrobe, which, despite her status as a 
supermodel, isn't just full of designer labels. She's also a fan of 
scouring the rails of second-hand stores.

A weave waistcoat, suede shorts and a
 deep blue fringed jacket are all in keeping with the Seventies vibe. 
The latter is said to be inspired by a jacket the 40-year-old has worn 
to three Rolling Stones concerts which she refers to as her 'gig 
jacket'.

As well as 
channelling a vintage look, she was also keen to reflect her laidback 
style. There are baggy pyjama trousers glammed up through the use of printed satin 
material and cool kaftans perfect for hitting the 
beach in over the summer.

Print kaftans and blouses are a wardrobe staple for jetsetter Kate, while a girl can't have enough LBDs

For evening wear, there are sexy frilled flapper-style dresses and long numbers that flash a hint of thigh.

Meanwhile there are also some tailored pieces, including tuxes and trouser suits and summery floral printed shirts.

While much of the collection will be sold at affordable prices, one dress is a more pricey £600.

The high price tag is to reflect the handiwork that went into creating the densely hand-beaded dress.

Kate first collaborated with Topshop in 2007 before taking a break to work on other projects.

The Kate Moss collection will be sold globally in all Topshop stores and 
online at Topshop.com, NET-A-PORTER.COM, Nordstrom stores and 
Nordstrom.com from 30 April.
