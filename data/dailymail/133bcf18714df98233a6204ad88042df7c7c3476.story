These heartbreaking pictures show the moments after a hyena gave birth to two cubs after getting caught in a snare.

The new-born cubs were discovered by conservationists in the Savé Valley Conservancy, Zimbabwe, after they were informed by anti-poaching scouts of a hyena in a trap.

It is believed the heavily pregnant hyena had a 'trauma birth', brought on by the stress of being caught in the trap.

Yet despite the mother's despair, Dr Rosemary Groom, project director at the African Wildlife Conservation Fund, said the hyena had managed to create a shallow den for her cubs underneath where she was trapped.

Dr Groom, who was helped in the rescue mission by ranch manager, Duke Cloete, and an anti-poaching scout, said: 'After being informed by anti-poaching scouts, we found the adult caught half way up a shallow-sloped bank near a small water pool.

'We darted her in the rump and moved off quickly to allow the drugs to take effect with minimal stress to the animal.

'As we watched her fall asleep we noticed there was a "complication".

'There was one tiny cub on the slope near the adult and when we got closer there was another tiny cub in the shallow scraping under where she was sitting.

'We put both tiny cubs on to suckle whilst we dealt with the mother.'

The team blindfolded the hyena to ensure that removing the snare was less stressful for the animal.

They then lifted the wire from around her chest and, once the snare was removed, cleaned the wounds to prevent infection.

Dr Groom said: 'Fortunately the snare around the mother was not too bad - it was around the chest on one side, rather than the neck and hadn't cut in too deeply.

'Whilst we cleaned her wounds with penicillin, we noticed an old wound around her neck from a snare - clearly she had been caught before and managed to get out.'

When the team went back the next day the mother and cubs had moved on

Dr Rosemary Groom, project director at the African Wildlife Conservation Fund said: 'I am confident she would have moved her cubs off to the safety of a den later that evening'
