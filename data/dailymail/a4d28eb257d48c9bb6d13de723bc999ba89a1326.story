Commuters on the London Underground have been urged to walk instead of taking the train in the latest bid to cut congestion during the rush hour.

Passengers frequently complain that rush hour services on some lines are so packed that it can be hard to find a place to stand comfortably, let alone get a seat.

But instead of compensating commuters for the poor conditions or increasing the frequency of trains, Transport for London bosses have launched a new campaign to persuade passengers to avoid the Tube altogether.

Crush: Tube passengers have been urged to avoid public transport during peak rush hour times

Londoners arriving at Northern Line stations in Clapham, Balham and Tooting this morning were handed leaflets advising them to consider walking to their destination, according to the Evening Standard.

The pamphlets, as well as information boards at the stations, warned commuters to avoid travelling altogether between 8am and 8.45 as part of a pilot scheme to reduce congestion.

In addition, it was suggested that passengers should walk or cycle between the busiest stations.

The journey between Tooting Bec and Clapham North, the stations at either end of the area targeted today, takes seven minutes by train, but by foot would be around 50 minutes.

Moreover, thousands of people commute from South London into the City or the West End, which would take hours to walk to.

Busy: Transport for London is hoping to reduce the density of passengers at peak times

Some passengers expressed outraged that they were being told not to take the Tube even though many have bought travelcards which cost at least Â£1,000 a year.

Others pointed out that - like this morning, when it was raining at the stations involved in the scheme - the weather is often too bad to walk.

Advertising worker Laura Belcher, 26, told the Standard: 'I can't see why TfL can't put on more trains. It's terrible.'

Caroline Pidgeon, the Liberal Democrats' London transport spokesman, added: 'If TfL want more people to walk they need to provide an incentive for people to do so, such as travelcard discounts.'

Stuart Reid, programme director of TfL, insisted that the organisation is not trying to force its customers off trains.

'We are certainly not calling for everyone to walk,' he said. 'We are providing information to customers on when the busiest times are at their stations so that they can make an informed choice on whether to make a small change to their journey, if they are able to.

'We appreciate that not everyone can change their travel time, but for those who may be able to by making a small change to the time they travel could make their journeys more comfortable.'

The scheme is based on last year's Olympics, when bosses managed to ease congestion on the Tube by persuading them to avoid rush hour travel.
