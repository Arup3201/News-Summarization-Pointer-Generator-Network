Prime Minister Tony Abbott is being haunted by his own, damning words, in a video that has resurfaced today.

The embattled Liberal leader this afternoon tried to shrug off the fact nearly 40 per cent of his own colleagues voted for a leadership spill, insisting 'this matter is now behind us'.

But he wasn't nearly so forgiving when 31 of former prime minister Julia Gillard's colleagues voted against her leadership in February 2012. 

The video from parliamentary Question Time shows Mr Abbott questioning how Ms Gillard could continue as leader, considering her lack of party support.

In the video, Opposition Leader Tony Abbott asked how Ms Gillard could claim a mandate as Prime Minister

Ms Gillard responded by reminding Mr Abbott he won the leadership off Malcolm Turnbull by a single vote

'My question is to the Prime Minister,' Mr Abbott said, rising to address the House of Representatives. 

'Given that one third of her parliamentary colleagues, and a quarter of her cabinet colleagues have expressed their lack of confidence in her, how can she claim to have a mandate to continue as Prime Minister?' 

Ms Gillard had just defeated Mr Rudd in the second of four leadership spills during that era between the pair by a margin of 71 to 31. 

The then prime minister rebuked him - 'he comes into this Parliament having survived his leadership issues by one vote!' - but he wasn't done. 

Contrition: Mr Abbott said 'good government starts today' - some sixteen months into his prime ministership

Pained: More than half of his backbench colleagues voted to spill the leadership

Changed times: Mr Abbott (left, with wife Margie) today defeated a leadership spill motion by 61 votes to 39

Mr Abbott (flanked by parliamentary colleagues) survived the motion but was politically wounded by the internal dissent of the past few weeks

Mr Abbott arrived at today's party meeting with Foreign Minister Julie Bishop - touted as a potential leadership contender herself - by his side

'Mr Speaker, I have a supplementary question for the Prime Minister. 

'How can the Prime Minister claim to be leading a united team when the former Prime Minister and former foreign minister said that the Prime Minister had 'lost the trust of the Australian people' and 31 of her caucus colleagues backed the former prime minister?'

Years on, it is Mr Abbott himself who is damaged by a lack of support from his own colleagues, with 39 Liberals voting for his leadership to be re-considered. 

And history does repeat itself. Opposition Leader Bill Shorten today asked Mr Abbott: 'Now that one third of his parliamentary colleagues have today expressed their lack of confidence in him, how can (Mr Abbott) claim to have a mandate?'

As Mr Abbott knows, that's a dangerous line of questioning.
