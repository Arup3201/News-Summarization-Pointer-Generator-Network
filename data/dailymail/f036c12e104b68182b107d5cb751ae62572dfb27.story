It is India's most iconic attraction, so the Taj Mahal always needs to looks its best - which is why it is set to undergo a mudpack treatment.

The white marble mausoleum will receive the unusual treatment to help eliminate discolouration caused by pollution.

The cleaning treatment is similar to a traditional mud pack used by Indian women on their faces to attain a natural glow.

Marble masterpiece: The Taj Mahal is set to undergo a mud pack treatment to counter discolouration caused by pollution

Based in the city of Agra and not far from an oil refinery, the white marble of the UNESCO World Heritage Site yellows over time due to pollution.

The lime-rich clay will be applied all over the building, left to dry then cleaned off using distilled water.

It is the fourth time the Taj Mahal has undergone the treatment, which has previously been carried out in 1994, 2001 and 2008. The high levels of pollution in the area are why it has been carried out more frequently in recent years.

The Taj Mahal is famed as the finest example of Mughal art in India and attracts millions of visitors every year.

Reassurance: The treatment will take place over six months so tourism won't be affected

It was built by Emperor Shah Jahan for his third wife Mumtaz Mahal, who was his favourite and died in childbirth, and was completed in 1653.

During the beauty treatment the monument will remain open to tourists.

B M Bhatnagar from the Archeological Survey of India told the Press Trust of India: 'In the last treatment, which cost around Rs.10.4 lakh ($24,000), a team of two dozen experts had carried out the work in small sections over a period of six months to ensure that the tourist inflow does not suffer.'

The special mud pack is already being made and a 2mm-thick layer will be added to sections of the building soon.
