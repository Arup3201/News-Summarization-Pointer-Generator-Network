At first glance Tim’s Place in Albuquerque, New Mexico may look like countless other local diners, but it is in fact rather different and very special.

Billed as ‘the world’s friendliest restaurant,’ it is also the only one in the country whose owner has Downs syndrome.

Tim Harris, 26, opened the restaurant in 2010 with the help of his parents but it’s success since then has been down to his ideas and enthusiastic approach which has made it a regular haunt for countless locals.

The most popular item on the menu is also Tim’s specialty – hugs. Customers can actually order a free hug from Tim.

According to the menu a Tim Hug is ‘calorie-free’ and ‘guilt-free’ treat that guarantees to ‘improve your lease on life.’ 

'I love giving all the customers a hug because I want them to feel comfortable and connected and being around friends,' Harris told Albuquerque The Magazine.

As well as profits, Tim measures his success in terms of hugs and so far he's given out over 30,000 of them. The restaurant even has a hug counter hung on the wall.

Since he was born, Tim has been proving the doubters wrong and overachieving at everything he has taken on. In high school, Harris was elected homecoming king and Student Of The Year.

It was while at high school that Tim first worked as a host at a Red Robin restaurant in Albuquerque. During this time, he learned a lot about welcoming guests at a restaurant and developed a loyal following of customers.

He is also a college graduate, an accomplished Special Olympian, an excellent sailor and an experienced offshore fisherman.

Tim's parents Keith and Jeannie have raised him just as they have his three brothers to set themselves high-expectations.

‘All of us who are dads want our kids to wind up independent, happy, secure,’ his father Keith Harris explained to CBS.

A small business owner himself, he provided the initial investment in Tim’s Place, other people do the managing and cooking, but Tim is the front man and the genius behind its welcoming and family friendly ambiance.

The restaurant is open seven days a week serving breakfast, lunch and of course hugs. Business is booming and Tim even has expansion plans.

Meanwhile he is also very happy to provide a positive role model for other people with Down syndrome.

'We've had several families with young children with disabilities who have come in or written and said, "I never thought this would be possible for my son or daughter," his mother told KRQE News 13.

'It's changing the way they're thinking as they're raising their young children.'

'I tell people with disabilities that they can follow their dreams,' added Tim.
