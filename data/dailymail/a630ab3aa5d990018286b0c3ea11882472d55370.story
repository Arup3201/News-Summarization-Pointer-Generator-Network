There's nothing like snuggling up to mum, especially when she’s as big and cuddly as Kibriah the orangutan. 

In fact, Kibriah and her two-week-old baby have stayed so close that staff at Twycross Zoo, Leicestershire, haven’t yet been able to get near enough to determine the newborn’s gender and so give it a name.

The zoo’s head of life sciences, Dr Charlotte Macdonald, said: ‘When keepers arrived in the morning they were delighted to find Kibriah had given birth overnight.

The mother and her newborn baby are so inseparable, zookeepers have not been able to get close enough to determine the baby's gender

'Although 36-year-old Kibriah isn’t a first time mum, this is her first baby in 12 years so we’re all very pleased with how well she’s doing.

She’s very confident and relaxed with the infant, and enjoying plenty of rest.’

The baby’s father is 24-year-old Batu, who has not yet been introduced to his latest child.

The zoo is breeding the primates as part of the European Breeding Programme of endangered apes.
