Nick Clegg and Lib Dem  Cabinet ministers are today accused of plotting to persuade business leaders to undermine David Cameron’s historic stand against a new EU treaty.

In an email leaked to the Mail, the heads of blue chip firms are asked to sign up to a letter demanding that the Government ‘re-engages’ with Brussels.

It is being circulated by leading City lobbyist Roland Rudd following a meeting with Mr Clegg, Vince Cable, Danny Alexander and Chris Huhne. It says it is ‘imperative’ that Britain is not left on the ‘outside’ when important  decisions are taken on the future of Europe.

The plotters (clockwise from top left): Nick Clegg, Vince Cable, Danny Alexander and Chris Huhne were all involved in a meeting earlier this week with a city lobbyist who later sent an email to business leaders telling them to back the Liberal Democrats' position on Europe

The revelation prompted cries of treachery from Tory MPs and raised fears that the issue of Europe could fracture the Coalition – which is under the greatest strain since it was formed.

Mr Clegg had initially backed the Prime  Minister’s use of the veto, but flip-flopped after a furious reaction from his own party.

The attempt by Mr Rudd, a close friend of former EU commissioner Lord Mandelson, to influence Government policy will raise further concerns about the power wielded by lobbyists.

Revelations about the influence of Liam Fox’s unofficial adviser Adam Werritty prompted the Defence Secretary’s resignation. Lobbyists at PR firm Bell Pottinger, meanwhile, were secretly taped boasting of their access to the Cabinet.

Summit: Roland Rudd chaired the meeting with the ministers earlier this week before later sending the email to business leaders

Last night there were fresh signs that the EU agreement to create a new ‘fiscal union’, which Mr Cameron refused to endorse at a crunch summit last week, is already crumbling. Hungary and the Czech Republic suggested they would not sign up unless plans to harmonise tax rates across the Continent are dropped.

France, meanwhile, stepped up its attacks on Britain as the head of the French central bank insisted the UK should be stripped of its gold-plated credit rating before his own country.

Mr Clegg, who refused to attend Mr Cameron’s Commons statement on the summit, has told Cabinet colleagues the Government must now ‘re-engage with our European partners’.

Earlier this week, he attended a meeting chaired by Mr Rudd, chairman of pro-EU group Business for New Europe, and also attended by Business Secretary Mr Cable, Treasury Chief Secretary Mr Alexander and Energy Secretary Mr Huhne.

In the leaked email, sent yesterday, Mr Rudd, founder of PR firm Finsbury, touts for signatures for a letter from business leaders backing the Deputy Prime Minister’s position.

‘Having had an extremely productive meeting with Nick Clegg and three of his Cabinet colleagues Vince Cable, Danny Alexander and Chris Huhne  yesterday, we are convinced now more than ever that it is necessary for business leaders to maintain public pressure on the Government to follow through on its promise to be fully engaged in the European Union following last week’s veto,’ it says.

‘We have been in touch with No 10, the Treasury and the Foreign Office, and they assure us that they would welcome this call.

‘We have drafted the following letter
 which we intend to run in the Telegraph next week. It seeks to make it 
crystal clear that we, as British business leaders, believe that it is 
vital that the UK engages, focuses on the single market and supports the
 EU’s institutions in helping the euro.

‘You will see that the letter is totally constructive and non-party political, as it must be in order to be most effective. It would be enormously helpful if you were able to add your name to it.’

The draft text of the letter says that the EU’s single market is of ‘great importance’ to the UK and accounts for more than half of the country’s trade.

‘But we must deepen and widen it, and push for reform in services, the digital arena and energy,’ it goes on.

Undermined? The meeting involving Mr Clegg and his colleagues came following David Cameron's decision to veto a new EU agreement

‘To do this we need to remain at the core of Europe, fighting for UK interests with our partners who share our desire for an open and liberal Europe. Whilst recognising that it is not desirable for the UK to join the euro, it is overwhelmingly in our interests that the currency survives, and we need to help where we can.'

The Prime Minister said in the House of Commons that the UK is “supportive of the role of the [European] institutions.” That is an important starting point as we seek to find a formula that will place us firmly amongst the 27 members of the European Union as we ensure that we continue to develop the single market.

‘It is imperative that we are not outside when important decisions are taken, and as opportunities arise over the coming months for Britain to re-engage in the decision making process in Europe, we must seize them.’

Lib Dem sources said it was no secret that Mr Clegg had been talking to business people about the issue of Europe and said the entire Coalition had agreed that Britain should ‘re-engage’ with the EU following last week’s veto.

Asked about Mr Rudd’s claim that he had been in touch with Downing Street, the Treasury and the Foreign Office to discuss the initiative, a Government spokesman said he was unaware of it.

Tory MP Stewart Jackson, who resigned as a Parliamentary aide earlier this year after backing an EU referendum, insisted Mr Clegg should ‘disown’ Mr Rudd’s initiative.

‘The public are not in the mood for Nick Clegg to be plotting with Eurofanatics,’ he said. ‘Mr Rudd’s opinions are somewhat undermined by the fact that he has been consistently wrong on the EU for years, particularly on the merits or otherwise of the single currency.’

A recent ComRes poll for the Open Europe think tank found that 69 per cent of managers at UK finance firms support a British veto on EU financial rules even if it reduces access to the single market.The survey of 500 bosses found that 56 per cent think that, on balance, the costs of EU financial regulation currently outweigh the benefits of the single market to the City, while 31 per cent disagree.

Many of Britain’s top businessmen applaud David Cameron’s boldness at last week’s euro summit.BAE Systems chairman Dick Olver, who heads one of the UK’s biggest exporters, said that David Cameron’s refusal to sign up to a new European fiscal accord was: ‘a brave thing to do and the right thing to do’.

Simon Wolfson, Tory peer and chairman of high street retailer, Next, said: ‘The Prime Minister was absolutely right. There is no point in having a veto if you’re never prepared to use it. The reassurances the Prime Minister wanted were to protect one of Britain’s most valuable industries and were entirely reasonable.’

Last night a spokesman for Mr Clegg said: ‘I don’t see how liaising with business and asking them to say what they want to see in terms of Britain’s relationship with Europe is doing anything other than taking forward the Government’s attempt to re-engage constructively with our EU partners.

Mr Rudd denied that the letter was ‘a Lib Dem thing’ and said his meeting with the four most senior members of the party was in his diary for months.

He said: ‘We had a breakfast which was a longstanding arrangement. We’ve had people from all political parties to our meetings. We happened to have a meeting that I grant you turned out to be interesting timing.’

Mr Rudd also denied that the letter was pushing a Lib Dem agenda.

He added: ‘The letter says clearly that this is about support for the single market, which is absolutely key to most businesses because half our trade is with the European union. It quotes the Prime Minister in the House of Commons about the possibility of using the EU institutions. We want to be at the core of the engine and seize opportunities to get back in there.

‘On that basis it is not a Lib Dem thing. It’s something that businesses think.’

He said Phillip Souta, a director of Business for New Europe, had ‘spoken to a lot of people’ about the letter, but admitted: ‘I don’t know if he’s had conversations with Conservative cabinet ministers – I suspect not – but a lot of people would have been aware of it.’
