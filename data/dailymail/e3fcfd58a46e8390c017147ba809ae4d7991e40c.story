The former wife of Sir Paul McCartney never authorised former Mirror editor Piers Morgan, or anybody else, to listen to her voicemails, she told the inquiry into press standards today.

Chat show host Morgan has previously told the inquiry he listened to a voicemail message left to Mills by Sir Paul, but refused to say when or where he heard it because he wanted to protect a 'source' - but did not suggest it had been Ms Mills.

Today Ms Mills said she had never authorised Morgan, or anybody, to access or listen to her voicemails, and neither had she ever played a recording to the former editor.

'I couldn't quite believe that he would even try to insinuate, a man that has written nothing but awful things about me for years, would relish in telling the court if I had played a voicemail message to him,' she said.

Ms Mills told the inquiry 
that in early 2001 she and Sir Paul had argued about a trip she was 
planning to Gujurat, and while she stayed with a friend in Middlesex he 
left a series of messages on her voicemail.

She said: 'In
the morning, when I woke up, there were many messages, but they were 
all saved messages which I did not quite understand, because normally 
they wouldn't be but I didn't think too much of it.

'I thought I must have pressed a wrong button.

'There were about 25 messages all asking for forgiveness of what had happened.

'One of them said, 'please forgive me' and sang a little ditty of one of his songs on the voicemail.

'So that afternoon I went back and all was forgiven.'

She told the hearing she had never recorded the messages and deleted them straight away.

Piers Morgan told the inquiry in December (pictured) he would not disclose a source who played him a tape of a message that Sir Paul left Mills

But she said she was then called by a former Trinity Mirror employee - who the inquiry heard was not a Daily Mirror journalist, nor anybody working under the supervision of Morgan - saying they had heard a recording of the message.

'I said, 'there's no way that you could know that unless you have been listening to my messages',' she told the inquiry. 'And he laughed.'

She said she threatened to take action if the story was published, and it wasn't.

But in 2006, in a piece in the Daily Mail, Morgan referred to having listened to the message.

Giving evidence in December, Morgan told the inquiry he would not disclose a source who played him a tape of a message that Sir Paul left Mills.

Ms Mills said she was told by detectives from Operation Weeting that they had evidence that her voicemails had been hacked

He said: 'I am not going to discuss where I heard it or who played it to me.

'I don't think it's right. In fact the inquiry has already stated to me you don't expect me to identify sources.'

Lord Justice Leveson told him the only person who would be able to lawfully listen to the message was Mills or somebody authorised on her behalf.

He told Morgan: 'I am perfectly happy to call Lady McCartney to give evidence as to whether she authorised you to listen to her voicemails.

'She may say she did in which case you're not compromising anybody, but if she didn't then we can proceed on the premise that it's somebody else, can't we.'

Asked by counsel for the inquiry Robert Jay QC: 'Did you authorise Mr Morgan to access your voicemail?', she replied 'never'.

He asked: 'Did you authorise Mr Morgan to listen to your voicemail?'

'Never ever,' she answered.

Ms Mills said that before 1999 press coverage of her had been positive

Mr Jay also asked: 'Have you ever played to Mr Morgan or authorised him to listen to a recording of this or any other voicemail left on your messaging system?', she replied 'Never, never'.

And asked if she had ever done this to anybody, she answered: 'No'.

Ms Mills said she was told by detectives from Operation Weeting that they had evidence that her voicemails had been hacked.

She then showed the court a home video which she had compiled of her interactions with paparazzi photographers.

A
man was captured trying to look through a fence surrounding her home 
saying: 'Someone should just bring a hand-drill down and put a hole 
though.'

One subtitle in the video read: 'Hunting Heather becomes a national sport.'

She told the inquiry she had 64 hours of footage of alleged harassment.

Ms Mills said that before 1999 press coverage of her had been positive but it became negative when she met Sir Paul.

She said: 'The second I met my ex-husband I became a one-legged bitch, and cow, and every awful word you could think of.'

Ms
Mills told the inquiry that no-win-no-fee agreements needed to ensure 
that newspapers would pick up entire costs of cases brought by people 
who have 'absolutely no money'.

'There are hundreds and hundreds of people out there who have been through horrific situations with papers making up stories and they have no recourse.'

She said the PCC should be a public body sat on by 'respected individual members of the public' for a year, meaning they could not be bribed, blackmailed, or threatened into making decisions.

Also giving evidence, the News of the World's former head of news told the inquiry he was told to deliberately mislead the McCanns' spokesman about the newspaper's plans to publish Kate McCann's diary.

Ian Edmondson said former editor Colin Myler told him to have a 'woolly' conversation with Clarence Mitchell about plans to publish Mrs McCann's diary so he did not know what the paper was planning.

Mrs McCann said she felt 'violated' when the private journal appeared in the newspaper on September 14 2008.

Mr Myler has said he would never have published it if he had realised she was not aware of the paper's plans, and claimed Mr Edmondson told him he had cleared the story with Mr Mitchell.

But Mr Edmondson said he was deliberately unclear in his conversation with Mr Mitchell, on the express instructions of Mr Myler.

'(Mr Myler) decided to ask me to make a call to Mr Mitchell, not make it clear what we had, telling him in general terms, basically make it woolly.

'He was frightened that if Clarence knew what we had, he might take action.'

He also told the inquiry there was a culture of bullying at the News of the World, of which Mr Myler was a part.

Mr Mitchell said today he felt vindicated by the evidence.

'I have always said the News of the World actively sought to deceive me over the publication of Kate's diary.

'But to hear that it was apparently done at the editor's direct behest was particularly shocking, if not surprising. Clearly, Mr Myler now has some serious questions to answer.

'The distress this episode caused Kate, Gerry and myself was immense. I am glad we are getting to the truth at last.'
