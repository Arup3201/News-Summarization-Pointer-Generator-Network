Fish skin from cod caught in the Atlantic is being used as a way to help kick-start the healing of chronic wounds.

It is estimated that at any one time, more than 200,000 patients have a  hard-to-heal wound, and the cost to the NHS is up to £3 billion a year.

A wound is defined as being chronic if it takes more than six weeks to heal.

Wounds that typically become chronic include foot ulcers (a common complication of diabetes which can lead to gangrene and amputation), pressure sores or bed sores, and leg ulcers (caused by high blood pressure).

This failure to heal can occur for a variety of reasons, ranging from poor blood and oxygen supply to a weakened immune system and low levels of growth factors necessary for healing tissue.

As a result, the scaffolding around which cells should gather to create new tissue to seal the wound does not work properly, leaving it open and inflamed, sometimes for years.

A wide range of treatments have been used, including antibiotics, new types of dressings and ultrasound.

The idea behind the new treatment, known as Fish Skin Extracellular Matrix (ECM), is to provide a natural scaffolding to help new tissue grow and to complete the healing process.

The advantage of fish skin is that it similar to human skin, with the addition of omega 3 oils (which reduces inflammation to boost healing).

The fish skin comes from cod farmed in the North Atlantic off Iceland. It is processed to remove most of the cells — leaving the connective tissue and fat behind — and then sterilised.

This is placed over the wound. Over time, the fish skin is converted into living, human tissue.

Small trials conducted by Kerecis, the Iceland-based company behind the treatment, have shown promising results.

In one, ten patients with serious non-healing wounds received the treatment for 28 days.

All the wounds treated improved, with six completely healing. None of the wounds had responded to hospital-standard treatment for at least six months before the trial started.

In another study involving 37 patients, a year after treatment 36 of the patients had improved — the 37th did not improve but the wound did not get worse, according to Dr Baldur Tumi Baldursson, medical director of Kerecis.

It’s hoped that the fish skin could also be used in surgery for hernia repair and breast reconstruction, again as a scaffold for new tissue to grow on.

Dr Richard Warren, a consultant dermatologist at Salford Royal NHS foundation Trust and the University of Manchester said: ‘Chronic non-healing wounds are a huge issue for patients, causing enormous suffering, and are often resistant to treatment.

‘Thus, any new effective therapy would be most welcome.

'This new technology has been tested on some patients with encouraging results and has recently been approved for use in the U.S.

‘It is, however, important to recognise that tests so far have been in small numbers of patients and its true effectiveness is yet to be fully appreciated.
