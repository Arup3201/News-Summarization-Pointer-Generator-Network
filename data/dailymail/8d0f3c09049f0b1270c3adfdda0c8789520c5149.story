Former Major General Christopher Elliott has warned the MOD need to stand up to politicians to prevent more military defeats in the future 

Military chiefs must stand up to politicians and stop passively accepting plans or Britain will lose more wars, a former Major General has warned. 

Christopher Elliott highlights infighting and a fear to question senior officials, as key factors in the defeats suffered by Britain in the last decade.

The former Major General's critique of the military's handling of the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq is contained in a new book High Command, based on interviews with military figures and those in the Ministry of Defence over two years. 

His interviews expose a dysfunctional leadership within the army and are published ahead of the Chilcot Inquiry into the Iraq war. 

'At the moment the UK is bound to fall in its face unless someone makes an honest appreciation of what they want [armed] forces for,' he told The Times. 

The book also highlights major decisions often being taken by two senior politicians with the MOD tasked with making plans fit rather than questioning them. 

'The result of all this was that the MoD became absorbed with making plans work, instead of pausing sufficiently to probe whether the plans themselves were workable,' Mr Elliott wrote. 

Oxford University Press describes High Command: British Military Leadership in the Iraq and Afghanistan Wars, as 'a scathing indictment of the military's decisions in Iraq and Afghanistan.'

Elliott's book explores the reasons behind the failures in the military campaigns, citing a lack of ownership and involvement in key decisions by senior Army figures.

He quotes Lord West of Spithead, head of the Navy at the time, as saying he found out about things 'after they had been decided and I often didn't know where a decision had been made.'

The warnings are contained in Mr Elliott's book High Command, composed of interviews and research 

The book also exposes infighting, with naval officers admitting to jealousy over the amount of publicity soldiers in Afghanistan received because of the scale of deaths.

Major General Christopher Elliott CBE retired from the army in 2002, having held a number of senior appointments in the Ministry of Defence, including Director of Military Operations, Commander 6, Armoured Brigade, Director of the Higher Command and Staff Course.
