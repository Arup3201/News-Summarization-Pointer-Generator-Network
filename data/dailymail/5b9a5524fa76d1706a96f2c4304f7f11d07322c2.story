A frightened dog has spent 14 hours stuck in the engine of a car – so well hidden that a mechanic working on the car's motor did not notice the confused pooch was there.

Spoodle Ollie was spooked by a Melbourne storm in the early hours of Monday morning when he ran away from home, seeking refuge in a dry, warm place.

Later that morning, Berwick resident Therese James's car inexplicably refused to start, but she was relieved when RACV mechanics were able to fix the problem without incident.

Before Ms James could drive away, she received a call which saved her neighbour's beloved pup's life.

When the car owner couldn't start her car, she called a mechanic. The mechanic fixed the car without noticing that Ollie was in the car motor and he wasn't located until hours later that day

Ms James was completely unaware that the missing pooch was entangled in her car's engine bay.

'Luckily my boss told me to work from home because I would've driven to work and who knows what could've happened,' Ms James told the Berwick Leader.

Unbelievably, Ollie had managed to crawl up through the engine mount into the car's engine but quickly became very stuck.

The four-year-old pup was located 13 hours later, when his frantic owner Caroline O'Reilly called out his name – and heard Ollie's cries coming from her neighbour's Mitsubishi Lancer.

'As I knocked and called out ... he heard me and started to cry,' Ms O'Reilly told the Berwick Ledaer.

'I looked under the car and noticed his tail hanging out when I looked under the car — he was shaking and we tried for at least an hour before RACV came out to dismantle a couple of pieces.'

Narre Warren CFA First Lieutenant Travis Carter was one of seven fire fighters who released Ollie from the car

The ladies called Narre Warren CFA after trying to remove Ollie from the engine compartment for an hour.

Ms O'Reilly said she had feared for Ollie's life.

'It could have been a different outcome,' she told Berwick News.

'I did start to panic a little bit, I thought he'd stopped breathing, but all was good.

'I was very relieved.'

Seven firefighters were required to remove Ollie, as well as several car parts, in 35 minutes.

They 'didn't have high hopes' when they were working to extract the dog. 

The sweet spoodle initially 'didn't look very well' due to the stress of his ordeal, but it only took a couple of cuddles and some well-deserved TLC to return Ollie to cheery self. 

'When we got him out his tail was wagging, and the owner held him and he looked like a happy dog,' Narre Warren CFA First Lieutenant Travis Carter told Berrick News.

'We've had a few animal call-outs, but the engine compartment is a first for me.'

Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Ms James' vehicle, with Ollie creating around $7000 worth of damage to the wiring alone, when he tried to chew his way out.

'As I knocked and called out ... he heard me and started to cry,' Ms O'Reilly said.

'I looked under the car and noticed his tail hanging out when I looked under the car — he was shaking and we tried for at least an hour before RACV came out to dismantle a couple of pieces,' said Ms O'Reilly.

It's likely Ollie now is far more terrified of cars than he ever was of thunderstorms.
