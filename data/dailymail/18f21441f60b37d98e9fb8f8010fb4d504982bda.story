If Holland are to go on and achieve something significant here over the next two weeks then one moment from this extraordinary afternoon in north-east Brazil will be frozen in time.

The image — shown afterwards by the host broadcaster here — is of Wesley Sneijder, caught mid-strike, head and knee perfectly over the ball, as he catches an 88th-minute volley flush on the sweet spot of his right boot.

It shows a world-class sportsman — no doubt exhausted after an hour-and-a-half of play in extreme conditions — in perfect control of his body, all outside pressures and influences rendered irrelevant by concentration and calm.

A moment that saved Holland from expulsion, it would have been ruined had Sneijder shown anything other than the most remarkable assurance. He, of all the people here, knew he was going to score.

Elsewhere, 
they will maybe talk about other things. The Mexicans will want to talk 
about the penalty that subsequently won Holland  the game. Louis van 
Gaal seemed very keen afterwards to talk about his own tactical 
expertise. More of that when he comes to Manchester and we will all be 
asleep.

This,
 though, was a match rescued by a moment of perfection. The heroic 
Mexico goalkeeper Guillermo Ochoa — sadly now on his way home — hardly 
saw  Sneijder’s shot. It flew past him like a missile. When he watches 
it again on TV, maybe he will shrug. The great players, no matter how 
poorly they are playing, produce great moments when it matters.

And
 Sneijder had played badly. He is past his best. South Africa 2010 was 
his time. As Holland  rallied, he was outshone by Arjen Robben and, as 
strange as it sounds, Dirk Kuyt.

If
 you have a player like Sneijder, though, you keep him on and you wait. 
‘I have seen him deliver  that type of shot so many times in the last 
two years,’ said Van Gaal afterwards. ‘He is also one of the fittest 
players in the squad.’

Everybody
 had to be fit. It was 38 degrees on the field. In the stands,
 you needed leather skin. Either that or a big hat.

As
 it was, many of the supporters unfortunate enough to be seated in the 
sun retreated to the shade at the rear. The heat affected the game but 
did not reduce the drama.

Finish: Giovani dos Santos gave Mexico the lead in the 48th minute with a brilliant strike

Off it: Van Persie struggled to make an impact in Fortaleza and was substituted in the second half

FIFA
 allowed the teams a water break in each half. Van Gaal admitted he used
 the second one like an American time-out to change his tactics and 
drill new instructions into the brains of his weary players.

It
 worked. Prior to the Mexico goal, Holland had been desperately poor. A 
five-man defence that attracts criticism in Holland often resembled an 
orange wall of seven as holding midfield players retreated into the 
backline whenever Mexico had the ball.

All
 it did for an hour was invite Mexico to attack, and they did. The 
Central Americans could and should have scored in the first half. Miguel
 Layun twice threatened from distance and  Hector Herrera had a great 
sight of goal  in the 17th minute.

Holland,
 deprived of the injured Nigel de Jong after only 10 minutes, created 
one chance that Robin van Persie wasted with a poor touch and should 
have been given a penalty when Robben was fouled by Rafael Marquez and 
Hector Moreno in the 44th minute.

Van
 Gaal’s team needed to improve but it didn’t happen until after Mexico 
had scored. It was a fine strike, the terrific Giovani dos Santos firing
 past Jasper Cillessen from 25 yards with his left foot.

Foul? Holland could have been given a penalty after this Moreno tackle of Robben

Battle: Carlos Salcido challenges Van Persie for the ball during the first 45 minutes

Injury: Hector Moreno is helped by the Mexican medical staff during the first half

Certainly,
 it was question time for Holland and, to their credit, they responded. 
Robben carried the biggest threat and Kuyt was unstinting, playing left 
wing back, right back and centre forward in Van Gaal’s reshuffles.

Chances
 did come but the Dutch couldn’t take them and when Ochoa somehow saved a
 point-blank volley from Stefan de Vrij on the hour, it was tempting to 
wonder if it just wasn’t Holland’s day.

Sneijder
 saw a shot deflected narrowly over after Robben had set him up and the 
Bayern Munich winger appealed again for a penalty with 22 minutes to go.
 This time he looked as though he had dived.

Ouch: Hector Herrera (centre) is kicked in the head by Aston Villa's Ron Vlaar (right)

Brave: Herrera managed to come away from this challenge without a serious injury

Hot: Mexico take on fluids during a cooling break with the temperature close to 40 degrees

Ochoa then saved with his knee at the near post from Robben and defender Ron Vlaar headed over from the resulting corner.

Soon
 after Van Persie was hauled off and replaced by Klaas-Jan Huntelaar. 
That was to prove vital. First, though, Holland had to equalise and 
Sneijder seized his moment when Robben floated a corner to the far post 
and Memphis Depay backpedalled to cleverly head down towards the space 
his team-mate had found.

Back in the game, Holland looked set for extra-time. Some physical challenge that would have been.As
 it was, controversy arrived. Robben escaped to the byline and fell over
 Marquez’s foot. A dive or a foul? Perhaps it was a bit of both and 
Huntelaar stepped up to win this knockout tie with a swish of his right 
foot.

It was the moment that won an incredible game. It wasn’t, though, the one for which it should be remembered.
