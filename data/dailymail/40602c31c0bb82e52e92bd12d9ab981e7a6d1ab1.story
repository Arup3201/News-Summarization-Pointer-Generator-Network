A thief who broke into the home of a 92-year-old vulnerable woman before ripping a 24-hour care alarm from her neck and demanding money has been described as a 'desperate coward'.

The victim was sat watching TV in her living room when the masked attacker broke in through a window, pulled her Careline pendant from her neck and began shaking her while demanding cash.

He stole her purse containing a small amount of cash and fled from the house on Springfield Road, Kearsley, Greater Manchester.

'Reprehensible': The thief broke in to the home of a vulnerable 92-year-old woman in Kearsley, Greater Manchester, pictured, before demanding money

The woman was taken to hospital as a precaution and kept in for observations.

Police described the burglar as a 'desperate coward' and said even fellow criminals will be appalled by the attack.

They are now trying to hunt down the thief and have appealed for information about the incident around 9.20pm on Saturday night.

Defenceless: The burglar also ripped a 24-hour care alarm from the pensioner's neck so she couldn't call for help

Detective Sergeant Lee Shaw, of Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said: 'To break into the home of a 92-year-old woman is bad enough, but to then physically attack this woman - who is clearly vulnerable and has no capacity to defend herself - is reprehensible and the actions of a desperate coward.

'He has subjected this woman and her family to a completely unnecessary and frightening ordeal for the sake of just a few pounds.

'I want anyone who was in the area at the time and who may have seen something to come forward.

'I am confident someone will know who has done this and I want the associates and friends of this person to think about what he has done and tell us who he is.

'There is no room for loyalty in crimes as wicked as this and even the criminal fraternity will be appalled that someone can stoop so low.

'Next time it could be your mother or grandmother and we want to ensure justice is done for this woman and her family so if you do know anything please contact us in complete confidence.'

Anyone with information is asked to call police on 0161 856 5608, or Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.
