Scientists think they have solved the mystery of why some rogue planets exist in space without orbiting a star.

Astronomers from Sweden and Finland believe orphan planets with no parent star can form in tiny, cold dust clouds in space.

Research has shown there could be as many as 200 billion 'free-floating' planets in our galaxy alone.

The Rosette Nebula (pictured) is a huge cloud of gas and dust 4,600 light years from Earth which harbours hundreds of 'globulettes (inset). Orphan planets with no parent star can form in tiny, round dark clouds that are flying through space at 80,000 kilometres per hour, scientists believe

Until now it was assumed that such 'rogue planets' must have been ejected from their solar systems.

But new observations point to the likelihood of some free-floating worlds forming on their own.

Astronomers used several telescopes to observe the Rosette Nebula, a huge cloud of gas and dust 4,600 light years from Earth in the constellation of Monoceros, the Unicorn.

The nebula is home to more than 100 of the unusual planet-forming clouds, dubbed 'globulettes'.

Each has a diameter less than 50 times the distance between the Sun and the planet Neptune.

Dr Carina Persson, from Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden, said: 'We found that the globulettes are very dense and compact, and many of them have very dense cores.

'That tells us that many of them will collapse under their own weight and form free-floating planets. The most massive of them can form so-called brown dwarfs.'

Brown dwarfs, sometimes called failed stars, are bodies whose mass lies between that of planets and stars.

The tiny clouds are speeding outwards through the Rosette Nebula at around 80,000 kilometres per hour, the astronomers found.

Their results are published in the latest edition of the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics.

Co-author Minja Makela, from the University of Helsinki in Finland, said: 'We think that these small, round clouds have broken off from tall, dusty pillars of gas which were sculpted by the intense radiation from young stars.

'They have been accelerated out from the centre of the nebula thanks to pressure from radiation from the hot stars in its centre.'

The scientists believe countless millions of nebulae such as the Rosette have bloomed and faded away during the Milky Way’s long history. Many could have given birth to free-floating planets. 

Professor Gosta Gahm, from Stockholm University in Sweden, who led the research, said: 'If these tiny, round clouds form planets and brown dwarfs, they must be shot out like bullets into the depths of the Milky Way.'

'There are so many of them that they could be a significant source of the free-floating planets that have been discovered in recent years.'
