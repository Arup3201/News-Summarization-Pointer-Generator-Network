Britain is launching a battle against EU plans to force the government to allow non-Europeans a benefit allowance.

They have been angered by an EU proposal to sign a deal with Turkey without Britain’s agreement, which could mean Turkish citizens’ would gain access to the UK welfare system.

Chris Grayling, the employment minister, has told British officials in Brussels to argue against the plans later this month, which encroach further on British sovereignty.

Under fire: Brussels is planning to sign a deal with Turkey without Britain's consent that could extend its citizens' access to the UK social security system

He is concerned that the move will pave the way for welfare deals with 
other countries outside the EU.

Mr Grayling said: 'The government takes the very firm view there should be no opening up of our welfare system to people coming from abroad who do not intend to work and contribute to British society.

'Our arrangements are for Britain to decide, not Brussels. I’m not happy with the way that the EU is behaving. Europe should not be negotiating social security agreements on our behalf, that’s why we’re going through the courts to stop them,' reported The Sunday Times.

The deal will not suddenly allow Turkish migrants to claim a pension - the UK already has a treaty with Turkey dating from 1961 which gives access to social security benefits.

Instead Britain’s concern is the principle of the EU meddling – there are implications that once Brussels has gained power over who can receive benefits, it could be extended in the future.

In theory, this could mean citizens of other countries could claim benefits in Britain without the government's consent.

The move could lead to the Britain forking out millions more in welfare payments, curtailing attempts to cut the deficit.

There are also concerns that  encourage it could benefit tourists to exploit Britain’s welfare system.

But the European commission said the deal would simply mean migrant workers were not put at a financial disadvantage when moving between states.

It stated that Turkish migrants will not suddenly be able to claim pension benefits, unless they have contributed by working in the country and the move was to 'simplify administrative arrangement.'

'It is highly misleading and irresponsible to suggest that the proposal fora Council Decision concerning the EU position on social security coordination with Turkey would create any new rights for non-EU workers – it would not. The proposal would simply facilitate the administration of existing rights,' said a Commission spokesperson.

'This proposed new decision creates new reciprocal rights for EU workers who have worked in Turkey,' he added.

Some government officials see the move by the European Commission as sneaky - the Lisbon treaty, which became law in 2009, gave Britain the ability to agree or disagree on agreements between Brussels and non-EU countries.

But the commission is trying to push through the deal a part of the treaty that is usually reserved to govern relations between member states.

Turkey, which has a population of 75 million citizens, has been trying to join the EU for years.

British Prime Minister David Cameron has previously backed the country's accession, and points to Turkey's growing economy as a reason.

Turkey's EU negotiations have 
previously been overshadowed by concerns about freedom of speech and 
democracy in Turkey and treatment of religious minorities, women's and 
children's rights.

There are also issues about civilian control of the military and the Cyprus tensions.
