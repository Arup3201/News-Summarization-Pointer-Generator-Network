Everton are watching Rochdale's versatile defender Rhys Bennett.

The 23-year-old started his career with Bolton before moving to Falkirk on loan and was then snapped up by Rochdale where he has impressed with his performances.

Bennett can play right back or centre back and Everton scouts have taken a keen interest in recent weeks as they look to strengthen their squad following injury to John Stones and veteran Sylvain Distin turning 37 next month.

Bennett signed a new two year contract earlier this year and Rochdale will be looking for around £1million if Everton firm up their interest.

The Toffees currently sit 10th in the Premier League table and take on West Ham at Goodison Park next Saturday.
