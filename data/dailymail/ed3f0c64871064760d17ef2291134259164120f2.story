A fully-working replica of the first-ever passenger train has launched a month of festivities on one of the world's oldest railways.

The replica of the 1825 Robert Stephenson-designed Locomotion No. 1 is marking 175 years since iron rails were laid on the route in County Durham.

Having used wooden rails since 1725, experts said it heralded a new era of transport and mining in the area.

Historic: A replica of the first ever passenger train steams along the world's oldest railway today to celebrate an industrial landmark

Steam: It is a fully working replica of Robert Stephenson's Locomotion No. 1, the first ever locomotive train to carry passengers between Darlington and Stockton in 1825

Coal: It travelled along the world's oldest railway line, Tanfield Railway in County Durham to mark 175 years since iron rails were introduced on the line

Big event: In 1839 iron rails were used for the tracks, which is thought to be one of the earliest-recorded cases of modernisation in transport infrastructure

Movement: Trains like the Locomotion No. 1 took coal from the Tanfield area, near Stanley, to the River Tyne at Dunston on the Tanfield Railway line

Innovative: Stephenson's Locomotion No. 1 was the first steam locomotive to run on a passenger line

Trains like the Locomotion No. 1 took coal from the Tanfield area to the River Tyne at Dunston on the Tanfield Railway line, near Sunniside, Gateshead.

Tanfield Railway director David Watchman said: ‘This is perhaps one of the earliest-recorded cases of modernisation in transport infrastructure.

‘The rebuilding with iron rails made possible the introduction of steam to the route and the collieries it served, both in the shape of stationary engines and locomotives.’

Stephenson's Locomotion No. 1 was the first steam locomotive to run on a passenger line. It made its debut on September 27, 1825 on the Stockton and Darlington Railway.

The replica steamed into action at Marley Hill, near Gateshead, this morning and will be running tomorrow and next weekend.

Mr Watchman added: ‘We know that Marley Hill colliery was the location for some of the first locomotives introduced to the route and that they were very similar to Locomotion.

On the tracks: The locomotive made its debut on September 27, 1825 on the Stockton and Darlington Railway

Fire it up: The replica steamed into action at Marley Hill, near Gateshead, this morning and will be running tomorrow and next weekend

Hopes: The Tanfield Railway director said he wanted to highlight a 'virtually forgotten era of the North East's railway history'

Coming out: The fully-working replica of the first ever passenger train launched a month of festivities on one of the world's oldest railways

Gauge: Having used wooden rails since 1725, experts said the change in 1825 to iron heralded a new era of transport and mining in the area

Years ago: The Tanfield Railway in the 1700s before the Age of Steam, with horses hauling coal carts from Durham coalfields to the River Tyne

‘This visit is about highlighting this 
exciting and important, but virtually forgotten, era of the North East's
 railway history.’

'This is perhaps one of the earliest-recorded cases of modernisation in transport infrastructure'

David Watchman, Tanfield Railway director

According to the Tanfield Railway website, when the line was built in 1725 it was 'unlike anything else in its era, or even since the Roman Empire.

'It was a triumph of engineering over nature, a clear signal that a new industrial age was upon the world, and that railways would play a massive part.'

The event this weekend come 11 years before the railway celebrates its tricentenary in 2025. The line is now maintained and operated by volunteers.

An even older part of the railway called the Lobley Hill section was built around 1647 and had been going for more than 300 years when it shut in 1964.
