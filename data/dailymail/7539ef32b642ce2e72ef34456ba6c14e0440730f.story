Joshua Smart was allegedly shot in the back by his girlfriend's sister in April

A Sydney man who was shot in the back earlier this year was embroiled in a 'Romeo and Juliet' style romance with the alleged gunman's sister, a court has heard.

Joshua Smart, 24, and his father Michael Smart, 49, were gunned down in April just outside their family home in Pyrmont.

Michael Smart was shot in the head and hospitalised in a critical condition, and is now a cripple in the full-time care of his daughter.

His son Joshua, who was shot in the back, was on parole and charged with concealing an indictable offence after police alleged he knew who their attacker was.

On Thursday the background behind the alleged shooting was aired, as Smart's barrister Charles Waterstreet made an unsuccessful attempt to get his client bail.

The Supreme Court heard that Smart is locked in an ongoing dispute with the family of his girlfriend Monique Farrell, with whom he had a 'volatile relationship'.

Ms Farrell's brother Corey George Farrell has been charged over the double shooting and is also facing accusations of large-scale money laundering, the court heard.

Smart is alleged to have taken photos of himself holding a revolver, ammunition, and a police badge and spoke of 'a bullet for each' just days before the shooting.

'It is asserted that he was going to use the hand gun to inflict death,' Justice Richard Button said.

Days later, he and his father were shot - prompting Smart to allegedly send a text to Ms Farrell saying: 'Ur bro just shot me and my Dad' (sic).

Smart's blood was later found on the phone from which this SMS was allegedly sent, the court heard.

Mr Waterstreet, Smart's barrister, said Smart had been threatened by his lover's family.

'This is what happens in Romeo and Juliet,' Mr Waterstreet told the court, adding the star-crossed lovers had now reconciled and Ms Farrell had visited Smart six times since he has been in custody.

'He doesn't act. He sends messages, yes, but he doesn't act. He is not found with any gun. He is not found with any weapon. Basically, he is all talk,' Mr Waterstreet said.

He also said since Farrell had been in custody for the offences, Smart had been a target of attacks in prison.

He was on parole at the time of the shooting and charged with concealing an indictable offence after police alleged he knew who their attacker was

Mr Waterstreet said his client had a 'reasonable explanation' to conceal the alleged shooting as he feared he was going to be 'hit' if he opened his mouth.

But Justice Button refused bail, saying that at the time when Smart was allegedly in possession of a revolver he was on parole for recklessly causing grievous bodily harm in company.

The matter will return to court at a later date.
