A teenage girl was given just months to live after daily 18-hour alcohol binges left her body ravaged.

Phoebe Haffenden would consume an astonishing six litres of cheap cider a day, and at the age of 19 was warned by doctors that her body was close to shutting down.

The teenager, who is still 19, from New Milton in Hampshire, started drinking at just 15, but her habit spiralled out of control and she was soon drinking a litre of vodka at a time.

Phoebe Haffenden (pictured with her mother, Kate) started drinking when she was 15 and by the time she was 16 she was addicted to alcohol

Her addiction became so extreme she was kicked out of her family home and would suffer uncontrollable shakes and terrifying hallucinations.

Despite a happy childhood and a stable upbringing with mother, Kate, 39, a cleaner, and brother Ben, 17, Phoebe flew off the rails as the addiction took hold of her.

At her worst, the once-shy schoolgirl would even wake to find herself in bed with strangers who she had forgotten having sex with.

Phoebe first started drinking as a way to increase her confidence, but by the age of 16 she had developed a problem. By the time she was 18, she had totally hit rock bottom.

Phoebe said: ‘I couldn’t stop and I was soon hitting the bottle from 10am to about 3am or 4am the next morning.

‘I was running out of money and soon turned to cheap cider to feed my addiction.’

And with her new-found drunken confidence came outrageous promiscuity and a string of one-night stands.

‘I got myself into some awkward positions when I was drinking,’ said Phoebe. ‘I had quite a few one night stands that I do regret.

‘There was one night when I went to a party with a friend and I didn’t know the guy I woke up next to.

‘I was confused where I was and my friend had to explain what had happened. Most of the nights were a blur.’

The sixth form student struggled to keep up with her studies as debilitating hangovers left her unable to attend classes and she would often skip lessons to while away hours in the pub.

Phoebe (pictured aged 18) was told that if she did not stop drinking she would die within a few months as her body was shutting down

Phoebe (pictured at the age of five with her brother) said: 'I couldn't stop and I was soon hitting the bottle from 10am to about 3am or 4am the next morning. I was running out of money and soon turned to cheap cider'

‘I knew I had a problem,’ said Phoebe. ‘I would watch EastEnders and the storyline when Lauren Branning was drinking and cry.

‘I knew deep down that parts of her character were like mine. I was so scared.’

And as her money started to dwindle away, Phoebe started drinking bottles of cheap cider to satisfy her habit.

‘When I was drinking cider I was spending anything between £3 and £10 a day but when I was on a massive binge I could spend £50 to £100 a night.

‘The most I’ve spent in one night is about £250 on alcohol.’

'I knew I had a problem,' said Phoebe (pictured age six). 'I watched EastEnders and the storyline when Lauren Branning was drinking and cry. I knew deep down that parts of her character were like mine. I was so scared'

On one occasion, Phoebe (pictured at 17) spent £250 on alcohol in one night

‘The arguments between me and my family were horrendous - it got so bad they asked me to leave,’ she added.

‘I was sleeping on friend’s sofas and floors and there were times where I came very close to sleeping rough.

‘I could walk the streets until 4am before I’d find somewhere to crash.’

A couple of months later she ended up in the resuscitation room because of self-harming and excess drinking.

Doctors told Phoebe that if she carried on drinking she would be dead within a few months.

Phoebe's alcoholism meant she became extremely promiscuous and had numerous one night stands with men she didn't know

She said: ‘That was the turning point seeing how distraught and heartbroken I was making my mum, I had to stop being so selfish and think about my family.’

After a four-year battle with alcohol, in July this year, Phoebe spent ten days in a detox clinic and is starting to get her life back on track.

She was told that she had a kidney infection and her body was so dependent on alcohol that to go cold turkey could have killed her.

Instead she was weaned off gradually, using withdrawal medication.

Fortunately her body is young and will repair itself from any damage caused by the alcohol, but if she drinks again she could risk overdose.

Now Phoebe is back at home and has started an acting course at her local college.

She hopes to use her experiences to help other young addiction sufferers.

‘Everyone thinks it’s old men that drink and get an addiction,’ she said. ‘But it’s so accessible and can quickly become a problem to young people too.

‘I’m looking forward to the year ahead and putting all my energy into making my family proud of me,’ she added. ‘I’m taking one day at a time but I’m loving it.’
