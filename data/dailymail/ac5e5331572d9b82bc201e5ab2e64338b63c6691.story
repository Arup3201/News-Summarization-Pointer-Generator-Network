An experienced midwife whose 'catastrophic mistakes' led to the death of a baby boy has told an inquest: 'I will regret what happened for the rest of my life.'

Julie Richards was speaking after a coroner heard how 'gross failure' at an NHS hospital caused Noah Tyler to be starved of oxygen, a condition from which he never recovered.

The inquest heard that Noah died aged 10 months because of errors made during his birth at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff.

Problems during the birth also put the life of Noah's mother, Colleen Tyler, 31, in danger, the inquest in Cardiff was told.

Mrs Tyler and her husband Hywel are suing the hospital for negligence.

Mrs Richards, who had 13 years' experience of delivering babies, admitted to making 'catastrophic mistakes' by failing to take action when Noah’s heart rate was dangerously high.

'With hindsight I would have acted differently,' she said. 'I don’t know if I looked at the heart scan properly.

'If I had I would have sent her (Colleen) immediately upstairs to see specialist doctors.

'The raised heart level could have meant foetal distress but it could have been because the mother was in discomfort.

'I chose the more innocent option.'

She added: 'I will regret what happened for the rest of my life.'

Noah was born in the hospital's maternity unit in February last year.

Mrs Richards, who no longer works as a midwife, said: 'I thought Colleen was pushing so well and the baby was imminent.

'Her blood pressure was extremely high and I was very concerned with the reading.

'I was wrapped up in the delivery of the baby - I didn’t think we needed to call the specialist neo-natal team.

'When he was born I didn’t expect him to be in the condition he was in.

'He was as bad as a baby could be. He was pale and his heart rate was less than 60 and we took him away to be resuscitated.'

Earlier Mrs Tyler sobbed as she told the inquest how she was 'tortured' by the memory of baby Noah’s birth.

She said: 'I asked if I needed to push but the midwife told me if I needed to push I would not need to ask.

'She said I would just know but I was totally confused by this. I didn’t know whether I should push or not.

'After three hours they took me out of the birthing pool and put me into a bed.

'I kept asking for an epidural but they didn’t give me one.

'I asked if I needed a doctor but they told me there was no need to get the doctors involved because they would just cut me.

'In the end I told them they should do what they needed to to get my baby out.'

Mrs Tyler told the hearing that she knew instantly that something was wrong.

'I was told I would hear him cry when they got him out but I didn’t hear anything,' she said.

'He was very white, not how I expected him to look.

'No one said anything and I was left feeling confused. I was in a state of shock - I thought: “This cannot be happening”.

'I expected to be holding my baby by then but he wasn’t there.

'I knew from the doctor’s face that something terrible had happened.'

Noah was taken to an incubator where he was put on a cooling mat in an attempt to prevent his brain being damaged permanently.

Mrs Tyler, who is heavily pregnant, said: 'Nothing could prepare me for what I saw, that little thing lying in the incubator with loads of tubes going into him.

'I keep replaying the birth in my head and torturing myself. What if I could have done anything different to save Noah?

'The thoughts just go on and on.'

Mrs Tyler told how she later saw the midwife on the ward.

She said: 'I thanked her for doing everything she could to save Noah which I believed was the truth at the time.

'She didn’t say anything and looked very awkward.'

Specialists at the hospital treated Noah for months, but he showed little progress and he was moved to a children’s hospice.

He died two days before Christmas last year.

Pathologist Alistair Lammy told the inquest: 'Noah’s brain had been irreversibly damaged due to lack of blood and oxygen around or during birth.'

Cardiff coroner Mary Hassell said: 'I am very, very concerned with the circumstances surrounding Noah’s death.

'What struck me very forcibly was that we might today be dealing with two deaths rather than one.'

Miss Hassell recorded a narrative verdict saying Noah of natural causes 'contributed to by neglect'.

She said: 'Noah and his mother suffered gross failure of basic medical attention. There were failures.'

Speaking outside court, Mr Tyler said: 'It is because of the failings of one person that my boy isn’t here any more and there’s no reason why he shouldn’t be.

'We know it’s a good unit and the experience we’ve had with our new little boy proves they do know what they’re doing.

'When the coroner said this could have been an inquest around two deaths it hit me like a ton of bricks to think I could be here on my own not with my wife or our new little boy.'

The family’s solicitor, Stuart Bramley, said: 'We have heard about changes being made as a result.

'Colleen and Hywel Tyler hope that these changes will prevent other parents from having to live through the same nightmare.'

Cardiff and Vale University Health Board has admitted that the level of care to Mrs Tyler and Noah fell below the acceptable standard.
