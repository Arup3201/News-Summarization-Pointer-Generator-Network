As they hunted for arsonists and pitch invaders at White Hart Lane, Tottenham may have unearthed something far more valuable to Mauricio Pochettino: a turning point for the season.

Most teams in the Barclays Premier League are searching for the same thing, such is the inconsistency around the country, but the Spurs boss has conjured his third wins in eight days.

And this one seemed more significant than those against Partizan Belgrade and 10-man Hull City. This was a team proving to their manager they had spirit to respond after going behind early to a goal by Kevin Mirallas.

SUPER STAT: This was Roberto Soldado’s third goal from open play in 35 Premier League appearances since his £26million move from Valencia. He also has four penalties. 

They displayed great desire and energy in midfield to reverse the flow of the game and the grit to defend once Christian Eriksen and Roberto Soldado had turned it upside down.

For Soldado it was his first Premier League goal since March, and for Spurs a third home-win of the league campaign with three Academy graduates in their starting line-up.

That trio: Harry Kane, Ryan Mason and Nabil Bentaleb contributed greatly to the tempo and industry which underpinned a victory and eased Tottenham up to seventh, level with Arsenal.

There was a slice of fortune when Federico Fazio used an arm to block a goal-bound header from Romelu Lukaku during a frantic closing phase, and it went unnoticed, much to the annoyance of Roberto Martinez.

'Fazio makes himself really big and closes his eyes and he’s in a unusual position when it hits him,' fumed Martinez. 'If it hits him in the chest, no complaints, but it hits him in the arm and it should have been a penalty.

'I’m disappointed because Michael Oliver is a very good referee. It’s a real shame. This season, we haven’t been rewarded for good performances at Leicester, Manchester United and here. There are points we need to get back. But I would never blame a third party or the referee. We should be good enough to come to White Hart Lane and rely on ourselves.'

Martinez had seen his team take control in the 15th minute, with a beautiful curling shot by Mirallas when Spurs failed to clear a free-kick swung over from the left by Leighton Baines.

Mason headed out but only to the edge of the penalty area where Soldado lost a duel with Mirallas, who promptly set the ball on his right foot and bent a shot into the far corner.

Everton might have been ahead earlier in the game when a Gazza-style dribble by Ross Barkley was smothered on the edge of the penalty box, only for the ball to spill to the feet of Romelu Lukaku in front of goal.

Lukaku, wanted by Spurs when he left Chelsea in the summer, might have been offside but the flag stayed down. He hurried his shot and Hugo Lloris saved without fuss.

Spurs reacted well with great energy from their home-grown trio and were level within six minutes. Again it was a delightful finish, this time by Eriksen, but the goal owed much to Kane’s determination to threaten the goal.

Kane who cut in from wide on the Tottenham right, into space cleverly vacated by Soldado and unleashed an effort which took a slight deflection and flashed across the slick surface.

Tim Howard could not hold it and Eriksen was first onto the rebound, clipping a skilful finish over the Everton goalkeeper and Gareth Barry who had made ground to cover on the goal line.

Harry Kane was instrumental for Tottenham, particularly in the first-half as his hard work earned Spurs their two goals

Tottenham                                 121.6    75.5

Harry Kane                  90             13.0      8.1

Ryan Mason                90             12.9      8.0

Christian Eriksen        90              12.7      7.9

Gareth Barry               90            12.0       7.5

Seamus Coleman       90            11.4       7.1 

Spurs dominated until half-time with patches of attractive football. Howard thwarted Mason and Kane, while Eriksen went close with a deflected shot.

Then a poor header by Muhamed Besic, intended for his goalkeeper, fell short. Soldado had anticipated the error but his touch did not match his instinct and Besic escaped.

It seemed like it might be another of those days for Tottenham’s £26million Spaniard: culpable in Everton’s opener and able to do little right at the other end, when he struck, in first-half stoppage time.

Kane caught Barry deep in his own half, dithering in possession, and hooked the ball from him. Martinez wanted a free-kick but it would have been harsh. 

Aaron Lennon played in Soldado and this time his finish was clinical, past Howard and inside the post. 

Soldado has managed to remain dignified through his months of struggle in North London and supporters have refused to turn on him. As he headed down the tunnel at half-time, his name was ringing around White Hart Lane.

'The striker who doesn’t score is frustrated,' said Pochettino. 'It’s not easy and he felt the pressure but now he is happier and more free. It’s important to the team.'

Although they rode their luck at times, Everton stirred and summoned a bold finish, with Barkley proving increasingly influential.

Lloris made terrific save to block from Seamus Coleman after one of Barkley’s passes. Then came the penalty appeal for a Fazio handball, but Tottenham clung on and were cheered off by fans who have been critical at times this season.

'I understand why our supporters have been angry,' said Pochettino. 'If you lose four at home, it is difficult for them to be happy. You win away and lose at home is not the right way. But today the team have sent a different signal. We played in good style. We must keep this feeling and mentality.

'This is the aggression we want. It was important to get this victory. For me, it’s not only three points - it’s a little bit more.'

Sportsmail's Graham Poll gives his verdict on the refereeing talking points at White Hart Lane

'Michael Oliver had two big penalty calls in the closing minutes. 

'The first, with current interpretation should have been a spot kick for Everton as Federico Fazio handled, the ball hitting his arm with the defender in an unnatural position.

Everton had a right to feel aggrieved that they weren't awarded a penalty, with Fazio clearly handling

'Minutes later Harry Kane was through and went down under a challenge from Muhamed Besic. 

'Watching replays I could not tell whose leg had tripped whose so waving appeals away was the only sensible option for Oliver.'
