North Korea is risking potential 'man-made catastrophe' by turning on an ageing nuclear reactor capable of producing plutonium for weapons and bombs, Russian sources have warned.

A U.S research institute has captured images of steam apparently rising from the five megawatt reactor at the Yongbyon complex which was closed in 2007.

But a senior Russian diplomat has claimed that the outdated reactor is in a 'nightmarish state' and that the nation could face a potential nuclear disaster if it has been made operational again.

Full steam ahead? This satellite image of the five megawatt (electric) reactor at the Yongbyon facility was taken on August 31. Steam is seen coming from the electrical power generation building

The source told the Interfax News Agency: 'Our main concern is linked to a very likely man-made disaster as a consequence. 'The reactor is in a nightmarish state, it is a design dating back to the 1950s.'For the Korean peninsula this could entail terrible consequences, if not a man-made catastrophe.'

The reactor, which was completed in 1986, was decommissioned as part of a disarmament agreement six years ago.

But North Korea vowed to restart the
facility, around 50 miles north of Pyongyang, in April amid a series of
threats towards the U.S. and South Korea over its latest nuclear and 
rocket tests.

Now, satellite imagery from August 31 has
captured steam rising from the nuclear facility - suggesting the 
reactor has restarted, according to the U.S.-Korea Institute at John 
Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.

The U.S envoy on North Korea said that the reported restart of the reactor would be a 'serious misstep on the part of North Korea.'

He added that such an action would breach the United Nations Security Council resolutions.

The reactor produces 6kgs of plutonium a year, which could be used by North Korea to make nuclear weapons.

'The white coloration and volume are 
consistent with steam being vented because the electrical generating 
system is about to come online, indicating that the reactor is in or 
nearing operation,' said a report published on the Washington-based institute's website, 38 North, yesterday.

North Korea has conducted three nuclear tests since 2006 - however, the Yongbyon reactor, that yields weapons and bomb-grade plutonium, has been technically out of operation for years.

In 2008, the North destroyed its cooling tower as a 
confidence-building step in the six-nation talks.

However, in April, North Korea announced that it 
would revive the aged reactor, but stressed it was seeking a deterrent capacity.

At the time, nuclear
experts said it would probably take about half a year to 
get the reactor up and running if it had not suffered significant damage
from neglect.

However, the report, written by Jeffrey Lewis and Nick Hansen, suggests that the reactor has been started already and may, in fact, be nearing completion.

'Acknowledging that we are not completely
certain yet, this is very disappointing but not at all unexpected,' said James Acton, an 
analyst for the Nuclear Policy Program at the Carnegie Endowment for 
International Peace, a Washington-based think tank.

'It's not
unexpected because we've been able to see for months through satellite 
imagery that North Korea has been working on repairing the five-megawatt
electric reactor.

'Restarting it is 
another slap in the face to the international community, indicating that
North Korea has no intention whatsoever of abandoning its nuclear 
weapons.'

The U.N. nuclear watchdog has said today that it is aware of the report, but it does not yet have a 'clear understanding' of the situation.

This week, the U.S. ambassador to the IAEA, Joseph Macmanus, said the IAEA board of governors had 'reiterated overwhelmingly' that North Korea must cease all nuclear activities immediately and refrain from taking any steps to restart its nuclear facilities at Yongbyon.

North Korea said in July it would not give up 
its nuclear deterrent until Washington ends its 'hostile policy' towards
Pyongyang, although it was ready to revive nuclear talks.

The 
country tested a nuclear weapon in February and spent the first three 
months of 2013 issuing bellicose threats, including a warning that it 
would launch a nuclear attack against the United States and South Korea.

Recently,
however, Pyongyang has been on what analysts describe as one of its 
'periodic charm offensives' - agreeing with Seoul on Wednesday to re-open a
shuttered industrial park on a trial basis.

The Kaesong industrial zone, which
lies inside North Korea, was closed when Pyongyang pulled its 53,000
workers out in April amid rising tensions.

But now, North and South Korea have agreed to restart operations at the joint industrial park, which will be opened on a trial basis next week.

South 
Korea's National Intelligence Service has said it can not confirm the suspected restarting of Yongbyon's nuclear reactor
because it involves confidential intelligence.
