Ten Queensland police officers arrested a man wearing an 'I'm With Stupid' T-shirt in Brisbane this morning.

Police alleged the 44-year-old man, who has been named as Iain Fogerty, was being a 'public nuisance' and was 'being disruptive to people' in Fortitude Valley, around 8:30am.

Labor campaigners said he was simply smiling and waving while standing next to Liberal Party campaigners and posing for photographs.

'We thought it was really funny,' a Labor source told Daily Mail Australia. 'Next thing, all these cops arrived.

Off you go, mate: Ten police officers swooped and arrested this 44-year-old man this morning

Labor campaigners said the man was standing among Liberal National Party campaigners, smiling and waving when he was arrested

However, Liberal campaigners said he was acting aggressively prior to the arrest. Above, the man is being bundled into the back of a van

'We asked the police what happened and the police said he was being arrested for public nuisance, which was really strange.' 

'We've been really concerned about him ever since'. 

Luke Barnes, a Liberal National Party worker, told the Brisbane Times the man had been acting aggressively.

'One of their supporters came over to our side and got quite aggressive and intimidating with our members,' he was quoted saying.  

Thousands of police officers recently took to the streets of Brisbane as part of a major security operation for the G20 Leader's Summit

Mr Fogerty was expected to receive 'watchhouse bail' this afternoon and face court on February 4.

Speaking of the arrest, a Queensland police spokesman insisted: 'It didn't have anything to do with the shirt.' 

But social media erupted in mockery over the arrest, with many punters taking aim at the apparently draconian measure and #ImWithStupid trending nationwide.

'Man arrested at a campaign event in Qld, wearing 'I'm With Stupid' t-shirt... thus getting the campaign officially underway,' quipped Tim Callanan.

The state election will be held on January 31.
