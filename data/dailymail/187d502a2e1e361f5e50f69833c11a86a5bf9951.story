LeBron James can only hope he gets a reception like this in Cleveland.

The NBA star proved he's one of the biggest sports names in the world today when he met thousands of screaming fans in Beijing, China.

It was part of a Nike promotion to help sell shoes and promote the game of basketball in the world's most populous nation.

In the mania to catch a glimpse of the two-time NBA champion, one fan even broke loose from the barriers and hugged James.

The superstar's security grabbed the young man and hauled him away.

Thousands of young fans shouted 'LBJ! LBJ!' as he arrived at a court on Monday.

'Every time I come here, the game of basketball grows more and more every time. From the locals that's here to play the game all the way to us NBA players that's here to continue to inspire these kids,' he told the crowd.

'It's been great, man. All the way from before I came - to 2008 and the Beijing Olympics, all the way up to now and the game continues to rise and I think that's amazing.'

James said he is proud to see how basketball has grown in popularity in China every time he visits the country

Earlier this month James announced in a surprise move that he was turning to his hometown Cleveland Cavaliers after spending four years with the Miami Heat.

He famously 'took his talents to South Beach' after making an announcement that he was leaving the Cavs in 2010.

LeBron grew up in nearby Akron, Ohio, and still maintains strong ties to the community.

His status as the biggest star in the NBA has made him an international celebrity, as well as one of the most famous athletes in America.

As James hinted, basketball has been on the rise in China for many years.

The rise of 7-foot-6 Chinese superstar Yao Ming helped popularity for the sport skyrocket.

Today, it is arguably the most popular sport in the nation of 1.35billion.
