A former Grand Slam tennis champion  has denied sexually abusing three girls he coaches decades ago, a court heard.

Bob Hewitt, 75, claimed that the mother of one of his alleged victims supported him as he gave evidence at his trial in Johannesburg, South Africa.

Hewitt, one of the world's best doubles plays in the 1960s and 1970s, testified for the first time today.   

He said the mother of one of his accusers 'has supported me that I did not do anything to her daughter.'

Hewitt, who was a member of the U.S.-based International Tennis Hall of Fame before the allegations of abuse emerged, is on trial charged with two counts of rape and one of sexual assault of girls he coached in cases dating back more than 30 years.

The alleged offenses all took place in South Africa, where he now lives.

Two women testified  that Hewitt raped them in the early 1980s when they were both under 16.

A third accused him of sexually assaulting her during a tennis lesson in the early 1990s, when she was between 14 and 17 years. 

Australian-born Hewitt, who  accompanied at court by his wife, won nine Grand Slam doubles and six mixed doubles titles in the 1960s and 1970s.

He also reached the semifinals of the men's singles at the Australian Open three times and won the Davis Cup with South Africa in 1974 after settling there.

He teamed up occasionally with greats Billie Jean King and Arthur Ashe.

He was indefinitely suspended from the Rhode Island-based Hall of Fame in 2012 after the organisation conducted an investigation into the allegations.
