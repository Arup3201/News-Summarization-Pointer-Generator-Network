Off at university: Brian Viner does not want to know what his daughter Elly, pictured, gets up to during term time, let alone under his own roof

His name was Tom. He was bright, attractive, confident and likeable. Yet even if he had been an armed robber high on drugs, I could not have found his presence under my roof more unsettling.

He was my teenage daughter’s first proper boyfriend, or at least the first that she had brought home. She had met him at a rugby tournament. He lived miles away. And he was staying the night.

What does a father do? All I know is what I did. I greeted him warmly, and made a rather flamboyant point of picking up his overnight bag and inviting him to climb the stairs with me. My daughter Elly, just 17, watched us go, partly amused, but mostly horrified.

I showed Tom, also 17, into the spare room. ‘This is where you’ll be sleeping, Tom,’ I said, holding his gaze for a few seconds longer than was comfortable for either of us.

I didn’t want to deal with him like Harry Connick Jnr’s character in the film New In Town, who waves his daughter off to her first dance with a menacing warning for her escort: ‘Just remember, anything you do to her, I do to you.’ But I felt I had a firm message for him, all the same.

Later, while Tom was playing cricket in the garden with my two sons — now that was more like it — Elly, my wife Jane and I held an emergency tripartite summit in the kitchen.

Elly was indignant almost to the point of tears that I had consigned Tom to the spare room. I said that I would not countenance the idea of any other arrangement. Jane, the dove to my hawk, told her that she and Tom should do what teenagers have been doing for generations — and at least pretend to abide by the house rules.

In other words, if he was going to pad across the landing in the dead of night, they should make sure that a) nobody heard, and b) he woke up where he was supposed to.

That was my cue to be indignant. In my house? It was unspeakable.

Later though, I realised, with a heavy heart, that my wife was right. If my daughter wanted to have sex, there was little I could do to stop her. I could erect as many barriers as I liked — and trust me, I would have put up barbed wire if I could — but she would have found a way around it.

To this day, I’m not sure if she and Tom ever did the deed under my roof, but I like to cling to the faint hope that my stern look put them off.

I’m not the only man to feel like this. Indeed, mothers are better at these things. For fathers, the thought of their teenage daughters having sex triggers the most visceral, primal feelings.

After all, from prehistoric times the principle role of a father has been to offer protection, and there are endless examples in popular culture of fathers eyeing with deep suspicion, if not outright hostility, young men with designs on their daughters.

Nothing is more likely to turn even a mild-mannered man homicidal than a threat to the physical or emotional well-being of his children, and rightly or wrongly, that threat includes sex.

When meeting the heartthrobs from a boy band called the Jonas Brothers, even that supposed paragon of liberalism, President Obama, made a joke about wiping them from the face of the earth because his daughters were so enamoured with them.

‘Sasha and Malia are huge fans, but boys, don’t get any ideas,’ he said. ‘Two words for you. Predator drones. You will never see them coming.’

In my home, in the absence of predator drones, a cricket bat might have done the job. But I didn’t want to kill Tom for transgressing the house rules, not least because I had no real proof that he did so.

I’d shown him to the spare room, given him what I thought was a hard, meaningful look, then proceeded to bury my head in the sand and hope for the best.

In fact, behaving like an ostrich is the closest I’ve ever come to the birds and the bees. I have never had a discussion with my daughter about sex, or with my sons, who are 17 and 14, come to that.

Whatever they’ve learnt, it hasn’t been from me. Anyway, isn’t that what TV shows like The Inbetweeners — which shows a riot of teenage hormones in every episode — are for? It’s not, of course. Indeed, perish the thought. But it is certainly true that sex education rarely comes from parents any more.

In my case, it never did. One of the most vivid memories I have of my own father, who died when I was 14, is of him changing the subject when, aged about 11, I asked him what a ‘Johnny bag’ (a phrase I’d heard at school) was.

It was the perfect opportunity for him to explain the rudiments of contraception. Instead, he rebuked me for uttering a ‘very rude’ word, then said: ‘Now, I wonder what’s for lunch?’

I always hoped that I would be more relaxed and open about sex with my own children, but I’m not. To an extent, I’ve been let off the hook by the new school curriculum, which covers all of this and more.

Even when they were at primary school, in rural Herefordshire, they were visited by a friendly nurse who talked frankly about sexual intercourse. The equivalent, when I was growing up in the early Seventies, was a film of a labrador having puppies. My attitude to my children having sex is clearly influenced by my own adolescence, which doubtless explains why I feel differently about my daughter losing her virginity, as opposed to my sons losing theirs.

Elly is beautiful, vivacious and popular, and from the time she was about 15 I’ve known that at least some of the boys in her social circle must have harboured the same lascivious thoughts about her that I had for girls at the same age.

Most of them I haven’t seen for 35 years, yet I can still name them all — Suzanne, Nicola, Mandy (oh God, Mandy) — and remember that I wanted more than anything to share a bed with them.

But if it’s my boys having those thoughts about the girls they know? Well, I want them to treat girls with respect, of course, but on the whole, good on them.

They don’t have girlfriends at the moment, but if they did, I wouldn’t have a problem with them staying over, and can’t imagine I’d lose sleep over what they were getting up to under my roof. Call this hypocrisy, or double-standards, if you like. To me, it’s just part of the strange condition, universal yet unique, of fatherhood.

And as I say, motherhood is different on this subject. At any rate, I’d consider it strange if a teenage girl confided more readily in her dad than her mum about sexual matters, which is no doubt why so many mothers are able to keep fathers blissfully in the dark about their daughter’s love lives. The protectors protected.

I’m sure that Jane has shielded me from the realities of Elly’s romances, by talking to her about contraception and consoling her when boys didn’t call.

Indeed, she only broke it to me a few months ago — with Elly now aged 19 and off at university — that our daughter is, indeed, sexually active. While, rationally, I’d suspected this must have been the case, a part of me was clinging onto the illusion that my little girl was still untouched by teenage boys’ sweaty paws.

In the case of a friend of mine, this extended to his wife telling him that their daughter Annie, in her mid-teens, was spending every Saturday night at her friend Lily’s house.

For more than a year, he assumed she and Lily had a really wonderful friendship. It wasn’t an outright lie.

But what his wife knew and he still doesn’t is that Annie was sleeping with Lily’s older brother. Annie is 24 now, and Lily’s brother is history, but that particular cat is still not out of the bag. Perhaps for us, what’s also worrying is that we live in the middle of nowhere, where the convention is that parties, even for young teenagers, turn into sleepovers.

When we moved from London to the countryside 11 years ago, we assured ourselves that we would be extending our children’s childhoods. In some ways, that proved to be the case. They carried on playing in the woods, climbing trees, making dens.

But whatever they are doing at parties, they aren’t singing Ging Gang Goolie round a camp fire. Sometimes it’s best for dads not to know. Even when, heaven forbid, it might be happening under your own roof.
