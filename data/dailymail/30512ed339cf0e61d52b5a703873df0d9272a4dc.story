Former figure-skater Johnny Weir charmed America as a commentator during the Sochi Olympics, but his estranged husband is now accusing him of sending a 'hateful' and 'disgusting' email in the latest row of their bitter divorce.

Soon to be ex-husband Victor Voronov filed court papers Monday, accusing Weir of violating a temporary restraining order by sending the email.

'On Friday, Johnny sent Victor a disgusting, hateful email which violated the no contact order as part of the temporary restraining order he got last week,' a source told Radar.

Voronov had the restraining order put in place after an incident on March 5 in which Weir allegedly hit him on the arm and threw a wooden Russian doll at him.

'So on Monday, Victor filed a police 
report with cops in Rutherford, New Jersey. There will be separate court
 proceedings on Wednesday in which the alleged violation will be dealt 
with. Johnny could be in very serious legal trouble if the judge finds 
him in contempt for violating terms of the temporary restraining order,'
 the source added.

The allegations of a broken restraining order are just the most recent developments in Weir and Voronov's fued.

Angry
 Voronov, 29, claims that Weir committed multiple acts of adultery - 
including an affair with an unidentified Chicago club owner and sexting a
 porn star. He also says Weir is holding their dog Tema 
hostage.  

In legal 
documents obtained by TMZ, Voronov also alleges that Weir forced him out
 of the closet during their relationship and that he married him because
 his life with a Georgetown-educated lawyer would make compelling 
reality television.

Claiming that his husband treated him like an errand boy, Voronov says that Weir was cruel to him and even forbid him from letting his dog, Tema, live with them in case it took his attention away from the ice-skater.

In addition to the allegations of adultery and cruelty, Voronov is also requesting a judge to force Weir to return property the lawyer claims the Olympian took from him.

These include 20 furs - including a $125,000 coat made from sable - a crocodile Celine bag, 40 Balenciaga bags, one green and one orange Hermes Birkin and 12 Chanel bags.

He is also claiming temporary support and legal fees.

Anger: The two have traded accusations about the other through the media - alleging adultery and physical abuse

A source close to Weir told TMZ that the property Voronov is requesting was the Winter Olympic commentators before their marriage, which the source added, 'couldn't be more obvious from the fact that they are purses and women's furs.'

The source also added that Weir 'categorically denies' the adultery allegations.

But  last week, in a sign of how acrimonious the split has becoming, Weir pened up about his divorce from his husband - claiming his husband was often abusive towards him and relied on his money.

In an ugly twist, the 29-year-old former skater shared details of his two-year marriage with Victor Voronov, a non-practicing attorney, in an interview with Access Hollywood on Thursday.

While he was all smiles and professionalism during his stint as a commentator in Sochi, behind the scenes, he struggling with a 'personal hell' of an emotionally and physically abusive partner, he said. He filed for divorce on February 12, while he was in Sochi.

And in a sign that this split may be about to get uglier still, Weir's ex released an image to TMZ of the bite mark he claimed the presenter inflicted on his arm.

'Sochi was one of the hardest times in my life,' he said. 'When I was on the broadcasting, I escaped my own personal hell that I was living in.

'My husband was behaving very erratically. The majority of the time off camera I was in tears. I was on the phone. I was fighting. I was not in a good place.'

He said that while the damage couldn't be seen on his body, he was controlled emotionally and Voronov forced him to cut out friends, professional contacts and even his mother.

He added that their fights involved wrestling - and that it sometimes got out of control, including the incident in which he bit Voronov, who called the police.

A picture of the alleged bite appeared on TMZ and shows a deep gash on a man's forearm.  Despite the fall out, however, the couple appeared together in a New Jersey court earlier this month and a judge agreed to dismiss the case.

Speaking to Access Hollywood, Weir said that physical attacks weren't just made by him.

'Some of my closest friends have seen him hit me before,' he said.

He added that he had added pressure because Voronov, whom he married after a short romance, had taken on the 'traditional' role and Weir was left to provide for the two of them.

'He was not super accepting of the fact that I work and I have to work this week in Russia, this week in Los Angeles, next week in Tokyo,' he said.

'I was supporting two people and whether it seems like a big deal or not, I come from a lower middle class family that has to work, no matter what.

'If you can’t be an attorney this week, then you better go get a job next week, otherwise the bills won’t get paid. I had to travel to work to support myself and to support my family.'

On Friday, TMZ also reported that Weir emailed Voronov last September, claiming that he had destroyed his pricey Birkin bag.

'If you decide to wreck things, please wreck cheaper things than Birkin,' he wrote. 'He goes on ..."The f*** you on the Birkin is kinda cool, though, you artist.'

Despite the rocky relationship, Voronov said on his Twitter account that he had not been aware that Weir had filed for divorce until the announcement this week.

Weir had written on Wednesday: 'It is with great sadness that I announce that my husband and I are no longer together. My heart hurts and I wish him well.'

'Shocked by the abrupt ending of my marriage and am dealing with the trauma including multiple things I am just now becoming aware of...' he wrote on Wednesday.

Champion on ice: Weir competed in the 2010 
Vancouver Winter Olympics, finishing sixth place in the men's single 
competition, and was a hit in his first commentary stint at Sochi

On Thursday he added: 'Yes. I'd like to confirm, It's true: I am only now finding out that my husband @johnnygweir filed for divorce from me months ago.'

Voronov's spokesperson, Wendy Feldman, added: 'It is our extreme hope and desire that this divorce could have been handled amicably. Not only is Victor heartbroken but he is now humiliated.'

But Weir said he's not worried about the scandal - and that his ex has nothing up his sleeve that could do any damage.

'The worst that he could do is post naked photos that we have between each other and I look flawless,' he said.

Weir officially came out as gay in his memoir Welcome to My World in 2011, citing a recent string of gay suicides as his reason to be open about his sexuality.

On New Year's Eve that year, he married Voronov, a Georgetown Law graduate.

Ahead of the nuptials, Weir told IceNetwork that Voronov, who comes from a Russian family but grew up in Atlanta, was 'kind of everything that I've ever looked for and aspired to be in a relationship with'.

He went on: 'We've known for a long time and we reconnected over the summer, and it's just been a whirlwind. He's wonderful. He's in the legal field, completely separate from all of my razzle dazzle. He loves watching me perform and seeing what I actually do.'

But in February, he told Access Hollywood that the relationship could be fiery.

'A marriage between two guys is different than what I imagine a marriage between a man and a woman [to be],' he said. 'I mean, we're both constantly trying to fight to wear the pants in the relationship. It's constant fireworks. It's very boom, boom, boom.'
