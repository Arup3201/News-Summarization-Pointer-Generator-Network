A cereal fan has spent a staggering £36,800 tasting cornflakes in 60 countries - in search of the perfect bowlful.

Married Mick Hobday, 33, munched his way through a massive 4,000 bowls of cornflakes while on his travels across five continents.

He has made numerous trips around the world over ten years and tries to buy only local brand flakes.

But Mick’s quest for the perfect flake continues, with a trip to India scheduled for later this year.

He describes his ideal cornflake as 'dark, crunchy, organic and locally grown'.

However, some cheaper, paler brands - mostly found in Asia and Africa - have tasted 'more like cardboard, and gone limp’, once soaked in milk.

Mick’s passion for cornflakes started when he first ate them for breakfast aged ten.

He later began to gorge on them up to three times a day, sometimes even for lunch and dinner. He eats them with milk and sugar.

The keen traveller came up with the idea of combining his passion for travel and cornflakes while in Mexico, in September 2002.

He has since eaten them in dozens of countries, including Mali, Brazil, Thailand, and Switzerland.

The Eiffel Tower in Paris, Times Square in New York and the pyramids in Egypt have all featured as backdrops.

But Mick has now eaten so many of them while travelling he prefers to eat branflakes when back at his home in Fareham, Hampshire.

He has worked in a variety of temporary jobs to save money for his travels, of which over 13,000 miles have been covered on a bicycle.

He said: 'I live to travel and want to visit every country in the world.'

He added: 'However, I wanted to make my journey unique, so I came up with the idea of eating cornflakes in each country

'I’ve eaten them for breakfast from a young age, but I later began to eat them more and more - sometimes as a quick and easy lunch and dinner.

'I thought my idea was the perfect way to combine my two passions.

'Thankfully, it has not been too difficult finding cornflakes in shops around the world as they are a basic cereal.

'The most I have had to travel to buy a packet is from a rural village to the nearest town or city.

'I do try to buy a local brand whenever I can to support the area and to try something new.

'However, the quality has varied, and I am still on the hunt for my perfect flake.'

1. Egypt - Crunchy flakes whilst sitting on the Giza plateau.

2. Turkey - Great flakes, tasted sweet.

3. Bosnia - At the Bosnian Pyramid of the Sun in Visoko.

4. UK - With the flakes I grew up loving outside Stonehenge.

5. Germany - nice crunchy, dark tasty flakes before England v Sweden in World Cup 2006.

1. Mauritania - The camel milk was awful.

2. Bulgaria - They were really cheap and like plastic.

3. Indonesia - Cheap flakes and the milk was warm.

4. Albania - Eating them next to a motorway, I could taste smoke.

5. Singapore - The flakes tasted awful after the extortionate price I had to pay.

He added: 'My ideal would be dark, crunchy, organic, locally grown, and handmade.

'However, some have been very disappointing.

'The cheaper ones have been pumped with air, looked pale, and taste more like paper or cardboard.

'They also go limp in milk. There is quite a clear divide between quality of cornflakes in the developed and developing world.

'I had to use varying amount of sugar to try and give some of the poorer flakes some flavour.

'That also gave me some of the energy I needed to cycle throughout the day.'

'The quality of the milk and the surroundings can also influence how much I enjoy my bowlful.

'It is nice to have a picturesque setting, such as the spectacular Sahara dessert, and ice cold milk.

'I’d ideally eat them from a nice clean bowl and shiny spoon, because many of my bowlfuls have been from a Tupperware dish that I carry on my bicycle.”

Mick suffers from diabetes and has recently started to take more care of his diet.

That includes cutting down on cornflakes, and replacing them with branflakes or fruit and fibre while not travelling.

He added: 'I’ve eaten so many cornflakes over the years, I have started to go off them and now eat different cereal at home.

'However, I’m still on the search for my ideal flake.'
