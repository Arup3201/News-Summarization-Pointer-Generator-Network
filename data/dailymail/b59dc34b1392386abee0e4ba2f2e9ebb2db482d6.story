A father-of-two with a rare cancer gene had his stomach removed despite being given the all-clear by doctors - and found he was in the early stages of the disease.

Dan Taylor, 33, decided to have the procedure to make sure he would live to see his young daughters grow up.

Doctors found he had the mutant E-cadherin gene which meant he had an 80 per chance of developing the aggressive stomach cancer that claimed the lives of two of his cousins.

Dan Taylor (pictured with his wife, Anne) has a rare gene which meant he had an 80 per cent chance of developing stomach cancer. He had his stomach removed to ensure he would live to see his daughters grow up

They told Mr Taylor he had not yet developed the disease but he still underwent the major six-hour operation to remove his stomach.

Medics then discovered he had been in the early stages of the disease after all and that the procedure had saved his life.

Mr Taylor, of York, who inherited the gene from his father’s side of the family, said: ‘I have two adorable children and want to see them grow up.

‘The survival rates of stomach cancer are absolutely dire so it wasn’t a difficult decision to make.

‘To go ahead with an operation of that magnitude is a personal choice. One of the great things is the risk has gone and is never coming back.

‘I’m so glad I did it because I did have the early stages of stomach cancer.

Mr Taylor (pictured with his wife, Anne, and daughters Abigail, five, and Edith, two) had tests which suggested that he did not have the cancer but he decided to have his stomach removed anyway

‘I’d had an endoscopy and biopsies at the end of 2011 which came back clear for stomach cancer, but the risk was still there.

‘We were told endoscopies can be unreliable and biopsies can miss cancer by millimetres so I decided to take the drastic decision to have my stomach removed.

‘People say I’m really unlucky to have that gene but I feel incredibly fortunate I found out about it and had this treatment before I had to go through something much worse.

After the operation, Mr Taylor discovered that he did actually have early stage stomach cancer so the surgery saved his life. He says he is relieved that the risk is gone

‘Rather than a negative thing, I think it’s quite a positive.’

Mr Taylor and his wife Anne, who run a web design company, now face an anxious wait to see if their daughters Abigail, five, and Edith, two, have also inherited the cancer gene.

The youngsters will have to wait until their early teens until they can be tested for the gene which they have a 50 per cent chance of carrying.

Mr Taylor said: ‘We have the stress that one day our kids may go through something like this but that’s a long way off.

Mr Taylor cannot store food now that he does not have a stomach so he has to eat a high-calorie diet and has lots of small meals every day

‘The way medicine is progressing it could be something which is resolved without an operation.’

Mr Taylor made a speedy recovery after the operation and less than two weeks later was enjoying a couple of pints in his local. After six weeks he was back at work.

The operation was possible as the stomach is mainly used for food storage and is not essential for digestion.

As part of the procedure the bottom of Mr Taylor’s oesophagus was connected to the top of his intestines.

Mr Taylor, who runs a web design company with his wife, says that he was amazed by how quickly he recovered after the operation

This has reduced his capacity for food and means he needs to eat little and often, with lots of high calorie meals.

He said: ‘It’s not a different as you might think. I enjoy a diet most people would be jealous of and have a lot of biscuits and crisps at my desk.

‘I am always pretty optimistic but by my standards the recovery was quicker and easier than I thought and I feel better than I ever thought I would again.’

The E-cadherin gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps cells stick to one another.

The proteins bind cells together so that they form organised tissues.

The gene is also thought to act as a tumour suppressor, preventing cells from growing and dividing in an uncontrolled way to form a cancerous tumour.

Because this protein helps cells stick together, it may stop cancer cells detaching from a tumour and travelling through the bloodstream to other parts of the body.

More than 50 mutations of the gene have been found in people with an inherited cancer syndrome called hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.

This disorder greatly increases the risk of a person developing cancer of the stomach lining.

In these people, the cancer most commonly develops when they are in their 30s or 40s.
