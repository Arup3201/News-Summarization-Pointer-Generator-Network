Daniel Sturridge has pulled out of the England squad as his injury curse struck yet again and problems threatened to mount for manager Roy Hodgson.

Sturridge reported for duty at St George's Park on Monday but did not train and had a scan in the evening which revealed a thigh problem which he sustained against Manchester United on Sunday.

The 25-year-old striker returned home on Monday night, the second Liverpool player to withdraw from international duty on the day, Adam Lallana was also forced out with a groin injury and was replaced by uncapped Tottenham midfielder Ryan Mason.

They will miss a Euro 2016 qualifier against Lithuania at Wembley on Friday and a friendly against Italy in Turin on Tuesday.

A FA statement said: 'Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge has left the England squad and returned home to his club on Monday evening.

'This follows a scan on an injury that he sustained during Liverpool's game against Manchester United on Sunday.

'The England medical team took the decision on Monday evening having assessed Daniel following the squad's arrival at St. George's Park on Monday afternoon.'

For Sturridge it is the latest in a sequence of fitness issues this season.

He was Hodgson's first-choice centre-forward at the World Cup last summer but missed five months of this season after pulling a thigh muscle during an England training session in September.

There was a blaze of controversy about whether he should have been resting or training on that particular day, followed by complications in his recovery process, none of which helped the relationship between club and country.

Sturridge then suffered with calf muscle injuries and was just getting back to his sharpest form when he hobbled out of Anfield with a stiff hip after scoring Liverpool's goal in a 2-1 defeat against Manchester United.

He will have missed seven England games since his last international appearance against Norway in September. 

Sturridge has not played for England since the autumn because of injury 

Harry Kane could be in line to make his debut for England against Lithuania 

August 2012 - Toe injury

February 2013- Thigh injury

September 2013 - Thigh injury

September 2014 - Thigh injury

October 2014 - Thigh injury

Sturridge and Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, however, will be wary of taking risks after a campaign already ruined by injuries and with the Anfield club locked in a fight for a top-four finish.

Wayne Rooney and Danny Welbeck are available for Hodgson but Sturridge's exit boost Kane's chances of making his senior debut against Lithuania on Friday. There may also be the chance of a call-up for QPR's Charlie Austin, or promotion from the Under 21s for Burnley's Danny Ings.

Kane, 21, is in the midst of a remarkable season and took his goal tally to 29 with a hat-trick against Leicester on Saturday, but a club-v-country issue is brewing around him because England want him for the European U21 Championships, in June, while Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino thinks he needs a month of complete rest at the end of the season.

England are set to train at Tottenham on Thursday and Pochettino plans to be on site.

Raheem Sterling arrived at St George's Park nursing a toe injury which may limit his involvement over the two England games – he is one of the players who may be released after the Lithuania qualifier.

Fabian Delph was also missing from the camp on Monday. Aston Villa midfielder Delph was ill and stayed at home but hopes to join the squad later this week.

Luke Shaw and Fraser Forster were in Hodgson's original squad but pulled out with injuries, prompting call-ups for Danny Rose and Robert Green.

Another important Liverpool player, goalkeeper Simon Mignolet, is doubtful for Belgium after picking an ankle injury in a collision with Rooney on Sunday.
