Manchester City are plotting a big-money move for Juventus midfielder Paul Pogba.

Work has already begun on identifying Yaya Toure's long-term successor - and France star Pogba features highly among the candidates.

The former Manchester United youngster is already viewed as one of the best all-round midfielders in Europe, despite being only 21.

Pogba came through the ranks at Manchester United but ended up leaving Old Trafford two years ago

In terms of fee paid: 

Sergio Aguero £38m from Atletico Madrid (2011)

Robinho £32.5m from Real Madrid (2008)

Eliaquim Mangala £32m from Porto (2014)

Fernandinho £30m from Shakhtar Donetsk (2013)

Edin Dzeko £27m from Wolfsburg (2011)

Pogba signed a new long term deal to stay in Turin earlier this year.

But that will not put City off should they decide he is the man they want to marshal their midfield in the long-term.

Juventus will demand a high price for Pogba, at least £40million, which would see City break their transfer record should the deal go through. It is currently £38m for Sergio Aguero from Atletico Madrid in 2011.

The Barclays Premier League champions are confident they are now in control of UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations, allowing them to make such a big-money swoop.

Arsenal are also long-term admirers of Pogba, manager Arsene Wenger would jump at the chance to sign his compatriot.

However, despite the Gunners' newly stabilised financial muscle, the numbers involved in such a deal could be beyond them.
