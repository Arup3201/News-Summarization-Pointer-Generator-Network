A man claims his neighbours' cat saved his life with its odd behaviour which he thinks warned him he was about to have a heart attack.

Pete White was at home in Heaton Norris, Stockport, when the cat, Chequers, started meowing outside to be let in. Once inside the cat is said to have started behaving out of character.

He said: 'She was howling at me and rubbing against my legs, which is very unusual. She wouldn’t leave me alone, she followed me all over the house howling away at me.'

 Stockport, Chequers, (pictured) started meowing outside to be let

When he started experiencing chest pains he at first put it down to indigestion, but then wondered if Chequers' strange behaviour could mean there was something more serious occurring.

'I suddenly thought "no, this is more",' he said. 'I picked up the phone and called an ambulance, I told them I thought I was having a heart attack.'

When the ambulance arrived a few minutes later, Mr White went into cardiac arrest.

He said: 'My wife told me they were in the house for nearly an hour stabilising me, but to me it seemed like seconds. I was completely out of it.'

He was rushed to the Manchester Royal 
Infirmary on Thursday, January 2, where he underwent an operation on his
 heart, before being transferred to the Coronary Care Unit in Stepping 
Hill.

 he at first put it down to indigestion, but then wondered if Chequers' 
strange behaviour could mean a heart attack - so he phoned 999

He is now back at home, and it is expected that he will take around four to six weeks to recover.

Mr White, who lives with his wife Jennifer, says he will always be grateful to their ‘furry little neighbour hero’, as if he had left it another five minutes before calling an ambulance he could have died.

'In the Coronary Care Unit at Stepping Hill I was speaking to the vicar and told him what had happened,' he said.

'He was impressed with the cat’s actions and said it was usually dogs who acted like that on rare occasions.'

Chequers’ owner, Peter Belshaw, confirmed that the behaviour Mr White described was very out of character for her.

'As a general rule she is quite a private cat,' he said.
