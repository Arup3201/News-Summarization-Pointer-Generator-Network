It is one of the country’s newest, and most sentimental, Christmas traditions: a festive offering guaranteed to reduce even the most hardened Scrooge into a sniffling, tear-sodden wreck.

It is no surprise, then, when Lucie Edwards starts to dab her eyes. Because she is the mother of the boy starring in this year’s John Lewis Christmas TV commercial and she is sitting down to watch it for the first time.

It prompts Lucie Edwards to hug her eight-year-old son Rhys, who was chosen from hundreds of hopefuls to star in the £1 million advert.

Rhys Edwards, the eight-year-old boy who stars in the news John Lewis ad sits down with his mother Lucie Edwards to watch the commercial 

He beams with pride, but is dry-eyed – and must be one of the few people in Britain to remain unmoved by the 60-second film.

For those who haven’t seen it yet, this year’s John Lewis advert tells the heart-warming story of Sam and his penguin pal, Monty. The inseparable pair are seen playing Lego and romping in the park, but it soon becomes clear that Monty is lonely for love.

Fast-forward to Christmas Day and Sam surprises Monty with his gift of a mate, Mabel. The pair rub beaks, singer Tom Odell’s melancholy cover of the John Lennon song Real Love soars – and the nation reaches for the hankies.

‘Are you crying, Mum?’ Rhys asks, noticing his mother’s tearstained face. ‘You are, you’re crying! Oh, Mum!’ he teases.

‘All right, all right,’ replies Lucie, regaining her composure. ‘I’m just so proud of you.’

Devotees of Christmas commercial breaks might be forgiven for thinking that Rhys looks more than a little familiar. Despite his tender age, he is, we can reveal, quite the ghost of television Christmas past.

Last year, he played the adorable boy in the DFS Christmas advert. The year before, he was cast in the McDonald’s Christmas spot – and made an appearance in the Christmas special of Call The Midwife.

The John Lewis ad is arguably his biggest role, and one he’s keen to repeat. ‘I’m the king of Christmas adverts!’ he declares. ‘I’d really like to be in the John Lewis Christmas advert every year from now on. I do miss everyone from John Lewis.’

Lucie, 34, says: ‘He is like the Christmas child. I think it’s all down to that cheeky face and grin. The directors of the John Lewis advert told me one of things they liked about Rhys was the dimple he gets when he smiles. It’s actually a scar from when he fell out of his bunk bed when he was aged five.

‘His dad and I are always telling him to look after his face, then he falls out of bed.’

Rhys started acting at five after being taken on by child talent agency Daisy & Dukes. ‘One of the ladies who worked at Rhys’s nursery had children at the same agency,’ explains Lucie, who owns a domestic cleaning franchise and lives in Stevenage, Hertfordshire. ‘She kept saying Rhys would be brilliant at acting because he’s got a great face and a lovely personality. I thought it would be nice for him to build his confidence and if he enjoyed it, that would be all well and good. As a little one he was quite sociable and I wanted him to build on that.’

Rhys sometimes does up to two castings a week in London, meaning he has to leave school early. When filming, he has to take time off, although the John Lewis ad was filmed long before Christmas – in the summer holidays.

‘It’s not like the kids are being taken out just to go on holiday. It’s learning of a different kind. Rhys is not sitting on a beach or at home doing nothing,’ Lucie says.

Before he auditioned for his latest role, Rhys, who has a younger brother and sister, had taken a break from acting to move house and schools. ‘I was a bit nervous,’ Rhys says. ‘Mum said I would get £2,500 so I was excited too.

‘But then she said, “Don’t get your hopes up too much, there are millions of people going for it.” Then a letter came through saying I’d got it so I was happy.’

John Lewis has given Rhys an enormous Monty toy and smaller Monty and Mabel figures – which have already sold out on the retailer’s website. John Lewis says more will be available next week.

So will Rhys spend some of his fee on a penguin onesie (£20) or a pair of penguin cufflinks (£20), perhaps? He says thoughtfully: ‘Mum says I can’t really spend any money in my bank because I need to save up for a car. There is a remote-control dinosaur which costs £100 that I’d like, though,’ he adds, giving his mother a pleading look.

‘What my dad wants – and I want too – is a drone. They’re £369, which isn’t that expensive.’

‘That is quite expensive, Rhys,’ Lucie reminds him. ‘He’s become aware of how much money he has in his bank account from his acting work and asks to buy this, that and the other,’ she explains.

‘But I’ve told him a car could cost up to £10,000. The concept of how much things cost hasn’t really sunk in. I’m keen to keep his feet on the ground and teach him the value of money.’

The advert has already been watched by millions on television and 4.5 million viewers on YouTube. Lucie says Rhys was treated like a star during filming and had his own Winnebago mobile home for part of the shoot. At times, she admits, this treatment went to his head.

‘He had the Winnebago to himself in the morning,’ Lucie recalls. ‘But by the afternoon there were a few other people using it.

‘I remember Rhys saying in quite a loud voice, “Mummy, there are some people in MY trailer,” which was a bit embarrassing.’

He could also request whatever he wanted for lunch, provided it was healthy. ‘The catering van didn’t really have things for children so the poor runners were sent out all over South London to get Rhys a jacket potato or chicken nuggets,’ Lucie laughs. Sugar was banned during the day but Rhys was allowed ice cream at the end of filming.

Now ‘the king of Christmas adverts’ has his eye on more substantial roles. His agent has put him forward for a part in the fifth Pirates Of The Caribbean movie – and Tinseltown could then beckon.

‘If he wanted to become a Hollywood actor that would be lovely,’ Lucie says.

‘The minute he says he doesn’t enjoy it, then that’ll be it. It’s completely his decision.’
