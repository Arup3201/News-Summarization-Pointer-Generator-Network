Monica Lewinsky has revealed that she uses a pseudonym sometimes to protect her privacy, but refuses to change her name even though the Clinton sex scandal has made her 'unemployable.' 

The former White House intern told Porter magazine that her name remains infamous 16 years after it was revealed she had an affair with President Bill Clinton. 

However, she says, 'No one else in the investigation had to change their name. Why should I?'

According to the New York Post, she told Porter magazine she sometimes uses a fake name to protect herself.

Infamous: Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern who had an affair with President Bill Clinton, says she couldn't get a job because her name became infamous

'I use aliases at times to protect my privacy, but I’m not ashamed of who I am,' she said. 

Lewinsky, now 41, says she still faces challenges living with her name, which became known worldwide when she was just 22.

'For a long time I didn’t realize the implication of simple things, like looking for an apartment. Now when I fill out a form I have to think, "Will somebody go to the press with my private information?"'

Lewinsky says she was afraid she would be indicted, arrested and sent to prison at the height of the 1998 scandal. 

Instead, her name was plastered all over the news media and the intimate details of her dalliances with the president were widely available on the Internet.

She says that despite her credentials - including a master's degree from the London School of Economics - she could not get a job for more than decade after the affair went public.  

Lewinsky stayed under the radar for 15 years following the scandal that led to Clinton's impeachment and made her name synonymous with the White House sex scandal.

She has recently stepped back into the public light to take a stand against cyberbullying. 

As a result of her exposure, including on the Internet, she fell into depression and even considered suicide, she has revealed.

The new issue of Porter magazine will be online and on newsstands Friday.
