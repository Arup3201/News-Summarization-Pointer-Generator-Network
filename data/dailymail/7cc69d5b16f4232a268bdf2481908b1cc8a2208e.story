Microsoft has created an interactive billion pixel image of its Seattle base - and hidden a few surprises in there.

The firm work with more than 100 local artists and performers to hide them within the image.

It claims the new image is the most ambitious interactive image ever created.

The full panorama consists of 2,368 twenty-two-megapixel images.

This resulted in two 10-gigapixel half panoramas, recording the city in fantastic detail, but still somewhat lacking in people.

The team then returned to the same spot six times with a Canon digital SLR with lenses ranging from 400 mm to 600 mm to capture the artists and performers, before combining them into the final, 20 gigapixel (20,000 megapixels), super high-resolution 360-degree panorama image.

'The Seattle Gigapixel ArtZoom project pushes the boundaries of the technology to deliver an image that allows anyone to pan and zoom through the city of Seattle with an amazing level of detail,' Microsoft said.

'In a fun twist, visitors to the site can discover more than 100 artists and performers in public spaces and in private buildings, near important Seattle landmarks and on random street corners, acting alone or interacting with onlookers.

It said the key to the project was finding a location with a clear view of Seattle.

'We started looking at Seattle as our canvas,' said Michael Cohen, who spearheaded the project, and also did much of the location scouting and secured the condo building that was eventually used.

'We first sought out the perfect rooftop location from which to shoot such a panorama.

'We were lucky enough to find the Bay Vista condominium building, and thanks to the gracious owners, get access to amazing 360-degree views that include the Seattle Center, the Olympic Sculpture Park, and Seattle's stadiums, as well Mount Rainier, Puget Sound, and Lake Union.Â 

The 'Easter Eggs' to look out for in the image

Artists hidden in the project include this bizarre cardboard car 'driven' by Seattle artist Paul Kuniholm Pauper

James Mahoney decided to insert a spacecraft into the image to show what Seattle's future might look like

Local band Future Fridays decided to dress as cardboard robots for their appearance in the massive panoramic image

'We also discussed the project with John Boylan, who has deep roots in the Seattle art scene.

'He helped us attract great interest from the arts community to come out and help create this celebration of the arts in Seattle.

'John introduced us to Elise Ballard, who coordinated the efforts of everyone involved in producing the entire piece.

'And finally, videographer Kris Crews helped us assemble a team to shoot video footage of the artists and performers from the ground.'

The full panorama consists of 2,368 twenty-two-megapixel images.

The team stitched these images together using Microsoft Research's Image Composite Editor (ICE) software, which is available for free.

This resulted in two 10-gigapixel half panoramas, recording the city in fantastic detail, but still somewhat lacking in people.

'Over the next few weeks, we climbed to the roof six more times to capture individual artists, acrobats, and other performers at dozens of locations visible in the panorama,' said Cohen.

These photos were captured from precisely the same spots on the roof as the panorama shots, using a Canon digital SLR with lenses ranging from 400 mm to 600 mm.

The team began work on the project in October - and it was finally launched today.

'Beginning on a brilliant sunny day in October, we climbed up to the roof to capture our first panorama using a Canon digital SLR camera, a professional 400 mm lens, and a Gigapan robotic tripod head,' said Cohen.

'We captured two half panoramas from opposite corners of the roof because no single spot had a perfect view in all directions (this explains the seams you see).

'While we captured still shots of the performers from the roof, video crews filmed the events on the ground.'

At Microsoft Research, Celso Gomes digitally put the the individual shots of artists and performers into the final 20-gigapixel panorama.

Meanwhile, the video footage from the ground and other media was assembled to create short video vignettes.

Finally, Eric Stollnitz built a web site that provides the world access to the panorama and other media.

'The result is the Seattle Gigapixel ArtZoom,' says Microsoft.

'We hope you have as much fun exploring the imagery as we had creating it.'
