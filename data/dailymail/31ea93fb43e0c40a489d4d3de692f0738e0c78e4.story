David Cameron at the EU budget summit. It has been revealed that more than 3,300 eurocrats are paid more than the Prime Minister

AT least 3,000 Brussels bureaucrats earn more than David Cameron, it emerged yesterday.

Official figures show that at least 3,325 EU officials – 7 per cent of the total workforce – take home more than the Prime Minister’s salary of £142,000.

The totals do not include the 27 EU commissioners – politicians appointed from each of the member states – who earn up to £219,000 each, plus allowances.

And on top of the huge pay packets, Eurocrats benefit from a range of perks including educational allowances for  children and 18 days off a year for public holidays.

The Prime Minister criticised the startlingly generous pay and perks of EU staff at last week’s Brussels summit, convened to draw up a seven-year budget deal.

He said the EU’s administration budget of 56billion euros should be cut by 10billion, but EU bosses instead wanted to increase it to 63billion. He also called for a cut in employees’ generous pensions.

The meeting collapsed after the 27 member states failed to come to agreement.

The pay figures were obtained by a German MEP, Inge Graessle, who campaigns for Brussels spending cuts.

She said: ‘The whole of the EU is being prescribed hard medicine by the commission, but the EU institutions themselves will have none of it.’

Pawel Swidlicki, of the Open Europe think tank, said: ‘These figures show that there is ample scope for savings within the EU’s staffing expenditure.’

A Whitehall source said: ‘The Prime Minister’s point is that if any organisation is serious about getting a grip on spending, it looks at its own overheads first.’

A spokesman for the European Commission said: ‘The majority of us are highly qualified professionals such as lawyers or economists and most of us are also  expatriates, so of course the average  salary is high.’
