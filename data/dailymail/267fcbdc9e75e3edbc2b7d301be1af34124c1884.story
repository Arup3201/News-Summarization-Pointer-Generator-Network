Bangladeshi authorities have ordered the shut down of 18 clothes factories for safety reasons, as the death toll from the factory collapse last month passed 800.

Dozens of bodies recovered today from collapsed Rana Plaza near Dhaka, which housed five garment factories, were so decomposed they were being sent to a lab for DNA identification, police said.

The workers there made clothes for familiar High Street brands including Primark and Matalan in the UK, and Spanish label Mango.

The grim work goes on: Excavators clear debris 
as Bangladeshi rescue and army personnel continue recovery operations at
the site of the eight-storey building collapse in Savar on the 
outskirts of Dhaka earlier today. Dozens of bodies recovered today were so badly decomposed they have been sent for DNA identification, police said

Masked rescue workers retrieve a dead body from 
the rubble: The workers at the factories made clothes for familiar High 
Street brands including Primark and Matalan in the UK, and Spanish label
Mango. This afternoon police in Bangladesh said the bodies of 803 garment factory workers have been recovered so far

Following protests, authorities also began disbursing salaries and other benefits to survivors of the collapse and ordered the shut down of a string of factories over further safety concerns.

The latter move came days after Bangladesh agreed with the International Labor Organisation to give safety 'the highest consideration', despite fears Western bargain retailers might source goods elsewhere.

'Sixteen factories have been closed down in Dhaka and two in Chittagong,' said textile minister Abdul Latif Siddique, adding that more could be shut if they do not meet strict new safety measures.

He added: 'We have seen that those who claim to be the best compliant factories in Bangladesh have not fully abided by building regulations.'

Police said 803 bodies had been recovered from the wreckage of the eight-story Rana Plaza building by late afternoon. More were expected as salvage work continued two weeks after the April 24 collapse.

The owner of the building only had permission for a five storey structure and there is speculation that his exceeding that was the cause of the collapse.

Now for the task of living: Vogobati, a garment worker who survived the building collapse, comes to collect salaries given by the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association earlier today

There is no clear indication of how many bodies still remain trapped in the debris because the exact number of people inside the building at the time of the incident is unknown.

More than 2,500 people were pulled from the rubble alive in the days following the disaster.

The Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association earlier said 3,122 workers were employed at the five factories housed in the building, but it was not clear how many were there during the packed morning shift.

Mass burial: The bodies of 34 unidentified garment workers killed when the Rana Plaza building collapsed in Bangaladesh have been interred in a mass burial a week after the disaster

Tragedy: Several hundred people attended the mass burial in Dhaka today, which took place amid calls for the owner of the collapsed building, Mohammed Sohel Rana, to face the death penalty

Major General Chowdhury Hasan 
Suhrawardy, a top military official in the area, said the operation to 
recover bodies from the tangle of wreckage could continue for two to 
three more days.

His men had
to send 36 decomposing bodies to Dhaka Medical College Hospital to 
collect DNA samples because they were beyond identification, he said.

With
temperatures at the site exceeding 30C and rain pouring down almost 
constantly, authorities expect to send many more rotting corpses for DNA
identification in the coming days.

The
disaster is the worst ever in the garment sector, far surpassing fires 
last year that killed about 260 people in Pakistan and 112 in 
Bangladesh, as well as the 1911 garment disaster in New York's Triangle 
Shirtwaist factory that killed 146 workers.

A country in mourning: A crowd gathered in front of the row of graves at the traditional Muslim funeral today, following the horrific collapse that exposed the unsafe conditions plaguing Bangladesh's garment industry

Death toll: Dozens of unclaimed bodies were buried in Dhaka today in the wake of the horrific accident, which claimed the lives of more than 400 workers

Anger: The building collapse, in which at least 410 people died and 2,500 were injured, was the worst industrial disaster in the country's history

Sorrow: The European Union is considering trade action against Bangladesh, which has preferential access to EU markets for its garments, in order to pressure Dhaka to improve safety standards after the building collapse killed hundreds of factory workers

Consequences: Rescue workers fear the death toll could rise even further after the collapse, which reduced the building filled with workers to an estimated 600 tons of rubble

After
hundreds of garment workers protested for compensation yesterday, 
authorities started disbursing salaries and other benefits.

General
Suhrawardy said some 400 workers gathered last night to receive dues 
and benefits. Rafiqul Islam, a BGMEA official, said the disbursement 
would continue in phases.

Mr
Islam said they planned to meet with workers' representatives later 
today to discuss how to reach out to victims for proper disbursement of 
compensation and other financial aid.

The
workers, many of whom made little more than the national minimum wage 
of about $38 per month, are demanding at least four months' salary. They
had set yesterday as a deadline for the payment of wages and other 
benefits.

'Their blood will not be valueless': The owner of the building is expected to be charged with negligence, illegal construction and forcing workers to join work - which is punishable by a maximum of seven years in jail

Fury: The owner of the collapsed building, Mohammed Sohel Rana, was seen wearing a police-issue helmet and body armour as he was escorted from a hearing at the High Court in Bangladesh

Local government 
administrator Yousuf Harun has said no salary remained unpaid except for
the month of April and there was an agreement for the workers to 
receive an additional three months of pay.

The
BGMEA said Monday that it was preparing a complete list of workers 
employed in the Rana Plaza factories and the process would take a few 
more days.

Bangladesh earns nearly $20 billion a year from exports of garment products, mainly to the United States and Europe.

Officials
say the building's owner illegally added three floors and allowed the 
garment factories to install heavy machines and generators, even though 
the structure was not designed to support such equipment.

The owner and eight other people including the owners of the garment factories have been detained.
