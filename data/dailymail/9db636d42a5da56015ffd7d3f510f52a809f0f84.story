Shocked classmates of the alleged Charlie Hebdo getaway driver have leapt to his defence - claiming he was in school with them at the time of the deadly attack.

Mourad Hamyd was arrested on Wednesday night after handing himself in at a local police station, after rumours he was involved in the Charlie Hebdo massacre began to circulate on social media.

But friends of the 18-year-old suspected terrorist say there is no way he could have been involved, as he was sitting in class at the Lycee Monge when the attack took place.

The school is in Charleville-Mezières, around 130 miles from the scene of the murders in Paris. 

Twitter user Vicomte Crew (@babydroma) claims her classmate was in school on Wednesday, using the hashtag #MouradHamydInnocent

Classmates immediately took to Twitter saying a terrible mistake had been made, using the hashtag #MouradHamydInnocent.

A user under the hand @babydroma insisted that Mourad was in her philosophy class, and added: ‘Please, he was in [school] all morning, he’s in my class.’ 

Another Twitter user - @AnyceDz, who is thought to have launched the hashtag - appeared on television to defend his classmate.

He is reported to have said he got the bus in with Hamyd at 8am, and spent the 10am break with him, then took the bus with him just before midday. 

 A Facebook group has also been set up in support of Hamyd – called ‘Hamyd Mourad est innocent’ – has more than 500 members who believe the teen is in no way connected to the massacre. 

But the school has not confirmed whether or not Hamyd was in class that day.

Headteacher  Miguel Rubio declined to comment and told MailOnline: ‘I’m sorry, but I can’t tell you any more because there is an inquiry and so we must wait until the inquiry is closed to speak.’

Hamyd, who is still in custody, is believed to be the brother-in-law of one of the suspected terrorists currently on the run from police.

According to public records, Hamyd’s sister Izzana - understood to be a nursery school teacher - is married to suspect Cherif Kouachi.

Cherif, 32, and his brother Said, 34, are both the subject of a massive manhunt, after allegedly storming the offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and killing 12 people. 

He and his family live on the 13th floor of an apartment block on the outskirts of Charleville-Mezieres, in a neighbourhood known for drug trafficking and vandalism.

When MailOnline contacted the family to ask for comment on Hamyd, an angry woman shouted in response: ‘No, no we are not doing interviews.’ 

@AnyceDz tweeted Hamyd was 'the last person on earth who would support terrorism'

However, neighbours in the Ronde Couture estate insisted they were a quiet family who were always friendly.

One said: ‘They are a nice family, never a problem. Mourad is a nice boy, he was always polite and very friendly.’ 

Neighbours who spoke to local newspaper L'Ardennais, described Mourad as a young man 'without history'.

They added he was a quiet teenager who was a 'moderate, who had never been about extremists'.

Other pupils at the Lycée Monge said he 'would not hurt a fly' and added that the allegations he was involved in the massacre had ruined his name forever.

And Hamyd's friends say he was ‘a good guy’ and that there was ‘no way’ he was a radicalised Islamist.

He is said to have been a popular and well-liked pupil at the school. 

A male teenager told MailOnline: ‘Mourad was a good guy, a nice kid.

‘We can’t believe what has happened. I think it is crazy to say he was involved with this horrible incident. There is no way he was part of this.’

Another friend, who only gave his name as Edea, added: 'Mourad is innocent, definitely. He is a good guy, a nice guy. We all like him.'

Sabine, a teenager who knew Hamyd, openly laughed at the suggestion he was in any way involved with the horrific incident.

She said: 'This is stupid. Anyone who knows Mourad knows that he has nothing to do with this. No way, no way.

'He is just a normal boy who likes normal stuff, he is not a terrorist.' 

People at the local mosque are also not convinced he could be a terrorist.

At the Amcca mosque in Charleville-Mezieres, an elderly man who knows the Hamyd family also insisted Mourad was innocent.

The man - who refused to give his name - said: 'They are a good family and Mourad is a good boy. Very tranquil and no problem.

'He prayed here before but not recently. I have not seen him recently. He has good character.

'There is no trouble with him at all, he has never had trouble with the police.

'I believe that he is innocent of these claims. This is not something that he is involved with.'
