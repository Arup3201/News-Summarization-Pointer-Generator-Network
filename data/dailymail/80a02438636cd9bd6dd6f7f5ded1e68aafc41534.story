A six-year-old girl died after falling into a giant pot of boiling hot curry at school.

Anusha Ashwathappa rushed out of class for lunch when the bell sounded.

According to the school in Chikballapur, India, she was caught between hordes of other children running through the verandah.

The government-run school near Bangalore is facing calls to explain how Anusha fell into boiling pot

When she got to the food, she was pushed and fell into the scalding sambar, it is claimed.

Anusha suffered 70 per cent burns.

When an ambulance did not arrive, the headmaster drove the little girl to the hospital, where she died hours later.

The district education officer, Krishnappa, and three school cooks are being questioned over the case.

Grieving father Gangappa Ashwathappa refused to hold a funeral until the case has been resolved.

She was taken to a hospital in Bangalore where she was treated for 70 per cent burns but later died

He said: 'I won't cremate my daughter's body until school authorities, including the headmaster and three cooks, come here.

'I want to ask them what they were doing when the children were pushing each other.'

The incident sparked outrage in the village of Gowribidanur Taluk, with calls for the staff to explain what happened.

None of the teaching staff at Darinayakanapalya Government School near Bangalore turned up to work on Wednesday amid fears the children and parents would confront them, the district's education officer explained.

Indian schools are facing calls to reform the where and how food is prepared after a series of scandals in recent months. In August at least 20 children in Bihar died after lunch

Police officers told local press they have ordered the school to give the mother and father jobs in compensation.

Sambar is a spicy vegetable stew popular in southern India. It is served boiling hot and brewed in giant vessels.

The case is the latest in a series of scandals surrounding the Mid-day Meal scheme in Indian schools.

Designed to provide free hot meals to primary school children, reports have emerged of contaminated food, poor facilities and a lack of funding throughout the country.

Teachers have called for reforms of the system and stricter controls on how and where the food can be prepared.

Last month, at least 20 children died and 60 were hospitalised in Bihar after eating a 'poisoned' lunch provided by the school.

A week earlier, 27 children in Rampur Bakhra fell ill from a curry in which authorities found a lizard.

And a dead scorpion in a meal left 39 children in Orissa vomiting throughout the afternoon.
