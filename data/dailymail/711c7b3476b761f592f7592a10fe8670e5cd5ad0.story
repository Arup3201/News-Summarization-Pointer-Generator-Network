'Potentially highly dangerous' Andre Reich wants to move to a 'softer' prison

A murderer who broke his leg in jail has launched a legal battle to be downgraded to a lower security prison - on grounds he can no longer get away.

'Potentially highly dangerous' Andre Reich says all the authorities need to do to reduce the risk he poses to society is 'take away his stick'.

Reich, now in his 60s, was jailed for life at Lewes Crown Court in 1992 for the murder of a young woman, and is currently a high security Category A prisoner at HMP Long Lartin, near Evesham.

Yesterday he won the first stage of his publicly-funded legal fight to become a Category B inmate - after he told London’s High Court his broken leg reduces his risk to the public.

The court heard Reich long ago served the 15-year minimum term set on his life sentence, but is still seen as 'potentially highly dangerous' because he has never admitted his crime.

Despite a prison panel recommending he be downgraded in April last year, the Government’s Director of High Security, Danny McAllister, blocked the move, ordering he remain under the tightest security conditions.

His decision stated: 'We are still no nearer to understanding the motivations behind his carefully planned act of violence against a young woman.

'The director also noted that his offending history had also evidenced a propensity for violence.'

But Bernard Richmond QC, for Reich, told the High Court too little regard had been given to his reduced mobility, due to his broken leg, when deciding on his prison status.

He said: 'If someone is dependent on a stick for their mobility and they are in pain, then that is a very significant matter when considering risk.

He added: 'One way to manage Mr Reich’s risk is to take his stick away.'

Lawyers for the Director of High Security conceded Reich is 'no spring chicken', but said there was no clear medical evidence to suggest his risk of reoffending was reduced.

Judge Stephen Males QC ruled Reich’s complaints 'arguable' and granted him permission for a full judicial review of the decision not to downgrade him, which will be held later this year.
