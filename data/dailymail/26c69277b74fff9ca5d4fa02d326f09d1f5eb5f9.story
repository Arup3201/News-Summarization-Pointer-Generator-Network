'Appalled': Musician Peter Gabriel has asked that his music not be played on Rush Limbaugh's show

Peter Gabriel has banned radio host Rush Limbaugh from using his music after he referred to a law student as a 'slut' last week.

Georgetown student Sandra Fluke had urged lawmakers to consider the importance of contraception coverage in health care policy.

Gabriel, an award-winning musician and prolific human rights activist, said he didn't want his song Sledgehammer to play in the background while Limbaugh launched an attack on Georgetown student Sandra Fluke, calling her a 'slut' and a 'prostitute'.

A Facebook post from Gabriel's representative stated: 'Peter was appalled to learn that his music was linked to Rush Limbaugh's extraordinary attack on Sandra Flute.

'It is obvious from anyone that knows Peter's work that he would never approve such a use.

'He has asked his representatives to make sure his music is withdrawn and especially from these unfair aggressive and ignorant comments.'

The comment, posted on Monday, was 'liked' by more than 6,000 people.

A later post from the musician, who has received the Nobel Man of Peace award, explained: 'I am a real believer in the Freedom of Speech and would defend Rush Limbaugh’s right to mouth off about almost anything.

'I just don’t like my work being used as the bed track for prejudice or hatred.'

The backlash against Limbaugh has 
intensified in recent days, as more than 40 advertisers dropped their 
support of his radio program and two stations have pulled the plug on 
it.

Taking a stand: Gabriel asked for his music to be removed from the Rush Limbaugh show after the talk show host called a law student a 'prostitute'

Limbaugh told listeners today that 'everything’s cool' despite the mass exodus, according to ABC.

He said: 'Nobody is losing money here, including us... We don’t get any revenue from ‘em anyway. The whole effort is to dispirit you.'

Even the President weighed into controversy. During President Obama's press conference yesterday at the White House, he had little to say about the controversy at first.

Obama said: 'I'm not going to comment on what sponsors decide to
do. I'm not going to comment on either
the economics or the politics of it. 

'I
don't know what's in Rush Limbaugh's heart, so I'm not going to comment on the
sincerity of his apology.'

But he said that he was compelled to offer his support to Fluke after
considering his own children, daughters Malia, 13, and Sasha, 10.

Controversy: During his first press conference of 2012, President Obama weighed in on the uproar surrounding radio host Rush Limbaugh, right, after he called Sandra Fluke a 'slut' on the air

Obama said: 'The reason I called Ms Fluke is because I
thought about Malia and Sasha, and one of the things I want them to do as they
get older is to engage in issues they care about, even ones I may not agree
with them on.'

Reaction: Georgetown University law student and activist Sandra Fluke speaks during an appearance on the daytime talk show, 'The View' about the comments he made on his programme

He added: 'I want them to be able to speak their mind in a
civil and thoughtful way.

'And I don't
want them attacked or called horrible names because they're being good
citizens.

'And I wanted Sandra to know
that I thought her parents should be proud of her, and that we want to send a
message to all our young people that being part of a democracy involves
argument and disagreements and debate, and we want you to be engaged, and
there's a way to do it that doesn't involve you being demeaned and insulted,
particularly when you’re a private citizen'.

Some 42 firms were pulling sponsorship deals from Limbaugh's radio show, fans refused to tune in and a couple of stations dropped its broadcast.

These included Carbonite, Proflowers, Tax Resolution
 Services, Legal Zoom, Citrix Success, All State, Heart and Body 
Extract, AutoZone, Quicken Loans, Sleep Train, Sleep Number, Oreck and AOL have all stopped advertising with the show.

KPUA in Hilo, Hawaii, and WBEC in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, were no longer airing the show.

Listeners of smaller, local radio stations that broadcast the syndicated show were being called on to pressure advertisers to cut all ties.

Twitter users were also spreading the message using the hashtags #BoycottRush, #StopRush and #BoycottHate.

Several Facebook pages sprung up and attracted thousands of fans to support the action. Limbaugh made a rare public apology on Saturday in the wake of the uproar caused by his comments.

But Fluke, who became Limbaugh's target after she testified about birth control before a Congressional panel, questioned the sincerity of the apology, adding that she did not want to hear from Limbaugh personally.

'The statements he’s made about me over the air are personal enough, so I’d rather not have a personal phone call with him,' Ms Fluke said on ABC’s The View.

Limbaugh admitted that his 'choice of words was not the best' and couldn’t resist taking a swipe at his opponents.

'I
 acted too much like the leftists who despise me. I descended to their 
level, using names and exaggerations,' he said. 'It’s what we’ve come to
 expect from them, but it’s way beneath me.'

Anger: Many advertisers reacted to Limbaugh's controversial 'slut' comments by suspending adverts on the programme

Decision: Citrix Systems has also decided to boycott the show

The comments amplified an election-year clash over Obama’s plan to require health insurers to cover contraception. 

Republican presidential candidates have cast the plan as an attack on religion as they court socially conservative voters. 

But they have distanced themselves from Limbaugh’s incendiary rhetoric as polls show that nearly two-thirds of voters support Obama’s plan.

Limbaugh apologised again on Monday but continued to criticize Ms Fluke’s efforts to force the Catholic university to include contraception in its health insurance coverage.

'If birth control insurance is important to you as an enrolling student … you might want to attend or work at a school that isn’t run by Catholics,' he said.

Limbaugh’s show is broadcast for three hours each weekday. Talkers Magazine, a broadcast industry trade publication, estimated that Limbaugh reaches at least 15million people a week, the most of any U.S. radio talk show.

His comments are the latest wrinkle in a 
battle over birth control and religious freedom that have emerged as a 
surprise hot-button issue in the 2012 presidential contest.

Boycott: Sleep Number Sara has also decided to suspend all advertising on the show

Religious organizations, the Catholic Church and social conservatives have protested Obama’s policy, which originally required all employers that provide health insurance to cover contraceptives, as an infringement on religious liberty.

Obama subsequently tweaked the policy so that religiously affiliated employers like hospitals, universities and charities would not be required to cover the cost. That did not satisfy Catholic bishops, who reject artificial contraceptives.

Republicans in Congress have unsuccessfully tried to repeal the new birth control rule, an effort that Democrats, in turn, have cast as a Republican 'war on women'.

The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said it has raised $1.6million since Fluke testified on Capitol Hill two weeks ago, tying the flurry of donations to outrage over the Republicans’ action.

'It’s a dramatic loser for the Republicans, because the vast majority of American women use birth control at some point in their lives,' said Southern Methodist University political science professor Cal Jillson.
