Brendan Rodgers has been crowned LMA Manager of the Year at a glittering end of season ceremony on Monday evening, becoming the first ever Liverpool boss to win the award.

The Reds manager enjoyed a brilliant season in the Anfield hotseat, guiding the Merseyside team to second in the League with Luis Suarez and Co in the title race until the final day of the season before being pipped by Manchester City.

England boss Roy Hodgson was on hand to present the 41-year-old with the award which is voted for by every manager across all four divisions.

Upon receiving the award, having narrowly missed out on the League title, Rodgers joked: 'I was hoping I'd have been on the open top bus tonight.'

Rodgers, from Northern Ireland, saw Liverpool qualify for the Champions League this term having finished seventh last season.

LMA chairman Howard Wilkinson said: ''There can be no greater tribute to a manager and his work than a tribute awarded by his match day foes and peers. This evening we applaud Brendan Rodgers as he receives that most valuable award.

'Liverpool Football Club's performances and results this season have provoked memories of some of those momentous years in the past when they had to contend with those two United’s, the first from Leeds, the second from Manchester.

'For Liverpool and Brendan, I'm sure we all hope this season marks the beginning of a new voyage and a new era.'

Meanwhile Crystal Palace boss Tony Pulis 
scooped the Barclays Premier League Manager of the Year after pulling 
off a 'miracle' to keep the Eagles in the top-flight.

The 
Selhurst Park manager masterminded the club’s incredible escape from 
relegation after taking over when they only had four points in the 
Barclays Premier League.

Palace,
 who were promoted last season via the play-offs, have an annual wage 
bill of £31m. Premier League champions Manchester City paid £233m a year in salaries in their last set of accounts.

The LMA award is based on the resources available to each manager and is voted for by its members.

Burnley boss Sean Dyche and Everton manager Roberto Martinez were the other two names on the shortlist.

Surprisingly,
 Manuel Pellegrini wasn't nominated despite guiding Manchester City to 
the Premier League title during his first season in England.

David Moyes, sacked by Manchester United in April, attended the event and presented Leicester
 boss Nigel Pearson with the Championship Manager of the Year award after the 50-year-old 
guided the Foxes to the title and subsequent promotion to the Premier 
League.

Wolves
 boss Kenny Jackett and Leyton Orient manager Russell Slade were both 
named League One Manager of the Year while Russ Wilcox, who oversaw 
Scunthorpre's promotion from the fourth division, scooped the League Two
 award.

Wilcox was also presented with the 'LMA Special Merit award' by Sir Alex Ferguson. However, throughout his speech, the former Manchester United boss continually referred to the Irons manager as 'Bruce.

The Scunthrorpe boss saw the funny side and joked: 'First of all, thanks to Sir Alex for the research; except for calling me 'Bruce' instead of Russ...'

Sheffield
 United boss Nigel Clough was named LMA FA Cup Manager of the Year after
 guiding the Blades to this season's semi-final.

Norman Rimmington received the LMA Service to Football Award after working as a Barnsley physio and kit man past his 90th birthday.

Richard Bevan, Chief Executive of the LMA, said: 'Tonight is a celebration of this season’s managerial achievements across the top four leagues in the professional game and massive congratulations are due to all award winners this evening.'
