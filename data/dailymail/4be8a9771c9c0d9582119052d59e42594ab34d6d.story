Tornadoes in the United States are increasingly hitting in swarms rather than as isolated twisters, new figures reveal.

The average number of twisters per year - around 500 - has not changed for decades.

But now as many as 115 can strike in just one day, leaving more weeks tornado-free.

And the pattern does not seem to be reverting.

Shift: Clusters of tornadoes are hitting the United States as opposed to isolated twisters, a study showed

It means emergency services already struggling to deal with large-scale hits like Hurricane Katrina will have to dramatically step up their resources. 

The study released by US government meteorologists on Thursday charted the nation's tornado database from 1954 to 2013, excluding twisters with wind speeds below 112mph.

It found that since 1970s, at least five days a year will see 20 or more tornadoes - more than double the average beforehand.

In recent years, there were on average three days with more than 30 tornadoes, compared with just one day a year four decades ago.

And on the list of the 10 single days with the most tornadoes since 1954, eight have occurred since 1999, including five since 2011. That year alone had days with 115, 73, 53 and 52 twisters.

'We need more resources … even if we don't use them very often,' Harold Brooks, an atmospheric scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) told Science.

May is the month with the most tornado activity, followed by June and April. 

Although some weather experts have blamed climate change for the shift in patterns, the report does not stipulate a cause.

'Knowing that the climate now has changed from that of the 1970s makes for a circumstantial argument in favor of a changing climate playing at least some role in the tornado changes,' said meteorologist Patrick Marsh of NOAA's Storm Prediction Center.

'There are indications that heavy rainfall events are occurring with greater frequency globally, and given a warmer climate, this makes sense,' added Storm Prediction Center meteorologist Greg Carbin.

But 'any trend in tornado events is much more difficult to discern,' Carbin added.

'The links in the chain connecting them aren't complete yet,' Brooks told Science.

Records for both the most and fewest tornadoes over a 12-month period have come in the past five years, with 1,050 from June 2010 to May 2011 and 236 tornadoes from May 2012 to April 2013.  

Tornadoes, rapidly spinning columns of air usually spawned by rotating thunderstorms, can be among the most violent weather events. 

They have been reported on every continent except Antarctica but most often hit a U.S. region covering the Great Plains and parts of the Midwest and South.

Tornadoes can cause extensive loss of life and property damage like the May 2011 twister in Joplin, Missouri, that killed about 160 people and wrecked thousands of homes.
