A number of leading British artists including Tracey Emin have lost tens of thousands of pounds after investing in a failed West End restaurant and hotel.

The St John Hotel was launched in a blaze of publicity by celebrity offal chef Fergus Henderson, but went into administration after a series of high-profile misfortunes.

While the premises has remained open under a new owner, its 'ambassador shareholders' such as Ms Emin and fellow artists Peter Doig and Sarah Lucas have lost their investments in the venture.

The 15-room hotel was spearheaded by Mr Henderson, known as the 'king of offal', and its restaurant was so well-regarded that it was awarded a Michelin star in the autumn.

But a delay in the opening date, ongoing building work outside its Leicester Square building, and the slump in the hospitality industry during the Olympics meant that it was forced into administration in October, the Evening Standard has reported.

The company that owned the hotel, St John Chinatown Ltd, sold the business to a Singaporean tycoon, and the hotel and restaurant are both still open.

Full details of the saga emerged for the first time in a report to creditors drawn up by administrators Tim Dolder and Trevor Binyon, of corporate restructuring firm RSM Tenon.

The document shows that shareholders — many of them 'well known' friends of the founders — stumped up a total of £2.25million to back the development, on what was the site of fish restaurant Manzi’s.

Loss-making venture: St John Hotel and Restaurant in Leicester Square, London, has gone into administration

Henderson, founder of St John restaurant in Smithfield, is famed for his 'nose to tail' style of cooking.

When
the hotel opened he described it as 'cheeky in a nice way', with a bar 
that would serve all night and a kitchen 'like an 18th century man o’ 
war', adding: 'The spirit of the place is "Yes".'

But
the administrators’ report reveals that the owners had already suffered
a disastrous catalogue of setbacks since first drawing up their plans 
in 2007.

They hired staff and took guest bookings for Christmas 2010 after the builders said the hotel would be ready in time.

In fact it was not fit to open until April 2011, and even then, further 'snagging' problems meant that only half of the rooms could be used. As a result the hotel lost £1.4million in its first trading year.

In addition, Westminster council’s lengthy makeover of Leicester Square meant that 'builders' materials and site waste was regularly found outside of the premises, and at times the only view from the restaurant windows was that of the construction works.' The restaurant was also unable to use its outdoor seating terrace.

Tough economic conditions, exacerbated 
by the 'negative impact' on restaurants caused by the Olympics, pushed 
the hotel into insolvency on 19 October, after the directors decided 
they did not want to provide any extra funding.

The hotel is now out of administration under its new ownership.  It has remained open and traded profitably since October, with occupancy rates close to 90 per cent. However, a £2.98million shortfall at St John Chinatown Ltd means the original shareholders are unlikely to get their money back.

They also included gallery owner Sadie Coles, ceramicist Jane Hamlyn, American painter Elizabeth Peyton, Littlewoods heir and art collector James Moores, and writer Guy Kennaway.

Trevor Gulliver said they were being 'very supportive' despite the probable loss of their investments. He added: 'They are all grown ups, no one put in millions or hundreds of thousands.' The rest of the St John restaurant group was unaffected by the administration, he said.

'Everyone is quietly working through what has been a very difficult process to protect jobs and suppliers. The restaurant is still cooking well and the hotel is busy. It has improved the streetscape and it will still be a happy and successful building in 10, 20, 30 years time.'

The new owner is Loh Lik Peng, a Singaporean hotelier who also owns a venue converted from Bethnal Green Town Hall. He bought St John Hotel for an undisclosed sum.
