A three-year-old Manchester United fan burst into tears at the thought of having to wear a blue school uniform every day.

Lilly Rae Doyle sobbed uncontrollably while trying on the uniform due to the fact it was blue like the shirt of United's local rivals Manchester City.

Despite reassurances that everyone at school would be wearing the uniform, Lilly repeatedly cried: 'I don't like blue. I want to take it off.'

Lilly's mother, 28-year-old Faye Cummins, was not surprised by her daughter's reaction.

Speaking to Manchester Evening News, she said: 'I knew she wasn’t going to be happy. 

'She just loves United, she is such an avid fan and loves everything to do with them. It’s always United, United, United.

'Most of my family are City fans, it’s just me and my sister that are United. They’ve all seen the video and they all think it’s quite funny, they’d much rather she was a Blue.'
