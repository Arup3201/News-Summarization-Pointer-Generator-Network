A mother has turned her post baby bulge to biceps, transforming her 17st body to become a champion powerlifter.

Lisa James, 29, from Llanelli, South Wales, started to pile on the pounds after the birth of her second child and at her heaviest she weighed 17st and struggled to fit into size 20 clothes.

But less than two years later the mother-of-two is now a champion powerlifter, holding both the British and European records.

Lisa started to gain weight when she was pregnant with her second child (right) but has now totally transformed her body by taking up power lifting (left)

Lisa initially lost 4st in a year by drastically cutting her calories, but said she was very unhappy with her body

Auxiliary nurse Lisa started to count her calories and within a year her weight had plummeted to just 9st.

She said: 'I lost the weight very quickly, about 4st just fell off. At my lightest I weighed 9st and was a size eight, but I just wasn’t happy.

'I’d lost my boobs and had a lot of loose skin as I lost the weight so quickly. I felt really self-conscious and it put a strain on my relationship, I couldn’t bear him touching me.

'I was also really tired and was feeling quite low. Then my partner - the dad of my kids - went off and had an affair, which made everything much worse.'

In a bid to get back some of her self-confidence Lisa decided to have a boob job and increased her cup size to 34DD.

But it was only when she took a job at her local gym that she decided to start improving her body by working out.

Lisa says while she was unhappy being large (right), neither was she confident when she weighed 9st, and it is only since starting powerlifting (pictured with trophies, left) that she likes her body

Now the part-time personal trainer is a healthy size 10-12 and is more confident than she’s ever been.

Lisa said: 'Initially I did all the usual stuff at the gym. But I was getting bored of doing the same sort of thing all the time and took up powerlifting.

'I’d see all the girls going to classes, but I wanted to try something totally different and have something to train for.

'Powerlifting really pushed me to my limits and I was instantly obsessed with it. I love training hard and seeing the results.

Although she doesn't weigh herself Lisa is a healthy size and says she has never felt more confident

'One year after I started losing weight I entered and won the 2013 Wales’ Strongest Woman competition. And then went on to win the World Championship Powerlifting in Chicago.

'I must have known I was overweight but now I find it hard to believe that I didn’t do anything about it sooner.

'But being skinny didn’t make me happy - I’m heavier now but I’m fit and healthy. It was the powerlifting that really made the difference.

'I cut out all bad foods and allowed myself one cheat a week and as the weight came off it gave me more motivation to keep going, my diet now is a bit different as I have to eat every three hours to keep my metabolism fast and I have to eat a high protein diet along with complex carbs and good fats.

'Powerlifting really pushed me to my limits and I was instantly obsessed with it. I love training hard and seeing the results' Lisa says

'I don't have dairy and I don't eat any processed food or have any salt or sugar, I have a diet to follow pre-competition and I use Avenches biotech supplements to assist with my training - I'm sponsored by them and have the best advice and products off them to help me.'

'It’s changed me as a whole person. I’m more independent and I’m motivated.'

The young mother is adamant that powerlifting is not just for men and actively encourages other women to take up strength sports.

She said: 'I keep everything girly. All my kit is pink. That’s the message I want to give to girls: You don’t have to be manly if you’re a powerlifter, it’s about being strong and fit.'

Lisa’s healthy outlook is something she hopes to pass onto her two children Kacey, six, and four-year-old Jacob.

She said: 'My whole experience has made me want to motivate other people.

'I now run seminars to inspire other women to change their life, which is exactly what I did.

'I look better and feel better than ever before. I’m known as the Power Princess, which I think sums me up pretty well.'
