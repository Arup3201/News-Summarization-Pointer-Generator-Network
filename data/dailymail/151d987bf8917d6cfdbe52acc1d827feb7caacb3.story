It is the romantic moment everyone wants to get just right, so it is no surprise this love-struck man enlisted some help to propose to his girlfriend.

The romantic Macedonian, named Ivan, took over a square in the city of Skopje with a whole dancing flash mob to ask for his girlfriend Jana's hand in marriage.

And in an ironic twist, it was his choreographer girlfriend herself who taught the dancers their routine.  

Jana was told that a Macedonian politician wanted to propose to his girlfriend and was asked to choreograph a routine for the occasion.

But it was only at the end of the flash mob that her boyfriend of four years cam e forward and actually revealed he was the client.

Ivan got the idea as he needed to put together a commercial at the square for a wedding fair so he decided to use the moment to propose.

During the video dozens of talented flash mob dancers are seen dancing in the city's main square and after their routine is finished they remove their jackets to reveal t-shirts with the question - Will you marry me?

Jana smiles and laughs excitedly as the her romantic boyfriend comes forward and actually presents her with a ring.

The choreographer was confused by her boyfriend's surprise proposal but in the end she happily says yes.

Large numbers of people are seen cheering, clapping and taking photographs of the couple as they kiss and embrace on the square.

The Bruno Mars' single Marry You plays poignantly in the background during the memorable video.

Ivan and Jana were married on September 13.
