A Harvard University student, 21, accused of making a bomb threat to get out of a final exam may avoid federal prosecution.

The U.S. attorney's office asked a judge to defer Eldo Kim's prosecution to allow him to undergo a pretrial diversion program.

The arrangement requires the 21-year-old to serve four months of home confinement, pay restitution to agencies that responded to the alleged threat, complete 750 hours of community service and publicly apologize.

Federal prosecutors announced on Friday they charged Kim in what's called a criminal information with emailing several bomb threats to offices associated with the university nearly 10 months ago.

He previously was charged in a criminal complaint.

The government would drop charges if the court agrees to defer Kim's prosecution and he successfully abides by all the terms of pretrial diversion.

Kim was freed on $100,000 bond after making an initial court appearance in December of last year.

Eldo Kim's attorney, Ian Gold, said his client was under a great deal of pressure and seems to regret his actions.

‘He’s a very remorseful, shattered young man,’ Gold said.

The exam fell on the third anniversary of his father's death.

Under the conditions of his release, he cannot enter Harvard’s campus without prior approval of Harvard and the federal court, other than to retrieve his belongings with an escort.

Mr Gold, a federal public defender, said Kim was dealing with the pressure of finals and the third anniversary of the death of his father, a professor at a South Korean university.

According to the lawyer, Kim became a naturalized U.S. citizen in fifth grade and renounced his South Korean citizenship.

Kim, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, has been charged with sending the electronic threats to multiple offices associated with the Ivy League university.

Kim confessed to sending the emails from an anonymous address in order to get out of taking an exam, according to court documents.

The missives falsely warned there were 'shrapnel bombs placed in science center, sever hall, emerson hall, thayer hall, 2/4. guess correctly. be quick for they will go off soon.'

The subject line of the emails read 'bombs placed around campus.'

He lists his graduation date as 2016 in an article he wrote in April for the Harvard Independent.

He also performed with the Harvard Breakers dance troupe.

If he were convicted, he could face a maximum of five years in prison an a fine of $250,000.

Kim attended Kamiak High School, graduating in June 2012, Andy Muntz, a spokesman for the Mukilteo School District, said Wednesday.

While there, Kim was a National Merit Scholarship finalist and participated on the tennis and debate teams, Muntz said.

Authorities said Kim told them he emailed the bomb threats about a half-hour before he was scheduled to take a final in Emerson Hall. He said he was there at 9 a.m. when he heard the alarm sound and knew his plan had worked, according to an FBI affidavit.

On Saturday night before the exam, Kim sent an email over his dorm Listserv, The Harvard Crimson reported.

Under pressure: Kim's lawyer has said that Eldo Kim didn't want to take the exam on the third anniversary of his father's death and that he was under extreme pressure 

‘I was wondering if anyone had taken GOV 1368: The Politics of American Education (Paul Peterson) in the past,’ Kim wrote in the email. ‘I have several quick questions about the course.’

As a sophomore at Kamiak, Kim was a National Peace Essay Contest winner with other students nationwide, a program sponsored by the federally-funded United States Institute of Peace, whose mission is to 'increase the nation's capacity to manage international conflict without violence

His contest biography described him as a member of varsity tennis and the swim team, as well as the debate team.

‘Eldo is also a member of National Honor Society and tutors students in mathematics. He is enrolled in the Seattle Conservatory of Music and plays the viola,’ the biography said.

Kim also was described as a voluntary research assistant for a professor at Korea University, and has assisted in the development of a model for public acceptance of the management of radioactive waste.

‘During the summer of 2008, he traveled with fellow high school students to Peru and rebuilt rural communities,’ the biography said. ‘He enjoys writing and competing in sports. Eldo plans to major in Political Science and is excited for what the future holds in the coming years.’

Two hours after threats were sent to officials and the Harvard Crimson newspaper, authorities had already decided they were likely a hoax.

Investigators from several agencies searched the buildings for hours before determining there were no explosives. One of the buildings was a freshman dormitory; classes are held in the other three.

In a statement to the Harvard community, Harvard Executive Vice President Katie Lapp said that the buildings were evacuated ‘out of an abundance of caution’ and that activities at the Ivy League school in Cambridge were returning to normal.

‘I am relieved to report that no suspicious devices were found,’ Lapp said in her statement.
