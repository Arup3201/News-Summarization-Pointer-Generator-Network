A finance worker has been jailed after stealing more than half-a-million pounds from wealthy clients - so she could play online bingo.

Patricia Lomas, 55, funnelled cash from investors into her own accounts to fund her internet gambling addiction.

She blew vast sums of money then stole even more in a doomed attempt to claw back her losses by winning the jackpot, Jersey’s Royal Court heard.

Lomas spent a total of £759,625 on gaming websites in five years, of which £542,610 was taken from other people’s accounts.

She admitted taking the money, telling the court she was a 'hostage' to her gambling habit - but was jailed for four years.

Deputy Bailiff William Bailhache told her: 'You did have six members of staff under you. Although not at director level you have a position of responsibility inside the company.

'The court sentences you on this indictment to four years. It does so with regret because we understand that you are remorseful and you realise what you have done.'

The court heard Lomas abused her position to manipulate reports and doctor statements while she was an investment support manager at Ashburton (Jersey) Limited.

By the time the money was found missing in 2013 she had spent £10,000 on dental work, £3,400 on laser eye surgery and £12,795 on a car.

But Crown Advocate David Hopwood told the court the vast majority of the money was spent on internet bingo and other gaming websites.

Lomas spent £6,805 on her habit in 2008 but started to bet much bigger sums after she began raiding her clients’ accounts in January 2009.

As she tried in vain to win back her losses, she spent more and more, frittering away £276,765 between January and November 2013 and betting an average of £228 each time she played.

Lomas, who moved from Manchester to the Channel Islands in 1983, wept as her crimes were described to Jersey’s Superior Number, which only sits for the island’s most serious cases.

Advocate Alexander English, defending, said her gambling addiction was triggered by the 'stresses and strains' of her working environment.

He said she was of previous good character, had cooperated fully with police and even told her employers about potential 'deficiencies' in their operating practices.

Mr English said: 'She then became hostage to this ill-fated decision.

'She never won enough money to pay back the money she stole, leading her to steal more and more in the vain hope she would win the jackpot to win it back.'

Lomas admitted one count of larceny at the earliest possible opportunity.

But Deputy Bailiff Bailhache said he did not view a gambling addiction as a mitigating factor.
