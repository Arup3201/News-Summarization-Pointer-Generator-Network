Zenit St Petersburg's Brazilian striker Hulk was racially abused by fans during a game against Spartak Moscow, according to Russia's Sport Express newspaper.

The Russian football federation's disciplinary commission chief Artur Grigoryants was quoted as saying an investigation was underway after a match delegate noted monkey chants were aimed at Hulk during the 0-0 stalemate.

The striker, who signed for Zenit from Porto in 2012, told Russian media he heard the chants from a 'large group of people' and that he took it as a 'personal insult'.
