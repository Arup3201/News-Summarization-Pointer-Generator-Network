An 11-year-old boy has been banned from joining the Scouts because he does not believe in God and refuses to swear allegiance.

George Pratt had attended his local Scout group for ten months before scoutmasters invited him to invest in the group.

But the schoolboy, from Radstock, Somerset, refused to make the Scout Promise which includes doing one’s ‘duty to God and to the Queen’.

Atheist: George Pratt, 11, will not swear allegiance to God as required in the Scout Promise. The movement is unashamed of its religious roots and allows children of other faiths to pledge allegiance

The Scouts centre in Radstock where George had been going for ten months before he was asked to invest in the Scouts

Although variations in wording are permitted for members of non-Christian religions, there is no exception made for atheists.

As a result he cannot join because children of all faiths must make the promise to God if they want to become part of the organisation.

Yesterday the Scout Association refused to back down. A spokesman said: ‘Faith has been an important tenet of the movement for 105 years.’

'All young people are required to make the Scout Promise if they wish to
become a Scout.

'Variations 
of the Scout Promise are available for different faiths (such as the use
of 'Allah' to replace 'God' for Muslim Scouts), however all the 
variations of the promise recognise the 'Duty to God' element.

'Young
people are required to show both an understanding, relevant to their 
age, and an acceptance of the promise before they become a member.

'Young
people will not be refused membership solely because of their parents’ 
beliefs or non-beliefs, however they are required to make the promise as
outlined above.

'Furthermore,
Scouting accepts that as they grow into independent adults, some young 
people may question or doubt the existence of God as they develop their 
personal spiritual understanding.

'Scouting believes that young people going through this process should be able to remain a Scout.'

George says he is 'disappointed' and was look forward to going caving with the group

However, his father Nick, 45, is furious about the decision and has accused the Christian movement of being ‘intolerant’.

He said: 'Christianity is meant to be about being tolerant, forgiving and understanding.

'You are allowed to join if you are a Christian or a Muslim but you can’t not believe in God. He’s being excluded because he doesn’t believe.

'I’ve brought George up to be courteous, kind and considerate.

'He’s a clever child and came to the decision himself, he doesn’t believe in God and doesn’t believe the world was was formed in seven days.

'This is George's choice and if he changes his mind in six months’ time then that is fine by me, as long as he has made an informed choice.'

Refusal: Children of all faiths can join the scouts. Muslim children, for example, can swear duty to Allah

George began attending the 1st Midsomer Norton Group in Somerset - which meets in a hall opposite his house - in January.

But to become a full member he must now take the Scout Promise, which reads:

'On my honour, I promise that I will do my best, to do my duty to God and to the Queen, to help other people, and to keep the Scout Law.'

George is sad that he cannot join but will not say the words required by all scouts who wish to become a part of the movement

Scouting was founded by Lord Robert Baden-Powell of Gilwell (1857-1941), a decorated soldier, talented artist, actor and free-thinker.

His experiences during the Boer War propelled him to develop a training programme for young people in Britain.

In 1907, encouraged by his friends, he held an experimental camp on Brownsea Island, Poole, Dorset, to try out his ideas. He brought together 20 boys, some from public schools and some from working class homes, and put them into camp under his leadership. The movement was born.

Scouting for Boys was published in 1908 and sales of the book were enormous.

What had been intended as a training aid for existing organisations became the handbook of a new and, ultimately, worldwide movement.

Scouting for Boys has since been translated into many different languages and dialects.

There are now around 28million Scouts worldwide

George called the decision 'very unfair' and says he is missing out on the adventures Scouts enjoy because of his atheism.

He said: 'I am really disappointed about not being able to go anymore just because I don’t believe in God.

'We have spoken about it with the Scout Leader but he won’t change his decision, it is very unfair.

'My friends who are Scouts don’t think it is right, either.

'Everyone is going caving soon and I’ve never been before. It is something I would love to do but I’m not allowed.

'I’m not going to change my decision though.'

The Scout Movement was founded by Robert Baden-Powell in 1907 and adventurer Bear Grylls is the UK’s current Chief Scout.

The ‘Born Survivor’ star, famed for his death-defying challenges, has spoken strongly about his Christianity in the past.

Mr Pratt, who lives with wife Kate, 40 and 14-year-old son Henry, is surprised that the Scouting movement is not willing to accept George.

He said: 'To be invested into the Scouts you have to believe in a God but it does not say which religion that God is from.

'So you can be Muslim or Buddhist, but if you have the courage to stand up and admit that you do not believe in any God then look out because you are not welcome into the Scout community.

'George had the guts to stand up and admit his view and I believe the Scouts are being narrow-minded.'
