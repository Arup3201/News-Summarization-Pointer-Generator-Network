Authorities say a University of Richmond student shot and killed late Wednesday night appears to have been the target of a mysterious homicide plot, despite being described as a friendly teen with straight-A grades.

Brendan Tevlin, 19, of Livingston, New Jersey, was home for the summer after his freshman year of college when police discovered his body riddled with bullets in the seat of a Jeep Liberty in the parking lot of an apartment building.

West Orange police found him in the area - around six miles from his family home - after responding to a report of shots fired. Earlier in the night, the 'model' student texted his mother to say he was traveling home from a friend's house.

'At this juncture of the investigation it does not appear to be random,' Anthony Ambrose,  the chief of 
detectives for the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office, told The Star-Ledger.

Ambrose's homicide and major crimes task force is investigating.

He could not comment on potential motives or identify potential suspects as the investigation is ongoing. No arrests have been made.

An unidentified friend told NJ.com the Jeep Tevlin was found in belonged to a family member.

Before his death, Tevlin had been at a friend's house playing video games and texted his mother to say he was coming home.

'We’re literally just reeling in this tragedy,' the friend told the website.

She added that the family had been interviewed by detectives but were still at a loss for a possible motive.

'This is so out of character. He was literally a good kid. No enemies — he always avoided controversy,' she said. 'The world lost a terrific kid.'

The oldest of four children, family and friends described him as a kind person with a sociable personality.

'People need to know what kind of person he was,' said Christian Breslin, who played on the lacrosse team with Tevlin at Seton Hall.

'This kid,
 there was nothing bad about him. He was one of the nicest people I’ve 
ever known.'

The prep school's head, Monsignor Michael Kelly, said the entire school was grieving.

'Brendan was a wonderful young man, friend of everyone, liked by 
all,' he wrote in a news release.

'Our community is praying for the 
family and his grandparents, who were very close to Brendan and to Seton
 Hall Prep.'

Crime scene: Police have yet to make an arrest in the case but say it appears to have been a planned shooting at the apartment complex in West Orange, New Jersey

During his four years at the school he also volunteered for Knights of Setonia, a community service group.

Ed Ayers, school president of the University of Richmond, said he had planned a business major and was active in sports.

Dozens expressed their grief on Twitter after hearing the news.

'You were a great friend and brother to many,' wrote one user.

Another wrote: 'Brendan Tevlin was everything that was right in this world, and the 
monster that took his life is everything that’s wrong with it. RIP.'
