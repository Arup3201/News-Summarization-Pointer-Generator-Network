Gray Allan Ormandy, 23 throttled his girlfriend in a row over Grand Theft Auto V

A father-of-three throttled his girlfriend after she objected to him playing the new Grand Theft Auto V game with his friends after midnight.

Rachael Lawson complained when Gray Allan Ormandy, 23, arrived home after midnight with the new game, and then started playing it with two friends.

Mr Ormandy snapped, and squeezed her neck until she could not breathe as one of her children begged him to stop, Furness Magistrates’ Court in Cumbria, heard.

The couple had regular arguments, but the row on September 17 started when Ormandy went to buy the game at its special official midnight launch, said Lisa Hine, prosecuting.

Miss Lawson was in bed, but was woken by a barking dog and came down to find Ormandy back home with two friends.

She asked the friends to leave around 20 minutes later and Ormandy slept on the sofa.

Mrs Hine said Miss Lawson asked Ormandy to help with the children the next morning, but he refused.

As the row escalated in the bedroom of their Mount Pleasant home, Ormandy grabbed his girlfriend around the neck and squeezed until she could not breathe.

Mrs Hine said the three children - all aged under five - saw what happened and one said: 'Stop it.'

Miss Lawson took the children downstairs and called the police at 8.30am.

Following his arrest, Ormandy told police 'she hates me having a computer' and said she 'smashed the last one'.

He said he came back with some mates and Miss Lawson was 'stressing' and made his mates 'uncomfortable'.

Mrs Hine said Miss Lawson wanted to make up and did not wish to pursue a restraining order.

Ormandy, who was bailed to Fife Street, Barrow, admitted assault when he appeared in court on Tuesday.

Mr Trystan Roberts, defending, said he pleaded guilty on the basis he held her jaw line and argued it was not in front of the children.

Mr Roberts said: 'He is bitterly sorry he is now away from them.

He is, by all accounts, an extremely good father.

'Unfortunately, things have been very stressful recently and his younger brother, for whom he has cared for much of his life, has become homeless and his mum is on a third drugs conviction and is in prison at the moment.'

Sentencing was adjourned until Tuesday for a report to be prepared by the probation service.

District Judge Gerald Chalk said: 'You assaulted the mother of your children in the home, where she should feel safe.

'The children were present and would’ve been petrified by what they saw.'
