LA Galaxy star Robbie Rogers has again hit out at FIFA, saying the decision to host the World Cup in both Russia and Qatar is a 'kick in the balls' for homosexual athletes around the world.

The former Leeds United player has made 18 appearances for the USA at international level, but concedes the decision to hold tournaments in these countries makes it difficult for gay professional athletes to compete.

And Rogers, who became the first professional football player in Britain to come out since Justin Fashanu in 1990, believes it is about time football's governing body lived up to their own mission statement.

'The decision to hold the World Cup in Russia and then in Qatar seems a little bit crazy to me to be totally honest, it's ignorant, very ignorant,' said Rogers at an MLS media event.

'They're meant to be trying create a better world through soccer and educations through communities, everybody under the roof of football.'

Homosexuality is illegal in Qatar and in 2013 Russian president Vladimir Putin signed into a bill that banned the 'propaganda of non-traditional sexual relations to minors'.

Rogers added: 'By holding the World Cup in those countries you are not sending that message. You're sending a message that is a bit discriminatory I believe. I think human rights in general in those countries is not spot on

'But it's tough being an openly gay athlete, it's tough for me as somebody who has played at international level with a national team to see those decisions being made.

'It's a kick in the balls to be honest.'
