A henchman of ousted Libyan dictator Muammar Gadaffi has escaped from a Paris hospital wearing nothing from the waist down, police revealed today.

Former army colonel Abdusalam Aboudajaja, 68, was sent to France for treatment for a brain condition by the new Libyan government earlier this year.

But he  and is now being hunted across France after fleeing the medical ward in only his pyjama top.

His presence at the Val-de-Grace military hospital was monitored by police every day but he was not considered to be a 'flight risk'.

But when his family visited him this month, they were unable to find him in his room.

After searching for Col Aboudajaja for hours, they finally alerted police.

CCTV footage then revealed the former soldier walking alone out of the 
hospital's main entrance wearing only his pyjama top and underwear.

His cousin Najah Benmoftah said: 'He often appeared a bit disorientated, so we first assumed he was lost in the building.

'But he were horrified to see on film that he had simply walked out.'

Col Aboudajaja was arrested after allied forces toppled Col Gadaffi's tyrannical regime last year.

The hospital had been examining whether the ex-soldier's brain condition could have been caused by contact with radioactive materials during his military career, Mrs Benmoftah said.

He vanished on August 6, but news of the disappearance was not released by police until today.

A Paris police spokesman said: 'An alert was immediately sent out to police stations around France.

'We have been searching for two weeks but have found no trace of him.

'We are not ruling out any hypothesis, either that he was lost and disorientated, that he escaped or was even kidnapped.'
