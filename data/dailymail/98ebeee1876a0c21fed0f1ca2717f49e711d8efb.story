German football authorities have promised to stamp out racism in the stands after an Israeli football player was subjected to Heil Hitler! salutes and sordid chants about the Holocaust at a training game.

Germany's Football Federation the DFB said it 'will not tolerate anti-Semitic or racist attacks' after a small group of people verbally abused Israeli player Itay Shechter during a Kaiserslautern practice session.

The incident took place on Sunday, a day after relegation-threatened Kaiserslautern's 4-0 defeat at Mainz 05.

The group gave the Heil Hitler! salute, shouted out 'sieg Heil' - the Nazi party greeting during the Third Reich - and shouted a vile chant about him joining 'the six million'.

This is a reference to the number of Jews exterminated by the Nazis during World War II.

'Together with the president we want to underline that the DFB will not tolerate such actions and we must act decisively,' said Wolfgang Niersbach, who is due to become the new DFB boss next month.

The Israeli embassy in Berlin made a complaint about the abuse suffered by one of its citizens.

'Racism and anti-Semitism have no place in football. We must defend ourselves against this and we wish that the authorities chase up this incident,' added Niersbach.

Police have launched an investigation to identify those involved while the club, which has called on fans to help identify the people involved, condemned the incident saying those responsible were not football fans.

'The players understood the feelings, views and fears of the fans,' Kaiserslautern chairman Stefan Kuntz said on Tuesday on the meeting with the Kaiserslautern fans.

'As a conclusion, it is this meeting with 300 club fans that should be in focus and not the inexcusable behaviour of a handful of radicals.'

The display of Nazi symbols, greetings and slogans is banned in Germany and there have been growing concerns since the revelations last November that an extremist right-wing cell calling itself the Nationalist Socialist Underground lay behind the killings of 10 people, eight Turks, a Greek and a German policewoman ovder a 13 year period.

The German government's own survey revealed earlier this month that anti-Smitism is on the rise, particularly among the young.

Last Thursday, on the day that Germany held a day of mourning for the victims of the NSU death squad, a photograph emerged of a masked Berlin policeman giving the Hitler salute on the Facebook social networking site.
