The family who died in a plane crash in Kentucky were traveling home from visiting their son at a naval base in Florida when their plane went down, it has been revealed.

Their seven-year-old daughter, Sailor Gutzler, is the only survivor of the crash after the Piper Seneca went down Friday evening near KY 810 South in Lyon County. 

The accident killed Sailor's father, Marty Gutzler, 49, mother Kimberly Gutzler, 45, her nine-year-old daughter, Piper, and her cousin 14-year-old Sierra Wilder.

Family friend Troy Dunbar, who worked at Mr Gutzler's furniture store in Nashville, IL, told Heartland News, Mrs Gutlzer's adult son, Nick Brink, is in the military stationed in Key West and the family were coming back from visiting for the holidays.

Crash: This Piper PA-34-200T owned by an Illinois doctor crashed in rural southwestern Kentucky Friday, killing four people on board. A 7-year-old girl walked away from the crash with only minor injuries 

Today a rescuer revealed how the bloody and barefoot girl seven-year-old knocked on his door to beg for help after crawling free from a Kentucky plane crash.

Larry Wilkins, 71, told NBC News in a phone interview late Friday night that the 'brave' 7-year-old came knocking on his door after emerging from the plane wreckage at 6:30 p.m. (7:30 p.m. ET).

'The little girl come to my door,' said Wilkins.

'She was bleeding pretty bad, her legs were bleeding, her face had a bloody nose. 

She was barefoot, only had one sock on.'

'She told me that her mom and her dad were dead, and she was in a plane crash, and the plane was upside down,' he said. 

Larry Wilkins found Sailor on his doorstep and took her in before calling 911

'She asked if she could stay here,' Wilkins recalled.

He immediately called 911 and then went to work cleaning up the bloodied girl with a washcloth.

When police arrived, the little girl was so shaken up she could hardly make herself understood.

'I felt so sorry for her, tears come my eyes,' said Wilkins who described the little girl's journey as 'very, very rough territory.'

A spokesman for the family, Kent Plotner, issued a statement Saturday afternoon that read: 'The Gutzler family mourns the loss of Marty, Kim and Piper Gutzler and Sienna Wilder. 

'We are devastated by this loss, but are confident that they rest in God's loving arms. Please pray for us, especially for Sailor Gutzler.'  

Sgt. Dean Patterson of the Kentucky State Police says the FAA received a distress call at 5.55pm from a private plane in the area around the time the girl reported the crash to a resident

The resident called 911 at 6.30pm and the seven-year-old was taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries - she has now been released. 

According to local reports, the aircraft was flying from Key West, Florida, to Mt Vernon, Illinois, at the time of the accident.

The FAA Memphis Center confirmed that there was a distress call from a private plane in the area of the crash. 

The last contact was at 1,800 feet.

Kathleen Bergen of the FAA says air traffic controllers lost contact with a Piper PA-34-200T as it was flying over Marshall County in the southwestern part of the state.

The pilot had reported engine problems. 

'I've got an 8-year-old child myself, that just turned 8-years-old. And when I saw this [what] appeared to be a 7-year-old child that walked through this dense Forrest,' Lieutenant Brent White with the Kentucky State Police told KFVS.

'Through some really tough terrain. Awful poor weather conditions – and survive this, it's just really a miracle.'

Kentucky State Police Lt. White said emergency crews ' worked tirelessly to find this wreckage and hopefully salvage the lives of those that were on board. But, ultimately, it just wasn't meant to be.' 

Mr Dunbar said Mr Gutzler had been flying since he was 16 and was a very experienced pilot.
