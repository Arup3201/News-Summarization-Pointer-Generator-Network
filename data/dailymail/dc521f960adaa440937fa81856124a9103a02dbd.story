Arsenal and Juventus held discussions on Monday morning over a possible loan move for Lukas Podolski.

There have been complications to shift the World Cup-winning Germany striker from England's Premier League to Italy's Serie A, though, as his £3million wages pose a problem.

Juventus feel Podolski's salary is too rich for their blood, given Arsenal's high loan fee.

Rich: Podolski's £3million wages and Arsenal's high loan fee mean Juventus aren't keen on the asking price

VfL Wolfsburg have offered a permanent move but Podolski would prefer Juventus if it can be done.

The German posted a black and white snap of himself to his Instagram account on Monday afternoon and wrote: 'Things work out best for those who  make the best of the way things work out. Opportunities don't happen, you create them! #StayFocus #NoExcuses #FightForYourGoals #BeStrong #Champs #Victory #Glory #Poldi #aha'.

The 29-year-old was left out of Arsenal's squad for their match at Everton, and posted a picture of inside Cologne's stadium while his teammates were at Goodison Park.

Podolski did, however, tweet good luck: 'I won't be present in person but my thoughts are there with you lads. Good luck at the match, go and represent, bring us the 3 points.'

Message: Podolski posted a black and white snap of himself on Monday and insisted 'things work out best for those who make the best of the way things work out'
