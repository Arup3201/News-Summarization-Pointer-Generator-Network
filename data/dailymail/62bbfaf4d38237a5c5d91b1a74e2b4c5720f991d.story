Real Madrid and Manchester United target Danilo was rushed to hospital on Tuesday night after a sickening collision with his own goalkeeper during Porto's 4-0 Champions League win against Basle.

The Brazilian right back appeared to momentarily knocked unconscious after Fabiano came rushing out of his area to make a headed clearance.

Danilo, with his eyes on the ball, failed to see the on-rushing keeper as the pair came together with Fabiano's shoulder making contact with the unfortunate full back's face.

The defender's head snapped back under the force of the collision as Danilo collapsed to the turf seemingly knocked out.

After a lengthy stoppage in play Danilo left the field on a stretcher with his neck in a brace before being loaded into an ambulance and taken to hospital.

It was later revealed by the Porto press officer that Danilo was conscious and following a medical examination was cleared of any serious injury.

That news will be well-received by Real Madrid who, Sportsmail understands, already have an agreement in place to sign the Brazil international in the summer for a fee in the region of £27million.

Potuguese paper A Bola have also reported that a move to the Spanish giants at the end of the season has been agreed. Carlo Ancelotti, however, denies a deal has been completed.

Danilo has also been attracting interest from Manchester United with club officials making checks over the proposed move to Real Madrid.

Luis van Gaal is in the market fro a new right back. Having been unimpressed by Rafael the United boss has persevered with playing Antonio Valencia - who was at fault for both goals in the FA Cup defeat by Arsenal on Monday - out of position.
