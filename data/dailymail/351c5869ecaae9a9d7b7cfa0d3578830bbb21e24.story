A defiant Manuel Pellegrini believes that Manchester City can avoid Champions League elimination and still be crowned kings of Europe this season - even though 'five or six squads' in the competition are better than theirs.

The Premier League champions are on the brink of disaster after picking up two points from their opening three Group E games, and must beat CSKA Moscow at the Etihad on Wednesday night to keep alive their chances of qualifying for the knockout stage.

But Pellegrini insists that City can beat the odds by sneaking out of the group phase with a low points total and go on to win the competition.

‘There are teams that qualify with few points and then after that they won the Champions League,’ said Pellegrini.

‘Of course our target is always to try and win the Champions League. We must put in our mind that we are able to do it, that we have a good squad.

‘Maybe there are also five or six squads better than our squad or the same level as our squad that also want to do it but with a winning mentality and an ambitious mind, you must always think you can do it. I think we have time to prove it.

‘We have to play three games more. This year, all the games we had to play against big teams, we didn’t lose in one of them. We drew with Chelsea and Arsenal in the league, we beat Tottenham and Manchester United. 

'We have to finish the qualifying (stage) and then we can make all the conclusions and analyse what happened with this team in Champions League.’

Having lost their opening game to Bayern Munich, City have suffered disappointing draws after surrendering leads to Roma and CSKA.

Pellegrini denied that his players lack confidence in Europe, and predicted that the group will not be decided until final game in Rome next month.

He added: ‘The three games of the Champions League were strange games I think. We were very unlucky to lose against Bayern Munich, the most difficult game of the group in the last minute with the rebound of the set-piece.

‘After that, here against Roma we didn’t play well and Roma were in a very good moment. And in Russia I think we played very well but with an excess of trust we couldn’t win but we are planning to arrange that and I hope we will do it.

‘Last year we were the club that qualified with the biggest amount of points every time with 15 points. What happened this year in the three games of the Champions League, we have time to arrange it and I am sure we are going to arrange it.

‘It is impossible to be sure but I think this group will be decided in the last game in Italy against Roma. We will see what happens, we are going to try to win our two games at home and see what the other teams do but I am sure this will be decided in the last game.’ 

‘I think it is a very important game but it is not a (sudden) death game because until mathematics can’t fix it, you can continue. We must win this game because we have just two points and we have three games to play and it is very important to have more points. We will consider it not a final game but a very important game.’

City will be without Aleksandar Kolarov and Frank Lampard, Pellegrini confirmed, although Eliaquim Mangala has returned to the squad.

Kolarov picked up a calf injury during the warm-up before last Sunday's Manchester derby, and will be out for around a month.
