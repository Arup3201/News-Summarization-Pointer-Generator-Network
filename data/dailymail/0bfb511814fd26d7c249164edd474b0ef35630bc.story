The U.S. has seen an alarming rise in the number of under 65s needing knee replacements and the UK is expected to follow suit

The number of younger people needing knee replacements is expected to rise because of soaring obesity rates, a study suggests.

An alarming rise in under 65s having the surgery in the U.S. is being blamed on junk food diets and lack of exercise - with fears growing that the UK will follow suit.

Data suggests the phenomenon is happening on both sides of the Atlantic because of the pressure bulging waistlines are putting on the joints.

There are also concerns people's artificial knees will not survive under the strain.

The latest research in the U.S. shows total knee replacements (TKRs) were easily outpacing total hip replacements (THRs) over the past 20 years - coinciding with the obesity epidemic.

Dr Peter Derman, an orthopaedic surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, said: ‘Because excess body weight appears to be more damaging to the knee than to the hip the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity may explain the growing demand for knee replacements over hip replacements.’

In 1993 surgeons performed 1.16 TKRs for every THR - but this ratio grew to 1.6 by 2009, says the study published in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.

Interestingly, patients aged 18 to 64 experienced a more rapid rise in obesity compared to those who were older.

From 1997 to 2009 the share of the younger group undergoing TKR rose 56 per cent compared with only 35 per cent for THR.

Dr Derman said: ‘We observed growth of knee replacement volumes was far outpacing that of hip replacements and were curious as to the origins of this trend.’

Previous studies have found a strong link between a higher BMI (body mass index) and knee osteoarthritis. The effects of weight on hip osteoarthritis were less clear.

So the researchers reviewed at least 10 years of national data up to 2009 on numbers of knee and hip replacements, length of hospital stay, in-hospital mortality and orthopaedic workforce trends.

They found TKRs have far outstripped THRs for patients with a BMI of at least 25 - which is considered overweight - or 30, which is deemed obese. But the same pattern was not seen for those with a BMI of less than 25.

The researchers also looked at whether payment could have played a part which does not seem to be the case.

Fees for TKR in the U.S. fell from about $3,000 a case in 1995 to $1,560 in 2009 and those for THR from $2,840 to $1,460.

The trend is being blamed on soaring obesity rates as heavier people put more pressure on their joints

As this represents an approximate 48 per cent drop in fees for both procedures surgeons do not appear to be performing more TKRs over THRs because of higher reimbursement.

Hospital reimbursement, length of hospital stay and in-hospital mortality pertaining to TKR and THR also comparably declined between 1995 and 2009.

Dr Derman said: ‘We found this differential growth rate in total knee replacement procedures could not be attributed to changes in physician or hospital payments, length of hospital stays, in-hospital death rates or surgical work force characteristics.’

Junk food diets are thought to be responsible for the rising obesity levels which are fuelling the demand for knee replacements

A couple 
of years ago figures for the UK showed an emerging trend of requests for
 knee replacements for arthritic ‘baby boomers’ in their 50s.

A
 report in the journal Arthritis & Rheumatism said work is urgently needed to 
check if giving artificial joints to this age group is wise given the 
product’s unknown life expectancy.

The durability of the replacement knees has only been assessed in patients in their 60s, 70s and 80s - not in their 50s.

Best estimates suggest the joints last for about 15 years in these older and often less physically active recipients.

Dr Derman said: ‘If rates of overweight and obesity continue to climb we should expect further acceleration in the number of knee replacements performed annually in the U.S. with a more modest increase in hip replacement volumes.

‘This knowledge can inform future policy decisions regarding health care funding and surgical workforce training as well as guide allocation of preventative health resources.’

Professor Kay, of the Royal College of Surgeons, said he was not surprised U.S. doctors are blaming an alarming rise in surgery in the under 65s on junk food diets and lack of exercise.

The national clinical director for musculoskeletal services for NHS England said: ‘We are a little bit behind the States - we are not quite as fat yet - but we are getting there.

‘We must get the message across to patients and the public at large to lose weight and get fitter so they do not need knee replacements.

‘It’s easy to say we should be fitter but heart disease, lung disease and cancer can be avoided - and mental health boosted - by improvements in lifestyle.’

He said the total number of knee replacement procedures entered into the National Joint Registry during 2012 was 90,842 - an increase of 7.3 per cent compared with 2011.

Of these, 84,833 were primary cases of which osteoarthritis was blamed for 98 per cent of them.
