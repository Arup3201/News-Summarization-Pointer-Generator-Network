Bringing her daughter home from her latest treatment for breast cancer, Gloria Hunniford dared to hope that she was on the road to recovery at last.

With a whole summer stretching out before them in Cornwall, the TV presenter was excited as she prepared a bedroom and bought her daughter’s favourite foods.

But just eight hours later, Caron Keating was dead. And nine years on from that day, the grief is still overwhelming.

Breaking down in tears as she told Piers Morgan about the moment Miss Keating arrived home for what would be the last time, the 73-year-old said: ‘It seems really odd now for me to look back and think that she was going to make it. Because she made us believe that. Even when she was being driven home, I can remember being so excited. Nervous and excited at the same time.

‘Getting the bed ready and trying to get food that might appeal to her, but thinking to myself, “She’s coming home. And she’s going to be home. She’s going to be in Cornwall, where her house was, and we’ll have her for the whole summer”.’

Miss Keating’s husband Russell Lindsay helped her to change and get into bed and after that Miss Hunniford went in to see her – for what would be the last time.

In the interview to be shown tonight on ITV, Morgan asked Miss Hunniford how long was it after her daughter got home, that she died? The former Songs Of Praise host replied: ‘Eight hours. You can’t believe that, can you? They got into bed and… the only person that Caron would let near her in terms of undressing, was Russell, her husband. And eventually Russ said: “You can come in.” And so I got to kiss her goodnight at that point. And sadly she lost that battle at a quarter past six that evening.’

Miss Keating died in her mother’s arms on April 13, 2004, bringing to an end her seven-year battle. Miss Keating, who followed her mother into broadcasting and hosted Blue Peter, was only 41 when she died and her sons Charlie and Gabriel were ten and seven respectively.

So heartbroken was Miss Hunniford that her son Michael Keating had to remind her that she also had two sons who still needed her.

Mr Keating, who also appears on the ITV show tonight, said: ‘Mum was just in the depths of despair for so long. I remember talking with her one day and she said, “I will never ever laugh or smile again.” I said to her, “You do have two other children, and we need you.”’

Much has been reported over the years about Mr Lindsay’s decision to marry weather girl Sally Meen two years after Miss Keating’s death, and the fact that Miss Hunniford didn’t attend the ceremony.

However, Miss Hunniford told Morgan: ‘Russ and I agreed that it would be very difficult for both of us, after all that we had been through. We’re very close, he’s like a son to me. It wasn’t… that I refused to go to the wedding, it was never on the cards. We had our own private family wedding dinner with Russ, Sally and the children.’

Gloria admitted it was hard to see her son-in-law Russell Lindsay and weather girl Sally Meen (pictured right) marry two years after Caron's death

Meanwhile, Miss Hunniford recalled how she was put on a ‘death list’ by terrorists after making a programme about the Army.

The Co. Armagh native, who worked for the BBC Northern Ireland and the British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS), told Morgan: ‘We used to do a programme for BFBS in Germany, Sean Rafferty and myself. We used to go to meet the Rear Party in Germany. But we were called to the Brigadier’s Home and he said, “By the way, I have to tell you both of you have been placed on a death list”.

‘And we looked at each other and said, “Do you know what, we’ve been doing this now for 11 years, so we might as well just carry on”. So we carried on.’
