Two-thirds of asylum seekers at Manus Island are on hunger strike and up to 14 people have sewn their lips together to protest against a plan to move them to Papua New Guinea. 

Asylum seekers began hunger strikes last week at the Australian-run asylum-seeker processing centre, demanding the immigration department halt a scheduled January 22 transfer of 50 male detainees to temporary, insecure housing in Lorengau, the Manus capital.

Up to 700 people have been refusing to eat and in some cases drink in the protests that have been escalating over the past week, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.

Asylum seekers have also written to Manus Island service providers asking that their organs be donated should they die in detention.

'As you see, hunger strike spreads all over the center and everyday more and more of us become unconsciousness and faint. This means we are entering a critical phase in our medical status,' the letter reads.

'All asylum seekers on Manus Island in hunger strike ask you to hand over our medical records to organ donation organisation in case of our fatalities inside the cage.

'This way at least a part of us may one day feel sweet taste of FREEDOM.'

Immigration Minister Peter Dutton has said the situation was volatile and urged those involved to refrain from self harm.

Refugee advocates said riot officers raided one compound in the early hours of Sunday, seizing ring leaders and placing them in isolation to stop the protest.

But a PNG government spokesman told AAP there was 'no such incident' and that the raid did not happen.

Labor believes the federal government should tell Australians what is going on at the Manus Island detention centre in Papua New Guinea amid conflicting claims about the protest. 

Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul said in a statement that men had to burrow under a perimeter fence to reach bottled water left outside the compound.

But a spokesperson for Mr Dutton said food and water continued to be available to the protesters, and most men at the centre received meals on Sunday.

Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss could not confirm details on Sunday but said Mr Dutton would be seeking to do that.

'The flow of information is not always reliable,' Mr Truss told reporters in Brisbane.

He reiterated the government message that people who arrived by boat without a visa would not be resettled in Australia.

'You won't be able to get your way into this country through some kind of illegal people smuggling operation or by, for that matter, put up an argument that somehow or other you are being badly treated now and therefore should be granted access to this country,' Mr Truss said.

Opposition leader Bill Shorten says Australians are sick and tired of the culture of secrecy surrounding the asylum seeker processing centre there.

'Australians will normally give support to their government on tough matters - if people are told the truth,' Mr Shorten told reporters in Melbourne on Sunday.
