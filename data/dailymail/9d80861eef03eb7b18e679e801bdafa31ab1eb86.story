A failing school has been turned around just 18 months after a new head took over following the sacking of all its governors by Education Secretary Michael Gove.

Downhills Primary was forcibly removed from council control and turned into an academy run by an outside sponsor after years of underperformance.

The school in Haringey, North London, became a focal point of resistance to Mr Gove’s education reforms after union activists bitterly opposed attempts to hand it to an academy operator.

A Save Downhills campaign – fronted by some parents and governors – was backed by the controversial campaign group the Anti Academies Alliance and the National Union of Teachers.

Now Ofsted has reported that the school it became – the Harris Primary Academy Philip Lane – is ‘good’ with ‘outstanding’ leadership.

In their report, inspectors said: ‘Pupils’ progress has improved rapidly since the academy opened in 2012. Leaders have brought about considerable improvements in teaching, behaviour and achievement because of very high expectations.’

It said that since the academy had opened pupils’ progress has accelerated in all year groups. The report noted that pupils’ results were still well below national averages but were improving.

It marks a dramatic turnaround on Downhills’ last full inspection in January 2012 which put the school in special measures – meaning it needed urgent action to turn it round – and heavily criticised leadership and teaching.

Inspectors concluded that ‘the persons responsible for leading, managing or governing the school are not demonstrating the capacity to secure the necessary improvement’.

And they said that ‘teaching over time has failed to provide sufficient levels of challenge for pupils to make adequate progress in reading, writing and mathematics’. Despite the report, campaigners challenged Mr Gove’s attempt to turn the school into an academy through the courts.

The claim was rejected and the school became an academy under the control of the Harris academy chain in September 2012, with its new principal Kirstie Fulthorpe taking up her post in December 2012. A large number of teachers left but only a handful of parents withdrew their children.

Attempts to block the takeover infuriated Mr Gove who branded opponents ‘ideologues who are happy with failure – the enemies of promise’.

‘It’s the bigoted backward bankrupt ideology of a Left-wing establishment that perpetuates division and denies opportunity. And it’s an ideology that’s been proven wrong time and time again,’ he declared.

The latest Ofsted report will be seen as vindication of his insistence the school be taken over.

The Harris chain was founded by the carpets tycoon Lord Harris of Peckham. Its chief executive is Sir Daniel Moynihan who said he was delighted by the academy’s progress. He added: ‘What the critics need to remember is that if a school is failing it means the children are failing and are not secondary-ready, and that cannot be allowed to continue.’

Turnaround: The school in north London, pictured before it was taken over, had been in special measures

The school previously came out of special measures in 2005 but just a few years later was told it required ‘significant improvement’. After it was once again placed in special measures in 2012, Mr Gove ordered the sacking of the governors, to be replaced by an interim board selected by the Department for Education (DfE).

Although the power to remove a governing body had existed for some time, it was never used by the previous Labour government. The DfE said the power was not used lightly. Miss Fulthorpe said her key changes were to improve teaching and communication with parents, including having Somali and Turkish interpreters at parents’ evenings.

She added that the school now has a 20-name waiting list for reception places. A DfE spokesman said: ‘Under local authority control this school had been failing hundreds of pupils for year after year.

‘Such a swift and impressive turnaround proves that partnering with a high-quality academy sponsor is the best way to improve failing schools.’
