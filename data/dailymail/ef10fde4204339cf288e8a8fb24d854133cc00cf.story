Taylor McDonnell, pictured outside court, has been cleared of killing Denis and Joyce Drew, both 86

A young hairdresser who mowed down and killed an elderly couple while on her iPhone at the wheel has been cleared of causing death by dangerous driving.

Taylor McDonnell, 21, was on her way to see her boyfriend when she knocked over and killed Denis and Joyce Drew, both 86, on a poorly-lit road near their home in Ponthir, South Wales.

Now the devastated family of the elderly couple claim 'justice has not been done' after McDonnell was cleared of causing death by dangerous driving while on her iPhone.

The prosecution had alleged that Ms McDonnell had been distracted by her phone but she told the jury at Newport Crown Court that she began her call in a lay-by and switched to hands-free mode. 

She broke down as she told the jury that she only saw 'a flash of colour' before hitting the couple, who were walking arm in arm through through the village on their evening stroll. 

Her trial also heard evidence from road crash expert David Loat, who said that the collision was unavoidable because Mr and Mrs Drew were obscured by a passing car as they crossed the road.

Mr Loat, a former Avon and Somerset Constabulary officer, said: 'It is possible that both views [of Ms McDonnell and the Drews] were obstructed by that car.

'You would have got glare from the headlights... anything behind an approaching vehicle becomes very difficult to see.'  

Newport Crown Court has been told that McDonnell spent 18 minutes of her 20 minute drive making a series of phone calls.

But the hairdresser, who was wearing slippers at the time of the accident, denied making three telephone calls while driving.

McDonnell told the court: 'I was driving and I remember seeing on my driver's side the colour of something.

'Before I could get my mind to function something hit my windscreen and I slammed on my brakes.

'I remember getting out of the car and grabbing my iPhone and asked my Bampi [grandfather] to help me. At first I thought it was an animal because you don't expect it to be a human.'

McDonnell said there was nothing she could have done to avoid the collision after the elderly couple 'came out of nowhere'.

She said: 'I was driving at 30mph and I was looking straight ahead of me. I was driving carefully and responsibly. It was no different to listening to the radio or chatting to a passenger.'

McDonnell said she put her grandfather on speaker phone after talking to him for around eight minutes while pulled over and was still listening to him when the crash occurred.

But  McDonnell could not explain how cell site analysis of her phone showed it moving while engaged in a six minute phone call with her father at the start of her journey.

She also could not account for how she received a text message from her boyfriend in the village where she struck the couple when she had told police she would have been pulled over miles further back while stationary and speaking on the phone to her grandmother when it arrived.

McDonnell was accused of being distracted whilst using her iPhone behind the wheel, but she claimed that she had started her call while stationary and switched to hands-free mode before driving

Prosecutor Lucy Crowther said: 'She was grossly distracted by her telephone.

'She wasn't paying proper attention to her driving - which ultimately caused the deaths of two elderly people - because a telephone call was far more important.'

Retired RAF airman Denis and teacher Joyce met on a blind date and were married for 54 years before the tragedy on November 13, 2013.

Mrs Drew died of her 'massive injuries' in the Royal Gwent Hospital just a few hours after the collision.

Mr Drew was too weak to undergo surgery to treat the multiple fractures, lacerations and deep bruising he suffered, and he died in the same hospital six days later. 

McDonnell broke down as the verdict was read in court today, however, the family of the Drews say they are 'devastated' with the not guilty verdict and are calling on drivers to not drive and use their phones

McDonnell, of Caerwent, Monmouthshire, was cleared of causing death by dangerous driving and a lesser charge of causing death by careless driving, after a jury took eight hours of deliberation.

She broke down in tears as the verdict came in and later refused to speak to reporters as she walked free from court and tried to hide her face from photographers as she left.

The Drews daughter, Sarah England, said her family was 'shocked' and devastated by the not guilty verdict.

Speaking on the steps of Newport Crown Court, she said: 'We are utterly devastated. We are shocked by the not guilty verdict.

'For our beloved parents we feel that justice has not been done. We will never come to terms as to why these gentle souls lost their lives in such a brutal and violent way.

A tearful Mrs England, who was flanked by sister Helen Adam, added that her family wanted the use of mobile phones when driving, even on hands-free, to be as unacceptable as drink-driving.

'The only possible good that comes come out of this is to change the universal acceptance of the use of mobile phones while driving.

'We would like public opinion to think of this in the same way as drink driving. Mobile phones - whether hands free or not - means that people are not in control of the car.

'Sanctions should be considerably higher and more strictly enforced. For our family this is a wholly unacceptable outcome.'
