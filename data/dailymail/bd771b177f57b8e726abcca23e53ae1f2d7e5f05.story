Swansea left back Neil Taylor fears he will be sold in the summer after failing to agree a new contract at the Liberty Stadium.

The Wales international has just over a year left on his existing desk with Garry Monk’s side and is being monitored by a number of clubs in the top half of the Barclays Premier League.

Taylor, 26, has held talks with Swansea about a new deal, but they have yet to agree terms for the former Wrexham defender.

Swansea turned down a number of bids for the left-back in the winter transfer window, but his future will be on the agenda again at the end of the season.

Taylor, who has made 29 appearances for Swansea in the Premier League this season, has been one of the club’s most consistent players.
