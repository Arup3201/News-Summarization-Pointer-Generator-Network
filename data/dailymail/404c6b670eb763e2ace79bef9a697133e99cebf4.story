A Chinese woman had enough of her son-in-law's constant excuses for not paying back his loan, so took to extreme measures to force his hand.

Wang Qin, hired a crane to lift her son-in-law's car onto her house terrace to ensure that he returned the money he had borrowed from her.

Mrs Wang, from Lishui, Zhejiang Province, had been keeping the car as collateral, but turned up the heat when she got tired of waiting.
