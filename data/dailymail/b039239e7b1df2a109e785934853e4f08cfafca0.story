Desperate house-hunters will be out in their thousands this weekend, hopeful of snagging their little piece of Australia, in what some property analysts predict could be the biggest Spring auction clear-out in many years.

The auction boom comes after a recent flattening of the market in the country's major cities.

SQM Research analyst Louis Christopher says this weekend is shaping as 'the crescendo of the season, with very large auction numbers'.

Mr Christopher said that while many pundits were calling the east coast's market being over priced,  there are hidden gems to be found because of the real estate market's 'distressed properties'.

A 27th floor luxury two-bedroom apartment in Surfers Paradise is a prime example of bargains to be had in 'distressed properties sales'

An overseas owner is wanting to divest from the Enderley Avenue apartment in Surfers Paradise and the price is listed at $549,000

He says there will be frantic buying this weekend.

'There are a massive 1750 auctions in Melbourne this weekend, 180 auctions in Brisbane and about 950 auctions in Sydney,' Mr Christopher told Daily Mail Australia.

'These are huge numbers and are up massively from the same weekend last year. In Melbourne, for instance, this time last year there was 1050 auctions.'

In an often overheating Australian property market - Mr Christopher says there are prime pieces of real estate which are going for a song as owners are forced into quick sales. And the hot spot for such sales is undoubtedly south-east Queensland.

He nominated a 27th floor luxury two-bedroom apartment in Surfers Paradise as a prime example. With an overseas owner needing to divest, it is one of the real estate market's 'distressed properties' and listed for just $549,000.

'This one has massive price reduction, our records show it was last sold for $775,000 in April of 2007 and now it's on the market for $549,000,' he said. 

A short walk away in Surfers is another bargain.

This one boasts two bedrooms and two bathrooms and has ocean views and is up for just $395,000.

Thousands of properties around Australia are selling under distressed conditions, which occur for a variety of reasons, from a divorce demanding sale to a mortgagee being in possession or a quick sale needed ahead of overseas posting.

Agents say that 'this 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom apartment in the Moroccan is fully furnished with a large balcony with great ocean views and in a fantastic location'

The two-bedder apartment in the Moroccan is listed for quick sale at $395,000

Despite the ultra-competitive property market SQM research analysts say there are plenty of bargains to be had in prime Australian real estate at the moment. 

Earlier this year SQM Research group launched its regular report of the best available properties.

It breaks down where you can find the bargains, what their price history is and the cost expectation and the reasons why it is being sold quickly.

'There are thousands of property owners literally begging for a buyer because of their situation having changed,' said Mr Christopher.

Sydney's eastern suburbs is not renowned for being a place in which to bag a bargain but he pinpointed a two bedroom apartment, just a short walk from Maroubra beach, having to be sold quickly through the 'mortgagee exercising power of sale'. It last sold for $513,000 in 2003 but is expected to go for a lot less than valuations of more than $700,000. The average price for apartments in that area is $650,000.

'Straight out mortgage in possession it (the Maroubra apartment) last sold for $513,000 in 2003,' said Louis Christopher. It's been valued at more than $700,000 but could go for much less

'There are thousands of property owners literally begging for a buyer because of their situation having changed,' said Mr Christopher.

While there are many who will be searching for their dream home this weekend at an affordable price, there are those for whom money is no object.
