Islamic State militants fighting in Kobane have released a slick Call of Duty-style video produced using aerial footage taken from a drone and shots of soldiers rampaging through the besieged Syrian city that appear to have been filmed on state of the art helmet-mounted cameras.

The four-minute video appears to show the  militants engaged in fierce gun battles with Kurdish resistance forces, who have bravely battled ISIS since their terrorists first attack there September.

The footage also features a number of cut away segments showing massive explosions inside Kobane, which video captions claim show ISIS fighters carrying out suicide bomb attacks.

The video was released on December 9 through one of ISIS' many YouTube channels and has since been repeatedly shared by militants and their sympathisers on Twitter and Facebook. 

It begins by showing jihadis charging through the battered streets of Kobane brandishing large assault rifles, which are fired indiscriminately at targets around the city.

The footage - which seems to have been shot on a helmet camera - is clearly dubbed to include the additional sound of gunfire, with each scene cleverly edited to make it appear as if the terrorists are characters in a video game.

The clip then cuts to the same kind of high-quality aerial shots of Kobane that were previously seen at the start of a recent ISIS propaganda video featuring the British hostage John Cantlie.

Rampaging: The video, which has not been independently verified, was released by an Aleppo-based branch of ISIS' propaganda wing

Filmed using a drone - a type of unmanned aircraft - the film shows the rubble-strewn streets and surrounding desert of Kobane, which lies just a few yards south of the Syrian border with Turkey.

At several points the camera freezes and a caption pops up identifying each location where an ISIS suicide bombing allegedly took place. A few seconds of footage showing the explosion then appear, before the drone continues its journey to the next attack site. 

The video, which has not been independently verified, was released by an Aleppo-based branch of ISIS' propaganda wing. 

Usually such films are put out by the better known Al-Hayat Media Centre, which has become infamous for creating the terror group's sickening videos showing the beheading of Westerners, including Britons David Haines and Alan Henning.

Kobane has been under attack from ISIS militants since mid-September, when the terror group assaulted its southern suburbs in an attempt to seize control of the strategic border city.

The terror group quickly encircled the city, raping and murdering its inhabitants, but brave Kurdish YPG fighters supported by U.S. airstrikes have since pushed ISIS back out of central Kobane.

Yesterday the U.S. confirmed it had launched a further 20 airstrikes against ISIS targets, including raids near Sinjar, Qaim, Ramadi, Mosul and Samarra, as well as inside Kobane.

Smoke rises in Kobane after American warplanes carry out an attack on an Islamic State-held building

Earlier this week Brett McGurk, deputy special presidential envoy to the coalition to counter ISIS, told the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee that America and partner nations have conducted more than 500 airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria - the vast majority of them in Kobane.

'As of today, that assault has failed and has resulted in nearly 1,000 ISIL fighters killed, including many leaders,' he said, using an alternative acronym for the terror group.

However Republicans and Democrats complained that the White House's response to ISIS has been lackluster, with Rep. Ed Royce, the committee chairman, saying Washington is 'still dithering.' 

Royce said ISIS still controls essentially the same amount of territory it did in the summer and U.S.-backed groups in Syria still do not have the support they need to fight the extremists - and defend themselves from bombs dropped by Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces.

Islamic State terrorists fighting in Iraq have released a video showing jihadis posing with a drone that was shot down near the city of Kirkuk.

The three-minute video begins by showing a Elbit Skylark drone crashed in a grassy area having crash landed in an area under the control of ISIS militants.

It then shows the terrorists waiting several hours before going to recover the drone - suggesting they were in an area of Kirkuk close to the frontline with the Iraqi army, who they feared may attack them attempted to perform the recovery without the cover of darkness.

Having recovered the drone, the terrorists then take it into a covered room, where it is proudly displayed in front of ISIS' chilling black banner.

Close-up shots reveal the drone to have markings and instructions written in English, suggesting it is likely to have been either an American military drone, or one provided to the Iraqi army by the United States, who expensively trained and largely equipped the domestic security forces.

Skylark drones, developed by Elbit Systems, are miniature unmanned aerial vehicles designed  for tactical surveillance and reconnaissance missions.

During operation, it sends real-time video to a portable ground station.

The reason the drone appears largely intact despite having apparently crash-landed is because it contains a small inflatable cushion that reduces damage in the event of a ground impact.

As the Skylark can cover a distance of up to 25 miles in a single journey, it has widely been used for surveillance in war zones, including in both Afghanistan and Iraq,

Countries known to still be using this particular model of drone include France, Australia, Canada and Israel.
