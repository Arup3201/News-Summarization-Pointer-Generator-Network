Prosecutors have come under fire after a leading Crown lawyer suggested the £100million hacking trial was necessary to ‘explore the culture of invading privacy’.

Greg McGill, a senior lawyer in the Crown Prosecution Service, tried to justify the cost of the case at the Old Bailey by saying it wasn’t about phone hacking but about a need to probe privacy breaches.

But critics pointed out that the Leveson Inquiry into Press standards had already addressed the issue.

A stream of celebrities poured into the Royal Courts of Justice two years ago to talk about alleged wrongdoing by the sections of the Press and to call for tighter regulations.

Critics also said that during the eight-month phone-hacking trial – which finished with just one conviction this week – it emerged that friends, family and even celebrities themselves happily sold stories to the News of the World for money, influence or to prolong their own time in the headlines.

Despite this, Mr McGill insisted: ‘This case was not about whether phone hacking took place or whether public officials were paid for information; there are a significant number of recent convictions which show that both did happen.

‘This has been a lengthy and complex trial which was required to explore a culture of invading privacy.’ Privacy experts said a criminal trial was not the appropriate forum to explore such issues.

Niri Shan, head of media law at Taylor Wessing, said: ‘A criminal trial is not really the forum to explore the issue of the invasion of privacy. We have already had the Leveson inquiry to do that and there have been a large number of civil actions going through the courts that have also fulfilled that role.’

It came as former News of the World managing editor Stuart Kuttner, one of five people acquitted this week, claimed he was ‘stitched up’ and that the press was unfairly targeted by police and prosecutors.

In an interview with Channel 4 News, Mr Kuttner, who worked at the tabloid from 1980 until 2009, said he and his co-accused had been ‘rounded up’ as part of an ‘assault’ on the Press.

‘I’ve lived with this frankly hideous nightmare for three years. There was no substance to it,’ he said.

‘But I was obviously part of a group who were to be rounded up. I think the State, through its legal arms – the Crown Prosecution Service, the Metropolitan Police Force – chose to take on the Press.’

Mr Kuttner was cleared of being part of the hacking conspiracy dating back to 2000.

He added: ‘I resent it for my colleagues, and I am inclined to use the term stitch-up, because that’s what I believe it was. And what lies behind it was an absolute unmerited assault on a free Press.’
