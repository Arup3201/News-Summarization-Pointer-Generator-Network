We've all faced the dilemma when preparing for a flight. How much hand luggage can we get away with taking on board.

If your airline is Ryanair, it seems, you’d better be extra careful.

A female passenger who fell foul of 
their regulations was marched off a jet by police officers moments 
before take-off, it has been claimed.

Video posted online showing a Spanish 
Guardia Civil officer ejecting the woman from the aircraft at Valencia 
airport has caused outrage.

Excess baggage: Video footage posted on Facebook shows the woman with her hand luggage moments before take-off on a Ryanair flight from Valencia

Pleas: The woman was filmed arguing with a Spanish police officer, who had been called on board by cabin crew to eject her

Off you go: After a minute or more of argument, the woman is forced off the flight. She claimed her credit card wasn't working and so she couldn't pay a £40 excess baggage fee

Spanish newspapers said she was judged
 to have broken the airline’s rule of boarding with only a small package
 because as she was carrying a scroll, which would not fit in her case, 
and a book.

Footage shows the Spanish woman begging to be let on board.

Passengers are heard asking how they can help and if they can place the item in their suitcases for her.

They can be heard shouting ‘shameful, 
shameful’ at the officer as the woman is led off the plane.  

The video 
was posted on Facebook by a user called Soraya Pla, who said the woman 
shouted out as she entered the cabin that she had tried to pay an 
oversized luggage fee with her credit card, but it had not been working.

She added: ‘Look at what we have just 
witnessed on a Ryanair flight, I am crying with impotence. They took her
 forcefully, because of a simple book and a scroll that did not fit in 
her bag.’

The clip has spread across the internet and led to calls from Spanish Twitter users to boycott the airline.

Strict regulations: Ryanair prevents its passengers from carrying more than a small package on board as hand luggage

Ryanair rules state only one item of 
hand luggage, with maximum dimensions of 55cm by 40cm by 20cm and 
weighing up to 10kg, is allowed per person. Oversized baggage will be 
refused at the boarding gate or subject to a £50 fee and placed in the 
hold.

The airline defended its actions, 
claiming the woman had become disruptive and ‘pushed past its gate 
agents without showing any ID or her boarding card’.

A spokesman said: ‘This passenger was 
in breach of airport security regulations, and having become disruptive 
was properly removed from the aircraft at the request of Ryanair 
agents.’

Ryanair chief executive Michael 
O’Leary was at the centre of a storm in September when he described 
passengers who forgot to print their boarding passes as ‘stupid’.

Passenger Suzy McLeod was charged £236 to print out five boarding passes before a flight from Alicante to Bristol.

She claimed she had already checked in
 online but hadn’t printed out the boarding cards at home. But Mr 
O’Leary  responded: ‘We think Mrs McLeod should pay 60 euros for being 
so stupid.’

He is famously outspoken, once saying 
about customer service: ‘People say the customer is always right, but 
you know what – they’re not. Sometimes they are wrong and they need to 
be told so.’

Ryanair has courted controversy in the
 past with plans to sell standing only tickets for flights, charge 
passengers to use the lavatory and install bunks in aircraft hulls.
