For more than a decade her identity has been a mystery.

But new technology could mean that 'Jane Doe', a woman who was found burned and beaten to death, would finally be identified.

Forensic investigators have exhumed the body of the unidentified murder victim, who was discovered in a Milwaukee cornfield in July 1999.

Using state-of-the-art technology, researchers could find out vital information about her life in the months and even years leading to her death, the Milwaukee Winsconsin Journal Sentinel said.

Her body has been transferred to the Milwaukee County medical examiner's office, where tests will be carried out.

This could lead to authorities finally tracking down those behind her brutal death, the Journal Times reported.

In December the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children released an updated photo of the victim, but police have still not been able to identify her and no relatives have come forward.

'Anytime you cannot identify a victim your back is literally against a wall,' Racine County Sheriff Christopher Schmaling said in December.

'This is someone's loved one. It's important for us to provide closure to that family. We don't even know who she is at this point.'

'We determined with our forensic artist to do another rendering of a composite to try to make it as accurate as possible to how this child would've appeared,' said Bob Hoever of the Center for Missing and Exploited Children.

Jane Doe was 5ft 8ins tall and weighed 120 pounds.

She had reddish brown, collar-length curly hair with highlights and most likely had brown eyes.

She had double pierced ears and her left ear had a deformation consistent with 'cauliflower ear'.

Her teeth were in poor condition, with her front teeth slightly protruding.

She was found wearing black sweatpants and a man's grey country western-style shirt.  

The shirt had pearlized popper buttons and a red floral pattern.
