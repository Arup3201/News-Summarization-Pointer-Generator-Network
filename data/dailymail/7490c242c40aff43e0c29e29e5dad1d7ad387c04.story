Elizabeth Hurley said hardly anything was written about breast cancer when her grandmother died of the disease in 1992

Elizabeth Hurley has described her anger at being unable to help her grandmother battle breast cancer.

The actress said her grandmother showed her scars from a double mastectomy but then quickly changed the subject.

In 1992, she passed away from the disease.

Now, Ms Hurley says speaking honestly and openly about the disease could help save women like her grandmother.

She told Sky News this morning: 'My grandmother didn’t really speak about it at all, when she found her lump she was too scared to tell the doctor, she didn’t know anything about breast cancer.

'She assumed it was a death sentence, and unfortunately it was for her.’

Later, appearing on ITV’s This Morning, she called the time when her grandmother was diagnosed the 'dark ages' of breast cancer, as it was still a taboo subject.

She said: ‘They were talking about how at that time, there was no pink ribbon, nobody talked about breast cancer, magazines didn’t have pink months, nobody was selling products to raise money for research.’

This month she jetted to the U.S. and Canada carrying out her role as a global ambassador for the Estee Lauder Companies' Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign.

The campaign urges women diagnosed with breast cancer to tell their stories.

The people who have cared for a loved one with breast cancer are also encouraged to share their experiences.

Ms Hurley said: ‘When a trauma comes into someone’s life, it’s not only the person that’s diagnosed, it’s the caretakers - the people that are with them -  whose lives are spiralled into a horror scenario when they help their loved one get through this challenging time.'

In an interview with The Times, she said she was angry a lack of awareness meant she didn’t have more time with her grandmother before she died.

She said: 'At that time, there was so little written about breast cancer.

'It wasn't until I started to learn about breast cancer through Evelyn Lauder that I began to feel so angry that I hadn't known more at the time, when perhaps I could have helped her.

'We know that if a cancer is found and treated early, there is a 95 per cent chance of recovery. 

'If only my grandmother and countless other scared women could have known this.'

Ms Hurley was speaking at the start of Breast Cancer Awareness Month.

Last week the star lit up the Empire State Building in New York as part of the company's We're Stronger Together campaign.

The Eiffel Tower in Paris, The Colosseum in Rome, The Bandra-Worli Sea Link in Mumbai, The Burj Al Arab in Dubai and The Peninsula in Hong Kong are all due to be lit up in pink over the coming weeks.

Earlier this year Ms Hurley posted a picture of herself on Twitter after undergoing a mammogram check.

She said: 'After 40 you should have an annual mammogram. Had mine this morning.'

Ms Hurley's awareness campaign comes as television presenter Michaela Strachan revealed she was diagnosed with the disease.

The Springwatch host said she was forced to have both breasts removed after the cancer was discovered in a mammogram at the start of the year.

She told the Mail on Sunday's You magazine: 'The tears started to roll as my doctor tried to tell me what would happen next, but I only took in every fifth word or so.

'The one word that registered was "cancer".'

 Medics advised her to have a double mastectomy.

The star said: 'I couldn't get my head around the fact that on Monday morning I'd been apparently healthy, by Tuesday I had cancer, and by Wednesday I was talking about a double mastectomy.'

The 48-year-old, who is set to undergo reconstructive surgery, stressed her experience showed the importance of regular check-ups.

'If I'd put mine off, my story could have been a very different one,' she said.

Last year, actress Angelina Jolie revealed to the world that she had undergone a double mastectomy to prevent her getting breast cancer.

She took the decision after testing positive for the BRCA1 gene mutation that greatly increases the risk of developing the disease.
