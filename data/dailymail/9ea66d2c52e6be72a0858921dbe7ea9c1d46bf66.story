Oliver had no idea what was happening when he began shaking and vomiting at sixth form college just over a year ago

A teenager who thought he felt sick due to a hangover was actually suffering a stroke that almost killed him.

Last year Oliver Lilburn started shaking uncontrollably in front of his friends at his sixth form college in Ipswich before he was violently sick and blacked out.

He was rushed to hospital where doctors told his parents Justine and Colin he had suffered a brain haemorrhage leading to the stroke and they should prepare to say their final farewells.

But Oliver, now 19, clung to life and now after a tough year of rehab he wants to raise awareness about the illness.

Oliver, of Dedham, north Essex, said: 'To be honest, I still haven't really comes to terms with the whole thing.

'I thought I was just hungover. But my vision was blurry and then later in the day my whole right side started shaking. Then I vomited on the way to hospital and passed out.'

The teenager had just returned from a six-week charity project in Africa when he was hit by the bolt out of the blue.

'The doctors told mum and dad to fear the worst and say their last goodbyes to me,' he said.

'It was touch and go for a while.'

The following day Oliver was transferred from Ipswich Hospital to the intensive care unit at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge.

His close friend Florence Irvine, 19, of Felixstowe, Suffolk, said: 'We went up the morning after it happened - it was horrible.

'He's usually so energetic and fun and he just looked so fragile.

'Oliver could tell we were there and would grab our hands but that was all we were getting from him.'

The devastating stroke left Oliver without any movement on his right side and badly affected his speech.

Following weeks of intensive treatment in hospital, he is well on the way to making a full recovery, apart from having slightly slurred speech. 

'Part of my rehab is going to the gym 
and I'm lucky to always go with my dad, brother, cousin, or a close 
friend during the week,' he said. 

He wants to raise money for the charity Different Strokes for young stroke survivors who don't have the same amount of support as he did.

Stroke is the single largest cause of disability in the UK. Around 150,000 people suffer a stroke every year and a quarter of these are under the age of 65.

Oliver is now preparing to go to university after he had to postpone going away last year.
