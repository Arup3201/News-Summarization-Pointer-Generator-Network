Wal-Mart Stores Inc and Facebook unveiled a partnership on Tuesday to help the world's largest retailer connect customers with its local stores.

Wal-Mart launched My Local Walmart, a page that lets the retailer's roughly nine million Facebook fans follow what is happening at stores in their neighborhoods.

The effort covers about 3,500 Wal-Mart outlets and will send alerts to the company's Facebook fans about new products and discounts, the companies said.

'With early Walmarts, customers would walk in and ask the store manager to get a product,' said Stephen Quinn, chief marketing officer of Wal-Mart.

'This is going to allow this kind of communication at national scale. Stores become more relevant on a local level because of interaction with customers.'

Wal-Mart is stepping up investments in both e-commerce and social networking to try to compete more effectively with Internet rivals led by Amazon.com.

Facebook fans of Wal-Mart who sign up to the new page will get about two messages a week from their local store at first, Quinn added.

Alerts may be triggered by local events such as a high school football game or weather, he said.

'A national message is sometimes not relevant,' Quinn said. 'We can now say we have sunscreen in the south and snow boots in the north.'

My Local Walmart also will have a role in this year's holiday shopping season, especially on the day after Thanksgiving when shoppers line up early for deals, he added.

Half of adults on Facebook currently follow a brand as part of their profile. WalMart has well over 9million followers

Shoppers will be able to download maps of their local store from My Local Walmart, showing them where specific merchandise will be in their store.

'It's impossible to put out a generic map,' Quinn said. 'This allows us to put out store maps for each local store.'  

WalMart hopes the push will help them compete with Amazon, run by CEO Jeff Bezos, this holiday season

The venture comes at a time when Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, is trying to reverse nine straight quarters of revenue declines at U.S. stores open at least a year -- a key measure of a retailer's health.

Carolyn Everson, vice president of global marketing solutions for Facebook.com, said the partnership with Wal-Mart goes beyond a 'simple local tab.'

'This is embedding the social media phenomenon into the core of the offering,' she added. She noted that Wal-Mart has worked hard to engage its Facebook fans.

Facebook isn't currently working with other merchants to develop this localized approach because it doesn't have enough resources, she added.

 In April 2010, Facebook allowed brands and retailers to use the now ubiquitous 'like' button on their websites, making it easier to share and connect with friends.

Everson noted that brands are starting to see a measurable sales impact on products that are 'liked' on Facebook

More than 50 percent of active adults on Facebook follow a brand.

To get local information from their store, Wal-Mart customers can click on to www.facebook/Walmart and then will be able to 'like' stores that are nearest to them.
