From an old-fashioned barbers, quaint bakery and traditional Irish pub - the town of Bushmills is the picture of a thriving community.

But for the recession-hit Northern Irish town, the appearance of prosperity comes from a creative scheme that rejuvenates boarded up windows and doors with colourful paintings.

The Brighter Bushmills Project aims to use graphics and artwork to encourage tourists to visit the town where Bushmills whiskey was distilled for the first time.

Putting on a front: This remarkable painting of a greengrocer with a bounty of produce on show is just one of the scenes that are brightening up Bushmills

Where past meets present: The old-fashioned shop fronts, such as this barbers look striking in the town, which has been badly hit by the recession

Sweet touch: A boarded-up window is made to look like the front of a bakery. The scheme aims to attract more tourists to Bushmills

Window shopping: From strange scene like this headless man (left) to an image of a traditional Irish pub, artists Helene Byrne and Louie Winward have made the town's main street vibrant and interesting

The project has given around a dozen vacant units a facelift. Broken windows and unused doors have been covered with scenes of buzzing businesses.

Hundreds of thousands of visitors pass through the town of Bushmills to reach one of Northern Ireland's biggest attractions- the Giant's Causeway.

Now, the village is becoming recognisable for highly detailed artwork and graphics that brighten up its main street.

Director of environmental services for the local 
council, Aidan McPeake said: 'Being a tourist village, there was 
quite a lot of emphasis put on trying to bring about an uplift and see 
could it be the catalyst for further economic development in the town.

Appealing: Two of the shops that were given a full facelift are now no longer occupied, which is testament to the project's success

View from the top deck: When fake shop fronts can't be erected, portraits of farmers have been put up to look down on the town

Location: Tourists pass through the village to reach one of Northern Ireland's biggest attractions- the Giant's Causeway

Notable: The town, on the Northern Ireland's Causeway Coast is home to Bushmills whiskey

'That seems to be the case now, the village has been very popular this year. It's been very successful.

'Two of the shops brightened up with art over the past year are no longer vacant.

'Obviously
locals would much rather see the properties filled and in use all the 
time but this is definitely the next best option,' McPeake said.

Artists Helene Byrne and Louie Winward have painted 
windows and doors on to empty houses, with farmyard animals emerging from the shops.

Spooky: Some of the paintings, such as the scary faces in these windows have a gothic look

Green, green grass of home: The Northern Irish government has spent £2million to tackle dereliction over the past two years. This artwork is fixed to a hoarding around a building site

Points of interest: Farmyard animals (left) are a recurring theme in the town's paintings. Some of the windows have been painted with detailed items (right)

Smarten up: The image of sharp suits in this painting reflects the project's aim to make Bushmills more appealing

Walk on by: A painted pheasant looks out on Bushmill's busy main street

The scheme was set up by locals and supported by the council. The local distillery contributed to the fundraising effort.

£30,000 were raised for the first stage of the project and the second phase was carried out using government funds.

The Northern Ireland government has spent £2 million pounds to tackle dereliction over the past two years and stickers were applied to windows in areas near the luxury golf resort where G8 leaders met to give the impression that business was booming.

Sense of humour: From 'A cut above the rest' to 'Mutton Chops'- the artist responsible for the new barber's shop had fun with the quirky concept

Juxtaposition: A woman carried polystyrene takeaway containers past a mural of a wholesome farmer's market

Thumbs up: These teenagers give the seal of approval to the town's innovative scheme
