AFL great Gavin Wanganeen has broken down after receiving back his premiership jersey, 10 years after it was stolen from his bag after the grand final.

Wanganeen helped the Port Adelaide Football Club to victory in the 2004 grand final - the first for the club - kicking four goals.

The last time he saw the guernsey he had been wearing during the final was when he removed it in the change room before taking a shower.

The Port Adelaide Football Club launched a campaign to find Gavin Wanganeen's premiership guernsey which was stolen from his bag after the 2004 final

He believes it was stolen from his bag and Wanganeen has not seen the jersey since.

Wanganeen retired in 2006 but has remained connected to the club as a mentor and Aboriginal program ambassador and the club launched a campaign to find his grand final jumper in time for the tenth anniversary of the premiership win.

The club received an anonymous tip-off from someone claiming to have the jersey who said he would return it after the Adelaide Power's Round 17 match against Richmond on July 13.

After the match assistant coach Josh Carr collected the guernsey from the person, who wished to remain anonymous and did not say how they came to possess it.

In order to surprise Wanganeen, the club organised for him to speak to the club's current playing group. After his presentation, Kane Cornes, one of Wanganeen's 2004 premiership teammates presented him with jersey.

The last time Wanganeen saw his grand final jumper was when he took it off to take a shower after the grand final in 2004

Wanganeen was shocked to see his football jumper again, saying: 'Are you serious? Is this the real deal? Bull***t!'

'It's an amazing feeling to be able to get this jumper back,' said an emotional Wanganeen.

'I haven't seen it in 10 years since I last took it off after the grand final and jumped into the shower. I remember putting into my bag â€“ that was the last time I saw it until 10 minutes ago when I was lucky enough to lay my eyes on it again.

'It's an amazing feeling, I'd pretty much given up and was resigned to the fact that I'd never see it again,' he said.

Wanganeen said he was delighted the jersey would be able to stay in the family.

'I'll be able to hand it down to my son, Tex,' he said.

'I can get it framed now, put it on the wall somewhere and regularly look at it and be reminded of that great day in 2004 when our great Port Adelaide footy club won our first premiership in the AFL.'
