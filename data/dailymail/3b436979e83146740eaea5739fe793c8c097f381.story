Javier Hernandez, David de Gea and Juan Mata have all been enjoying Manchester United's new signing Ander Herrera's birthday.

The Spaniard turned 25 on Wednesday and  team-mate Javier Hernandez posted a snap on Instagram of the foursome with a message in Spanish wishing the midfielder a happy birthday.

Hernandez could be moving to Juventus as part of the deal for Chilean midfielder Arturo Vidal, but he looked happy as Larry as he smiled with his fellow Red Devils, and Herrera looked similarly delighted.

In the driving seat: Juan Mata was happy to drive his fellow Spaniard around on his birthday 

Juan Mata meanwhile posted a snap on Twitter of him driving his compatriot, with the caption 'Happy birthday @anderherrera8!! I'm his driver, it is his day, Enjoy!'

Herrera has so far impressed since joining United and his presence in the side will be especially important with Michael Carrick out injured until October.

The Spanish central midfielder is expected to pull the strings in midfield in United's Premier League opener against Swansea on Saturday.

Pulling the strings: Herrera is an excellent passer and will set the tempo of Manchester United's play

Strong in the tackle: Herrera puts himself about in the pre-season clash against Liverpool 

Commanding: De Gea has improved hugely over the last few years and become an imposing goalkeeper 

Playmaker: Mata will try to recapture the form that made him one of the best players in the Premier League

Staying or going: Javier Hernandez could be on his way out of Old Trafford this summer
