The hotel maid who claims she was attacked by Dominique Strauss-Kahn has given her account of how the naked ex-IMF chief tore off her underwear and wrestled her to the floor.

Fighting back tears, Nafissatou Diallo said he carried out a violent sexual assault ‘like a crazy man’.

The 32-year-old immigrant from  Guinea waived her right to anonymity  as her lawyers revealed they will be launching a civil lawsuit against  Strauss-Kahn. It is likely to include a  claim for damages that could run into millions of dollars.

Emotional: The hotel maid breaks down as she explains why she has decided to come forward

The criminal case against him is 
widely expected to be dismissed after serious questions were raised over
Miss Diallo’s credibility. He strenuously denies all  the allegations.

But in interviews with the U.S. media the mother of one said: ‘I want justice. I want him to go to jail.

‘I want him to know that there are 
some places you cannot use your money, you cannot use your power when 
you do something like this.’

Miss Diallo said she was working at 
the Sofitel Hotel in Manhattan on May 14 when she went to clean 
presidential suite 2806 where Strauss-Kahn was staying.

She said she went into the living 
room and was facing the bedroom when the naked 62-year-old appeared. ‘Oh
my God, I’m so sorry,’ she said, to which he allegedly replied: ‘You 
don’t have to  be sorry.’

The Frenchman then started behaving 
like a ‘crazy man’, she claimed, and grabbed her breasts before slamming
the door to the suite.

He allegedly told her: ‘You’re 
beautiful’ as he began to wrestle her towards the bedroom, but she 
pleaded with him and said: ‘Sir, stop this. I don’t want to lose my 
job.’

She claimed Strauss-Kahn assured her: ‘You’re not going to lose your job.’

Miss Diallo said she was ‘so afraid’ 
and could not even look at him as he ‘pulled her hard on to the bed’ and
tried to force her to perform a sex act on him, which she resisted.

‘I push him. I get up. I wanted to 
scare him. I said, “Look, there is my supervisor right there”.’ 
Strauss-Kahn allegedly said no one was there to hear.

According to the maid’s account, she 
carried on trying to push him away, but Strauss-Kahn shoved her back 
down the hall before pulling her uniform down and tearing her underwear.

She claims he pushed her on to her knees with her back to the wall and forced her to perform a sex act.

Afterwards, she said, she got up and 
fled. ‘I run out of there. I don’t turn back. I run to the hallway. I 
was so nervous, I was so scared. I didn’t want to lose my job,’ she 
said.

Miss Diallo claimed in the interviews
with ABC News and Newsweek magazine that it was only later, when she 
was watching TV, that she realised her alleged attacker was the head of 
the International Monetary Fund, a position he was forced to quit over 
her allegations.

‘I was watching the news and they 
said he was going to be the next president of France. I said, “Oh my 
God, they’re going to kill me, I’m going to die”. If that was in my 
country and a powerful man like that, they’re going to kill me.’

Prosecutors have admitted the case 
against Strauss-Kahn has been ‘weakened’ because of issues with Miss 
Diallo, including the fact that she lied on her asylum application to 
the U.S.

She has also been accused of having Aids and of being a prostitute.

With tears streaming down her face, 
she said: ‘I’m not and I’ve never been called that. God is my witness 
I’m telling the truth. From my heart. God knows that. And he 
[Strauss-Kahn] knows that.’

Strauss-Kahn is accused of six  charges including attempted rape and sexual abuse, to which he has pleaded not guilty.

However stringent bail conditions 
have been lifted and he is free to move around the United States ahead 
of a court hearing scheduled for Monday.

A civil case would involve a lower 
standard of proof so is more likely to be a success. For example 
O J Simpson was acquitted over the death of his ex-wife Nicole but later
lost a civil case brought by her family.

New York lawyer Dan Bright, who  is 
representing Naomi Campbell’s  former manager in a lawsuit against the 
model, said: ‘Strauss-Kahn is wealthy enough that he might settle 
rather  than go through the embarrassment of a civil trial.

‘The amount of damages claimed could potentially be huge.’

Strauss-Kahn’s lawyers William Taylor
and Ben Brafman said Miss Diallo’s interviews, for which she was not 
paid, were a ‘circus’.

‘The obvious purpose is to inflame public opinion against a defendant in a pending criminal case,’ they said.

But Miss Diallo’s lawyer Kenneth 
Thompson said: ‘There’s no mystery. There’s no hiding the fact. This man
attempted to rape her.’

Strauss-Kahn also faces charges in 
Paris that he tried to rape French journalist Tristane Banon during a 
2003 interview in her flat.
