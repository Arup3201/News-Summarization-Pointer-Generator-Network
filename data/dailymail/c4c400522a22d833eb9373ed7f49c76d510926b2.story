The best gift Liz and Mario Shlimon received on their wedding day was also an unexpected one – the early arrival of their daughter Eva, who was born less than eight hours after the couple tied the knot. 

The New Zealand couple celebrated their wedding and the birth of their first child in the same day, when their daughter arrived 11 days early.

Liz Shlimon, 39, went into labour on the night of June 5, the day before their wedding was scheduled to take place at a registry office, but she was determined to make it down the aisle.

Liz and Mario Shlimon got married while Liz was in labour and just hours later Mrs Shlimon gave birth to their first child, Eva

Mrs Shlimon's midwife told her she could get married, as long as she was at the hospital by 7pm on Friday, despite her waters breaking on Thursday night.

The couple persisted with their plans, with Mrs Shlimon experiencing contractions at the hairdresser while she was getting ready for the wedding.

The contractions continued throughout the morning, resulting in the ceremony starting slightlylater than planned.

'I was thinking, "Just hold on there, just hang on. I've got to get through,"' she told stuff.co.nz.

The couple’s two o’clock ceremony was short but sweet, and Mr and Mrs Shlimon decided to fit in lunch with their bridal party before they checked into Wellington Hospital.

'I couldn't sit down. The waiter was a bit concerned, he kept hanging around. He said "I hope you don't have the baby here",' she told stuff.co.nz.

As Mr and Mrs Shlimon arrived at the hospital, still in their wedding clothes, they were met with applause from hospital staff who threw confetti over them.

Mrs Shlimon traded her wedding gown for a hospital robe and gave birth to Eva Alishwa Shlimon at 9.50pm and she told MailOnline the baby is doing well.

Mrs Shlimon said she was 'blown away' by people's interest in the birth and gushed about her new husband's parenting skills.

'Mario's good at the night times, so I get a wee bit of sleep,' she told MailOnline.

The proud father, who runs a kebab shop in Porirua, announced the arrival of his first child on Facebook.

'The Kebab King's been a bit busy this weekend. Married at 2pm Friday and the early arrival of Eva at 9.50pm. Even had confetti on arrival at wellington hospital delivery suite!!' he wrote.

Friends took to social media to express their congratulations. 

'Congratulations, you both look lovely in the wedding pic and and your baby is gorgeous, that's actually very funny, what a honeymoon night lol,' wrote Fiona Wright.

'What a beautiful couple. Auntie Liz & Uncle Mario oh my what a eventful day,' wrote Melissa Mclellan.
