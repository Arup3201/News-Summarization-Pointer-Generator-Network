Israel has re-arrested 51 Palestinians freed in a 2011 prisoner swap deal, the army said on today as it presses on with a furious search for three missing Israeli teens believed to have been abducted in the West Bank.

Israel believes Hamas was behind the abduction of the teens, who disappeared last week on the way home from a religious seminary, and has intensified a clampdown on the militant group.

The 51 rearrested prisoners were part of a group of 1,027 Palestinians released in 2011 from Israeli prisons in exchange for Israeli soldier Gilad Schalit captured by Gaza militants in a cross-border raid in 2006.

Gilad Shalit was an Israeli soldier captured in Gaza by Hamas in 2006 and held for five years before being traded for the release of 1,027 Palestinians

They
 were rearrested overnight, along with 14 other Palestinians, bringing 
the total number of those arrested since the teens' disappearance to 
240, according to army spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner.

Prime
 Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was swift to praise the latest arrests, 
which brought the total number of those detained to 240.

'The
 operation tonight in which Hamas terrorists were arrested, including 
some who had been freed in exchange for the return of Gilad Shalit, is a
 component with an important message in a series of many actions,' he 
said in a stateme

He has 
also used the incident to try to discredit the new Palestinian unity 
government, which has Hamas backing, and has called on the international
 community to urge Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to end his unity 
deal with Hamas.

Israel has said it does not know if 
Gil-Ad Shaer and U.S.-Israeli national Naftali Fraenkel, both aged 16, 
and Eyal Yifrah, 19, are alive or what their captors' demands might be.

Gilad Shalit was an Israeli soldier captured in Gaza by Hamas in 2006 and held for five years before being traded for the release of 1,027 Palestinians.

Shalit, then a 19-year-old sergeant, was abducted  by militants who tunnelled into Israel from the Gaza Strip and surprised his tank crew, killing two of his comrades.

He was whisked back into Gaza and has since been held incommunicado – many believe in underground cells.

A skilfully orchestrated campaign led by his family and a growing army of supporters, some of whom camped in tents for 15 months outside the prime minister’s office in Jerusalem, piled the pressure on Netanyahu’s government to act.

He was eventually released looking thin and pale.

He told an Egyptian TV interviewer that he hoped his release would further the peace efforts and help end the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians.

His release was generally widely supported by the Israeli population, although there were concerns that trade would spark further kidnappings.

Since 
the swap in 2011, Palestinian militants have called for more kidnappings
 of Israelis in efforts to release Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli
 jails.

'We have two efforts ongoing in 
parallel. First is to bring back the boys, and the second is to take a 
toll on Hamas for its actions,' spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Peter 
Lerner said.

'What Israel is doing has nothing to 
do with security, but is a policy of revenge,' said Qadoura Fares, 
chairman of the Palestinian Prisoners Club, which advocates on behalf of
 Palestinians in Israeli custody.

An
 Egyptian official said that Cairo, which is in contact with Hamas and 
other Palestinian factions, was helping Israel gather information that 
might lead to the missing teenagers.

But
 the official, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, denied 
Israeli and Palestinian media reports that Egyptian mediation was 
already under way to return the boys.

'There
 is a flow of information (between Egypt and Israel), but we are still 
short of information, so there is no negotiation,' the official said.

Israel
 has not provided proof of Hamas' involvement in the teens' 
disappearance, but Gilad Erdan, an Israeli minister, told Israel Radio 
on Wednesday that Israel knows which Hamas cell was responsible.

He did not elaborate.

Hamas has praised the kidnapping, but not claimed responsibility.

Since
 the teens disappeared, Israeli soldiers have searched 800 locations in 
the West Bank and carried out operations against 10 Hamas civilian 
institutions there, including raiding a Hamas radio station overnight, 
Lerner said.

'These actions are already striking a substantial blow to Hamas infrastructure, institutions, and operatives,' Lerner added.

There has been no sign of life from the missing teens or any ransom or other demands from their purported kidnappers.

Lerner said the army is continuing to impose restrictions on movement 
in the Hebron region in an effort to prevent the abductors from taking 
the three out of the West Bank.

Prayer vigils and round-the-clock media coverage have followed the teens' disappearance.

Palestinian Sunni fundamentalist group
 Hamas was founded in 1987, during the First Intifada uprising against 
Israeli military occupation of the Palestinian Territories.

It
 has ruled the Gaza strip since winning a decisive majority in elections
 in 2007, but the rival Fatah movement retained control of the West 
Bank.

The two parties remained at odds until a recent reconciliation led
 to the swearing in of a Palestinian unity government last week.

Israeli
 newspaper pundits said Israel was using the opportunity of the 
kidnapping to bring about the collapse of the newly-formed unity 
government, which has been furiously denounced by Netanyahu.

Nearly 20,000 people have shown their support for a Facebook page calling for Israeli forces to kill a Palestinian 'terrorist' every hour until three missing Jewish teenagers are returned.

The page, in Hebrew, which features images of Palestinian men behind crosshairs, was started a day after the trio disappeared while hitchhiking in Israeli-occupied Palestinian territory.

It appeals to Israelis to eliminate 'terrorists' until the teenagers are found, the International Business Times reports. 

Writing in the top-selling Yediot Aharonot, Alex Fishman said the kidnapping had created a 'one-time operational opportunity' which Israel would use 'to castrate' Hamas and suppress its 'strongholds in Palestinian Authority territory to the greatest extent possible.'

By crushing Hamas's infrastructure, it would weaken the movement ahead of Palestinian elections which under the unity deal are supposed to take place before the end of the year, Fishman said.

'Removing the political leadership from the West Bank is supposed to weaken Hamas in advance of the Palestinian presidential elections,' he said.

Writing in Haaretz, Amos Harel agreed. 'The purpose of the Israeli actions ... is to drive a wedge between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, and stop the reconciliation process that began some two months ago,' he wrote.

But as the manhunt entered its fifth day, commentators voiced concern about growing reports of violence around the West Bank, sparking fears that an already tense situation could rapidly escalate.
