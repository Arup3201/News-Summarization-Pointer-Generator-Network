A former Sky TV worker is fighting for her life in a coma today after breaking her neck in a horrific car crash in the Caribbean where she was living and working as a diving instructor.   

Kate Clayton from Southampton suffered the devastating injuries when her car swerved off a country road in the Cayman Islands.

The 30-year-old expat, who moved to the islands in December 2013, was driving her Jeep Wrangler 4x4 home from a night out when she lost control going round a tight corner and slammed into a tree.

She was today fighting for her life and was in a coma after sustaining serious injuries to her back as well as a broken neck and pelvis.

It was thought her father, Bill, had flown out to be at her bedside at George Town Hospital, on Grand Cayman, where her condition was described as serious but stable.

Friends on the island told how Miss Clayton had been out at a bar and restaurant called Over The Edge on the night the crash happened.

She moved to Grand Cayman, which is popular with British tourists, in December 2013 after leaving her job as an analyst at broadcaster Sky.

There she took up a job as a dive master, helping people to explore the Caribbean Sea with a company called Tortuga Divers. 

A spokesman from Royal Cayman Islands Police Service said: 'On January 11 2015 at about 21:52 pm, 911 received a report of a serious motor vehicle accident on Old Robin Road, North Side in the vicinity of the 'On the Bay Condos' involving a single vehicle.

'A Jeep Wrangler driven by a 30-year-old female resident of East End was travelling on Old Robin Road headed in the direction of Queens Highway when it veered off the Road before negotiating a sharp right bend corner and collided into large trees.

'The driver sustained serious head and back injuries. She was transported to the George Town Hospital where she is still admitted.

'A welfare check on her today by an officer of the RCIPS revealed that she is stable and responding, but she remains in critical condition.

'The matter is under investigation by officers of the Bodden Town Police Station.'
