When the Duchess of Cambridge suggested that her husband needed an alpaca wool wig to cover up his bald patch, most people took it as a joke.

But one American magazine might have taken the issue more seriously - by covering up Prince William's bald patch for its front page photo.

A photo of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge with their son Prince George, which was taken during the family's visit to the Taronga Zoo in Sydney in April this year, is featured on the front cover of Vanity Fair's August edition.

Vanity Fair is accused of digitally thickening The Duke of Cambridge's hair in its front cover photo, pictured left, from an original image taken in Australia, pictured rightÂ 

The image shows the Duchess of Cambridge smiling at her husband as he looks fondly at his son.

But a comparison of the front cover with the original photo appears to show Prince William's hair looking much thicker than it is.

The suggested retouching of the image was spotted by fashion website Racked, which compared the two images side-by-side.

The website then commented: 'Upon comparison it 
is undeniable that Vanity Fair has photoshopped a little more hair onto 
that head. Le scandal!'

A spokesman for the magazine told the Telegraph that it had altered the photo but that it had not added more hair to Prince William's head.

The spokesman said: 'We gave the image a poster-like palette. Because it is a cover image, the colours are richer and more graphic and vibrant. We obviously did not add more hair.

'His face, head and shoulders were just darkened as though he was a bit in the shadow... which put more emphasis on Prince George,'

During that same tour of Australia and New Zealand, from which the photo was taken, the Duchess of Cambridge handed her husband some alpaca wool and suggested he use it as a wig, commenting: 'You need it more than me.'

The future king himself joked about his receding hairline after Prince George was born, telling waiting photographers and reporters: 'He's got more hair than me, thank God.'

Previously, the Duchess has been given an airbrushed waist by Grazia magazine in pictures of the royal wedding, while US Weekly was also accused of manipulating a photo of their son Prince 
George, who turns one on July 22.

Historian Dan Snow told the Telegraph that retouching images of the Royal Family was historically about highlighting the positive parts of a royal.

He said: 'It is following an honourable tradition of making the best of your subject, whether royal or not.'
