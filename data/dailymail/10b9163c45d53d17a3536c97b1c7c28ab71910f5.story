A 17-year old con artist managed to steal $30,000 from three Walmarts and even hugged one of the store managers when he left with the cash in his hand.

The Norman, Oklahoma, boy, whose identity hasn't been revealed because he is a minor, dressed up like an employee and tricked the Walmart managers at all three locations back in December.

Norman police caught the boy and arrested him on January 30.

The teen pretended to be an employee at three different Walmarts and stole a total of $30,000

The Police report states that the boy 'acted as a if he was a general manager from another store.' It also states that he was wearing the company's name tag. Kfor reports that the boy said 'he was doing an inventory of the store before general managers came to inspect them after the holidays.'

Surveillance cameras contained footage of the sly perpetrator. According to the police report, the boy was alone in the cash room and took multiple bundles of cash which he stuffed into his pockets.

Sgt. Jeremy Lewis was impressed by the teens ability to fool each and every Walmart. The teen knew what he was doing because he worked for Walmart back in Oklahoma City but was fired for stealing money.

After he was fired he put on his uniform and went to an Edmond store he was not employed at and he was assigned to work at the register. He pocketed more than $3,000 that day.

Finally when the teen tried to pretend to be an employee at the Norman Walmart, his game was over.

The Cleveland County Ditrsict Attorney is working on the boy's case butwhteher or not he will be tried as an adult in still being decided.
