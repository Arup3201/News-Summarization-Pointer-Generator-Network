Arsenal have released a sneak peak of Aaron Ramsey modelling their new training kit ahead of the release of their new strips.

The launch for their new kits for the upcoming 2014-15 season is set to take place this Thursday.

The Gunners' kits are set to be produced
 by Puma for the first time, after their 20-year partnership with Nike 
came to an end this summer.

Winner: Ramsey clutches the trophy following FA Cup victory in May

In the buildup to the release, Arsenal released some teaser footage last week of their new shirts, with a trailer featuring the likes of Mikel Arteta, Theo Walcott, Mesut Ozil, Santi Cazorla and Olivier Giroud.

Arsenal will be hoping that a change of manufacturer won't bring them a change in luck after their FA Cup victory in May brought a nine-year barren trophy run to an end.

The club have lost right-back Bacary Sagna to rivals Manchester City this summer, but are still hopeful of adding a few new faces before the start of the season.
