It is a slice of paradise that comes with its own white beach, a 23,000 square feet luxury home and even a private rainforest.

The Rai Ki Wai estate, which translates as View Over The Sea, is so exclusive that it shares the whole Fijian island of Wakaya with just seven other homes.

But this kind of luxury comes at a price. The 46-acre estate is being sold at auction with no reserve next month but has been valued at a whopping £7.5million ($12million).

Slice of paradise: The stunning island is a 30-minute flight from Fiji's main airport and can only be accessed by secured dock or helipad

The house is set at the highest spot on the island, offering stunning views of the South Pacific.

It includes six suites in separate pavilions — each with en-suite bathrooms, decks and gardens - and an additional bedroom with full bathroom.

The opulent estate has Fijian hardwood floors and is styled on Balinese and Asian designs.

Among the stunning features are a main pavilion with a 4,200 square feet living/ bar area and a separate pavilion housing an enormous 5,000 square feet master bedroom.

Guest pavilions have airy 32-foot ceilings, spa bathtubs, indoor/ outdoor showers and private decks.

If this was not enough, the estate has an outdoor pool, with unobstructed ocean views.

American owner Giselle Fernandez said the island has been an 'oasis of spirit' for her family.

She said: 'The seascapes and sparkling reefs and vistas embraced us with nature's grandest offerings. The Fijian people's village traditions became ours and enriched our lives in countless ways.

'I can't say enough about our 11 magical years on Wakaya Island and the enchantment of our grand Rai Ki Wai estate.

'We loved it so much. We spent months at a time over the years, shared its enchanting wiles with friends and family and raised our child there.

'Now with our daughter growing up and in school and grandchildren here in the states, and more on the way, our lives have changed, and it's not so easy to escape away as we once did.'

Ms Fernandez said: 'Whoever steps next into this island paradise will experience more than just the joy of an exquisite retreat — Rai Ki Wai is simply an encounter with spirit at every turn and a destined adventure of the soul.'

Rai Ki Wai estate is being auctioned by New York-based Concierge Auctions on October 3.
