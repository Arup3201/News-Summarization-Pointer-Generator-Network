Wales hooker Ken Owens has undergone a scan to gauge the extent of a neck injury suffered during training.

Owens missed the Scarlets' Guinness PRO12 victory over Treviso four days ago.

The Scarlets have now announced he has been assessed by their own medical team, while consultation has also taken place with specialists.

'We have undergone a thorough process of consultation with specialists over the last few days in regards to Ken's injury, and will decide on the best course of action in the coming days.' Scarlets head of performance Andrew Walker said.

Owens, 27, has started Wales' last three Tests, including both summer tour games against South Africa, and is an integral part of national coach Warren Gatland's plans.

He made his international debut during the 2011 World Cup and has gone on to win 26 caps, vying for the number two shirt with Richard Hibbard.

Wales kick off their autumn Test schedule against Australia on November 8, before tackling Fiji, New Zealand and the Springboks.
