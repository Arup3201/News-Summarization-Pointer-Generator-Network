Google has taken action after its search engine was found to be suggesting vile racist terms when users searched for a number of UK cities including Bradford, Leicester and Birmingham.

The search engine was found to be making crude and offensive suggestions when users typed in 'Why is' followed by the name of a city.

For example, if a user typed in the phrase 'Why is Bradford...' the site automatically suggested the search 'Why is Bradford so full of P****.'

Typing in the phrase with Leicester and Birmingham also produced similar results.

Google took action after its search engine was found to be producing racist slurs. If users typed in 'Why is' followed by a number of UK cities it would auto-complete the search to 'so full of P****'  (library image)

Google took immediate action against the Autocomplete suggestions and removed all of them from the site. Certain other racist insults do remain, however.

The site said the suggestions are produced by combining algorithms that predict what people will search for with popular searches.

The internet giant said: 'Autocomplete is a feature of Google search that offers predicted searches to help you more quickly find what you’re looking for.

'These searches are produced automatically based on a number of factors including the popularity of search terms.

'We periodically update our systems to improve Search, so the terms that appear in Autocomplete may change over time.'

Speaking with Matt Quinton at The Sun, Labour MP for Leicester East Keith Vaz said: 'I am shocked these search options come up.

Google boss Eric Schmidt. Last year, he confirmed the site would block all links to child abuse online

'It is totally unacceptable and I will be raising this matter in Parliament'

Google has come under fire in the past for acting slowly to remove or block indecent images online.

The company initially refused to sign up to an alert system that would block people from viewing vile images on the internet, saying it had its own methods of blocking such material.

At the time, The Home Affairs Committee, which is chaired by Mr Vaz, accused 'complacent' internet service providers and search engines of being 'far too laid back about what takes place on their watch'.

Speaking in July last year, he said: 'The Prime Minister was right to highlight the responsibility of the internet service providers, search engines and social media sites.

'They are far too laid back about what takes place on their watch and they need to do more to take inappropriate content down. If they do not act, the Government should legislate.'

However, in November the company's CEO Eric Schmidt said the search engine would block all links to child sexual abuse online.

In a piece in the Daily Mail, he wrote: 'We've fine-tuned Google Search to prevent links to child sexual abuse material from appearing in our results.'

In 2012, Google rejected the White House’s request to remove a controversial anti-Islam YouTube clip that sparked violent anti-American protests across the globe.

Instead the internet company, who own YouTube, censored the video in several locations as well as blocking it in Egypt and Libya - where U.S. embassies were stormed by protestors enraged over the depiction of the Prophet Mohammad as a fraud and philanderer.
