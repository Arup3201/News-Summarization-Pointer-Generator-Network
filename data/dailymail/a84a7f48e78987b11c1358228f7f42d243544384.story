When Indian student Prateek Verma decided to tell his father he had made his girlfriend pregnant, he thought it would be a hilarious prank.

What the 20-year-old didn't count on was the violent attack he would be subjected to after making his ill-judged announcement.

Infuriated by the revelation, Sunder 
Verma, 50, launches at his son in a fit of uncontrollable rage, kicking and punching 
him as the engineering student pleads for mercy.

As he father returns from work after what has clearly been a very bad day, Prateek says: 'Dad, I need to talk to you about something.'

Ominously, he adds: 'Please close the door. Mum should never know about it.'

He goes on to ask if his father remembers his girlfriend he had been seeing, to which Mr Verma replies: 'Yes, that b****'.

Prateek then drops the bombshell.

After a momentary pause, his father kick him hard then forces him into the corner of the room with a series of punches.

As Mr Verma picks up a bottle, his terrified son cries out that it was a prank.

His father reluctantly believes the story and walks out of the room dejected as Prateek looks on stunned.
