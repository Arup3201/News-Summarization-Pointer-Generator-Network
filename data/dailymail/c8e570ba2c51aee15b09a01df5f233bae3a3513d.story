WHY WE MAKE THINGS AND WHY IT MATTERS

by Peter Korn

(Square Peg, £15)

When my family and I moved from London to the heart of the Herefordshire countryside 13 years ago, one of our new neighbours (insofar as a man living six fields away can be called a neighbour) told us that, if we ever needed him, even in the middle of the night, all we had to do was to pick up the phone.

He was an electrician, this chap, but also had a passable knowledge of plumbing and carpentry, making him a wonderfully-competent, all-round handyman. I remember feeling inadequate, for my own skills are creative, but not practical. As a writer, I could hardly reciprocate his kindness. What would I say? ‘And likewise, should you ever need a perfectly formed sentence at 3am . . .’

This exquisitely-produced little book had a similar, humbling effect on me. Korn makes beautiful, bespoke furniture; at his celebrated school in Maine, in the far north-east of America, he teaches others how to do it, too.

This is not a how-to manual, though — it is a philosophical treatise about the process and the emotional rewards of creating something tangible, useful, long-lasting and attractive to look at. My branch of creativity seems rather feeble by comparison.

Korn writes seductively about the fulfilment he gets from making furniture. While the book didn’t quite make me want to go and bevel an edge, it did help me understand how a lovingly handcrafted chair or desk might be considered a counterblast to what Korn describes as modern society’s ‘rampant consumerism’.

As he asserts, handmade furniture ‘speaks of durability at a time when most goods are disposable. It speaks of integrity of process in a culture where surface impressions are often all that matter’. Which is true enough, but Ikea on a Saturday afternoon is full of people who might well prefer to be buying handmade furniture — if only they could afford it. I don’t think Korn means that they are doing the wrong thing, just that they — we — should take more time to appreciate proper craftsmanship.

That he thinks as deeply as he does about furniture-making clearly has something to do with two serious bouts of cancer, once in his 20s and again in his 40s. Brushes with death do tend to make a chap more introspective and the book, taking the form of a memoir, details other convulsions in his life, such as financial hardship, romantic heartache and divorce.

But through all his tribulations, the dovetail joint has held firm. I know devoted cricketers and golfers who will tell you, without the slightest irony, that their sports are metaphors for life, and Korn, without ever quite being pretentious enough to say so, seems to believe the same of fashioning tables and chairs.

‘In furniture-making, beginnings are critical,’ he says. And a little later: ‘Throughout the entire process, the quality achievable at each stage is utterly dependent on the care with which the craftsman has accomplished every previous step.’ Well, what is that if not a guideline on how we should all get the most out of our lives?
