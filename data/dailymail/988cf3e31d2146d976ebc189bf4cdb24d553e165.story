It may be a fortnight without action in a Barcelona shirt for Lionel Messi, but the Argentine is still having to undergo recovery in the international break.

Fans fearing the worst at seeing Messi on a treatment table can rest assured though as the forward still looks ready to take on Portugal at Old Trafford on Tuesday.

Messi was relaxed as he sat for a recovery session in Manchester, sipping a tea and talking to a friend.

The 27-year-old may also have been in a rather jovial mood, with reasons for his recovery time perhaps due to  a tennis football tournament he had competed in earlier in the day.

It was one that looked to be worth it though as he posed with Javier Mascherano and Manchester United's Angel di Maria, with his Barca team-mate proclaiming the trio were champions of the competition.

It may not quite prove enough consolation for Argentina who lost the World Cup final earlier this year to Germany - but bigger tests are to come for the trio.

Messi was the star attraction as he scored the winning goal in Argentina's 2-1 friendly win over Croatia at Upton Park last Wednesday.

But the World Cup Golden Ball winner will go head-to-head with his on-pitch rival and World Player of the Year Cristiano Ronaldo when Argentina and Portugal clash at Old Trafford on Tuesday.
