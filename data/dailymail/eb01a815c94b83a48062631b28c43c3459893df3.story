A Delaware Deputy Attorney General has been arrested for sexually assaulting an underage boy he met on Grindr.

Daniel Simmons, 34, of Wilmington, met the 16-year-old boy on the popular gay and bisexual dating app earlier this year, authorities said.

He has been charged with four counts of fourth-degree rape for his encounters with the teen, according to the Delaware News Journal.

Found online: Daniel Simmons found his teen victim through an online dating app, police said

Simmons was arrested Friday after a more than one month investigation looked into his interactions with the boy, sources told the paper.

That investigation found that Simmons was the primary aggressor in the encounters, authorities said.

‘These charges are serious and will be addressed through the criminal justice system,’ a state Attorney General’s Office spokesperson said.

Investigators believe there may be more victims who have yet to come forward.

Bail information was not immediately available, nor was his next court date.
