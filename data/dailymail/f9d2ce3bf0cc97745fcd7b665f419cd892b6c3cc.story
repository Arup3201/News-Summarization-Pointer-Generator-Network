With just two months to go before the birth of her seventh child, Kathy, 38, from Mount Hagen in Papua New Guinea, was looking forward to welcoming her new baby into the world.

But tragically, the moment would never arrive. Instead, after a harrowing two day ordeal which saw her repeatedly beaten and raped with an iron bar, Kathy's baby was dead.

Why? Because her family and neighbours believed - wrongly - that she was a witch.

Endemic: A woman suspected of being a witch is burned alive after being gang raped in Mount Hagen

Kathy's Mount Hagen homeland is the capital of Papua New Guinea's Eastern Highlands, a place notorious for tribal violence, a ruthlessly applied system of 'payback' and dangerously high levels of drink and drugs.

It is also one of the most dangerous places in the world to be a woman, with a shocking 99 per cent of women thought to have suffered violence of some sort at some point in their lives.

Women are, according to locals, worth less than pigs, while many more fall victim to the same sort of superstitious belief as Kathy.

In Mount Hagen, women suspected of being witches can be stoned, burned alive or even burned at the stake.

Kathy was at a family funeral when the phone call that would change her life forever was patched through.

Upsetting: Kathy's story is all too common in Papua New Guinea where violence against women is endemic

Prisoners: Ross Kemp talks to some of the men incarcerated in Port Moresby. Many of the men are rapists

Damascus, Syria

The war-torn Syrian capital was deemed the world's worst place to live by the Economist's Intelligence Unit.

Dhaka, Bangladesh

Extreme poverty combined with rickety infrastructure make the Bangladeshi capital a poor choice for a des res.

Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea

Endemic violence of every sort imaginable plus terrible poverty.

Lagos, Nigeria

The African metropolis was given the lowest stability score by the brains at the Economist.

Harare, Zimbabwe

Thanks to continuing economic and political crises, Harare is considered the fifth worst place to live.

Algiers, Algeria

Terrorist groups prowl the streets while much of the beautiful old town has been destroyed by war and natural disasters.

Karachi, Pakistan

Frequent terrorist attacks combined with a sky high murder rate make Pakistan's second city a dangerous place to be.

Tripoli, Libya

The last two years have seen the Libyan capital face regular outbreaks of violence and near-permanent protests.

Douala, Cameroon

Central Africa's wealthiest city it might be but health provision is terrible and crime just as bad.

Tehran, Iran

Although the Iranian capital got high scores for health and education, its rickety infrastructure let the side down.

'There was a phone call and the person on
 the phone said: "This dead person, whose funeral you've just had, she's
 the one who ate his heart",' she remembers.

'That's why they took me and tied my hands 
up with barbed wire.' At the time, she was seven months pregnant but even that wasn't enough to save her from what followed.

'I was 
strapped up with barbed wire,' she recalls. 'Then they dragged me to the house and 
locked me inside.

'They took my blouse, put a bush knife through my 
blouse, my skirt and my tights, took them off and threw them aside. One 
of them pulled my leg, one of them pulled the other and one man pushed 
my head back, and I stayed like that. I didn't do anything and I didn't 
move.'

Already bleeding from the cruel barbed wire and in terror for her life, Kathy hoped that by doing nothing, the men might be persuaded to leave her alone.

But worse was to come. 'One of them split some firewood and made a fire outside,' she says. 'They 
heated up iron rods, spades and bush knives and when they were really 
hot, they came in and put them on my skin.

'They damaged all my skin. 
They pushed an iron into my vagina. They tortured me for two days,' she continues.

'Five times
 they pushed the rod into my vagina. The things they did to me... They 
destroyed me. My vagina is still very sore. They shoved iron rods inside
 me. It's totally destroyed my rectum and my vagina.'

And Kathy's story is by no means unique, as Ross Kemp, points out in the newest series of Extreme World.

Papua New Guinea is home to endemic violence, fuelled by the tribal 'payback' system and made worse by illegal moonshine, drugs and poverty.

It's capital, Port Moresby, was recently declared one of the worst cities to live in on the planet by the Economist Intelligence Unit, with only Syria's war-torn capital Damascus and Bangladeshi capital Dhaka deemed worse.

One of the woman to brave the city is Esther Igo of Women Arise Papua New Guinea, who in an interview with Kemp, declared that violence has gone 'beyond epidemic levels.'

'Every day there is a death, there is a rape, there is a killing, there is a murder, there is some sort of violence,' she explained.

'It's like the whole system, the social structure is breaking down. It's broken. It's all broken.'

Tribes: The country has more than hundreds of different groups while 800 different languages are spoken

For many, Kathy among them, the damage is already beyond repair. Her baby, just months from being born, was killed during the brutal attack while Kathy herself is scarred for life and lives in fear of the men who beat her.

'I was crying and I 
couldn't stop,' she says of the experience. 'The pain was so severe, my baby died and I wanted to die.

'I said: "Don't damage me anymore" but they wouldn't listen. So I asked 
them to cut my head off so I could go to Heaven and not feel the pain 
anymore.'
