David Beckham has visited the storm-devastated Philippine city of Tacloban as part of UNICEF's relief efforts. 

The central city is still struggling to deal with the impact of super Typhoon Haiyan, which struck in November, killing more than 6,200 people and leaving tens of thousands of survivors still homeless.

Beckham was welcomed by hundreds who have been living in United Nations-provided tents outside a stadium.
