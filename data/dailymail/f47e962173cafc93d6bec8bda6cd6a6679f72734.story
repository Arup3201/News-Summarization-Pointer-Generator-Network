Five inmates who escaped from a California jail have now all been caught and are back in custody two days after they broke free.

Roel Soliz, 29, Juan Lopez, 33, Jorge Lopez-Diaz, 26, Abel Ramos, 25, Ricardo Cendejas, 19, are now all back in custody after they got out of Madera County Jail in California. 

Soliz was the last person to be caught this afternoon. He was apprehended in Fairmead after police received an anonymous phone tip.

The four other escapees - who were being held for various charges including attempted murder and armed robbery - were caught late on Saturday evening.

The Madera County Sheriff's Major Crimes Unit and Madera Special Investigations Unit made the capture of the four inmates last night.

Lopez was being held for four charges: attempted murder, parole violation, strong armed robbery, and probation violation.

The men reportedly escaped from Madera County Jail 

Cendejas was being held for five charges: attempted murder, armed robbery, strong arm robbery, carjacking and promoting/assisting further felonious acts with a street gang.

Soliz was held for four charges: parole violation, burglary, probation violation, and possession of a controlled substance.

Lastly, Lopez-Diaz was being held for strong arm robbery and interfering with an officer.

The men were last seen wearing either orange jumpsuits or white T- shirts with blue shorts and orange jail-issued sandals. It is not clear whether they knew or were associated with each other prior to their arrests, Stuart said.
