A former NYPD officer branded the 'cannibal cop' for allegedly plotting to kidnap, murder and eat more than 100 women is now working as a jailhouse cook, it was revealed today.

And his pizza is so good, even the guards eat it.

Gilberto Valle was convicted in March 2013 of conspiring to commit heinous acts of murder, torture and cannibalism - including on his own wife.

New line of work: Gilberto Valle, a former New York police officer, is now a cook in the jail where he's being held awaiting sentencing

The New York Daily News reports that Valle's mother, Elizabeth, says her son now 'kills time' cooking lunch and breakfast at Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan.

Valle is appealing the conviction and a federal judge has not passed sentence on the former Queens, New York, patrolman while he weighs whether to grant a new trial.

Valle's fellow inmates know all about his reputation and even crack wise about his alleged plot to skin and roast women like sides of beef.

'Don’t stand too close to the oven!' the prisoners joke, Mrs Valle told the Daily News.

For his work in the kitchen, Valle is paid 44 cents an hour. 

His mother says it keeps him occupied while he plots his new defense tactics. 

Valle, a patrolman for the NYPD, was arrested in October 2012 after his wife, Kathleen Mangan, found disturbing pictures on his computer that he had downloaded from the site DarkFetishNet.com.

Valle's own wife, Kathleen Mangan, right, turned him in to police when she found a drove of his writings about cannibalism. She divorced him in July

Mrs Valle said Kathleen has taken the couple's young daughter and completely cut off all contact with him and his family

The FBI found a list of 100 women he said he planned to kill, cook and eat.

They also found a transcript of an online chat in which he said he planned to take his 'girlfriend' Kathleen to Pakistan, where he and another man would murder her and cannibalize her body.

Valle maintains that his extensive writings were nothing more than fantasy - never meant to be acted on or carried out.

'He’s not the monster they portray him to be,' Mrs Valle told the Daily News.

'He's innocent.'

Mangan, who testified against her husband at trial, was granted a divorce in July, Mrs Valle said.

She has taken the couple's young daughter and completely cut off all contact with Valle and his family, she said.
