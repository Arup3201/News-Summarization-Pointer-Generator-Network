President Obama left a pleasantly warm Washington this morning for a near blizzard in New Hampshire to drum up voter support as the presidential election loomed on the horizon.

Wrapped in a long overcoat, the President smiled and shook hands in the snow on the runway in Manchester as the temperature hovered around 25F. Obama had set off from the capital where it was a bright and sunny day with the temperatures climbing to 66F.

His convoy then moved off slowly in the slippery conditions to Nashua Community College where he toured the school's automotive lab before making a speech.

Obama has demanded that Congress 
eliminate oil and gas company subsidies that he called an outrageous 
government 'giveaway', an idea the White House believes resonates at a time of high gasoline prices.

Obama said: 'Let's put every single member of 
Congress on record: you can stand with oil companies or you can stand up
for the American people.'

The President also said claims from the Republican camps 
that his policies were hiking gas prices won't pass 'a political 
bull-detector' test.

His remarks came as retail gasoline prices 
rose today to a national average of $3.74 per gallon.

Obama has repeatedly called for an end to $4 billion in annual tax breaks and subsidies for oil and gas companies.

He told the college crowd: 'It's outrageous. It's inexcusable. I'm asking Congress - eliminate this oil industry giveaway right away.'

It was Obama's latest and most direct appeal to Congress to act on the tax breaks, a move that was certain to get stiff Republican opposition.

On the presidential campaign trail, GOP front-runner Mitt Romney and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich have decried Obama's energy policies.

Anticipating the President's speech, Romney argued in Fargo, North Dakota, that the president has tried to slow oil, gas and coal production through his Environmental Protection Agency and changes in policies governing federal lands.

Romney said: 'He's going to talk about how he's responsible for the increasing production of oil in this country, oil and gas in this country.

'Is he responsible for the increase? No, I didn't think so.'

Gingrich, campaigning in Woodstock, Georgia, called on Obama to fire Energy Secretary Steven Chu, approve a Canada-Texas pipeline and open more of the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska to oil drilling.

Gingrich said: 'He ran in 2008 on the slogan, ''Yes we can''. He's running this year on the slogan ''Why we couldn't''.'

New Hampshire is a small but strategically important general election battleground for the Democratic President.

Though Obama easily carried New Hampshire in 2008, the President and his staff have paid particular political attention to the state in recent months.

The trip marks the President's second 
visit to the state in about three months. Vice President Joe Biden has 
been a frequent visitor to New Hampshire, and First Lady Michelle held a
conference call with campaign volunteers in the state yesterday.

Though New Hampshire offers only four electoral votes in the November election, Democrats have been watching the state warily following its sharp shift to the right in the 2010 mid-term elections.

Further fueling concerns for Democrats are GOP front-runner Mitt Romney's personal ties to New Hampshire.

Romney served as governor of neighboring Massachusetts, owns a vacation home in New Hampshire and scored an overwhelming victory in the state's Republican primary in January.

However, a poll conducted in New 
Hampshire early last month showed Obama beating Romney by 10 percentage 
points in a hypothetical match-up.

Dante Scala, a political scientist at 
the University of New Hampshire, said that with the state's economy on 
solid footing compared with national trends and the President boosting 
his presence in the state, some New Hampshire Democrats were starting to
feel more confident about their prospects in November.

He said: 'There probably was concern 
among Democrats that maybe New Hampshire is not part of the president's 
re-election plan. Now things have kind of reverted back to form in a 
hurry.'

Following his remarks in New Hampshire, Obama travelled to New York for four campaign fundraisers.
