Real Madrid defender Sergio Ramos has defended team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo following his apparent strop during the 2-0 defeat of Levante on Sunday, saying: 'It is difficult to be Cristiano'.

The Portuguese superstar was criticised for his cold reaction towards both of Gareth Bale's goals as he failed to score himself before disappearing directly down the tunnel as his team-mates applauded fans after game.

It is not often that Ronaldo does not get his name on the scoresheet, although Ramos insists the 30-year-old deserves to be recognised for what he brings to the team beyond his goals.

'It is difficult to be Cristiano and he has been performing at a very high level for a number of years,' the defender told the official Madrid website.

'He knows himself better than anyone, he has a very competitive character and we are not worried if he didn't score if Bale subsequently did.

'We have to appreciate what he brings to the team.'

The Spain international insists that Madrid can recover from their so-called 'crisis' to beat Barcelona to the La Liga title and retain their Champions League crown.

'We must be more united than ever. It was a difficult game following the run of form that we have had and the level of pressure that is placed on Real Madrid, which is more than at any other team. We have to accept that, but I don't think that this is a troubling period.

'There are two months of top level competition left, we have one point less than the leaders and are in the quarter-finals of the Champions League, which is a tournament that is exciting us again.'

Ramos also gave his backing to under pressure coach Carlo Ancelotti who, despite bringing Los Blancos their elusive 10th European Cup last term, has found his position questioned following recent results. 

'Ancelotti is doing well. He has gone through a difficult situation but if anyone deserves respect, it is Ancelotti, especially after last season.'
