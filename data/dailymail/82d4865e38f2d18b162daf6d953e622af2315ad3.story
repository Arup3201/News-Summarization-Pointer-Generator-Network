An extraordinary letter from the nephew of Adolf Hitler has been discovered in which he begs to be allowed to enlist in the U.S. Army to fight against his uncle's facist regime.

William Patrick Hitler fled Nazi Germany when war broke out in 1939 to come and live with relatives in New York.

After being rejected from the U.S. Army because of his family connection, he wrote an emotional plea to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1942 on why he so strongly wanted to fight for Allied Forces.

One of the good guys: Adolf Hitler's nephew William, pictured with his mother Bridget, wrote to President Roosevelt in 1942 begging to be allowed to fight for the U.S. against his uncle's regime

In the letter, he wrote: 'I am the nephew and only descendant of 
the ill-famed Chancellor and Leader of Germany who today so despotically
 seeks to enslave the free and Christian peoples of the globe.

'More than anything else I would like to 
see active combat as soon as possible and thereby be accepted by my 
friends and comrades as one of them in this great struggle for liberty.'

The letter made its way into the hands of then FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover who approved Hitler for service against the Nazis.

William Hitler joined the Navy in 1944 but was removed from service three years later after being wounded.

William Patrick, who later changed his last name to Stuart-Houston, was the son of Adolf's half-brother Alois and first wife Bridget Dowling. He was born in Liverpool, England on March 12, 1911.

Three years later, Alois left his wife and son and took off for Europe. He remarried, becoming a bigamist, but kept in contact with his first wife. He settled in Germany asking Bridget to send William for a visit. She agreed in 1929 when William was 18.

William had a half-brother Heinz Hitler - however he became a committed Nazi (and was later tortured to death by the Soviets).

In 1933, William found himself in Nazi Germany where he planned to cash in on his uncle's rise to political fame. He badgered his uncle for a better job than the one he was given working in a bank.Â 

In 1938, Adolf offered his nephew a high-powered position within his organization but William fled to Britain, as he was suspicious that it was a trap.

He escaped from Germany in 1939 with the help of a British spy and quickly left for the U.S. with his mother.

After serving his stint with the U.S. Navy, William dropped the name Hitler. He married Phyllis Jean-Jacques and had four sons. The family settled in Patchogue, Long Island where he set up a medical laboratory business.

He died in 1987 at the age of 76 and was buried at the Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in Coram, New York.

The letter appears on the blog Letters Of Note after it was included in the book, War Letters: Extraordinary Correspondence from American Wars.

The correspondence comes from varying conflicts - reaching as far back as the Civil War to letters from American soldiers who fought in Bosnia in the 1990s.

The letters come from ordinary soldiers, sailors, airmen and medical staff - but also include some famous voices. Among the notes are the words of General William T. Sherman, Clara Barton, Theodore Roosevelt, Ernie Pyle and Julia Child.

March 3rd, 1942.His Excellency Franklin D. Roosevelt.,President of the United States of America.The White House.,Washington. D.C.

Dear Mr. President:

May I take the liberty of encroaching on your valuable time and that of your staff at the White House? Mindful of the critical days the nation is now passing through, I do so only because the prerogative of your high office alone can decide my difficult and singular situation.

Permit me to outline as briefly as possible the circumstances of my position, the solution of which I feel could so easily be achieved should you feel moved to give your kind intercession and decision.

I am the nephew and only descendant of the ill-famed Chancellor and Leader of Germany who today so despotically seeks to enslave the free and Christian peoples of the globe.

Under your masterful leadership men of all creeds and nationalities are waging desperate war to determine, in the last analysis, whether they shall finally serve and live an ethical society under God or become enslaved by a devilish and pagan regime.

Everybody in the world today must answer to himself which cause they will serve. To free people of deep religious feeling there can be but one answer and one choice, that will sustain them always and to the bitter end.

I am one of many, but I can render service to this great cause and I have a life to give that it may, with the help of all, triumph in the end.

All my relatives and friends soon will be marching for freedom and decency under the Stars and Stripes. For this reason, Mr. President, I am respectfully submitting this petition to you to enquire as to whether I may be allowed to join them in their struggle against tyranny and oppression?

At present this is denied me because when I fled the Reich in 1939 I was a British subject. I came to America with my Irish mother principally to rejoin my relatives here. At the same time I was offered a contract to write and lecture in the United States, the pressure of which did not allow me the time to apply for admission under the quota. I had therefore, to come as a visitor.

I have attempted to join the British forces, but my success as a lecturer made me probably one of the best attended political speakers, with police frequently having to control the crowds clamouring for admission in Boston, Chicago and other cities. This elicited from British officials the rather negative invitation to carry on.

The British are an insular people and while they are kind and courteous, it is my impression, rightly or wrongly, that they could not in the long run feel overly cordial or sympathetic towards an individual bearing the name I do. The great expense the English legal procedure demands in changing my name, is only a possible solution not within my financial means. At the same time I have not been successful in determining whether the Canadian Army would facilitate my entrance into the armed forces. As things are at the present and lacking any official guidance, I find that to attempt to enlist as a nephew of Hitler is something that requires a strange sort of courage that I am unable to muster, bereft as I am of any classification or official support from any quarter.

As to my integrity, Mr. President, I can only say that it is a matter of record and it compares somewhat to the foresighted spirit with which you, by every ingenuity known to statecraft, wrested from the American Congress those weapons which are today the Nation's great defense in this crisis. I can also reflect that in a time of great complacency and ignorance I tried to do those things which as a Christian I knew to be right. As a fugitive from the Gestapo I warned France through the press that Hitler would invade her that year. The people of England I warned by the same means that the so-called "solution" of Munich was a myth that would bring terrible consequences. On my arrival in America I at once informed the press that Hitler would loose his Frankenstein on civilization that year. Although nobody paid any attention to what I said, I continued to lecture and write in America. Now the time for writing and talking has passed and I am mindful only of the great debt my mother and I owe to the United States. More than anything else I would like to see active combat as soon as possible and thereby be accepted by my friends and comrades as one of them in this great struggle for liberty.

Your favorable decision on my appeal alone would ensure that continued benevolent spirit on the part of the American people, which today I feel so much a part of. I most respectfully assure you, Mr. President, that as in the past I would do my utmost in the future to be worthy of the great honour I am seeking through your kind aid, in the sure knowledge that my endeavors on behalf of the great principles of Democracy will at least bear favourable comparison to the activities of many individuals who for so long have been unworthy of the fine privilege of calling themselves Americans. May I therefore venture to hope, Mr. President, that in the turmoil of this vast conflict you will not be moved to reject my appeal for reasons which I am in no way responsible?

For me today there could be no greater honour, Mr. President, to have lived and to have been allowed to serve you, the deliverer of the American people from want, and no greater privelege then to have striven and had a small part in establishing the title you once will bear in posterity as the greatest Emancipator of suffering mankind in political history.

I would be most happy to give any additional information that might be required and I take the liberty of enclosing a circular containing details about myself.

Permit me, Mr. President, to express my heartfelt good wishes for your future health and happiness, coupled with the hope that you may soon lead all men who believe in decencey everywhere onward and upward to a glorious victory.

I am,Very respectfully yours,Patrick Hitler
