Scientists have successfully grown vaginas in a laboratory and implanted them into four teenage patients.

The new organs have been given to women born with MRKH - Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, a rare genetic condition 
in which the vagina and uterus are underdeveloped or absent.

The 
treatment could also potentially be applied to patients with vaginal 
cancer or injuries, according to the U.S. researchers.

Pioneering: Scientists have successfully grown vaginas in a laboratory and implanted them into patients born with a condition called MRKH - where the vagina and uterus are underdeveloped or absent

The organ structures were engineered using muscle and epithelial cells (the cells that line the body’s cavities) from a small biopsy of each patient’s external genitals.

The cells were extracted from the tissues, expanded and then placed on a biodegradable material that was hand-sewn into a vagina-like shape.

These scaffolds (pictued below) were tailor-made to fit each patient.

About five to six weeks after the biopsy, surgeons created a canal in the patient’s pelvis and attached the scaffold to reproductive structures.

At the same time the scaffolding material is being absorbed by the body, the cells lay down materials to form a permanent support structure – gradually replacing the engineered scaffold with a new organ.

The researchers, from the Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center's Institute for Regenerative Medicine, say four teenage girls have successfully received  vaginal organs that were engineered with their own cells.

Writing in The Lancet, programme leader by Dr Anthony Atala, said: 'This pilot study is the first to demonstrate that vaginal organs can be constructed in the lab and used successfully in humans.

'This may represent a new option for patients who require vaginal reconstructive surgeries. In addition, this study is one more example of how regenerative medicine strategies can be applied to a variety of tissues and organs.'

The girls were between 13 and 18 years old at the time of the surgeries, which were performed between June 2005 and October 2008.

Data from annual follow-up visits show that even up to eight years after the surgeries, the organs had normal function.

The vaginas were engineered using muscle and epithelial 
cells (the cells that line the body's cavities) from a small biopsy of 
each patient's external genitals.

The cells were then extracted from the tissues, expanded and then 
placed on a biodegradable material that was hand-sewn into a vagina-like
 shape.

These scaffolds were tailor-made to fit each patient.

About
 five to six weeks after the biopsy, surgeons created a canal in the 
patient's pelvis and sutured the scaffold to reproductive structures.

MRKH (Mayer Rokitansky Küster Hauser) is a congenital abnormality which affects one in 5,000 women in the UK.

It is characterised by the absence of the vagina, womb  and cervix.

Women
 suffering from the condition will have normally functioning ovaries and
 so will experience the normal signs of puberty but will not have 
periods or be able to conceive.

The external genatalia are completely normal which is why MRKH isn’t usually discovered until women are in their teenage years.

It’s usually discovered when the woman tries to has sex or fails to get her period.

Many
 women are able to create a vaginal canal using dilation treatment, 
which uses cylinder shaped dilators of different sizes to stretch the 
muscles.

However, if this is unsuccessful then surgery will be used to stretch the vaginal canal.

Following treatment women are able to have intercourse and can have their eggs removed and fertilised to be used in surrogacy.

Previous research in Dr Atala's lab has shown that 
once cell-seeded scaffolds are implanted in the body, nerves and blood 
vessels form and the cells expand and form tissue.

At the same time the 
scaffolding material is being absorbed by the body, the cells lay down 
materials to form a permanent support structure – gradually replacing 
the engineered scaffold with a new organ.

Follow-up testing on the
 lab-engineered vaginas showed the margin between native tissue and the 
engineered segments was indistinguishable.

In addition, the patients' responses to a Female Sexual Function 
Index questionnaire showed they had normal sexual function after the 
treatment, including desire and pain-free intercourse.

"Tissue biopsies, MRI scans and internal exams using magnification all showed that the engineered vaginas were similar in makeup and function to native tissue, said Atlantida-Raya Rivera, lead author and director of the HIMFG Tissue Engineering Laboratory in Mexico City, where the surgeries were performed.

Current treatments for MRHK syndrome include dilation of existing tissue or reconstructive surgery to create new vaginal tissue.

A variety of materials can be used to surgically construct a new vagina – from skin grafts to tissue that lines the abdominal cavity. However, these substitutes often lack a normal muscle layer and some patients can develop a narrowing or contracting of the vagina.

The researchers say that with conventional treatments, the overall complication rate is as high as 75 percent in paediatric patients, with the need for vaginal dilation due to narrowing being the most common complication.
