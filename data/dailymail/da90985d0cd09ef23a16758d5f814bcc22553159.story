A Japanese man who has perfected the art of moving like a monkey smashed his own world record for sprinting on all fours.

Kenichi Ito covered 100m on his arms and legs in just 16.87 seconds, improving by more than half a second on his 2012 record of 17.47 seconds.

Mr Ito, 30, has been training for more than a decade, and has dedicated himself to studying how primates move.

Technique: Mr Ito studies videos of monkeys and visits zoos to enhance his technique

He supplements his rigorous training with watching videos of monkeys and making zoo visits to hone his technique.

In a bid to become even more of a natural on all fours, he has taken to moving on his arms and legs in everyday life, and one day hopes that it will become an official track and field event.

Carlos Martinez, an official adjudicator for Guinness World Records, was on hand to witness the attempt and announced afterward that Ito had set a record.

However, he still has some way to go before matching more traditional upright sprinters. The current 100m record is held by Usian Bolt, who covered 100m in 9.58 seconds.

He would have even more trouble matching the all-time record for animals running 100m after a cheetah clocked in at 5.95 seconds, reaching a top speed of 61mph.
