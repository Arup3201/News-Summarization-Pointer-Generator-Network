It’s cricket mating season in Oklahoma and unusually massive swarms of the frisky bugs are terrorizing the state’s residents.

Not only does the field cricket have a noxious odor and shrieking chirp, it has a tendency toward cannibalism so killing them only makes things worse.

Residents say the insects tend to congregate and feed on carcasses of their dead brethren, but they’re covering every street, sidewalk, and building so there’s no way to avoid the occasional crunch.

They're everywhere: Unusually large swarms of crickets are invading Oklahoma, covering streets, sidewalks, and businesses like this McDonalds

Pile-up: The crickets are difficult to control, noisy, smelly and are pouring into towns across the Sooner State. Instagram user furiousd caught this particularly nasty pile of cricket carcasses

The more they’re stomped, worse infestations around homes and businesses become.

‘I think we are going to see a little more before it gets any better,’ Oklahoma State University’s Brian Jervis told KTUL.

Experts say weather could be the cause of the usually large swarm.

‘These outbreaks seem to occur after periods of prolonged dry weather in spring and early summer followed by rainfall in July and August,’ said Rick Grantham, director of the Plant Disease and Insect Diagnostic Lab in Oklahoma State University. ‘Extensive soil cracking may be an important factor.’

Bad year: The crickets come out every year, but the weather allowed an unusually large number to emerge from their burrows to mate this season. Here, the critters congregate at a gas station.

Unavoidable: A thick carpet of the field crickets can be found all across Oklahoma on streets, sidewalks, and buildings and stepping on them only attracts more

Cannibals: Experts say the crickets are attracted to the bodies of their dead relatives, so crushing the bugs only makes the problem worse. Here, a pile up can be seen near a shady set of stairs.

'A plague has arrived': According to Rick Grantham of Oklahoma State University's Entymology department. adult crickets can be very difficult to control

Field crickets are found throughout the Southern, Eastern, and Plains states, but Oklahoma has a special relationship with the chirping creature.

At the end of every summer, the the inch-long crickets come out en masse to mate in the Sooner State.

July and August rains likely trigger this emergence, but experts are saying this year's population explosion is the result of a particularly nasty drought followed by an unusually moist wet season.

When residents try to squash the bugs, things can get even worse.

According to Oklahoma State University's Brian Jervis, other crickets swarm the bodies of the fallen comrades for a cannibalistic feast.

The current brood will eventually die off once they've all mated. But not before they've laid eggs into the ground, thus planting the seed for next year's generation.

Unfortunately for Oklahoma residents, that won't happen for a while yet.

Experts say this year's onslaught will likely last longer than usual and the state must still endure around 8 more weeks of the chirping plague.

The crickets lay their eggs and crawl out en masse once it’s time for mating.

And though the creatures can be tough to get rid of, experts suggest a few tricks that might ease the problem somewhat.

‘Crickets commonly spend the daylight hours hiding in dark, damp areas. Eliminating piles of bricks, stones, wood or other debris around the home will help reduce numbers,’ said Grantham. ‘aerosols applied to baseboards, door thresholds and cracks and crevices where crickets hide will normally control them.’

In addition to incessant chirping that can last deep into the night and early morning, some residents say the crickets even stink.

'After a while they all start dying and it gets to get this rotted meat smell,' one resident told KFOR.

'I will not be sleeping tonight': The crickets stick to walls, crunch underfoot wherever residents walk, and hang from walls and window screens, making just looking outside a little bit creepy

Invasion of crickets! 'These outbreaks seem to occur after periods of prolonged dry weather in spring and early summer followed by rainfall in July and August,' said Grantham

Thick as thieves: The crickets like to congregate in damp, cool places and experts say to remove debris that could offer such environs from around your home. 'Large amounts of crickets are gross!' says Instagram user xnebulousxz

They eventually die back, but that won’t be for another eight weeks or so.

‘I think we are going to see a little more before it gets any better,’ Jervis said.

In the meantime, all residents are left to do is complain and post nauseating photos to their social media streams.
