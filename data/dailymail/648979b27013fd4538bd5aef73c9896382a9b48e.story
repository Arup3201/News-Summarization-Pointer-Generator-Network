Cameron's new law has been branded a flop after fewer than half of convicted knife thugs have been sent to prison

A law brought in by David Cameron to jail knife thugs was exposed as a flop yesterday after fewer than half of those convicted were sent to prison.

Critics say the supposedly tough new crime of ‘aggravated’ knife possession is simply being ignored by the courts.

Justice Secretary Chris Grayling last night promised to hold talks with senior judges about whether further guidance was needed to ensure serious knife offenders were sent to prison.

Two years ago, the Prime Minister announced that courts would be forced to put knife thugs in jail for between six months and four years if they threatened the public.

Mr Cameron said: ‘Far too many people still think they can go out armed with a knife. We need to send the clearest possible message that this simply has to change.’

The move was an attempt to mollify campaigners furious at the ditching of a Tory manifesto pledge to jail anyone caught carrying a knife.

That policy was ruled out as too costly because it would have meant jailing up to 8,000 people.

The less stringent offence of aggravated knife possession – which applies to those carrying knives who behave threateningly – came into force on December 3 last year.

But figures released by the Ministry of 
Justice yesterday show that in the first six months of this year, 63 
people were found guilty of the offence, of whom just 27 were sent to 
jail.

Eight received a suspended sentence, 17 were given community punishments, four were let off with a caution and seven have been convicted but not yet sentenced because they are being tried for other offences.

Last night, Mr Grayling said he was disappointed that so few knife offenders had been sent to jail, adding: ‘I am clear people convicted of aggravated knife possession should be going to prison.

‘Whilst sentencing in individual cases is a matter for the courts I will consider with the senior judiciary whether any further guidance may be necessary.’

A breakdown of the figures shows that 12 of those convicted of threatening someone with a knife were aged ten to 15. Two of these were locked up, eight were given community sentences and two received a reprimand.

A further ten were aged 16 and 17, six of whom were sentenced to immediate custody and the remainder given a community sentence.

Forty-one of those convicted were adults, of whom 19 went to jail, eight received a suspended sentence, five a community sentence and two a caution. Seven are due to be sentenced at a later date.

Labour justice spokesman Sadiq Khan said: ‘David Cameron was very clear before the election that anyone caught in possession of a knife would face a prison sentence.

‘He needs to explain to the people who voted for him on the back of this explicit promise why it has been broken.’
