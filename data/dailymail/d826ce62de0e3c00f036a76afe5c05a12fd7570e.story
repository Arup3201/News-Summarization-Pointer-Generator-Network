Gareth Bale's future at Real Madrid was thrown into more doubt after his white Bentley was attacked by abusive supporters.

The Spanish club acted swiftly on Monday night by identifying those responsible. A club statement said that three men had been involved and that one was a club member who would now be banned for life. 

The £80million former Tottenham forward, who has been linked with a return to the Premier League in the summer, was accosted driving away from the club’s training ground in the early hours of Monday morning after arriving back in Madrid following the 2-1 defeat in Barcelona.

Two men tried to stop Bale, kicking out at his car as he sped away from them without stopping.

The men shouted ‘Hijo de puta’ (‘Son of a bitch’) at the player as security guards attempted to calm them down.

Bale's team-mates Jese and Sergio Ramos were also targeted.

Bale has been singled out by Real supporters since the turn of the year as the team have lost three games in the league. 

On Monday, Real announced that the offending member's identity has been sent to the club's discipline commission with the request for him to be expelled from the Santiago Bernabeu outfit for the 'very serious offence.'

In addition the club say that they will take applicable legal action against the individuals responsible for the incident.

On their official club website, Real Madrid's statement read: 'Following the incidents that occurred involving three individuals in the early hours of this morning outside Ciudad Real Madrid, Real Madrid C. F. wishes to outline the following:

1.- The Club has already identified the individuals responsible, one a Real Madrid member, for these aggressive and violent actions against several of our players.

2.- Details of this member's identity were sent to the Club's Discipline Commission, requesting that it expel the individual from Real Madrid for what is considered a very serious offence.

3.- This afternoon, the Discipline Commission held an emergency meeting and decided to open a disciplinary investigation and provisionally suspend the individual's rights as a member and access to the Santiago Bernabéu or any Real Madrid facilities.

4.- Real Madrid has notified Spain's National Anti-Violence Commission of the incidents that took place, as well as the identities of the individuals responsible, requesting that it apply those sanctions that it considers appropriate.

5.- Furthermore, Real Madrid will take any applicable legal action against the individuals responsible for these incidents.' 

Spanish newspaper AS refused to give Bale a mark in their ratings for the Barca defeat, while Marca wrote: 'It's obvious [president Florentino] Perez has paid €100m for someone worth €20m.'

Bale was unlucky not to score at the Nou Camp in front of an estimated 400 million watchers on television as his first-half goal was ruled out for Cristiano Ronaldo being offside. 

The Wales international, despite helping Madrid win the Copa del Rey and Champions League by scoring in both finals last season, has found life difficult in Spain this year. 

Bale scored both goals in a 2-0 win against Levante  less than two weeks ago, and celebrated ending his 829-minute drought by covering his ears as if to block out the criticism.

The corner flag received a kicking from the 25-year-old, too, as he let out his frustration. 

It came after the former Tottenham Hotspur winger was whistled at his own stadium last month and a fan poll that found 40 per cent of supporters wanted Bale to be dropped by manager Carlo Ancelotti.

Bale has been linked with moves to Manchester United and Chelsea previously, with the majority of Madrid fans seemingly hoping he decides to return to the Barclays Premier League.
