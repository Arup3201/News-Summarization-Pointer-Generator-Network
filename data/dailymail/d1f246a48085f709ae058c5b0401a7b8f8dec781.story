If Hollywood hasn't already come calling, it's surely only a matter of time.

In this show-stopping video, Jumpy the border collie shows he's got the pedigree for a stunt-dog career by performing an astounding 25 tricks in only two minutes.

The multi-talented mutt from Miami lists skateboarding, diving and backflipping to catch a frisbee among his many talents.

Catch! Jumpy uses his trainer as a springboard to grab a frisbee in his mouth mid-backflip

Jumpy lives up to his name by making a leap of faith towards his owner

The two-year-old shows he knows how to meet and greet and respond to his name with a bark.

He can summon his trainer with a 'let's go' whine and nod of the head, and even goes a little shy when praised for how good he is by putting a paw over his eyes in a show of modesty.

He even shows off his cheeky side by obeying when told to 'go pee on Mommy', but thankfully he only cocks his leg up and knows not to go any further.

Jumpy has previously shown off his tricks on tour with the canine cast of Dogs: The Incredible Dog show.

The performances show off the animals' close bond with their trainers while promoting the adoption of rescue dogs from shelters.

The show's website says Jumpy weighs 
2.8stone (40lb) and he's certainly light on his feet when his instructor commands him to walk slow, or walk tall on his hind legs.

The pair clearly have a close relationship with Jumpy looking thrilled to show off for his master.
