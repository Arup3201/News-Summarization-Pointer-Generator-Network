Police have released dramatic footage of a masked thief tripping and spilling cups full of coins as he flees the scene of his gang's latest armed raid on clubs and gaming venues.

In other scenes from the brazen robbery in suburban Melbourne, the bandits can be seen waving large knives, assaulting patrons and ordering people to lie on the ground and smashing glass screens before making off with money from the cash registers.

Detectives say the same Middle Eastern gang has targeted six premises in or around the city and have released the footage in a bid to catch them before they strike again.

Armed Crime Squad Detective Inspector Stephen Clark said the robberies, committed in the past three months, are believed to have netted the gang more than $100,000 so far.

'It appears at this stage that the armed robberies have been committed by the same Middle Eastern crime syndicate,' Detective Inspector Clark said.

'On each occasion the offenders, who we believe are aged between 16 and 25-years, were armed with a firearm and an edged weapon and threatened staff.

'We have seen the number of men involved in each incident has varied from two to four and they seem to enter the venue with no regard to who or how many people may be there.'

The gang struck at venues in Laverton, Epping, Thomastown, Kealba, Fawkner and Moonee Ponds between June 2 and August 11.

Police have charged two people aged 16 and 21 with armed robbery earlier this month, according to ABC.
