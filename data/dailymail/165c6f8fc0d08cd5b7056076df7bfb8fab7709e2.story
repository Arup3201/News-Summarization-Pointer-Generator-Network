Former European light-middleweight champion Jamie Moore admits he thought his time was up after being shot twice in Marbella last month.

The Salford native was attacked in the Spanish town, where he had been training Birmingham middleweight Matthew Macklin, and left for dead.

However, the 35-year-old defied the odds to survive the ordeal and is back in Manchester on the road to recovery.

But Moore says he feared the worst when he collapsed in a pool of blood on August 3. 

He recalls: 'I thought: "I'm not going to make this". I thought I was finished and it's the emptiest, most horrible feeling ever. I felt helpless and lonely – lying on a driveway at night bleeding to death. I thought: "I can't die here … how am I going to leave my kids with no dad?"

'Considering the circumstances,' Moore told the Guardian, 'I was really calm. It all relates back to boxing and staying calm under pressure. It instils discipline and composure. I could have easily panicked and stood up and I would have bled even more then.

'A woman came on and I said: 'I've been shot. I'm at a house in Estepona but I don't know the address." 

'She needed the address but I said: "If you don't trace my phone I'll die. I'm bleeding really badly." So she got on to the police and they traced my phone. She was telling me to stem the blood and try and stay conscious. I was trying, but I was in and out.

'It was 25 minutes before the ambulance got there – and I remember saying to the woman in the back: 'Please don't let me die …'
