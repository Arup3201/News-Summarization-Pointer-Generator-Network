The widow of the pizza delivery man who was killed by a ex-convict who was accidentally released early from prison four years early is furious with authorities for dismissing his death as a 'clerical error.'

Police believe that Evan Spencer Ebel killed Domino's Pizza delivery man Nathan Leon in Denver just days before he killed Colorado prison chief Tom Clements.

Leon's widow said that the impersonal apology from the state- that Leon's family only heard about through the media - wouldn't cut it for the death of her husband and the father of her twin girls.

Victim: Nathan Leon, left, was shot by Evan Spencer Ebel, a convict that was accidentally released early from prison and now Leon's widow Katherine (right) is speaking out for the first time

Heartbroken: Mrs Leon said that she doesn't know what to tell her twin daughters who lost their father because of a 'clerical error' that let a felon go free far too early

Happier days: Katherine and Nathan Leon, seen here on their wedding day, have twin girls who are 4-years-old

'It ain't going to bring Tom Clements
back. It's not going to bring my children's father back. How do I tell 
my 4-year-olds, "Daddy was murdered because of a clerical error"? 
Katherine Leon said.

Worrying: Officials said that Evan Spencer Ebel, pictured, was released from jail in January four years early

Officials said yesterday that Ebel's previous felony conviction had been inaccurately recorded and his release in January was a mistake.

In 2008, Ebel pleaded guilty to 
assaulting a prison officer. As part of the plea deal, Ebel was to be 
sentenced to up to four additional years in prison, to be served after 
he completed the eight-year sentence that put him behind bars in 2005, 
according to a statement from Colorado's 11th Judicial District.

However, the judge did not say the sentence was meant to be 'consecutive,' or in addition to, Ebel's current one.

So
the court clerk recorded it as one to be served 'concurrently' or at 
the same time. That's the information that went to the state prisons, 
the statement said.

On January 28, prisons officials saw 
that Ebel had finished his court-ordered sentence and released him. They
said they had no way of knowing the plea deal was intended to keep Ebel
behind bars for years longer.

On March 21, Ebel was killed following 
a  shootout with authorities in Texas. The gun he used in the gun battle
was the same one used to shoot and kill Mr Clements two days earlier.

Victims: Police believe Ebel also was involved in the death of a Domino's Pizza delivery man, Nathan Leon, left, in Denver. Prisons chief Tom Clements  right, was also believed to have been killed by Ebel

Irate: An emotional Mrs Leon said that she never even received a phone call of condolence from the Department of Corrections

'The court regrets this oversight and 
extends condolences to the families of Mr. Nathan Leon and Mr. Tom 
Clements,' said a statement signed by Charles Barton, chief judge of the
11th Judicial District, and court administrator Walter Blair.

The statement, which Mrs Leon says they never were given directly, does not assuage any of their anger over the situation.

Injured: Evan Spencer Ebel was first pulled over by Montague County Sheriff's Deputy James Boyd, pictured, before he was shot by police in the Texas shootout

'We want to know who is going to 
stand up and be accountable. I don't mean by saying we send condolences.
Who is going to stand up and be accountable to my daughter? To my 
grandchildren,' her mother and Nathan's mother-in-law told local station
9News.

'He was the greatest person I ever had the pleasure of meeting,' widow Katherine Leon said.

The court officials vowed to review their procedures to ensure the error isn't repeated.

'We commend both the 11th Judicial District and the DOC for 
reviewing their own internal processes and procedures,' Governor John 
Hickenlooper's spokeswoman Megan Castle said in a written statement.

The attack that led to the plea deal took place in 2006. According to prison and court records, Ebel slipped out of handcuffs while being transferred from a cell and punched a prison officer in the face. He bloodied the officer's nose and finger, and threatened to kill the officer's family.

'If Mr. Ebel was prosecuted for an assault on an officer, it had to be pretty severe, because in the course of day-to-day work, correctional officers are regularly assaulted or threatened,' said Pueblo County Commissioner Buffie McFadyen, who is executive director of the correctional officer group Corrections U.S.A.

'It sounds like a horrific 
oversight,' she said of the mistake that led to Ebel's release this 
year. 'It's a tragic clerical error.'

Ebel
spent much of his time behind bars in solitary confinement and had a 
long record of disciplinary violations. Records show he joined a white 
supremacist prison gang.

Ebel's
early release was just the latest twist in a case full of painful 
ironies. His father is friends with Hickenlooper and had testified 
before the Colorado Legislature about the damage solitary confinement 
did to his son. Clements was worried about that very issue.

Hickenlooper
raised the case with Clements when the governor hired him to come to 
Colorado in 2011. The Democratic governor said he never mentioned Ebel's
name and the inmate received no special treatment.WATCH THE VIDEO HERE
