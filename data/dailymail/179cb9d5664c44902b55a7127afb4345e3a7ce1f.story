A man has landed an 11-foot, 809-pound Mako shark - using a bow and arrow.

Jeff Thomason, host of hunting show Predator Pursuit, only had one shot to strike the record-sized fish.

He spent 30 minutes coaxing it towards his boat off the coast of Los Angeles, California, before opening fire.

Finally, he took aim and struck the shark through the back.

Five crew members were needed to haul the fish back to shore.

And after weighing it, Thomason learned he had broken a bowfishing world record by 300 pounds.

He then donated 400 pounds of the meat to a homeless shelter nearby. 

'It was one of those days when everything went right,' the Texan angler told Lone Star Outdoor News of the event on August 27.

Mako sharks are notoriously hard to catch as they are the fastest sharks in the world, with a top swimming speed of 60mph and an average of 35mph.

They are known to viciously attack people and animals.

Bowfishing is an ancient practice dating back to the Filipino Negritos, who shot freshwater fish with barbed arrows from canoes.

Now, anglers used specialized archery equipment to catch their targets. 

The complex practise requires fishermen to be within feet of the selected fish, and many anglers spend years studying the best angle to shoot from - and where to aim.

'They've got to be about three feet from the boat to get the arrow to stick, so we threw a fish on a line and teased him to the boat,' Thomason told Lone Star Outdoor News. 

'I try and shoot for the top of the back. As soon as the arrow hit, all hell broke loose. 

'We freaked out because I spined him and we thought he might sink.'

The largest Mako shark ever caught weighed 1,221 pounds and was landed using a rod and reel off the coast of Massachusetts in 2001.
