Northampton produced a mighty finale to topple arch-rivals Leicester in a thundering Premiership semi-final on Friday night.

A try two minutes from time by England flanker Tom Wood gave Northampton a Twickenham final later this month after Leicester had led 17-6 at half-time.

Northampton did it the hard way after they had prop Salesi Ma’afu sent off for flooring  England hooker Tom Youngs 17 minutes into the second half.

Wood, who crashed over wide out on the left, sent Northampton’s fans delirious as their team ended a four-year period without a win over champions Leicester.

‘That was the most intense match I’ve 
ever played in,’ he said afterwards. ‘We left it late but we got the job
 done. That was a proper game. It was so physical and credit to the 
Leicester lads for making it as hard as it was.’

The
 last-gasp victory was  delivered by 14 men after Ma’afu was dismissed 
in brawl which also brought a yellow card for Youngs from referee JP 
Doyle.

Youngs was one of 
three Leicester players to be sin binned and their director of rugby 
Richard Cockerill admitted his team’s lack of discipline cost them.

‘The
 penalty count speaks for itself,’ he said. ‘It was nearly double 
theirs. The indiscipline cost us. Dan’s yellow card gave them the 
impetus and we could not get out of our own half.’

Jim
 Mallinder, Northampton’s director of rugby, said: ‘I think we deserved 
it. We were down at half-time but we kept moving their front five around
 and to turn it around was a massive testament to the character of the 
side.’

These two 
arch-rivals would have a fierce tussle even if the only thing at stake 
was local bragging rights. Over the past five years these contests, 
dominated by Leicester’s success, have become hugely intense, heightened
 by the large number of England players involved.

Over the top: Ma'afu delivers an overhand left onto Youngs' chin, that gets him sent off

Crunch: Youngs is powerless as powerful Ma'afu clocks him on the chin

Off: Referee JP Doyle is given no choice but to show Ma'afu a red card, meaning he'll miss the final

Manu
 Tuilagi has spent most of the season watching the rise of Northampton’s
 Luther Burrell while the Leicester centre recovered from a torn 
pectoral muscle. He had already rocked Burrell backwards in the move 
which led to him finishing off a smart attack which put Leicester in 
charge.

Mat Tait’s half 
break, which was followed by him gaining valuable metres on the floor, 
cracked open the Northampton line, allowing fly half Toby Flood to work a
 big overlap on the right.

Flood kicked the conversion to add to his seventh-minute kick which had put Leicester in front.

Stephen
 Myler equalised in the 21st minute as Northampton enjoyed their best 
period of the half thanks to the inventiveness of scrum-half Kahn 
Fotuali’i.

His running power had helped earn the penalty by catching out the Leicester defence as they trundled backwards.

In the same period, a try by Phil Dowson was ruled out by the referee for a dummy jump before the ball was thrown in.

Breakthrough: England centre Tuilagi get the final touch on a slick backline move for the Tigers

Try-saver: Saints Kahn Fotuali'i is cut down short of the try line by an outstanding Matthew Tait tackle

The
 disallowed try looked to be a crucial turning point as, apart from 
another kick by Myler following a sin bin offence for Goneva in the 29th
 minute, the rest of the half went Leicester’s way.

After
 Tuilagi had nimbly finished off for the opening try, Leicester’s second
 came from blunt forward power. Prop Logovi’i Mulipola stormed forward 
off a line-out and Leicester camped on the Northampton line. Ben Youngs,
 who needs no second invitation to use his pace and power, darted over.

Flood
 added the conversion and Leicester turned round 17-6 and looked in 
control. But Northampton came out swinging and, despite the loss of 
Ma’afu for his punching of Youngs, the home team dominated the half.

All-in: A melee breaks out on the sideline in a predictably spirited affair between the old rivals

A
 third penalty from Myler in the 46th minute rewarded early pressure in 
the half before the match exploded when Ma’afu and Youngs traded blows. 
Northampton kept on the pressure and worked North over for a try in the 
65th off a well-executed move. Myler converted to cut Leicester’s 
deficit to 16-17.

Owen Williams, who had replaced Toby Flood, edged Leicester further ahead at 20-16 thanks to a 65th-minute penalty.

But
 Northampton returned to the attack and the pressure eventually forced 
Leicester’s defence to crack when Wood finished on the left. Myler, who 
had contributed 11 points, missed the conversion but the one-point 
advantage was enough to seal a famous win.
