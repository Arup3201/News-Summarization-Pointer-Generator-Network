Twitter users accused the former midfielder/striker of sexism after the posts on Tuesday morning

In a series of posts on Tuesday morning, Peacock also claimed that God had designed marriage to ensure 'male headship and female submission'.

More tweets read: 'Husbands: one of your primary duties in loving your wife is to feed her with the Word of God daily.

'God's divine design for marriage in male headship and female submission is complementary not competitive.'

Peacock scored 108 goals in an 18-year professional career, before briefly working with the BBC and Chelsea's official website with media work.

'Football was my god as a youngster,' he says. 'But it ultimately didn't satisfy. I was empty.'

A Christian from the age of 18, he then told the Express last year that he answered a religious calling to take up full-time Ministry after his playing days were over, and is now preaching at the Calvary Grace Church in Canada.

'I started doing some preliminary Old and New Testament studies,' he said. 'I knew then I was being called to it full-time. I call it my joyful compulsion. I love it, but I must do it. 

'Football was my god as a youngster. All I wanted to do was follow my dad Keith and play football.

'But it ultimately didn't satisfy. I was empty.'
