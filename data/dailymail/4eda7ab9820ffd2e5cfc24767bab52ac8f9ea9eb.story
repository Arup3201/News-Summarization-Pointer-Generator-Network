A would-be carjacker got a taste of street justice when he tried to steal a vehicle with a woman and child inside, after a group of passers-by rushed to her aid, dragging him away and holding him down until the police arrived.

Ismael Hernandez, 21, is accused of getting into the car in a San Diego shoppers car park and attempting to drive off with the owner and her child still inside before crashing into a pole.

Video of the incident shows a group of men standing around the car hauling Hernandez out of the driver's seat and grabbing hold of the keys.
