In seven of 15 Premier League games this season, Arsenal have conceded a goal from the opposition's first shot on target.

It is the shocking statistic contributing to Arsene Wenger's unravelling season.

Saturday's calamitous 3-2 loss at Stoke was no exception, with Peter Crouch putting the Potters ahead inside one minute.

The Britannia loss saw the Gunners' tumultuous campaign plunge to new depths, with Wenger's future never been under more scrutiny.

Arsenal share the dubious honour of conceding the most first shots on target with QPR, also on seven.

Tottenham Crystal Palace and Stoke have seen the first shot against them go in six times, while Southampton pip Chelsea to the least games, conceding one first shot on target to Jose Mourinho's side's two.

It is a damning indictment of the way in which Arsenal set up for games, their defensive capabilities and their goalkeeper situation.

Injury to Wojciech Szczesny has seen Damian Martinez between the posts for the last three matches.

However, Martinez had conceded just one goal before Saturday's capitulation, indicating the vast majority of the shots conceded were on the Pole’s watch.

Starting games has been a perennial problem for the Arsenal, who have failed to score in the first half of any of their last six matches.

The earliest of the Gunners' last 10 league goals came in the 60th minute - Danny Welbeck's winner at West Brom last month.

Stoke-on-Trent train station was the scene for a group of Arsenal fans berating Wenger as the mananger and his side boarded to head back to London.

Amid a cacophany of booing, one fan shouted 'get out of my club.'

Differences over Wenger's future have caused fractions in Arsenal's support, with one banner hoisted displaying the message 'Arsene, thanks for the memories but it's time to say goodbye.'

Next up for the under-fire manager is a Champions League trip to Galatasaray, with the Gunners bidding to better Borussia Dortmund's result and finish as the leaders of Group D.
