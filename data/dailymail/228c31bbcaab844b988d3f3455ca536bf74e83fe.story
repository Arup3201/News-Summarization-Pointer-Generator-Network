For 20 years, Dave McGuire felt he was living the life of someone else while battling a crippling addiction that drove him to have sex every day with both men and women, and led to the eventual breakdown of his marriage.

The former quantitative analyst - who worked on the Wall Street financial district in New York and then in the film industry - would visit sex clubs, peep shows, adult book stores and video arcades, massage parlours, watch pornography and people on the street to keep himself in a constantly aroused state.

Mr McGuire's addiction started in his teenage years when he was asking his older peers to buy him pornography and his 20s and 30s it escalated and started impacting on his every day life.

Dave McGuire battled an addiction with sex for more than 20 years but now he is helping other overcome their addictions

'At the height of my addiction, I had to have sex daily,' Mr McGuire said.

'I was sexually compulsive not always with a partner...there was daily masturbation and pornography.

'After a while, it didn’t matter who I was acting out with [men or women], it was about getting the sexual charge.

'I would act out in groups of people as well as individuals. I would act out in book stores where they sold pornography or in clubs that were geared towards sexual behaviours like sex clubs.'

'When I was crossing the boundaries of my sexual orientation, it heightened the high of my addiction.'

Like many who battle the addiction, Mr McGuire's obsession with sex grew from tragic circumstances.

'I feel like my addiction had its birth in my early teenage existence from sexual abuse,' he said.

'Not all born from that but many are.

'My abuse took place between ages 12 and 14 and it was with a parish priest.

'I was alter boy when it started and he was a friend of the family.'

Mr McGuire believes his addiction to sex started when he was in his teenage years after he was sexually abuse by a priest

Years later the priest married he and his ex-wife when he was 23 years old.

'I was in deep denial about my abuse...this is how sick the priest was,' Mr McGuire said.

But Mr McGuire was no stranger to addictions at that point.

For years, he had also been battling substance and alcohol abuse, which only became obvious to him during his marriage.

'It took someone else's eyes to say to me: "You have got to cut this out",' Mr McGuire said.

'At 23 years old, I got sober from drugs and alcohol.

'But my sex addiction was still active, I didn’t know it was a sex addiction.

'I was still watching pornography daily and peep shows in Manhattan were a regular stop off for me after work, which escalated to me using massage parlours and sex workers and prostitutes.

'I got by in the day by saying "At the end of the day, I could look forward to this".'

Mr McGuire's denial of his sex addiction eventually led to his marriage break down three years later.

He said he felt like he was living two separate lives.

'In the history of my sex addiction there wasn’t a lot of acting out with my wife,' Mr McGuire said.

'It was a complete disruption in our intimacy.

'I was showing up in the marriage and at work as if I was one person and behind it all I knew I was somebody else.

'So I could really not be connected with [my wife], I was pretending.'

Mr McGuire darkest moments during his sex addiction would come after he 'acted out' his sexual compulsions.

He recalls a time when his girlfriend at the time found a sex trade magazine in their apartment that was filled with escort advertisements and confronted him about it.

'It was terrible seeing the hurt on her face,' he said.

'She said: "What the hell is this doing here? What is going on with you? Have you been lying to me all the time?"

'I knew exactly what it was but I still tried to lie by saying: "That must have been in the apartment before we even moved in", because I had to stash it somewhere.

'But all she had to do was look at the date of publication on the magazine [to get the truth].'

Mr McGuire finally had sought help when he 'ran out of options'.

In the past, he had tried to 'cure' himself of his addiction by using techniques he took away from 12-step programs he had used to kick his substance and alcohol abuse.

'I was not able to stop under my own will power,' he said.

'Finally I was able to admit I was defeated that I needed more specialised help.'

When he was younger Mr McGuire also battled addiction to a variety of substances

About 30-40 percent of the clientele who come through The Cabin are Australian, according to the US-born psychotherapist

'I was living in a brothel and using drugs, and my girlfriend was a sex worker. I remember standing at the front of the brothel at the metal gates and I remember standing looking at people going off to work in the morning and I had this insight.

'I felt like I was imprisoned by addiction, stuck in this brothel and addicted to sex and drugs.

'Living in the brothel took place in the summer / fall of 2001. It was an unassuming house in Elmhurst, Queens. I lived there from around July thru September.

'You could say that when the New York World Trade Centre came down, so did the structure of any kind of life I had. It was shortly after 9-11 that my brother and sister intervened and I was flown from New York to Los Angeles by them to enter rehab.

'My drug addiction was multi-substance. I was addicted to alcohol, marijuana, painkillers (Vicodin), benzodiazepines (Xanax), Heroin (for a short period of time) but mostly I was smoking Freebase (crack) cocaine in the height of my drug and sex addiction.'

And it was from this experience, Mr McGuire now helps those who have an addiction to sex.

While trying to educate himself about how to heal himself, he went back to school to get his master's degree in psychology.

He said more people needed to acknowledge sex was an addiction because then people would be more comfortable coming forward

After his life fell apart he went back to study to get his masters degree in psychology

'I didn’t really at that time have a career as a psychologist or psychiatrist,' Mr McGuire said.

'In practicum, once I started working with people who needed help and actually saw the effect I was having and helping people be happier, something lit up inside me and the feedback I was getting, I thought ‘Maybe this was something I should be doing'.

'It made me feel like my dark past could be used for something good.'

Mr McGuire is now a psychotherapist and sex addiction counsellor at a Thai rehabilitation facility, The Cabin Chiang Mai, where he treats celebrities, athletes, high-profile businessmen and politicians.

He said 30 to 40 per cent of the clientele at the clinic were Australians.

He said he still faces struggles to this day, but is much more aware of how to manage any addictive behaviour.

'Even if I am in a committed healthy relationship and if I am having sex more than four or five times a week I need to be careful. I need to gear the intimacy a bit so I’m not ramping up the addiction. 

'For me, each person develops this with themselves, for me my bottom line is not paying for sex and having sex with people I have an level of intimacy with – so not having anonymous sex.

He described his addiction to drug as multi-substance and used alcohol, marijuana, painkillers (Vicodin), benzodiazepines (Xanax), Heroin and Freebase (crack) cocaine

Mr McGuire urged people to get help if they believed they needed it and not to live with the discomfort of addiction

'I’m not just using their body to get off on. For many people, porn is also completely off the table.'

'If any of my story resonates with you then by all means seek help,' Mr McGuire continued.

'If you or a loved one is showing any signs that the behaviour is becoming out of control then there is help available.

'Even if you are simply questioning the behaviour, we have assessment tools available to help answer the question.

'You don’t have to live with the discomfort your behaviour is causing you.'

Mr McGuire said more people needed to acknowledge sex was an addiction because then people would be more comfortable coming forward.

'The longer society stays in denial over the severity of the issue, the longer people will suffer unnecessarily,' he said.

'In the same way that society was in denial over the sexual abuse problems we are now addressing, people were suffering in secrecy and now there are opportunities for healing available.'
