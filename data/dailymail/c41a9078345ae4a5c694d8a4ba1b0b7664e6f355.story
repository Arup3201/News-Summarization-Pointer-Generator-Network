In the picture, posted on Lindegaard's Instagram account, the pair seemed in good spirits ahead of their Premier League match on New Year's Day.

Alongide the snap was a message stating, 'Gonna spend New Year's Eve in a hotel with @waynerooney and the lads... Happy days!'

Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal speaks during a press conference on Tuesday

United are a team on the up, and after manager Louis van Gaal's comments about what 2015 has in store, both fans and players will be smiling when the clock strikes midnight. 

'We are improving every week and we shall be better in 2015. Just watch,' the United manager said.

'We are still in a process. I think the players understand the philosophy, and that's why we are improving - but we can improve more when we have all the players available.

Manchester United have climbed up the table after a torrid start to the Premier League season 

'I think the fans were fantastic because we were in a moment with 10 matches and 13 points - that is not good, I think more weak than good.

'They have supported us is because of the fighting spirit of my team.'

After a poor start to the campaign, United now sit third in the Premier League ahead of their match against Stoke on Thursday.

The Potters themselves have won two on the bounce, against Everton and West Brom, and can enter the top half if they win and Newcastle fail to beat Burnley.
