A 20-year-old blew his head off after apparently trying to play Russian roulette on his own.

Bryan Javier Aguilera Soto had taken a Taurus .38 revolver and gone to visit a friend in Coquimbo, a city in the western Chilean province of Elqui, where he proposed playing the lethal game.

His friend unsurprisingly turned down the offer before walking out of the house. Moments later he heard a shot ring out as Mr Aguilera shot himself in the head.

Reckless: Bryan Javier Aguilera Soto, 20, who blew his own brains out playing Russian roulette on his own

He was rushed to the San Pablo de Coquimbo hospital but despite the best efforts of doctors was pronounced dead at 11.50pm on Saturday, hours after firing the fatal shot.

Russian roulette is a potentially lethal game of chance in which a player places a single round in a revolver, spins the cylinder, places the muzzle against his head, and pulls the trigger.

With a six-shooter revolver, players have in theory a one-in-six chance of blowing their brains out; but in practice the force of gravity will probably make the full chamber come to rest at the bottom of the cylinder, altering the odds in favour of the player.

The term 'Russian roulette' first appeared in a story of the same name by Georges Surdez, which describes Russian officers playing it in Romania in 1917, although it is claimed the game had been widely known in Russia since the early 19th century.

Mr Aguilera's death came as the Coquimbo region's chief of police, Colonel Julio Gordon, warned of the danger of having guns in homes precisely because they could fall into the hands of the young and reckless.

Days before Mr Aguilera's death he had launched a firearms amnesty in the city, asking any citizens with firearms to 'surrender your weapon' anonymously and with no legal repercussions.

Since Mr Aguilera's death it has emerged that the revolver he used was stolen from a neighbour, who was registered to own it.

A police spokesman said they are looking into the matter.
