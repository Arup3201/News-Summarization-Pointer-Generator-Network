On a hot summer day, when the sun is at its highest and the mercury is rising, there's nothing quite like taking a relaxing dip to cool down.

It's not too difficult to understand therefore why this bear was unable to resist the opportunity for a quick paddle after spotting a child's pool while roaming gardens in the San Gabriel Valley region of California.

Toshi Miyamoto told NBC Los Angeles that he started filming the scene after his three-year-old triplets spotted the bear relaxing in the pool in their garden on the 90F day.

The family watched, from behind the safety of a glass conservatory door, as the bear laid down and rolled around in the water.

The bear then got out of the pool before climbing over a fence and leaving the garden.

Bear sightings are not all that uncommon in certain parts of California.

In March last year, MailOnline reported how Justin Lee, of Monrovia, was at home when a baby bear let himself in through the dog flap.

Mr Lee, 25, immediately grabbed his dog, ran upstairs and locked himself in his room - but not before he took a couple of snaps of the cute, but dangerous, animal, who had a friend waiting by the door.

Mr Lee told ABC News: 'We are used to seeing bears outside of our home. They will come to our garden and backyard a lot, it is common in our city, and I've gotten used to seeing them these past two years.

'But when I saw them walk into our house, it was really scary and amusing at the same time.'

When he was safe in his room, Mr Lee said he called police who, once on the scene, found the uninvited guest had gotten bored and left to be with his companion.
