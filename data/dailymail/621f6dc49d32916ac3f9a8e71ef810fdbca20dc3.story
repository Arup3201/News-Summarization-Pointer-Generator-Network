Pro-hunting Labour MP Kate Hoey has launched a bid to stop David Cameron’s local hunt sacking the huntsman to the Chipping  Norton set.

The former Sports Minister is furious that the 176-year-old Heythrop hunt in the Cotswolds plans to oust employee Julian Barnfield.

Mr Barnfield, a friend of Mr Cameron, is being prosecuted by the RSPCA for illegal fox-hunting.

Ms Hoey, chairman of the Countryside Alliance, says if the hunt does not support professional huntsman Mr Barnfield in the run-up to the trial in the New Year, it could ‘damage’ the reputation of hunting across the country.

The court case, disclosed in The Mail on Sunday last month, is threatening to embarrass Mr Cameron, who has ridden with the hunt, because it will reopen political divisions over the pastime and increase pressure on Ministers to overturn Labour’s 2004 ban.

The row has also caused divisions in the Chipping Norton set – an influential group of MPs and media professionals who live close to the Oxfordshire market town.

Wealthy landowners, including Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson and Sir Anthony Bamford, chairman of the JCB excavator company, allow the hunt to ride through their woods and fields.

The issue could surface at next month’s annual £90-a-head black tie hunt ball at the home of former racing trainer Charlie Brooks and his wife Rebekah, the former chief executive of News International – who is at the centre of the phone-hacking scandal. 

The fate of Mr Barnfield, one of the country’s best-known professional huntsmen, is to be decided at an emergency general meeting just days before the ball.

Insiders are predicting a fierce backlash if a decision is made to remove the popular huntsman and they believe many hunt supporters would boycott the ball.

The row began after the current senior master of the hunt announced he was standing down next year, and the person chosen to replace him, Charles Frampton, said that he wanted also to take over the role of huntsman, who is in charge of the hounds during hunt meetings.

Miss Hoey and senior figures in the Countryside Alliance fear that such a move would undermine Mr Barnfield’s court case.

In a letter to Mikey Elliot, chairman of the Heythrop hunt, which has been leaked to The Mail on Sunday, she said:  ‘We must distinguish between the running of the hunt, which is your concern, and the public reputation and future of hunting as a whole, which is ours. 

‘We are concerned that to replace, demote or make redundant the defendant in this case, at this particular time, to be potentially damaging for the wider cause of hunting, and the very people upon whom we rely to keep hunting going.’

Mr Elliot, an arable farmer who is married to three-day eventer Ginny Leng, is backing Mr Frampton.

He said: ‘Julian has our full support in the legal action, but we needed  a new senior master who could organise the hunting and our seven full-time staff.’

Mr Barnfield declined to comment.
