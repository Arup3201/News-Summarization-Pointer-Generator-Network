Illegal immigrant Babar Khan, 24, spent thousands on a sham marriage but was caught out and jailed after staff noticed he couldn't spell the bride's name

An illegal immigrant who spent thousands of pounds on a sham marriage has been jailed after staff spotted he was unable to spell his bride's name.

Babar Khan, 24, of no fixed abode, had arranged for his big day to be held at Southampton Register Office, but police dramatically stormed the ceremony as the fake couple prepared to say their vows after officials became suspicious.

The Pakistani national paid £4,660 to marry the woman he barely knew in a desperate attempt to remain in Britain at a ceremony in front of just two guests.

Southampton Crown Court heard police officers who quizzed the couple found they gave  'wildly conflicting' accounts of how they met.

Police then searched Khan's home and discovered 'crib notes' with prepared answers about their 'history' together.

Khan was released on bail but in an attempt to evade being deported he fled to London - before the authorities caught him again.

Siobhan Linsley, prosecuting, told the court Khan was initially granted entry to Britain in September 2011 to study a three-year accountancy course in the capital.

But when he failed to attend classes, immigration officers ordered him to apply for an extension or leave by the following June.

Khan instead decided to pay the thousands of pounds for a sham marriage with a Southampton woman.

But on the couple's arrival at Southampton Register Office on April 14 this year staff became concerned, the court heard.

Miss Linsley said: 'He misspelt her name, they had no interest in seeing the room where it would take place and they were vague about details.'

The woman, who has not been named, is believed to have received £250 for her part in the deal.

Police who searched her home found no evidence of Khan ever living there.

After his arrest Khan was bailed and ran away to London where he was eventually re-arrested in September while working in a factory.

In mitigation barrister Jane Rowley stressed Khan was not the main organiser of the scam.

She said: 'He bitterly regrets his misguided action.

'His motivations to come here weren't just greed. He wanted to make a constructive life in Britain.'

Recorder Nicolas Gerasimidis said to Khan: 'This was a sham marriage and not genuine.

'You made the decision to stay in this country and went awol.

'You were burying your head in the sand to avoid the consequences of your actions.'

Khan, who admitted conspiring to breach immigration law and two counts of breaching marriage laws, was jailed for 20 months.

Following the completion of his sentence he will be deported to Pakistan.

The woman denies a charge of conspiracy to breach UK immigration law and is due to stand trial next year.
