Guests at a luxury spa hotel have complained after discovering they were sharing their break with asylum seekers.

Around 35 migrants were checked into the four star Daresbury Park Hotel in Warrington, Cheshire, at an estimated cost to the taxpayer of £2,000 a night for the group.

One disgruntled guest wrote on review site Trip Advisor: 'I cannot believe that we had to queue up with asylum seekers for our meals! If you want a soup kitchen atmosphere, with a little bit of intimidation thrown in, then this is the place to stay.

A review from one of the guests who was not happy about sharing their break with the asylum seekers

'As long as these poor refugees are getting full bed and board at this hotel at our expense, I think we will find somewhere else to spend our hard earned money.' 

The Daresbury is part of the Britannia hotel chain, owned by Alex Langsam. 

In October MailOnline reported that in a deal costing the taxpayer tens of thousands of pounds a week Mr Langsam is putting up hundreds of migrants in his chain of 47 hotels.

Another guest, part of a group of four women who stayed at the hotel, wrote: 'What we hadn't known about were the number of African male asylum seekers who were residing there.

'We could not book our evening meal because they had block booked the mid evening slots so we were offered either 5.30pm or 10pm.

'The WORST bit was the appraising looks and behaviour of these groups of men... not reassuring in a hotel.

'It was also clear that the staff were not supposed to discuss it.

'There were other groups of women out celebrating in their party outfits which these men clearly found interesting... very intimidating!!!'

The hotel is described on its website as 'vibrant and exciting', offering 24 hour room service, three course meals, gym and spa. 

The asylum seekers are waiting for the Home Office to decide if they can stay in the UK.

The Home Office says asylum seekers can be housed in hotels as a 'short term contingency measure'. 

In 2011/2012 the Home Office spent £150 million providing accommodation for asylum seekers.

Britannia have been contacted by MailOnline for a comment.
