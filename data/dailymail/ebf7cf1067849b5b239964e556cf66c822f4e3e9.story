Revelations: A government investigation has revealed half of all babies terminated for Down's syndrome are not recorded by doctors (file picture)

Half of all babies aborted for Down’s 
Syndrome are missing from official figures due to chaotic record-keeping
 in abortion clinics, a government investigation has revealed.

Doctors have broken the law by failing to keep proper records for the Department of Health on the reason for termination.

Many
 Down’s terminations are being wrongly recorded as ‘social’ abortions – 
which make up the bulk of terminations in this country – but other 
records are simply missing.

The
 investigation, published on the Department of Health website, shows 
that in 2012 a total of 994 babies were aborted for Down’s Syndrome, 
according to the independent National Down’s Syndrome Cytogenetic 
Register.

However, Department of Health figures recorded just 496 of these – meaning that 498 cases were classed as missing.

The
 investigation identified 11 of these cases as late abortions, over 24 
weeks, but in a further 107 cases the gestation of the baby was not 
known. In 47 cases, abortions for Down’s Syndrome were traced in the 
Department of Health figures, but other reasons had been given for the 
termination.

The NDSCR knows
 the correct figures because hospitals alert it every time a diagnosis 
of Down’s is made and it tracks cases to a birth or termination. 
Department of Health figures are compiled using abortion forms filled in
 by doctors.

The previous 
year’s data, for 2011, showed only 410 records on Down’s termination 
from the NDSCR could be matched by the Department of Health’s official 
records, when in fact 937 Down’s terminations took place.

As
 a growing number of women aged 40-plus become mothers, the number of 
Down’s Syndrome pregnancies is also increasing and better screening 
means the majority of cases are diagnosed before birth.

Under
 the Abortion Act, termination of a baby with Down’s Syndrome is legal 
right up to the point of delivery. Such terminations are hugely 
controversial because due to medical advances, children with Down’s can 
now expect to live until their fifties and sixties. Tory MP Fiona Bruce,
 chairman of the recent independent parliamentary inquiry into abortion 
for disability, said it was clear doctors had broken the law.

‘Worryingly, the department appears to have made no attempt to see that the law is properly enforced,’ she said.

‘We
 now know that nearly half of abortions for Down’s Syndrome were 
incorrectly recorded. How many doctors were referred for investigation? 
None.

‘Health ministers must act to restore public confidence in medical practitioners in this field.’

Professor
 Joan Morris, director of the NDSCR, said: ‘It has been very frustrating
 that people could pick up the official figures from the Department of 
Health, yet we all knew they were so inaccurate and there was no extra 
guidance to anyone to point them to the correct data.’

Under
 the Abortion Act a form must be completed by the doctor undertaking the
 termination and sent to the Chief Medical Officer within 14 days of the
 abortion.

Professor Morris 
said: ‘There is a form with a box to tick and there is no envelope 
provided. The doctor has to find the envelope and write the correct 
address on it. It is not a system designed to be easy in a busy clinical
 setting.’ Paul Danon, of the Pro-Life Alliance, said: ‘We oppose 
abortion on any grounds, but are particularly shocked by the 
discrepancies revealed in this Department of Health analysis.

‘It was horrifying to read that 11 Down’s Syndrome abortions post 24 weeks do not even appear in the official dataset.’

A
 Department of Health spokesman said: ‘Doctors have a legal duty to 
report all abortions, including those due to fetal anomalies, to the 
Chief Medical Officer.’

The 
spokesman added that the department was working with  the Royal College 
of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to tighten up the system.
