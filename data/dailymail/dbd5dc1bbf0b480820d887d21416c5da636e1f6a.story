CLICK HERE to read Martin Samuel's match report on heartbreak for City at the Allianz Arena  

Two or three minutes before the end of this game – shortly before Jerome Boateng's hammer blow put Manchester City on the seat of their pants – their midfielder Fernandinho crumpled to the ground with what appeared to be cramp in both calves.

It didn't last long but it was telling. The Brazilian had, after all, spent most of the night doing his own job and a fair share of the bloke's who was playing next to him.

The case of Yaya Toure and City is certainly a curious one. One of the Barclays Premier League champions' success stories, the Ivorian's standing at the Etihad Stadium is nevertheless not quite what it was.

Toure, at the age of 31, remains a formidable footballer. At full tilt at the front of one of City's rapier breaks from their own half, he can be imperious, almost unstoppable and as destructive as a lorry with its brake cables cut.

Nevertheless, football is about more than scoring and creating goals.

Even teams as blessed as City have to defend, even Europe's most gilded teams have to do their work without the ball. They have to have the appetite, the mobility and the lung capacity.

To look at Toure these days is to wonder about that part of the deal. When City do not have the ball, he can look laboured and slow to anticipate. Turning towards the opposition goal doesn't seem to be a problem whereas turning towards his own certainly does.

It would be wrong to question his desire.

Toure appeared to struggle against small, nimble footed players like Bayern Munich's Juan Bernat

Certainly he made an ass of himself in the summer with his self-indulgent moans about birthday cakes (the lack of) and a supposed (for that read 'imagined') lack of sympathy shown him by the club following the passing of his brother. Nevertheless, he remains a footballer committed to his role.

What is troubling is whether Toure can physically meet the challenge these days when City are forced deep in to their own half, confronted by intelligent, energetic footballers that come at you in numbers at places like the Allianz Arena and, closer to him, Stamford Bridge and Anfield.

Toure was playing at the Etihad Stadium last season when Chelsea swarmed all over the City midfield on their way to a victory in the Premier League. He looked lost that day and once again here last night he looked in trouble again, particularly in the first half.

Without Franck Ribery and Arjen Robben in their starting eleven last night, Bayern played rather differently. Their threat during an opening half hour they dominated came centrally via the nimble work of Thomas Muller, Xabi Alonso and Mario Gotze.

At this time Fernandinho badly needed Toure alongside him to track the runners and shield their central defenders from the red shirts.

Too often, Toure was slightly out of position or too slow to read the play. We are talking half a yard or a split second but, at this level and against these players, that is sometimes the difference between a goal and an attack snuffed out at source.

As the game wore on, Toure did improve. He was not even his team's worst player.

Twice towards half-time, Toure turned defence in to marauding attack with a sharp turn and a trundle upfield that allow City to impose their own attacking patterns on a Munich defence that did not always look terrible secure.

Toure is under even greater scrutiny after a summer punctuated by some ill-advised comments

Ultimately, though, Toure had questions asked of him on Wednesday night that he couldn' t always answer and his coach Manuel Pellegrini will have noticed.

Toure has faced these questions before. He faced them last season and answered them metaphorically and literally.

'I hear what people say and I prove them wrong,' he said at a press conference earlier this year.

As he gets older and the City squad grows ever deeper, however, Toure will perhaps come under greater scrutiny.

Pellegrini bought another central midfielder – the Brazilian Fernando – in the summer and it is tempting to wonder if he would have played last night had injury not intervened.

There are always other roles for Toure, of course. He can be a devastating second striker, for example. Fernandinho certainly may not miss him in his current role.
