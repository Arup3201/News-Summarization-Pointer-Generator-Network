Gary Neville remembers an expression Cristiano Ronaldo used during his time at Manchester United.

‘Too much water kills the plant,’ remarked Ronaldo when Neville asked why he eased off in the final two sprints of an eight circuit session put on by United’s coaching staff. The player knew his body.

He had done the hard yards in 2006, returning from the World Cup in Germany ripped. The stories of Ronaldo in the gym performing thousands of sits ups or press ups a day, at United and with Real Madrid, are legendary.

Neville admits it opened his eyes to new methods, a different way of approaching fitness work after working his way through various academy teams at The Cliff.

‘I'd always been brought up to believe that every single minute of every day was a fight and that you had to battle continuously, even in training.

‘But though he (Ronaldo) would work hard, he would train with efficiency.’

England’s head coach Roy Hodgson is old school and he has admitted on a number of occasions that he has no interest in statistics.

This is a mistake, particularly when England bring in some of the leaders in their field to analyse the squad on international duty.

These days they are not just tracking positions on the pitch.

The sports scientists in the England set-up take saliva tests first thing in the morning from each player to check if they have slept properly. They know the results within minutes.

Stay up late into the night on the PlayStation or Xbox and the experts will know about it when they stick a nitric test strip into the mouth of each player when they meet for breakfast.

They test a player’s cortisol level, an indicator of stress, as part of the analysis. Burning the midnight oil, being stressed or anxious about a situation, activates the cortisol hormone.

On the field, heart rate monitors on each player during every training session are downloaded at the end of training and will tell England’s management team if anyone is being overloaded.

That is the modern way, but by far the most important person to listen to is the player himself. Raheem Sterling knows his body better than anyone.

By flagging up his personal thoughts on the day of England’s final training session before they travelled up to Estonia, it seems Sterling probably talked himself out of the team.

It was a little naive, particularly when stories abound about the sacrifices players made in the past to pursue a career in the game.

For example, in the early days of Carlton Cole’s career at Chelsea, when no-one recognised him (or certainly wouldn’t dream of ratting on him), he would turn out for his uncle’s Sunday side in Hounslow, west London, the day after a reserve game.

When Cristiano Ronaldo was the same age Raheem Sterling is now, he had played eight more matches. The Liverpool man would do well to follow the Portuguese's example  

Ronaldo: Sporting (25), Portugal U15, U17, U20, U21 & U23 (34), Portugal full national team (18), Manchester Utd (60)

137 matches 

Sterling: Liverpool (87), England U16, U17, U19, U21 (31), England full national team (11).

129 matches 

There are numerous examples from bygone eras of players representing school sides on Saturday morning before turning out for a men’s team in the afternoon.

There will be sportsmen in other disciplines who will be surprised that a 19-year-old footballer is prepared to approach his manager and admit to being fatigued.

Take Rafa Nadal, for example, a tennis player who, like the majority of players working at the elite level, relies on explosive power in short bursts to cover his working area.

Listen to him talk about his sessions with physical trainer Joan Forcades and perhaps football has some lessons to learn from athletes who are the top of their game in other sports.

Writing in his book RAFA, he talks about his training regime one or two days before match.

‘There was another thing Forcades was emphatic about: that we should stick to the training regime even when I least felt like it, when I was tired or in a bad mood or, for whatever reason, just not feeling up to it.

Rafa Nadal, pictured in the Italian Open earlier this year, practises for between four and six hours a day

‘There were days during a tournament when I would not be feeling at my best either and by training in such circumstances I’d be better prepared to compete when I was below par.’

Nadal practises, including gym and court work, for anywhere between four and six hours a day, depending on his schedule.

If you apply Nadal’s training principles to the England team then Sterling had very little to complain about when he spoke with Hodgson on Saturday morning.

Perhaps Sterling is unaware of the sacrifices sportsmen make in other fields, but he paid the price for his honesty.

Hodgson himself is an inflexible type and he will be very much of the mind that every England cap has to be earned by the players in his squad.

After this, it is down to Neville to turn mediator.
