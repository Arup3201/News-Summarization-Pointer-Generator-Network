Three of America's biggest sports stars - Peyton Manning, LeBron James and Serena Williams - have been named and shamed as the worst at marketing unhealthy food to kids.

Researchers at Yale University found pro athletes promoted 44 different food or beverage brands during 2010, with 79 percent of those food products being 'energy-dense and nutrient-poor.'

In the drinks market, 93 per cent of the drinks the mega stars put their names to - including sports drinks - received all of their calories from added sugar, authors found.

But the worst culprits were the most famous athletes, a fact that saddened health experts.

Denver Broncos signal caller, Peyton Manning, has endorsement deals with Papa John's pizza and Oreo cookies, adding to the $12 million he makes annually from lending his face, voice and persuasive powers brands.

According to Forbes, he even owns 21 Papa John's stores in the Denver area.

Meanwhile, Miami Heat champion LeBron James earns $42 million per year by endorsing McDonald's, Coca-Cola and other products and number 3 on the researchers' list of stars who plug unhealthy products is tennis powerhouse Serena Williams, who in the past has done ads for McDonald's and Oreo cookies.

Many of those food-and-beverage sales campaigns are aimed at young consumers, the study, which was published Monday in the journal Pediatrics, found.

'When taking into account the nutrient quality of the products endorsed and the amount of advertising for each product, Peyton Manning, LeBron James, and Serena Williams are the highest contributors to the marketing of unhealthy foods,' the paper concluded.

The authors said it 'ironic' that 'some of the world's most physically fit and well-known athletes' were promoting the unhealthy food and drinks and said it sends 'mixed messages about diet and health.'

The study compared the modern day junk food flogging to the cigarette ads of sports stars like Babe Ruth and Ted Williams appeared in.

The authors are urging the mega stars to re-think their decisions to push sugar-rich drinks or high-calorie foods.

'Our ultimate hope would be that athletes reject the unhealthy endorsements or, at the very least, promote healthy foods,' Yale University clinical psychology doctoral student and lead author in the study Marie Bragg told NBC News.

'These athletes have an opportunity to work with parents. Instead, they're promoting really unhealthy foods.'Â
