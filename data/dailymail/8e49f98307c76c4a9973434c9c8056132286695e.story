A mother who was told she could not breastfeed her newborn in a hospital waiting room yesterday condemned the ‘disgusting’ way the NHS had treated her.

Gemma Murphy was reduced to tears after nurses put her in a private room so she could feed six-week-old Niamh without offending other patients.

She was asked to move even though none of the other six women in the waiting room at the time had complained.

Not allowed: Gemma Murphy was left in tears after being barred from feeding six-week-old Niamh while she waited for a blood test with her husband at the Hospital of St Cross  in Rugby, Warwickshire

Mrs
 Murphy, 37, had gone to the Hospital of St Cross in  Rugby, 
Warwickshire, for tests to see whether she still had the gestational 
diabetes she developed in pregnancy.

She
 was particularly shocked because she had gone to the trouble of calling
 the hospital before her appointment to make sure she would be able to 
breastfeed her daughter after it wrote to say it offered no childcare 
facilities and that the procedure would require two blood tests with a 
two-hour wait in between.

Mrs
 Murphy, head of marketing and development at children’s charity The 
Smallpiece Trust, said: ‘Breastfeeding can be difficult enough already. 
You need all the support you can get.

‘The
 NHS encourages breastfeeding, particularly in a baby’s early weeks. I 
certainly didn’t expect to be told in a hospital that I couldn’t 
breastfeed.’

Last straw: Mrs Murphy said she was left tearful by the hospital's attitude, on what was six-week-old baby Niamh's first major outing

Investigation: A spokesman for University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire Trust said it was aware of Mrs Murphy's complaint

The row comes 
after 1,000 women staged a series of nationwide protests on Saturday in 
support of Emily Slough, 27, from Rugeley, Staffordshire, who was 
branded a ‘tramp’ on Facebook alongside a picture of her breastfeeding 
in public.

Mrs Murphy, from 
Rugby, said she was confronted by a nurse who spotted Niamh in her pram 
moments after arriving at the hospital with husband Paul, 43.

She added: ‘The nurse said I shouldn’t have brought Niamh and that I might offend other patients by breastfeeding.

‘She
 suggested I should have considered expressing milk into a bottle for 
Paul to feed her. But if you introduce a bottle too soon the baby can 
get used to it and stop feeding from the breast. It was only thanks to 
another nurse overhearing the conversation that I was offered a private 
room to breastfeed in. Otherwise I would have been turned away.’

Other case: Emily Slough, mother of eight-month-old daughter Matilda, was labelled a 'tramp' for breastfeeding in public, before hitting back by organising a mass breastfeeding protest

Backing: More than 1,000 mothers took to the streets in towns and cities around Britain at the weekend and breastfed in public to show their support for the young mother

Mrs Murphy said she quickly fed Niamh before her husband stepped in to look after their daughter while she was tested.

Yesterday
 the hospital claimed there was a health and safety risk to mothers at 
the appointments. It said patients attending the tests were at risk of 
fainting, so they should not bring babies with them. It added that the 
procedure also required the women to sit still between the tests.

However,
 Mr Murphy, a director of an environmental consultancy, said: ‘We 
understand how this could be an issue if a mother attended on her own 
with the child, as there would be nobody to look after the baby if she 
fainted.

‘But I was with Gemma and Niamh on this occasion and was able to step in.’

Campaigners criticised the hospital yesterday.

Breastfeeding
 counsellor Emma Pickett, of the Association of Breastfeeding Mothers, 
said: ‘It’s against civil law for a business or organisation to ask a 
breastfeeding mother to move from a particular space. The only time such
 a stance could be justified is if the baby’s life could be put in 
danger, such as if the mother needed to have an X-ray and wanted to take
 her baby in.’

Janet Fyle, 
professional policy adviser at the Royal College of Midwives, branded 
the hospital’s actions ‘disgraceful’, adding: ‘Women should be able to 
breastfeed anywhere they choose.’

National Childbirth Trust policy adviser Rosemary Dodds said it was ‘inexcusable that the NHS has mistreated this woman’.

Mrs
 Murphy has complained to University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire
 NHS, and is due to meet David Eltringham, its chief operating officer.

Yesterday he said the trust supported breastfeeding and was investigating her claims.

Gestational
 diabetes affects women during pregnancy, when there are high levels of 
glucose in the blood. Women over 35 are thought to carry a higher risk 
of developing it. The condition usually clears up after birth.
