Andy Murray had a new look and there were a few early signs of a new game style as he kicked off his season with a surprisingly hard-fought exhibition victory over Spain’s Feliciano Lopez.

With the all black kit of his suppliers Under Armour making its debut, Murray took two and a half hours to defeat the world No 14 7-6, 5-7, 6-4 at the Mubadala World Tennis Tournament in Abu Dhabi.

Despite the length of the match, there was more intent from the ex-Wimbledon champion to shorten the points by being prepared to attack the net, something he is sure to have worked on over the past month with coach Amelie Mauresmo.

It may be an unofficial event with no ranking points at stake but there was precious little hit ‘n giggle about an intense contest, with both players clearly keen to get a proper game in with so little time ahead of this month’s Australian Open.

‘It was a tough match and the last few games were very hard,’ said Murray, who is training hard alongside competing this week. ‘It was a hard way to start the new year and I hope the matches get a bit easier from now on!’

Murray takes on Rafael Nadal in the tournament semi-final on Friday, with the French Open champion very much in need of match tightness with Melbourne already looming.

Murray was more aggressive than usual, but the new approach was not always as successful as hoped

Murray looks to be trying to develop his net game and overall tried to be more aggressive than we are accustomed to seeing. The intention was commendable although the results were mixed against the veteran lefthander.

He was by far the better player in the tiebreak which he won 7-1, before letting the second set slip late on. He broke serve three times in the decider but struggled to consolidate his lead and close it out, needing five match points in the final game.

In the second match, Stan Wawrinka saw off another Spaniard in Nicolas Almagro with a straight-sets victory in just over an hour.

Wawrinka put on a dominant display to clinch the first set 6-3 before Almagro, who replaced Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the tournament as the Frenchman nurses an arm injury, came out of the blocks flying - winning the first game of the second without dropping a point.

But his Swiss opponent got the better of him and turned the set around as he raced to a 6-2 victory to set up a last-four clash with world No 1 and defending champion Novak Djokovic.
