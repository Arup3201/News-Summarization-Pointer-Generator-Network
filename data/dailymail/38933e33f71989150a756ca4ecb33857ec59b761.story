A photograph or postcard are popular souvenirs to take with us after visiting a foreign country.

But one Singaporean woman has designed a novel way to remember places she has visited throughout the world - by creating stunning canvases using a needle and thread.

Teresa Lim stiches beautiful patterns of landscapes she encounters on her travels, giving her as much time as possible to savour the differing landscapes she views.

Teresa's favourite colour is green, so this would have provided her a perfect landscape in Tokyo

On a visit to London, the 24-year-old textile designer captured Big Ben perfectly, as well as the Coca Cola London Eye in the background

The serenity of Charles Bridge in Prague allowed Teresa Lim the chance to spend some quality time in the capital

The 24-year-old has a series of embroidery reflecting landmarks around the globe including Charles Bridge in Prague, Big Ben in London and the Serpentine Falls in Perth.

Her work has been showcased in fashion shows in Singapore, Bangkok, Hong Kong and Tokyo, with the Teresa keen to blur the lines between being an illustrator and textile designer.

The talented Lim has labelled her unique work Sew Wanderlust, as she introduces a different approach to digital photo albums and photobooks.

As her favourite colour is green, she takes advantage of seeing this on her travels, to construct the wonderful memories to treasure forever. 

Serpentine Falls in Perth, Australia, offered more of a challenge to Teresa as she had to capture movement of a rushing waterfall 

The Holocaust Memorial in Berlin, Germany, offered Teresa an emotional reminder of her visit to the scene of such turmoil

This picturesque location of Laufersweiler in Germany offered Teresa the chance to stitch animals enjoying their landscape

Teresa graduated from Lasalle College of the Arts in Singapore with a First Class (BA Hons) in Fashion Design and Textiles.

The college has a partnership with Goldsmiths, University of London.

Teresa is currently working on another project called the 'Sad Girls Club' which depict upset and crying girls as stitchings, although it is unknown whether these are taken from everyday scenes.

The clash in colours is demonstrated nicely in the Singaporean's textile design here of Hanoi, the capital of Vietnam

There's plenty of green for Teresa to enjoy here as she captures the darkness falling in Amsterdam in The Netherlands

Prague Old Town, the scene of tourist activity enjoying the spectacular architecture that Teresa captures beautifully

Ha Long Bay is a UNESCO World Heritage sight in Vietnam, so this was an obvious choice for Teresa to replicate
