The mother who led New Mexico police on a dramatic chase that culminated in their shooting at the minivan she was driving with her children inside has spoken out about the incident.

Calling one of police officers a 'terrifying individual,' Oriana Ferrell, 39, wrote in a letter penned from her prison cell last month and published in the Taos News yesterday that she drove away from police repeatedly to protect her children.

'A uniformed officer can shoot three bullets at my van and be considered to be “doing his job”, but my doing what I can to get my own children away from such a terrifying individual has been termed “child abuse” and “endangerment,” according to New Mexico law,' she wrote.

New Mexico State Police have opened an investigation into the conduct of the troopers - and driver Oriana Ferrell and her 14-year-old son are facing charges.

Calling herself a 'peace officer,' Ferrell writes: 'As a single, African-American mother of five in this country, things are tough enough I should not have to endure harassment at the hands of someone who has been hired to protect the citizens of this land over an alleged “speeding offense.” No one should.'

The
traffic stop took place south of Taos, New Mexico, on October 28 - but 
it sparked local outrage after the video from a state police dashboard camera
went public.

Footage shows the officer casually walk up to the vehicle and begin speaking with the driver.

When the officer walks away, presumably to run the license and registration and decide whether to write a ticket, the van takes off.

Enough is enough: The driver's teen son then gets out to defend her

A short chase ensues before the driver again relents and the van makes its way to the side of the road.

The
officer at this point has had enough. He storms up to and opens the 
driver’s side door while ordering the driver out of the vehicle.

She refuses and a struggle ensues as children inside the Ford can be heard screaming.

The driver’s son, 14, according to ABC News, gets out of the van but thinks better of the idea as the cop pulls a Taser on him.

Ms Ferrell does eventually exit the vehicle and gets into a physical confrontation with the officer while he tries to arrest her.

That's it: Having seen enough, the teen jumps out of the car to confront the officer

At this point, the teen appears to 
attack the cop as Ms Ferrell is at once being pulled back into the van 
by a screaming younger girl and being pulled into the middle of the road
by the cop.

The teen and the officer tussle before he runs back into the van as more police arrives to assist the over-matched officer.

The primary officer is then shown 
smashing the right rear passenger window with his baton as petrified 
children trapped inside the van scream for help.

Ms Ferrell has had enough, she slams on the gas and drives away as a second officer opens fire on the back of her van – emptying multiple rounds in the direction of young children.

A frantic chase through wrong-way traffic and a small town ensues before Ms Ferrell finally gives herself up in front of a hotel.

Both she and her son are seen being led away in handcuffs.

Since she penned the letter, Ferrell has been released on bail.

The Taos News' editor said the paper does not usually publish op-ed pieces pertaining to ongoing legal cases, but made an exception in this case because of the huge public interest in the case.

According to ABC News, she was charged with five counts of abuse of a child, aggravated fleeing an officer, resisting an officer, reckless driving and possession of drug paraphernalia. Her 14-year-old son was charged with battery of an officer.

Ferrell, who refers to herself as a 'model parent,' will appear in court in April.
