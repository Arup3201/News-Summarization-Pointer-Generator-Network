Those Manchester United fans who have chanted 'four-four-two' at Louis van Gaal during some laboured performances this season should readjust their red-tinted spectacles.

Sir Alex Ferguson might have been the greatest manager of the Barclays Premier League era but the notion he sent out every United team to win 7-6 in an orgy of reckless abandon is nonsense.

In 2008/09, Ferguson's United drew 0-0 on nine occasions when they had a forward line of Cristiano Ronaldo, Wayne Rooney, Carlos Tevez and Dimitar Berbatov. There weren't many complaints when they won the Premier League and reached the Champions League final.

Van Gaal has been given little credit for steadying the United ship after they failed to qualify for Europe last season. They travel to West Ham today well set to finish in the top four having conceded one goal in their last six games and nine in their last 18.

However, their last two away games, a 2-0 win at QPR and goalless FA Cup draw with Cambridge United, have been met with disgruntlement from supporters who somehow feel the team should never look laboured in any circumstances.

Van Gaal doesn't play with two out-and-out wingers like Sir Matt Busby and Ferguson, in his earlier years, did. But very few do anymore in the Premier League. The Dutchman tries to be adventurous in a different way, getting his defenders to push up with the ball so that the team have controlled possession nearer the opposition goal.

'Yes, he wants the responsibility to be on the centre-backs, he doesn't want us to play the easy option,' says defender Chris Smalling.

'It gives us more responsibility to really drive out and find those passes as a lot of teams drop off, and if we can get the ball to the midfielders when they are higher up, rather than dropping in, we are more of a threat.'

United are hardly playing an ultra-defensive, Catenaccio style. Their Premier League goal tally of 39 in 23 games is higher than at this stage last season and fourth-best in the division going into today's fixtures.

Pivotal to Van Gaal's philosophy of wearing teams down rather than instantly going for the throat is the deployment of England centre-forward Wayne Rooney in midfield.

Rooney has bristled when he has played there under previous managers and while Van Gaal admits he needed to persuade his captain, he claims 29-year-old Rooney now enjoys it in the engine room.

As a striker, you are reliant on getting service from other players, in midfield you can control a game through your own efforts.

'It's about communication and me giving my arguments why he has to do that,' says Van Gaal. 'And, yes, sometimes convincing him he has to do something for the team. But I don't think he ever complains about where he has to play. And he is also liking to play in midfield because he is more on the ball.'

Louis van Gaal was convinced from the day he took over at Old Trafford that Wayne Rooney could star as a midfielder for Manchester United - and how right he was. 

 Rooney began the season leading the line as United struggled but, as the statistics show, he has been far more influential since dropping into midfield. Rooney averages 31 touches and 24 successful passes more as a midfielder and has also created more chances.  

Rooney's versatility has been an occasional curse during his career and Van Gaal admits he has to tread sensitively.

But he loves the fact his captain can play well anywhere; central midfield, No 10, inside-left, striker or even wide-right, as he appeared on Tuesday night in a 3-0 FA Cup win against Cambridge. 'Not many players can play in as many positions as Rooney because he is multi-functional. But that is also not always a benefit for him. A player normally doesn't like that so I have to take care of that,' admits Van Gaal.

'I like multi-functional players because you can be more varied and more unpredictable for opponents when you change positions.

'When I had that team at Ajax [1995 Champions League winners], I changed Edgar Davids from a winger to midfield, Michael Reiziger was a No 10 and I made him a right-back. Frank Rijkaard came as a No 6 right midfielder and I made him a centre-half. With Rooney that is possible.'

Rooney has scored eight goals and has five assists this season. But as he closes in on Sir Bobby Charlton's Manchester United goalscoring record, his manager can't make any promises about how often he will play up front in the future.

It was noticeable against Cambridge that Marouane Fellaini was pushed forward while Rooney's role seemed to be delivering crosses. Van Gaal also has Robin van Persie, Falcao and James Wilson to choose from up front. The United manager says: 'Rooney's position depends on the shape of the team and the form of the strikers.

Considering Robin van Persie, Radamel Falcao and James Wilson, playing Rooney up front is not a given 

'I know I can always use him but I also know I cannot change him so easily from midfielder to striker during a game because I did it once and he was not so good. He can be better moving from striker to midfielder, rather than the other way around. When we play with three defenders and four midfield players, maybe inside-left is better for him. But when we have a different system and need someone right-footed on the wing, he is on the right.

'That is what I am saying to Wayne — your contribution for the team is bigger when you play at right-half. Why? You can cross and can pass better as you are on the right side. Then you can prepare overlaps of Antonio Valencia.'

And, of course, while Michael Carrick is injured, Rooney can dictate play from a central area. Whatever the system, Van Gaal is aware the responsibility of being United manager is to entertain, and win.

He spoke about the 'United Way' on Friday as the club marked the 57th anniversary of the Munich air crash and said afterwards: 'It doesn't matter, wingers or not wingers, three or four at the back, it is about being effective.'

United fans put a curse on the previous manager whenever they sang: 'Come on David Moyes, play like Fergie's boys.'

As Van Gaal prepares for a difficult afternoon in the trenches at Upton Park, a little understanding from his own following wouldn't go amiss.

Rooney's versatility will be used by van Gaal and the United captain will play where they 'need him most'
