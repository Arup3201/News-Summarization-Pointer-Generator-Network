Connie the condom dress was made by Illawarra youngsters

It looks like something Lady Gaga might wear. 

The neon coloured crazy latex creation made from 300 condoms was created 6 months ago and is now touring the shores of NSW.

It was originally created by Brazillian artist Adriana Bertini who creates dresses from expired or defective condoms to promote safe sex amongst youngsters. 

Now the blueprint is being used in NSW and neighbourhood groups are making their very own Connie the condom dresses. 

This is the fifth time a Connie frock has been created by a group of youngsters. 

Not everyone is in favour of the dress with Shoalhaven City Councillor Andrew Guile and mayor Joanna Gash clashing over the issue. 

Mr Guile told Daily Mail Australia he did not like Connie being displayed at 'family friendly venues'. 

'They (children) are already bombarded with sexualisation every day and it just creates confusion,' he said.

'There is also no evidence the dress raises sexual health awareness among young people.'

But Mayor Gash hit back at the negative comments telling Daily Mail Australia she was 'pleased that it is back' even though Connie 'does create differences of opinion'.

'We have high STI rates and anything we can do to draw attention to that is a good thing,' she said.

'I am well aware how difficult it is for adults to talk to kids about this and at least this is creating the conversation.' 

The latest Connie was made by 174 people, aged from just 11 to 24, at Thirroul Neighbourhood Centre on the NSW south coast between April and June this year.

The project took so long because the youngsters could not find a glue that would stick the condoms onto the mannequin.

Emily Messieh, youth and community services co-ordinator at the centre where the dress was made, said at first some of the youngsters called Connie 'gross' but the project 'started the conversation' about condoms and safe sex. 

Mrs Messieh, 25, told Daily Mail Australia her centre created their first Connie in 2011 but the new one was 'much better'.

She said: 'Last time we had quite a positive reaction when she toured in NSW. 

'We had a number of parents saying they wished their children had learnt about condoms when they were younger, as they had children very young or discovered they had an STI later in life.

The idea for the dresses came from Brazillian artist Adriana Bertini who runs the Condom Couture campaign

'We had one or two negative comments and complaints, but generally Connie was received very positively.

'I think we got chosen a second time because we did a good job.

'Statistics for young people with sexually transmitted diseases is high in Australia and something like this gives us the opportunity to we chat to young people and we can tell them happen if you don't have a condom.

'At first the kids were saying they were not interested and that's gross but that's where the questions start.

'Some will say why is it only the boy that has to use it and if a girl kisses her boyfriend is she going to get pregnant?

'Making Connie helps them show that we are open to questions and we have better conversations when they are being creative.

The aim of the dress is to start conversations in young people about sexually related diseases

Emily Messieh says Connie has generally received a positive response in NSW

'Some youngsters don't actually think STIs are problematic and can be really painful.

'They don't realise it can be so serious, but we show them appropriate pictures of things like genital warts to show them what can happen.'

Youth projects all over NSW can put together their own proposals to HIV/AIDS and Related Programs Unit (HARP) for funding to make their very own Connie.

The group used expired or defective condoms for the project

It took the youth project three months to create Connie 

Colette McGrath, HIV and Related Programs Manager for south eastern Sydney Local Health District, which rolls out the project, told Daily Mail Australia: 'There has been an increase in chlamydia in recent years and most of the increases have been with young people.

'Connie raises awareness in young people and something like chlamydia is easy to treat and people often do not know they have got it.'
