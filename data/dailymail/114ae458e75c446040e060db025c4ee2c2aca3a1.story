The UN's top court ruled today that Serbia and Croatia did not commit genocide against each other's people during the bloody 1990s wars sparked by the break-up of the former Yugoslavia. 

The International Court of Justice said Serb forces committed widespread crimes in Croatia early in the war, but they did not amount to genocide.

The 17-judge panel also ruled that a 1995 Croat offensive to win back territory from rebel Serbs also featured serious crimes, but did not reach the level of genocide.

Today's decision was not unexpected as the UN's Yugoslav war crimes tribunal, a separate court also based in The Hague, has never charged any Serbs or Croats with genocide in one another's territory.

ICJ chief judge Peter Tomka said both sides had committed crimes during the conflict, including forcible displacement, but that neither had proved genocide, which 'presupposes the intent to destroy a group, at least in part'.

But he added: 'The court encourages the parties to continue their co-operation with a view to offering appropriate reparation to the victims of such violations, thus consolidating peace and stability in the region.'

The case had been described by Serbian Foreign Minister Ivica Dacic as perhaps one of the 'most important events' determining his country's relations with Croatia.

Zagreb had dragged Belgrade before the ICJ in 1999 on genocide charges linked to the war in Croatia during the bloody break-up of the former Yugoslavia.

Serbia was accused of ethnic cleansing as a 'form of genocide' in the town of Vukovar and other areas, leading to large numbers of Croats being displaced, killed or tortured and their property destroyed.

About 20,000 people died in the conflict, one of several bloody wars that shook the Balkans in the 1990s.

Vukovar was captured after a three-month-long attack by the Yugoslav army (JNA) and Serb rebels.

After its fall, about 22,000 non-Serbs were expelled, and about 350 people from the Vukovar region are still reported missing.

Belgrade responded with a counter-suit in 2010, saying about 200,000 ethnic Serbs were forced to flee when Croatia launched a military operation to retake its territory in 1995.

Following Zagreb's counter-offensive, called Operation Storm, the proportion of ethnic Serbs in Croatia shrank from 12 percent to four per cent. 

Belgrade was outraged in 2012 when Operation Storm's Croatian military commander, Ante Gotovina (above), was acquitted on appeal before the Hague-based International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia

Belgrade was outraged in 2012 when Operation Storm's Croatian military commander, Ante Gotovina, was acquitted on appeal before the Hague-based International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).

'The irony is that Croatia... which with its forceful separatism, triggered an avalanche of the horrid civil war in the former Yugoslavia, is accusing someone else of genocide,' Serbia said in a statement as the case was being heard last year.   

The cases were part of the long legal fall-out from the break-up of Yugoslavia into seven states in wars that lasted eight years and left more than 130,000 dead in Europe's worst conflagration since World War Two. 

The U.N. tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which also sits in The Hague, has long since ruled that genocide was committed in Bosnia, where more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys were killed when the U.N. 'safe haven' of Srebrenica fell to Bosnian Serb forces in 1995.

In an earlier ruling from 2007 in a case brought by Bosnia, the ICJ found that Serbia was not responsible for genocide, but that it had breached the genocide convention by failing to prevent the massacre in Srebrenica.
