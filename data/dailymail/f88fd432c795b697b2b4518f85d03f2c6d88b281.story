Workers have just put the final beam on top of China's newest tallest building.

The staggering 2,073ft tall Shanghai Tower looms high above the forest of skyscrapers which makes up China's financial capital.

But the astonishing rate of growth means Shanghai Tower might only hold onto its crown for a short time as plans for a mega skyscraper are already advanced.

Journalists and photographers were invited to take in the stunning views from the top of the 125-storey building during a topping out ceremony today.

The event was held to make the completion of the core structure when the last beam was installed.

Shanghai Tower is located in the 
Lujiazui Finance and Trade Zone, an area of Shanghai that was farmland a
little over 20 years ago and has seen an explosion of construction of skyscrapers over the last decade.

The area is China's first super-tall 
district, as Shanghai Tower rises to complete a trio of towers including
the adjacent Jin Mao Tower and Shanghai World Financial Center.

Designer Art Gensler said: 'Shanghai Tower represents a new way of defining and creating cities.

'By incorporating best practices in 
sustainability and high-performance design, by weaving the building into
the urban fabric of Shanghai and drawing community life into the 
building, Shanghai Tower redefines the role of tall buildings in 
contemporary cities and raises the bar for the next generation of 
super-highrises.'

But a Chinese consortium has already expressed a desire to build the world's tallest tower - all 2,749ft of it.

If construction of the planned 
220-storey 'Sky City', in Changsa, the provicincial capital of Hunan, 
takes place, it would dwaft the current world's tallest building, the 
2,716ft tall Burj Khalifa in Dubai.

Broad Sustainable Building (BSB), a 
construction company based in Hunan, believers they can do the whole 
$628million construction in 90 days.

The project has been given the go-ahead in Changsa, but work has not yet begun.

Shanghai Tower will house Class-A office space, retail, a luxury hotel and cultural venues.

The uppermost floors will feature the
world's highest observation deck, while the tower's podium will offer a
high-end retail environment with a major event space. Below-grade 
facilities include retail, connections to the Shanghai Metro and three 
floors of parking.

'With the topping out of Shanghai 
Tower, the Lujiazui trio will serve as a stunning representation of our 
past, our present and China's boundless future,' said Jun Xia, Shanghai 
Tower design leader and Gensler principal.

'This tower takes inspiration from 
Shanghai's tradition of parks and neighborhoods, recasting that history 
in a high-density, urban form symbolizing the emergence of modern 
Shanghai and China.'

The project's developer is the 
Shanghai Tower Construction & Development Co., Ltd; Thornton 
Tomasetti is the structural engineer; Cosentini Associates are the 
mechanical, electrical and plumbing engineers; and the Architectural 
Design and Research Institute of Tongji University is the Local Design 
Institute. The development is slated for completion in 2014.

Shanghai Tower is organized as nine 
cylindrical buildings stacked one atop the other. The inner layer of the
double-skin fagade encloses the stacked buildings, while the exterior 
facade creates the building envelope, which rotates 120 degrees as it 
rises and gives Shanghai Tower its distinctive, curving appearance.

The spaces between the two fagade 
layers create nine atrium sky gardens. Much like plazas and civic 
squares in traditional cities, the public sky atria offer spaces within 
Shanghai Tower for interaction and community gathering space with 
restaurants, cafis, coffee shops and convenience stores, as well as lush
landscaping throughout.

With sky gardens lining its perimeter, Shanghai
Tower is literally enveloped in public spaces.

Shanghai Tower's interior and 
exterior skins are transparent, establishing a visual connection between
the tower's interiors and the urban fabric of Shanghai.

On the ground 
level, retail and event spaces, in tandem with abundant entrances on the
site and a subway station under the building, continue the physical and
visual connections between the tower and the city.

Shanghai Tower will have the world's 
fastest lifts, with the Mitsubishi-designed, double-height cabs whisking
building occupants and visitors skyward at 40 mph using innovative 
technologies designed specifically for the tower.

Sustainability is at the core of 
Shanghai Tower's design. The facade's taper, texture and asymmetry work 
in partnership to reduce wind loads on the building by 24 percent, 
offering a $58million savings in overall building materials.

The building's transparent inner and outer skins admit maximum natural daylight, thereby reducing the need for electric light.

The tower's outer skin also insulates the building, reducing energy use for heating and cooling. The tower's spiraling parapet collects rainwater, which is used for the tower's heating and air conditioning systems.

Wind turbines located directly beneath the parapet generate on-site power for the upper floors of the building, with a 2,130kW natural gas-fired cogeneration system on site providing electricity and heat energy to the lower floors. Fully one third of the site will be green space with landscaping that cools the site.

Overall, Shanghai Tower's sustainable strategies will reduce the building's carbon footprint by 34,000 metric tons per year; and the tower is targeting LEED Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council and the China Green Building Three Star rating.
