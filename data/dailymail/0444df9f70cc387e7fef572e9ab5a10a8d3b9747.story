The High Street decorations are up, the window displays are sparkling and festive Muzak is blaring out of almost every shop door.

With less than a month to go, this is the week when Christmas shopping begins in earnest for millions of bargain-hunting Britons.

And, this year, supermarket shelves seem to be overloaded with half-price Christmas offers like never before. Waitrose shoppers have been snapping up 50 per cent off Christmas biscuits all week.

You can pick up half-price coffee machines at Sainsbury’s, half-price Irish cream at Morrisons and half-price Cadbury’s Christmas Milk Tray at the Co-op. And at Tesco the aisles have been groaning under the weight of half-price Nivea, L’Oreal and Baylis & Harding toiletries gift sets.

Many Christmas products put on the shelves at the end of the summer have been reduced to half price this month - just in time for Christmas shoppers

At Asda, shoppers are bombarded with promotions for deals on Barbie dolls, Lego trucks and Peppa Pig play sets.

But while the deals look fantastic, shoppers looking for a recession-busting Christmas might want to pause before filling their trolleys.

For when it comes to surviving the festive season there are two golden rules: never drink on an empty stomach, and never shop on an empty head.

Half price doesn’t always mean half price. And when it comes to ripping us off at Christmas, no one does it quite like the supermarkets.

So what exactly does ‘half price’ really mean — and how can shoppers avoid the dodgy deals?

Bogus supermarket offers were supposed to have been outlawed last year when all but one of the major supermarkets signed up to new voluntary guidelines from the Office of Fair Trading (Asda said it simply wanted more time to consider the code).

The rules say prices must not be ‘artificially manipulated’ to make future discounts more attractive.

That means shops can’t inflate prices simply to slash them a few weeks later and claim the product is at half price.

Shops are not supposed to have goods on a sale price longer than they were at the full price.

And they are not supposed to set higher prices when goods are out of season — only to lower them in time for the expected seasonal rush.

While supermarkets insist they follow the rules, some appear to be sailing very close to the wind.

Christmas bargains: The Office of Fair Trading rules mean that supermarkets must not 'artificially manipulate' prices to make future discounts seem more appealing

It’s long been a source of bewilderment to shoppers why Christmas chocolates and toys start appearing in stores in September. But there’s a very good reason.

Extending the Christmas season back to the end of summer allows retailers to indulge in some crafty — but perfectly lawful — ‘discounting’ in November, when the festive shopping season really takes off.

Waitrose started to sell a Thorntons chocolate snowman on August 26, priced £8 for each 250g figure.

That’s an eye-watering price for chocolates and it’s a time of year when most parents are thinking about new school shoes, not stocking fillers.

But after two months, the price of the Snowman chocolates was halved to a more reasonable £4 on November  5 — and up went the ‘half-price’ labels promoting another apparently fabulous bargain.

And because Waitrose had them on sale at full price for so long — all the way through September and October — it is allowed to promote the chocolate figures as ‘half price’ all the way to Christmas Eve. Harrassed parents, looking for a quick stocking filler during the weekly shop, won’t have time to consider whether £4 is such a bargain. They’ll see the half-price label, grab it then head for the  frozen peas.

Waitrose did it with its Christmas chocolate biscuits, too. They went  on sale for £6 at the end of August before their price was dropped by half in November.

It could be argued that selling Christmas chocolate and biscuits in August at full price — only to slash them in November — is not in the spirit of the OFT rules. 

But the guidelines are vague about what counts as ‘in season’ and ‘out of season’. Supermarkets argue that the end of August is the start of the Christmas period in the shops and they are doing nothing dodgy.

It’s difficult to prove that 
supermarkets inflate prices out of season, before cutting them to boost 
sales in the run up to Christmas. And all, naturally, insist that their 
pricing is honest and transparent.

But one only needs to visit the wine and spirits section of the local supermarket to see the full extent of ‘yo-yoing’ Christmas price offers.

Six out of ten wine bottles sold in supermarkets are on special offer. It’s virtually impossible to visit a store without stumbling across a fantastic looking half-price deal. In Tesco this week it’s the turn of Australian Rawnsley Estate Cabernet Merlot — reduced from £10.99 to an impressive £5.49.

Wine lovers will tell you that, for £5.49, it’s a perfectly decent bottle of plonk for a Christmas party and reasonably good value. But is it really an  £11 bottle?

You don’t need to be a wine buff to know that £11 can get you a really good bottle — including some award-winning wines. Rawnsley Estate Cabernet Merlot is not one of them.

What it seems to be is a classic example of a ‘yo-yo’ price promotion.

According to the website Mysupermarket, Tesco had it on ‘half price’ through most of January and the first ten days of February.

It was back at half price for 11 days in March, for four weeks in April and May, and for another four weeks over the summer. It reappeared as a half-price bargain on November 13 ready for the start of the Christmas party season.

So far this year it’s been sold at half price for nearly four months out of 11. And while Tesco insists it is not in breach of any rules, it looks suspiciously like a product designed to spend two thirds of the year at an inflated price.

In reality, that’s not a bargain. It’s a marketing trick.

And other shops do the same. Earlier this month, the BBC’s Watchdog programme showed that most supermarkets use the same  yo-yo technique.

Sainsbury’s Piccini Chianti Riserva supposedly costs £11.99 at full price — and when it drops to £5.99, it’s promoted as a half-price bargain.

Watchdog found out that it spent 43 per cent of  the time as a  £5.99 wine.

And it’s not just wines that yo-yo in price. The Co-op is promoting  ‘half-price’ Cadbury’s Milk Tray for £3.99 this month.

Last month the same box cost £8. At the end of August and start of September it was back down to £4.

Tesco has been heavily promoting its half-price Christmas toiletries gift sets. They appeared in shops at the start of September as part of a three-for-two offer, went up to full price in October, and were at half price from the start of the month to the weekend just gone.

Technically, the store is following the OFT rules.

But effectively the gift sets have been on discount for more than half their time on supermarket shelves. So how can we shoppers avoid the half-price rip-off?

Shopping around certainly helps get a sense of when bargains are real and when they are inflated. And online databases such as Mysupermarket can help show the real prices over a year — not just the inflated prices before the discount.

All the supermarkets insist they are doing nothing wrong. A spokesman for the Co-op said its Christmas pudding was launched in August to allow people to ‘spread the cost of the festive season’ and went on promotion in October when demand rises  ‘as more people’s thoughts turn to Christmas’.

Waitrose said its promotions ‘will have been on full sale price in the same shop for the full period stated’. And it added that its price tickets were ‘very clear’. One thing is clear — supermarkets need to be more transparent, putting information on the shelves saying when and where goods were last at full price, and shoppers need to be more cynical about ‘half-price’ festive offers.

There’s one old adage that is never truer than at Christmas. When something seems too good to be true, it usually is.
