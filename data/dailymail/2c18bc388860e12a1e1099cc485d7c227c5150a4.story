Estranged real-estate heir Robert Durst was arrested in New Orleans after new evidence emerged about his alleged murder of a friend who may have known about the suspicious disappearance of his wife.

He was taken into custody at 4.30pm Saturday night at the JW Marriot on a probable cause warrant for the 2000 Beverly Hills murder of his friend Susan Berman, FBI Los Angeles spokesman Laura Eimiller told Daily Mail Online.

Durst has long been suspected of killing Ms Berman, and the arrest follows new evidence seen in the HBO documentary miniseries The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst, which examines the case. 

His estranged younger brother Douglas, who heads his family's multi-billion dollar real estate company, said that his family was 'relieved and also grateful to everyone who assisted in the arrest of Robert Durst.'

His estranged younger brother Douglas, who heads his family's multi-billion dollar real estate company, said that his family was 'relieved and also grateful to everyone who assisted in the arrest of Robert Durst.'

'We hope he will finally be held accountable for all he has done,' he said.  

Ms Emiller said that Mr Durst was arrested after discussions between the FBI and LAPD planning his apprehension had been going on for the last couple of days.

'As a result of investigative leads and additional evidence that has come to light in the past year, investigators have identified Robert Durst as the person responsible for Ms. Berman's death,' The Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement. 

The millionaire had been living at the hotel and was recognized by agents in the lobby during his arrest on Saturday.

Durst's lawyer Chip Lewis said that his client would not fight extradition to California. 

'He's maintained his innocence for years,' Mr Lewis said. 'Nothing has changed.' 

'It's all about Hollywood now,' he said, adding that the arrest was probably orchestrated by the entertainment industry. 

The HBO show has stirred up interested in the case again after uncovering new information about Ms Berman's death.

The woman's stepson Sareb Kaufman gave filmmakers a letter from Durst to his stepmother a year before she died from a gunshot wound to the back of the head.

It has similar handwriting  as one sent to police alerting them of her murder right before Christmas.

It also featured the same spelling mistake, writing Beverly Hills as 'Beverley Hills'. 

Authorities in Los Angeles, who have long thought Durst sent the murder letter, have reopened the investigation into Ms Berman's murder after receiving Kaufman's message.

The killing took place right before she was scheduled to be questioned about the 1982 disappearance of Durst's first wife Kathleen McCormack in New York. 

Mr Lewis said he had 'no doubt we will present a most compelling defense' in the case against his client. 

He said new evidence touted by HBO producers was something he had already been acquainted with.

Berman, whose father was a mafia boss, was seen as acting as Durst's unofficial spokesman after his wife's disappearance, in which the heir was suspected by many of foul play.

Some have also thought that Ms Berman helped Durst bury Ms McCormack in New Jersey, Rolling Stone reported.

Durst admitted to forcing his wife to have an abortion in 1976 and physically abusing her during their troubled marriage

Durst was not picked to manage the empire his father created, and instead control of the business was given to his younger brother Douglas

Last month Durst, who has spoken openly to the HBO series, said that he was 'complicit in Kathie's not being here' but had nothing to do with her disappearance.

He also admitted to forcing her to have an abortion in 1976 and having a physical altercation with her the night she disappeared.

Durst has admitted killing another man less than a year after the death of Ms Berman. 

The millionaire was tried for the grisly 2001 murder of his neighbor Morris Black in Texas.

He was found not guilty in 2003 after claiming the killing was in self-defense, but he admitted to dismembering the body, putting it in bags and dumping it in Galveston Bay.

Durst had moved to Texas and was pretending to be a mute woman named Dorothy Ciner at the time of the killing. 

The suspected early 2000s murders followed Durst's estrangement from his family, which are heirs to the real estate fortune amassed by his father New York developer Seymour Durst.

Robert did not take up tee reigns of his father's empire, which were instead given to his younger brother Douglas following Seymour's death in 1995.

The estranged Durst later regained $65 million in a court settlement with his family.

Beyond the HBO documentary, his life is the inspiration for the movie All Good Things, which was also directed by The Jinx's filmmaker Andrew Jarecki.

The director he was intrigued after 'seeing someone who is born to such privilege and years later is living in a $300-a-month rooming house in Galveston, Texas, disguised as a mute woman'.

His bizarre cases have captivated audiences with Durst's eccentricities, which have included dressing up in fake mustaches while a fugitive.

He was rearrested for the Black trial after he shaved all the hair and eyebrows, skipped town on $300,000 bail and was arrested in Pennsylvania for trying to steal a chicken sandwich despite the fact that he was carrying thousands of dollars.

He served about three years in prison for his bail offense.

He was fined $500 last year after peeing on a candy rack at a Houston CVS pharmacy in July, according to KHOU.

Durst has remarried to Debrah Lee Charatan, who is seen on the HBO show, on December 11, 2000, shortly before Ms Berman died.

He divorced Ms McCormack in 1990, angering her family by not reaching out to them. She was declared legally dead in 2001.

His net worth was estimated to be just under $100million earlier this year, according to The Squander. 

Forbes estimates that the Durst family has $4.4billion. 

The JW Marriott in New Orleans would not comment on the arrest.
