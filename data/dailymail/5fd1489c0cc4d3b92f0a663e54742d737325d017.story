Probe: Rebekah Brooks is likely to be interviewed as a witness amid claims she was passed details of the original News of the World phone hacking inquiry

Scotland Yard tipped off Rebekah Brooks as early as 2006 about the full extent of phone-hacking at the News of the World, the Leveson inquiry has heard.

Police told Mrs Brooks, then editor of The Sun, they were confident that private detective Glenn Mulcaire and the Sunday newspaper’s royal editor Clive Goodman were ‘bang to rights’.

Detectives had established that Mulcaire – working solely for the News of the World – had hacked more than 100 victims’ phones and had been paid more than £1million by News International.

The revelations were contained in an internal News of the World email read out at the Leveson inquiry yesterday.

The revelation came hot on the heels of News 
International's launch of the Sun on Sunday, to replace the NotW 
which was shut down amid a public outcry.

The damning email undermines News International’s claims – which they were still clinging to until 2010 – that phone-hacking was not a widespread problem at the paper but the work of Mulcaire and Goodman alone.

It also exposed the cosy relationship between the Metropolitan Police and Rupert Murdoch’s News International group.

The email, headed ‘strictly private and confidential’, was sent on September 15, 2006, by Tom Crone, the NoW’s legal manger, to the paper’s then editor Andy Coulson.

This was after Mulcaire and Goodman had been arrested, but before their conviction.

Mr Crone wrote: ‘Here is what Rebekah told me about info relayed to her by the cops.‘They suggested that they were not widening the case to include other NoW people, but would do so if they got direct evidence, say NoW journos directly accessing the voicemails (this is what did for Clive).’

The email also noted: ‘The only payment records they found were from News International, ie the NoW retainer and other invoices, they said that over the period they looked at (going way back) there seemed to be over £1million of payments.’

Mr Crone’s message concluded: ‘They’re going to contact RW (Rebekah Wade, Mrs Brooks’s maiden name) today to see if she wishes to take it further.’

Goodman and Mulcaire were arrested on August 8, 2006. On November 29 that year they pleaded guilty to intercepting voicemail messages left on royal aides’ phones and were jailed on January 26, 2007.

The Independent Police Complaints Commission said last week it is investigating a senior Yard officer for allegedly inappropriately passing information about the 2006 phone-hacking inquiry to a News International executive.

The unnamed officer, who was involved in the first 2006 phone-hacking probe, has not been suspended while the allegations are investigated.

Scotland Yard have been criticised for failing to discover evidence that hacking went beyond a single rogue reporter in the original investigation led by Andy Hayman.

Yesterday it was revealed for the first time that the NotW's publisher has admitted four journalists on the paper personally hacked phones - and that the practice was still going on as recently as 2009.

The reporters, who have not been named, were apparently shown how to intercept voicemails by private detective Glenn Mulcaire, the Daily Telegraph reported.

Clive Goodman, the former royal reporter, is the only NotW staff member to have admitted hacking so far.

James Murdoch, the News International executive chairman, has repeatedly denied having any knowledge that phone hacking went beyond the single journalist.

According to court papers, one journalist - known only as E - illegally accessed Kelly Hoppen's voicemail in June 2009.

The revelations are contained in admissions made by publishers News Group Newspapers in court papers prepared for a High Court phone hacking trial. The case will not go ahead as all the people claiming damages have reached out of court settlements.

As the hacking scandal engulfed the NotW last year, Rebekah Brooks was forced to quit her post as News International chief-executive.

Launch: Rupert Murdoch is in London to oversee the first edition of the Sun on Sunday

Ms Brooks was editor of the NotW 
between 2000 and 2003 - and editor of The Sun in 2006 when the original 
phone-hacking inquiry was carried out.

It was then that the police officer allegedly provided her with details of the investigation.

The
officer works in the Metropolitan Police's specialist operations 
division which handles protection for the most senior public figures and
deals with counter-terrorism operations.

There is no suggestion they were paid for providing details of the investigation.

Although the News International 
executive who was passed details of the original investigation has not 
been named, the Independent reported that it is understood to be Ms 
Brooks.

A spokesman for Rebekah Brooks yesterday refused to comment.

A spokesman for the Independent Police Complaints Commission confirmed that they were probing the claims.

'The IPCC is 
independently investigating an allegation of inappropriate disclosure of
information by a serving Metropolitan Police officer during the original phone hacking 
investigation in 2006,' he said.

'However, as the IPCC has 
made clear, there is no evidence to suggest that any inappropriate 
payment of any sort was made to this officer.

'After careful consideration of the circumstances in this case 
it has been decided that suspending this officer, who is based within 
Specialist Operations, or restricting his duties would not be 
appropriate. This will obviously be kept under review.'

New paper: The Sun on Sunday was launched on Sunday as successor to the News of the World which was shut down last July at the height of the phone-hacking scandal

The IPCC launched their probe after 
being called in by detectives working on Operation Elveden which is 
investigating allegations of inappropriate payments to serving police 
officers.

The Leveson 
Inquiry is hearing details of the complex relationship between 
News International and the Metropolitan Police.

Yesterday
it was revealed that News of the World bosses ordered emails that could
be used against them in court to be deleted in a bid to cover up the 
phone hacking scandal.

Hundreds
of thousands of emails were deleted on 'nine separate occasions' while 
computers were destroyed and a senior executive ordered a staff member 
to remove all paper records connected to them, it was alleged.

The
fresh revelations came as News International launched the 
first edition of the Sun on Sunday as a successor to the 
defunct News of the World.

Bosses have recruited celebrity columnists including Katie Price and Nancy Dell'Olio for its latest title, while the Archbishop of York and chef Heston Blumenthal will also have weekly slots.

Rupert Murdoch, who flew into the UK to oversee the launch, had declared he would be 'very happy' if sales of his new paper exceed two million copies and enjoyed similar success to the NotW.

The penultimate issue of the title, which ceased publication at the height of the phone hacking scandal in July last year, sold around 2.7 million copies.

In a tweet yesterday, he revealed that the first Sunday edition of The Sun sold 3.26million copies.

News International announced the birth of a Sunday edition of the biggest selling UK daily newspaper on Monday last week and Mr Murdoch has since said it sold out of advertising space.

Bob Satchwell, executive director of the Society of Editors, said a new Sunday title would be welcomed by both journalists and the public alike.
