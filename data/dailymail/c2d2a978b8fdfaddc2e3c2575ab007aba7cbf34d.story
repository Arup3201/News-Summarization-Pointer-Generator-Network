Mourning family and friends have taken to social media to pay tribute to a teenage boy who was killed whilst performing a stunt.

It is believed Jack Irving was being filmed by his brother and a friend when he leaned out a moving train and slammed his head into a signal pole at 9.20pm on Friday. The 17-year-old was struck by the pole about 200 metres from Malvern station, south-east of Melbourne.

Jack, from Beaumaris, who was travelling with his brother and a female friend, had managed to get inside the driver's cabin at the rear of the train and was leaning outside the door when the tragedy unfolded.

The boy's brother and friend were interviewed by police and it is believed the trio were trying to film the stunt, Nine News reports.

'It appears that he may have been hanging on the side of the train or hanging from the train when his head has hit the signage or pole on the side of the track,' Acting Sergeant Andrew Kiss said.

Jack suffered multiple injuries on impact. Emergency crews treated him at the scene but he died shortly before 11pm in hospital.

Jack's father, Tim Irving, paid tribute to his son on social media, writing: 'Our beautiful boy and big brother. In Gods presence now and made this world that bit better for 17 years. Thank you for being you Jack. Eternal love, Dad xxxxxxxx'

Jack was dating Elyse Waterman, and friends took to social media to express their support for Ms Waterman, calling the pair the 'most beautiful' and 'Strongest and happiest couple I know'.

On Saturday Ms Waterman shared a photograph of the pair with a message to Jack: 'Blessed to have met you... miss you already.'

Friends and family have paid tribute to the 17-year-old Beaumaris student, describing him as an 'angel'

Police are currently reviewing CCTV footage to work out how the group gained access to the driver's rear cabin.

'It is a tragic accident. It's going to impact severely on all family and friends,' Sgt Kiss said.

Safety procedures on trains will be considered as part of the coroner's investigation.

'It will be up to the coroner to establish if more safety procedures need to be put in place (and) whether things like the locking system on the doors need to be looked at,' he said.

The train driver wasn't aware of the accident and continued on his route.

'Sadly this is a case of one risk too many for a group of young people and they've lost one of their friends,' Metro Trains spokeswoman Leah Waymark said.

'The train network is not a fun park for thrill seekers.'
