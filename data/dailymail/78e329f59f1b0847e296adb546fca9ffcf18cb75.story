The flamboyant floral designer whose sudden departure from the White House is blooming into a political intrigue is pictured for the first time - as supporters blamed 'jealous' rivals for her abrupt exit.

Laura Dowling spent six years as the Obama administration's chief florist before quitting last month amid rumors of a rift with the First Lady.

Her departure only became public six weeks later after a Washington Post gossip column claimed that the 55-year-old was 'escorted from the building' after her employment ended without notice.

Mrs Obama's office released a belated statement praising the designer's 'lively and colorful' arrangements - while high-powered lawyers hired by Ms Dowling insisted she had resigned to take on 'exciting new opportunities'. 

The French-trained artisan, pictured outside her Alexandria, Virginia home in a patterned peach raincoat, matching tote, floppy hat and pink trousers, has refused to comment further.

However sources close to Ms Dowling suggested she was upset at having to leave and blamed her demise on the intense rivalry that exists within the small coterie of decorators and designers that serve the White House.

'She is very sad about leaving the White House,' the source told Daily Mail Online, on condition of anonymity.

'She was very proud to work there and this has come as a shock. It's all about jealousy - Laura has not put a foot wrong. 

'She was very hardworking and she has always been professional and passionate about her work. She and her husband have said they can't talk about it now.

'But they've said that when the time comes they will reveal what really happened.' 

Ms Dowling's muted departure was in stark contrast to tributes afforded to other departing White House fixtures such as the Obamas' personal chef, Sam Kass, who was praised for his 'extraordinary legacy' when he left last December.

Her celebrated predecessor, Nancy Clarke, lasted more than 30 years as chief florist, serving six presidential administrations.

Ms Dowling took over the top job in 2009 after competing against several leading designers to create a lavish arrangement for a mock state dinner.

She described her style as 'new floral aesthetic' with a 'chic look of elegance' inspired by woods, meadows, forests and gardens.

Her website promises arrangements that transcend 'fads and trends', however rival florists who continue to provide bouquets to the White House told The Washington Post her 'fussy style' fell out of favor with Mrs Obama.

Francophile: When Dowling was first appointed she was highly regarded for her organic and less formal 'French look'. Her arrangements were found in the formal parts of the White House

Modern and clean aesthetic: Just days before Dowling's departure, the Old Family Dining Room at the White House had been re-opened after being refurbished by the first lady to showcase modern art and design

They pointed to the recent refurbishment of the White House Family Dining room, which includes abstract paintings and a 1950s-inspired carpet, as an illustration of how the First Lady's tastes have moved on. 

Ms Dowling is said to have resigned on February 13 - just days after the 'thoroughly modernized' room was unveiled. She was escorted from the White House by security, sources said.

It wasn't until six weeks later that Mrs Obama's office issued an official statement to say: 'As chief florist, Laura Dowling and her team treated guests of the White House to their beautiful floral arrangements.

'Ms Dowling's creations were always lively and colorful, reflecting not only the season but the unique and historic rooms which they graced. 

'No two arrangements were ever the same and each one left guests with a lasting impression of the elegance and history of the People's House. 

'We are grateful for her contribution over the years and wish her well.' 

The first lady's office released a statement on Tuesday which praised the work of florist Laura Dowling who had unexpectedly departed her post more than a month before

Laura Dowling, who had overseen flower decorations at the White House for six years, is now spending time at home in Alexandria, Virginia (right) and has retained lawyers. 

Within an hour of the First Lady's official confirmation, Ms Dowling release a statement about her sudden departure through heavyweight law firm Sidley Austin, immediately igniting rumors of an impeding legal action. 

'After almost six years as Chief Floral Designer at the White House, I have resigned in order to pursue exciting new opportunities and explore my passion for floral artistry and design,' she said.

'Over the next few weeks and months, I'll be launching a new platform for my work as an author, speaker, instructor and design consultant that builds on the creative ideas and partnerships I've formed during my tenure there. 

'It's been such an honor to work at the White House and I will always be grateful for this incredible opportunity.' Ms Dowling and her husband Robert Weinhagen, 70, live just outside Washington D.C. in Alexandria's wealthy Old Town neighborhood. 

Asked if he could elaborate on his wife's sudden departure from the White House, Mr Weinhagen said on the steps of their smart $900,000 townhouse: 'No, not really'. 

A neighbor told Daily Mail Online: 'I certainly had not heard that she was sacked or escorted from the premises until it came out in the newspaper. 'They are quite private but they are really nice people. They have a very nice garden, obviously.'
