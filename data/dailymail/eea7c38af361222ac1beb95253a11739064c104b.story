A vaccine against shingles could cut the risk of infection by half and reduce complications associated with the condition.

New research has found that vaccine's effectiveness against post-herpetic neuralgia  - nerve pain that occurs at the site of a previous attack of shingles - was 59 per cent.

Shingles is an infection of a nerve 
and the surrounding skin. It is caused by the herpes varicella-zoster 
virus, which also causes chickenpox.

Most
people suffer with chickenpox in childhood, and after the illness has 
disappeared, the virus remains dormant in the nervous system.

The immune system usually keeps the virus in check, but later in life it can be reactivated and cause shingles.

Shingles tends to affect adults over the
age of 50. It is not fully understood why the virus
is reactivated, but it may be due to lowered immunity due to age, 
stress or another underlying condition. 

The lifetime risk of developing shingles
is between ten and 30 per cent but this increases to 50 per cent in 
those aged 85 years or  older.

In the new study, Dr Sinéad Langan and her colleagues 
at the London School of 
Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, studied the medical records of 766,330 
American private healthcare patients aged over 65 between 2007 and 
2009.

The vaccine could reduce much unnecessary pain suffering in the elderyl

They found that while almost 13,000 
participants developed shingles, the vaccine reduced the rate of infection by 48 per cent.

But the research, published in medical journal Public Library of Science, did find that the vaccine was less effective against shingles in older adults with impaired immune systems.

The vaccine is already widely used in the U.S. 
and the UK Department of Health(DoH) is keen to roll out an immunisation programme for everyone aged over 70.

However the DoH has failed to negotiate a large enough contract with manufacturers to enable a national immunisation programme any time soon.

This has put the UK in a unique position – 60,000 doses have been supplied to Britain but there is no fair way of distributing them.

It is not known when a nationwide scheme will be
brought in.

Currently it is possible to get hold of the vaccine, Zostavax, on private prescription for a cost of around £100.

Dr Langan said: ‘This study shows the effectiveness of the herpes zoster vaccine to prevent shingles and post-herpetic neuralgia in a general population of over 65s.

‘Our findings should be taken in to consideration by those developing policy, particularly in the UK where plans to offer the vaccine are being made.’
