Billion-dollar movie franchises encourage production companies to cut lengthy books into multiple movies, but a new study reveals that such plot breaks drag the plot on much longer than it should.

By taking the length of the movies in film series like Harry Potter and The Hunger Games and then dividing it by the number of words in the original books, movies can then be compared by how much theoretical action takes place in each second of the film.Â  The worst offender turned out to be film version of The Hobbit, where the studio decided to split the lengthy book into three movies.

Blogger Mark Lee used his analysis method on OverThinkingIt to show that in doing so, there were only 3.12 words in the book for every second of each film.

Drawn out: The Hobbit (pictured) had the least amount of words per second based on the length of the original book, showing that it may not have needed to be split into three different films

Low numbers: The three Hobbit films (though two are still yet to come out) have far fewer words than each of The Lord of The Rings movies

Setting the precedent: The Lord of the Rings films had far more words per second, largely because each film was based off a single movie and not broken into multiple films

Since the second and third instalments have not been released, he used the length of the first film, titled The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, as a guidepost and divided the number of words in the book version- a whopping 95,022- by three.

The 3.12 words per second statistic means little until it is compared to that of the three films made as counter points to the three books in the series.

The Fellowship of the Rings had 16.59 words per second, The Two Towers had 13.36 per second and The Return of the King had 11.15.

'In a strictly quantitative sense, the three Hobbit movies are laughably lacking in density of source material presented on screen compared to the three Lord of the Rings movies,' Mr Lee wrote in his article on Over Thinking It.

From shelf to screen: Movie studios find it profitable to drag series on for more movies than simply the number of books written on the subject

Even if The Hobbit was made as one film rather than three, the word cound would still be lower than its the Lord of the Rings iterations, with a hypothetical 9.36 words per second.

A breakdown of the word count isn't the only way to tell that the first Hobbit film felt long, as many moviegoers complained about the slow pace and how it felt as if it was purposefully stretched out to make the next to films exciting.

'There's no denying the majesty in Peter Jackson's visuals but he's taken a relatively slim children's book and stretched it beyond the limits,' film critic Richard Roeper said.

Similar to the start: The split finale of Harry Potter had more words than the first two films

Wordsmith: The Harry Potter film series spanned a decade and had a massive following

The Hobbit's sparse dialogue is highlighted even more dramatically when other books that are split into two or more films.

The final Harry Potter book 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' was broken into two films, he first of which had 11.31 words per second and the second which had 12.71.

In a surprising twist, the final Twilight installment- the writing for which was roundly panned- had nearly triple the number of words per second than the expected breakdown for the two-part Hunger Games finale.

While 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay' has not yet been made, Mr Lee subbed in the standard 120-minute movie length to make his calculations.

'I still think this is an interesting way to examine these book-based franchises and how they adapt source material for different media and business needs,' Mr Lee wrote in his article.

@highlight

Final books in popular series are often broken into more than one movie, as seen with Harry Potter, Twilight and The Hunger Games

A new study shows that the decision to do so is largely because studios want to make as much as possible by stretching out the series

In some cases- like The Hobbit, where one book will be turned into three movies- that means that there are very few words per second of film
