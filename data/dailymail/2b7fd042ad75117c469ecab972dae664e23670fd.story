Baking has enjoyed a huge revival in recent years, with Mary Berry and cookery shows causing thousands to dust off their rolling pins and attempt to create the perfect pudding.

However the reality of fast-paced modern life means many of us end up with a lot of unused kitchen gadgets and a last minute dash to the supermarket for that dinner party dessert.

Now, a new kitchen gadget allows you to home cook a variety of desserts in just a few minutes ... using a standard microwave.

The stylish colourful moulds mean you can now create homemade desserts in minutes

Basic ingredients are mixed, pour into the molds and microwaved for an exact period of time depending on the dessert

The One Minute Cake Maker is a set of four little versatile cake moulds that allow you to mix and microwave cakes, mouses, flans and crumbles.

They come with recipes for some classic homemade desserts which vary in the total time they take to make from 8 minutes for an apple crumble to 2 minutes for the lemon mouse.

Most of the desserts require just one minute in the microwave to cook. 

The moulds by Lekue are made of platinum silicone and are easily washable

The little colourful pots actually look quite fashionable and are diet friendly, offering just a small portion of your chosen indulgence and thus limiting calories.

However your diet may be thwarted somewhat by the fact that you can each your dessert straight away, with no long baking or cooling period, so the temptation to cook and scoff several in a row may be high. 

The One Minute Cake Maker is part of a range of Native Microwave products by Lekue and launched by Selfridges which includes a 2 minute omelette maker and a cake-pop mould.

The fast cooking range sold out in the first two weeks of launching at Selfridges, and sales are up 197 per cent on last year.

Chris Gardner, Selfridges Cookshop Buyer comments: 'The Lekue range has been selling like hot cakes since we launched it in store.

'It is perfect for all those budding Paul Hollywoods who feel they just don't have the time to make elaborate cakes  but can produce delicious home-made individual cakes in the microwave in a matter of minutes.

‘It’s the perfect combination of home baking in next to no time. Ideal for interested cooks, who are time poor and kitchen savvy.'

The molds by Lekue are made of platinum silicone and are easily washable.

They are available from Selfridges for £22 for the pack of four.
