Socialite Tamara Ecclestone is a home-loving girl, and so she should be, when that home contains 57 rooms, is worth an estimated £70 million, and stands on the most expensive street in London.

Tamara, the eldest daughter of Formula 1 chief Bernie Ecclestone, has lived in the house with her husband, Jay Rutland, and their five-month-old daughter, Sophia, for a year.

The incredible house - built in the early 1900s - has four storeys above ground and two below and its value has almost doubled since the two-year renovation project she masterminded with London-born but Los Angeles-based designer Gavin Brodin was finished in 2013.

The minute Tamara walked in, she knew the house would be a wonderful family home

'It's rare for these houses to come on the market,' she says. 'The minute I walked in, I knew it would be a wonderful family home. It had a great energy. I felt it could be a home for life.'

That home for life idea was cemented when Sophia was born.

Understandably, Tamara dotes on her beautiful daughter: 'When I was pregnant I said to Jay I was going to breastfeed the baby for maybe two months at the most and then switch to formula milk. My sister breastfed for 14 months and I said, 'No way, Petra, they have teeth!'

Tamara's grade II*-listed house stands on London's most expensive street, Kensington Palace Gardens, where her neighbours include ambassadors and just across the road the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge

'Now I want to breast-feed her for ever. She's had no formula and if I have to give her a bottle of milk that I pumped and I can't do it myself I have an emotional breakdown. I'm that mum stuck in traffic coming home from work and ringing my nanny begging her not to feed Sophia so I can do it when I get home.'

Since the baby's birth the family make the most use of just three rooms.

'We seem to live in three rooms at most: the kitchen, where I make breakfast – that's my forte; the sitting room, to relax and watch TV; and our bedroom where Sophia also has her cot.'

Of her husband she says: 'He has his opinions and tells me if I'm wrong or stupid. I get an honest answer. He's a great dad and a good husband and my best friend. He works in property, finding it, renovating and selling it on. And it's important to me that my dad really gets on with him.'

With a contented marriage and a beautiful daughter, life is good for 30-year-old Tamara Ecclestone who has recently launched a brand of hair-care products called Show Beauty that's sold in Harrods and Selfridges as well as New York and Dubai. That and her charity work keep her busy, busy, busy.

Tamara and her husband Jay Rutland prefer staying at home and having a few friends round for drinks in the garden (above) or to watch the football or Formula 1 in their basement cinema room

Despite living in a 57-room mansion, Tamara and her husband and daughter seem to spend their time in just three rooms: the kitchen,  the sitting room and the bedroom where Sophia also has a cot

The Ecclestones like to have friends over for dinner; this remarkable dining room seats 12
