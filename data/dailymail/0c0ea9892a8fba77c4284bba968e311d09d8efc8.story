A coroner's officer has been suspended over claims she accused the parents of children who died in a maternity hospital scandal of a ‘witch-hunt’.

Liz Gaskell, 40, is under investigation by police after making the accusation in Facebook messages.

The families have spent years trying to discover the truth behind their babies’ deaths at Furness General Hospital in Cumbria, where up to 14 are thought to have died needlessly.

Liz Gaskell, 40, was handling cases of babies who died at Furness General Hospital on behalf of coroner. She is alleged to have sent them Facebook messages telling them to rethink their 'witch-hunt'

They were shocked when Mrs Gaskell, who has handled their cases on behalf of the coroner, sent them messages warning against continuing their campaign.

One, sent earlier this week, tells them to ‘be careful’ what they tell the Press and urges them rethink their ‘witch-hunt’.

It also appears to defend a staff member who is currently under investigation at University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay NHS Trust, which runs the hospital.

The incident calls into question Mrs Gaskell’s impartiality. Last night, a source close to the case said: ‘She’s been friendly towards the families throughout all the proceedings. They thought she was trying to help them, but now they’re not so sure.’

Mrs Gaskell is employed by Cumbria Police and works for the Barrow Coroner Ian Smith.

She is believed to have helped organise the inquests of babies Joshua Titcombe, Elleanor  Bennett, Alex Davey-Brady and Chester Hendrickson, as well  as Chester’s mother Nittaya, 35, who all died at the hospital.

Her  comments came after the Trust’s head of legal services, Ranu Rowan, was suspended over allegations she tried to block Alex’s inquest.

The families have spent years campaigning to find out how their children died at this hospital in Cumbria

It emerged last week that Mrs Rowan wrote an email in 2009 suggesting the coroner might be ‘nudged’ away from holding the hearing.

The revelation provoked an outcry from the families, whom Mrs Gaskell then contacted on Facebook, writing: ‘You guys know how much I care about you and all that you have been through BUT I promise you that Ranu Rowan hasn’t and wouldn’t do anything to cover up or influence a coroner’s inquiry.

‘A crusade for truth and change is turning into a witch-hunt. Please be careful how much you share with the Press … once it’s out there it can’t be undone. I fully support appropriate actions but what’s happening now is awful and wrong.’

Mrs Gaskell has acted as a coroner’s officer for eight years. Yesterday, she said it ‘wouldn’t be appropriate to comment, but I am extremely distressed’.

Cumbria Police said she was under investigation for making the ‘inappropriate’ remarks.

The Trust, which in 2011 had  the highest baby mortality rate in England, will be the subject of an  official inquiry later this year and  up to 30 families are understood to  be taking legal action.

A criminal investigation is still being held  into the death in 2008 of Joshua Titcombe, who had an infection that could easily have been treated with antibiotics.

Earlier this year, the Care Quality Commission was accused of a cover-up after emerged that an internal report about the Trust may have been suppressed.
