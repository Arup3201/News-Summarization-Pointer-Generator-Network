Liam Fox is being tipped as the next Secretary General of Nato more than two years after he quit the Cabinet.

Senior Tories say the former Defence Secretary's name is 'on the table' in Downing Street as a leading candidate for the role.

The current Nato boss, Denmark's Anders Fogh Rasmussen, is due to stand down after the Nato summit in Wales this September.

Supporters say the role, which comes with a tax-free salary of around £180,000, would be perfect for Dr Fox since he already knows the main players throughout Europe from his time running the Ministry of Defence.

He is widely expected to make a return to frontline politics this spring.

In a sign of his close links to Tory high command, Cabinet ministers George Osborne, Iain Duncan Smith and Eric Pickles all attended Dr Fox's new year party at the Carlton Club on Wednesday evening.

David Cameron has not yet decided who Britain will back for the role when discussions on the post are held in July.

But senior Tories close to Downing Street say that Dr Fox, a firm supporter of the Atlantic Alliance, would be a strong contender.

'Liam knows the key people already,' said one source. 'He's probably Nato's biggest supporter in the Commons and he has another big job in him.'

Others suggest that handing the role to Dr Fox would allow Mr Cameron to reward his loyalty since his resignation and remove him from frontline British politics where his calls for more robust action in the EU are seen as potentially awkward for the Prime Minister.

Dr Fox would be expected to take a peerage and resign his seat - North Somerset - where the Tories have a comfortable majority of nearly 8,000 over the Lib Dems.

There is a relatively recent precedent for a former British Defence Secretary taking on the post.

Labour's George Robertson quit Tony Blair's Cabinet after helping to preside over the war in Kosovo.

Dr Fox does not come without baggage after he quit the Cabinet in October 2011 following revelations that his friend Adam Werritty accompanied him on official visits.

Allies of Dr Fox say he would be interested in the role, though some of his friends want him to return to the Cabinet after the European elections in May instead to bolster Mr Cameron's top team.

They want him to replace Ken Clarke as Minister Without Portfolio, acting as a 'Cabinet enforcer' across Government.

A court case he is bringing against American businessman Harvey Boulter, who Dr Fox accused of 'gravely injuring' his reputation during the events leading up to his resignation, is expected to conclude shortly.

Mr Fogh Rasmussen is being touted as a replacement for Herman Van Rompuy, the President of the European Council in Brussels.

A No 10 source said: 'No decisions have been taken.'
