Controversial University of Sydney Professor Barry Spurr has been suspended over a series of inflammatory emails that include derogatory references to Aboriginals, Asians and women.

Professor Spurr - who is the university's Personal Chair in Poetry and Poetics - recently contributed to a review of the national curriculum.

'Professor Spurr is suspended, effective immediately, from teaching and engaging in any other University business and is precluded from attending any University campus, while the matter is investigated,' the university said in a statement. 

Professor Barry Spurr has suspended over a series of emails that label Tony Abbott as an 'abo-lover'

'Racist, sexist or offensive language is not tolerated at the University of Sydney.

'The expectations for our staff and affiliates in respect of their professional and personal conduct are clearly set out in the University's Code of Conduct.'

Daily Mail Australia asked a spokeswoman from the University of Sydney whether Professor Spurr was suspended without pay but was told that 'the university can not make any comments that will jeopardise the investigation process'.

Professor Spurr sparked an investigation into allegations he labelled Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott an 'abo lover' in a string of emails containing racist taunts.

He also allegedly referred to former South African leader Nelson Mandela as a 'darkie' and Archbishop Desmond Tutu as a 'witch doctor', the New Matilda reported. 

The allegations against Professor Spurr, who took charge of examining nationwide English courses, come just days after results of the National Curriculum Review were released.

Other terms used by Professor Spurr in his emails include 'Mussies, Chinky-Poos, bogans and fatsoes'.

In one email published on the news website, the scholar wrote 'Abo Lover Abbott and [Sydney Swans footballer] Adam Goodes' were 'Siamese twins' who could only be separated by undergoing surgery.

He also referred Mr Abbott as 'gutless and hypocritical' in another email as well as criticising the Prime Minister's chief-of-staff Peta Credlin for allowing an 'Abo' singer to entertain Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their visit to iconic Uluru in the Northern Territory in April.

Professor Spurr has defended himself and said the views expressed in the string of emails were not reflective of his own beliefs, Fairfax Media reported. 

He also added that the exchange was a pastime  'that mocked extreme language'.

'The comments that you refer to are largely to one recipient with whom I have had a whimsical linguistic game for many years of trying to outdo one another in extreme statements,' he said in an email seen by The Sydney Morning Herald.

As part of his role in reviewing the national curriculum, Professor Spurr made the recommendation to reduce study into the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander language.

He told the New Matilda they were made with his 'considered professional view and not in any way influenced by these email exchanges which are linguistic play'.

Professor Spurr said he was shocked that anyone would take the language used in the emails seriously as he always treated his students - no matter what background they are from - equally.

Christopher Pyne had responded to the claims and said he was disgusted by the alleged slurs

A spokesman for Education Minister Christopher Pyne said the MP was disgusted by the alleged slurs made by Professor Spurr and said the selection of the scholar to take part in the review was not made by the government.

'The minister utterly rejects and finds repugnant the denigration of any minority on the basis of their sex, race, sexual orientation or beliefs,' the spokesman told Fairfax Media.

The University of Sydney said it was 'deeply disturbed' by the revelations involving one of its academic staff members sending offensive emails.

'The university takes the allegations very seriously and is examining whether any breaches of its Code of Conduct have occurred,' a statement on its website said.

'This code clearly sets out the university's expectations for our staff and affiliates in respect of their professional and personal conduct. 

'In particular, the code requires that members of staff "act fairly and reasonably, and treat [people] with respect, impartiality, courtesy and sensitivity".

'Racist, sexist or offensive language is not tolerated at The University of Sydney.'

Daily Mail Australia has approached Professor Barry Spurr and Christopher Pyne for comment on this matter.
