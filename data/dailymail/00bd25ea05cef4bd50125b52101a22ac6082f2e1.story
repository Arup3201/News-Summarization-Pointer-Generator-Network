Judge Mike Maggio posted details of actress Charlize Theron's adoption online has been barred for life

A judge who posted details of actress Charlize Theron's adoption online and complained about wives who wouldn't have sex has been barred for life 

The state Supreme Court accepted the lifetime ban that was agreed to by Faulkner County Circuit Judge Mike Maggio and the Arkansas Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission.  

The disciplinary panel ruled last month that, using the pseudonym 'geauxjudge,' Maggio entered an online forum of Louisiana State University sports fans and shared details from Theron's 2012 adoption of a baby in the same court division where he served. 

Comments in January 2012 divulged details of Theron's adoption two months before she publicly released the information, while others talked about women in a derogatory way and another likened bestiality to sex in the transgender and gay communities. 

He said a 'judge friend' handled the case, before admitting that he was also involved in the case. 

When a poster asked if she had adopted a black child, he said that she had.

Such proceedings are confidential in Arkansas, and there are no cases in the state's online court records that mention Theron's name. Her publicist, Amanda Silverman, declined to comment.

In a June 2011 posting, 'geauxjudge' suggested that women who seek divorces after their husbands cheat may be better off financially by staying married. In Arkansas, circuit judges like Maggio handle divorce cases, among other civil and criminal casework.

Revealed: He divulged that Charlize Theron had adopted a son two months before she announced it publicly in 2012. She is pictured in 2013 with the boy, Jackson, whom she adopted from South Africa

'I see it everyday,' he wrote. 'A woman makes (an) emotional decision to divorce because the husband stepped out. When otherwise he was a good provider, father, and husband.

'Then a year or two later realizes uh oh I am worse off financially, emotionally and relationship wise but hey they showed that SOB. Too many times the women get their advice from other divorced women.'

In another, Maggio, who has three sons and two daughters from a previous relationship and lives with his partner, Dawn, made derogatory comments about women, saying they needed to take care of a man's two basic needs for sex and food, adding: 'It takes two to pull the wagon'. 

Confidential: Postings on the website TigerDroppings.com show him discussing confidential information

Responding to a story about a woman who was arrested for allegedly having sex with a dog, 'geauxjudge' wrote that it was 'just a small step' from having 'TGGLBS' sex, an apparent reference to transgender, gay, lesbian or bisexual sex.

And in 2012, he suggested that people can beat a drunken-driving charge by not cooperating with police and expressed a desire to obtain evidence photos from a case involving a cheerleader accused of sex with a minor.

In a 2009 post about divorce, Maggio wrote he was tired of hearing complaints that husbands work all the time while a wife withholds sex and becomes unattractive and non-supportive. 'What did she think was going to happen....,' he wrote. 

Today the state Supreme Court e court rejected the panel's recommendation that he be suspended with pay until his term expires at the end of 2014, and instead ordered his immediate removal from the bench.

'We deem any further suspension with pay to be inappropriate,' the court said in its order.

'Therefore, we order the removal of Judge Maggio from judicial office, effective as the date of this opinion.

'By this order, Judge Maggio is henceforth prohibited from holding any judicial office in the state of Arkansas.'

Maggio, who has been a judge since 2001, dropped his bid for a seat on the state Court of Appeals earlier this year after admitting to the posts.

Justices also accepted the panel's decision to, in exchange for Maggio agreeing to step aside, drop its look at an Ethics Commission complaint that ended with Maggio paying a $750 fine to settle allegations he received improper campaign contributions.

The disciplinary panel opened an investigation March 3 after the Blue Hog Report website noted a series of posts appeared to be coming from Maggio.

Maggio subsequently tried to delete or edit some of the material.

Maggio's attorney did not immediately return a call seeking comment Thursday.
