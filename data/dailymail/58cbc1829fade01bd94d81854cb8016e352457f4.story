A former airline pilot accused of murdering his wife by deliberately crashing his car into a tree faked unconsciousness when emergency services tried to assist him, a court has heard.

Iain Lawrence, 53, is accused of murdering his estranged wife Sally Lawrence, 47, because he had not come terms with the break up of their marriage.

Prosecutors allege Mrs Lawrence's seatbelt was unclipped before the crash and her airbag had been disabled.

A court sketch shows Iain Lawrence in the dock at Leicester Crown Court where he is on trial accused of murdering his wife Sally, right, by deliberately crashing his car into a tree with her in the passenger seat

Gartree Road near Leicester, where Mrs Lawrrence died. The court heard the passenger's side airbag had been turned off

Today Peter Hawkin, a retired 
firefighter, told the jury at Leicester Crown Court that Lawrence had 
his eyes shut in the driver's seat 'like a child' when he stopped at the
scene to help.

Describing Lawrence, Hawkin told the 
court: 'It was as if a child was squeezing his eyes shut pretending to 
be asleep. He was squeezing but the eye was twitching.'

Nirmal Shant QC, prosecuting, asked him: 'Was he unconscious?'

'No,' Mr Hawkin replied.

'Was that the impression that was being given that he was unconscious?' Miss Shant continued.

'I believe so in my opinion,' Mr Hawkin answered.

In police interviews after the crash, 
Lawrence claimed to have no memory of what had happened or of getting 
into his red Peugeot car at the start of the journey, the court has 
heard.

Mr Hawkin told the court he assessed Mrs Lawrence and believed her to be seriously injured.

'I did suspect (she was dead) because 
of the pallor and having experience, looking at the scene, looking at 
the individual I knew it wasn't good.'

He added: 'By looking at her, I knew it was too late.'

Lawrence is alleged to have adopted 
the brace position while his wife, who was not wearing a seatbelt, died 
almost instantly in the crash on Gartree Road, in Oadby, Leicestershire 
at around 6.30pm on October 6 last year, the prosecution claims.

The Lawrences' Â£300,000 family home in Oadby, which the couple still shared. The court heard they had an 'acrimonious' discussion about the division of their assets the day before the crash

Today the court heard from a collision
expert who said his examination of the road and tyre marks showed 
Lawrence's car had travelled straight towards the tree.

Police constable Timothy O' Donnell, a
forensic collision investigator from Leicestershire Police, said: 'The 
Peugeot began to negotiate the left hand bend. It has to have made a right turn (to generate the tyre marks).

'But the marks are two straight lines that is telling me that there is no longer right hand drive applied.

'It's a straight path. Straight towards the tree,' he concluded.

He also said he could find no evidence of tyre grinding and no feathering to the tyres to suggest emergency braking.

The officer said friction marks on the
seatbelts suggested Lawrence had been wearing his at the time of the 
impact but that his wife's was either not plugged in correctly or that 
she was not wearing it.

Moving on to the airbags, Mr O'Donnell
told the jury the driver's airbag had deployed successfully while the 
passenger's had not.

On examination of the vehicle, the officer could find no fault with the airbag system, he told the court.

He said the gear lever of the car was in fifth gear when he examined it and the speedometer stuck at 54mph.

Mr O'Donnell also told the court that 
visibility would have been good at the time of the incident and that the
road surface had been dry.

Lawrence, who was not seriously injured in the crash, denies a single count of murder.

The jury has heard Mrs Lawrence, who 
had instigated divorce proceedings, had told friends she feared her 'calm and cold' husband would try to kill her.

She died a day after 'locking horns' 
with her husband over how to divide up their assets - and just two days 
before the first stage of the divorce was due to be granted.

Mr Lawrence was still living with his 
wife at their matrimonial home in Ring Road, Leicester, at the time of 
the crash, although they were leading separate lives.

The prosecution alleges her death was 'a planned killing born out of grief, anger and jealousy'.

The trial continues.
