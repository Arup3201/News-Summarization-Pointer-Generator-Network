Mayweather has promised to put on a boxing masterclass in Las Vegas on Saturday night and said his opponent fully deserves a rematch against the American superstar.

The pair originally fought back in May, when Mayweather controversially won by split-decision to extend his unbeaten professional record to 46 bouts.

'I know I'm almost 40 but I'm still going strong,' said Mayweather. 'I still feel good and I want to go out there and perform. I'm going to give you guys what you want to see.

'[Maidana] is always in tip-top shape. Does he deserve a rematch? Absolutely. I commend him and I commend his team for stepping up to the plate and making it happen again.'
