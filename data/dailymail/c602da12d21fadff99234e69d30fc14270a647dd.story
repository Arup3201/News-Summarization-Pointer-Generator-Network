A woman desperate to become the world's biggest bride has embarked upon a 30,000 calorie a day diet in order to achieve her dream.

Susanne Eman, 33, weighs in at a staggering 520lbs - but says she needs to fatten up for her wedding day.

Unlike 
most figure-conscious brides-to-be, in preparation for her final wedding dress fitting, Susanne feasted on an enormous 
breakfast of pancakes, Belgian waffles, hash browns, sausage links, 
steak, and a giant 12-egg omelette.

Larger than life: Susanne Eman, the 800lb mother who is half way to reaching the record for being the fattest woman has been fitted for her wedding gown ahead of her nuptials to chef Parker Clack

Tucking in: The mother of two eats three guacamole bacon cheeseburgers, two orders of chili cheese fries, nine tacos, a chocolate shake and a large Coke

On the day of her appointment with 
the 
seamstress, Susanne and her sister Cassie, who will be Susanne's 
maid-of-honour when she marries her chef boyfriend, Parker Clack, 35, 
later this year, made a pit stop for snacks, arriving at the 
dressmaker's with a spread of three guacamole bacon 
cheeseburgers, two orders of chili cheese fries, nine tacos, a chocolate
shake and a large Coke.

The monumental challenge of making a 
dress to fit the bride's XXXXXXXXXL figure was given to dressmaker Judee
Goff, who calculated after measuring Susanne that she would need 45ft 
of fabric to complete the dress.

Now Judee has designed
the world's largest wedding gown for her larger than life client, using endless billowing lengths of chiffon
and lace to cover Susanne's colossal curves.

The one-off gown is so large it takes three people to carry it, and half an hour to lace up at the back.

Seamstress
Judee, from Paradise Fabrics in Phoenix, Arizona, said: 'Right now, it 
just fits snugly, and if she gains weight it will lace up looser in the
back.

'We've never made a dress like this before. There are no dress patterns this large.'

Susanne said: 'When I tried the dress on, it was amazing, I felt like a bride.

Love at first bite: Susanne Eman and Parker Clack met online and bonded over their shared love of food

Happiness: The morbidly obese heavyweight believes that her goal of becoming the fattest human will remove the stigma that fat is bad seeing as she believes she is healthy, her sons are happy and she has found love

Susanne's
sister Cassie said: 'I think she looks
really beautiful in it. The dress turned out amazing.'

She said: 'I've never been married before and this is the first time I've tried on a wedding dress.

'Parker hasn't seen me in it, but he's seen photos and says I look beautiful.

'He
hasn't formally proposed with a ring yet, as he wants to surprise me. 
But we've agreed we're getting married, and he's just waiting for the 
right moment.'

Susanne, who has given herself ten years to eat her way into the Guinness Book of Records, had believed until recently that she weighed nearly 800lbs after spending a year
gorging on fast food, cakes, pasta, pizza, crisps and fatty
snacks.

Fit? Ms Eman tries to stay mobile and healthy by swimming and 'waddling' and though her doctors warn her against pursuing her dream of creaking the record, she believes she in no danger

Incapacitated: Susanne's sister Cassie, who will be maid-of-honour on Susanne's big day, has to push her sister in a wheelchair to the dress fitting

But after recently being weighed 
on special obesity scales, Susanne discovered to her disappointment that her weight was actually 520lbs - almost 1,000lbs short of her goal weight of 1,600lbs.

Now Susanne has her own goal for the
big day: to put on weight. In order to ekep gaining the pounds, Susanne must eat 30,000 calories a day, which she gets from meals cooked for her by her husband-to-be.

Susanne's doctor is opposed to his patient's morbid missionÂ  - but Susanne believes she can reach her target weight 
without endangering her life.

Susanne says she wants to try to 'break the stigma that 
being fat is bad'.

'It's helped me to find love, so what's wrong with 
that?' she said.

Now that she has her wedding gown in 
her sights, Susanne is hoping her chef boyfriend Parker will formally 
propose so they can start planning their big day.

Customising: Seamstress Judy Goff has to use about 45 feet of fabric to make the dress for the Arizona native

Sizeable: Ms Eman's waist measures a staggering 107.5in, or nine feet, around making this surely one of the biggest wedding dresses ever made

'It's amazing to have something designed especially for me. Normally I just buy my clothes from plus-size stores online.

'I talked over designs with the dressmaker and she came up with a dress I've always dreamed of.

After having the girth of her 9ft 
waist measured, Susanne tried on veils and head pieces, talking 
excitedly about her expectations for the wedding.

'I'm feeling like a bride. I can't 
wait,' she gushed. 'I like an off-whitish, not completely white. Because
if I wear completely white, I guarantee I'm going to spill something on
it.'

'I
can't wait for Parker to buy me a ring so we can start planning a 
wedding date, and things like the flowers, venue, and the cake.'

Susanne, who earns a living by posting photographs for male fans online, met Parker over the internet last year.

'I felt like a real bride!' Susanne was overwhelmed with emotion when she tried on the fabric for her wedding dress

After sharing emails and phone calls, the couple began dating, and Parker moved in to Susanne's apartment a few months later.

Now
the couple are inseparable, and Parker, who is currently looking for 
work, spends his days making delicious dishes, including his signature 
spaghetti bolognese, for Susanne.

He said: 'Susanne looked beautiful 
in her dress. I love big women, but I do worry about her health and I 
try to make sure she eats some salad and does her exercises.

While details of the catering menu 
for the big event is not known, the couple insist that despite the 
gargantuan quantity of food consumed by Susanne, she likes to eat 
healthily.

Mr Clack has said of her ambition: 'I support her because it makes her happy, and I love big women.

'I
do worry about her health of course, but I try to make sure she eats 
some healthy food like salad, and I make sure she does exercises. She's 
taken up swimming since we met and we love to swim together.'

'I want her to be around for a long time after our wedding.'

Susanne,
who has two sons, Gabriel, 16, and Brendin, 12, added: 'I'd love to 
have a nice wedding somewhere local, not too big and not too small, but 
with all my family and friends around me.'

Tight fit: Susanne struggles into her car on the way to her appointment with the dressmaker

Vast: Judy Goff unrolls 15 feet of fabric but will need three times that amount to make a dress even despite the fact that it will be sleeveless as per the bride's wishes
