A mother who police say stormed into a
 classroom of five- and six-year-olds and stabbed their teacher to death
 has been charged with murder.

The
 47-year-old suspect, who was quickly arrested, has been named by French
 police as Rachida H. is being held in a psychiatric unit after being 
judged 'mentally disturbed'.

Parents
 and pupils have been visiting the Edouard Herriot school in Albi, 
south-west France, to lay flowers and cards for Fabienne Calmes, a 
34-year-old mother of two girls.

Teacher Fabienne Calmes - a 34-year-old mother of two little girls (pictured with her family above) - died after being stabbed in the abdomen at the Edouard Herriot school in the town of Albi in south west France

Mrs Calmes was stabbed in front of her five and six-year-old pupils

Mrs Calmes' attacker shouted 'I'm not a thief' before stabbing her

She
 went into cardiac arrest after she was stabbed in the abdomen and died 
shortly after. It was the last day before the summer holidays.

Doctors
 said Rachida H., who is unemployed, was suffering from delusions of 
persecution and could not yet answer for her actions, the Telegraph 
reported.

She may be kept in hospital indefinitely if she is judged mentally unfit for trial, the paper cited legal sources as saying.

On
 Friday, it is claimd, she had burst into the classroom screaming 'I'm 
not a thief' before plunging a six-inch kitchen knife into Ms Calmes' 
belly.

Claude Derens, the
 Albi prosecutor, told AFP on Friday: 'When I arrived on the scene, they
 were still trying to revive her. She was in cardiac arrest.'

Police said the suspect then attempted to escape but was caught around 20 minutes later close to the school grounds.

The
 Moroccan-born woman, who holds Spanish nationality, has a police record
 for child neglect and not reporting a runaway child, French radio 
reported.

Location: The killing happened at a school in the Lapanouse area of Albi which has 284 pupils aged three to 11

In
 the immediate aftermath of the killing, Benoit Hamon, France's 
education minister, paid tribute to Ms Calmes. Using her maiden name, he
 said: 'I want to pay tribute to the memory of Fabienne Terral-Calmes.

'She
 was 34, a school teacher, mother to two little girls, Romane et Adele, 
who have lost their mummy. And the national education system has lost a 
formidable teacher.'

The attack took place around 9am at the school in the Lapanouse area of the town which has 284 pupils aged from three to 11.

The
 murderer fled the scene of the crime. Around 20 minutes later police 
arrested Rachida H. her near her home. The victim’s time of death was 
11am.

Police did not 
immediately release details of the suspect's identity on Friday, but 
said she was last year spoken to by police about neglecting a child 
under 15, and attempting to delay a search for a missing child.

She faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted of murder.

Francois Hollande also condemned a ‘horrible tragedy’.

President
 François Hollande described the killing as a 'horrific tragedy' and 
despatched Education Minister Benoit Hamon to the school.

There have only been four known cases of teachers being killed in class in France over the past three decades.

The
 last was in 1995 when 51-year-old English teacher Michel Antoine was 
beaten to death in the south west town of Dax by two students, one of 
whom had just failed his exams. Both murderers ended up serving ten 
years in prison.

In October 
2012 a father was sentenced to three years in prison, with 18 months 
suspended, for hitting a Lyon gym teacher with a truncheon.

The
 latest killing came as France's national statistics agency, Insee, 
revealed that 12 per cent of teachers and other education staff had 
suffered threats and other forms of abuse in class.A further 0.6 per 
cent reported actual physical attacks.
