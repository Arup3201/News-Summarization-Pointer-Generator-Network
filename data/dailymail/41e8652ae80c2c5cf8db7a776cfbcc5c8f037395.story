Lewis Hamilton walked disconsolately back from his parked car, an oil leak having ended his participation on the wind-blown tarmac of the Second World War airfield called Silverstone.

That was the scene on Friday afternoon in practice for the British Grand Prix — a race that, should Hamilton win, would act as balm for the national sporting mood after our cricketers, our footballers, our rugby players have fallen to defeat home and abroad this year.

He had completed just 14 laps in the session, compared to the 35 of his Mercedes team-mate and world championship rival Nico Rosberg. ‘The car was feeling pretty good,’ Hamilton said. ‘I just missed the most important run.

‘It happens,
 but I don’t know why it happens to my car so much. I really needed 
that. I can’t keep stopping, but we’ll learn from these experiences.’

Yet,
 in what Hamilton’s supporters will hope is a happy portent ahead of 
qualifying and the race on Sunday, he was still top of the 
timesheets by 0.288 of a second.

Rain
 is forecast for this part of Northamptonshire over the weekend, during 
which Silverstone’s rich history will be celebrated.

A
 parade of old cars, driven by old stars, will be part of it. It will 
link the first race here in 1948 — the RAC International — to the 
present day, the 50th staging of a grand prix.

Back
 in those post-war days straw bales marked much of the circuit. Now the 
TV cables are so extensive they would stretch from Dover to Calais and 
back.

Cool Britannia: Lewis Hamilton would have benefited if Nico Rosberg was given a grid penalty

We sit in The Wing — a £27million extravagance — where there was once open space, the hum of  Wellingtons refusing to die.

On Saturday a couple of Spitfires, their beautiful Merlin engines, the purr of perfection, will fly over the  circuit.

Speaking
 of engine noise, this will be the first time that the new hybrids will 
have been heard live by most of the 300,000 weekend audience.

Hamilton is joining in with the patriotic theme, wearing a Union Flag on the underside of his cap peak.

‘It’s always a special weekend for us British drivers,’ he said. ‘Winning this race is like winning an Olympic gold medal.

‘Coming
 here, seeing the fans, having already been at Goodwood (for the 
Festival of Speed) and seeing how many people were there and the support
 coming into this weekend, it’s very exciting, the feeling of being at 
home is really a great one.

‘The
 support, as I say, for me and Jenson Button and the guys here, it’s 
unlike any other place we experience. We are going to do our utmost to 
try to represent and perform for the country.

‘With
 Mercedes as a leading team, hopefully we’ll have a good shot this 
weekend. I’ll do everything I can to bring at least a little bit of joy 
and add to the great success that some of the top athletes have had.’

Standing in his way is Rosberg, the blond assassin who leads him at the top of the standings by 29 points.

The
 German was calmness personified in his post-practice interviews on Friday. Rarely has a Formula One driver been more assured and more 
focused than this man.

By
 this point in late afternoon, he knew he was in the clear despite 
overtaking the Red Bull of Daniel Ricciardo under a red flag in the 
first session.

Button
 had been moved three places back on the grid for the same infraction in
 America last year, but the stewards here — including the crowd’s old 
favourite Nigel Mansell — deemed that he was not to blame because 
Ricciardo had slowed to 24mph in a ‘very unusual manner’ and he had 
taken ‘reasonable avoiding action’.

Hamilton is taking tablets for hay fever. ‘Everything comes from the doctor and is FIA approved,’ he said.

‘When
 I was kid I had a severe allergy. I remember doing my GCSEs and sitting
 there with a big box of tissues and everyone was getting on with the 
exams and I was blowing my nose all the way through.

‘I’ve tried every medicine on the market since I was 10 and I only take it when I really, really need it.

‘I
 haven’t driven with hay fever for a while but it is just this weekend 
being in England with the weather having been great and the pollen high.
 I will be fine.’

The
 two men see only as much of each other as their jobs demand. Hamilton 
is staying at his father’s house in Tewin Wood, driving in each day.

Rosberg is sleeping on site in his motorhome. ‘Glamping’ is the new word for it — a contraction of ‘glamorous camping’.

Each
 of them is trying to find the fractional advantages that can be found 
in the minute details. ‘You are looking everywhere to make a difference 
but the other guy is too,’ said Hamilton.

‘Everything
 is transparent. He knows everything. Nico and I work quite well 
together. We are battling each other fiercely, but when Nico does his 
debrief he says all that he has to say and vice-versa.

'But
 on the track there are things you hope will give you time. He might 
take an apex early for example and hope that I don’t see that in data 
and vice-versa.’

Can
 anyone possibly stop either of these two? Without the intervention of 
the weather it is hard to see how. The Mercedes is too quick for all the
 rest.

That
 is what makes this a fascinating mano a mano contest. The stakes are 
even higher because if Hamilton does not win the title this year, one 
wonders whether he ever will again.

But
 the season is only into its ninth round of 19 and there is time for 
Rosberg’s successful run to be stopped, just as Hamilton’s early form 
was.

Hamilton
 said: ‘The tables turned against me in Monaco and broke my momentum. 
He’s had it for a few races and now it’s time to do the same thing the 
other way round.

‘It’s
 still early days but there is never a point where you can be too 
relaxed and think there is a long way to go because there will be a time
 when it is too late.

‘There
 is no time like the present and this is the best place to do it. It is 
almost like a sailing boat that needs a gust of wind to change 
direction. I hope that the British Grand Prix and the fans can do that 
for me.
