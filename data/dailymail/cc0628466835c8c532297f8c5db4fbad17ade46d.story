Christmas was ruined for tens of thousands of passengers caught up in train chaos when botched engineering work over-ran, a damning report said today.

More than 115,000  people faced 'widespread confusion, frustration, disruption, discomfort and anxiety' in the Christmas rail engineering overruns, the rail regulator said.

Network Rail came under fire for late-finishing work over the festive period which hit services into King's Cross, Paddington and Finsbury Park stations in London.

Passengers were left in tears in some cases with hundreds of journeys ruined by the overrunning works. The disruption caused chaos at King's Cross, Paddington and at Finsbury Park where there was overcrowding

Queues formed at Finsbury Park station, because of the closure of Kings Cross station due to overrunning maintenance work

East Coast mainline services into King’s Cross were halted over Christmas for the works between the terminus and Finsbury Park in north London. 

When they over-ran into the weekend there was chaos as services between Scotland, the North East and London were cancelled.

Those that ran were massively overcrowded and delayed, while suburban Finsbury Park station failed to cope with the crowds.  The crush was so great at one stage that passengers were unable to disembark.

Some services were ushered into King’s Cross by railmen waving red and yellow flags.

The Office Of Rail Regulation (ORR) said the catalogue of problems led to 'unacceptable' service levels.  

'Passengers were really let down,' said ORR's railway markets and economics director Joanna Whittington.

The ORR report into the disruption, affecting services on Saturday December 27 and Sunday December 28, follows NR's own critical report last month which acknowledged the company's failings. 

In today's report the ORR said:

The ORR made a number of recommendations to ensure 'that in future passengers do not suffer the same experience'.

Engineers were forced to use red and yellow flags to signal trains in and out of the station today as the chaos at King's Cross station continued

The report said: 'Passengers who travel between Christmas and the new year include families with young children, the elderly and vulnerable often travelling with lots of luggage in an unfamiliar environment.

'Over the two days we estimate that more than 115,000 passengers were affected in some way by this disruption. '

The report went on: 'There were impressive examples of good service from individual members of staff but the overall service passengers received was not acceptable.

'It led to widespread confusion, frustration, disruption, discomfort and anxiety.'

Ms Whittington said: 'NR has rightly acknowledged it didn't do enough for passengers affected by overrunning engineering works at King's Cross and Paddington this Christmas.

NR chief executive Mark Carne, who was criticised for not returning from his holiday home in Cornwall when the problems occurred, repeated his apology today

'While the company generally has a good record for delivering engineering work on time, in this instance passengers were really let down.'

She went on: 'Our investigation found that contingency planning did not fully consider the impact of potential overruns on passengers and that this needs to change.

'In future, plans will address the impact on passengers as well as engineering and train operation issues. NR cannot achieve this alone, train operators will also need to play their part.'

Ms Whittington added: 'NR has committed to ensuring all work undertaken this Easter has a contingency plan which is fit for purpose, and to implement all recommendations in time for engineering works planned over Christmas 2015.

'ORR will audit its progress, to ensure that passengers' needs and safety are central to NR's and train operator contingency arrangements.'

NR chief executive Mark Carne, who was criticised for not returning from his holiday home in Cornwall when the problems occurred, repeated his apology today.

He said: 'Putting passengers at the heart of our planning is absolutely the right thing to do and we recognise that we let people down during the disruption experienced on December 27 and 28.

'Over Christmas, we undertook the biggest programme of engineering and investment work ever, upgrading train lines across the country. The overwhelming majority of this work went to plan but in the case of King's Cross and Paddington we accept we got things wrong.

'Our own report has caused us to look again at the work we have planned this year and the contingency plans we have in place and the ORR's report underlines the necessity of this work.'

House of Commons Transport Committee chairman Louise Ellman said: 'NR must implement the ORR's recommendations in full so that passengers do not face avoidable disruption and chaos.

'The scenes at Christmas were unacceptable. Bad planning, the failure of contingency arrangements and breakdown in communication resulted in thousands of people waiting for hours in the cold outside Finsbury Park station, or stuck on delayed trains.'

She went on: 'The rail sector must work together to ensure that NR's planning and communication improves. NR's investment programme for 2014/19 means that more major and complex engineering work will need to take place. NR must learn from their errors to regain the confidence of the public.' 

Shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher said: 'Over 100,000 passengers were affected by the rail chaos over the Christmas period. We now know that David Cameron's Government was warned and failed to act.

'While it is clear that NR needs to learn lessons, out of touch ministers must learn from their failure too.'

Passengers on trains to Edinburgh from London, one of the worst affected routes yesterday, complained of overcrowding as they were forced to stand in aisles and sit on the floor despite purchasing tickets

He went on: 'It is also increasingly evident that there needs to be big reforms to the running of our railway so that we have a rail service that is fit for purpose.

'The ORR is right to say that the rail industry must place passengers at the heart of enhanced contingency planning. Labour has argued consistently that passengers must be given a proper voice in the running of the railway, so that they are at the centre of the way in which the industry is run.'

Michael Roberts, director general of the Rail Delivery Group which represents operators and NR, said: 'Major projects like those completed over Christmas are crucial to improving the railway.

'But many passengers did not get the service they deserved in the days following Christmas and for that we are very sorry. NR and operators are working closely together to avoid making the same mistakes again.'

He added: 'Passengers are our primary focus and it is vital that the industry provides them with accurate and timely information, particularly during disruption.

'In the coming months train operators will be publishing individual plans to improve customer communications.' 

Manuel Cortes, leader of the TSSA rail union, said: 'This report reveals that the post-Christmas chaos was such a shambles because NR tried to substitute a small suburban station, Finsbury Park, for mainline King's Cross which has 12 platforms.

'Any schoolboy knows you cannot get a quart into a pint pot. For some reason, no one at the top of NR seemed to know that basic fact.

'When they tried to ignore this very basic sum, tens of thousands of passengers had their holidays ruined.'

David Sidebottom, director at rail customer watchdog Passenger Focus, said: 'Thousands of passengers were left angry and frustrated when trying to travel at Christmas.

'We heard of passengers standing for hours on trains, locked outside stations and left to find out what to do by themselves.'

He went on: 'This cannot happen again. We welcome this report from the regulator, which echoes our call for industry to put passengers' experience right at the heart of planning, especially for plans to cope and compensate when things go wrong.' 

Transport Secretary Patrick McLoughlin said: 'Passengers should be at the heart of everything the rail industry does. The industry must learn lessons to avoid any repeat of the completely unacceptable disruption we saw in December.

'NR and the operators are delivering essential improvements that we are investing in as part of our long-term economic plan. However, it is vital they ensure these works are properly planned and any impacts to services are communicated to passengers.'

People faced 'widespread confusion, frustration, discomfort and anxiety' 

@highlight

The planning of the King's Cross work did not take proper account of the impact of failing to hand back a working line on December 27;

@highlight

A contingency plan developed on the evening of Boxing Day was ineffective and resulted in Finsbury Park becoming so overcrowded it had to be closed for a time;

@highlight

Reporting of the progress of the works at Paddington was inaccurate so that the operational contingency plan was not enacted until many passengers had already been severely delayed.
