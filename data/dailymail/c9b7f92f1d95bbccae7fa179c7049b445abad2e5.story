A 29-year-old mother has been chased 10km across Sydney by two men in a terrifying incident which culminated in her being forced to use an umbrella for defence.

Two men of African appearance, aged between 18 and 22, tried to grab a woman named Meryln at Wolli Creek station in southern Sydney at around 11pm on Tuesday.

The Filipino woman, who has a 4-year-old son, initially managed to escape them and boarded a train after they followed her onto the platform.

'He followed me, chasing me, grabbing me,' she told the Daily Telegraph.

She switched trains at Turella and got off around 30 minutes later near her home in Beverly Hills but was shocked to discover the men had followed her the whole way.

One of them, who called her 'babe' chased her along King Georges Road as she frantically called for help.

She was saved by another woman who was passing by and picked her up in her car.

Police are investigating the incident.Â
