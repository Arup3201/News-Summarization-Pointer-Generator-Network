Court documents reveal a huge network of drug dealers that included outlaw bikers, the Canadian Mafia and a Mexican drug cartel responsible for supplying New York City with nearly a billion dollars in marijuana was taken down by the Drug Enforcement Agency and Canadian authorities.

The illicit network’s ringleader is French Canadian drug kingpin Jimmy ‘Cosmo’ Cournoyer, authorities say.

Cournoyer was caught last spring after stepping off a jet in Mexico.

Alleged accomplice: Jimmy Cournoyer's model girlfriend Amelia Racine reportedly let him use her Porsche Cayenne to dodge police surveillance

A five-year probe carried out by the DEA and police from Laval, Quebec, where Cournoyer once lived, shows that his network allegedly specialized in growing and distributing potent hydroponic marijuana harvested in British Columbia, according to the New York Post.

The supply of marijuana under his authority was transported in motor homes and trucks across Canada with aid from the Hells Angels, authorities said.

The biker gang and the Montreal mob then smuggled the marihuana from Quebec into upstate New York, where trucks delivered it to a warehouse in Brooklyn, authorities and sources said.

Cournoyer, 33, reportedly earned enough from his illegal operations to fund a lavish lifestyle, including model girlfriend, Amelia Racine, and extravagant parties that attracted unknowing celebrities, Leonardo DiCaprio among them.

Cournoyer is now awaiting trial in Brooklyn federal court for organizing the ‘vast international drug-trafficking enterprise that has been in existence for more than a decade,’ prosecutor Steven Tiscione wrote in recent court papers.

‘The illegal narcotics distributed worldwide by members of the criminal enterprise have a retail value of more than $1 billion, conservatively,’ Tiscione wrote.

The Canadian kingpin had attempted to throw off surveillance teams in Quebec by hiding his expensive Bugatti Veyron in a garage and driving around in a Porsche Cayenne owned by his girlfriend Racine, a Canadian-Brazilian brunette who has worked modelling gigs in Europe, sources told the Post.

Cournoyer’s gal pal’s jailed brother, Mario Racine, was allegedly acting as the kingpin’s trusted lieutenant.

Mario Racine is now awaiting extradition to stand trial with his boss in Brooklyn, officials say.

After his arrest last spring, Cournoyer reportedly refused to board a U.S.-bound commercial airplane to the states while throwing a series of tantrums.

Those tantrums forced a total of four plane changes over two days before Cournoyer was finally flown to New York City to await his trial.

One of the Canadian kingpin’s biggest clients in New York was reputed Bonanno crime-family member John ‘Big Man’ Venizelos, who is now out on bail in the case, according to sources and court documents.

Millions of dollars generated from Cournoyer’s marijuana sales were used to buy cocaine from Joaquin Guzmán Loera, the leader of the notorious Sinaloa drug cartel, according to federal authorities.

The alleged sale of the cocaine supplied by Guzmán then further financed Cournoyer’s marijuana operations in Canada.
