This is the moment when a city centre came to a standstill as a group of superheroes began dancing along the street.

Despite looking like some form of film production, it was in fact a wedding proposal where Matthew Hill asked girlfriend Jamie-Lee Johnson to marry him.

Mr Hill was dressed as Batman when he went down on one knee, before the group of superheroes and asked for Ms Johnson's hand in marriage.

Jamie-Lee Johnson was sitting in a Cardiff cafe when the Belle from Beauty and the Beast asked her to step outside

The 22-year-old dancer was greeted by a group of dancers, performing a flashmob

The epic proposal began when Ms Johnson was whisked away from a cafe by Belle from Beauty and the Beast.

A dancing flashmob then followed her through the city's streets before Mr Hill, dressed as Batman, appears from behind a group of super hero friends with ring in hand.

Despite the shock, Ms Johnson didn't hesitate to say yes as a large gathered crowd cheered.

Mr Hill, 28, is originally from Abertillery but now lives in Brean, Somerset with his girlfriend, said he chose to propose through flash mob because he wanted a day that neither of them would ever forget.

'I really wanted to make something special and memorable and this combines things we both love.

'Jamie is a dancer and loves Disney and I love super heroes. I chose to propose in Cardiff because Wales is my home and I love it.

'I wanted somewhere grand to propose to Jamie, something much grander than Brean, Somerset.

'It was mind blowing when it happened. I sat down in the coffee shop and I made an excuse to leave and then before I knew it I was being stuffed into a batman costume and getting ready to propose.'

Ms Johnson still had no idea what was happening when a group of super heroes walked towards her

Eventually, when the super heroes parted, Batman appeared and went down onto one knee and produced a ring from his utility belt

Luckily Ms Johnson accepted the unusual proposal in front of almost 100 people

Ms Johnson, 22, met Mr Hill while dancing at theÂ  Brean Sands Holiday Park where they both work.

She said: 'I'm still in shock. It was really good but I still can't believe it happened.

'I had no idea what was planned. I thought I was going shopping with my birthday money. When the princess appeared in the cafe it still didn't even click that something was going on. I got very emotional when I realised. I started crying straight away.'

The happy couple are now planning to buy a house before getting married in 2016.

Michael Platt, Party Heroes owner and Mathew's best mate, said it was a magical event.

'Mathew is one of my best friends and he asked us to help him out with this idea and we said we'd make it happen.

'It was stressful because I wanted it to go right and be perfect for them but once it happened it was magical. The reaction of people watching was great, everyone was cheering.'
