Great-grandmother Valerie Pritchard, 72, drowned after she accidentally hit the accelerator instead of the brake while driving near Manchester Ship Canal

A great-grandmother drowned after she accidentally hit the accelerator instead of the brake and drove into a canal.

Valerie Pritchard, 72, was found trapped inside her car at the bottom of the Manchester Ship Canal in Warrington, Cheshire, after she 'lost control' of the vehicle in March.

Just days before the accident, Mrs Pritchard had spoken to her daughter about switching her manual car for an automatic as pressing down on the pedal was causing her back pain.

Her heartbroken family praised two men who ‘risked their own lives trying to save hers’ by jumping into the freezing water just moments after the fatal accident.

The grandmother-of-four, from Grappenhall, Warrington, Cheshire, died after she accidentally pressed the accelerator, causing the vehicle to shoot forward into the canal near to the junction of Egerton Street and Ellesmere Road in Stockton Heath, Warrington, on 12 March.

Alan Moore, assistant coroner for Cheshire, yesterday called her death an ‘unfortunate and tragic accident’.

Expert evidence at the inquest at Warrington Coroner's Court revealed that the car she was driving was in a serviceable condition.

The inquest heard that Mrs Pritchard, who had been driving for around 30 years, was fit for her age and had no medical history of seizures, fits or cramps to her legs, which could have caused her to faint at the wheel.

A post-mortem examination also revealed that there was no indication that she had suffered from a sudden heart problem while she was driving.

In the hours leading up to the fatal accident, Mrs Pritchard was described as being her ‘usual happy self’ and had bumped into a friend, Alison Addison, at around 3.45pm.

Mrs Addison recalled that she had made her laugh as she joked that she hoped her next physiotherapist would be a ‘hunky rugby player’.

But around 15 minutes later, Mrs Pritchard ‘lost control of her car’ while driving down Egerton Street and drove straight into the canal, where minutes later it was submerged under water.

 at around 5.30pm.

Attempts were made moments after the 
crash to save Mrs Pritchard, firstly by Antony Birchall and later by 
PC Simon Dadswell, who both waded into the freezing water to help.

Mr Moore said: 'It has to be noted that out of this heartbreaking tragedy is story of great bravery by the two men who tried to save someone’s life.'

Following the inquest, her daughters, Tracey Barrowman and Nicky Griffiths, said they would like to thank both men, adding that it was clear they were ‘risking their own lives to save hers’.

Her family also paid tribute to a much-loved woman, who will never be forgotten.

A statement said: 'She was always a happy person and she lived her life to the full and was always smiling. She had recently got engaged about 18 months ago and was making plans for the future.'
