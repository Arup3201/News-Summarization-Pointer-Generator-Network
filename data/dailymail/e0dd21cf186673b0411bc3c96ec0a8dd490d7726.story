Dozens of family members visited Nelson Mandela in hospital today as South Africa celebrates the former president's 95th birthday.

The iconic leader's grandchildren and former wife Winnie were all pictured arriving at Mediclinic Heart Hospital where he is being treated for a lung infection.

It came as doctors reported that Mandela was 'steadily improving' from the six-week illness which has left him in a critical condition.

The mood was one of celebration today as thousands of South Africans sang 'Happy Birthday' and took 
part in charitable initiatives in a global outpouring of support on U.N.-designated 'Nelson Mandela Day'.

Two of Mandela's 
granddaughters chose the eve of his birthday to launch a collection
of £20 T-shirts.

The T-shirts were emblazoned with 'Revolutionary', 'Long Walk to Freedom' and  'Legend'.

Swati Dlamini and Zaziwe Dlamini-Manaway posted a series of tweets inviting people to the launch in a shopping centre.

As reported by The Guardian, Swati said: 'We launched it around my grandfather's birthday to celebrate his legacy. My grandfather was also a lover of fashion. He became famous for his Madiba shirts.'

South Africa has been on edge since the former president was admitted to hospital on June 8 with recurring lung problems.

It is his fourth stay in hospital in
six months and has reminded South Africans that the man who is globally
admired as a moral beacon against injustice and a symbol of racial 
reconciliation will not be with them for ever.

U.N.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hailed Mandela as 'a giant of our times' today
and called on people around the world to pay tribute to him through 
community service.

Tributes: Mandela's birthday takes on extra poignancy this year following weeks of ill health

South Africans young and old commemorated the birthday with 67 minutes of public service to honour the 67 years Mandela served humanity by first fighting against white-minority rule and then consolidating racial harmony when he was president.

Many offered birthday wishes outside the Pretoria hospital where Mandela has been receiving treatment, singing songs and holding up signs wishing him a speedy recovery.

'Thank you for all that you have done for this country,' said one well-wisher, Margaret Chechie.

President Jacob Zuma visited Mandela at the hospital and said he was making steady progress. 'I was able to say "Happy Birthday" to him and he was able to smile,' he told reporters.

Hours earlier, his office had cited Mandela's doctors saying 'his health is steadily improving'.

Mandela's victory in the first multiracial elections in 1994 put an end to the apartheid system.

Four years earlier, he was released from 27 years spent in prison under white minority rule, 18 of them at the notorious Robben Island penal colony.

His former wife Winnie Madikizela-Mandela called the 95th birthday 'a gift to the nation'.

Across
South Africa, office workers, students, soldiers and ordinary citizens 
marked Mandela Day by sprucing up orphanages, painting walls at schools 
and delivering food to the poor.

Ethiopian
and Nigerian asylum seekers who had settled in South Africa fleeing 
persecution and conflict in their own countries cleaned streets in 
Johannesburg to pay tribute to a figure widely praised as 'a father of 
Africa'.

'In this country, Mandela is the 
reason all of us blacks are free, so that's why we love him as the first
citizen,' said Kennedy Uzondu, 30, a Nigerian trader who has lived in 
South Africa for three years.

The
United Nations declared July 18 as Nelson Mandela International Day in 
2009 and will celebrate with speeches from figures such as former U.S. 
President Bill Clinton.

The day will also be marked in nearly 20 U.S. cities with ceremonies around Capitol Hill in Washington and by volunteers handing out South African oranges in New York.

'Tata (our father) is making this 
remarkable progress and we look forward to having him back home soon,' 
Mandela's daughter Zindzi told reporters.

Zindzi
said the family planned to give Mandela a collage of family photographs
for a present and have lunch together at the hospital where their 
patriarch is being treated.

Despite the adulation on his birthday, Mandela's post-apartheid 'Rainbow Nation' has not fulfilled all expectations.

Enormous gaps still persist in 
income, employment and access to education and these inequalities 
largely follow racial lines, according to the government's own data.

White households in 2012 earn on average about six times more than black
households.

Nevertheless, quality education and employment opportunities have also been opened up to tens of thousands of blacks.

This has meant the 'Rainbow Nation' becoming a reality at integrated universities and in major city suburbs, where a new professional class of college-educated blacks has been moving into once almost exclusively-white neighbourhoods.

'The middle class is the incubator for a more tolerant and more integrated society.

'But that middle class is also very small compared to the working class and the underclass,' said Georgina Alexander, a researcher at the South African Institute of Race Relations.
