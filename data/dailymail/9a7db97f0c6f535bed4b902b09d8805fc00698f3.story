Assassination: Tunisian opposition politician and human rights activist Choukri Belaid was shot dead outside his home in Tunis today

Thousands of protesters took to the streets of Tunisia after an opposition politician was murdered yesterday.

Lawyer Shokri Belaid, who died in hospital after being shot four times outside his home in Tunis, was a leading member of the Popular Front party and a constant critic of the government.

As news of his murder spread, protesters gathered outside the interior ministry, many calling for the fall of the moderate Islamist-led government elected after an uprising drove out veteran ruler Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011.

There were angry demonstrations in several cities amid warnings of civil war in the country that launched the Arab Spring.

Talks on a cabinet reshuffle to include a wider range of parties in a coalition led by the Ennahda party have broken down.

Ennahda insisted it had nothing to do with the murder of Mr Belaid, 47, whose family said he had received regular death threats.

The killing, coupled with angry demonstrations in several cities, sparked warnings of a new wave of violence following reports Al Qaeda-linked militants have been accumulating weapons with the aim of creating an Islamic state.

Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali, who said the identity of the attacker was not known, condemned the killing of Mr Belaid as an ‘act of terrorism’ and a strike against the Arab Spring revolution.

Mr Belaid, who died in hospital after being hit by four bullets, was a lawyer and human rights activist who accused the Government of being a puppet of the rulers in Gulf Arab state of Qatar, which Tunisia denies.

Protesters also took to the streets 
in Sidi Bouzid, where jobless university graduate Mohamed Bouazizi set 
himself on fire in despair after police confiscated his unlicensed fruit
cart, triggering protests that toppled the president.

Police used tear gas to break-up the crowds and dozens were said to have been arrested.

Ennahda party president Rached 
Gannouhi immediately distanced it from the killing of one of their 
leading critics, insisting Ennahda had nothing to do with the shooting.

‘Ennahda is completely innocent of 
the assassination of Belaid ... Is it possible that the ruling party 
could carry out this assassination when it would (only) disrupt 
investment and tourism?’ he said.

He blamed those seeking to derail 
Tunisia’s democratic transition after the 2011 uprising, adding : 
‘Tunisia today is in the biggest political stalemate since the 
revolution. We should be quiet and not fall into a spiral of violence.

'We need of unity more than ever.’

Mr Belaid had been a fierce critic of
Ennahda, claiming that it turns a blind eye to violence perpetrated by 
extremists against other parties.

His family said he regularly received
death threats - the most recent on Tuesday - but had refused to limit 
his high-profile activities.

President Moncef Marzouki cut short a visit to France and cancelled a scheduled appearance at a summit in Egypt to return home.

He warned last month escalating tension may lead to ‘civil war’.

Tunisia was the first Arab country to
oust its leader and hold free elections as uprisings spread around the 
region two years ago, leading to the ousting of the rulers of Egypt, 
Yemen and Libya and the civil war in Syria.

Since the revolution, the government 
has faced a string of protests over economic hardship and Tunisia’s 
future path, with many complaining hardline Salafis were hijacking the 
revolution in a country dominated previously by a secular elite.

Declining trade with the crisis-hit 
euro zone has left Tunisians struggling to achieve the better living 
standards many had hoped for following Ben Ali’s departure.
