A 19-year-old suburban Denver woman who federal authorities say intended to wage jihad has pleaded guilty to trying to help the Islamic State militant group in Syria.

Shannon Conley pleaded guilty Wednesday in federal court in Denver to one count of conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization.

She wore a black and brown headscarf with her striped jail uniform.

She said nothing in federal court other than acknowledging that she understood the plea and its ramifications. She could face up to five years in federal prison and a $250,000 fine.

However, U.S. District Judge Raymond Moore ordered a psychological exam to be conducted before sentencing Conley.

The agreement says she must cooperate with the FBI and other law enforcement agencies and provide information about people in Colorado and elsewhere looking to help terrorists abroad. If she cooperates, prosecutors promised to ask a judge to reduce her sentence.

After the hearing, Conley's public defender, Robert Pepin, that she has been horrified by the atrocities committed by the Islamic State group and offered her condolences to those who have been caught up in its 'slaughter and oppression.' 

Those atrocities include the filmed beheading of journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff, who were hostages of the group.

'The fact that she was arrested may very well have saved her life,' he said of Conley, whom he referred to as Halima, the name she adopted after her conversion to Islam.

The certified nurses's aide was arrested at the Denver Airport in April, as she attempted to board a flight she hoped would get her to Syria.

She intended to meet up with a Tunisian ISIS fighter she met online who asked her to marry her and join the jihadist fight.

Authorities have said they are still investigating the suitor, identified in court documents only as Y.M. 

Documents say Conley told FBI agents that she wanted to use her skills as a nurse's aide to help the militants. She received military training by going to a camp run by the U.S. Army Explorers.

Agents repeatedly tried to discourage her.

Conley, who worried friends and family when she started wearing a head scarf and calling herself 'Halima', had raised suspicion with the FBI long before she tried to flee the country.

Prior to her arrest, she stalked Faith Bible Chapel in her hometown of Arvada, where she lived with her parents

Conley also allegedly stalked the Faith Bible Chapel, showing up at the church often to sketch the building. The senior pastor there turned her into authorities for her unusual behavior.

Conley started visiting the Faith Bible, just as they were planning to take a trip to the Holy land with a Jewish congregation, and would regularly visit the church to sketch the building.

Senor Pastor George Morrison eventually asked her to leave, and informed authorities about her behavior, but says he only thought Conley was a 'terrorist wannabe'.

Another student who knew her at Regis University says Conley tried out several different religions in a period of six months before finally settling on Islam.

During a visit to the Denver field office in August, FBI Director James Comey said stopping homegrown terrorists who radicalize through the Internet is a priority for the agency. He called Syria a safe haven and training ground for Westerners, who emerge with "the worst kind of relationships and the worst kind of training."

A Minnesota man recruited to fight for the Islamic State group was killed in Syria last month — five years after his high school friend died fighting for the terror group al-Shabab in Somalia.

It is unclear how Conley became interested in jihad, or holy war. After her arrest, authorities say they found CDs by U.S.-born radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki among her belongings.
