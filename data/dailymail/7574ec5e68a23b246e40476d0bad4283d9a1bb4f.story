One of the most tumultuous years in English cricket history ended with another batting collapse and an admission from Alastair Cook that he could have ‘no complaints’ if the selectors sack him as one-day captain.

England have lost yet another 50-over series – and they are losing their credibility. The sight of Cook standing his ground as he waited for the third umpire to confirm that Mahela Jayawardene had caught him cleanly at slip felt like a fitting coda to an often hapless tour.

It was the desperate act of a captain ill-suited to a form of the game in which England – whose 89-run defeat here condemned them to a 5-2 loss – are in danger of being cast adrift.

On Saturday, barring a late change of heart, the selectors will name Cook as their leader at next year’s World Cup. And if that is confirmed, the ECB will stand accused of sleep-walking their way to disaster.

Cook insisted he retained his appetite for the job, even if he has not been able to produce the runs or the results.

‘We’ll find out in a couple of days’ time whether I will be doing it,’ he said. ‘I think we can surprise people at the World Cup, but we’re going to have to play better than we have here.

‘No one’s got any divine right to play for England at all, and my performances this year in the one-day game haven’t been good enough. I can’t have any complaints if the decision went against me.

‘It’s tough when you lose games of cricket and don’t score runs. But I’m still hungry to do it. Whether the selectors still think I’m the right man, we’ll wait and see.’

The details of this fifth and final defeat of the series do not make happy reading. Sri Lanka racked up 302 for six, thanks to 101 from Tillakaratne Dilshan and a 26-ball 54 from Thisara Perera. Then, with the exception of the excellent Joe Root, England made a predictable meal of their chase.

Moeen Ali and Alex Hales fell early to aggressive shots, but Cook’s 32 in 49 deliveries made for painful watching. Almost lbw first ball, he was dropped at slip on one, and nearly bowled off an inside edge five runs later.

A slog-sweep for six off Dilruwan Perera was a punchy retort, but Cook then got away with an edge off seamer Suranga Lakmal that flew between keeper and slip. Soon, another edge off Lakmal was snaffled by Jayawardene.

Cook didn’t want to go. Of course he didn’t. But as he lingered, awaiting the inevitable judgement of Bruce Oxenford, he looked like the loneliest man in Colombo.

For all managing director Paul Downton’s talk of the progress England have made this year from the lowest of bases – and in the case of a few players he has a point – they have lost eight of the 11 bilateral series played either partially or completely in 2014. And that doesn’t include the World Twenty20, where they were humiliated by the Netherlands.

Only the 3-1 Test win over India can be looked back on with much pride. The rest has been middling to poor – and worse. This performance belonged in the last category.

England will reason that they are closer to knowing their World Cup team than they were when they arrived in Sri Lanka: Moeen Ali, James Taylor, Root and Chris Woakes have all enhanced their reputations.

But Eoin Morgan, out for four as he pre-meditated a sweep, is sinking fast, Jos Buttler looks tired, and Steven Finn had a quiet tour. Alex Hales has been messed around by the selectors.

For Ian Bell and Harry Gurney it may be time to say goodbye, though Ben Stokes is young and talented enough to qualify for an au revoir.

This, though, was no way to convince an increasingly sceptical English cricketing public that their team will have a prayer at the World Cup.

Sri Lanka, energised by a crowd who were cheering on the final one-day appearances on home soil of Jayawardene and his fellow legend Kumar Sangakkara, outplayed England in every department.

The pair even combined to take the last wicket: sentimentally thrown the ball by captain Angelo Mathews, Jayawardene had James Tredwell stumped by his old buddy.

These sides will meet again during the World Cup at Wellington, where Sri Lanka will hope to capitalise on an 8-4 winning record against England in one-dayers this year. You wouldn’t bet against them. As Cook said: ‘It’s been a hell of a year.’
