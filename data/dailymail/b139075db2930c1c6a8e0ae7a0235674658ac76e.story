Wayne Rooney went back to school this week as he prepares to fire England another step closer to Euro 2016.

The Manchester United striker visited his old primary school, Our Lady and St Swithin's in Liverpool, to the delight of the kids in the Class of 2014.

His visit was part of a Sportsmail exclusive to be revealed on Tuesday.

Rooney, 29, is preparing for a big week. The England captain is set to make his 100th appearance when they take on Slovenia at Wembley on Saturday evening and will be presented with a golden cap by legend Sir Bobby Charlton.

He will then lead England into battle against Auld Enemy Scotland at Celtic Park next Tuesday.

Rooney made his England debut as a fresh-faced 17-year-old against Australia in a 2003 friendly and has since played in three World Cups and two European Championships.

After goals against San Marino and Estonia during the last round of Euro qualifiers took him to 43 overall, Rooney will hope to move closer to Charlton's England scoring record of 49 in the upcoming double-header.

In an interview with Sportsmail's Jeff Powell this week, Charlton said he will be pleased when Rooney breaks his record.

'This is one of the oldest records in the game and I'm proud to have held it for so long,' Charlton said.

'But I'm happy that it's Wayne who will be the one to break it. Not just because he's one of ours at Manchester United. He's a personable lad and always respectful to me.'
