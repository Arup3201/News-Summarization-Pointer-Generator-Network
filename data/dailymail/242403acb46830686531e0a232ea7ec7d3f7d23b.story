A virtuoso violinist driven to suicide during the trial of a choirmaster who abused her has inspired a friend to sail the Atlantic and raise money to help a rape support charity.

Frances Andrade, 48, died from an overdose taken before she knew Michael Brewer and his ex-wife Kay, both 68, were convicted of six counts of indecent assault last February.

Graham Wyllie's daughter Emily, 15, was 
taught by the talented musician at a school in Bramley, Surrey, up until her death, and he has sailed from the Canary Islands to Saint Lucia in her memory.

Mrs Andrade's plight moved Britain when she killed herself during a trial where she was accused of inventing Brewer's abuse while she was at Chetham's School of Music in Manchester.

Much loved: Frances Andrade, 48, who was abused by a choirmaster, killed herself after she gave evidence against him. Graham Wyllie, right, sailed the Atlantic in her memory to raise money for a rape crisis charity

Following one emotional exchange, Mrs Andrade told the court: ‘This feels like rape all over again.’

Shameful: Michael Brewer's refusal to admit what he had done led to Frances having to face him in the court, which she said 'felt like rape again'

Her friend Graham Wyllie, 55, was inspired to join a crew on the 2013 Atlantic Rally for Cruisers, raising cash to help the Rape And Sexual Abuse Support Centre in Guildford.

'We became close through her teaching, and my daughter Emily became extremely close to her. They became great friends,' he said.

'Fran
 kept her ordeal all to herself. She had a effervescent personality and 
extremely outgoing. We had no idea about what had happened to her. There
 was nothing at that would give you the impression she had suffered.

'But
 in the year leading up to the trial she lost a lot of weight and had 
been into hospital. It is only afterwards that I realised she had 
attempted suicide.

'She was incredibly brave. When you stand up to
 a man like that, and an institution like that, you must feel like you 
have the whole world against you.

'This was very much in memory of Fran, and will hopefully help other victims of abuse. Sadly it is prevalent.

'There
 are a lot of vulnerable people out there who become victims. I hope 
this will bring some help and attention to their plight'.

Mr Wyllie has already raised £4,000 but hopes to raise even more cash for the 'inspirational' woman.

Tough: Graham and the rest of the crew crossed the ocean in 18 days, where the boat was battered by six metre waves and had its front sail ripped

Moved: Graham Wyllie said crossing the Atlantic (pictured) will hopefully do some good for those who have suffered sexual abuse or rape

Disgraced choirmaster Brewer, and his ex-wife Kay indecently assaulted former pupil Frances over a number of years.

The jury was not told about her death until they had returned their verdicts.

He was jailed for six years and his Mrs Brewer for 21 months.

Virtuoso: Mrs Andrade inspired young people in her music teaching but in her death has also encouraged abuse victims to speak out

Officers from Greater Manchester Police said since her death at least 30 other women have been 'spurred on' by her bravery and contacted them about alleged attacks at Chetham's and other institutions.

Mrs Andrade had also suffered abuse from the age of eight, she told the court, she was repeatedly raped by an uncle, her home life made worse by the death of her adoptive father, whom she dearly loved, at the age of 12.

The following year she won a place at Chetham’s, where she fell into the clutches of Brewer, a man with a predilection for his young, female pupils.

At the age of 18, his wife joined in the abuse, telling Frances that she ‘owed her’ as she indecently assaulted her. No doubt to dull the pain, the teenager drank and self-harmed.

But that picture of the tormented young Frances is not one her loved-ones find easy to match with the successful, ebullient woman she became.

However, the trial brought her pain back and she was unable to cope, but it is hoped she will inspire others to get help.

Graham Wyllie, whose boat was hit with six metre waves and its front sail ripped by force nine gales during the 18 day Atlantic crossing said it was worth it.

He said: 'It was an opportunity to reflect on how lucky we were to know Fran. She is an inspiration'.

Probe: More than 30 former female pupils of Chetham's School of Music (pictured) have reported abuse to police since Frances' death

Sonja Freebody, from the Rape and Sexual Abuse Support Centre (RASASC) Mr Wyllie is supporting said: 'Graham has been wonderful in raising funding for us.  It is very sad that the loss of Frances inspired him to raise funds for our centre, however we are really grateful and delighted with his efforts.

'One in four people will suffer rape or sexual abuse during their life time and it is still not openly discussed.  The majority of cases are not reported to the Police. 

'We as a country must eliminate embarrassment, talk openly and not tolerate rape and sexual abuse'.
