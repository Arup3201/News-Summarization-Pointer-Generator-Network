An Ohio businessman who sold fake urine and other products designed to help people pass drug tests pleaded guilty in front of a federal judge in Pennsylvania.

David Neal of Middletown began selling illegal substances online in 2006 with his company ACS Herbal Tea via websites like www.123zip.com and www.passthetest.com.

ACS Herbal Tea sold products like 'Magnum Unisex Synthetic Urine-Never Fail a Urine Drug Test'. 'Urine Luck', 'Eliminator Detox Carbo Drink' and 'Quick Flush Herbal Detox Pills'.

The 61-year-old Ohio man pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States in federal court in Pittsburgh yesterday

The 61-year-old man pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the United States and introduction of misbranded drugs into interstate commerce when he appeared before Chief United States District Judge Joy Flowers Conti in Pittsburgh yesterday. 

Neal faces up to six years in prison, a fine of $350,000, or both, when he returns for sentencing on May 13. 

The court was advised that Neal used ACS Herbal Tea to defraud the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) of the United States Department of Heath and Human Services.

He did this by 'obstructing and interfering with the lawful governmental functions of SAMHSA in overseeing, monitoring and establishing scientific and technical guidelines for federal workplace drug testing programs'.

Such tests are used to screen airline pilots, truck drivers and train engineers, as well as some federal employees such as FBI agents.

Court records indicate undercover agents bought some of the products in 2010 and 2012 as part of the investigation into Neal's company. 

Neal's attorney, Paul Laufman, told Judge Conti his client now realizes the products he was selling were 'not as harmless as he thought', the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review reported. 

A former US Airways Express pilot who pleaded guilty to similar charges in 2010, Stephen Sharp, was sentenced to nine months in federal prison.  

Neal was released on an unsecured $10,000 bond before sentencing.
