It was a nerve-wrecking night for Heisman Trophy winner Johnny 'Football' Manziel as he had a long wait to become the 22nd pick in the NFL draft .

Manziel was one of the most anticipated players to enter the draft which took place on Thursday amid much fanfare at Radio City Music Hall in New York. 

The former star quarterback at Texas A&M University sat with a sullen look on his
 face until the Cleveland Browns made its third trade of the round and grabbed the 
2012 Heisman Trophy winner at No. 22. To rousing cheers and chants of 
'Johnny, Johnny,' Manziel smiled widely as he walked onto the stage.

Commissioner Roger Goodell was subjected to some jeering as he officially opened the draft, which produces the primary pool of talent for NFL teams as well as plenty to cheer and boo for thousands of fans in attendance decked out in team jerseys.

The Houston Texans beefed up their defensive line by taking extraordinary pass rusher Jadeveon Clowney from the University of South Carolina with the first pick of the 2014 NFL draft.

Clowney was the first of 32 picks in the first round of the draft. Rounds two and three will be held on Friday with the last four rounds conducted on Saturday in the three-day extravaganza.

Rarely does a team not reveal the top 
overall choice until it is announced, and there was wide speculation the
 Texans had soured on the defensive end, whose junior season at South 
Carolina was accompanied by criticism he played it safe to stay healthy 
for the pros.

After Commissioner Roger Goodell 
announced the pick, fans filling Radio City Music Hall to capacity 
applauded Clowney as he held up his index finger, his eyes moist, a 
relieved look on his face.

Just like the 30 prospects on hand, the fans were extra eager to see who
 would wind up where after the draft was pushed back from late April 
because the theater was unavailable.

'It's been a long time. It just kicked in at the end there, man, I've been drafted,' Clowney said.

Clowney, 21, brings size, speed and power to a lineup that already has 2012 NFL Defensive Player of the Year J.J. Watt.

He is the first defensive player taken first overall since Houston selected another end, Mario Williams, in 2006.

Williams
 now is with Buffalo. Houston also made the top pick in its first 
season, 2002, taking quarterback David Carr. He never lived up to that 
billing; the Texans hope Clowney has more of an impact.

Tackle
 Greg Robinson, whose blocking helped high-powered Auburn make the 
national championship game last season, went second to St. Louis. The 
Rams owned the pick as the final payment for a 2012 trade with 
Washington that allowed the Redskins to draft quarterback Robert Griffin
 III.

Number one! South Carolina defensive end Jadeveon Clowney reacts after being chosen as the first pick in the first round of the 2014 NFL Draft in New York

St. Louis is concerned about the health of starting left tackle Jake Long, who is coming off knee surgery.

The
 first quarterback to go went to Jacksonville in the third slot, but it 
wasn't Johnny Football. Blake Bortles of Central Florida, whose stock 
shot up last season and in subsequent workouts.

At
 6-5, 232, Bortles drew comparisons to Ben Roethlisberger because of his
 combination of size and mobility. Jacksonville missed the last time it 
took a QB in the first round, Blaine Gabbert in 2011.

The
 Jaguars gave up on the inconsistent Gabbert, who struggled to read 
defenses and was benched for journeyman Chad Henne. Gabbert is now a 
backup in San Francisco.

'He's a down-to-earth guy, a self-made
 guy, a blue-collar guy and he wants to be the best he can be,' said 
Jaguars general manager Dave Caldwell, who added a word of caution: 'He 
just needs a little bit of time.'

Seeing
 a chance to grab playmaking receiver Sammy Watkins of Clemson, Buffalo 
swapped spots with Cleveland, also sending a first- and fourth-round 
selection next year to move up from ninth to fourth.

'Dynamic
 playmaker, and that's what this game is all about,' Bills GM Doug 
Whaley said of Watkins. 'He's automatically going to make our 
quarterback (EJ Manuel) better.'

Texas
 A&M tackle Jake Matthews, the son of Hall of Fame offensive lineman
 Bruce Matthews, went to Atlanta with the sixth overall pick. The 
Falcons leaked so badly on the offensive line in 2013 as they plummeted 
from NFC South champion to 4-12 that Matt Ryan was sacked 44 times.

Another Aggies star was chosen next, 
receiver Mike Evans to Tampa Bay. The 6-4, 231-pound Evans is durable, 
versatile - and quite emotional. He also couldn't hold back the tears 
when Goodell called his name.

The crowd thought Manziel might go eighth when Cleveland traded up one spot to get Minnesota's pick. So when the Browns took cornerback Justin Gilbert of Oklahoma State, there was a loud groan from the fans. Gilbert smiled wryly as he shook Goodell's hand.

Minnesota grabbed UCLA linebacker Anthony Barr, Detroit selected North Carolina's Eric Ebron, by far the best tight end in this crop, and Tennessee filled a need on the offensive line with Michigan tackle Taylor Lewan.

Finally, a local team was on the clock and the audience approved lustily when the Giants chose LSU receiver Odell Beckham Jr.

Beckham was followed by Pitt DT Aaron Donald to St. Louis, Virginia Tech CB Kyle Fuller to Chicago, Ohio State LB Ryan Shazier to Ohio State, Notre Dame G Zack Martin to Dallas, Alabama LB C.J. Mosley to Baltimore and, as fans chanted 'J-E-T-S,' Louisville safety Calvin Pryor is New York-bound.

Minnesota finished off the opening round by trading with Seattle to select Louisville's Teddy Bridgewater, the third quarterback taken. Bridgewater was an early entrant into the draft, but already had graduated.
