The former St. Louis County Police Chief has said he believes federal authorities are purposely leaking details of the Michael Brown case because they already know that no charges are going to be brought against Officer Darren Wilson.

Tim Fitch has claimed the controversial New York Times article published last week which details a frantic struggle between 18-year-old Brown and Wilson over his weapon inside a squad car is all part of a strategy to 'let people down slowly'.

The retired police chief says he believes federal authorities accept it is 'probably very unlikely' that the grand jury will recommend no charges be brought against 28-year-old Wilson and he expects to see more leaks like this in the next few weeks.

St. Louis County police chief Tim Fitch is now retired but he has claimed the federal authorities are trying to prepare the public for no charges being brought against Officer Darren Wilson for the shooting of unarmed Ferguson teenager, Michael Brown

'There was a struggle over the weapon. Law enforcement, we know that about half the officers killed every year with firearms are killed with their own,' said Fitch to CBS St. Louis.

'So the fact that he didn't have his own doesn't mean there wasn't a weapon there available that could be used in deadly force use.'

Addressing the New York Times article published last Friday, which included leaks from the grand jury which is taking place in secret, Fitch said he would call the sensational information phase two of the feds strategy.

In other words, 'to coordinate leaks to the media, and to start getting some of the facts out there to kind of let people down gently,' said Fitch to CBS St. Louis.

'When I say this is phase two – phase one was really Eric Holder's announcement how they were going to basically do a complete review and take over the Ferguson Police Department.'

Fitch said in his own opinion, physical evidence is preferable to eye-witness evidence.

'Physical evidence has no reason to lie. It doesn't see things differently,' he said to CBS St. Louis.

'If there was a struggle inside that car over a firearm, it sounds to me like Officer Wilson would have been justified in taking the action he did if he pulled the trigger and actually shot Michael Brown in the vehicle area.'

Taking the logic of a police officer to what he feels is the necessary conclusion, Fitch explained how he thinks the grand jury will see the most controversial part of the death of Michael Brown - his fatal shooting while holding his hands aloft in surrender outside of the car.

However, Fitch claims that if the grand jury leans towards what Wilson claims - that Brown was charging him when he opened fire - they will have no chance but to leave him uncharged.

'If Michael Brown was truly turned around and basically charging the officer, he already went for round one fighting over his handgun. Are you going to go for round two and take the chance of losing it this time?' Fitch said to CBS St. Louis.

Struggle: According to FBI analysis Brown's blood was found inside Officer Wilson's patrol car. the cop claims he wrestled with Brown in the car and was in fear of his life. But the account is disputed

'I think that would be a more logical explanation as to why Officer Wilson would have discharged his firearm at Michael Brown.'

Fitch then said that police officers have a lawful authority to apply force and they are under no obligation to retreat.

Indeed, Fitch said he fully expects to see more leaks ove the coming weeks.

According to those in Ferguson who have been in Ferguson during the protests and racial unrests following the shooting, they are concerned about the grand jury result now.

'If there is not an indictment, excuse my French, all hell is going to break loose,' one protester told CNN.

Benjamin Crump, the attorney for Brown's parents, told The Associated Press on Saturday that the officer's account of what happened was 'self-serving.'

'The officer is going to say whatever he has to say to try to justify killing an unarmed teenager,' Crump said. 'And certainly, his statement should not be taken above independent eye witnesses who are completely unbiased when he has every reason to be biased.'

Crump also said that because there were reports that Michael Brown was shot while he ran away, it 'doesn't matter' what happened in the car beforehand.

'He was definitely not in fear of threat when Michael Brown was running away from him,' Crump said.

Tensions: Police officers watch over the residents who have taken to the streets again, more than two months after the shooting

Memorial: Neighbors wait by a memorial set up on Canfield Street, Ferugson - the spot where Brown was killed

The Times reported that Wilson has told investigators that he was trying to leave his SUV when Brown pushed him back in and that once inside the vehicle the two began to fight. Wilson told authorities that Brown punched and scratched him repeatedly, leaving swelling on his face and cuts on his neck, the Times reported.

Wilson, who had been patrolling Ferguson for nearly three years, was placed on leave after the shooting. A state grand jury is considering charges against him.

Wilson is being represented by James P. Towey, general counsel for the Missouri Fraternal Order of Police and a former general counsel for the St. Louis Police Officers Association. Towey didn't immediately respond to an email Saturday seeking comment, and his work phone system wasn't accepting voicemail.

The Justice Department is investigating the Ferguson Police Department for possible civil rights violations, including whether officers there use excessive force and engage in discriminatory practices. Two-thirds of Ferguson's 21,000 residents are black but only three of its more than 50 police officers are black.

Brian Schellman, a spokesman for St. Louis County Police, which has taken control of Ferguson security, said in an email that the department doesn't comment on active investigations.
