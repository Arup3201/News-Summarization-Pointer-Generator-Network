Pick Jack Wilshere and Co for a dash at European U21 glory next summer 

Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain says he would welcome a place in the England Under 21 squad for next summer’s European Championship.

There has been much debate over whether full internationals such as Oxlade-Chamberlain, Arsenal team-mates Jack Wilshere and Calum Chambers, Manchester United’s Luke Shaw, Everton’s Ross Barkley and Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling should ‘drop down’ to Gareth Southgate’s team.

The Young Lions booked their place at the finals following a 4-2 aggregate victory over Croatia in a play-off this week and it immediately triggered talk of taking several senior stars to the Czech Republic in June.

Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is against players reverting to the Under 21s but Oxlade-Chamberlain insists he would not turn down a call-up.

‘Yes (I’d play at the Euros if I was asked), you’d never turn your nose up at something like that,’ said the 21-year-old, who has 18 England caps.

‘But there’s a lot that goes into that because the national team have two games around the same time as the tournament. So it’s up to Roy Hodgson to decide what he wants.

‘There’s a lot of players in the England squad at the moment that could drop back down and play for the Under 21s so it’s up to the manager to decide.

‘When that time comes around I’ll have to think about it. Gareth (Southgate, England U21 manager) might not even want me. It’s a discussion that will be had closer to the time with the England manager, someone at Arsenal and Gareth Southgate.’

And Oxlade-Chamberlain, speaking on the Clare Balding Show on BT Sport, added: ‘It’s a good thing that people aren’t being held back to play in the senior side if the manager thinks they’re ready. At the same time I do think we take our Under 21s seriously.’

Wenger, though, believes graduation to the senior ranks means a player should stay there.

‘Once a guy has moved up to the full national team, it's never good to move him down to the Under 21s,’ he said.
