A one-time NFL star has been sentenced to life in 
prison without the possibility of parole for murdering his lover's wealthy fiance nearly two decades ago.

Eric Andrew Naposki was sentenced on Friday by an Orange County Superior Court judge, a year after he was convicted of first-degree murder.

Prosecutors say 47-year-old Naposki shot 55-year-old William Francis McLaughlin 
at the suggestion of his lover, Nanette Ann Packard, who was engaged to McLaughlin, 17 years ago.

The pair allegedly conspired to carry out the murder-for-money slaying, so as to collect a $1 million life insurance payout.

Naposki was working as a nightclub bouncer at the time of the 1994 
murder. He was a former linebacker for the New England Patriots and 
Indianapolis Colts.

The love triangle case went cold with detectives unable to find enough evidence to back up their suspicions about the couple.

But police re-opened the investigation in 2007 and arrested Naposki and the former girlfriend, 46-year-old Nanette Johnson, three years ago.

Led away: Last year Eric Naposki was found guilty of gunning down William McLaughlin, his lover's millionaire boyfriend in December 1994

Prosecutors said the motive was money. Johnson, a mother-of-two, stood to gain $1 million in life insurance from McLaughlin's death.

She was also charged with murder and sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole.

The ex-football star was working as a bouncer at the Thunderbird Nightclub in Newport Beach at the time of the murder.

He was found guilty of entering Mr McLaughlin's house using a key allegedly provided by Johnson and shooting the 55-year-old businessman six times in the chest.

The victim's 24-year-old son ran downstairs to find his father's body, but the intruder had vanished.

Naposki claimed he was on his way to work after watching a soccer game involving one of Johnson's sons and didn't have time to carry out the shooting.

But investigators drove the route countless times and proved there was sufficient time for Naposki to have been the killer.

Naposki shook his head as the verdict was read out at Santa Ana Superior Court in July of last year but for McLaughlin's family the ruling signaled relief.

'We're very happy that justice has been served on our father's behalf,' said Jenny McLaughlin, the victim's daughter, following the conviction.

'My dad is honoured today,' added her sister, Kim, as she fought back tears.

Prosecutors said Johnson, now 46, had seduced the victim and convinced him to name her as a beneficiary in a $1 million life insurance policy taken out before the killing. He also changed his will allowing her to live in his beach house in the event of his death.

She was allegedly stealing thousands of dollars from his bank accounts in the months and weeks before his death.

The verdict came after more than three weeks of testimony that included 28 witnesses and more than 240 exhibits.
