A final challenge to the presidential decree denying Bali Nine ringleaders Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran clemency has failed.

Judge Hendro Puspito said the Administrative Court in Jakarta was not authorised to hear the challenge. 

'Clemency is the president's prerogative,' Judge Puspito said.

Todong Mulya Lubis, the pair's lawyer, said that their legal team would appeal the judge's decision

'It is the president's right to give pardon therefore clemency is not about technicalities,' The Age reported Judge Puspito as saying. 

The human rights lawyers informed the court that they intended to appeal the decision. 

Earlier on Tuesday, their lawyer, Todong Mulya Lubis, admitted they didn't have 'much chance' of succeeding with the appeal but  said: 'I hate not to try'. 

'I hate not to do it, because when we talk about human life, we have to do everything possible,' the human rights lawyer told ABC Radio. 

Lawyers for the pair argued that Indonesian President Joko Widodo did not follow due process when he denied the Bali Nine pair clemency. 

They claimed that President Joko did not consider their circumstances  because the pair were death row drug offenders.

The only other case ever deemed to be outside the realm of the court was brought against fellow Australian Schapelle Corby. 

It's a rare challenge, and the only one like it was brought by an anti-drugs group against the decision to grant clemency to another Australian drug smuggler, Schapelle Corby

When the same challenge was brought by an anti-drugs group against the decision to grant clemency to the convicted drug smuggler in 2012, the court ruled that it had no power to overturn presidential decrees. 

The 37-year-old is now free on parole. 

Authorities say it's 'very likely' the Bali Nine duo will this week be relocated to the island where Indonesia plans to execute them. 

Reports from the Indonesian government indicate that the duo will be transported via military planes to Nusakambangan penal island.

It has not been confirmed whether the government will use a Hercules plane which will mean a journey by both air and land for the pair, or the smaller airforce fighter jets which can land directly on the island. 

Four Air Force Sukhoi fighter jets were spotted at Bali's Denpasar International Airport.It is believed the jets will be used to transfer Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran to the prison island of Nusakambangan

Four jets from Denpasar airport have the capacity to land in the regency of Cilacap, where Nusakambangan is located, and would take an estimated three hours to fly the 900 kilometres from Bali to the island where the Australians are scheduled to be executed. 

If the Indonesian government made the decision to deploy a Hercules from Densapar, where the pair are being held, to Yokyakarta, the former capital in East Java, Chan and Sukumaran would then have a four-hour road journey to reach the Cilacap port to be ferried to Nusakambangan Island. 

Chan and Sukumaran were to be transferred from their Bali jail cells to the island last week, but it was found to have inadequate isolation cells.

Indonesian Attorney General HM Prasetyo on Monday said preparations were now 'about 80 per cent' complete.

Construction materials have been arriving on the island and a jail official has said there are orders to accelerate the works for completion within days.

The Indonesian Military has also made plans to secure the transfer of the men from Bali to central Java.

A squadron of Sukhoi jets has arrived at Bali's Ngurah Rai Airport, where air force commander Sugiharto Prapto said they were yet to receive orders related to the Bali Nine pair, but were there for seven days if needed.

If they use a charter plane, we're ready to secure it so that the operation can be implemented safely and smoothly, he said.

Indonesian news agency Antara reports Indonesian Military commander General Moeldoko has given orders for a Hercules aircraft to transport the men to Nusakambangan, guarded by the jets. 

Both Michael and Chintu spoke on behalf of their brothers who are awaiting execution at the prison

Chinthu Sukumaran told reporters that both Myuran and Andrew love Indonesia and the respect they have shown them during their 10 years in prison

'Don't try to disrupt the executions by any means. The military is prepared. Don't try to introduce a scenario that will disrupt the executions,' Gen Moeldoko reportedly said.

Meanwhile Mr Joko appears to be keen to let tensions with Australia over Chan and Sukumaran simmer down.

Asked about Prime Minister Tony Abbott drawing a link between tsunami aid to Indonesia and the death sentences on Monday, Mr Joko reportedly said: 'There's already been clarification. Don't you heat this up.'

Asked if it would affect plans to execute the convicted drug smugglers, Mr Joko said: 'No, that's our sovereign law', as quoted by Indonesian news website detik.com.

Tensions between Canberra and Jakarta boiled over last week after Jakarta perceived Mr Abbott's comments as threats and warned that 'no one responds well to threats'.
