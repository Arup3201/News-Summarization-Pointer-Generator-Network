A £1billion tidal lagoon off the coast of south Wales will form the centrepiece of ambitious renewable energy plans to be unveiled today.

George Osborne is set to use his Budget today to announce that the Government is beginning formal talks on funding the project to produce energy from turbines in Swansea Bay, south Wales.

The scheme would be over an area of more than four square miles cordoned off by a breakwater, with power generated as the tides pass through turbines when going in and out.

Construction: The project includes creating a six-mile sea reef, the reintroduction of the native oyster to Swansea Bay and an offshore visitor centre as well as national triathlon and water sports facilities

The Tidal Lagoon Power company will get the opportunity to discuss subsidies - which are expected to have to be about £150 per megawatt hour, reported The Guardian.

Controversially, this is far greater than the subsidy of up to £92.50 per MWh agreed for the planned Somerset nuclear plant Hinkley Point C - and triple the wholesale electricity prices of £50 per MWh. 

But the Department of Energy and Climate Change is said to have been reassured that if a prototype can be built in Wales, it will be possible to launch the concept more cheaply elsewhere.

The Swansea Bay scheme would need a six-mile sea wall up to 65ft high - although only half of this would be noticeable from land at low tide, according to Tidal Lagoon Power.

The wall would create a lagoon in the Severn Estuary with turbines that could harness the incoming and outgoing tides to generate power 14 hours a day.

The developers say the  project, along with four others, could meet 10 per cent of our electricity needs from the tides by 2023.

The six-mile wall around Swansea Bay complete with turbines could generate electricity 14 hours a day.

Tidal Lagoon Power believes the project will boost a UK supply chain and create a new export market if it gets the go-ahead.

The project includes creating a six-mile sea reef, the reintroduction of the native oyster to Swansea Bay and a visitor centre.

There are claims that it would save 236,000 tonnes of carbon a year, as well as create 1,850 construction jobs and 150 long-term jobs in its operation.

When plans were first submitted last year, it was claimed that the ground-breaking project could provide renewable power for 120,000 homes in Swansea for 120 years.

Developers behind the project believe it could be the first step in developing lagoon technology that could meet 10 per cent of the UK's electricity needs from the tides by 2023.

Tidal Lagoon Power said it hopes that 65 per cent of expenditure will be in the UK, boosting a home grown supply chain and creating a possible future export market.

The project includes creating a six-mile sea reef, the reintroduction of the native oyster to Swansea Bay and an offshore visitor centre as well as national triathlon and water sports facilities.

It is claimed that building more, larger lagoons would bring economies of scale. 

Other sites where lagoons are being considered, such as the Somerset coast, could have added benefits such as flood defences. 

Last month it was reported that the plan had been given a funding boost after investment management firm InfraRed Capital Partners agreed to provide £100million for the project.

But, also last month, consumer charity Citizens Advice said the project was ‘appalling value for money’ and should not receive subsidies.
