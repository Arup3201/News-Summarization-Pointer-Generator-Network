The number of stay-at-home fathers in Britain has reached a record high, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics.

There are now 229,000 men who stay at home with their children - up from 111,000 in 1993.

Meanwhile the number of women at home has fallen in the past year by 45,000 to 2.04million.

Over the same period there has been a five per cent increase in the number of fathers giving up work.

Adrienne Burgess, joint chief executive of the Fatherhood Institute, said: 'The number of women who earn as much or more than their partners is increasing, so it makes economic sense in some families for the father to be the primary carer.

'The public increasingly accepts that mothers can be employed and still be good mums - and that fathers can be good fathers without being the primary breadwinner.'

Nick Wilson, 45, who has four children, gave up his job as a primary school teacher in Hull.

'We decided one of us should stay at home and as I earned a bit less I decided to leave my job,' he said. 'We are worse off financially but it is worth it for the quality time I get to spend with my children.'
