An Indiana teenager who helped save two children after they fell into an icy reservoir in 2010 was killed on Sunday in a tragic shooting in an Indianapolis suburb at the hands of one of her own friends.

Aubrey Peters, 16, was pronounced dead at St. Vincent Hospital in Indianapolis late Sunday after suffering a gunshot wound to the chest inside Noblesville home, police said.

Noblesville Police Lt. Bruce Barnes said officers arrived at the home shortly before 11:30 p.m. after receiving a report of a person shot. He said they found Peters unresponsive.

Tragic: Aubrey Peters, 16, was allegedly shot dead by her friend at his family home on Sunday night after they were fooling around with handguns inside the house

Police questioned three other people who were inside the house and arrested Jacob Travis McDaniel, 20, on preliminary charges of reckless homicide and pointing a firearm.

McDaniel appeared in Hamilton County Superior Court today where a probably cause affidavit outlined how the 20-year-old was showing Peters a shotgun and handgun immediately before she was fatally shot.

One witness, Dajuan Williams, said that 'McDaniel tried to get Aubrey to hold the gun, but she didn't want to,' reported the Indianapolis Star.

It was at that point that McDaniel dropped the magazine from the handgun, pointed it directly at Peters, took the safety off and pulled the trigger.

Court documents from today said that McDaniel though the gun was not loaded, but instead a round was fired into Peters' chest.

'Aubrey clutched her chest and said, 'What just happened?' the affidavit says.

Panicked, McDaniel tried to concoct a story for the group.

'McDaniel then stated, 'The story is the gun fell off the table and went off,' according to the affidavit.

Medics arrived soon after the shooting and failed to revive Peters who was pronounced dead on arrival at St. Vincent's.

McDaniel's bond was set at $25,000. He will next appear in court on February 21 for a pretrial hearing.

Peters' grandfather, Randy, who has raised her since she was 8 months old, said the family is devastated.

'She had a 3.9 GPA. A great student, a great kid,' he said.

He said he doesn't know what happened and doesn't know McDaniel. He said his granddaughter left home Sunday to study.

The American Red Cross of Greater Indianapolis honored Peters in 2011 for helping to save two young girls who had fallen through the ice on Morse Reservoir the year before.

Peters, then a seventh-grader, told investigators she heard the screams of 7-year-old and 4-year-old sisters and alerted her grandparents and called 911.

One girl reached shore safely, but Peters' grandfather pulled the other out and resuscitated her.

Peters told WISH-TV at the time that seeing the girls struggle in the water was 'terrifying.'

'It was like watching someone die, and I hated it,' she said.

Red Cross spokeswoman Ann Gregson recalled honoring Peters Monday and lamented her death.

'She stood out â€” they always do when they're younger,' Gregson told WRTV. 'Any time there is a senseless death, it just breaks your heart.'
