Former IRA commander Martin McGuinness will  shake hands with the Queen next week.

Their meeting will mark a momentous and controversial step in the Northern Ireland peace process.

Mr McGuinness, Northern Ireland’s Deputy First Minister, is to meet the monarch at a jubilee event in Belfast on Wednesday, it was announced yesterday by Sinn Fein – the political wing of the IRA.

The handshake, which is due to take place behind closed doors, will be difficult for the Queen, who has lost members of her own family to republican violence.

Historic: It will be the first time in The Monarch's 60-year reign that she shakes hands with any former member of the IRA. Mr McGuinness was a commander in the terrorist group

Prince Philip’s much-loved uncle, 
Lord Mountbatten of Burma, was assassinated by an IRA bomb planted in 
his fishing boat in 1979.

The meeting will be hard for many 
republicans to stomach, because they see the Queen as the representative
of an occupying country. No Sinn Fein MPs sit in Parliament because 
they refuse to take an oath of allegiance to her.

Lord Tebbit, who was injured in the 
1984 Brighton bomb which left his wife Margaret in a wheelchair, said he
hoped the meeting showed that Sinn Fein was starting to ‘repent’.

Concerns: Sinn Fein president Gerry Adams said the decision would 'understandably cause difficulties for some republicans and nationalists'

He said: ‘I’m glad that Mr McGuinness
is moving to finally acknowledge that the Queen is sovereign over 
Northern Ireland and I hope it’s another step on his way towards 
confessing and repenting for the crimes of IRA/Sinn Fein.’

Martin McGuinness (pictured in the early 70s) has faced repeated 
questions over his IRA past which stretched back to the 1970s.

He joined the Provisional IRA as a teenager and quickly rose up the ranks.

By 1971, aged 21, he was second in command of the IRA in Derry.

He held that position at the time of Bloody Sunday, when 14 civil rights protesters were killed by British paratroopers in the city.

During the Saville Inquiry into the events of that day, Paddy Ward claimed McGuinness had personally handed him bomb parts, an allegation McGuinness claimed was 'fantasy'.

In 1973, he was convicted by Ireland's Special Criminal Court, after being caught with a car  loaded with explosives and ammunition. He refused to recognise the court, and was sentenced to six months imprisonment.

He has also been accused of attending the interrogation of British government informer Frank Hegarty, whom he allegedly encouraged to return to Derry where he was murdered. He has always denied those allegations.

However, he has never denied his role in the IRA, saying in September last year: ‘I didn’t say I never fired a gun – I was in the IRA. There were battles on the streets of Derry.'

However, when asked if he had killed anyone, he answered no.

He claims he left the Provisionals in 1974 to pursue a career in politics.

Tory backbencher Andrew Rosindell 
said: ‘It shows the kind of person the Queen is if she is willing to 
meet someone who has a horrendous past of engaging in and encouraging 
terrorism.

The Deputy First Minister was part of an organisation that murdered a member of her own family and many of her subjects.

‘Her visit to Ireland last year was a
truly historic occasion and this move by Sinn Fein shows that even the 
most republican people in Ireland are willing to move forward.

‘And by meeting her, McGuinness is accepting that the Queen is Queen of Northern Ireland.’ 
Sinn Fein leaders agreed to the meeting at a four-hour conference in Dublin of the party’s ruling council, the Ard Comhairle.

Party president Gerry Adams described
the decision as a ‘symbolic and significant step’ taken after 
consulting with grass roots support.

‘This will understandably cause 
difficulties for some republicans and nationalists,’ Mr Adams said. ‘But
it’s good for Ireland. It’s good for this process we’re trying to 
develop.

‘After Martin McGuinness completes this engagement he will be as true, as staunch, as active a republican as he ever was.’

Cross border charity Co-operation 
Ireland is to host an event for the Queen and Irish president Michael 
Higgins to celebrate the arts and culture across the island. This will 
provide the backdrop for the meeting with Mr McGuinness.

Mr McGuinness, the IRA’s second in 
command in Londonderry at the time of Bloody Sunday, was always the 
candidate to shake the Queen’s hand but delicate talks have been going 
on for months to arrange a suitable venue and occasion.

Sinn Fein boycotted the Queen’s 
successful state visit to the Republic of Ireland last year. But the 
Queen made a series of gestures which were seen as a dramatic advance in
Anglo-Irish relations – including speaking in Irish at a banquet in her
honour.

Sinn Fein was criticised for failing 
to be involved, but Mr McGuinness has since spoken of how he was struck 
by what the Queen did.

Last night, Liz Edwards, a victim of an IRA bomb attack in Warrington in 1993 said she was shocked by news of the meeting.

She said: ‘I still think of Martin McGuinness as a terrorist and that will never change. A leopard can’t change its spots.’
