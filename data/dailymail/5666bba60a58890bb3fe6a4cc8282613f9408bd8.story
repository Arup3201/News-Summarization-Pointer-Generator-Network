A British holidaymaker canoeing in the Amazonian rainforest was snatched at gunpoint by a gang of kidnappers.

Kathryn Cox was dragged away from the river and into the jungle where she was robbed.

The 28-year-old accountant was then abandoned in the middle of a remote nature reserve – teeming with alligators and anacondas – when her panicked kidnappers realised the military was closing in on them.

Yesterday, after an operation involving more than 100 soldiers, police 
and park rangers, Miss Cox and her fellow  hostage, Fiona Louise Wilde, 
were rescued close to the lawless Colombian border after a farmer heard
their cries for help.

They were said to be in ‘good condition’ last night despite their terrifying ordeal in the steamingly hot rainforest.

Their nightmare began on Friday afternoon as they travelled towards 
Ecuador’s Cuyabeno National Park with three other foreign tourists and 
two local guides.

The nature reserve – made up of rivers, lagoons and forest  covering 
2,000 square miles –  is home to more than 500 different species of 
birds, pink freshwater dolphins, 250 species of fish, including piranha,
and alligators.

The pair had booked the four to five-day expedition with a local tour 
company after arriving in the Tarapoa region of Sucumbios province, in 
the north-east of Ecuador.

The kidnappers – whom locals say have links to a notorious Colombian 
drug-running gang – robbed the tourists of their cameras and phones 
before taking Miss Cox, from Limpsfield in Surrey, and  Australian Miss 
Wilde, 32, at gunpoint and escaping into the forest.

The women were 
abandoned later that evening after their kidnappers realised they were 
being tracked.

The traumatised pair were then forced to spent the night alone before their cries for help were heard by a passing farmer.

A source said that the women were also being tracked by the  military 
after one kidnapper used a mobile phone, allowing his whereabouts to be 
traced.

The Foreign Office advises  against visiting the area because of the 
risk of organised crime. It  also warns that ‘express kidnappings’ – 
where victims are held for a short time as criminals empty their bank 
accounts using their bank cards – are common along the Ecuador-Colombia 
border.

There have reportedly been more than 100 kidnappings in the area over 
the past year and the border is notorious for drugs barons.

Katga Saubert, 43, who owns a tour company called Magic River in the 
same area as the kidnapping, said: ‘It is happening all over  Ecuador 
and not just here. It is because of the social problems and the poverty.
Perhaps there should be better security.’

Locals were also quick to blame a criminal gang called the Black Eagles,
which is made up of ex-paramilitaries.

Miss Cox’s parents, optometrist 
Neil, who owns his own practice, and radiographer Averin, said they were
too upset to speak.

However, her brother Andy, has told neighbours: 
‘She is doing well. She is okay.’

Neighbours say that Miss Cox decided to go travelling in South America after breaking up with her long-term, live-in boyfriend.

She left her job as a senior assessment manager with NHS watchdog 
Monitor and visited Brazil, before arriving in Ecuador this month.

Last night Jose Serrano, Ecuador’s interior minister, said the women 
were ‘in good condition’ and had been flown to a hospital in the capital
Quito to be examined. His department posted a photograph of the pair on
Twitter last night, dressed in army fatigues.

Relations between the UK and Ecuador have been strained in recent months
by the country’s decision to grant asylum to WikiLeaks founder Julian 
Assange.

The 41-year-old, who is currently holed up in London’s Ecuadorian 
Embassy, is wanted by Swedish police for questioning in relation  to 
rape and sexual assault allegations. He denies the claims.

A Foreign Office spokesman said: ‘We are pleased it has been confirmed that the two women missing in Ecuador have been found.’
