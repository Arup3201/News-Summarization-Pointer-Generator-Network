Albert Thorn, 80, is still in shock after being attacked during a road rage incident in Cambridge 

A terrified pensioner was beaten with a claw hammer in a road rage attack because he had overtaken a young driver.

Albert Thorn, 80, said he is still in shock after the motorist started following him when he passed him at a two-lane junction in Cambridge.

Mr Thorn said the man, who was driving a van, pulled in front of his car, forcing him to stop suddenly.

He then leapt out and brandished a claw hammer, before screaming and shouting profanities at Mr Thorn.

The angry motorist then aimed for Mr Thorn with the weapon, attempting to bring down the hammer on his head in a series of violent blows. 

The father-of-three, said: 'I have terrible injuries and am still in shock about this.

'I just can't believe what happened and that someone would attack an old man for nothing. I was absolutely terrified.'

Luckily, Mr Thorn managed to defend himself by holding up his arms.

But he was hit on the arms, hands and legs, where he was left with extensive bruising. 

He added: 'He went for my head, but I shielded myself with my hands. If he had got my head it could have have been much worse.'

The van driver had become irate after both motorists tried to turn right at the same junction.

Mr Thorn was behind as the pair took the corner at different angles.

The young man then began shouting at Mr Thorn out of his window to 'turn at a junction properly', before slamming on his brakes in front of him.

Mr. Thorn - who has been driving since he was 21 and has never had an accident - then overtook him and the van driver chased after him and forced him to stop. 

Mr Thorn, a retired builder, had to be treated at the scene by paramedics, but he did not want to go to hospital. 

He is now urging members of the public to come forward with any information.

He said: 'I feel like he needs to be caught, I don't like to think what he could be capable of.' 

Police are now appealing for information about the incident, which took place along Arbury Road. 

A spokesman said: 'This was a particularly nasty attack on a vulnerable pensioner.'

The suspect is described as white, in his mid-20s with short brown hair.
