Mr Padilla had run began the La Playita taco shop 17 years ago.

He was closing the shop for the night with members of his family when three men with guns entered.

Miriam Padilla’s husband and brother-in-law were at the restaurant and said Jose Padilla grabbed his .38-caliber pistol in an effort to protect the family.

'He was like me; we don’t go down without a fight,' Miriam Padilla told KTLA.

The father of six and grandfather of 11 was shot around 10 times in the chest.

'I would always tell him, just let them take the money,' she said. 'Who cares? The money can be replaced. Your life can’t.'

'He was the rock of this place,' she said through tears. 'It meant so much to him, it meant everything to him. Everything. He had this place and his family. It meant to the world to that man.'

'He died in the place that he most loved. He started 15 years ago with just $5,000 in his pocket, him and my mother' she said. 'They worked really hard for this.'

Padilla's family is offering a reward of their own money for information on who killed him just after Father's Day.

Investigators are now reviewing surveillance video from the restaurant for additional clues.
