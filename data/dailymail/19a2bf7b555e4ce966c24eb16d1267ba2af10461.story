A soldier has revealed how he left behind Ugly Betty and came home to Cinderella after seeing his wife's dramatic weight loss. 

Tracey Desmond, from Abingdon, Oxfordshire, wanted to surprise her husband Jason when he returned from a tour of the Falkland Islands this month. 

The 35-year-old dropped three stone in just two months - going from a size 22 to a svelte size 12/14 and kept her impressive 38lb weight loss a secret from her partner of four years.

Tracey said she was determined to beat the bulge before Jason - a Corporal in the Royal Logistics Corp - returned home and lose the weight with hypnosis.

She said she was so committed to keeping her changing figure under wraps she would even make sure Jason couldn't see her when the pair would video chat while Jay was serving abroad with the army.

She said: 'I decided after Christmas that I needed to do something - it was getting ridiculous. The weight just seemed to creep up on me and I couldn't believe that I was a size 20.

'I wanted to keep the whole surprise factor and do a big reveal so I would make sure Jay couldn't see me when we Skyped.

'I was just googling weight loss and Easy Loss came up - I had heard of people doing hypnosis to stop smoking so I thought I would give it a go.

'I started at the beginning of January and the weight just seemed to drop off - I've lost 38 pounds in just two months.

'I even went out and bought a new dress, in a size 12, and got dressed up for the occasion.

'And when Jay walked through the door and saw me there was this look of shock on his face.'

Jason, 42, said: 'It was a massive shock - I felt like I had left behind Ugly Betty and came home to Cinderella.

Before the weight loss: Tracey had started to pile on the pounds after she became seriously ill with polycystic ovaries and comfort-ate to get over having to undergo a full hysterectomy

'Nothing Tracey has tried before has ever really worked so I was shocked that this worked so well. And it was lovely to see her in a dress for a change.

'I have had to learn to feed myself too as she only eats when she's hungry - so it has probably done me some good too.

'When I get back from tour I have promised her I am going to take her shopping and treat her to some new clothes for our holiday.'

The HR and Training Coordinator can now fit her whole body in one leg of her former size 22 trousers

Tracey started to pile on the pounds after she became seriously ill with polycystic ovaries and comfort ate to get over having to undergo a full hysterectomy.

But the determined HR and Training Coordinator has now set herself the task of shedding the final two stone by the time Jay's tour comes to an end in 10 weeks time.

And she is spurred on by a luxury holiday the pair have booked to the Dominican Republic - with her final goal being to flaunt her new bikini body in a size 12 tankini.

The ultimate goal is for Tracey to wear a size 12 tankini on the beach on holiday in the Dominican Republic

Tracey said: 'We always book a holiday for when Jason is off so that we have something to look forward to.

'My goal now is to be able to wear a tankini on the beach - that's what I am pushing towards. And I don't want all the women looking at him while we are away.

'I feel such a huge difference in myself since I started Easy Loss and it is just so easy. It's not a diet and I can still eat whatever I want, whenever I want - but I just eat when I'm hungry.

'It's a way of life and I can't ever see myself going back to how I was before now. I have learned how to listen to my body, and only eat when I am hungry.'

Tracey's incredible weight loss story received 900 likes on the hypnosis app's Facebook support group

Sue Peckham, co-founder of the Easy Loss Virtual Gastric Band - Lose Weight Fast App, said: 'Tracey is an absolute inspiration. She has been brilliant and followed the instructions of the app to the letter. She has really done so well.

'And it is such a lovely story that she did it to surprise her husband, it brought a tear to my eye when I spoke to them and he said that he was so shocked when he came home and saw her. They are such a sweet couple.

'Her story got an incredible 900 likes from our Easyloss Facebook Support Group members-one of the biggest responses we've ever had.'
