This is the heart stopping moment a toddler appears to dangle from the fifth floor balcony of a high rise building in Brazil – while his mother was reportedly asleep inside.

Crowds screamed 50ft below as the boy, thought to be about three years old, appeared to cling to the ledge of an apartment block in Vila Velha, a town on the country’s east coast.

It was later claimed that the child’s mother was asleep inside at the time, oblivious to her son’s plight.

One man positioned himself under the balcony as rescuers dashed to the youngster’s aid.

A waiter working opposite told Brazilian website Midia Con News that customers were ‘crying at the sight’ before he ran out to help.

It is thought the child may have clambered on to the ledge by climbing on to a chair on the balcony.

Eventually he was rescued by Bruno Teixeira who told Midia Con News that the boy’s mother was asleep in the apartment the whole time.

Mr Teixeira said: 'When we saw the boy hanging we ran without looking.

'When we arrived at the apartment the room door was open and the balcony was closed. (The boy's) mother was asleep. She should be more responsible with her son's life.'

Despite his ordeal, the youngster was said to have escaped injury. A police investigation is now underway following the drama on Saturday.
