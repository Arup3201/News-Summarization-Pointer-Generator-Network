Beaten: The woman teacher was knocked out in the attack and magistrates say she nay even give up the profession for good (picture posed by model)

A schoolboy who punched a woman teacher unconscious in a ‘sustained’ classroom assault must pay just £100 compensation.

The 15-year-old was spared a custodial sentence after he admitted throwing a textbook at her, then punching her repeatedly in the face.

When she fell to the floor, he continued punching her and she lost consciousness.

The teacher suffered a cut and bruising to her head, loosened teeth and a swollen face which required hospital treatment.

Magistrates said she 'may not continue teaching'.

The boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was given a six-month referral order to work with the youth offending team by magistrates at Burnley Youth Court in Lancashire yesterday.

The school and the teacher can also not be named.

The child said the attack came after he was subjected to a long period of verbal bullying by other students.

He punched the teacher after she saw one of her teaching assistants was 'having problems' getting him to do a task during lesson time.

When the teacher told the boy to 
complete the tasks, he swore at her and threw a textbook at her. She 
asked him to leave the room because of his behaviour.

At this point the boy walked up to the 
teacher and punched her on the left eye with his right fist, then again 
on the side of her face.

She was punched 'two or three' times as she lost consciousness.

Two teaching assistants and a number of 
other pupils witnessed the incident, which took place at around 1.30pm 
on November 6 at a school in Burnley.

The boy was arrested later that day and has since been expelled from the school.

He admitted the section 47 assault in an interview with police and blamed his behaviour on the bullying he had been subjected to.

The boy’s defence team said he had 
admitted responsibility from the outset and that he knew his actions 
were wrong, and he was on the waiting list for psychological help.

 'You have brought shame on your family.

You have put this teacher in fear and she may not continue teaching.

I hope you can turn your life around.'

They also explained how the boy’s father had been to visit the teacher and her family to apologise on his son’s behalf.

In sentencing, the magistrates said 
they had taken into account that the attack was ‘out of character’ and 
told him to ‘start afresh’.

They
 said: 'This was a particularly nasty and sustained assault. You knew it
 was wrong and that the way you went about dealing with your problems 
was not right.

'I hope this
 is the last we see of you in court. It has been very upsetting for your
 parents and has brought shame on your family. Let’s start afresh.

'You have put this teacher in fear and she may not continue teaching.

'I hope you can turn your life around.'

The boy’s father must pay £100 compensation plus a £15 victim surcharge.
