A Florida nurse is suing Cesar Millan after she was viciously attacked by a pit bull that had left the Dog Whisperer's training center just six days before.

Alison Bitney was visiting a friend in California in September 2014 when the dog named Gus--which had a documented history of aggressive behavior--savagely bit her left arm, which has left her hand with no feeling or function.

Bitney filed suit in California against her friend John Vazzoler, the Dog Psychology Center in Santa Clarita, Millan and a rescuer who'd previously saved the dog from being euthanized following an attack in Katy, Texas in February 2013.

Sued: Florida nurse Alison Bitney is suing Cesar Milan after a pit bull (not the one pictured) that was trained at his California Dog Psychology center savagely attacked her in September

According to the suit, the dog inflicted 'disfiguring open wounds, deep muscle and tendon lacerations' on Bitney, who's now seeking punitive damages, reports the LA Times.

The dog had previously been sentenced to die by a Texas judge in February 2014 after he attacked a trainer named Amber Rickles. The canine was in her care after its owner surrendered him for being 'nervous, growling and doesn't like children,' according to Bitney's suit.

'With the pit bull still attached to her left breast, Ms. Rickles backed into a laundry room where the dog released his grip, enabling Ms. Rickles to close the door. The pit bull then broke through the door and attacked Ms. Rickles a third time, latching onto her left arm and breaking it in two places,' reads the suit as obtained by Courthouse News.

Despite the horrific nature of the attack and the grueling surgeries and rehabilitation the suit says Rickles had to endure, Gus was rescued by the woman who'd originally brought him to Rickles, Jennifer L. Romano.

Bitney says Romano appealed to the judge, who allowed Gus to live so long as Milan's Dog Psychology Center then agreed to take the pit bull and rehabilitate it at Millan's center, according to the 27-page lawsuit.

The Dog Whisperer, as he's known, did not have contact with the animal in question, his lawyers say. However, Bitney's suit claims his facility released the dog, which had a history of attacking people and other dogs, while knowing it was a danger

'Thereafter, Cesar Millan and his Dog Psychology Center, agreed to take over custody and control of the pit bull and not to release it until it was "fully deemed a safe member of society,"' reads complaint.

However, Rickles claims the dog owner fell behind in payments to the center and was 'entrusted it to someone with no training or experience' on September 17, according to the suit.

Days later, Bitney was attacked.

However, the Dog Psychology Center tells the LA Times that Gus left the facility 'against the strong advice and objection of his trainer.'

What's more, Cesar Millan, who is named in the suit, was never in contact with the animal, they say.

Bitney is suing for an unknown sum. A call to her attorneys at Scolinos, Sheldon & Nevell was not immediately returned.
