The Australian thrill seeker has been traveling the world to get his next big hit.

But it appears the 27-year-old kayaker has left quite an impression internationally with his recent clip, which features him taking a wild ride down Tasmania's extreme rivers - taking 'yellow' water rafting to a whole new level, as it appeared on a global extreme sports website.

From the footage on Epic TV, it's clear that Mr Kiernan is completely in his element as he paddles through the rough waters of Leven Canyon, Butlers Gorge, Harding Falls and St Pauls.

The Tasmanian-native, who began kayaking in 2003, has also been frequently posting clips of his kayaking adventures on video-sharing website Vimeo.

And it's no secret that the Aussie, who also works for Franklin River Rafting, is a passionate extreme sport enthusiast.

'Hearing the world roar and tremble around you. That's my addiction, an addiction that takes me around the world and has grasped me like any drug addict would grasp their next hit, but in this world, the other addicts don't want to quit and nor do I,' he wrote on his Vimeo page.

The Aussie admitted that he's addicted to the extreme sport, which has prompted him to travel the world to seek other wondrous locations

'Kayaking for me used to be all about the big air and scary drops but that has changed over time after some life changing events on the river.

'To stay true to kayaking I had to find a way to keep paddling new and changing constantly. This meant loosing some of the focus on going as big as possible all the time, pushing myself to explore the many wondrous locations that are accessible to paddlers only.

'I got into film the very same year I began traveling with my kayak. It was a way of documenting the corners of the globe I had been lucky enough to explore with my closest friends.'

The Aussie also works for Franklin River Rafting - based in Tasmania
