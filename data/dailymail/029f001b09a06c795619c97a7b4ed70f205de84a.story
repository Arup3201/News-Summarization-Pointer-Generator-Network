Plans: Iain Duncan Smith, Work and Pensions Secretary, believes a new 'right-to-own' scheme would attract more 'C2 voters' from the skilled working classes, providing a timely election boost

Millions of working families would be given the chance to own their own homes in radical Conservative plans to extend Margaret Thatcher’s flagship housing policy.

The right-to-buy would be extended to up to 2.5million housing association tenants – transforming the lives of many.

Some could even be rewarded for holding down a job for a year or more by simply being handed a stake in their properties.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith is understood to be pushing both ideas – designed to echo Lady Thatcher’s defining right-to-buy policy for council house tenants – for inclusion in the Tory election manifesto. 

A senior Government source said this was being ‘seriously considered’. Introduced in 1980, the right-to-buy led to more than 1.5million homes being sold off at discounted rates.

Mr Duncan Smith believes that a new ‘right-to-own’ would attract more ‘C2 voters’ – the skilled working classes who helped to deliver Lady Thatcher’s three election victories.

As well as promoting home ownership and rewarding work, he argues that the scheme would reduce the vast housing benefit bill.

Currently, taxpayers subsidise the housing costs of many unemployed and lower-paid workers who live in housing association properties.

Housing associations are non-profit making private bodies that provide low-cost social housing. Regulated by the state, they receive public funding.

Right-to-buy rules allow most council tenants to buy their homes at a discount, but the rules do not apply to housing associations.

They only qualify for limited discounts and can only buy a property that has been acquired by an association since 1997. Discounts vary between areas, but range from £9,000 to £16,000. Council house tenants, by contrast, can get discounts of up to £77,000 across England and £102,700 in London.

The Centre for Social Justice, the think tank set up by Mr Duncan Smith in opposition, has suggested housing association tenants should be offered discounts of up to 30 per cent of a property’s value.

Former Tory leadership contender David Davis and former Labour welfare minister Frank Field have also backed new rights for tenants to buy their homes.

Still more radical would be rewarding those with the best employment records with free stakes in their homes. Mr Duncan Smith is understood to want to consider the idea for those in work for a year or more.

The association would retain a 40 per cent stake, ensuring taxpayers gain from an increase in house prices, while the owners would have the remaining 60 per cent. 

Money raised when the property was sold would be ploughed back into more social housebuilding, which would be spread out rather than concentrated on estates.

Flagship policy: Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher introduced the 'right-to-buy' scheme in 1980, which led to more than 1.5million homes being sold off at discounted rates

The move is being supported by the Conservatives’ election campaign chief Lynton Crosby, according to Government sources. Some in Downing Street are said to be cautious about Mr Duncan Smith’s proposals. 

There are fears that handing people in social housing a stake in their homes might anger voters renting in the private sector, with little hope of affording to buy. However, the Government has already launched its Help to Buy scheme, which offers first-time buyers support in getting on to the property ladder.

Kate Davies, chief executive of Notting Hill Housing, said: ‘It would be important to ensure that housing associations were able to replenish housing stock.’

A Tory spokesman said: ‘We will set out our manifesto policies at the appropriate time. No decisions have been taken.’

Enabling housing association tenants to buy their homes would be likely to require major changes to the 1996 Housing Act so that associations are forced to sell at the discounts set by government.

The Coalition has already increased right-to-buy discounts for council homes, meaning more are moving into the private sector.

But housing associations, which date back to the 19th century, have gradually replaced councils as the main providers of social housing. They are autonomous, not-for-profit bodies backed by public money and loans from the private sector.

David Orr of the National Housing Federation, which represents Britain’s non-profit housing associations, said: ‘We fully support the aspiration of homeownership, but not at the expense of the 1.7million people currently waiting for desperately needed social housing.

‘Selling off homes at a price that leaves very little to replace them does not make sense.’

He said the suggestion that housing association tenants might own their homes after a year of work was ‘so preposterous, it cannot be considered a serious solution to our housing crisis’.
