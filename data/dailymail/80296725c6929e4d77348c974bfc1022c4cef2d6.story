The son of an Ohio police officer who vanished nine years ago has been found dead in a car pulled from a pond this week.

The coroner's office in Franklin County confirmed the body found in the submerged car was that of Anthony 'Tony' Luzio Jr., Delaware County sheriff's spokeswoman Tracy Whited said.

The 25-year-old Luzio disappeared on July 4, 2005, after leaving an Independence Day party.

Found: The dead body of Anthony Luzio Jr. was discovered in a car pulled from a pond nine years after he went missing from a Fourth of July party

The pond: Investigators used geographic-information-systems technology to search for bodies of water that back in 2005 would have had no obstacles like trees or fences around them like this Ohio pond 

The discovery: Search Crews discover Anthony Luzio Jr.'s body nine years after he disappeared 

Closure: Anthony Luzio Jr.'s family has some closure now that their son's remains and his car were found submerged beneath the waters of an Ohio pond 

Luzio was the son of retired Columbus Police Sgt Anthony Luzio Sr.

His family's years of hoping, waiting and wondering ended Tuesday, when the car he'd driven was pulled from the central Ohio pond.

Luzio's father told The Columbus Dispatch the discovery was bittersweet.

He said the family always had a bit of hope of finding Luzio but now can put him to rest.

'After 9 1/2 years to prepare for this, we thought we would be ready for the inevitable.

But it hurts as bad as if it happened yesterday,' said Anthony Luzio Sr., a retired Columbus police sergeant.

The pond was searched after police officers identified bodies of water big enough for a car to go into around where Luzio Jr. was last seen.

A search company that relies largely on donations found the car using a small boat equipped with sonar.

It located the car within minutes of launching the boat

A fire department diver then went into the water to confirm it was Luzio's car.

The Clothing matched what Luzio was seen last wearing and his driver's license was inside the car.

Members of the dive team sent their condolences to the Luzio family and told WCMH-TV in Columbus they hoped the discovery of the car and Luzio's body would bring some closure.

The car was towed to the sheriff's office to be examined.

Long search: Investigators searched twelve ponds using the sonar-equipped boat before they found the car at around 4:30 p.m. in the thirteenth body of water 

Team effort: Several agencies  used geographic-information-systems technology to search for bodies of water that back in 2005 would have had no obstacles like trees or fences around them

Desperately searched: Anthony J. Luzio Jr.'s family's years of hoping, waiting and wondering ended Tuesday, when the car he'd driven was pulled from the central Ohio pond

Mystery: How Anthony J. Luzio Jr. ended up in the pond remains a mystery and police say they aren't jumping to speculate nine years after his tragic disappearance 

The Columbus Dispatch reports that investigators from numerous agencies searched long and hard for the missing Luzio and enlisted the help of both the sheriff's office and the Powell Police Department to search through the county's 1,000 bodies of water.

Dennis and Tammy Watters who own Team Watters Sonar Search and Recovery in Moro, Illinois travelled to Delaware County eight times over the past year to help search for Luzio and in that time became close to Luzio's parents Carla and Anthony Sr.

The heartbroken parents along with the Watterses looked for ponds that could hide a car and be driven into from a road.

They used geographic-information-systems technology to search for bodies of water that back in 2005 would have had no obstacles like trees or fences around them.

'We believe he drove off the roadway for whatever reason,' Capt. Kevin Savage of the sheriff's office said.

Close family: Anthony J. Luzio Jr.  was the son of retired Columbus Police Sgt Anthony Luzio Sr. with whom he had a strong family bond 

'When you never have a person or a vehicle show up, in our mind, that vehicle has to be hidden somewhere.'

In the spring of this year, investigators searched 300 bodies of water all within a 3-mile radius of the home where Luzio was last spotted.

'We were prepared to search every pond in Delaware County,' Savage said.

They looked at water near Old State Road because a friend of Luzio's lived nearby.

They searched twelve ponds using the Watterses' sonar-eqipped boat before they found the car at around 4:30 p.m.

'We always knew it was a solvable case,' Mr. Watters told the Dispatch.

Even though they found Luzio body and his car, Investigators said they aren't trying to speculate about what happened on the night that he went missing.

The investigation spanned for 9 1/2 years and Martin Watters says there's no rush to figure out what happened.

'It would be premature and presumptuous on my part to speculate what happened that night,' the sheriff said. 

Devastated: Anthony J. Luzio Jr.'s parents are happy their son was found but they said that discovering him dead only gives so much closure as though it 'feels as though it happened yesterday'
