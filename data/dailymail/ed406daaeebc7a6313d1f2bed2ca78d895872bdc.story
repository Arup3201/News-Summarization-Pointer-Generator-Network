Not the job in hand: The Missile Defence Agency workers should have been developing rockets like this SM-3 rather than looking at pornography

The Pentagon has ordered staff at its top-secret missile defence unit to stop watching porn and concentrate on the job in hand.

Military chiefs are furious that workers at the Missile Defence Agency have been wasting valuable hours surfing the web for smut rather than developing state-of-the-art weaponry.

The violation came to light after fears were raised that viruses may have already been smuggled into the department's mainframe through x-rated sites.

An internal probe then found that some staff had been downloading adult material on office computers and sharing them with each other via the internal network.

It constitutes a massive security risk to one of America's most secretive agencies because porn sites provide perfect cover for criminals and foreign spies to sneak snooping software past even the most sophisticated of firewalls.

In a bid to curb the abuse, the agency's executive director sent a stern memo warning staff that 'appropriate disciplinary action' would be dished out to anyone caught surfing the net for smut.

'There have been instances of employees and
contractors accessing websites, or transmitting messages,
containing pornographic or sexually explicit images,' John James Jr
wrote in the July 27 memo leaked to Bloomberg News.

'These actions are not only 
unprofessional, they reflect time taken away from designated duties, are
in clear violation of federal and DoD and regulations, consume network 
resources and can compromise the security of the network though the 
introduction of malware or malicious code, he wrote.'

He added that anyone caught misusing 
the agency's network will face losing their security clearance and could be 
suspended, even fired.

Security breach: The Pentagon's defence chiefs are understood to have been furious upon hearing that some staff members had accessed websites 'known to have had virus and malware issues'

Agency spokesman Rick Lehner told Bloomberg that the
memo was written after 'a few people' downloaded
material 'from some websites that were known to have had virus
and malware issues'.

One government cybersecurity expert, who wished to remain anonymous, said criminal gangs and foreign intelligence agencies, such as Russia, embed spyware deep within the coding of pornographic websites in a bid to access and harvest confidential data from governments and corporations.

Such sites contain high-quality images and videos that contain complex computer coding - the ideal place to hide viruses.

The Missile Defense Agency is responsible for developing,
fielding and upgrading the nation’s ground- and sea-based
missile defense programs.

It works closely with countries including Japan and Israel as well as companies such as Boeing Co. and Lockheed Martin Corp.

In July last year, America vowed to retaliate with military 
force against countries that sabotage its  computers in the 
Pentagon’s first ever strategy on how to fight  escalating cyber 
attacks.

Anxious to contend
with growing internet incursions linked to Russia and China, U.S. 
military chiefs reportedly agreed that the most serious sabotage 
attempts should constitute an act of war.

The
document was designed to tackle a changing 
world in which computer hackers could cripple America’s financial 
markets or public transport systems.
