Patrizia Gucci pictured during her trial: She has been released from jail on parole after agreeing to take a part-time job in Milan fashion house Bozart

The former wife of fashion heir Maurizio Gucci, jailed for ordering his murder, has been released after agreeing to parole - two years after she rejected an offer because it would mean getting a job.

Patrizia Gucci, 64, hired a hitman to gun down her multi-millionaire ex-husband Maurizio after a maintenance dispute following an acrimonious divorce.

She was jailed for 29 years in 1998, later reduced to 26 years on appeal, and in 2011 she was given the chance of parole after having served half her sentence.

But she told the board looking into her case: 'No thanks as it would mean getting a job and I have never worked a day in my life.'

Now the so-called Black Widow has apparently changed her mind and taken up a part-time job at the Milan fashion house Bozart, where she will remain for the next three years until her sentence is complete, after she had time taken off for good behaviour.

Judge Roberta Cossia agreed to her release after Gucci's lawyer Danilo Boungiorno presented a request and also added that she was willing to be taken into the care of social services while working as a style consultant at Bozart.

Mr Boungiorno said his client had offered to work at the showroom after she contacted them from her cell at Milan's San Vittore prison.

It is a complete reversal from 2011 when she said 'I would prefer to stay in my cell and water my plants,' adding she wanted to stay inside because she wanted to take care of her pet ferret.

Gucci's initial decision was not entirely a surprise to those that know her.

She once famously summed up her lavish luxury lifestyle, which included apartments in Milan and St Moritz, by saying: 'I'd rather cry in a Rolls then by happy on a bicycle.'

Gucci who has two daughters Allegra, 31, and Alessandra, 38, had previously been allowed out on day release to visit them and her elderly mother at the Milan flat where the family lived when her husband was still alive.

Her original trial heard how she ordered the murder of her husband in 1995, after he offered her $650,000 in a divorce settlement.

She rejected the settlement, describing it as a 'plate of lentils' and insisting she wanted at least $1million.

When Mr Gucci refused she hired hitman Benedetto Ceraulo, who shot him four times as he arrived at his office on March 27, 1995.

Plot: Maurizio Gucci, pictured left in 1994, was shot four times by hitman Benedetto Ceraulo, shown right in the defendants cage at his trial in 1998,Â  as he arrived for work at his office in central Milan on March 27, 1995

Gucci was found guilty of ordering 46-year-old Mr Gucci's death after her clairvoyant and confidante Pina Auriemma turned informer and told police about the plot.

The trial, where it emerged that the defendant was furious after she discovered her husband had dumped her for a younger woman, captivated not only Italians but the world.

Gucci - who arrived in court in designer outfits every day - told the judge and jury of how she had been betrayed by Ms Auriemma, saying: 'Never let even a friendly wolf into the chicken coop. Sooner or later it will get hungry.'

Nine years ago her legal team tried to get the conviction overturned on the grounds of her ill health, claiming she had been affected by a brain tumour, but the case fizzled out.

Reversal: Gucci had previously rejected offers of parole because she would be compelled to take a job, saying 'I would prefer to stay in my cell and water my plants,' and take care of her pet ferret

Bozart's owner Alessandra Brunero said: 'We were very surprised when she contacted us and asked about working for us but we are more than happy to help. She can advise us on window displays and supplies.'

The Gucci family was one of Italy's richest and most well known 'dynasty families' and their saga has even been turned into a TV series.

Six years ago there were plans for a film about the family with Angelina Jolie in the lead role but the project never took off.

Maurizio Gucci was the grandson of Guccio Gucci, founder of the fashion company made famous with its double G logo.

In the early Nineties the label was hit by problems and he sold it for $120million to a Middle Eastern investment group just two years before his death.
