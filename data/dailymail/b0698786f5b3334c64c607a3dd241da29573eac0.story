Ten thousand starlings fluttered above electricity pylons in the Scottish borders yesterday evening as the endangered birds begin to flock together for winter.

The swarm of endangered creatures flapped around the site in Rigg near Gretna, Dumfriesshire, for around 20 minutes before taking off into the night.

Photographer Owen Humphreys captured their frantic flight, having waited weeks for the birds to appear in a flock as big.

A flock of around ten thousand noisy starlings fluttered above electricity pylons yesterday in Rigg, Dumfriesshire in the Scottish Borders

Owen Humphreys was on hand to capture the birds as they flew in formation, creating weird and wonderful shapes in the dusk sky

The photographer said those who were lucky enough to witness the spectacle could 'see in them what they like' as the birds dipped and dived into a variety of shapes

'The shapes they formed were spectacular, making a gorilla, two dolphins and maybe even a giant bird,' he said.

'People can see in them what they like. There was also a real bird of prey, probably a buzzard, which seemed to make the starlings fly even more.

'As well as the visual sight, the noise of them flying was remarkable.'

He added: 'I’ve been going to the site for three weeks to get the right photo. Last night made it all worth it.'

Chris Collett, a spokesman for the RSPB, said: 'There are several theories as to why starlings gather in this way.

'Some say it’s for fun, or for communication, but the most likely reason is for survival, the theory being that the sheer number of birds will confuse a bird of prey.'

The weight of the flock on electricity wires caused minor power cuts in the rural village near Gretna which has a population of around 2,000.

Though the starling remains one of the birds most commonly seen in gardens, its decline elsewhere is of concern to the RSPB, the country's largest nature conservation charity

It is not known exactly why the creatures swarm in such large numbers though many tend to migrate to the UK from harsher climates in search of milder winter conditions

A larger bird of prey was seen flying among the smaller creatures whose flight is quick and direct, but which also run speedily along the ground

The birds are considered a high priority by the country's largest nature conservation charity who describes them as 'small and gregarious.'

Though they remain some of the most commonly seen garden birds, their presence elsewhere is of concern. Starlings typically migrate to the UK in winter in search of a mild climate.

They are rarely seen in the Scottish highlands, but appear in large flocks throughout the rest of the UK.

It is thought there are around 1.5million of the birds left in the UK, though exact figures are not known.

The
largest rootsts are found in plantations, reed beds and city centres 
across Britain though more are to be found in southern England.

The creatures which feed on fruit and insects appear to have black feathers from a distance, but a closer look will reveal glossy shades of green and purple
