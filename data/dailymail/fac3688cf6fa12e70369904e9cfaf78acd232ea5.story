When you’re at the wrong end of the table training ground fights become big news.

They happen regularly at every club but when you’re struggling, you can guarantee snippets of a bust-up will get out.

I lost count of the number I saw over the years. Some of them lingered, and grudges have started as a result and the players concerned never get over it. Most of them were forgotten in an instant and accepted as part of the game. You shake hands, move on.

Doesn't look good: Swansea City dispensed with manager Michael Laudrup on Tuesday after a poor run

Change of tune: Nobody had a problem with Laudrup's relaxed training methods when Swansea were winning

Usually they blow up from a bad challenge in a game but the game is less physical now and consequently there are fewer heavy tackles flying in during training sessions as the game now has an emphasis on interceptions.

Little flare-ups and arguments, even when team-mates are playing on the same side, happen all the time at all levels of the game. I have played in a few media games now and seen some classic head throws. In that lovely stadium in Gdynia, I lost it myself with RTE’s Tony O’Donoghue when he failed to pass. Again.

So it’s amusing, even now I’m in the media, that training ground bust-ups always seem to fascinate the press, and the public of course.

Let's be friends: New interim manager Garry Monk makes up with Chico Flores after a previous disagreement

Happier times: Monk and Flores celebrate winning the Capital One Cup under Laudrup in 2013

Before he was brutally axed by Swansea City this week, Michael Laudrup had to deal with a training ground bust-up between Chico Flores and Garry Monk, who has now interestingly been appointed interim manager. I wish him all the best.

Laudrup made the point that nothing came out of Manchester United on their way to the title last season, but as they’ve had their struggles in David Moyes’ first season, stories have come out of the training ground.

Invariably, these scrapes are nothing but when they become an issue the manager has to be seen to deal with it. Otherwise the suggestion is that he has lost control of the training ground.

Fired up: West Ham convincingly beat Swansea in Laudrup's last match in charge of the South Walians

It has been a tougher second season for Swansea and there were rumours that Laudrup was going to leave at the end of the season. Perhaps that influenced the board’s decision with their team now just two points above the relegation zone and struggling to hurt teams and score goals. They want to appoint a long-term successor now and halt the alarming slide.

But the way the club have got rid of Laudrup has really surprised me. His relaxed style of management, not being on the training ground every day, was not a problem when Swansea were winning. I doubt he has managed the club any differently from day one. But it is scrutinised and criticised when you’re not winning.

Split: Swansea chairman Huw Jenkins (left) was the man responsible for telling Laudrup his was sacked

The supporters’ trust has a 20 per cent stake in the club and a say in how it is run. So they do consult with chairman Huw Jenkins, who was the one to inform Laudrup he was sacked. But in doing so they have totally severed the ties with a manager who guided Swansea to a Capital One Cup win less than a year ago and took them back into Europe. He was being linked with the Real Madrid job in the summer.

Last season I saw Swansea quite a few times and for the first six months they were brilliant and good to watch.

Under Brendan Rodgers there was a lot of possession and passing football but they posed more of a threat under Laudrup, especially with the addition of Michu, who was arguably the signing of last season. He was certainly the best value for money.

Missed: Swansea have struggled without the regular goal supply of injured striker Michu (centre)

It has not helped Swansea that Michu has been missing for so much of this season and quite often, when he has played, he has not been fully fit.

Michu scored 22 goals in all competitions after his move from Spain but this season he has scored just four and played in 15 games. He has been a big miss and his return couldn’t have come at a better time.

They have had to rely on another new signing in Wilfried Bony for their goals and he has scored seven in the Barclays Premier League, most when Swansea have been out of games. He has only scored one when they’ve won, and that was a penalty.

On target: Wilfried Bony has performed well in Michu's absence, but Swansea have still laboured

Strikers will tell you that goals are goals, and they all count. I was no Alan Shearer, but I prefer to see them scoring when they really matter, particularly when a team is struggling. 

The dressing room door slammed shut. I had my eyes to the floor. I knew what was coming. And I knew I was getting it.

It may have only been a reserves game we’d just lost but it was Derby County v Nottingham Forest. It was still a derby. And Nigel Clough did not want to lose it. But he did lose it with me, and rightly so.

Fiery temper: Then Derby boss Nigel Clough criticised me heavily in front of team-mates when I played for the Rams

It was a close game, heading for a score draw and we were injury-time. I was playing at centre-back, brought a ball down near the edge of our area, and flicked it across to my central defensive partner. I didn’t hit it hard enough, a nippy teenage striker sneaked in and scored the winner.

He opened the tirade with a few choices in rapid succession. ‘You’re the most experienced player out there,’ he shouted. ‘You still just boot it in the stands.’ And so it went on for a good few minutes. Every word, every insult was justified.

Around me were young lads just starting out. I was old enough to be a couple of their dads but that didn’t bother Nigel. It was no different to a rollicking I’d have got 20 years ago.

Play the right way: Clough would always encourage his midfielders to enjoy the game and to pass it around

No doubt like his father, Nigel can be hard and he can cut players down with one comment. I liked his management style, the way he worked and the things he said to me.

He wants his team to play in what I would deem the right manner, and to go out and express themselves. Whenever I played in his four man midfield, he always told us to go out and enjoy ourselves and don’t hold back. He got that into the players every day and would stop a session if a player was holding back and not doing things naturally.

Fulham were awful on Tuesday, there’s no getting away from that. But Sheffield United thoroughly deserved their victory, their second at a Premier League ground after beating Aston Villa in the third round.

Of course the priority is wins in their League One relegation battle. David Weir was sacked after 10 games because Sheffield United were in the bottom four. Like Coventry City and Wolves in this division, Sheffield United and the supporters believe they should be in the Championship, at least.Thumbs-up

Jose Mourinho 

Villain to hero in a week. His tactical masterclass at the Etihad has thrown the title race wide open. And was nearly as good as Big Sam’s at Stamford Bridge. All right, it was one of the best we’ve seen. But did we really expect anything else? 

Masterclass: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho reminded everyone of his tactical genius against Man City

Thumbs-down

Aberdeen ‘supporters’

It is disgusting that Neil Lennon cannot go to a football match in peace. The people responsible for spitting and throwing coins at the Celtic manager have no place in football grounds.
