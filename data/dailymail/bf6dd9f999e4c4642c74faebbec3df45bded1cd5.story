As her two-year-old daughter Darcey covers her hands in paint then shrieks with delight, Trish Gregory looks on with amusement.

Her once tidy and ordered home in Newark, Nottinghamshire, has descended into a permanent state of noisy chaos, since Darcey and her baby sister, Bea, came along.

But Trish, 49, wouldn’t have it any other way.

In fact, she loves being a mum so much so that she and her partner Rob, 46, are even hoping to start trying for another child next year.

By then, Trish, a social worker, will be 50, but she says her age doesn’t put her off.

‘Both my pregnancies were easy and I have plenty of energy, so why not?’ she said.

Trish conceived Darcey and then Bea through egg donation at CARE Fertility Nottingham.

She believed that using the eggs of a younger woman would give her a better chance of getting pregnant.

The clinic used Rob’s sperm, so he is biologically the girls’ father.

But Trish has never felt like any less of a mother because of the way the girls came into the world.

Trish, pictured after giving birth to Darcey in 2012, said she left having children late in life as she hadn't met anyone she wanted to become a parent with

She said: ‘I carried them for nine months and gave birth to them and so they couldn’t feel more like mine.

‘And funnily enough, Darcey is blonde like me, whereas Rob is dark. She also has many of my mannerisms.

‘If I have a bad day with them both I just joke that they’re nothing to do with me,’ she laughs.

Like so many other women her age, Trish resents the endless talk about women putting their careers before family and then leaving motherhood too late.

‘This certainly wasn’t the case for me as I always wanted children,’ she said.

‘I love my job but it isn’t the reason why I’m having kids now.’

She points out that she only got together with Rob, a horticulturist, when she was 40, and up until then she had not met anyone that she actually wanted to have children with.

The couple met on a bouncy castle at a friend’s barbecue and they hit it off straightaway.

‘We’re both very laidback and Rob is very funny and kind,’ Trish said. ‘I knew he was the one for me.’

After a couple of years together, they started trying for a baby but when nothing had happened after a year or two, they began to talk about IVF.

‘We certainly didn’t rush into anything, and we aren’t really the types to panic,’ she said.

‘We both loved our jobs, we had a good social life and a great relationship so I think we realised that if we didn’t have a family it wouldn’t be the end of the world.’

But when the clinic suggested egg donation, they both agreed to give it a go - and they eventually settled on a college-educated, blonde-haired donor.

Unfortunately, only one embryo was viable from the eight donor eggs. Remarkably, though, Trish still got pregnant, and she and Rob were delighted.

In spite of her age, she sailed through the pregnancy, giving birth to Darcey only a couple of hours after finishing work.

Trish jokes that she spent her entire maternity leave simply staring at her daughter.

‘I was just mesmerised by her and I didn’t really care about anything else,’ she said.

And to her surprise, Trish seemed to be a lot more relaxed than many of the other new mums around her.

According to the mother-of-two, some of the women she met in their 20s were worried about getting things wrong, and were fixated on having all the best equipment for their babies – while Trish and Rob had bought everything second-hand.

‘They worried if their baby had a sniffle or hadn’t put on much weight,’ Trish said.

‘I guess being older, I was just more used to trusting my instincts more, and having a bit more perspective on things.’

But it was, says Trish, the mums in their 30s who seemed the most anxious.

‘Many just wanted everything to be perfect,’ she said. ‘Perfect houses, perfect babies and perfect careers, whereas I just wanted to enjoy my baby, without worrying about what anyone else thought.’

Other mothers would often comment on how calm Trish was, and because she looks young for her age, she says she has never had a problem meeting other mums at playgroups or in the park.

She and Rob loved being parents so much so that when Darcey was one, they returned to the clinic to start the egg donation process again.

Unfortunately their original donor was no longer available, so they chose another one – and this time they were left with two viable embryos.

One became Bea and the other they have frozen for the future.

‘We’re hoping to go back to the clinic again soon, and it would be great if we could have a third,’ said Trish, who is back at work full-time, having found the girls a child-minder.

‘We are fatalistic though. If it happens, it happens, but if it doesn’t, we have two wonderful girls, and we certainly feel very blessed.

‘One thing is for sure though. I’m certainly not going to waste my time wishing I’d had children when I was younger.

‘This works for us. We’re all happy and healthy and I don’t think I’d have been quite this relaxed if I’d embarked on motherhood any earlier.’
