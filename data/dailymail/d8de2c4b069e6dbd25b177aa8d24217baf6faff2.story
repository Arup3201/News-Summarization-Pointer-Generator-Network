A mysterious hacker called 'pyknic' launched a cyber assault on NBC websites and a Lady 
Gaga fan site last night in 'celebration' of Bonfire Night.

For several hours, websites promoting NBC shows such as Saturday Night Live, Jay Leno and Jimmy Fallon displayed messages such as 'Remember, remember the fifth of November - the gunpowder treason and plot.'

The attacks are thought to be linked to 
the cyber-attack group Anonymous, which often uses a Guy Fawkes mask from
the film V for Vendetta as an emblem.

On November 5th each year, the UK celebrates 'Guy Fawkes Night', where town set off fireworks and burn effigies of the conspirator who tried to blow up the Houses of Parliament in 1605.

Hacked: NBC websites were replaced with crude messages by hacker 'pyknic' on Sunday

In 1605, Guy Fawkes led a party of conspirators into the cellars of the House of Lords, and stowed 36 barrels of gunpowder.

They planned to ignite the barrels when the unpopular James I and his political elite were assembled in the chamber, and Fawkes hoped to install a Catholic monarch back to the throne.

When authorities learned of the plot, on November 1, they appointed Thomas Knevitt to investigate - and he allowed the plot to continue, so that he and his
men could catch the conspirators in the act.

He discovered Fawkes hiding in the cellars in the early hours of November 5, and the conspirator was tortured until he confessed - and then he was promptly executed.

Every year since, effigies of Fawkes are burned across the UK.

Users trying to visit the 'Shows' or 'Full Episodes' 
tabs on the NBC main site were instead directed to a black page with glowing lights, blasting music, and 
references to Guy Fawkes Night.

It appeared that the defacement of 
the affected sub-sites was cleaned up in a couple of hours, with NBC and
its various websites functioning normally again by late Sunday evening.

However, older versions maintained by
search engines such as Google and Bing still bore the message 'hacked 
by pyknic', referring either to an individual or a group.

This was followed with a warning that 'user info' and 'passwords' had been exposed by the culprit.

The message "Remember, remember the 
fifth of November" suggested a link to Anonymous, a movement of cyber 
rebels which has appropriated much of the symbolism around today's Guy 
Fawkes Day.

Anonymous later denied responsibility for the NCBC and Lady Gaga hacks - but said they had hacked the sites of banking company PayPal, security software maker Symantec and Imageshack.

The Anonymous team say they have the account details and passwords of 28,000 PayPal users, but the firm says it has no evidence of a software breach, and the websites all appear to be working normally.

Googled: Searching for 'GAGA Daily' still shows the 'hacked' caption

The holiday is meant to mark the failed plot to blow up the country's parliament in 1605.

However, conclusively determining responsibility for such attacks can be nearly impossible.

Also defaced by 'pyknic' was a Lady 
Gaga fan site, Gaga Daily, an act which drew a sympathetic message from 
the pop star on Twitter.

"My little angels! help is on the 
way," the message read, adding that "haus of gaga techies will be on it 
... to the rescue. calling them now."

The site was soon restored.

Anonymous and its offshoot Lulz 
Security have been linked to a number of high-profile computer attacks 
and crimes, including many that were meant to embarrass governments, 
federal agencies and corporate giants.

A spokesman for NBC Universal declined to comment.
