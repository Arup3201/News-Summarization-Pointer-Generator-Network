Offered an improbable second chance in the Champions League, Celtic are on the verge of taking it. A composed, tactically astute performance against the champions of Slovenia in the Ljudski Vrt Stadium leaves Ronny Deila's team 90 minutes from the group stages for a third successive year.

Short of signing David Blaine it's hard to recall a greater act of naked escapology than this. The Scottish champions are not through yet. Neither should they expect a good luck postcard from Warsaw in the coming days.

Yet, on a night when they dominated a very ordinary Maribor team for long spells they could – should – have emerged with a first leg victory.

Such was the contrast with the 4-1 defeat to Legia which left Deila's team staring down the barrel of fiscal gun, however, there were few of a mind to quibble on Wednesday night.

There were some similarities with the Legia game. Once again Celtic made a terrific start. Once again, they conceded a quick equaliser. But this time there was no collapse. Celtic have good reason to believe they will finish the job at Parkhead before a large crowd now.

For the third successive away game in Europe Callum McGregor, the 20-year-old who spent last season on loan at Notts County, scored an invaluable goal. Like Stefan Johansen, Craig Gordon and a raft of others in Celtic colours he had a fine game and is making a habit of it, showing excellent composure and decision making in key areas.

It took him eight minutes to score the goal which ultimately proved crucial to Celtic in Warsaw. Here it took just five.

Johansen, who had an industrious night in Celtic's midfield, sprung the Maribor back line with a lofted pass to an onside and in space Jo Inge Berget.

The Norwegian had work to do yet. He rode the first challenge then steered an angled shot towards goal. Home keeper Jasmin Handanovic blocked with his legs, but McGregor is showing a pleasing habit of being the right man in the right place.

The youngster slotted the ball into the net for 1-0. The gnashing of teeth on the streets of Warsaw was almost audible above the silence of the home supporters.

There was no sign of panic from Celtic. The possession stats were overwhelming in their favour. Maribor generously stood off the team in green and white and allowed them to play.

Yet cold hard experience has already shown this season that nothing is simple for Scotland's champions.

After shipping a leveller in three minutes in Poland they lasted a whole eight here. Yet the goal they lost – once again – was pitiful.

Ronny Deila started 19-year-old on loan Manchester City defender Jason Denayer beside Virgil van Dijk and threw Beram Kayal in beside Charlie Mulgrew as a second holding midfielder. Last season's top scorer Kris Commons was sacrificed to make Celtic stiffer and sterner in defence and that decision was justified by a return to form from Kayal. The Israeli was solid here.

Yet in 14 minutes the home team simply passed the ball through a porous backline. Denayer's inexperience showed as he was caught wrong side of his man, while Mikael Lustig might also have done better.

Whoever cops the blame eventually, left winger Damjan Bohar slotted the through ball calmly past Craig Gordon for 1-1. It was Maribor's first chance. Virtually their first attack.

It was natural, then, to fear for Celtic. There was a déjà vu to much of this. Mercifully, it was misplaced.

In contrast with warsaw Deila's team didn't panic. They made it to half-time at 1-1 quite comfortably and were desperately unlucky not to be 2-1 – maybe even 3-1 ahead.

Oddly willing to stand off and allow their visitors to play, Maribor conceded a raft of first half corners.

One of them, in 20 minutes, almost ended in a goal when Stefan Johansen's deep, probing effort to the back post was headed back across goal by captain Charlie Mulgrew. Zeljko Filopovic headed off the line.

There was an astonishing let-off for Maribor just after the half hour mark. Another Celtic corner, this time from Anthony Stokes on the other side picked out Virgil van Dijk in front of goal and his header could hardly have been any better. It was bulleting into the net until, freakishly, it struck Celtic teammate Johansen on the goalline and stayed out.

Still there was no reason for Celtic to despair. They passed the ball sharply, UEFA statistics showing the Scots had 64% possession in the first half. With a striker able to hold the ball up and bring others into the play

And yet the worry here was clear. Celtic had shown they could score. Could they defend?

Maribor stung the palms of Craig Gordon twice with long-range efforts. A Petar Stojanovic piledriver was pushed wide by Gordon as van Dijk stood off.

The former Scotland keeper, making his first European start for Celtic, was called into action again after Maribor's creative danger man, Agim Ibrahimi made space to thump a 25 yard left foot drive at goal. Gordon pushed it out and Dare Vrsic failed to bring the ball down to guide the rebound on target.

For all the criticism of Celtic's transfer dealings – or lack of – over the summer, Gordon may yet prove to be a superb piece of business.

In a rare lapse of defensive concentration in 59 minutes Emilio Izaguirre gave the ball away in his own half.

Working the ball wide to the left flank Maribor full-back Mitja Viler whipped in a cross for Ibrahimi to direct a downward header towards the bottom right hand corner. Gordon dived full length to push the ball away in a manner which suggested, if he stays fit, that Fraser Forster's departure may prove less than catastrophic.

It was a fleeting moment of concern for Celtic's number one. Of the two goalkeepers Handanovic, at the other end, was by far the busier keeper.

How Celtic left here without a second goal, indeed, remains an enduring mystery.

They controlled the play and crafted a series of chances. The first in 61 minutes saw Stokes claim a handball from Aleksander Rajcevic as he headed a fine cross from McGregor towards goal.

Stokes had a mixed night here, in truth. His best moment came when he controlled the ball with his back to goal, spinning and dragging a low effort from 20 yards wide of goal.

That came during an excellent spell for the Scottish champions.

They should have scored a second in 72 minutes when Johansen embarked on an endless solo run which almost carried him through for a brilliant individual goal. Stokes was screaming for the ball in the centre and would have had a tap in had the Norwegian squared. Instead he stumbled at the crucial moment, allowing Handanovic to deal with the danger.

The Maribor keeper was at it again seconds later, another charging solo run from Virgil van Dijk this time - anding in the Dutchman thudding a 30 yard shot towards the top corner, Handanovic tipping the ball over the bar at the last second.

A second goal was desirable for Celtic. But not essential.

The key was keeping composure in defence until the end. The arrival of Efe Ambrose at right back offered no guarantee of that, but when Gordon produced another excellent save by leaping to push a 30 yard drive from substitute Ales Mertelj over the bar they were edging closer to a very decent first leg outcome.
