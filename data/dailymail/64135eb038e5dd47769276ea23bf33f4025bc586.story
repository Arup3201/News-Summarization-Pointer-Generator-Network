Remains sifted out of the ground zero rubble during the original recovery efforts following the September 11 attacks have been identified as those of a 26-year-old New Jersey man.

Matthew David Yarnell, dubbed a 'merry prankster' in an obituary that appeared in the New York Times, became the 1,640th victim identified from among the debris thanks to DNA testing, NBC New York reports.

Yarnell was vice president of technology at Fiduciary Trust International. He was in a meeting on the 97th floor in the south tower when United Airlines Flight 175 struck.

Family remember the Carnegie Mellon graduate as a funny man. 'He liked to have fun,' his mother Michele Yarnell told the Times not long after the tragedy.

The death toll stemming from the attacks at the World Trade Center stands at 2,753. Of those, 1,113 victims have not been identified through a DNA match to items provided by families — toothbrushes, combs, clothing or swabs from relatives.

With ever-advancing technology yielding results that were impossible a dozen years ago, the unique genetic code gleaned from the bits of bone is the only hope for families waiting for anything tangible to officially confirm what they already know: Their loved one is dead.

In some cases, scientists have gone back to the same bone fragment 10 or 15 times, using new technology to attempt to extract DNA diminished by fire, sunlight, bacteria and even the jet fuel that poured through the towers.

The painstaking process involves pulverizing the bone fragments, adding a special chemical to the powder and then spinning it all in a centrifuge to break open the bone cells so DNA can be extracted. Then comes the last, critical step — looking to match it to an item with the victim's DNA provided by families — part of the medical examiner's collection of 17,000 contributions. 

Family members have long endorsed the ongoing identification process, even as some protested last year's move of the remains to the museum site, which they fear could be prone to flooding.

'Don't put them in the basement,' Rosemary Cain, who lost her firefighter son at the trade center, said at a protest against the move. 'Give them respect so 3,000 souls can rest in peace.'

Other families supported the move, saying the repository is a fitting site for the remains.

'It will show the world the way we treat our dead,' Lee Ielpi, who lost his son in the attacks. 'Let's get them back to the site.'

New technology: With new technology yielding results impossible a dozen years ago, forensic scientists are still trying to match the bone with DNA from those who died on Sept. 11, 2001, and have never been identified

A person demonstrates how to use a device used for milling and extracting DNA, at the Office of Chief Medical Examiner in New York. Yarnell became victim number 1,640 identified from the debris. Over 1,100 remain unidentified 

The question is: How long and at what cost will the forensic team keep working to identify these last 9/11 remains? The team's annual salary budget is $230,000, plus costs for follow-up work by other scientists and staff.

Desire said that as new technology becomes available, the efforts to identify the fragments will continue indefinitely.

Charles Strozier, founding director of the Center on Terrorism at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice, said that work must continue 'because our relationship to the Sept. 11 disaster hinges on being able to identify and pay respects to those who died.'

For Desire, it's not just a grim scientific task — it's personal.

He was under the still-standing towers minutes after the two hijacked planes hit them, having rushed down with the then-chief medical examiner, Dr. Charles Hirsch. As the towers toppled, the men were struck and bloodied by falling glass and debris.

'It's a service and an honor, working on something that has transformed American history,' he said. 

The death toll stemming from the attacks at the World Trade Center stands at 2,753. Of those, 1,113 victims have not been identified through a DNA match to items provided by families — toothbrushes, combs, clothing or swabs from relatives

Impossible to forget:There have been no identifications of 1,113 missing people and 7,703 of the samples of human remains cannot be identified

Yarnell becomes the 1,640th victim positively identified from the rubble.  That leaves 1,113 victims remains still unidentified
