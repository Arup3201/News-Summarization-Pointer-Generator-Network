Arsene Wenger believes Francis Coquelin can be a long-term solution to Arsenal's midfield conundrum after offering the 23-year-old is offered a new contract at the Emirates.

Just over a month ago, the French central midfielder lined up for Championship side Charlton as they travelled to Nottingham Forest for a mid-table clash.

Step forward to mid-January and Coquelin was a major force in Arsenal's win over Manchester City at the Etihad; a potentially title-defining moment in the Premier League.

Speaking ahead of Sunday's FA Cup clash with Brighton, Wenger admitted that Coquelin has shown significant developments in the last year.

'I saw that he made huge improvements in training and I explained to him that for me to give him a potential chance, he needed match practice,' Wenger said. 

'I could not give him that, I could give him that only if he had played somewhere else before. He took the challenge, he came back and since I have played him he is doing well.'

Arsenal have struggled with injury in their midfield this season; Mesut Ozil, Jack Wilshere, Aaron Ramsey, Mikel Arteta and Abou Diaby have all been sidelined, leading to Wenger invoking an emergency recall of Coquelin to bring him back in December.

Wenger admits that he could well be a long-term solution to a problem Arsenal are looking to solve soon.

'Yes, of course. He is a very young player. You look just at what happens on the pitch. Win the ball and make a good pass. In his position that is important,' said Wenger.

To ensure that the Emirates is his home for the foreseeable future, Arsenal have offered the Frenchman a longer contract.

His current deal expires at the end of this season but the Arsenal boss is confident of tying up new terms in the near future.

'Yes, we have offered him a new deal,' Wenger confirmed. 'I am confident that it will be done.'
