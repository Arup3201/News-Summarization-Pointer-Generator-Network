Homes have been evacuated and roads closed on the southern-most Canary Island following a government-issued warning about a possible volcanic eruption.

The southern tip of El Hierro was shaken by a 4.3-magnitude quake late on Saturday as an underwater volcano just off the coast started spewing matter some 60ft into the air.

The island, which has 500 volcanic cones, has experienced more than 10,000 tremors  in the past four months.

Renewed fears of an eruption came as vast quantities of magma - the molten rock from just under the earth's crust - began bubbling into the sea off the port of La Restinga.

A 5.1-magnitude earthquake hit El Hierro in the Canary Islands on Friday suggesting a nearby underwater volcano could soon erupt. This could force rock to emerge from the sea, creating a new island.

Witnessess said that explosive plumes and jets could be seen on the ocean surface from the underwater volcano which began erupting last month. Some of the material is being ejected as high as 60ft into the air.

The regional government of the Spanish 
Canary Island issued a 'yellow' volcanic eruption alert - the 
second on a four-level scale.

La Restinga's 600 residents were evacuated last week after the volcanic activity began.

Now new evacuations have been called for people living along the 
southern end of the island. Authorities have also shut down 
access to La Restinga.

Ships have been ordered away from 
waters around the port and aircraft have been banned from flying over 
the island's southern tip.

The
 regional government of the Canary Islands says scientists have detected
 airborne volcanic fragments called pyroclasts rising from the sea off 
La Restinga.

The 
government said it awaited scientific reports on the danger posed by 
pyroclasts, but a research vessel that was collecting samples there has 
been ordered to stop.

Fears of an eruption have been going since the end of July, when El Hierro experienced the first of what has become more than 10,000 tremors - collectively known as an earthquake 'swarm'.

Residents were evacuated from some areas at the end of September when volcanic activity increased to more than 150 tremors in 24 hours. The army was put on standby for a mass evacuation.

Volcano
 expert Juan Carlos Carrecedo said at the time: 'There is a ball of magma rising to 
the surface producing a series of ruptures which generate seismic 
activity.

'We don't know if that ball of magma will break through the crust and cause an eruption.'

But he warned an eruption was possible 'in days, weeks or months'.

The last eruption on El Hierro was in 1793 and lasted for a month.

The last eruption in the Canary Islands as a whole took place on the island of La Palma in 1971.

 Under the Canary Islands lies 
an area of magma which is able to break through to the surface when the 
African Plate - on which the islands sit - shifts. It is to this that 
the islands owe their very existence.

Most of the islands are 
still volcanically active and there has been speculation that a smaller, previously undetected fault line also runs 
through the chain.

El Hierro - which means 'iron' in 
Spanish - was formed after three volcanic eruptions 100 million years 
ago and is topped by a volcano more than 6,000ft high.

Volcanic

 activity - mainly where three ridge lines converge - has caused El 
Hierro to expand continually. The last time it erupted was in 1793.

Some
 50,000 years ago, massive landslides triggered by earthquakes caused a 
large part of the island to crack off and fall into the Atlantic Ocean, 
according to Irish Weather Online.

That created the El Golfo valley on the island and caused an 300ft-high tsunami that probably reached the American coast.

This
 feeds into the belief that volcanic activity on La Palma - the most 
tectonically active of the Canary Islands - could trigger a 
mega-tsunami.

The theory
 - which has never been confirmed - claims that a possible fault line 
through the island would cause a major landslide under certain 
circumstances.

That 
landslide would then spark a tsunami that would cause extensive damage 
all down the Atlantic Coast of the U.S., the Caribbean, Western Europe, 
West Africa and the east coast of South America.
