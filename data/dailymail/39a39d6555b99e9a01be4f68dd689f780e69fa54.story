Louis van Gaal has wasted no time in revolutionising Manchester United on his arrival at Old Trafford.

The Dutchman has bought exciting new additions to the fold in Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera, with more new faces in the pipeline.

The squad will have a very different feel to it regardless of signings, though, as Van Gaal is just as intent on clearing out the deadwood.

Meet the new boss: Louis van Gaal will be shipping out some familiar faces in his Old Trafford revolution

During the club's successful pre-season tour, the new manager admitted there would be several casualties of his squad revamp.

He said: 'I shall make judgements after this tour. 'I have let all the players play and I know now more than before the tour.

'Now also it is a little bit soon to judge but in football you have to judge. You have to give the player a chance to make a transfer when I see that his prospects to play are not so high.

'You have to say it in advance because it’s too late after August 31. I will tell payers after the tour.'

Here, Sportsmail assesses who will be cast aside in the new United, and which clubs will be able to pick up the pieces.  

Marouane Fellaini

The Belgian was United's sole signing last summer, and his mediocre performances in the middle of the park became synonymous with David Moyes' dismal reign. 

How much: United expect to take a hit on the £27.5million they paid and want £20million but will do well to get £15million.

Who's interested: Napoli but not at the asking price. A subsidised loan suits them but they are already weighing up alternatives.

Flop: Marouane Fellaini became synonymous with David Moyes' disastrous reign at Old Trafford 

Javier Hernandez

'Chicharito' has an impressive goals to games ratio in a United shirt, but his detractors suggest he needs more to his game. He's well behind the likes of Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie in the pecking order and will find more opportunities elsewhere. 

How much: £12million would be the Mexican's price ideal but United expect closer to £10million.

Who's interested: Juventus and Inter Milan, Atletico Madrid, Tottenham and Southampton are just some of the clubs to have expressed an interest.

Poacher: But Javier Hernandez, battling against Liverpool, could be surplus to requirements

Anderson

The Portuguese has failed to live up to his reputation, with a torrid spell at Old Trafford rife with injury. With no pre-season form behind him, by now he is well down the list of Louis van Gaal's midfielders.

How much: United are struggling to find takers even at a knockdown £5million.

Who's interested: Clubs in Portugal and Brazil have shown interest but little else. His displays on loan at Fiorentina did little to impress. Anderson may be difficult to shift.

Nani

The mercurial winger has had a career of ups and downs at Old Trafford, but it may finally be time to move on. His frustratingly inconsistent displays, along with a incompatibility with Van Gaal's wing-backs system means his United number is up. 

How much: A new five year deal raised his value last season but price will be around £12million to £15million.

Who's interested: Juventus, Inter Milan, Valencia and Arsenal still rate the Portuguese winger despite his inconsistency.

Shinji Kagawa

Sir Alex Ferguson bought the hotly-tipped Japanese playmaker in from Borussia Dortmund to revolutionise the Red Devils' attacking threat. Although he has impressed in spells, injuries and the arrival of Juan Mata means Kagawa may have to look elsewhere for regular action. 

How much: United will look to get around £8million to £10million for the Japanese playmaker.

Who's interested: Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp loves Kagawa. Atletico Madrid are interested too in a player who has looked resigned to leaving. Plenty interested in a loan.

Return of the prodigal son? Shinji Kagawa could be in line for a return to Borussia Dortmund

Wilfried Zaha

The winger was tipped as an England World Cup star on his arrival from Crystal Palace, but has failed to live up to the hype. Farmed out on loan to Cardiff last season and another who doesn't benefit from a wing-backs formation, his move to United may have been one gamble too far.

How much: United would do well to raise £10million and may prefer to send him out on loan and see if his value rises again.

Who's interested: West Ham, QPR, Crystal Palace and Newcastle would all take a chance on a player who has yet to show his potential.

Gamble: Wilfried Zaha has not lived up to his billing since joining Man United and could be on his way
