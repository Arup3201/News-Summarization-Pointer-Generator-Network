When freelance writer Siena Dexter logged on to her iCloud service and saw that a picture of a cross-dressing man planting a kiss on a young woman had been uploaded – it gave her quite a shock.

After all, she didn’t know who the pair were – and the image had been taken using an iPhone stolen from her a few months’ previously.

And that wasn’t the only picture the stolen iPhone had synced to iCloud.

Who are these men? Several 'selfie' shots of strangers also appeared on Ms Dexter's iCloud account

Several headshots of two men appeared along with a snap of a man sitting next to a White City Tube sign.

The phone was taken from Ms Dexter, 30, in June in Clapham, south London. She immediately reported the theft, had the phone blocked by provider EE and lamented the fact that she would have to take an old phone with her on holiday to Spain shortly afterwards.

She told MailOnline: ‘It was stolen outside a cashpoint on Clapham High Street at the end of a night out. I had lost my friend and between the moment when I pulled the phone out to call her and the moment when I turned round to take money out of the machine, the phone was taken. We called the device which rang and then immediately went dead.

Smiles better: Siena Dexter during happier times with her iPhone

‘I had to take a handset from the dark ages on holiday. Forget a camera, it didn't even have predictive text. I think the damage to my thumbs is reversible, but the emotional trauma, that I have to live with forever.'

A small clue as to who might have the phone appeared the following morning, but it wasn’t enough to crack the case.

Ms Dexter said: ‘The very next day I checked iCloud - where all my contacts were stored - and noticed something funny in the notes section. A shopping list in Italian! I called the police immediately but they said unless I knew where the phone was, there was nothing they could do and this was not enough to go on.’

However, the trail warmed up just recently when Ms Dexter received a new iPhone and connected to iCloud again.

The batch of photos featuring complete strangers had been streamed to it, along with several new phone numbers.

One number was labelled as Mio Numero Nuovo!, Italian for ‘my new number’ – and Ms Dexter decided to call it.

Someone answered, but promptly hung up. MailOnline also rang this number, but again, the person who answered quickly ended the call.

Although Ms Dexter felt ‘totally violated’ when she saw the pictures, they have given the police something more to work with.

It is not clear, however, which if any of the people pictured in the photographs now has the phone, or if they knew it was stolen.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said: ‘I can confirm that an allegation was made to police of a mobile phone theft that took place in Clapham High Street in the early hours of the 22 June.

‘Officers would like to speak to the men pictured in the images in connection with the investigation. There have been no arrests.’ 

If you think you can help the police with this case call Crimestoppers on 0800 555 111.

Cloud is a free service that works with applications on an iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac or PC to automatically and wirelessly store customers' content in iCloud and automatically and wirelessly push it to all their devices. When anything changes on one of the devices, they all wirelessly update almost instantly.

For example, when a photo is taken on an 
iPhone - as in the case of write Siena Dexter - it is sent to the user’s
iCloud account and then automatically downloaded to the user’s iPad, 
laptop and computer, making it both a storage tool and a system to keep 
all data synchronised across multiple devices.

The iCloud service secures data by encrypting it when it is sent over the Internet, storing it in an encrypted format when kept on server and using secure tokens for authentication. This means users' data is protected from unauthorised access both while it is being transmitted and when it is stored in the cloud. iCloud uses the same level of security employed by major financial institutions – and never provides encryption keys to any third parties.

Because all the user’s data is stored remotely by iCloud, it means that if an iPhone, iPad or computer is stolen, the contents will not be lost. iCloud was launched on October 12, 2011, and has 320million users.
