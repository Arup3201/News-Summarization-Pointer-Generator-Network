A Chicago cab driver was arrested this week after a female passenger said she fell asleep in the back of his car and woke up to him sexually assaulting her.

Tajamul Hussain Syed, 23, was arrested Thursday driving his cab in Evanston, Illinois.

He now faces criminal sexual assault charges and is being held on $250,000 bail as of Saturday, according to the Chicago Tribune.

According to prosecutors, Syed picked up a female passenger in the early hours of November 1 after she spent Halloween night celebrating with a friend.

The woman says she fell asleep in the car and the next thing she remembers was waking up to find her costume pants pulled down and Syed sexually assaulting her.

She says she pushed him off her, got out of the cab and ran home.
