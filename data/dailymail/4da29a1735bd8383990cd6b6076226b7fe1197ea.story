Foreign criminals and illegal immigrants have pocketed almost £17million in compensation for being locked up for too long while officials fight to deport them, it has been revealed.

Sex offenders, robbers and drug dealers who are not supposed to be in Britain have been paid huge sums of taxpayers’ money because they were wrongly detained by the Home Office.

In a slap in the face to the British public, at least 229 offenders were among more than 480 individuals handed controversial payouts for being unlawfully held under immigration powers in the past four years.

Even though Home Secretary Theresa May wanted them removed from the UK, hundreds sued, claiming their human right to liberty had been breached.

Last night MPs and campaigners condemned the cost to the public purse and said judges who awarded the vast payments, averaging around £25,000, were making a mockery of the justice system.

Conservative MP Michael Ellis, who sits of the Commons’ home affairs committee, said: ‘No wonder people think the law is an ass. To hear of some cases where dangerous criminals have been given large amounts of money is tantamount to a perversion of the justice system. People will be appalled.’

Unlawful: Nemah Shehadeh was held for a year

Nemah Shehadeh was awarded £36,000 after being held following an attempt to deport her to Jordan.

The deportation failed in January 2008 when she claimed to be a Palestinian.

A judge at the Court of Session in Edinburgh ruled that the then 58-year-old was unlawfully detained for one year from August 2008.

She was originally issued with a six-month visitor visa to come to Britain on the basis that she was a Jordanian citizen.

She arrived in August 2002 but overstayed.

She was arrested in 2005 at Heathrow with a son when they were attempting to use false French passports to travel to Canada, and subsequently sentenced to four months imprisonment with a recommendation for deportation.

After the failed bid to deport her to Jordan, the Home Office placed her in detention while her case was for release considered – with rigorous reporting restrictions. 

Judges agreed this was unlawful and ordered compensation.

Immigration Minister James Brokenshire revealed that £4.5million was paid out in 2011-12, £5million in 2012-13, £4.8million in 2013-14 and £2.1million so far in the year to September. That amounts to £16.4million compensation. Of this, at least £6.2million was awarded to 229 criminals who had been unlawfully detained while waiting to be booted out of the country after finishing prison sentences – roughly £27,000 per offender.

The UK does not specify how long people can be kept in immigration detention before deportation, with Home Office guidance saying it should not extend beyond a ‘reasonable period’.

But some cases involve illegal immigrants who refuse to reveal where they are from so the authorities have to waste time trying to locate their homelands. Others put in multiple appeals or asylum claims over several years to try to ‘frustrate’ attempts to remove them, said Mandie Campbell, the director general of Immigration Enforcement at the Home Office.

Many cases also involve criminals who the Home Office do not want to release amid concerns they are a risk of committing more crimes or absconding.

In one instance, Joseph Mjemer – branded a ‘one-man crime wave’ – was jailed for two years just a year after winning £17,360 compensation for being unlawfully detained while awaiting deportation. He used at least five aliases and claimed to be from four countries.

Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the Taxpayers’ Alliance pressure group, said payouts could be avoided if Home Office staff were more efficient.

‘Taxpayers will be furious that their cash is being wasted thanks to Home Office bungling,’ he said. ‘Unlawful detention doesn’t just hurt those who are kept under lock and key, but costs an extraordinary amount. The authorities must do a better job.’

Former coalition minister Sarah Teather, who uncovered the figures, accused the Home Office of treating people inhumanely and costing the taxpayer millions.

‘It appears that the Home Office would sometimes rather detain people indefinitely than treat them humanely, even if this ends up costing the taxpayer millions of pounds,’ said the Lib Dem MP. ‘But these figures shouldn’t obscure the considerable emotional and mental cost that not knowing how long you might be detained for, or if you’re going to be deported tomorrow, or moved hundreds of miles away to a different detention centre, has on detainees.’

The UK made the second-highest use of detention for asylum seekers in Europe in 2013, with more than 30,000 asylum seekers spending some time in detention. Some who have been paid compensation have subsequently been deported, while others remain in the UK.
