There will be a repeat of last season's FA Cup final in this year's third round after Hull City were drawn to play Arsenal at the Emirates - although Tigers boss Steve Bruce originally thought the game was at the KC Stadium.

Arsenal came from two goals down to beat Hull 3-2 at Wembley after extra-time in May and there will now be another encounter between the two sides.

Bruce not only mistakenly thought his side had been drawn at home, he also revealed that they had also been paired with Arsenal in the rehearsal.

The draw was even held at The Deep Aquarium in Hull with Bruce in the audience.

'We'd been drawn against Arsenal in the rehearsal,' Bruce told BBC Sport.

'Let's hope it is as good as the final, because it was a great game.

'It's quite remarkable because as soon as we walked in everybody couldn't wait to tell us we'd been drawn against Arsenal in the rehearsal which is quite unique in itself - and then for it to happen again, it's just an amazing draw.'

The tie will be a repeat of last season's final, which Arsenal won 3-2 after extra-time

Amusingly, host Mark Chapman had to return to Bruce and say to him: 'I'd forgotten this but you're actually away.'

To which Bruce replied with a chuckle: 'Oh, we're away? We're not out first? I'm in shock!'

Chapman then responded: 'I'll leave you with that thought...'

Hull captain  Davies was also present.

He said: 'I guess it was just meant to be. Hearing about the rehearsal and it being here, in Hull, we were looking forward to (the draw).

'To be first out of the hat with Arsenal was a shock, but we're looking forward to that.

'We just have to look forward to going there, giving them a good game and hopefully getting through to the next round.'
