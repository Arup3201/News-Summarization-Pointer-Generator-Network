Conman: Darren Aston befriended an elderly couple before gaining a Power of Attorney to transfer their money to try and save his business. He has been jailed for five years

An estate agent who left an elderly couple 'destitute' after conning them out of more than £260,000 has been jailed for five years.

Darren Aston, 42, from Shirley, Birmingham, used a Power of Attorney he obtained after befriending Marjorie Willits, 92, and Eric Dickinson 87 to funnel cash into his failing business.

He had gained the trust of the pensioners are running errands, accompanying them on hospital visits after they suffered strokes and cooking Sunday lunch in their home.

After being granted the Power of Attorney when the couple’s health deteriorated further, he then used it to drain their bank accounts of a total of £264,173.18 in just ten months.

Aston initially denied two counts of fraud but later changed his plea during a trial at Birmingham Crown Court.

He admitted stealing a total of £179.319.18 from Mrs Willits and £84.854 from Mr Dickinson. Two further counts of theft will lie on file.

Judge Melbourne Inman QC told Aston the impact of his crimes on the couple, who now live in nursing homes, had been 'extreme,' adding: 'You could not find two more vulnerable victims.'

The judge added that Marjorie Willits had wanted to live out her days at home but Aston’s actions meant she could no longer afford the care to do so.

He told Aston: 'The position is now that Marjorie is 93 years of age, and Eric 87. Sadly whilst this was going on his health has deteriorated. Marjorie is in better health but is still very ill.

'I have to consider the amount of harm together with the degree of culpability.

'The level of harm caused is extreme, it is not simply the amount of money that was taken, but the amount of money that they had.

'She can’t understand why anyone would want to treat her like that. No doubt she blames herself.

'Now Marjorie can’t do what she wanted to do, because she wanted to leave assets to people who had helped her.'

The court heard that the estate agent’s crimes were uncovered when Marjorie Willits feared Aston may have cashed in £30,000 worth of premium bonds as she was no longer receiving regular payments.

Police probed Aston’s financial dealings and unearthed a number of cheques and banker’s drafts made out to his company Key Moves - totalling almost £160,000 - plus a consistent pattern of sizeable cash withdrawals.

Aston claimed much of the money was a private loan agreement he intended to pay back and that he also had permission to take out cash in 'bits and bobs'.

But investigators revealed what Aston classed as bits and bobs actually amounted to £100,000.

Investigating officer DC Vicky Henry, said: 'Aston transferred large sums of money on a regular basis to help clear his debts - he left his elderly victims financially barren with little or no balance left in their bank accounts.

'Aston slyly weaved his way into the couple’s confidence, he played the role of a helping hand there to offer support - but all along he was targeting their money to help dig himself out of a financial hole.

'Through our detailed enquiries we established a strong case against Aston, showing when he’d removed money without permission, yet he insisted his innocence until the very last minute.

'We will recover as much of the money as possible from him, and seizing assets, under the Proceeds of Crime Act.'

In a victim impact statement read out in court, Mrs Willits said she 'wished' she suffered from dementia like Mr Dickinson so she could be spared the knowledge of Aston’s crimes.

She said: 'I am pleased Aston pleaded guilty, but cannot understand why he would do this to me other than that it was purely greed.

'I feel all of the pressures in relation to this case have been placed on me as Eric had dementia and had no knowledge of what happened.

'I wish I was in his position so I would not have all these responsibility and worries.

'I’d like to thank everyone who has helped me. I now desperately want to return to my home where I have lived for 50 years.

'I have started struggling to see and nothing more can be taken from me now.

'I have spent most of my time at the care home in bed as I have been too tired to get up.

'The staff have been great but I just need to be back at my home now.’
