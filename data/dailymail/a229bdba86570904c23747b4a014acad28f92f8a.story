A man who allegedly admitted to molesting his cousin when she was 13 is now suing her for defamation and stalking.

James Rashawn Johnson is petitioning for a civil injunction to stop his cousin Ashley Foster using his name or photographs when she tells her story of how she was molested.

Foster, 23, claims Johnson molested her for six years until she was 19, but he was never prosecuted because when she reported him two years ago, too much time had passed since the alleged offense.

Refusing to back down, Foster launched an online campaign to eliminate Florida's statute of limitations in cases like hers, and used her cousin's name and pictures.

Johnson wants her to stop identifying him because he has never been charged.

Alleged victim: Ashley Foster, 23 (pictured), claims her cousin molested her for six years and has fought to have Florida's statute of limitation for child molestation lifted

Accused: James Rashawn Johnson (pictured left and right), a father, allegedly admitted to molesting his female cousin for six years

'My picture appeared on Facebook as 'a predator', which I have never been arrested, prosecuted, or convicted of,' he wrote in a statement filed in Broward County court, according to WPTV.

Johnson, a father, has not commented publicly on the case.

Foster, however, said she refuses to be silenced and would only stop using Johnson's image and name if ordered by a court.

'I felt re-victimized now,' the Boynton Beach woman told WPBF. 'I have a First Amendment right to tell my story. And he made my story.'

Her mother, Darlene Foster, added: 'She's not shutting up. She's not going to back down. And that's the Ashley I'm proud of.'

Campaign: Ashley Foster created a Facebook page 'Ashley's Law' in October 2013 campaigning for Florida's statute of limitation on child molestation to be eliminated, to enable alleged offenders to be prosecuted

Show of strength: Ashley Foster told her story to Florida legislators in February. In March, 'Ashley's Law' passed, eliminating the state's three-year statute of limitations on child molestation

Foster said she kept her alleged abuse a secret until two years ago because she was afraid of her family's reaction.

After telling her mother, she allegedly recorded Johnson admitting his crime and apologizing.

She took the recording to Boynton Beach Police who, according to WPTV, had a strong case against Johnson but couldn't prosecute because the statute of limitations had run out just 60 days before.

'I was like, 'Oh, you've got to be kidding me',' Foster said. 'We're going to have to change this.'

Last year, she started a Facebook page, Ashley's Law - and an online campaign - to change state law to eliminate the statute of limitations in cases like hers. It worked.

She told her story to Florida lawmakers who passed the bill, with the governor signing Ashley's Law on April 1.

'She has a right to say his name and talk about it and warn people of it and that's exactly what she did,' Darlene Foster, Ashley's mother, said.

But now Johnson claims he is being defamed by the Facebook page and fliers all around his neighborhood and workplace accusing him of molesting his cousin.Â 

The court will hear the case next week.
