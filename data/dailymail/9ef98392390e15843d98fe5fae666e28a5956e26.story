The presence of 33-year-old Gareth Barry in southern Russia for Thursday night's game against Krasnodar underlines that Everton and their manager Roberto Martinez are taking the Europa League seriously.

Barry was one of the Aston Villa players controversially left out of a tie in the same competition against CSKA Moscow in 2009 – a move that backfired on manager Martin O'Neill who was pilloried by fans thereafter and resigned the following year.

Yet, despite being sandwiched between big Premier League clashes against Liverpool and Manchester United, Barry has been asked to travel nearly 5,000 miles by Martinez – as have other big-hitters Tim Howard, Leighton Baines, Phil Jagielka and Romelu Lukaku.

Roberto Martinez wants to win the Europa League and has selected a strong squad to face Krasnodar 

Martinez, in his first European campaign as a manager and already with three points on the board after beating Wolfsburg, says emphatically: 'Of course we are taking this seriously. I don’t think it is a question mark.

'We got in Europe because we worked hard for 12 months. If we want to carry on developing and growing we need to develop a winning mentality and to do that we need to be ready for the next game.

'I think the squad is big enough, we have had a few injuries and they are going to put a bit of pressure in terms of demands on certain players and we maybe have to regenerate them further down the line in the season.

'In terms of taking the game seriously, I expect every game to be a real test to go as far as we can go and I want that to be the mentality in the club. We cannot afford to dismiss any game this season, it is the opposite.

'I always felt that European football is part of our DNA, we started back in this competition in the 50s and every opportunity to create a good memory we take it with both hands.

'It is the first time we have come to Russia, yes we will make changes but that does not mean we don’t want to win. We expect that everyone on the pitch knows what it means to play for Everton and wants to win. And they will be able to cope with this club wanting to win every game, that’s the mentality.'

If Howard gets the nod over Joel Robles, it will be the American goalkeeper's 21st game in Europe for Everton – a club record.

Kevin Mirallas is out of the match and will be on the sidelines for around eight weeks with a hamstring injury 

Manchester United await on Sunday lunchtime and three players with injury problems James McCarthy, Seamus Coleman and Steven Pienaar have stayed at home for treatment. It is possible all three will be able to face United, with Pienaar considered likeliest.

Belgian international Kevin Mirallas is also missing with a hamstring injury that is likely to keep him out for several weeks.

Krasnodar, formed as recently as 2008, are unbeaten in the Russian League this season after nine games though they are also something of draw specialists and got a 1-1 result in Lille in their opening group game.

Everton's 500-strong army of travelling fans will be supplemented by a group of Russian Toffees, a fan club set up after former Russian international Andriy Kanchelskis played at Goodison Park.

Kransnodar defender Andreas Granqvist played 14 times for Wigan in the Premier League.
