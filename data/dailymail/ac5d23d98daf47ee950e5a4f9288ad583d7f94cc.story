NPR host Diane Rehm has talked about her husband's painful and drawn out death as she calls for improvements in assisted dying laws.

When Rehm's husband John, who had been suffering from Parkinson's, made the decision to end his life there was only one option open to him - dehydration.

Weakened by the disease, and no longer able to use his limbs, Mr Rehm had asked his doctor for help but was told that wasn't possible in Maryland, where the couple live.

Instead, Mr Rehm's family had to stand by helplessly for nine days, after he refused all liquids and died a slow and uncomfortable death last month.

'John said he felt betrayed. He said, "I felt that when the time came, [doctors] would be able to help me",' Rehm told NBC News.

For Rehm, who had been married to John for 54 years, it was heartbreaking to watch her husband suffer.

In the months leading up to his death, Mr Rehm's condition had become progressively worse.

'He just kept getting weaker. We called in the doctor and John said to him: "I am
 ready today". He said "I can no longer use my legs, I can no longer use
 my arms, I can no longer feed myself",' Rehm said.

She said her husband had told his doctor directly that he wanted to die, and asked for his help. 

But the doctor had to tell the couple that 'legally, morally, ethically' he was unable to offer assisted dying.

Mr Rehm's only option was to refuse all food and liquid - a process that can take a few weeks before the patient dies.

During that time, they are likely to suffer headaches, leg cramps and delirium.

'We do not let our little animals suffer and people shouldn’t have to suffer,' Rehm told NBC as she described how she had desperately wanted to ease her husband's suffering during his final days.

'It wasn’t easy to watch [but] you have to respect someone else’s wishes. You have to honor his 
desires. And he was finished with life,' she said.

Barbara Coombs Lee, president of campaign group Compassion and Choices, said Mr Rehm should have been given better choices about how he ended his life.

'I have no
 doubt that he was terminally ill and if he was in Oregon he would have 
qualified for aid in dying,' she said.

Despite some polls showing 65 percent of Americans supporting patients being allowed some option for a quicker or pain free death, laws on assisted dying vary widely state from state.

Compassion and Choices doesn't support euthanisa, and draws a distinction between what is known as assisted suicide and giving a terminally ill patient more say in their end of life care.

It suggests that doctors should be allowed to prescribe a lethal dose of drugs for a patient to take as they chose.

'Assisted suicide is a crime in many states, including Oregon and Washington, where aid in dying is legal,' the group says.

Assisted dying is also legal in Vermont and Montana, and several other states have debated introducing it.

For radio show host Rehm, giving choice and help to patients who are suffering, like her husband was, is the humane way forward.

It
 would allow a doctor to prescribe a lethal dose of drugs for a patient 
to take as he or she chose.

'I would like to, in every state across the 
country, in every city, in every county, I would very much like to see a
 justification, an allowance, for aid in dying,' Rehm said.
