A British pensioner has been trampled to death by a wild elephant at a jungle waterhole in India.

Retired geography teacher Colin Manvell, 67, went off alone on foot to take photographs of a kingfisher – and never returned.

According to a forest warden, the keen birdwatcher was attacked by a bull elephant which knocked him to the ground with its trunk, then stomped on him.

He was found badly injured as the elephant trumpeted nearby. With no doctor present at the local hospital, he died soon after.

A friend in England said last night that the skilled photographer was hard of hearing, so may not have heard the animal approaching.

Police in India were checking how the tragedy happened, with some reports suggesting Mr Manvell should not have been in the spot where he died.

The pensioner, of Havant in Hampshire, had become a regular visitor to India in recent years, and produced impressive photographs of wildlife, including images of elephants at play, and close-ups of birds and butterflies.

His latest trip to the sub-continent began just over a week ago. He was so used to going to the country that when he found all hotels booked up he was able to stay with a friend instead, and with the help of a forest guide – named only as M Kumar – planned a visit to the Masinagudi zone of the Mudumalai National Park in the southern state of Tamil Nadu.

The park contains extensive forest and includes a protected tiger reserve. It also has a number of areas where guides are not supposed to take their clients.

Guide Mr Kumar said yesterday: ‘After lunch on Thursday, sir (Mr Manvell) went out on foot for bird watching near a lake which is a watering hole of wild elephants.

‘When he did not return by 4.15pm, we followed his trail and heard the sounds of a tusker (elephant) trumpeting loudly.’

A forest warden who goes by one name, Gnanadoss, supported the suggestions that Mr Manvell did not notice the adult male elephant until it was too late.

He said: ‘It swiped him with its trunk and then trampled him on the ground.’

The forest warden added that the tragedy occurred 100 yards from a site where a woman was killed by elephants in 2009.

The retired geography teacher loved to travel and was a keen photographer

He had been visiting a tour guide in India whom he travelled with twice a year when the fatal elephant attack happened

Mr Manvell was taken from the scene bleeding from his injuries but there were no doctors at the local hospital to treat him. He was driven to a medical centre in Cuddalore, more than 14 miles away, but died on the way.

Mr Kumar added: ‘He knew his way all around here. He was aware of the wild elephants and also the other dangers that lurk in the jungles. This is tragic.’

Last night Mr Manvell’s brother Derek, 74, said: ‘In the last five years safaris have become his passion. He has been out there twice a year.

‘His guide and friend found him on the ground. He died doing something he loved.’

Mr Manvell’s nephew Roger Manvell, 47, said: ‘Our main focus is trying to get the body back home.’

Divorcee Mr Manvell had been head of geography at Warblington School in Havant.
