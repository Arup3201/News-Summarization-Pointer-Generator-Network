Chris Ashton's participation in the Heineken Cup final is in doubt after it emerged that his crass attempt to put off Harlequins goal-kicker Nick Evans in Saturday’s Aviva Premiership semi-final is being investigated by the RFU.

With the Saracens crowd keeping a respectful silence, Ashton could be clearly heard inside the ground shouting ‘Miss!’ as he attempted to charge down Evans’s conversion of Mike Brown’s try on the stroke of half-time.

His actions sparked a melee in the tunnel as incensed Harlequins players - including Ashton’s England team-mates Brown, Joe Marler and Danny Care - confronted the Saracens winger to let him know what they thought of his behaviour.

Controversial moment: Ashton's Heineken Cup final participation is now in doubt

Referee Wayne Barnes, who had earlier sent two Saracens players - Marcelo Bosch and Matt Stevens - to the sin bin, chose not to penalise Ashton despite the angry exchanges which continued down the tunnel.

The RFU decided against citing the player but Sportsmail has learned that the RFU’s head of discipline, Gerard McEvilly, is investigating the  incident and Ashton could yet face a misconduct charge. In the worst-case scenario, he could receive a ban although it is understood a written warning is the most likely sanction.

Whatever the outcome, the incident will not have gone unnoticed by England head coach Stuart Lancaster as he considers his tour party for New Zealand. Ashton, who has 37 caps, was left out of England’s 6 Nations squad but with Exeter winger Jack Nowell recently having knee and shoulder surgery, he is in contention for a recall following his exceptional recent form.

‘Humility and honesty are  written up on the walls around the stadium,’ said an unimpressed Quins director of rugby Conor O’Shea after the game.

‘It (Ashton’s shout) wasn’t something you’d expect someone to do but we’ll leave it.’

Ashton went on to score a try as Saracens overhauled a 17-11 half-time deficit with a commanding second-half display which saw Mark McCall’s men score 20 unanswered points to power their way into a final against Northampton and give themselves hope of an historic domestic and European double.

Turnaround: Ashton is back in contention for an England call-up after his impressive form of late

Leicester fly-half Owen Williams has been cited for alleged eye-gouging against Northampton’s Luther Burrell in Friday’s Aviva Premiership semi-final defeat. If found guilty, Williams could be banned for up to three years.

Saracens 
are doubtful about the participation of talismanic captain Steve 
Borthwick in next Saturday’s Heineken Cup final against Toulon after he 
left the field to a standing ovation with 10 minutes remaining, 
clutching his shoulder.

The
 former England captain will retire at the end of the season, when he is
 expected to join former Saracens coach Eddie Jones on Japan’s coaching 
team ahead of next year’s World Cup, and he had been hoping for a 
fairytale ending to his playing career.

That
 now looks in jeopardy after it emerged that Borthwick - the most capped
 Premiership player of all time - has been suffering from the injury for
 six weeks.

‘We hope he is OK because a career as wonderful as his does not deserve to finish now,’ said Saracens director of rugby McCall. ‘He deserves to finish in two weeks’ time. We’ll know more in the next 48 hours.’

Harlequins full back Brown is also an injury concern for Lancaster after he was forced off late in the game suffering pain in his hamstring and lower groin.

Brown is understood to have complained at half-time about the synthetic Allianz Park pitch catching his studs and causing difficulties with his running style.

He will be monitored by England and Harlequins medics over the next 48 hours.
