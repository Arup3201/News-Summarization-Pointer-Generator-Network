Rafael Nadal will decide on his participation in November's ATP World Tour Finals later this month.

Spanish radio reports had claimed on Wednesday that the world No 3 was to miss the season-ending tournament in London due to appendix surgery.

But Nadal's spokeperson later denied the claim and insisted that he will make a decision following the ATP Swiss Indoors in Basle next week.

He said: 'Rafa is playing Basle and depending on how he feels and what the doctors say will decide then, after the tournament, on what’s best.'

Nadal, 28, lost in the second-round of the Shanghai Masters last week after being diagnosed with appendicitis.

Afterwards he confirmed that he will have to undergo surgery at the end of his season, although it is unclear at the moment when that will be.

One interested observer will be Andy Murray, who is currently in 10th position in the Race to London, two places outside the cut.

Nadal's withdrawal would free up a spot, while there are also some doubts whether Novak Djokovic will play at the O2 Arena with his first child due in November.

Murray continues his qualification bid in Vienna this week at the Erste Bank Open, where he opens his campaign on Thursday against world No 44 Vasek Pospisil.
