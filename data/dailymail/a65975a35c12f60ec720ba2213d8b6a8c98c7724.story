Stalemate: Syria's deputy prime minister Qadri Jamil claims that the civil war has reached a stalemate

President Bashar Assad's regime has admitted that neither side is capable of defeating the other and the country's civil war has reached a stalemate.

Syria's deputy prime minister Qadri Jamil appeared to call for a ceasefire as he suggested there was a 'zero balance of forces' which would not change for a while.

He insisted the old regime was at an end but urged the Western world to 'get off our shoulders' while progressive reforms are being made.

He told the Guardian:
 'Neither the armed opposition nor the regime is capable of defeating 
the other side. This zero balance of forces will not change for a while.

'Let
 nobody have any fear that the regime in its present form will continue.
 For all practical purposes the regime in its previous form has ended.

'In order to realise our progressive reforms we need the west and all those who are involved in Syria to get off our shoulders.'

Syria's main Western-backed opposition group, meanwhile, has slammed al-Qaida-linked gunmen and their expanding influence in the country, saying the jihadis seek to establish an Islamic state in Syria.

A statement on Friday from the Syrian National Coalition follows days of vicious infighting in which the extremists seized control of the northern town of Azaz from mainstream opposition fighters.

The SNC says the actions of the al-Qaida-linked fighters 'counter the principals that the Syrian revolution is trying to achieve'.

The group also warns that the Islamic fighters are 'strengthening their positions' in opposition-controlled areas.

The infighting threatens to further split opposition forces and could strengthen President Bashar Assad's hand.

The comments came as Nick Clegg said Britain will look to press other 
countries at the United Nations next week to provide more money to ease 
the Syrian humanitarian crisis.

The
 Deputy Prime Minister, who leads the UK delegation to the UN's general 
assembly in New York, warned not enough cash is being sent to the region
 to help the millions of people displaced and 'traumatised' by the 
conflict.

Asked what proposals his government 
would make at the forthcoming conference in Geneva, Mr Jamil said: 'An 
end to external intervention, a ceasefire and the launching of a 
peaceful political process in a way that the Syrian people can enjoy 
self-determination without outside intervention and in a democratic 
way.'

Mr
 Jamil claimed the report by UN weapons inspectors into the use of 
chemical weapons in Damascus was 'not thoroughly objective' and could 
not be sure it was perpetrated by Assad.

Mr Clegg was speaking after Oxfam suggested many large countries are contributing just a tiny fraction of their 'fair share' of cash needed to deal with the consequences of the crisis.

The aid agency singled out governments which have been prominent in the diplomatic battle over Syria for failing to play their part in tackling the refugee crisis - including Russia and France.

Calling for an end to the violence: Syria's deputy prime minister Qadri Jamil appeared to call for a ceasefire in his latest interview

The UK is contributing around £400 million. The UN's £3 billion appeal for money for Syria, the largest in its history, remains just 44 per cent funded three months after it was launched. Other international appeals are also struggling, with Oxfam 61 per cent short of its £30.7 million target.

It is thought more than 100,000 people have been killed and seven million Syrians displaced.Mr Clegg said the conflict has inflicted 'incalculable' physical, mental and psychological traumas.

Speaking to non-governmental organisations in London last night, Mr Clegg said: 'There is just not enough money being mobilised to deal with the scale of the humanitarian crisis in Syria.

'We have sought to take a lead. We are the second largest donor of humanitarian assistance, funded from the public purse, in Syria.

Indignant: Syrian President Bashar al Assad used his latest televised interview to say that there is still no evidence that his soldiers used chemical weapons

Under attack: Assad maintained that the government was continually being attacked by outside terrorist groups who are masquerading as internal opposition forces

'(Prime Minister David Cameron) was very active on this in the recent G20 summit in St Petersburg, we've allocated another £50 million or so bringing the total of our humanitarian assistance to around £400 million.

'We are looking to other countries to increase their provision and their support as well, so we cannot only get the right means through access, not only the right focus - particularly on children - but also the right resources to help play a role... to do our best to provide humanitarian assistance to those millions and millions of people who have been displaced and traumatised by the conflict.'

Mr Clegg said he wants to 'really hammer home' the focus on children.

He said: 'The knock-on effects, the shadow which will be cast long into the future by the physical, mental, psychological traumas being inflicted on children now I think are incalculable and they need to be at the very heart of our thinking as we try and provide humanitarian assistance and help to this war-ravaged country.'

Horror: Hundreds of children were killed in the attack which reportedly rained nerve gas upon thousands near the Syrian capital of Damascus
