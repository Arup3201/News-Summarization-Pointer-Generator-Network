The first details of Facebook's mobile phone have revealed a new 'home' app - and it could turn any Android handset into a 'Facebook Phone'.

According to website Android Police, the software will be unveiled alongside a handset developed by the social networking giant and phone maker HTC at a special event on Thursday.

Codenamed Myst, the handset is expected to feature dedicated Facebook menus and screens.

The first screenshots of the app reveal it looks remarkably similar to the existing app - but is expected to be integrated into the phone's menus and home screen as well.

The new app is expected to be called Facebook home, according to one site

Android Police said it had been unable to sign in to the new app as only Facebook employees had access to it.

however, they managed to find the rough specs of the HTC phone, and also believe the software will be made available from Google for other Android handsets - although these versions may only have limited features.

'According to this rom, the Facebook Phone looks to be a mostly stock, mid-range Sense 4.5 phone that was attacked by a mutant Facebook app,' the site said.

'Everything seems to be focused on the Facebook app - they haven't made their own Android Skin, or anything like that.

'Sadly, we can't get too many more details, because just about everything requires that you have special access to Facebook.'

The software is believed to also act as a 'launcher', so can take over the user's home screen to show their Facebook friends and updates.

The leaked information also reveals a chat app that can place windows on any other app.
