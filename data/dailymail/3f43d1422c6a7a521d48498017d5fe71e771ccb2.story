An 88-year-old woman who fell at home and had to crawl into her garden to shout for help because her phone line was not working has been offered just 96p compensation by BT.Henrietta Stokes fractured her hip and spent three weeks in hospital recovering from two falls in three days at her bungalow in Longton, Stafforshire.She twice had to shout to neighbours for help, because the fault on her telephone line and specially-fitted emergency alarm system had not been fixed.The now retired pottery worker has labelled BT's compensation offer 'an insult'.

Fault: Both Mrs Stokes' regular line and her emergency line failed to work, forcing her to crawl for help

She said: 'It is disgusting to be 
offered this amount. I was frightened when I couldn’t call for help, and
if it hadn’t been for my neighbours, I may well not be here today.

'I have lost my confidence and it will take a long time to build it back up.'

Mrs Stokes first complained to BT about a fault on March 9.

She fell the following night after 
tripping over a curtain as she tried to lock her back door, and managed 
to raise the alarm by crawling on her hands and knees into her back 
garden to bang on a neighbour’s fence.

The pensioner spent the night in the accident unit and returned home on March 11.

But two days later she was back in hospital after fracturing her hip and having to shout for help again.

The fault was finally fixed on March 16.

Her daughter Jean Cartlidge, aged 61, said: 'What my mother has been through is an absolute disgrace.

Upset: One of the letters BT sent to Mrs Stokes

'We rang BT on numerous occasions to tell them that the phone was off and that it left an elderly woman isolated in her house. How she survived this I don’t know.

'It was very cold on the night that she was found on her hands and knees, and BT is lucky I am not planning a funeral.

'Since she came out of hospital she is not the same and is very afraid to be on her own in the house.'

The Stokes family have lodged a formal complaint with BT.

The 96p compensation covers a loss of service on March 14 and 15, in line with the company’s policy of having three working days to first repair a fault.

As a goodwill gesture, BT has also offered two months’ free line rental worth £21.50.

A
BT spokesman said: 'We would like to apologise to Mrs Stokes for the 
fault on her line and are sorry we have been unable to come to an 
agreement on compensation.

'Mrs
Stokes clearly suffered a very upsetting fall and we are very sorry 
that this stressful time was further exacerbated by being unable to use 
her care alarm.

'The fault 
was fixed as quickly as possible. Unfortunately we cannot guarantee a 
fault-free service on any phone line, and this account was not 
registered with us as a care line, and therefore we had not recommended 
Mrs Stokes to join our priority service.

'We have since added this service to her account.'
