'You idiot': Former Tonight Show host Jay Leno criticized college students for being too 'politically correct' during an appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers on Thursday

He said: 'College kids now are so politically correct. I mean, to the point where — I'll give you an example, we had interns at the show, college interns.

'Like, the last year of the show, one of the interns comes and says, "Mr. Leno, I'm getting lunch. what do you want?' I said, 'I don't know, where are you going?' 

'He said, "we're getting Mexican." I said, "I don't really like Mexican." He goes, "whoa, that's kind of racist".'

Leno then shouts: 'That's not racist.'

'No, being anti-guacamole is not racist, okay? You have no idea what racism is. That's not racist, you idiot, you moron.' 

Carrying on the theme, Leno talked about how his grandfather.

'He only ate Italian food. It was always amazing to him that he would eat out of their ethnic groups,' the comedian said. 

'Like he would say, "Oh my God! A Chinese guy with a hot dog, look at that!''

They started talking about college when Meyers started talking about Leno's string of stand-up appearances. 

Leno, laughing, said: 'In the real world, people work every day. Only in showbiz do people go "Oh I've got to work next Thursday".'

Meyers then says back 'You only had to work an hour.'
