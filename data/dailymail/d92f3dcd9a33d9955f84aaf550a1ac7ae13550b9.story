Internet phenomenon Martha Payne, who counts Jamie Oliver, Raymond Blanc and
Scottish Education Secretary Mike Russell among her fans, has managed 
to raise £100,000 through her blog about her school dinners.

The nine-year-old schoolgirl first 
hit the headlines with her blog NeverSeconds about her measly school 
dinners but the real frenzy came after her council banned her from 
taking photos
of her food as media coverage allegedly left catering staff fearing for their jobs.

The controversial ban led to a flood 
of complaints, Martha trended on Twitter and Argyll and Bute Council was
inundated with angry calls and emails and eventually backtracked.

Although it only lasted 24 hours, the ban got enough worldwide attention to see
thousands of donations flooding in to Martha's JustGiving site, which 
she set up to raise money for Mary's Meals, a charity which runs school 
feeding projects in communities around the world.

Good cause: Martha's blog, Never Seconds, has raised more than £60,000 since she first started it

Donations to the 
page have now hit £100,000, which will see about 9,400 children receive a
daily meal.

Martha said:'This is totally awesome and will help so many hungry children.

'Mary's Meals is a very simple charity and it can achieve so much with so little as it costs just six pence to provide one meal.

'That meal can make a big difference.
I've been told children receiving Mary's Meals have to walk two hours 
to get to their school every day - I couldn't walk that far every day.

Martha has already raised enough 
money to build a kitchen shelter and feed an entire school for a year at
Lirangwe Primary School in Blantyre, Malawi, as part of Mary's Meals' 
Sponsor a School initiative.

Back for more: The council had tried to shut the blog down before a Twitter bakclash forced a U-turn

The nine-year-old is planning to 
celebrate the £100,000 milestone with a 'porridge party' re-creating 
likuni phala, the porridge-like dish which her money will help feed the children of Malawi.

The family is also planning to visit 
Malawi later in the year where they will visit Lirangwe Primary School 
and put the finishing touches on the sign for the school kitchen - named
"Friends of NeverSeconds" - that will be built by Mary's Meals.

Martha, who may also visit a class at
the school and do a few lessons, has already received a message of 
thanks from pupils at Lirangwe Primary.

In recognition of the schoolgirl and 
her supporters, they wrote: 'Thank you Martha and Friends' on their 
blackboard and sang songs.

Food for thought: Martha posted this picture on an internet blog and began to add daily snaps of her lunches, rating and commenting on them

Martha's miserable school dinners look set to spark an outcry over nutrition for the nation's children

Magnus MacFarlane-Barrow, founder and
chief executive of Mary's Meals, said he was humbled by the money 
raised through Martha's blog.

He said: 'This is incredible and I can't thank Martha and her supporters enough for everything they have done.

'As a result of their amazing 
beautiful acts of kindness, the lives of thousands of the world's 
poorest children will be transformed.

'Instead of being hungry and 
working for their next meal, these children receiving Mary's Meals will 
be sitting in a classroom with a full stomach, learning how to read and 
write.

'For every £10.70 donated, we are 
able to ensure another child will get a good daily meal for a whole 
school year and a brighter future.'

ONe of the young blogger's fans, celebrity chef Raymond Blanc added: 'The real triumph must be to have raised so much 
money for Mary's Meals, this charity which provides nutritious meals for
seriously deprived areas of the world.'

The charity success comes less
than a week after officials at Argyll and Bute council ordered teachers
to stop her from photographing her dinners and rating them online.

Victory! Martha Payne, 9, and her father David were all smiles after the council's decision to make a u-turn on banning her food blog

In a post headed ‘Goodbye,’ she wrote: ‘This morning in maths I got 
taken out of class by my head teacher and taken to her office.

‘I was told that I could not take any more photos of my school dinners.’

But the officials seriously underestimated the youngster’s internet 
following and thousands of people, led by celebrity chef Jamie Oliver, 
took to Twitter to criticise their decision, leading to a humiliating 
U-turn by the council.

Within hours of Oliver tweeting to Martha to ‘stay strong’ and urging 
his 2.3million followers to re-post his message, the schoolgirl’s blog 
became one of the top subjects discussed on the site worldwide.

Critics 
lined up to accuse the council of ‘bullying’ Martha by trying to 
‘silence her freedom of expression’ and thousands signed a petition to 
get them to overturn the ban.

And now Nairn has stepped in to offer
his support. His restaurant Braeval won a Michelin star in 1991, 
making him the youngest Scottish chef to win a star

He went on to cook a main course of 
Roe venison for Queen Elizabeth II and 250 guests at the Mansion House 
for her official 80th birthday celebration.

He will also be known to many as a regular chef on Ready Steady Cook.

The decision also angered Scottish Education Secretary Mike Russell, whose intervention forced the council to perform a U-turn.

Council leader Roddy McCuish announced they would be withdrawing the ban
with immediate effect. He said: ‘It’s a good thing to do, to change 
your mind, and I’ve certainly done that.’

Martha’s father, Dave Payne, 39, said common sense had 
prevailed. ‘Martha is beaming,’ he said. ‘She came home from school with
a big smile on her face.

‘She is delighted she can carry on blogging, but more so about the money
being raised for the charity. People have been very, very generous. The
way the world reacted to the ban is very revealing, it’s just fantastic
that common sense has prevailed.’

The saga began seven weeks ago when Martha, with permission from 
teachers at Lochgilphead Primary School, started taking pictures of her 
£2 school dinners and commenting on them as part of a writing project.

Because Martha’s home is on the west coast of Scotland, however, 
standards for school meals differ and widespread improvements in the 
rest of Britain appear not to have been applied.

Her first post included a photo of a measly slice of pizza and a lonely 
potato croquette, alongside a sprinkling of sweetcorn, a cupcake for 
dessert and a lot of empty space.

Alongside the photo, the schoolgirl wrote: ‘The pizza in the first pic 
was alright but I’d have enjoyed more than one croquette. I’m a growing 
kid and I need to concentrate all afternoon and I can’t do it on one 
croquette. Do any of you think you could?’

Internet hit: Martha's fearless exposé of daily fare at her (unnamed) school prompted global discussion about shockingly unhealthy food being served

Beside a photograph of a limp looking cheeseburger, two potato croquets,
a few rings of cucumber and a rocket ice lolly, Martha wrote: ‘Today’s 
meal was on the menu as Cheeseburger and ice cream/biscuit but as you 
can see I got an ice lolly. I prefer ice cream. I wish they had stuck to
the menu.’

Over the next two months her daily snaps gathered an impressive 
following, with more than two million people throughout the world 
logging on and sending in their own pictures for her site.

After seeing the photographs, Oliver, a veteran school food campaigner, 
sent a tweet to her father, which read: ‘Shocking but inspirational 
blog. Keep going. Big love from Jamie x.’

Martha later posted that the celebrity chef had sent her a copy of his 
Jamie’s Great Britain cookbook in which he wrote: ‘Dear Martha, great 
work!!! Clever girl. Lots of love. Jamie O. XXX Keep it up!!’

But last week, Martha, whose mother is a GP, revealed that teachers 
wanted her to stop taking the photographs. The council said the decision
was made after an article published in a tabloid newspaper, under the 
headline ‘Time to fire the dinner ladies’, left some members of staff at
the school in tears.

In an ill-judged 500-plus word statement, they accused Martha’s blog of 
being ‘misleading’ and attacked her father for refusing to put an end to
it.

Mr Payne, who runs a smallholding, correctly predicted the move was an 
‘own goal’ which would serve only to generate more criticism because 
‘the pictures tell the story about how good the food is’.
