As a solicitor and lay preacher, Anthony Weston believes in the rule of law and the word of God.

But neither could help him keep drug addict Matthew Kaye on the straight and narrow.

For, far from showing his gratitude after Dr Weston had represented him in court and provided him with charity and advice at home, Kaye instead chose to raid his office and plunder his silverware.

Burglar: Matthew Kaye, left, abused trust and kindness of solicitor and lay preacher Anthony Weston, right, by breaking into his home and stealing his silverware collection

The 30-year-old pleaded guilty to 
breaking into Dr Weston’s premises in Hereford and stealing silver 
objects including a pen holder, an ashtray and a paper knife.

Yet even after suffering such a 
flagrant abuse of his kindness, Dr Weston, who is in his seventies, 
shook Kaye’s hand as he left the dock.

Kaye had previously been given cash gifts by Dr Weston, who also took him to some of his church services.

Prosecutor Tim Hills told Gloucester 
Crown Court that Dr Weston had known Kaye since he was in his early 
teens, representing him.

‘He took him under his wing,’ said Mr Hills.

‘In addition to being a solicitor, Dr
Weston is a lay preacher working with a number of churches in 
Herefordshire and he used to take the defendant with him to services.

‘The defendant has been a guest in 
his home on a number of occasions, and over the years Dr Weston has 
helped him financially and with pastoral care.’

Mr Hills said that on October 1 last 
year Dr Weston and his wife Rosemary were upstairs in their home having 
lunch when Kaye called and asked for some money. Dr Weston gave him £5.

Later, Dr Weston discovered that the 
window of his office downstairs had been broken and the silverware 
stolen from his desk. He and his wife had to go out at that time, and 
when they returned Dr Weston found Kaye in the room.

Kaye claimed he had climbed in through the window to confront the ‘real’ burglar after seeing it broken.

But later forensic tests revealed that Kaye’s blood was on a piece of silver that had fallen under the desk during the raid.

Kaye’s fingerprints were the only ones found on the window and on a brick used to smash it.

When police arrested Kaye for the burglary he denied it, but confessed when he was due to stand trial.

Judge William Hart sentenced him to 
38 weeks’ jail, suspended for 12 months, and placed him under a 10pm to 
6am curfew for 12 weeks.

The judge told Kaye: ‘Anthony  Weston
has been kind to you over  the years. You let down a man who deserved 
only kindness in return for the kindness he showed to you.

‘I hope you feel ashamed of what you did. Repaying him in this way was sad indeed.’

Passing sentence, Judge Hart quoted 
from a victim impact statement made by Dr Weston in which he said how 
‘disappointed’ he would be if it turned out Kaye was the burglar.

‘He has been both client and friend for some years,’ Dr Weston stated.

‘I have tried to help him and have given him some money presents as  a friend.

‘I have taken him to various services
in Herefordshire. I have also had conversations with him about baptism 
and a marriage service for him and his girlfriend.’

The judge told Kaye: ‘Dr Weston is 
clearly not a man who puts material possessions at the top of his list 
of important things and he is obviously far more affected by the breach 
of trust represented by your behaviour.’
