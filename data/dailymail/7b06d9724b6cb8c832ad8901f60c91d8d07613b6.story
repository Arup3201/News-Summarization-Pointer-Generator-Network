As if alcohol wasn't already easy enough to come by, the U.S. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau has reportedly approved a new product called Palcohol, an alcoholic powder that comes in flavors including Cosmopolitan and Kamikaze.

Curiously, Palcohol's current website is light on details but the urge to 'drink responsibly' does not appear to be among the company's top priorities.

'Maybe you’re a college football fan. So many stadiums don’t even serve alcohol. What’s that about; watching football without drinking?! That’s almost criminal. Bring Palcohol in and enjoy the game.'

Get drunk fast: Powdered alcohol comes in seven different varieties and will be on sale by the fall

Palcohol...because liquid alcohol isn't always convenient. Since Palcohol is a powder, it makes it easy to enjoy a cocktail just about anywhere

Perhaps even more bizarrely, as well as adding the alcoholic power to water, the site also suggests that Palcohol can also be poured over food.

'Sprinkle Palcohol on almost any dish and give it an extra kick. Some of our favorites are the Kamikaze in guacamole, Rum on a BBQ sandwich, Cosmo on a salad and Vodka on eggs in the morning to start your day off right.'

There are even some rudimentary cooking instructions: 'Remember, you have to add Palcohol AFTER a dish is cooked as the alcohol will burn off if you cook with it... and that defeats the whole purpose.'

The TTB has approved seven versions of this powdered alcohol within the past few days.

The alcohol content is around the 60% range and the power can even be snorted.

The company wrote on its site: 'You’ll get drunk almost instantly because the alcohol will be absorbed so quickly in your nose.'

Party on! The company had stated that Palcohol would make it easier to consume alcohol where it is normally banned, such as at ball games

Palcohol will come in seven different flavors and it simply needs to be added to water in order for the boozing to begin.

A number of bloggers are treating the announcement with a healthy degree of skepticism.

'The person that pushed this through must be very patient or lucky and/or good. The product seems highly likely to raise a large number of legal issues and controversies,' writes Patent lawyer Daniel Christopherson on Bevlaw.com.

Patent applications are kept confidential by the government until they either issue as a patent or are published. Palcohol describes its product as 'Patent Pending,' which means that they have recently filed a patent application.

Start the day of right! Sprinkle a Kamikaze on your breakfast cereal

Perhaps recognising that such a marketing strategy risked causing controversy, and even possible legal issues, Palcohol has recently removed the original copy from its website and issued a clarification:

'We were caught off guard with the release of some of our labels by the TTB. As a result, people visited this website that we thought was under the radar because we had not made a formal announcement of Palcohol.

'Clearly, this site isn't finished. Thus, the verbiage that was copied was still in draft mode and the labels that were up were incorrect. So please disregard what is being printed as a result of information taken from this site.

'What we can say now is that we hope the product will be used in a responsible and legal manner. Being in compliance with all Federal and State laws is very important to us. Palcohol will only be sold through establishments that are licensed to sell liquor.'

Powdered alcohol is not a new concept. Such products are already being sold in other countries including Japan, Germany, and the Netherlands.

According to some, alcohol laws would in general only apply to liquids.

This would mean that powder-based alcoholic beverages could be sold to minors and that the powder would be exempt from alcohol tax and laws, as is the case with certain products in the Netherlands.
