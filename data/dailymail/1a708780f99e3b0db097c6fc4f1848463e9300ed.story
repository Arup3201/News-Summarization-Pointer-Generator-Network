Danielle Liddle, 22, was beaten with baseball bats and slashed in the face with a butcher's knife while she was giving birth

A pregnant woman was beaten with baseball bats and slashed in the face with a butcher's knife when a masked gang burst into her home while she was giving birth.

Danielle Liddle, 22, was about to leave for hospital when five masked men smashed their way into her house in Basildon, Essex, at around 8.30pm using crowbars.

She  suffered a 'serious head injury'  and may have a fractured skull  after the gang attacked her with crowbars and a knife  while her two-year-old child was asleep in bed.

Her partner Chris Miller, 33, who was upstairs collecting the hospital bag, came running  to protect her and said the young mother is now too traumatised to go back into the house.

The mother-of-two was rushed to Basildon Hospital and gave birth to a healthy baby boy on Tuesday despite her injuries.

Her partner, who suffered minor injuries in the attack, said: 'This was an extremely traumatic experience for us both. My girlfriend remains in hospital with a serious head injury when she should be celebrating the birth of our child.

'Please help the police to catch these men whose actions have tainted a period of time which should be a happy one for us.'

He told how he had gone upstairs to collect essentials for the hospital after his partner's contractions started coming every six minutes. 

'The next thing I heard a loud smash - like a fish tank shattering,' he said.

'Before we knew it we had five men in the house screaming 'give us your money'. They cornered my partner then hit her with a crowbar and bats and cut her across the face screaming and demanding more money. 

I just threw my arms round her to protect her. They carried on beating us. I was just shouting back at them, 'you are wrong man, she is in labour.

'Me and my girlfriend just started screaming and shouting for help.'

The men grabbed the couple's iPad, a Sony Experia mobile phone and £60 in cash  and then ran off.

Police are now hunting the five men, all ages in their twenties with local accents, who broke into the home in Beambridge, Pitsea, on Monday night.

Three of the men wore balaclavas and dark clothes, a fourth gang member was white and the fifth was mixed race.

Mr Miller said: 'I can't even describe to you how angry I am. My partner is too traumatised to even go back to our home. She is going to need counselling to help her get through this. To do this to a woman who is in labour - it's sick.'

Her sister said: 'They attacked her with crowbars, baseball bats and cut her face with a butchers knife. 

'She was screaming for them to stop as she was in labour but this did not stop them. Luckily my two-year-old nephew was asleep upstairs and slept through it. 

'My sister has had her face stitched but now discovered she may have a fractured skull.'

Detective Inspector Joel Henderson, from Basildon CID, said: 'This was a shocking attack on a young woman who was in labour. It is vital we get those people responsible off the streets of Basildon.'

Anyone with information can call Basildon CID on 101. 

A GoFundMe account has been set up my mother-of-two Joanne Ahrens, who is aiming to raise enough money so the young couple can rent a new house and install a good security system.
