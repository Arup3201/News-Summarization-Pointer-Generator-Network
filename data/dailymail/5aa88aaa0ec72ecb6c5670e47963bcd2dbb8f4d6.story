Jamie Carragher has revealed his all-time Premier League XI with fellow television pundit Gary Neville one of five Manchester United men getting the nod.

Sportsmail's columnist chose his favourite players from the Premier League era, but expressed regret that he was forced to choose  former Old Trafford rival  Neville at right-back.

The ex-Liverpool defender  opted for classics in his composite XI, including Thierry Henry and Ryan Giggs, and joked that he hopes Pablo Zabaleta can replace Neville in the near future.

'The right-back unfortunately has to be Gary Neville! Top player and professional. Could be challenged by Zabaleta over the next few years, fingers crossed!!' he wrote on Kicca.

Going through his selection one by one, Carragher added: 'My goalkeeper is obviously Peter Schmeichel. It would be very difficult for any keeper to ever surpass him.

'Left-back was a close decision between (Ashley) Cole, (Denis) Irwin and (Patrice) Evra, but I went for Cole as he's as good as anyone in the world in his prime.

'The best centre-back in the Premier League era for me is John Terry.'

As his other centre-back, Carragher opted for Arsenal icon Tony Adams, who he said 'to play next to him is my hardest decision'.

He continued: 'Roy Keane has to be in anyone's central midfield for his massive influence on Manchester United.

'The best player in the world right now will play on the right side in this team, Cristiano Ronaldo.

'Steven Gerrard will play alongside Keane. (Paul) Scholes and (Frank) Lampard close, but he has the edge. Ryan Giggs, the most decorated player and set records with games and trophies that will never be beaten, plays left wing. 

'Alan Shearer, leading goalscorer in the Premier League, was almost a goal a game at his best, leads the game. Thierry Henry, the best player we've seen in the Premier League, will play just off Shearer to the left where he was unplayable.'
