When police arrested 60-year-old Judy Lynn Hayman at her San Diego home last month they thought they had finally captured someone who had been on the run from the law since 1977.

But police have been left red-faced after it emerged that Hayman had been told by a California court in 1982 that she was a free woman.

Hayman had escaped from a prison in Ypsilanti 37 years ago after serving eight months of an 18-to-24-month sentence for stealing clothes from a Detroit store.

She legally changed her name to Jamie Lewis in 1983 and had been living in San Diego for several years.

She
 was arrested on February 4 after a Michigan Corrections Department 
officer who was stuck at his desk because of bad weather pulled her 
fingerprints and sent them to the FBI and other police agencies, thinking she was still wanted.

After
 the officer discovered the prints matched those of a woman living in 
San Diego under a different name, he sent an investigator to California 
and she was arrested.

However, Hayman’s defence attorney, Lisa Damiani, submitted documents showing Hayman's prison sentence was suspended in 1982 after she'd surrendered.

Deputy
 District Attorney Richard Madruga asked the judge to dismiss the 
fugitive charge after a Michigan judge confirmed that Hayman had indeed 
been sentenced to time served.

Neighbors
 at her apartment complex blocks at Balboa Park
 said she'd lived in the building for almost seven years.

Her next-door neighbor told The Associated Press after her arrest that Hayman was a ‘quiet loner but basically a nice person.’

Theresa Padilla said Hayman spent most of 
her time indoors, except when she walked her chihuahua, Monty, who was 
old and had to be put down less than a year ago.

Hayman
 had photos of three sons on her wall, and at least one of them visited 
often, taking out her trash and doing other chores, Ms Padilla said, 
adding: 'Her three boys seemed like they were raised well.'

Ms Padilla said Hayman didn't appear to be married or have a job. She said
 she and Hayman spoke infrequently but did share their experiences in 
battling cancer. Hayman also mentioned living in Detroit and being a fan
 of Michigan basketball teams.

One of her sons was visiting her when she was taken into custody, police said, and had no idea she was considered a fugitive.

The
 officer who found Hayman’s fingerprints, Lieutenant Charles Levens of 
the Michigan Corrections Department, explained earlier that many police agencies
 had fingerprints that matched hers, but under different names.

He gave the information to an investigator, Tim Hardville, who tracked her down in San Diego.

'I
 said, ‘Tim, you're going to get your girl here’,' Lieutenant Levens 
said. 'There are two ways to get off our list: a death certificate or a 
[live] body. It's what the state pays us to do. ... If you're a 
fugitive, you have an obligation to pay your debt to 
society.'
