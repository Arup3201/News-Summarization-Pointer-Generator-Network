LA boutique Kitson has called for a boycott of the Today show after a co-host told viewers not to shop there any longer.

The store came under fire in August for selling T-shirts emblazoned with the names of the prescription drugs Adderall, Vicodin and Xanax, merchandise which Tamron Hall called 'irresponsible' in a Today show segment, adding: 'People should probably not shop there until they get that out.'

In a post on the company Facebook, Kitson has accused Ms Hall of 'judging the merchandise without due diligence' and '[practicing] irresponsible journalism by voicing a negative, personal opinion regarding our business', asking that its customers 'seek an alternative' to the morning show.

War of words: LA boutique Kitson has called for a boycott of the Today show after co-host Tamron Hall told viewers not to shop there until they remove their 'irresponsible' line of prescription drug T-shirts (pictured)

Kitson went on to say that 'Tamron Hall should be removed from her position as an anchor on Today, as well as from her post on MSNBC before she damages others in an irresponsible manner.'

The shop's 'designer drugs collection' was designed by Brian Lichtenberg, the artist responsible for the trendy 
'Homiés South Central' apparel popular among celebrities like Cara 
Delevingne, Rihanna and Taylor Swift.

It features NFL-style jerseys with the names of drugs where an athlete's name would be, with the tagline: 'Pop one on and you'll feel better. Doctor's orders.'

The launch of the collection sparked fury among many customers and Twitter users - particularly among those who have witnessed first-hand the deadly consequences of prescription drug abuse.

In response to the negative reactions, 
the store released a statement defending the T-shirts as 'art' and a 
'parody of 'pop culture', which merely kicked off an even more heated 
debate online.

Kitson says the company requested an 
apology from NBC after Ms Hall got in on the debate, calling  the 
T-shirts 'terrible' and 'absolutely irresponsible'.

When there was no direct response, they wrote a boycott against the show, posting the manifesto in LA stores and even inserting it into customers' shopping bags, according to Page Six.

In the Facebook post explaining the situation, Kitson defended the collection. 'The T-shirts are simply a mirror of what is occurring in our culture,' it reads.

The company also claims that the clothes achieved their goal of opening up a dialogue about prescription drug use and the 'hypocrisy' of prescription drug commercials: 'The national attention that this line has garnered has brought forth a very healthy level of discussion.'

Negative reaction: Kitson appealed to its customers to defend the collection and call for a boycott of its offenders, but it appears the overwhelming majority have sided with the Today show

Kitson may have appealed to its 
customers to defend the collection, but it appears the overwhelming 
majority have sided with the Today show.

One commenter wrote on the Kitson Facebook page: 'You deserve whatever consequence comes your way from the irresponsible way you have mocked and glamorized prescription drug use.'

Another said: 'Yeah, you were really trying to spear head a discussion on pharma drug abuse. Sorry, not buying it. Just admit it was a stupid move on your part, and move on.'

After the initial controversy over the T-shirt collection this summer, Mr Lichtenberg issued a press release in which he claimed it was 'simply a commentary on what I see happening in our society'.

Justification: After the initial controversy over the T-shirt collection, designer Brian Lichtenberg issued a press release in which he claimed it was 'simply a commentary on what I see happening in our society'

'These tees are not meant to 
encourage prescription drug abuse,' reads the release. 'But if they open 
the door to a much needed dialogue. . . then mission accomplished.'

Not only did customers complain about the 'ignorant' collection, but three major drug manufacturers reportedly filed a lawsuit against the store for trademark infringement, since the items of clothing bore their brand names.

A representative from one of the producers of Adderall said: 'We had no involvement NOR do we approve of the sale of such a product using Adderall to glorify the misuse of our product.'

On guard: Despite the outcry, Kitson has continued to defend the collectiom, tweeting in response to criticism: 'Next time bully those directly responsible for the drug situation in America: Drug dealers. Not Kitson'

And a spokesperson from Abbott, the firm behind Vicodin, added: 'Prescription drug use should not be trivialized.

'It is a serious issue and we will be taking legal action to stop the clothing company from trying to sell such a product.'

Despite
the outcry, however, Kitson has continued to defend the collection, tweeting in response to one complaint: 'Next
time bully those directly responsible for the drug situation in 
America: Drug dealers. Not Kitson.'
