A homeowner fed up with a row over a fence his neighbour put up between their houses has renamed his home 'Ugly Fence House'.

Roy Bentley, 83, compared the 5ft high fence between the homes in South Wootton, Norfolk,with posts facing into his garden to something from Auschwitz.

The retired musician also claims his neighbours, John and Irene Laws, have encroached onto his land, prompting him to put the new name of his £270,000 house on his car port.

Roy Bentley renamed his home to Ugly Fence House after his neighbours put up a fence between their properties

The row follows a 30 year friendship between the two households and now police have issued him with a harassment notice. However, he and his wife Rita, 81, are refusing to back down and insisted he would keep fighting until he gets a 'neutral fence'.

He said: 'We have seen each others families grow up and have some wonderful memories.

'Then they built the fence in such an unreasonable manner and with very little negotiation and the arguments began.

'We don't even have pleasantries 
any more we simply shout over the fence - I have told them it it is 
hideous it looks like something out of Auschwitz.

'We don't spend a lot of time in the 
garden, I have a little vegetable plot but I am elderly and therefore we
just keep it tidy.

'Next door they have a beautiful garden which is funny really as they chose the most hideous fence. I keep asking them to remove the fence back to their property. It is really ugly.

'I have driven around the parish and 
you wouldn't find an uglier fence anywhere. The police have asked me to 
take down the signs. I am hoping not too.

'I am not sad that 30 years of friendship has come to this because they started it.'

The row follows a 30 year friendship between the two households.

Mr Bentley takes exception to the fact that wooden posts are on his side of the fence and claims the Laws next door encroached onto his land

The Laws first contacted police in May last year after claiming the he damaged their fence.

They said: 'It is a sad situation as we used to be friends and it is a shame it has come to this.'

In November army veteran Mr Bentley, who served in Palestine with the Second Batalion Middlesex Regiment in 1957, renamed his house 'Ugly Fence House' then added the second 'ugly' sign in February.

Last week he was issued with a warning notice by police, which outlines that his behaviour could be deemed as a harassment offence.

Mr and Mrs Laws said they installed the fence as part of a garden revamp after bamboo from Mr Bentley's garden lifted their concrete slabs by three inches.

Dave Marshall, a Superintendent at Kings Lynn police station, said: 'Neighbours in respect of the fence dispute have been spoken to by officers and one resident has been issued with a notice outlining the alleged behaviour is unacceptable and may constitute an offence under the harassment act.

'If there is a further course of conduct of this nature he may be liable for arrest and or prosecution.'
