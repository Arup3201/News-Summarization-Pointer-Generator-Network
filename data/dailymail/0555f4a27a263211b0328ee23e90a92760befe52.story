They don’t look like the typical criminal. The vast majority are women. Very few actually attend the court hearings to which they are summoned. Instead, a prosecutor simply races through scores of near-identical cases, repeating a well-rehearsed formula of allegations, pleas and excuses.

Often the magistrates fine the perpetrators in just a matter of seconds.

The crime? TV licence dodging.

Every week, in courts across England and Wales, almost 3,000 people are issued with fines of up to £1,000 for not having a TV licence. Unlike non-payment of a gas or electricity bill, failure to pay the £145.50 annual fee results in a criminal record.

The licence fee raises £3.72 billion a year for the BBC. It is illegal to watch or record live television without a licence

With more than 150,000 people convicted a year and courts being clogged (Culture Secretary Sajid Javid has said that 10 per cent of magistrates court cases concern TV licence dodgers), the Government has called for a review of whether non-payment should be classified as a crime.

Meanwhile, court staff are being forced to set aside entire days, once a week or every fortnight, to process such cases. And many city magistrates are too busy with more important crimes and are farming out TV licence cases to small regional courts.

The licence fee raises £3.72 billion a year for the BBC. It is illegal to watch or record live television using a TV, computer, tablet or even mobile phone if you are an adult under the age of 75 without a licence. While the offence normally results in a fine, it is not punishable by imprisonment. But you can be jailed for non-payment of a fine — with about 50 offenders a year being jailed.

The problem has become more pressing in recent years because fewer households have traditional TV sets as more people watch ‘catch-up’ TV on tablets, computers and smartphones. According to Ofcom, the telecommunications watchdog, 300,000 fewer homes had a television at the end of last year, compared to the previous year.

BACK in 2011, the BBC gave the business process management firm Capita an eight-year £560 million contract to administer the licence. The company employs 1,400 staff to chase non-payers — many on target-related bonuses.

I decided to spend a day at two typical courts — Warwickshire Justice Centre and Wigan Magistrates’ Court — to observe how our justice system is getting bogged down by countless TV licence-dodgers, most of them women. What is remarkable is how few of them attend hearings.

Magistrates listen to a representative from TV Licensing (technically a prosecutor) outline each case and then they take advice from a legal advisor. Otherwise, apart from the clerk and a court usher, the room is empty. It is a perfunctory affair.

In Wigan, 141 of the 187 convicted were women (75 per cent). Of the 171 Warwickshire cases, 134 were female (78 per cent) (picture posed by models)

Usually, non-payers have returned a form registering their guilty plea, adding details of their income and any mitigating circumstances to be considered in their absence.

During that one day in Wigan, £35,000 of fines (including costs) were issued to 187 people, only four of whom attended the court. The eldest was a disabled 69-year-old woman fined £195. The youngest was an 18-year-old unemployed woman fined £195 for not having a licence for one week.

The biggest fine, of £500, was for a woman convicted of the offence for a third time.

Of the four women who turned up, two were near tears as they explained how money-troubles had got on top of them. Four others had sent notes to plead not guilty, which meant that a trial date had to be set — at yet more public expense. In some cases, people who had failed to respond to letters about non-payment were convicted in their absence.

In Warwickshire, 171 cases were processed in a similarly methodical way. All had admitted guilt. Again, only four defendants turned up — in the hope of persuading, in person, the magistrates to issue a small fine by saying they were on a low income. In total, around £60,000 in fines, including court costs, were handed down.

In Wigan, 141 of the 187 convicted were women (75 per cent). Of the 171 Warwickshire cases, 134 were female (78 per cent). Those figures are reflected nationally. In 2013, a total of 122,686 women were prosecuted and 106,932 convicted. That compared with 55,099 men prosecuted, and 46,024 convicted.

This is in stark contrast to other crimes where men make up the vast majority of offenders. This begs the question: why are so many more women being caught without a TV licence than men? The BBC glibly says ‘convictions are a matter for the courts’.

And Capita, which takes cases to court on behalf of the BBC, says that when its staff go to the homes of people suspected of not having a licence, they take statements from ‘any responsible adult’ present — regardless of age or gender.

So, perhaps, the answer is that women are most likely to be at home when enforcement officers call. However, others think there is another explanation.

Michael Shakespeare, from Kent, who challenged the BBC in a test case over the need to pay for a licence, thinks that women are more easily intimidated. He says: ‘A single mother or woman pensioner who is on their own probably won’t stand up to the officers when they knock on the door. They probably don’t know their rights either.’

In his own battle with the BBC, Mr Shakespeare ensured that all his equipment at home could not receive a live TV signal and, instead, he watched catch-up TV through the internet, for which you do not need a TV licence.

Half of those jailed for the non-payment of licence fee fines are women, yet only 4 per cent of the country's prison population are female

Even so, he was summoned to court for non-payment of his TV licence. In a landmark case, a judge found he had no case to answer.

Andrew Bridgen, a Tory MP who is campaigning to make non-payment of the TV licence a civil offence, also believes that the BBC is ‘unnecessarily criminalising’ women. He says: ‘They will prosecute whoever is at home when they call, and sadly that tends to be women.’

He points to official figures that show that half of all those jailed for non-payment of fines imposed for not having a TV licence, are women, yet only 4 per cent of the prison population are female.

The MP says that, in some cases, women who have felt so intimidated by enforcement officers have bought a licence when they don’t even own a TV.

The BBC certainly pursues the licence with some vigour. Official figures show that, perhaps, it has done so with a bit too much alacrity. For it has been forced to pay more than £100,000 in compensation to 2,500 people wrongly pursued for not having licences.

One man who claims to have been a victim of such techniques is Peter Troy, from County Durham, who complained that licensing staff had been unnecessarily aggressive when demanding he buy a licence for an empty home that had been left to him after his mother had died.

He says he almost bought a TV licence ‘in panic’ because he was so worried. ‘I was shaken up by the brazen way they could bully people in their own homes,’ he says.

Despite his explanation that no one lived at the property, he said threats of a summons for non- payment continued. He was eventually awarded £250 compensation after saying he would, in turn, sue the BBC for harassment.

So, what do magistrates who have to deal with all these cases think?

Malcolm Richardson, deputy chairman of the Magistrates’ Association, says that his members say criminal proceedings for failure to pay the TV licence fee is ‘too severe’. ‘It doesn’t serve the interests of justice to lock someone up for not paying. Like non-payment of utility bills, they should be dealt with by the civil law. We would certainly welcome the law being changed.’

John O’Connell, director of Taxpayers’ Alliance, says it is ‘stupid’ that non-payment of a TV licence is a crime.

‘These unnecessary criminal proceedings clutter up the court system and cost taxpayers an extraordinary amount. Of course everybody should obey the law, but the punishment is totally disproportionate to the offence. As new technologies change the way we watch television, the TV licence in its current state is unsustainable in the long term.’

Even a TV licensing spokesperson says the organisation would ‘prefer not to prosecute’ and that the licence is ‘good value at 40p a day’.

He adds: ‘We know some struggle financially, which is why we offer a range of payments methods, including small weekly cash instalments and why we work with more than 400 national and local organisations to offer help and advice.

‘But it is only right that we take action against persistent non-payers on behalf of those who do pay.’

Back in the courts, those women I spoke to after their appearance were contrite for having not paid for their TV licence. But they certainly did not believe their behaviour was criminal.
