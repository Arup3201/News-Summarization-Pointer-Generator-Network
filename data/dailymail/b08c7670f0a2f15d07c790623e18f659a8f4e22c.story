Glamorous television reporter Julie Chang is learning to see again, weeks after her brain tumor was removed.

KTTV's 'Good Day LA' entertainment presenter was diagnosed in September when she underwent a CT scan following a surfing accident.

Now the show's hosts have assured fans that Chang, nicknamed 'One Eyed Willie' due to her vision troubles, is well on the way to recovery.

'One of the difficulties in her road to recovery has been her eyesight. It's improving everyday but it's definitely not 100%. But, trust me it's not holding her back! She's learned to roll with it,' 'Good Day LA' anchor Maria Sansone wrote for Fox 11.

'But, between her vision woes and the fact that I could go into labor at any moment, we were definitely happy to have Steve (Edwards) there (just in case)!

'She can't wait to get back to work and is eager to get the okay from the doctor to do so!

'I always knew Julie was a shining star but now I'm convinced she's a superhero! Her attitude in all of this is simply unbelievable. We can all take a page out of Julie's book and not take one single day for granted!'

Tumor: KTTV's 'Good Day LA' team announced during a show last month that entertainment reporter Julie Chang found the tumor when she underwent a CT scan after a surfing accident

Chang suffered a black eye about three months ago when her surfboard struck her in the face.

The
accident prompted a scan in which doctors spotted the tumor in the 
young woman's brain.

'LA, thank you,' she said. 'If it wasn't for my move to Southern California, I would've never taken up surfing, which in a way, may have saved my life.'

Chang, who underwent surgery in late November, shared updates on her condition on Instagram and Twitter, thanking her fans for their support.

'My @gdla family not a day goes by w\o 1 of you checking in on me. THANK U & love you. #roadToRecovery,' she wrote on December 5.

'Day 5 post brain surgery. Pretty weak in strength but high in sprits. Overwhelmed by all ur love (sic),' she posted on Twitter on November 25.

Chang relocated to LA about a year ago after four years at WNYW in New York City, where she was an entertainment reporter.

Previously, she was a general assignment reporter at WPIX.

Chang is originally from South Korea, but moved to Ann Arbor, Michigan, when she was nine-years-old. At the age of 15, her family returned to Korea, but Chang stayed in the United States.

She graduated from the University of Michigan with a B. A. in economics. Chang also attended Oxford University, in Oxford, England, before embarking on a career in journalism.

The reporter has been recognized for her work with a New York State Associated Press Award and a 2007 Emmy nomination.
