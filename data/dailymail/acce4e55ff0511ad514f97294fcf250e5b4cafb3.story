'I felt dehumanised': Valerie Trierweiler has attacked Francois Hollande in intimate memoir

French President Francois  Hollande has been humiliated by his former lover and first lady, who has portrayed him as a hypocrite who dislikes the poor.

Valerie Trierweiler attacks Socialist Mr Hollande in an intimate memoir.

The 49-year-old journalist describes the collapse of their nine-year affair after a  gossip magazine published pictures of Mr Hollande visiting his mistress on a moped.

And she reveals he sent her 29 texts in one day trying to win her back – while still seeing his lover, TV actress Julie Gayet.

The book, Thank You For This Moment, has sent shockwaves through France, where politicians’ private lives are not publicly aired.

Miss Trierweiler received an advance of some £70,000 for the first kiss-and-tell account of a serving head of state.

Extracts detailing the ‘cruelty’ of a ‘passionate, possessive and mad’ affair appeared yesterday in Paris Match magazine.

But the most damaging claim is that Mr Hollande is a snob who mocks the poor.

Miss Trierweiler, whose maiden name is Massonneau, recalls spending Christmas with her working-class family.

She writes that Mr Hollande quipped: ‘They’re not very nice, the Massonneau family.’

She says her family ‘is so typical of his electors’, adding: ‘He stood for election as a man who does not like the rich. In reality, the President does not like the poor. He, the man of the Left, calls them the toothless ones. He’s very proud of his humour.’

Mr Hollande sacked Miss Trierweiler as his first lady on January 25 in a short official statement.

But she says he had already lied brazenly to her about Miss Gayet, 42.

She claims to have confronted him when rumours spread in December 2013, saying: ‘“Swear to me on my son’s life that it’s false and we won’t talk about it any more”. He swears, and dismisses it as nonsense.’

When the truth emerged, she spent eight days in hospital for ‘stress’.

Disturbingly, she writes: ‘Julie Gayet was top of the  morning news. I’m cracking up, I can’t hear anything, I rush to the bathroom. I take the small plastic bag containing sleeping pills. Francois follows me. He tries to snatch the bag.

‘I run into the bedroom. The pills scatter on to the bed and floor. I manage to grab them. I swallow what I can. I want to sleep. I feel the storm about to break around me, and I don’t have the strength to resist.’

Bitter: Miss Trierweiler pictured with French President Francois Hollande, who she has portrayed as a hypocrite

After their split, Mr Hollande attempted to remain in contact, said Miss Trierweiler, on one day ‘sending me 29 text messages’.

Miss Trierweiler – known as the Rottweiler – claims that on August 12, his 60th birthday, when many were speculating he might marry Miss Gayet, Mr Hollande texted his former lover: ‘It is up to you to say yes to me’.

Elysee Palace sources said the President – nicknamed Flanby, for a brand of caramel pudding – had been ‘completely unaware of this book’.

Meanwhile Paris Match, where Miss Trierweiler works, describes it as ‘both a scream of love and a slow descent into hell, a dive into the intimacy of a couple. Two people and nothing else – Valerie and Francois.’

Over 12 
pages, it tells the story of Miss Trierweiler’s ‘passionate, possessive,
 mad love for this man whom I loved, who made me laugh, and who 
destabilised me deliciously’.

Miss 
Trierweiler says she felt ‘dehumanised’ throughout the Socialist 
politician’s rise to power because she was seen as his mistress, and 
talks of feeling ‘illegitimate’ when Mr Hollande won the presidency in 
2012.

Of the day he came to power, she writes: ‘He’s cold, he doesn’t smile. I’m his stooge, but I have no value.’

Thank
 You For The Moment, which comes out on Thursday, is said to be a no 
holds barred account of Valerie Trierweiler’s 18 months at the Elysee 
Palace. She's pictured here with Francois Hollande in May 2013

Ms
 Trierweiler, a 49-year-old Paris Match journalist, uses the glossy 
magazine to publish the first extracts of the book, which has a first 
print run of 200,000 copies

Over
 12 pages, Paris Match describes Ms Trierweiler's 'passionate, 
possessive, mad love for this man whom I loved, who made me laugh, and 
who destabilised me deliciously'

Elysee
 Palace sources today made it clear they had 'no pre-warning' about the 
book, with one saying: 'The president was completely unaware of this 
book'

The 320-page memoir is on sale in France from today following a massive 200,000 print run carried out in the strictest secrecy.

It is almost unprecedented. In 2013, Cecilia Attias, the second wife of former president Nicolas Sarkozy, cashed in with a book called A Desire for Truth.

However, it came out a year after he left office, and contained no intimate details.

Mr Hollande had a secret love affair with Julie Gayet, pictured here attending the Opening Ceremony and Birdman premiere during the 71st Venice Film Festival on August 27
