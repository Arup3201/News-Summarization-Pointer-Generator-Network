The mother-in-law of Google co-founder Sergey Brin obviously isn't ready for the company's futuristic dream of self-driving cars.

Esther Wojcicki appeared to have the fright of her life in one of the autonomous automobiles when she rode in one for the first time around a course specially set up in Long Beach, California.

'Turn it off!' she shrieked, as the vehicle accelerated to unsettling speeds around the course atop a multi-storey car park. 'That was crazy!'

Keeping it in the family: Mrs Wojcicki is the 
mother of Anne Brin, wife of Sergey Brin (right), who co-founded Google 
with Larry Page in 1998 - and is now thought to have a personal wealth of $20.3billion

Report card: A Google self-driving car is seen 
parked outside Google headquarters, one of a fleet that the company says
have undergone more than 300,000 miles of self-driving without an 
accident

The video of Mrs Wojcicki, mother of 
Mr Brin's wife Anne, was taken in 2011 as Google unveiled their 
driverless cars for the first time at a TED conference.

The
company's fleet of a dozen computer-controlled vehicles has since 
logged more than 300,000 miles of self-driving without an accident, 
according to Google.

Google's
autonomous cars use computers, sensors and other technology to operate 
independently, but a human driver can override the autopilot function 
and take control of the vehicle at any time.

And that's precisely what the driver 
of Mrs Wojcicki's car is forced to do as she starts to freak out during 
her first go in one of the vehicles.

No hands! These grabs show a Google driverless car as it swerves and steers around a course in Long Beach, California, carrying the company co-founder's mother-in-law Esther Wojcicki

car featured in the film had keyboards attached. It is not known 
whether the final products will also ship with keyboards

Her son-in-law has said that he believes the self-driving car 'can really improve the quality of life for everyone'.

Autonomous cars can make roads safer, free commuters from the drudgery of driving, reduce congestion and provide transport to people who can't drive themselves, such as the blind, disabled, elderly and intoxicated, he claimed.

'I expect that self-driving cars will be far safer than human-driven cars,' he added.

But Mr Brin's confidence had not infected Mrs Wojcicki by the time this video was shot. She is just one of three passengers aboard for the unsettling ride, which saw the modified Toyota Prius reach 40mph.

Cue much nervous laughter and obscene language as the vehicle hurtled around the sets of bollards set up to mark out the sun-soaked course - with its 'driver's' hands nowhere near the steering wheel.Â 

On the market within the decade: Google is just one of a range of manufacturers working on autonomous technology. They are collaborating with Toyota, but their competitors include Audi, BMW, Ford and Volvo

But, after gathering themselves, the three passengers experiencing what many believe is the future of road transport are eventually ready for more.

'Can we take another spin?' one asks. Another feebly reassures the rest: 'I've seen a video of other people doing it. We're going to be just fine.'

The nervous laughter reaches fever pitch this time as the car - with no outside interference - takes hairpin turns at speeds a real driver would be nervous to attempt.

Narrowly missing bollards and planters holding palm trees, it steers around the course to a chorus of expletives.

And when it finally finishes, the passengers respond with sighs of relief and an exclamation of the highest praise that can be awarded by California's geek set: 'That rocks.'
