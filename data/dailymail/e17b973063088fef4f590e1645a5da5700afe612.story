The Kenyan half-brother of President Obama has been sued by his girlfriend for allegedly kidnapping their son so he could take him to the United States.

George Obama, 30, allegedly snatched the three-year-old boy from his girlfriend's home in the Huruma slum, Nairobi on September 6 and still has not returned him, she told a court in the city.

She claims that Obama, who is one of the president's seven half-siblings on his father's side, plans to take the child to the U.S. where is mother lives and 'where education is free'.

But a judge banned has him from doing so and said he must bring the boy to court on October 31.

The unidentified 30-year-old girlfriend said she took the issue to the courts after she was unable to track down her son following his birthday party on Saturday, the Daily Nation reported.

Mr Obama, who does not live with his girlfriend, arrived at the house in a taxi and said he wanted to take the boy with him to buy a birthday present, the court heard.

She said the boy could only go if her mother and sister travelled with them, but as the women got into the taxi, Mr Obama threw them out, his girlfriend claimed.

He then drove off with the child, who has not been returned, she added.

A world away: George Obama has previously defended his slum home and said he does not mind that his brother has not supported him financially as 'he has his own family to take care of'

Her lawyer, John Chigiti, added that Mr Obama planned to take his son to the United States where his mother, Jael Otieno, lives in Atlanta.

'The defendant informed me that he wants to take the child to America to his mother where education is free,' the lawyer said, according to the Daily Nation.

How easy this journey would be is unclear; in 2010, George Obama's request for a tourist visa into U.S. was refused.

The girlfriend argued that the boy's travelling to the U.S would not be in his best interests.

It is not the first time George Obama has been in trouble with the law.

In 2009, he was arrested on suspicion
of possessing marijuana - a drug the president has also admitted to 
enjoying in his younger years.

George
Obama allegedly had one joint of the illegal substance on him when his 
home was raided, but the charges were later dropped.

He also made headlines this summer for appearing in the conservative film '2016: Obama’s America,' in which he refused to criticise his half-brother for failing to financially support him.

'I think he has a family of his own, he's supposed to help his family,' George said in the film.

'I'm part of his family, but I'm over-age so I can help myself. He’s got other issues to deal with. He’s taking care of the world, so he’s taking care of me.'

Although the amount his girlfriend is suing him for in court has not been specified, she is perhaps trying to get her hands on some of the $1,000 he received from the director after the interview.

Dinesh D'Souza told Fox News he had sent the money to cover hospital bills for Obama's child, who was in hospital for a chest infection, but it is a hefty amount in the country and far exceeds the cost of medical care in the area.

Barack Obama, who is 20 years older than his half brother, was born in Hawaii by a different mother, Ann Dunham, who was white with various European ancestry.

The two men share the same father, Barack Obama Sr., who died just six months after George was born, and the half brothers have met on just a couple of occasions.
