The mother of the Phoenix teenager shot dead by her school friend earlier this month is imploring parents to 'Hug your kids every day'.

At a fundraising event in Arizona on Sunday to pay for the funeral of 15-year-old Ana Greer, mom Diannah Dinsmoor said that spreading her message of love would serve as her tribute to her daughter.

'She always said mom we need more hugs and I'd say Ana honey of course we do we need more hugs; she was a big hugger,' said Dinsmoor about her teenage girl who was shot dead on March 7 by her friend, Matthew Bolton, 15, who then took his own life.

Emotional: Diannah Dinsmoor spent the day raising funds for her daughter Ana Greer's funeral which she wants to take place in her birth state of California

The Sandra Day O'Connor High School student was honored by her friends and Dinsmoor with bows designed in Ana's favorite colors - pink and black.

They were sold to help with the donations for her funeral in California in conjunction with the non-profit group Hands Across Anthem.

'In order to accommodate the family's wishes and taking her to California exceeded over thirteen thousand in expenses, and of course there's nobody that plans to lose their young loved ones like this at the age of fifteen,' said Steven Ragan with Hands Across Anthem to MyFoxPhoenix.

Anastasia Greer was shot dead by Matthew Bolton in the street outside her friend's home on Thursday, March 7.

But contrary to previous reports the two had not recently ended a relationship, and Ana was trying to protect Bolton's unnamed ex-girlfriend, with whom she was friends, when she was shot.

Ana's mother Diannah Dinsmor spoke out as it emerged Bolton had made a series of threats against his ex-girlfriend, and Ana had gone the unnamed girl's house to protect her.

When Bolton arrived at the home, Anastasia went out to confront him and was shot dead before he killed himself.

Police say Ana had reported Bolton to school administrators on the day she was shot dead, saying he had threatened to beat up his former girlfriend.

Officials at Sandra Day O'Connor High School contacted the parents of the girl Bolton is said to have threatened but because he was off school they were unable to speak to him.

 he had supposedly made

The following day, Ana and the girl, who used to date Bolton, returned to school and after class Ana met Bolton to confront him about the threats.

Police have said in the hours leading up to the shooting, one of Ana's friends had been so concerned for her safety that he gave her a small knife, and had asked Bolton if he was armed.

Bolton had said he didn't have a gun, but a few moments later the same friend saw him chasing Anastasia, before hearing gunshots and later seeing Bolton take his own life.

'We don't know what transpired when the two went outside as far as any type of discussion, other than to say a witness saw Matthew chasing Ana and heard gunshots,' Sergeant Tommy Thompson said.

'About that time the friend that lived in the residence came outside to discover Ana had been shot, he then witnessed Matthew shoot himself.'

Ana's mother however, has hit out at the school for not doing more to respond to reports of Bolton making threats.

'I trusted the school to do what they were supposed to do, that's what they were entrusted for. I put my daughter in their care for her to be safe,' she told My Fox Phoenix.

Dinsmoor also denied claims that her daughter had been romantically involved with Bolton, saying the pair hadn't spoken for months.

She admitted Bolton had bought her daughter a teddy bear last month, but said her daughter had not been allowed to date.

Police say the gun used to kill Ana was taken from Bolton's brother, who kept it locked in his bedroom.

Bolton is believed to have broken a window to get inside the room and get the gun.

Dinsmoor told AZ Central she found out her daughter had been killed after asking the girl's friends where she was.

After hearing about the shooting, Mrs Dinsmoor went to the house where Ana had been shot to look for her daughter.

'I was like, 'Iâ€™m looking for my daughter. Whereâ€™s Ana?' All their faces drop, and [they] point around the corner, and then I saw an officer ... I already knew what they were going to tell me,' she said.

Officers responded to a 911 call of a shooting around noon and found the two teenagers dead in the home's front yard from gunshot wounds.

A neighbor, Jim Friel, told The Arizona Republic that he heard a scream and then gunshots and went across the street to the home to see what happened.

He found the girl lying on the ground with gunshot wounds to her chest and the boy with a gunshot wound to his face.

Classmate Caleb Fleck told the station KPHO that Bolton, who was in his ROTC class, was well-behaved and was never known to be a troublemaker.

On his Facebook page, Matthew posted on Valentine's Day a photo of him and Ana smiling and holding a red 'I love you' teddy bear with a heart-shaped nose.
