A British woman has appeared in a photography exhibition celebrating the world's best facial hair after growing a beard for seven years. 

Harnaam Kaur is the only woman to appear in the collection of photographs after speaking out against critics of her appearance.

The 23-year-old from Slough, Berkshire, has been growing a beard since the age of 16 after being diagnosed with polycystic ovary syndrome, a condition which causes excess hair growth. 

Harnaam Kaur is the only woman who appears in the collection of photographs celebrating the 60 best beards in the world 

Miss Kaur is one of 60 people chosen to appear in the exhibition, Project 60.

'It’s incredible to be the only bearded woman among all these men. It makes me feel really strong,' she said. 

“And raising awareness for such a good cause is like a cherry on the top.

After being bullied as a teen, the teaching assistant tried waxing, shaving and bleaching to hide her facial hair. 

Once baptized Sikh, a religion which forbids cutting body hair, the 23-year-old decided to embrace her body as it was. 

'When I first started growing my beard it was for religious reasons but as the years have gone by I’ve kept it for more personal reasons.

'It makes me feel like a brave, confident woman who isn't afraid to break society’s norms,' she added. 

Project 60 marks the launch of Beard Season - a non-profit organisation seeking to raise awareness of skin cancer by urging people to grow facial hair through winter. 

Photographer, Brock Elbank, said: 'We’ve had a lot of interest from some truly amazing people and Harnaam is one of them. 

'To have her on board is such an exciting prospect for us.

'I like the fact that she has embraced having a beard and she’s very striking with it.

'She’s a really great girl and she told us her story and we loved her positivity.

Miss Kaur shaved, waxed and bleached her beard as a teen after being bullied by others but now says she is happy with her appearance after letting the beard grow for seven years

The 23-year-old has polycystic ovary syndrome which causes excess hair growth on the face and body 

PCOS is a common condition affecting a woman's ovaries, with three main features.

These are cysts developing in their ovaries, the ovaries not regularly releasing eggs, and high levels of male hormones - 'androgens'.

The syndrome is associated with irregular hormone levels in the body, including insulin.

There is no cure for the condition, but medicine is available to treat symptoms such as excessive hair growth and fertility problems.

Most women with the condition can get pregnant - but sometimes need a surgical procedure called laparoscopic ovarian drilling.

This involves destroying tissue in the ovaries making androgens including testosterone. 

'The whole project is about fighting melanoma and Harnaam is our secret weapon.

'For me it’s about diversity of character, not just beards. It’s about why they have it and the pride they carry by growing it.'

Australian Beard Season founder Scott Maggs said he hoped the exhibition would educate people about skin cancer.

He said: 'Four years ago I lost one of my best mates, Wes Bonny, to melanoma at the age of 26.

'At his wake a group of us decided to start something which would encourage more people to have regular skin checks.

'Not many blokes our age had beards back then and because his melanoma was on his neck we decided to cover up from the sun and let our beards grow, encouraging everyone who asked about them to have a skin check and share Wes’ story.

'Thousands of people have visited their GP or skin clinic because of what we’ve started, and every week I’ll receive messages from people who would not be here today were it not for our friendly advice.' 

Seventy-four-year-old Frank Moon, from Leamington Spa has been growing his beard from the age of 20, and is also featured in the exhibition

He added: 'Harnaam has such a magnificent message about the power of self confidence and positive body image.

'She has inspired millions around the world and it is a privilege to have her involved with Project60.'

Harnaam’s portrait, as well as the 59 others, will be displayed in London later in the year.
