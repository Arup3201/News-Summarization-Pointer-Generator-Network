Ian Holloway was clinging to his job after Millwall capitulated to League One Bradford City and missed the prize of a fourth-round trip to Chelsea.

Holloway, who has been in charge for just over a year, locked his players in the dressing-room at Valley Parade for an hour after witnessing an abject performance.

The defeat means Millwall have won only twice in the last 22 games, and their fans rounded on the 51-year-old manager by chanting: ‘You’re getting sacked in the morning’.

It came four days after Holloway’s side had sunk further into relegation danger at the foot of the Championship after losing to his old club Blackpool.

‘I said when I first took the job that it was going to be tough, but I didn’t expect it to be this tough,’ he admitted.

‘I’ve never seen a team capitulate as badly as that. I’m absolutely fuming because as a player I never gave a performance like that.

‘They didn’t look like a Millwall team or my team. They didn’t have any fight in them and that’s what we’ve just been talking about in there.

‘That was embarrassing. I didn’t know what they doing or where they were going. I don’t blame the fans after that. All I can do is apologise to them.’

The speculation over Holloway’s future came at the end of an eventful third-round replay that saw Mark Beevers sent off in the sixth minute, seven players booked and Bradford manager Phil Parkinson and his assistant Steve Parkin both sent to the stands by referee James Adcock following a brawl in the first half.

It erupted when Bradford striker James Hanson chased a ball to the touchline and was sent crashing into the advertising hoardings by a push from Alan Dunne.

Coaching staff intervened as both sets of players became embroiled in a nasty brawl in the first-half

Both sets of players and members of the coaching staff became embroiled in the melee, with Millwall goalkeeper David Forde particularly lucky to avoid being sent off after he appeared to aim punches at Jon Stead and Billy Knott.

Parkinson said: ‘I thought it was a dangerous challenge because there’s a wall just behind the advertising boards.

‘Me and Steve reacted. I was trying to make sure there was no brawl but it certainly wasn’t to instigate anything. The ref said it was for leaving the technical area.

‘You can get a yellow card for trying to injure an opposing player but me and Steve got sent to the stands, which is a bit harsh. I apologised to the boys at half-time because I asked them to keep their cool and stay on the pitch, and in the heat of the moment I reacted to a dangerous challenge.

‘We’ll have to take that on the chin and I’m glad it hasn’t ruined a great night.’

Bradford went three goals ahead before half-time after Beevers was shown a straight red card for dragging Hanson to the floor as he raced clear on to Rory McArdle’s through ball.

They took the lead two minutes later when McArdle headed Andy Halliday’s cross to the far post where Hanson was lurking to score from close range, and doubled their lead when Andrew Davies headed down a free-kick from former Chelsea and Millwall winger Filipe Morais for Stead, who had far too much time and space to fire home from 10 yards. 

Halliday then turned in a cross from Morais six minutes before half-time and Knott added a fourth in the second half to book a trip to Stamford Bridge that will be worth an estimated £500,000.

‘There was a big prize at stake,’ said Parkinson. ‘It’s quite a considerable amount when you consider our overall budget.’
