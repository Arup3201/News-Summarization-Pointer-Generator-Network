Michelle Obama and Ann Romney have both spoken out on the economy and unsurprisingly, the candidates' wives have dramatically different takes on our current climate.

The First Lady told a radio show on Friday: 'We are seeing right now that we are in the midst of a huge recovery. Right? Because of what this president has done.”

She said her husband had: “Pulled this economy from the brink of collapse when we were losing 800,000 jobs a month. Now were gaining… throughout most of his presidency, we’ve been adding jobs to this economy because of what he’s been doing. The stock market has doubled. Housing prices are rising. Foreclosure rates are lowering.'

Mrs Romney made her remarks on the nation's finances as she spoke to a crowd in Pennsylvania tonight. She said: 'My message is for women. Do you want a brighter economic future, if you do, vote for Mitt!'

Rally: Michelle Obama, campaigning in Cleveland today, told a radio show last week that the U.S. economy was in recovery, contrary to the latest statistics

Agenda: Ann Romney spoke to women in Pennsylvania telling them that if they wanted a brighter economic future they should vote for her husband Mitt

With just three weeks to go until the election, she urged Republicans to go out and campaign for her husband.

Michelle Obama took the stage at Cuyahoga Community College 
in downtown Cleveland, Ohio on Monday, telling supporters that they 
have power to determine who occupies the White House over the next four 
years.

She said that her husband's margin of
victory in 2008 came down to just 24 voters per precinct in the 
battleground and that Obama supporters should keep that in the back of 
their minds when they're trying to get others to vote.

The first lady told audiences in Cleveland and in the central Ohio town of Delaware that she cast her absentee ballot on Monday.

She urged them to do the same and spend Election Day getting others to the polls.

Last week, Mrs Obama told a 
hip-hop station in Washington D.C. that America 's economy was 'headed 
in the right direction' under her husband with more jobs and 
house prices rising.

Into battle: Ann Romney is greeted by Governor Tom Corbett on Monday as Michelle Obama rallies the Ohio gathering

Optimistic: Ann Romney speaks to a crowd at Elizabethtown College on Monday where she promised female voters a better economic outlook

However Mrs Obama's remarks appeared to be in direct conflict 
with a chart from the Senate Budget Committee last month - which 
revealed that for every person added to the labor force, ten left it.

AUDIO: Ann vs Michelle. The wives soundbite face-off... 

Between January 2009 and September 
2012, 827,000 people joined the work force in the U.S. During the same 
time period, 8,208,000 are no longer working.

The
data comes from a survey conducted by Republican staff at the federal 
Bureau of Labor Statistics who sampled 60,000 households.

The
'labor force' refers to those over the age of 16 who are employed or 
looking for work. It does not include those who have retired, on welfare
or have given up looking for a job. 'Not in the labor force' refers to 
the total population of the U.S.

Winning them over: Mrs Romney spoke to women who she promised a better deal under her husband Mitt's presidency

Reaching out: Mrs Obama was in Ohio as she urged voters to help others get to the polling stations come November 6

Vital statistics: The simple chart from the Senate Budget Committee last month shows ten times as many people leaving the labor force as were added
