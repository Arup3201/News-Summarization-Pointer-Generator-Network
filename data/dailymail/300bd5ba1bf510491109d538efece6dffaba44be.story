A mystery woman found in Ireland dazed and unable to communicate, who was later identified as an Australian with around 40 aliases, is on her way home.

Samantha Azzopardi, 25, described as vulnerable, had been in hospital in Dublin since concerns were raised that was she an Eastern European teenager who had been trafficked into the country.

But Irish police confirmed tonight that she was on her way back to Australia.

A spokesman for the force said this evening: 'In consultation with all of the relevant authorities, An Garda Siochana have facilitated Ms Samantha Azzopardi repatriation with a view to reuniting her with her family and the authorities in Australia.'

Identified: Irish police initially feared the 
girl was a victim of human trafficking but she is in fact a 25-year-old 
Australian woman who has apparent health problems

Earlier today it was announced that Irish police were considering charging Miss Azzopardi with wasting their time after it emerged the worldwide appeal for her identity cost has cost them £200,000.

Initially it was feared that she was a teenage victim of human traffickers but since her identity was revealed a more complex picture has emerged about her background.

Azzopardi, who it is believed had around 40 aliases, has been in the care of health authorities in Dublin as a psychiatric patient for last few days.

But today, the High Court in Dublin heard 
psychiatrist Brendan Kelly found she is not suffering from a disorder 
classed under the Mental Health Act in Ireland.

'She has a particular condition,' said Tim O'Leary, a lawyer for the Health Service Executive. 'That condition is specified and makes her vulnerable.'

Mr
 O'Leary said the woman is happy to stay where she is but supports are 
in place in adult psychiatric departments, including outside community 
placements.

The court was told yesterday that Azzopardi may be at risk if she is released from care.

Azzopardi had been in Ireland visiting a relative before going missing and being 
found on Dublin's O'Connell Street - the Irish capital's main shopping 
thoroughfare - in a distressed state on October 10.

Currently the huge police investigation into her case has involved 2,000 man hours and 115 separate lines of inquiry, cost Ireland an estimated £200,000.

Azzopardi was known to 'easily assume' the persona of an adolescent teenager, so was able to fool police into believing she was just 14 or 15 years old, the Irish Independent reported.

It was also claimed that Azzopardi was
 convicted in the Brisbane Magistrates Court in 2010 on two charges of 
making false representations, one charge of possession of a thing with 
intent to forge documents and one charge of contravening directions.

She was fined $500, to be paid if she reoffended in the following 12 months. Azzopardi
 was convicted the following month of four separate charges relating to 
false representations and given the same penalty.

It
 is understood she was last year convicted interstate for defrauding or 
deceiving to obtain welfare payments and sentenced to six months 
imprisonment, suspended for 12 months.

And in
 June last year she pleaded guilty in Perth Magistrates Court to three 
counts of opening an account with a cash dealer in a false name, one 
count of inducing a person to act and three counts of intent to defraud 
by deceit.

She was sentenced
 on October 2 last year to six months imprisonment, suspended for 12 
months. The revelations come as a complex picture emerges of her.

But despite such a track record a
 former boss described her as 'a lovely girl who had issues.'

Chris
 Nunes, the manager of a restaurant in southwest Sydney said she 
recognised Samantha Azzopardi's face on the television when Irish police
 released pictures of the 25-year-old as part of a global search to 
identify her.

Ms Nunes said she messaged her sister to say 'Oh my God, it's Sammy'.

'She used to work here for us. I saw (the photo of her) last night and then this morning I heard them say her name and I was like 'oh my god it is her',' Ms Nunes said.

Ms Azzopardi, who had relatives living in Sydney, was hired to work in the restaurant two years ago. She worked there for four or five months.

'I knew that she had some issues, that's why we let her go. She was a lovely girl. There was nothing I could say that she was a horrible person or anything, that's why I gave her the opportunity.

'When she left here she said she was going to travel overseas.'

Mystery: The girl, named Samantha, was found on O'Connell Street in Dublin (above) on October 10

Azzopardi's parents have been named as Bruce Azzopardi and Joanne Marie Campbell and she was said to have a brother named Gregory.

When her photograph was released 
worldwide this week, she was recognised by Joe Brennan who once was in a
 relationship with her mother and was living in Clonmel, Tipperary.

Mr Brennan contacted police and Azzopardi’s identity was quickly verified with Australian authorities, who stunned Irish police with details of her past.

A source close to the investigation told the Irish Independent that she had been 'fretful of any engagement with officialdom' after she was found, adding: 'There is no doubt she has been the victim of some traumatic event of some sort.'

Another source told the paper: 'She is very disturbed. 'It would appear there is something very serious going on here.'

The investigation was hindered by her apparent refusal to speak to police and the HSE - her only form of communication being to write short notes in English.

She also drew pictures of being brought to Ireland on a plane and of her lying on a bed with men, leading police to believe she was forced into prostitution.
