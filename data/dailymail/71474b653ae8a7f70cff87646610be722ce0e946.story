The fiancée of a father-of-two who drowned after being swept into water trying to rescue his dog has told of the moment she frantically tried to save her partner who could not swim.

Joanne Wardle and Alex Hardy were walking his pet on Hendon Beach in Sunderland when the 32-year-old fell on a slip way where his dog was chasing a pebble in September. 

A poor swimmer, the security guard was struggling in the water when Miss Wardle jumped in to try to save him. 

Joanne Wardle recalled the frantic moment she tried to save partner Alex Hardy as he drowned in the sea 

But she too was overpowered by the current and was unable to keep her partner from drowning. 

She said: 'There was this awful crack as his head hit the ground and for a few seconds he just lay there.

'Then another massive wave came crashing in and swept him in.' 

'When I saw he was in the water I didn't even have to think about what to do.

'I knew he couldn't swim but I am a strong swimmer. I just thought if I could get to him and get hold of him everything would be fine.

'But as I jumped in, the current took my legs away and I tumbled in the water, coming up near Alex. That’s when I knew it was really serious.

'I got to Alex, he was conscious but not responsive. I got hold of him but I know the fall had incapacitated him.

The couple were then separated again and the dog, Fudge, tried to reach his owner.  

'We then got separated again. I tried to hold on to him but the waves just separated us.

'It was then I had to fight for my own life. I was being battered about like a ragdoll.

The couple were walking Mr Hardy's dog on Hendon Beach in Sunderland (pictured) when he fell into the water 

'A fisherman was throwing a rope down to me tirelessly. He was shouting to me to time the waves. That really helped but I couldn’t reach it. I got very light-headed and shouted to the fisherman ‘I can’t do this.’

Ms Wardle, who had planned to marry Mr Hardy in 2016, was rescued by an RNLI crew shortly afterwards. 

Mr Hardy, however, could not be reached for hours. 

Michelle Taylor said she missed her son every day

At an inquest into his death, Ms Wardle described her late partner as 'the love of my life'. 

'Alex was such a loud, lovable character. From the moment we first met we just looked at each other and  knew we were going to be together. 

'He was so caring. He was my world, the love of my life.' 

Mr Hardy was an NHS security guard with two sons, aged 12 and 11, from a previous relationship.

Miss Wardle said: 'Fudge and I are the same, I don't think either of us can quite believe he has gone.

'Every time a car pulls up in the street his ears prick up.' 

Describing his death, coroner Vicky Ross said: 'He was swept into the sea. Alex wasn’t a swimmer. 

'Miss Wardle herself bravely went into the sea herself. Unfortunately Alex couldn’t be rescued.

Recording a verdict of accidental death by drowning, the coroner told Miss Wardle:  'You did everything you could to rescue him.'  

Later, his mother said drowning had been one of Mr Hardy's biggest fears.  

'His biggest fears of death were drowning or fire but it was the drowning that took him.' 

'He was a fun loving man who lived for his boys. He loved his family - it meant the world to him. 

'I miss him every day.'
