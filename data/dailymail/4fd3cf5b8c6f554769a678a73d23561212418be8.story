A new service is helping New Yorkers who are too busy or lazy to get their hands on trendy new products by hiring out people to wait in line for them.

Robert Samuel came up with the idea for his business, Same Ol Line Dudes, after selling two spots in line for the iPhone 5 launch and making an impressive $325.

These days, he and his team rake in $25 for the first hour they spend in line and $10 for each half-hour after that. 'It's a phenomenon,' he told Racked.com.

'I did an interview with German Public Radio a while ago and I explained FOMO: fear of missing out,' said the former AT&T employee.

'Especially
 [in] New York, you have friends and you're hanging out and it's like, 
"Did you see that new exhibit at MoMA?" "Do you know what a Cronut is?"'

Indeed, the Cronut is particularly hard to come by because only 200 are made per day, and there is always a line of at least 40 people outside before the Dominique Ansel bakery even opens its doors.

Mr Ansel recently had to crack down on scalpers who were buying Cronuts in bulk - which is against the two Cronut per customer limit - and selling them on Craigslist for up to $40 each.

But Mr Samuel sticks to the rules. 'I have two or three uber rich clients,' he reveals. 'One wants Cronuts a lot [for] whenever friends come to visit from out of town.'

So he gets to the bakery hours ahead of its 8am open time, armed with his usual tools for staying occupied: a portable charger, two iPhones, an iPad mini and hand warmers.

For the longer waits, like the launch of Isabel Marant for H&M, he brings a sleeping bag and even a tent.

'It just pops up, and people will look like, "Oh my God, it's that serious,"' he jokes, adding that a lawn chair, the Metro and HBOGo also come in handy.

The longest he's ever had to wait in line was a whopping 19 hours for the new iPhone 5. 'That was how the whole idea of line sitting came about,' he reveals.

At the time, he had just lost his job at AT&T and was thinking of inventive ways to supplement his income.

'Especially in New York, you have friends and it's like, 
"Did you see that new exhibit at MoMA?" "Do you know what a Cronut is?"'

'I live a few blocks from the Apple store on 14th Street, so I said, "Let me wait in line for somebody else and make them happy,"; he recalls.

A man gave him $100 to wait in line before cancelling his request, saying he would buy the phone online instead - but he let him keep the money.

So Mr Samuel sold his spot in line for another 
$100. Then he collected milk crates from his house and sold them for $5 
each to people who had been in line for hours and wanted a place to sit 
down.

Real deal: For longer waits, he brings a sleeping bag and a tent. 'People want these things like it¿s the end of the world,' he said (pictured: waiting for the first ever Marni Sample sale in November)

All in all, he made $325 that day and realized he may have stumbled upon a lucrative business.

Now, he has seven people working for him as professional waiters and 15 more who have expressed their interest.

'People want these things like it’s the end of the world,' he told the New York Post in November.

'When I show up to their offices with a sleeping bag in one hand and the Cronuts in another, they know they're getting their money's worth.'
