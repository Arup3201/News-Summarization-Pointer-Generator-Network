With only three days before the curtain is raised on the greatest show on earth, many people's favourites to win the World Cup, Argentina, are on their way to Brazil.

Paris Saint Germain striker Ezequiel Lavezzi chose the confines of their airplane aisle to post La Albiceleste's first Instagram group selfie - featuring star names such as Javier Mascherano, Angel Di Maria and Pablo Zabaleta - with the caption: 'Together for the same dream'.

Diminutive forwards Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero found space for a more intimate shot of the pair, posted on the Manchester City striker's Twitter with the more predictable message: 'With Leo, heading to Brazil!! Come on Argentina'

Aguero and Messi are also likely to be competing for the competition's Golden Boot award as arguably two of the most potent forwards in world football.

Messi has come under rare criticism for a relatively quiet season by his standards, but is hoping for a reversal of fortune with his country - while Aguero will be confident having claimed a second Premier League title with City, despite struggling with injuries.

Meanwhile, rival South Americans Uruguay were also showing off their travel photos with Southampton forward Gaston Ramirez posting a less cramped picture from their plane featuring Edinson Cavani, Christian Stuani, and Diego Godin.
