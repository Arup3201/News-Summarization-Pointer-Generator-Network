An entrepreneurial jewellery designer with a serious nose for business has come up with a way for devoted pet owners to keep their beloved animals close to them forever.

Lisa Morgan, 49, from Biggleswade in Bedfordshire, created a sideline operation within her main business of crafting jewellery out of babies' fingerprints: making precious silver keepsakes from the imprints of dog and cat noses.

Lisa dreamed up the idea for the pieces - which have been dubbed Snozzas - after her beloved dog, a Hungarian Puli named Poppy, died aged 14, and she had nothing but a grubby collar and tattered lead by which to remember her.

She decided to take a print of her new Puli Mabel's nose and cast it in silver, and see if the resulting mould might work as a necklace or charm bracelet.

And Lisa was amazed at the amount of detail captured in the result. The unique Snozzas were such a hit among her friends that she decided to go into business, charging £160 for a silver piece and £120 for a bronze.

She said: 'I had read that each dog's nose is 
unique, just like a human's fingerprint. It's the bit you have the most 
relationship with - it's rubbed up against your hand, it's shoved in 
your dinner and so on.'

(Pulis, in particular, are so hairy that on Mabel 'the only bit of her face you can see is her nose'.)

'I wanted to make sure I had something that would become a precious keepsake to always remind me of Mabel,' Lisa added.

'One day I took some soft putty we use
 to make imprints of babies' fingers and pressed it onto Mabel's nose. I
 cast the impression in silver and was astounded at the result. The 
detail was incredible.'

Lisa said people love to have keepsakes of their children but so often don't have anything to remind them of their pets.

She said: 'Taking an imprint is really simple and so quick the animal barely notices.

'So far we have just done dogs and cats but I was asked whether I could take an imprint of a hedgehog's nose!

'The end result is a really special and totally unique keepsake that is instantly recognisable to the owner.'

To buy a charm first send off for a £10 moulding kit which is then sent back to Lisa to make the piece. Lisa also offers paw print charms from £44. Visit her site here.
