So what's his secret? Well, he works out religiously for five days a week, honing his footie skills football for around four hours per day, runs for 25-30 minutes and does sprinting drills.

This isn't the first time we've seen his abs this week. Ronaldo stripped down to his boxers to accept former Manchester United team-mate Darren Fletcher's Ice Bucket Challenge nomination - and then called on musicians Jennifer Lopez, Beyonce and Lil Wayne to join in.
