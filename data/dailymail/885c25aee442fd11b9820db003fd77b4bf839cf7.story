'Master': Brian Thornhill, 59, of Godstone, 
Surrey, leader of the North Downs Pony Club, a fetish club, outside 
Guildford Crown Court today

The manager of a fetish club faced court today accused of flogging female slaves in front of a child and inviting the youngster to take part.

Brian Thornhill, 'Trainer' at the so-called North Downs Pony Club near Gillingham, Kent, admitted he enjoyed dressing in leather and using whips and torture implements.

But the 59-year-old denied engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child and other charges relating to possession of extreme pornography.

And he claimed that although visitors to the Pony Club - a venue where people dress up in equestrian-themed bondage gear - had taken part while almost completely naked, their activities were entirely non-sexual.

The jury at Guildford Crown Court heard when police raided Thornhill's home officers had discovered obscene videos and photographs involving people and a dog.

Prosecutor Simon Shannon told the jury: 'It is about his enthusiasm for bondage and bestiality and how he drew a boy into that lifestyle and into his practical fetish for keeping female slaves.'

He told the court that Thornhill was arrested after a social worker saw a photograph of him with a naked woman and a teenage boy by his side.

Thornhill was charged with engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child, including accusations that he performed corporal punishment on 'slave' women in front of the boy.

As well as the extreme pornographic photographs, officers searching his home and possessions found 43 video clips of a similar nature, said Mr Shannon.

They also discovered a video showing an act which was said to have resulted in, or been likely to result in, serious genital injury, the court heard.

Jurors also heard evidence from Thornhill's ex-wife, Sarah Baker, to whom he was married for ten years until 2002.

She described how their initially normal sex life had, at his instigation, gradually evolved over the years to include acts which involved inflicting pain on each other.

'I didn’t like it,' she said, 'I don’t like pain. He was very interested in hurting me but he was also interested in my hurting him.'

The 59-year-old is alleged to have flogged a female 'slave' in front of a 14-year-old boy and then invited the youngster to have a go. He is also accused of possession of extreme pornographic images and videos

Taking to the witness box himself, Thornhill said the activities he indulged in, in what he called 'the lifestyle,' were all about pleasure.

He said the advantage was that people 
could get a high and it was entirely legal and did not involve hanging 
about on street corners for class A drugs.

He also insisted that the activities at the Pony Club, despite participants being almost completely naked, were non-sexual.

'In the nearly seven years there I’ve never seen any sex,' he said.

'It’s pure escapism. They just lose themselves. They’re happy.'

The defendant denied that the boy had flogged one of the slave women, although Thornhill admitted he had taken her housecoat down and invited the 14-year-old to do so.

'There was nothing sexual behind it,' he said.

Charlotte Surley, for the defence, asked: 'What makes you say that?'

He replied: 'Because it was way outside of his remit. I personally don’t think he would have been sexually motivated towards that.

'To me and to him there was no difference to trying it out on the settee.'

Miss Surley asked: 'What would be the difference between a flogging that would be sexual and this scenario?'

The defendant answered: 'It would be between two consenting adults, setting out to enjoy a play scene with each other with the aim of pleasuring each other for the end result.'

He said there was 'no similarity whatsoever' between the two scenarios.

Thornhill, of South Godstone, Surrey, denies five counts of engaging in sexual activity in the presence of a child and six counts of possession of extreme pornographic images or videos.

The trial, before Judge Neil Stewart at Guildford Crown Court, continues.
