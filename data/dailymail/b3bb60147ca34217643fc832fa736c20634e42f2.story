A high school boy  has been arrested for strangling and stabbing his 16-year-old girlfriend to death, who was carrying his twin babies at the time.

Pregnant Arrijana Hill was found dead in her home last March on the 32000 block of East Cedar Hollow Drive in Pearland, Texas.

The suspect was arrested Tuesday afternoon at Pasadena Memorial High School on charges of capital murder, and has not been named as he was a juvenile at the time of the crime. He is being held at the Brazoria County Juvenile Detention Center.

Expecting: Arrihana Hill was found stabbed and strangled to death in her parent's upscale Pearland, Texas home last March. The father of her unborn twins was arrested Tuesday and charged with her murder

Paternity tests conducted on the two fetuses indicate that the suspect was the father.

While he was arrested at Pasadena Memorial High, the suspect and victim allegedly both attended Dawson High School.

It was Hill's mother that found her pregnant daughter's body the afternoon of March 21, at their home in The Lakes at Country Place - an upscale gated community.

Classmates: The suspect has not been named because he was a juvenile at the time of the crime. The suspect and Hill both attended Dawson High School, authorities say

Police have not released any other details on the crime, such as whether there was signs of a struggle or forced entry.

Before her death, Hill played volleyball and managed her school's track team. 

She was described as 'sweet' by those who knew her, and hundreds participated in a vigil held in Hill's honor four days after her body was found.
