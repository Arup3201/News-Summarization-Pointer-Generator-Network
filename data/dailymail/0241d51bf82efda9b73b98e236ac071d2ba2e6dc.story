Former N-Dubz star Dappy has had his trial for affray put back to the New Year so he can go on a £1m music tour.

His record label wanted a delay after investing in the series of concerts for his debut solo album, the court heard.

The star appeared wearing an Olympic-themed hoodie for his latest hearing into claims he was involved in a row over two girls.

The No Regrets singer, along with co-defendants Kieran Patrick Vassell, Kalonji David Stewart, and Alfred James Miller, were accused of brawling on a petrol station forecourt.

The quartet today denied they used or threatened unlawful violence towards another person causing them to fear for their safety.

It was alleged that 25-year-old Dappy - real name Dino Costas Contostavlos - had a clash with two girls he had just met after they refused to get into a car with his friends.

A confrontation ensued with a group of men and a fight allegedly broke out. It reportedly ended with three men suffering suspected facial injuries.

The incident - captured on CCTV cameras from various angles - was said to have happened at a Shell garage, in Woodbridge Road, Guildford, Surrey, at 3.30am on February 28.

Jimmy Vakil, defending Dappy, said today that the artist and his management would prefer it if the trial could begin early next year.

Dates of October 29 and December 10 were initially made available for the jury trial, but Mr Vakil sought a longer adjournment.

Dappy hides his face as he arrives at Guildford Crown Court today. He is the cousin of X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos, who was also in the band N-Dubz with him

'My client is in the music industry 
and he has a number of commitments,' Mr Vakil said during the plea and 
case management hearing at Guildford Crown Court.

'His debut (solo) album is out on 8th October and he is on tour from 28th November to 21st December.

'One
million pounds has been invested in him and the band (by the record 
company). The only way this oney can be made back is if it’s properly 
promoted.'

Mr Vakil said his client’s defence statement would be served by the end of today after several minor alterations.

When asked by Judge Christopher Critchlow what the defence position was, Mr Vakil said his client denied all the alleged acts.

All four defence counsel barristers, each representing a different defendant, asked prosecutor Wendy Cottee of the Crown Prosecution Service, for the CCTV images of the incident to be enhanced to improve the picture quality.

That police work was expected to take a number of weeks, the hearing was told.

Dappy from Royal College Street, Camden, North West London was formerly in trio N-Dubz with his X Factor judge cousin Tulisa Contostavlos and Richard ‘Fazer’ Rawson.

The tattooed performer was spotted wearing a grey hoodie with Pink Dolphin and the Olympic rings emblazoned on the back, dark trousers and trainers outside court today.

Once inside the building, the dark-haired musician took the sweatshirt off and appeared in the courtroom dock wearing a smart black suit and while shirt.

Judge Critchlow carefully considered the adjournment application, the hearing was told.

'I have to be fair to the other defendants and witnesses in this case,' he said.

He then decided on a New Year trial, which has been listed for between seven and 10 days.

Five defence witnesses will give evidence on behalf of Dappy, the hearing was told.

Addressed the defendants directly, the judge said: 'Your trial will be held on Monday 7th January. You are all on unconditional bail. There is no reason for you to remain in this court any longer. You can go.'

Dappy, along with Vassell, 25, of Hammersmith, London, Stewart, 31, of Harborne, Birmingham, Miller, 27, of Brentford, Middlesex, appeared relaxed as they left court
