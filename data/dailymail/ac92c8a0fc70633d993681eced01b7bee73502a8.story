Casey Bowen was two decades ago dubbed ‘Pocket Money Boy’ after he was handed £60 a week by social services to deter him from a life of crime.

Today came another nail in the coffin of that bizarre social experiment, as he admitted the latest in a long list of crimes.

Bowen, of Churchdown, Gloucestershire, pleaded guilty at Gloucester Crown Court to a distraction burglary at an 81-year-old man’s house.

The 33-year-old career criminal also admitted taking a car without consent and going equipped for burglary. Judge William Hart remanded Bowen in custody for a pre-sentence report. He will be sentenced on October 9

Bowen was at the centre of a national outcry in the mid-Nineties when it emerged that social services were paying him £60 a week ‘pocket money’ in an effort to stop him committing crimes.

They decided to give his family £60 a week to buy him the sorts of goods he was constantly stealing - like the latest in trainers and electronic games.

He had committed a series of offences and had escaped from childrens homes all over the country when social services took the bizarre and controversial decision to pay him the allowance.

The payments were revealed in the press and led to social services being condemned by politicians for paying what appeared to be a ‘reward for crime.’

Far from being steered away from the criminal lifestyle by his generous weekly allowance from the public purse Bowen went on to become a confirmed criminal in his home county.

He had not long been out of prison when he committed his latest offences. In 2009 he was sentenced to five and a half years for armed robbery of a McColl’s store in Cheltenham.

He hid his identity using a hood and balaclava when he burst into the store and hit a customer in the face to make him move out of the way.

He then went into the office where he forced two staff, Philip Clements and Jemma Giesdorf, to open the safe.

After stuffing the cash into a plastic container he made his getaway on a push bike.

Today Bowen pleaded guilty to burglary on 14th July this year of a pensioner’s house in St Paul’s Street North, Cheltenham,, and theft of china, glassware and a clock.

He also admitted taking a Rover 25 car on the same date and going equipped the next day with a pair of gloves.

His denial of a charge of attempted burglary at a house in Southam, near Cheltenham, was not proceeded with by the prosecution.

Bowen has previously absconded from children's homes all over the country, including the top-security Aycliffe home in County Durham where he got into trouble for assaulting staff.

In 1996 he got his second custodial sentence in two months for a 3am burglary at the Cheltenham home of a 100-year-old woman.

He stole her jewellery box and £40 and got just three months after his barrister pleaded with the judge: 'He is only just 16 and it is far too early to give up on this young man.' 

Aged 19, he was jailed for burgling the homes of two elderly women and was told by the judge: 'You have a dreadful record and nothing seems to have stopped you so far.

'Your own hardships are no excuse for burgling other people.' 

In May 2009, Bowen admitted threatening to kill police officers and their children after he stole alcohol and threatened staff at a Cheltenham supermarket.

He was jailed for a week for a similar offence the previous October.

In July 2005, he was jailed for a year for harassing a former girlfriend by bombarding her with 800 text messages.

Asking for an adjournment for a full pre-sentence report, Lloyd Jenkins, defending, said of his client today: 'He is now showing signs of maturity.

'He was hoping to be sentenced today but he is very keen to have a report from his probation officer who is on leave until 25th September.'
