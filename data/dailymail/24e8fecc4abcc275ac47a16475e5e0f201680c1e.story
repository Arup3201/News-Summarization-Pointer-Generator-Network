Christmas is now just three weeks away and many of us who are hosting will have our shopping list sorted and our recipes planned.

The smoked salmon blini - a fish starter on a bed of cream cheese topped with lemon - is a staple festive canapé.

A new variety of smoked salmon on the market hopes to take centre stage on British platters come December 25 - but at £25 for 250g, is it really worth it?

Quinlan's Irish Wild Smoked Salmon ranked highly - but at £25 per 250g, how much is the perfect bite worth?

Irish company Quinlan's Kerry Fish pride themselves on their  wild salmon, which is now one of the most expensive varieties on the British market.

The Quinlan family has specialised in hand curing fish since 1963. using traditional methods, natural ingredients, oak chippings and lots of manpower.

Founder Michael Quinlan developed a unique smoking technique and he and his three sons, Liam, Fintan and Ronan (who is the current Master-Smoker) are the only four people in the world to know the secret recipe.

The process involves salt, smoke, and brushing back the natural fish oils into the salmon during the smoking. 

This helps to give the unique taste and texture that Quinlan's, Kerry Fish has become famous for. 

Their smoked salmons scooped two prizes at this year's Great Taste Awards - the wild was one of them. 

Tesco Finest Hickory & Oak was a little too oaky, with an overpowering flavour

Wild salmon is a rare product because fishermen have to comply with EU pre-set quotas and the ultra-short window the wild salmon are in the appropriate area.

The family source it from nearby shores and the salmon is then prepared for hand smoking in the original family smokehouse.

They started shipping to the UK two weeks ago - just in time for Christmas - and promise to have your order to your door from Ireland within 24 hours. 

Prices for Quinlan's Irish Wild Smoked Salmon start from £12.50 for a small 125g portion - more than double the regular high street price for smoked salmon - through to £79 for a whole side.  

As a smoked salmon enthusiast I had no qualms about taste testing four varieties. 

The others were Marks & Spencer , Lidl and Tesco Finest. None were wild.

Quinlan's comes in at almost three times the price - £12.50 for 125g. 

My colleague made a little canape using each variety and I tried them all on camera. 

Fourth place: Lidl Laschinger Drycure Scottish, £2.66 per 200g

Lidl didn't impress compared to the others. It has crunchy little bits in it and the colour was pale.

However, it's fantastic that you can even get smoked salmon at this price, and it does taste okay.

Third place: Tesco Finest Hickory & Oak, £4.80

This smoked salmon from the Shetland Isles was a little too overpowering on the oak flavour, quite unusual.

A lovely smoked uniform colour though, so it would look good for a dinner presentation.

Second place: Marks & Spencer Lochmuir Oak & Applewood, £3.69 per 100g

M&S was actually a close second, and considering the price, it is incredibly good value. The texture was smooth and silky with little fat to cut through.

It's worth paying an extra few pounds to get your hands on this.

First place: Quinlan's wild, £12.50 for 125g or £25 for 250g

My favourite was actually Quinlan's. It tasted healthy, firm and lean, and it was succulent with a rich, deep flavour without being overpowering.

Makers say it tastes 'as natural as possible', nodding to the way the fish is caught - swimming through the Atlantic on its migration route as nature intended. 

It's almost 10 times the price of Lidl salmon per gram. But Quinlan's careful selection, curing and smoking processes, artisan skills, age-old recipes and fine fresh ingredients reflect in the superior taste. 

The high price mark up from farmed to wild smoked salmon is a product of the strict limit in fishing and difficulty in sourcing.

But why did it taste so much better? 

Regular smoked salmon - the farmed kind seen on most supermarket shelves - has a particularly high in fat content because the fish have usually been reared in small confined areas where they cannot swim freely and put on muscle weight. 

Wild smoked salmon, on the other hand, have naturally swum hundreds of miles through migration to spawning grounds and contain just a third of the fat of farmed version.

Don Staniford, director of the Global Alliance Against Industrial Aquaculture, has described the two types of smoked salmon - wild and 'flabby' farmed - as virtually two different foods. 

He said: 'The farmed salmon is a couch potato compared to the majestic and iconic wild salmon.' 

Smoked salmon recipes for a festive platter

Smoked salmon blinis and crème fraiche, by L'atelier des Chefs

Blinis with smoked salmon and chive crème fraiche

Ingredients

For the batter

225 g buckwheat flour

225 g plain flour

2 pinches fine salt

4 whole eggs

20 g dried baker's yeast

10 g caster sugar

600 ml semi-skimmed milk

30 g unsalted butter

15 ml sunflower oil

For the garnishes

5 whole slices of smoked salmon

100 g thick crème fraiche

Half a bunch of chives

3 pinches fine salt

3 turns ground black pepper

1.5 lemons

Method

For the blinis

Beat 2 of the eggs together. Separate the remaining 2 eggs and add the yolks to the 2 whole eggs. Reserve the 2 egg whites for later. Melt the butter.

Warm the milk to blood temperature. Cream the dried yeast with the sugar, pour on 100ml of the warmed milk and leave for 15 minutes to activate the yeast. The mixture should begin to froth.

Sift both flours and salt into a large bowl. Make a well in the centre and add beaten whole eggs and yolks and mix well.

Add all of the milk to the mixture and mix with a spoon or whisk until you have a smooth batter. Stir in the melted butter. Cover the bowl with cling film and leave in a warm place for 1 hour for the batter to prove. After 1 hour the batter will have almost doubled in size. Whisk the egg whites to soft peaks and then fold them into the batter.

To cook the blinis: Heat a frying pan over a medium heat and add a splash of sunflower oil. When the oil is hot, spoon in tablespoons of the mixture to create individual blinis. When bubbles appear on the uncooked side, turn the blini over and cook for a minute or so until both sides are golden brown. Continue this process until you have the required number of blinis or batter has finished.

For the topping

Chop the chives with a sharp knife. Cut the smoked salmon into strips. Cut the lemons into wedges.

Mix the chives into the crème fraiche and season with salt and pepper.

When the blinis are cooked, top each blini with a generous amount of crème fraiche, a slice of smoked salmon and a squeeze of lemon juice.

Chef's tip

Fresh yeast can also be used when making blinis. If using fresh yeast, double the quantity of the dried yeast in this recipe. Try using dill instead of chives to vary the flavour of your creme fraiche.
