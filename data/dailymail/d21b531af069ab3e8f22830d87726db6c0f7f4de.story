Now you can steal Pippa Middleton's style right down to her underwear as the brand of lingerie she wore to the royal wedding has been revealed.

According to Grazia Daily, the 29-year-old writer chose garments from Beautiful Bottoms London to wear under her Alexander McQueen bridesmaid dress as her sister the Duchess of Cambridge tied the knot with Prince William..

The British brand, founded in 2009, prides itself on its feminine styles and delicate fabrics and is on sale in Selfridges and other boutiques.

It was obviously an inspired choice on Pippa's part as it was at the April 2011 nuptials that she shot to fame dubbed 'Her Royal Hotness' thanks to how pert her derriere looked in the figure hugging dress.

She acknowledged in her book, Celebrate, that it had been a bizarre experience to suddenly become famous around the world thanks to her bottom.

She said: 'It is a bit startling to achieve global recognition before the age of 30 on account of your sister, your brother-in-law and your bottom. One day I might be able to make sense of this. In the meantime, I think it's fair to say that it has its upside and its downside.'

The upsides have undoubtedly included her money-making book deal as well as roles as a columnist for Vanity Fair and Waitrose magazine.

Her love life has also been on the up as she's been dating stockbroker Nico Jackson, 35, for months and he is rumoured to be planning to pop the question.

It seems new aunty Pippa has remained a loyal fan of Beautiful Bottoms since the royal wedding as she was recently pictured wearing their Wave Silk Wrap.

She teamed the print wrap with a purple leather jacket and black dress.

The company said they were 'thrilled' by her choice of scarf - which has since sold out on their website.
