The internet may have put the entire world within reach and extended the bounds of our knowledge.

But it seems we have little better to talk about than what’s on the telly.

Research into the nation’s viewing habits reveals that 40 per cent of all daytime tweets are about television shows.

It also suggests that audiences are changing how they view, because although they spend longer watching television, the number of sets has decreased.

Tweet-along favourite: The most watched live television event of 2012 was the Olympics Opening Ceremony in July

The TV Licensing study shows that 27 per cent of smartphone owners and 63 per cent of tablet owners use their devices to watch live television.

The TeleScope Report also reveals that the average household now has 1.83 television sets, down from an average of 2.3 sets in 2003.

But viewers are also watching more television. Last year, the nation watched an average of four hours and two minutes of television a day, up from three hours and 36 minutes a day in 2006.

Although 29 per cent of adults watch online catch-up services like BBC iPlayer, just one per cent of people only use these services and do not watch live television.

Nearly a third of internet users also watch television through catch-up services every week, but television ownership is still high, with 97 per cent of households owning a set.

Viewers are also upgrading. Smart television sales increased by 211per cent since 2010 and 2.9million Smart televisions have been sold in the UK since 2010.

They are also keen to upsize, with 
53per cent of television sales last year made of up of super-large or 
jumbo screens. In 2001, the figure was one per cent.

Sales
of jumbo screens (43inch or more) increased 10per cent in the past year
and sales of 3D televisions made up more than a third of the market 
total.

The Telescope 
report, a study of our viewing habits, suggests comedy is the genre that
brings most happiness to our lives, with 95 per cent putting it top of 
their list.

According to the report, the most watched live television events of 2012 was the Olympics opening ceremony, which was watched by 26.9million.

Catch-up services: Websites like BBC's iPlayer mean that audiences are able to watch more TV than ever

Other hits include England playing Italy in Euro 2012 which was watched by 20million and the Diamond Jubilee concert and Mo Farah winning the men’s 10,000m which were both watched by 17million.

But the report revealed that the average viewer watches around 1,460 hours of television a year, less than 0.05 per cent of the total hours transmitted.

Pipa Doubtfire, of TV Licensing, said: ‘Technology has given unprecedented freedom to create our own TV schedule, with the ability to record programmes to view at our time of choosing.

‘Services such as iPlayer, 4oD and YouView give us access to thousands of hours of missed television we can watch almost anywhere - on a TV screen in the living room from the comfort of an armchair, to a smartphone on a busy train or bus.

‘Although how, where and on what we’re watching continues to change, one thing has remained constant - our love of TV.’
