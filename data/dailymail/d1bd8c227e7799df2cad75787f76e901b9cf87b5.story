Apology: Staff at payday loans firm Wonga branded shadow home affairs minister Stella Creasy (pictured) 'mental' in an anonymous Twitter attack

Staff at controversial payday loans firm Wonga branded an MP campaigning against the company ‘mental’ in an anonymous Twitter attack.

Stella Creasy, a shadow home affairs minister, was also labelled ‘nuts’, ‘a raving self-publicist’ and a ‘self-serving egomaniac’ in posts from a now closed Twitter account traced back to the firm’s offices.

The online slurs were made after she accused Wonga of ‘legal loan sharking’ for offering short-term loans of up to £1,000 with a typical annual rate of interest of 4,214 per cent.

Company computers were also allegedly used to post anonymous comments on blogs critical of its practices and to delete criticism from its Wikipedia page.

Wonga accepted that a staff member had posted the offensive Tweets but stressed the comments were not authorised by them and appeared to have come from an ‘over-zealous’ employee.

The Twitter account was operated in the name of @DanielSargant1, but it was closed shortly after a newspaper journalist questioned Wonga about its provenance.

No one of that name is thought to work at the company, but an online comment on a blog using the same name was said to be made from an IP address – a unique set of numbers similar to a telephone number that computers use to communicate with one another – based at Wonga’s London offices.

We're sorry: Wonga apologised to Dr Creasy for the tweets which accused her of being a 'raving self-publicist'

The same IP address was used to edit the firm’s Wikipedia profile, it was reported.

'In this job, sometimes when people are out to get you, they really are out to get you. Wonga admits trolling me'

Dr
Creasy, the Labour MP for Walthamstow, said: ‘Wonga have been less than
positive about the arguments I’ve made about cost-capping [of 
short-term loans] and have been the most virulent and aggressive about 
defending the industry as a whole.’

Dr Creasy has been an outspoken critic of payday loan companies since being elected in 2010.

She has helped organise rallies, set up a website and lead pickets outside money lending shops as part of the protest.

Changes: David Cameron told MPs yesterday that the Office of Fair Trading would have new powers to suspend the credit licences of rogue payday loan firms to protect customers

After receiving an apology from the 
company, she tweeted: ‘In this job, sometimes when people are out to get
you, they really are out to get you. Wonga admits trolling me.’

However, Wonga maintains ‘an unauthorised junior employee’ is responsible for the attacks.

The total number of loans Wonga  agreed quadrupled to almost 2.5million in 2011 after it started accepting applications via a mobile phone app, pushing profits up from £12.4million to £45.8million.

The company insists it offers a valuable service by helping people access cash quickly until they are paid.

But critics have accused it of cashing in on the desperation caused by the soaring cost of living and pay freezes.

A Wonga spokesman said if they found the employee who posted the offensive comments they would face ‘serious disciplinary action.’

She added: ‘This is an issue that Wonga takes extremely seriously, as we are committed to openness and transparency. We are now carrying out a full investigation.’

She said Wonga regularly reviews its Wikipedia entry, but added: ‘We would not attempt to remove accurate material, even if negative.

‘To be clear, we do not condone any form of misleading or aggressive behaviour, on or offline.’

It came as David Cameron told MPs yesterday that the Office of Fair Trading would have new powers to suspend the credit licences of rogue payday loan firms to protect customers.
