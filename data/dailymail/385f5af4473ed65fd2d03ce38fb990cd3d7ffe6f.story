The wife of a television weatherman who was shot multiple times as he left the station on Wednesday has revealed his quick decision to drive off and flag down help saved his life.

Patrick Crawford, the morning weatherman for KCEN in Bruceville-Eddy near Waco, had climbed into his car around 9.15am on Wednesday when an unknown man approached and shot him.

Crawford managed to back up at high speed and drive out of the parking lot. He crossed the interstate and drove to a group of construction workers, who administered first aid and called 911.

As the search for the gunman enters day two, Crawford is recovering in hospital. Police told his wife, fellow meteorologist Heather Brinkmann, that his quick thinking saved him from worse injury.

'Doctors continue to tell me how well he's doing considering the multiple gunshot wounds,' she wrote on her Facebook page on Wednesday night.

'Police tell me that if it wasn't for his smarts to hurry up and drive off and flag down construction workers, it could have been a whole different story. He is truly my hero.'

She said her husband, whom she married last year, remains in stable condition. He was shot in the stomach and the shoulder, and a bullet grazed his head.

Brinkmann and other KCEN employees also uploaded Superman's 'S' emblem to their Facebook pages in a sign of support for Crawford. KCEN shared the image with the hashtag '#oursuperman' to its own page.

Police told the channel that they have few leads in the search for the gunman.

They are interviewing Crawford and working on a sketch of the suspect, they said on Thursday. 

On Wednesday, they surrounded a house and took someone they thought was a person of interest into custody, but it quickly emerged he was not related to the incident.

Police have said that Crawford and his shooter exchanged words as he left the station and the man then opened fire. The man continued firing as Crawford quickly backed up his car then crossed an intersection and crashed near a group of construction workers.

'He was entering the car when the exchange of gunfire, or the gunfire started,' Senior Trooper DL Wilson with Highway Patrol told KHOU. 'He did an excellent job getting in the car, speeding off and probably saved his life.'

He was taken to Scott and White Memorial Hospital in Temple and underwent surgery on Wednesday, and by the afternoon, friends reported that he was doing well. 

As he drove off, the suspect fled on foot.

'He is considered armed and dangerous at this time,' Wilson said. 'We're still going with a white male, 30 to 35, receding hairline, had a black hoodie and dark-colored pants.'    

Recovering: Crawford, who has been with the station for two years and married Brinkmann (right) last year, underwent surgery on Wednesday and is now in stable condition in hospital, she said

Speaking on Wednesday afternoon, Trooper Wilson said Crawford had not recognized his attacker. Authorities have still not said if the shooting was random and KCEN said it did not know if the gunman was connected to the station in any way.

Crawford, who grew up in Plano, Texas and earned his meteorology degree from Northern Illinois University, moved from New Orleans and joined the station in September 2012.

He  married Brinkmann, a fellow meteorologist and KCEN producer, last year.

The station's news director, Jim Hice, released a statement about the shooting on Wednesday.

'Early this morning KCEN-HD News received the devastating news that one of our own, Texas Today Meteorologist Patrick Crawford, had been shot in front of our building,' he said on KCEN.

'He is currently at Baylor Scott and White Hospital in Temple after undergoing surgery. He is in stable condition and resting.

'The shooter, as of this note, has not been caught. We do not know who the shooter was or if he is connected in any way to KCEN or its employees.'

He added that Brinkmann was by her husband's side in the hospital.

'He is a loved member of the KCEN family and our thoughts and prayers go out to him, Heather and their family,' he wrote.

On Wednesday morning, just hours before he was shot, Crawford showed off his winning Christmas sweater for the station's 'Ugly Sweater Contest' and shared images online of him raising a trophy.

The town is about 75 miles north of Austin.
