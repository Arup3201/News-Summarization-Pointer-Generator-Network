A banned driver who drove at 100mph during a Christmas day police chase, with his heavily pregnant girlfriend and a baby in the rear seats, has been jailed for 22 months.

Ashton Dellamonica, 21, from Stapleford, Nottingham, pleaded guilty at Nottingham Crown Court to charges of dangerous driving, driving while disqualified, and having no car insurance.Â 

The police chase was filmed by Nottinghamshire Police using both a police car and helicopter involved in the chase, and shows Dellamonica swerving around the roads, narrowly avoiding other drivers, running red lights and taking to the wrong side of the road during his 11 mile chase on icy roads.

Dellamonica, of Moorfield Court, Stapleford, Nottingham, sped away from an unmarked police patrol late on December 25 last year after being spotted driving a stolen Audi.

The offender later avoided a stinger operation that had been set up on the A610 with the intention of slowing him down, and then drove through Nottingham at speeds in excess of 100mph.

A police helicopter was able to follow the Audi as it passed through six red traffic lights before it crashed into a parked vehicle in The Meadows area.

At one point, Dellamonica speeds round a roundabout going the opposite direction, trying to lose line-of-sight with the police in order to escape

Frequently, Dellamonica swerves onto the wrong side of the road in an attempt to escape the police, keeping an average speed of around 80mph

At one point, Dellamonica travels into an enclosed estate in an attempt to dodge police

Officers then chased Dellamonica on foot and he was arrested after being found hidden underneath a parked car in Lammas Gardens.

His girlfriend, baby and another passenger were all uninjured.

Commenting on Dellamonica's actions, Detective Constable Emma Pollard, of Radford Road CID, said: 'Officers involved said they had not seen such dangerous driving in years of policing.

Dellamonica ditches the car in a cul-de-sac, jumping out of it while it is still moving and letting it career into parked cars while his pregnant girlfriend and baby are still in the passenger seats

He begins running through the estate, before attempting to get into somebody's house to hide

When he is unsuccessful he tries to hide underneath a car, where he is shortly arrested by the police

'Anyone seeing the footage of his driving will be shocked that no one was seriously hurt by such wilful and dangerous behaviour.

'Claiming he was concerned about a small amount of cannabis on his person, he chose to risk the life of his unborn child, his girlfriend, brother and baby, by driving at speeds of more than 100mph in icy and wet conditions.

'I am pleased with the sentencing and I hope it sends out a message that we will not tolerate this kind of behaviour in our communities.'
