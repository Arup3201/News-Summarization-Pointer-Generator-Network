Chelsea got back to winning ways in the Premier League thanks to strikes from Eden Hazard and Diego Costa.

Jose Mourinho's men also maintained their unbeaten record at Stamford Bridge as they ground out a scrappy win over a Hull outfit that were forced to play the last 30 minutes of the game with 10 men after Tom Huddlestone's dismissal for a knee-high lunge on Filipe Luis.

CHELSEA 

Petr Cech- 7  

Desperate to show he can still compete at the highest level and looked comfortable throughout the game in his first league start of the season.

Branislav Ivanovic- 7.5 

Never really tested and looked more dangerous with his bursting runs down the right hand side. Almost got his name on the scoresheet with a powerful shot which flew just over the bar.

Gary Cahill - 6 

Relieved to see Chris Foy only pull out a yellow card following his late challenge on Sone Aluko in the first half which the Hull players were furious with. Caused another stir early in the second half when he appeared to dive inside the box and was lucky to stay on the field.

John Terry - 8 

Always looked in control against Nikica Jelavic and showed once again why he is still one of the best defenders in the Premier League with another commanding display. Jose Mourinho will be praying he can stay fit to keep his side at the top of the table.

Filipe Luis - 7 

Fortunate to escape a serious injury following Huddlestone's nasty challenge in the second half which led to his dismissal. Never put a foot wrong and will be hoping to keep his place in the team.

Mikel - 7  

With Cesc Fabregas serving a suspension, Mikel had a chance to show Mourinho why he should be a first-team regular and forged a good partnership with Matic at the heart of the midfield.

Nemanja Matic - 8 

Has been one of Chelsea's best players this season and showed once again why he is so influential for the west London club with a powerful performance and broke up a lot of Hull's attacking play.

Willian - 7.5 

The Brazilian forward infuriated the Hull dugout when he dived following a challenge with Curtis Davies and received an immediate yellow card from Chris Foy. Was taken off midway through the second half.

Oscar - 8 

Showed his intelligence once again to pick out a wonder cross which fell perfectly for Hazard to open the scoring.

Eden Hazard - 9 

He might not be the tallest in the Chelsea team but the talented forward showed his aerial skills by planting the perfect header past Allan McGregor for the opening goal and produced a piece of magic to set up the second goal for Costa. Star performer for the home side.

Diego Costa - 8 

The Spanish forward ended his short goal drought after going four games without a goal with the crucial second. It was a shame that his performance was marred by a needless dive under a challenge from Tom Huddlestone which earned him a yellow card.

Subs: Schwarzer, Zouma, Ramires (for Mikel 82), Drogba (for Oscar 78), Schurrle (for Willian 80), Remy, Azpilicueta

Scorers: Hazard 7, Costa 68

Booked: Cahill, Willian, Costa

HULL CITY

Allan McGregor - 7 

Could do nothing to prevent goals from Hazard and Costa and always knew he was going to face a difficult afternoon against the league leaders.

James Chester - 6 

Lucky not to give away a penalty in the second half when his arm appeared to strike a cross from Willian but referee Chris Hoy failed to award a spot kick. Always had a major task on his hand trying to keep the Chelsea forwards at bay.

Michael Dawson - 6 

Nightmare return for Dawson to London who only lasted nine minutes after picking up an early injury and was replaced by Alex Bruce after just ten minutes.

Curtis Davies - 6  

The afternoon was always going to be more difficult when he lost his defensive partner Dawson so early in the game and failed to recover. Could do nothing to stop the Chelsea goals and did his best to keep the scoreline to just two goals.

Ahmed Elmohamady - 5  

Disappointing display from Elmohamady who failed to cause any kinds of problems for the Chelsea defence and was always restricted with his attacking play as he tried to keep the likes of Willian and Hazard at bay.

Jake Livermore - 6 

Blew a golden chance to get his side back into the game at the start of the second half when he drilled a low shot which flew inches past the post.

Tom Huddlestone - 4 

Did his team no favours when he was shown a red card in the second half for a high tackle on Filipe Luis. After being booked earlier in the game you wonder why he produced a studs up challenge on the Chelsea full-back.

David Meyler - 5 

Received a needless booking in the first half when he stuck out his arm to try and turn the ball home from a Hull corner even though the cross was past him. Had to be on his guard for the rest of the game which probably affected his performance.

Andrew Robertson - 6 

Frustrating afternoon for the Hull defender who did his best to keep Oscar at bay but found things even harder when his team were reduced to ten-men.

Nikica Jelavic - 5 

Steve Bruce would have been hoping to see Jelavic have more impact on the game but he failed to cause any problems at all for Terry and Cahill and was taken off in the second half. Needs to show a lot more in the coming weeks.

Sone Aluko - 5 

Just like Jelavic, Aluko did nothing to trouble the Chelsea defence and was also substituted. Must fear for his place in the starting line-up.

Nikica Jelavic (right) had a quiet afternoon and failed to cause Cahill (left) and John Terry any problems 

Subs: Jakupovic, Rosenior, Bruce (for Dawson 10), Hernandez, Brady (for Aluko 64), Ramirez (for Jelavic 74), Quinn 

Booked: Huddlestone, Meyler, Chester, Bruce

Sent Off: Huddlestone

Referee: Chris Foy
