The rolling countryside of Dorset beloved by poet and novelist Thomas Hardy will be 'devastated' if plans to build a dozen wind turbines there go ahead, angry residents have claimed.

The Thomas Hardy Society has condemned proposals to erect two wind farms close to locations the author wrote into his best-known works, saying they will blight the beautiful countryside that attracts crowds of tourists each year.

The proposed sites for the 400ft turbines are between the villages of Tolpuddle and Puddletown, close to where both The Return Of The Native and Far From The Madding Crowd were set, and at Charminster, not far from the tiny village of Stinsford where Hardy was born and where his heart is buried.

Residents in the west Dorset countryside celebrated by Thomas Hardy are fighting plans for two wind farms

Developers want to build five turbines between Puddletown and Tolpuddle, referred to by Hardy as Tolchurch, and a further seven in the village of Charminster, near Wolfeton House, a key setting in Hardy's short story The Lady Penelope.

Charminster is also down the road from Dorchester, where Hardy set The Mayor Of Casterbridge.

Thomas Hardy set his novels and poems in the Wessex countryside where two wind farms are planned

The Tolpuddle/Puddletown site is flanked by Waterston Manor, the inspiration for fictional Weatherbury Farm in Far from the Madding Crowd. A star-studded film adaptation of one of Hardy's most celebrated works is currently being shot and is due out next year.

Fans of the Victorian author fear the turbines will blight the heart of Hardy's Wessex and put tourists off visiting the landscape so intimately described by him.

Katherine Butler, owner of Waterston Manor, said: 'In Far From the Madding Crowd, Gabriel Oak walks across the countryside from Dorchester to Blandford right through the proposed sites.

'He would have had quite a shock if he had to walk past two wind farms.

'In fact, Hardy would probably be able to see these wind turbines from his final resting place at Stinsford.'

Tony Fincham, chairman of the Thomas 
Hardy Society, said: 'The sites are simply awful places to put these 
wind turbines. The locations are very much in the heart of Hardy 
Country.

Up to seven wind turbines are proposed for this site at Charminster, just outside Dorchester where Hardy worked

'It is a relatively unspoiled area of downland and the last place something like a wind farm should go.

'A lot of tourism in Dorset is thanks to Hardy, and if you destroy these landscapes there will be nothing left for people to see.

'People visit west Dorset because of the relatively unspoilt countryside and the fact that Hardy described it so intimately in his fiction and poetry.

'To just go and stick up these turbines at these location would be terrible.'

The plot of land for the Tolpuddle/Puddletown wind farm lies near Waterston Manor and is the setting of one of Hardy's best known short stories, The Three Strangers.

'Devastating': Katherine Thimbleby lives at Wolfeton House, which featured in Hardy's 1882 short story Lady Penelope

The turbines will be visible from much of Egdon Heath, which featured in the author's 1878 novel The Return of the Native.

Nigel Thimbleby lives at Wolfeton House, a Tudor manor house at Charminster which was home to the Drenghards in Hardy's 1889 short story Lady Penelope.

He said: 'These proposals are completely misplaced.  To put them here would completely spoil Hardy's beautiful countryside.

'Not only would it drive down the price of houses round here, but it would also have a huge effect on Dorset's number one industry - tourism.

'These turbines could be devastatingly damaging.'

The two wind farms are being planned by two separate energy firms, West Coast Energy, which is behind the Tolpuddle/Puddletown site, and Broadview Energy, which has drawn up the Charminster proposal.

The Charminster site is close to Dorchester, setting of Hardy's The Mayor Of Casterbridge - this still is from the television adaption starring Ciaran Hinds as Michael Henchard and Jodhi May as Elizabeth Jane

Tom Cosgrove, of Broadview Energy, said: 'It is inevitable that any wind farm will introduce change into an area.

'Certainly Thomas Hardy is an important figure in the history of our country but that does not necessarily mean you can't integrate new elements into the landscape.

'It is all about managing change in the right way.  It is widely known that we need new ways of generating electricity in this country, and onshore wind power is a fast, cheap way of doing that.'

West Coast Energy previously submitted plans for nine turbines to the local council but withdrew them last week while they went back to the drawing board following protests.

Steve Salt, from West Coast Energy, said: 'Following a review of the various statutory and other consultee responses and after discussions with West Dorset District Council, we have decided to withdraw the planning application.

'This will enable consideration to be given to the concerns raised and to thesubmission of a new revised scheme for the site.'
