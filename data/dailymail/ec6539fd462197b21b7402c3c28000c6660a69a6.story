The BBC came under fire today for a new sitcom which makes light of assisted suicide.

A new series starring Blake Harrison, of the Inbetweeners, tells the story of three young men who build a suicide machine and offer the 'service' to those who wish to end their lives.

But a prominent Tory MP expressed his disgust at the programme's premise, slamming it for turning suicide into a joke.

Mark Pritchard, MP for The Wrekin, told the Sunday Express: 'It is a sad fact that assisted dying is now regarded as a 'revenue stream' to some foreign clinics and clearly as a matter of fun by some parts of the BBC.'

The six-part black comedy, called Way To Go, was written by Bob Kushell, a veteran comedy producer who has contributed to The Simpsons and Third Rock From The Sun.

In one scene of the programme, due to air on BBC3 this month, the lever of the machine is pulled to deliver a fatal dose, killing Harrison's next door neighbour in seconds.

Another scene shows Harrison's friend telephoning him from a pub with a potential client. 'He's got stomach cancer. How fantastic is that?' he says.

Last year a Europe-wide poll showed that nearly three-quarters of British people are in favour of legalising assisted suicide.

The survey, carried out on behalf of the Swiss Medical Lawyers Association (SMLA), found large majorities in 12 western European countries supported the right of people to choose when and how they die.

Two-thirds to three-quarters of respondents said they could imagine opting for assisted suicide themselves if they suffered from an incurable illness, serious disability or uncontrollable pain.

In Britain, 71 per cent said they might seek assisted suicide while Greece was the most reluctant with 56 per cent saying they might do so.

The practice is now allowed in only four countries on the continent, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland.

The German government has proposed legalising the practice as long as no profit is involved - while France is also debating whether to allow it.

But whether people are ready to see television comedians making light of the subject is yet to be seen.

Defending the forthcoming comedy, BBC3 controller Zai Bennett told the Sunday Express: 'Bob Kushell's scripts are in turn dark, poignant, absurd, moving and brilliant.

'I'm thrilled that Way To Go is coming to BBC3.'
