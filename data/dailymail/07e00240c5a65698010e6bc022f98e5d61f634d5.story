The cost of a semi-final ticket will also rise marginally. Supporters will pay £3 more this season and tickets will then go up by another £2 the following year.

The cheapest semi-final ticket this year will cost £33, with the most expensive one priced at £63.

The FA said all participating clubs are able to apply a further discretionary £10 concession on relevant tickets.

FA general secretary Alex Horne said: 'We have held prices for four seasons for these showpiece events and we have been conscious to stagger the rise over two years.

'We appreciate the commitment supporters show in following their teams to Wembley Stadium and we have ensured the semi-finals and final remain competitively priced in line with top tier football and other similar major UK sporting events.'
