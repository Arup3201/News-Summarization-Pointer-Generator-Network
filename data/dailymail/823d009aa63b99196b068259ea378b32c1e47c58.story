A luxury Atlanta hotel is searching for a homeless man who returned a hotel guest's wallet he found in a trash can two weeks ago. 

Keen to repay the kindness, Omni Hotel at CNN Center is offering John Crabber a $500 reward, a Thanksgiving meal and an overnight stay.

But the hotel - which only has Crabber's name and a blurry surveillance picture - can't find him.

Reward: Omni Hotel at CNN Center is offering this man, who said his name was John Crabber, a $500 reward, Thanksgiving dinner and an overnight stay for his kindness

'He did the right thing, and now I 
want to do the right thing for this guy,' hotel managing director Scott Stuckey told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Crabber was rifling through the trash searching for food on November 7 when he found a wallet containing credit cards and a French woman's identification.

The scruffy-faced man took the wallet to two hotels searching for the owner: first to Glenn Hotel on Spring St, then to
Omni Hotel, where the woman was staying.

The wallet’s owner, Anne Drouart of 
France, was in Georgia for a nephrology convention when her handbag was stolen.

Kind: Omi Hotel managing director Scott Stuckey wants to offer the homeless man a reward

According to a police 
report obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Drouart, 45, claimed someone pushed her 
and took her bag as she walked to her car on November 7.

But she got her wallet and cards back thanks to Crabber's kindness.

Stuckey released the surveillance image of Crabber handing in the wallet to the hotel's security desk in a bid to locate him.

'When you're looking through food in the garbage can, it's probably one of the toughest times of his life,' Stuckey told WSBTV.

'But when you find somebody's wallet and you do the right thing, I think we'd like to do the right thing by this person.

'Every person has a story and this person obviously has a story and did 
the right thing by bringing it to try to find the person.'

According to the hotel's website, a four-course Thanksgiving lunch costs $28 while rooms (offering bed and breakfast) start at about $119.

Anyone who sees Crabber has been asked to contact the hotel.
