It's the latest member of the Coca-Cola family designed to ease the consumer conscience.

Called Coca-Cola Life, it's marketed as having less sugar than regular Coke but none of those artificial sweeteners that increasingly plague Diet Coke drinkers.

The new naturally sweetened drink - which contains a third less sugar and calories than regular cola - has been created amid calls for the company to do more to tackle the global obesity epidemic.

Sold in a green can or a recyclable bottle, it is already available in the UK, U.S., Chile, Argentina and is due to hit Australian shelves in April.

But critics say the product - marketed as ‘healthy’ - may do more to improve the company’s finances than the health of its consumers.

Coke Life only contains 290 calories compared to the Classic Coke can which has 450 calories - but critics have voiced concerns about it being marketed as 'healthy' 

Coke Life is sweetened with a blend of sugar and stevia leaf extract - a calorie-free sweetener which is 200- 300 times sweeter than table sugar.

A plant used for centuries by Paraguay's Guarani Indians, it has shot from relative obscurity to being used as a key sweetener by large companies such as Coca-Cola and Danone in just a few years.

Currently, Coca-Cola Great Britain uses stevia leaf extract as a sweetener in its Sprite and Glaceau vitamin water brands, though critics have complained it has a 'bitter aftertaste', similar to liquorice.

A 330ml can of Coke Life contains 89 calories, compared to 139 calories in a regular can of Coca- Cola.

Coca-Cola’s other products, Coke Zero and Diet Coke - sweetened with the artificial sweetener aspartame - contain around one calorie each.

But the company is facing a growing backlash against such artificial sweeteners such as aspartame and an increased demand for natural products.

The solution? Bring out Coke Life for the slightly more health conscious consumers out there known as 'balance-seekers'.

Coke’s UK marketing director, Bobby Brittain, has said: ‘We know exactly who our Coke Life will appeal to.

‘It’s 20 and 30-somethings who have begun to realise they’re not completely immortal and that they do have a sense of responsibility about what they consume.’

Some health experts are sceptical about Coca-Cola’s motives and worry about the health implications of a fizzy drink marketed in ‘healthy’ green packaging.

Writing for The Conversation, Professor Sandra Jones, director of the Centre for Health and Social Research at Australian Catholic University, said: ‘While stevia is safe to consume, nutritionists have noted that simply removing some sugar and replacing it with stevia doesn’t make a drink (or food) healthy.

Coke Life has 89 calories per 330ml can and 22g of sugar. This is more sugar than Diet Coke and Coke Zero but less than 'full-fat' regular Coke

'Full-fat' Coke contains 139 calories a can, and 35g of sugar, the equivalent of seven cubes

Diet Coke - which is sweetened with controversial sweetener aspartame contains just one calorie

Coke Zero is similarly calorie-free and is made with the same sweeteners as Diet Coke, but has a different flavour base

‘Coca-Cola Life still contains colouring, caffeine, phosphoric acid and 19 per cent of our recommended daily sugar intake.’

‘In fact, a cola drink with a few less calories may be part of the problem rather than the answer to reducing our waistlines. People tend to consume greater quantities of foods they believe to be healthy, and seeing a food promoted as healthy can lead people to eat more calories.’

The colour green is associated with healthiness, and so there may be a subtle reason why Coca- Cola decided to stray away from its iconic red-labelling with this product.

Professor Jones said: ‘A recent European study found people drink less soft drink from a red-labelled cup than a blue-labelled cup. At a subconscious level, the colour red operates as a stop signal.’

When it was launched, Coca-Cola said that the new drink was part of its commitments to offer consumers reduced, low and no-calorie options – adding that it was the ‘most recent example in a series of initiatives by the company to inspire happier, healthier lives’.

The company is a signatory to the Government’s Responsibility Deal, under which the food and drink industry has pledged to promote and healthier diet and make changes to their products.

Coca-Cola Life is made from a mixture of sugar and a sweetener made from an extract of Stevia leaf, a plant used for centuries by Paraguay's Guarani Indians

Coca-Cola has committed to reduce the average calories per litre in its range of sparkling drinks by 5 per cent by the end of 2014.

But Professor Jones is sceptical about whether introducing Coke Life is consistent with the promise to promote healthier lifestyles.

She said: ‘Ultimately, many of these decisions are likely being made to increase the health of the companies' profits rather than the health of their customers.’

A look at The Coca Cola Company’s 2013 financial results shows profits from regular soft drinks are declining and sales of “healthier” options are increasing, she added.

She continued: ‘Perhaps the most genuine option for this and other such companies would be to cut back on the production and marketing of sweetened soft drinks and focus on selling products that are actually good for consumers.
