A television advert for E45 cream – featuring a young woman talking about her addiction problems – has been accused of trivialising drug abuse.

Sixty viewers have complained to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) about the ‘offensive’ campaign for the popular moisturiser – which parodies an interview with a drug addict.

The advert features a thin, pale-looking woman sitting on a chair in a darkened basement rubbing her arms anxiously.

Bad taste: The new E45 advert has been pulled after getting complaints as it parodied drug addiction, as the girl confesses that she is 'hooked' on it

At the beginning of the 40-second commercial she says: ‘It all started with a small dose. All my friends were using it. I immediately liked it and wanted more.

‘It became a routine. It affected how I looked and how I felt. I couldn’t stop thinking about it.’ The advert plugs the moisturiser which has been praised by former X Factor star Cheryl Cole.

In the last seconds of the film the model, who appears to be struggling with her addiction, then livens up and begins talking about the product – which is the biggest-selling of its kind in Britain.

She is shown applying it to her arms, before saying: ‘It was the perfect daily moisturiser. It’s so light and smells great .  .  . I was hooked.’ The last shot shows samples of the cream, which retails for about £5.49, and the slogan: ‘You’ll be hooked.’

Trivial: Viewers complained about the advert as being 'offensive' to people struggling with addiction

Last night, critics branded the campaign ‘offensive’.

Ken Stringer, chief executive of the charity Alliance, which is a support group for addicts, said: ‘It certainly trivialises the issue of addiction and people who are struggling to overcome their addiction. It is exploitative because it relies heavily on a stereotype of people in recovery.’

Vivienne Pattison, director of the viewers’ campaign group Mediwatch-UK, said: ‘I can imagine people might find it offensive.’

Bestseller: E45 body lotion is a market leader

TV viewers also complained on Twitter and Facebook. One tweeted: ‘What completely misjudged, misguided ad content from E45 cream.’

Another added: ‘Comparing moisturising lotion to serious drug addiction? Big NO.’

An ASA spokesman confirmed 60 complaints had been received. He said: ‘We will look at the advert to see if there appear to be problems under the advertising code.’

Reckitt Benckiser, the British company that manufactures the cream, was last night unavailable for comment.
