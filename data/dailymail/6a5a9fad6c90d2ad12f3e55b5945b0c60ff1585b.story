Confronting and hurtful comments faced every day by people with a disability are at the centre of a new campaign to raise awareness about disabilities.

People living with a disability and their families, friends and carers are being asked to share the worst thing they've heard people say about someone who is disabled.

The results, which are being shared on social media with the hashtag #heardwhilstdisabled as part of the Chatterbox Challenge charity, are confronting and at times stupid.

People living with a disability and those around them, like carer Ana Maria Martinez, have shared the worst things they've heard about someone who is disabled for a charity campaign

Australian Paralympic swimmer Karni Liddell is encouraging the campaign and says dealing with hurtful, disrespectful and insulting comments was one of the greatest challenges faced by those with a disability.

'I've had some doozies over the years,' Liddell, who has spent 20 years in a wheelchair, told Daily Mail Australia.

'Overseas you get a lot about (a disability) being karma. Places like Buddhist or Hindu countries believe people with disabilities have done something bad in a past life. They say it's a curse, and it's quite confronting.

The results, including that of carerJennifer Skerry, are being shared on social media with the hashtag #heardwhilstdisabled as part of the Chatterbox Challenge charity

David Smith says he has been asked if he can walk, despite being confined to a wheelchair

Helen Keogh overheard someone being asked if they sleep in their wheelchair

'Random people here in Australia also feel really comfortable asking me if I can have kids. I'm 35, it's a sensitive topic. Most women my age wouldn't appreciate it.'

Liddell, who has a degenerative muscle wasting disease, said she also gets regularly asked whether her disease is genetic and if she can die from it.

'There's a 50 percent chance I'm going to say yes and then the people end up feeling like s***,' she said. 

'People also say 'it must be really hard for you to find a partner', but how do they know that's the reason I'm single? It's just amazing how people feel comfortable saying that to your face.

Australian Paralympic swimmer Karni Liddell is encouraging the campaign and says dealing with insensitive comments is one of the greatest challenges faced by people with a disability

Comments like 'They say I'm stupid' overhead by people like Liam Smith are often confronting and hurtful

Others who are participating in the campaign, including Michelle Simonds, say they're often treated differently to able-bodied people

Leslie Sherry says he is treated differently because he is in a wheelchair and claims to have had a bad experience with authorities

'I was born with my disability, so there wasn't really any trauma behind it. But some people had really traumatic experiences and people constantly ask them about it.' 

Others who have shared their stories in the #heardwhilstdisabled campaign have been asked if they can walk despite being in a wheelchair and if their disability is curable. 

Comments like 'Why do they let them live?', 'Look at those spasos' and 'Do you sleep in your wheelchair?' have also been shared.

#heardwhilstdisabled is just one of the initiatives of the 2014 Chatterbox Challenge. Joshua Bradshaw shared his experience with the campaign

'Is he fixable?' was overheard by Bradley Cresswell and raises questions about what is socially acceptable to ask someone with a disability

Special education teacher Tracey Newton was once asked if she was a vegetable keeper in reference to people with a disability

Judi Shields, pictured here with her brother, says she has constantly been told her parents must have sinned because her brother is in a wheelchair

'What people don't realise it that I don't wheel around all day wishing I could walk. That doesn't even enter my head until someone asks about it or brings it up,' Liddell said. 

'For people that use a wheelchair to get around it feels as natural and normal for us as it is to walk. 

'But people still say 'you're really good at manoeuvring that, you must have been doing that for a long time'. 

'I do understand people are just curious. But I know I can't just go up to random people on the street and ask about their relationship or family life. It's the same for people with a disability. There a limit and many just don't understand that.'

Carer Bianca Fourie says she overheard a person asking how someone could put up with a particular disabled woman

Corrine Poynterhas has overheard people asking if disabilities can be passed on to her children

Terry Donaldson, who is in a wheelchair, says his dentist assumed he must have Down's Syndrome because he couldn't walk

Christine Schvlze, Kylie Greenwood and Kim Duffen put in a combined effort when they shared their overheard post on social media

Liddell said it was important for people to realise those with a disability are the same as others and shouldn't be treated different when it came to conversations.

'Just because we have a disability doesn't mean we don't have the exact same issues, likes and dislikes as an able-bodied person,' she said. 

'I'd really love to live in a society where disability is not the worst thing that could happen to someone. We can't control it, we've been dealt this card.'

#heardwhilstdisabled is just one of the initiatives of the 2014 Chatterbox Challenge.

People are also being encouraged people to pick one day during September to remain silent for a minute, hour or the whole day in a bid to raise funds for the charity.
