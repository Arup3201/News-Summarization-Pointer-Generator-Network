There were plenty of risque dresses on the red carpet at the GQ Men Of The Year Awards in London tonight - but not from Pippa Middleton who cut a demure figure on the red carpet.

The Duchess of Cambridge's younger sister, 30, looked elegant in a pale pink sequinned dress by event sponsor Hugo Boss.

There was something of a 1930s vibe about her look with the low chignon and the ankle-length hem.

She accessorised with a box clutch, diamond oval hoop earrings, a matching bracelet and bronze strappy sandals.

Miss Middleton was on hand at the event to present the Innovator of the Year award, which went to Fortnum & Mason Chief Executive Ewan Venters.

The socialite's stockbroker boyfriend, Nico Jackson, was not present, however as one of the guests of honor, she was seated next to Conde Nast International President Nicholas Coleridge.

Indeed, Miss Middleton can no longer rely on Mr Jackson to escort her to such events. He is now based in Geneva, Switzerland, having quit his job at Deutsche Bank in favour of a hedge fund there.

It seems the couple are making plenty of time to see each other, though. They were pictured together only last week at a polo match in Gstaad.
