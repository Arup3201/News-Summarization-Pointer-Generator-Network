Another victim: 2007 Gang-rape victim Kainat Soomro was labelled a 'black virgin' and shunned by her rural village after she accused her alleged attackers

The brave fight of a gang-rape victim shunned by her rural Pakistani village for accusing her alleged attackers is now the subject of a heartbreaking documentary.

Kainat Soomro was labelled a 'kari', or 'black virgin', and her own family ordered to kill her in order to rid themselves of shame after she said she was attacked by four men as a 13-year-old in 2007.

But the teenager's relatives refused to turn their back on Kainat, and vowed to support her as she took the extraordinary step of fighting for justice in defiance of moral laws that have been in place in Pakistan for centuries.

The years that have passed since Kainat's nightmare ordeal have proved no less difficult, with her family forced out of their village, Dadu, amid threats of violence and murder.

Her father and one of her brothers were beaten, while an older brother disappeared for three months before being found murdered.

Kainat's pursuit of the case through a legal system which places the burden of proof on the victim ended with her alleged attackers being acquitted.

Kainat and her family, who now live in a cramped two bedroom apartment in Karachi, say they have 'lost everything', a report on news.com.au said.

A documentary, called Outlawed in Pakistan, tells the story of Kainat's fight for justice against the odds. The documentary, first unveiled at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, aired for the first time on U.S. television last week.

'They told me I am not a real man,' 
Kainat’s brother, Sabir, tells film-makers Habiba Nosheen and Hilke 
Schellmann.

'[that] you failed to follow your tradition, you failed to 
kill your sister.'

Viewers watch as Kainat hires a lawyer, makes television appearances and appeals against court decisions.

But despite her persistence, the film's narrator tells how the judge describes her accusations as 'a product of her own fantasy'.

Following their acquittal, the men she accused wonder why she didn't just stay home 'and keep quiet'.

Outlawed in Pakistan shines a spotlight on the fight Kainat insists she will never give up, in spite of the seemingly insurmountable obstacles in her path.
