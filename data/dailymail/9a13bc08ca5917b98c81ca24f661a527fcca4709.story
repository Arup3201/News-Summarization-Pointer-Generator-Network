Paul Scholes believes Rio Ferdinand would have played alongside John Terry for England at Euro 2012 despite the racism storm involving his brother Anton.

Chelsea defender Terry was accused of making a racially charged remark to QPR player Anton Ferdinand during a match at Loftus Road in November 2011.

He was found not guilty of racial abuse by a court but received a four-match suspension and £220,000 fine from the Football Association.

Terry was named in Roy Hodgson's squad for the European Championships in Ukraine and Poland but Ferdinand was left at home.

But Scholes, who played alongside Ferdinand at Manchester United for the best part of a decade, believes he would have put the controversy behind him to line up with Terry for England.

Writing in his column for The Independent, Scholes said: 'It struck me that despite what had happened, and the strength of Rio's feelings about it, he said that he would still have played alongside John at Euro 2012.

'What happened between Anton and Terry at Loftus Road was a bad situation, and its fall-out was enormous. I would never for one moment trivialise racism.

'Terry was cleared in court of racial abuse and found guilty of a racial remark by an independent Football Association commission. Yet it was an issue Rio would have laid aside to play at Euro 2012.

'No one would underestimate the seriousness of the issue between Rio and Terry. But if Rio told Hodgson he could handle being in the same team as Terry, that is all that matters. He should have been in that England squad.'

England were eliminated by Italy on penalties in the quarter-finals of the tournament.

Scholes also says Manchester City's Yaya Toure 'doesn't look interested' this season and is not putting in the same amount of defensive work as he did last year.

Toure looked fatigued during City's defeat to Bayern Munich in the Champions League on Wednesday night and their midfield was overrun.

Scholes wrote: 'Yaya Toure's lack of defensive work in midfield has become a major problem for them.

'The amount of time I saw opponents get in behind him in the game in Munich was quite remarkable.

'Alongside him, Fernandinho is having to do the work of two players defensively and against Bayern that was always going to cause City problems.'
