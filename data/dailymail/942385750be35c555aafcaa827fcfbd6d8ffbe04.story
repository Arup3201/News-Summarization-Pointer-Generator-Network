This is the staggering photo diary of a mother who shed 12 stone in as many months - to make sure she would live to look after her disabled son.

Jane Morgan, 38, tipped the scales at 28 stone when she was at her largest.

Bingeing on takeaways and whole packets of biscuits, she piled on the pounds in her twenties and ballooned when her two sons Connor, ten, and Callum, eight, were born.

Start: Mother-of-two Jane Morgan, 38, weighed 28 stone at her largest, pictured, and was a size 32

One month in: Ms Morgan, who had a gastric bypass in September 2012, drops a stone in just a month

Noticeable results: The mother manages to maintain losing 14lbs every four weeks over the festive period

Callum, who has extensive brain damage, is unable to walk, talk, or feed himself after he was starved of oxygen at birth.

Ms Morgan, from Basildon, Essex, was spurred into action last year when she visited the doctors for a check up - and they said because of her weight she would die before Callum was a teenager.

The mother secured a gastric bypass on the NHS and the weight has dropped off her at the rate of about a stone-a-month.

Dropping pounds: The former trainee nurse weighs under 25 stone in February of this year

Fitting: Ms Morgan, from Basildon, wears the same top as she did in November - which now hangs off her

Looking good: The mother-of two, who was spurred into losing weight for her disabled son Callum, looks thrilled with the results after six months and now weighs around 22 stone

She once became stuck in size 32 jeans but now weighs a healthier 15 stone and has shrunk to a 16 dress size.

Today, Ms Morgan said: 'I was terrified that I would die and leave my boys without a mum.

'Callum can't eat, he can't walk, he can't talk but he's still very naughty and cheeky in his own way.

'My boys are everything to me. They are hard work but they give me so much back.

New lifestyle: Ms Morgan, who would gorge on packs of biscuits, shows off her figure in a summery top

Much slimmer: Now under 20 stone, the mother is half the woman she was

Home straight: Ms Morgan who weighs around 17 stone in this image is totally transformed

'I'm grateful I can live to see them grow up now.'

Ms Morgan's weight first began to creep up when she suffered relentless bullying at school.

She binged on fast food such as KFC and McDonalds and hit 20 stone by the time she was 18.

She piled on more pounds when Connor was born and her weight gain accelerated when Callum suffered birth complications.

After Callum was born, she was forced to give up her career as a trainee nurse to become a full-time carer for her son.

Goal weight: The mother, wearing her old size 32 trousers above, is now a healthier 15 stone and a size 16

 Calorific dinners such as pie and chips plus fast food binges of McDonalds or KFC

Daily Chinese and Indian takeaways

Trips to Starbucks would see her gorge on full-fat lattes plus a chocolate muffin

Salads, always served with a low-fat  dressing

Dinners of marinated chicken breast with steamed vegetables plus fruit

Trips to Starbucks are minus the muffin and the latte is now with skimmed milk

Ms Morgan, who was also developing symptoms of sleep apnoea - interrupted breathing when asleep - because of her size, underwent the gastric bypass in September last year.

Surgeons attached the top section of her stomach directly to her small intestine, bypassing most of the stomach and her bowels.

Since then the mother has not been able to eat more than a starter-sized portion of food.

She added: 'I go to KFC with the boys now and I'll feel ill after one drumstick because of the grease.

'If I'd kept going the way I was then I would have been dead within five years.'

Ms
Morgan says she has now changed her diet - and no longer eats sugary sweats or chocolate and limits the amount of carbohydrates she consumes.

Incentive: Ms Morgan, pictured left at her heaviest with her son Callum and after her transformation right, says she's grateful she will now be able to look after her two sons

The mother said: 'You can't just have the bypass and leave it all to happen. You have to watch what you eat.

'My body will even itself out eventually and there are some foods now that I just can't tolerate.

'I can't eat bread now and I don't eat sweets or chocolate at all.

'I had even got stomach ulcers because of the reaction of some of the unhealthier foods at the beginning.'
