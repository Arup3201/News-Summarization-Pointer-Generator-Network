Weighing in at 2st 2Ib, Ulric the cat (pictured below) is as heavy as a three year old child and is believed to be the heaviest cat in Britain. He’s also just been put on a crash diet by his owner to try to save his life.

The tubby tomcat has been declared as morbidly obese by vets after he ballooned to twice his normal weight.

The seven-year-old Norwegian Forest cat spent years stealing his sister Ulla’s food and gorging on cat biscuits.

Fat cat:

His
 monster appetite coupled with his dislike for any exercise has meant 
that he has rocketed to the average weight of a three-year-old child.

Ulric has now been entered into a pet slimming competition 
after experts said his alarming size could have serious consequences for
 his life expectancy. 

Owner Jan Mitchell has already started putting 
Ulla’s food on her kitchen worktop, which Ulric is unable to jump to 
because of his sheer size. She said Ulric's sister weighs a healthy 
12lbs, which is less than half the size of her large brother.

Mrs 
Mitchell, 68, a retired secretary from Dorchester, Dorset, said: ‘We got
 Ulric and his sister Ulla in 2006 when they were three-months-old.

‘I don’t remember him being particularly abnormally large, but by the time he was 15-months-old he was 1st 3lbs.

Super-sized: weighing in at 2stone 2ibs Uric (pictured with his owner Jan Mitchell from Dorchester) is twice the weight he should be and weighs as much as a toddler

Crash diet: Uric has gotten so fat that vets have put him on a crash diet to save his life

‘We couldn’t really work out why he had got so fat - his diet only consisted of dry cat food and water, nothing elaborate.

‘We had to move Ulla’s food up onto the kitchen worktop to stop him eating that too.

She
 added the first time she realised he had some weight behind him was 
when she was sat in the sitting room and the door came flying open from 
where he had pushed it.

‘We had to lock him in the conservatory at night otherwise he would come crashing into the bedroom,’ she added.

Mrs
 Mitchell said nothing she did stopped him getting bigger but when he 
hit the two stones mark ‘that’s when alarm bells started ringing.’

Over-eater: Ms Mitchell was shocked to discover she owns Britain's fattest cat. She said she thought he got so big by stealing his sister's food

‘He
 wasn’t healthy and had trouble moving,’ she said. ‘He is a lovely cat 
but he’s just very greedy and lazy, he doesn’t do any exercise and 
spends all day lying around.

‘I have even tried to take him for a walk on a lead but he didn’t want to know.’Concerned for Ulric’s health, Jan entered him into a pet slimming competition run by animal charity PDSA.

He
 is the heaviest cat ever to take part in the competition and now has 
his food weighed to make sure he is eating the correct amount.

Stella
 Hughes, a head nurse for the PDSA, said: ‘Ulric is morbidly obese, 
which can have very serious consequences for his health and life 
expectancy.

Lazy cat: Ulric's weight gain has also been put down to his dislike of exercise.

‘Overweight pets are less mobile, less willing to play and more likely to develop a number of serious health conditions.

‘The good news is it’s never too late to make a positive change and improve a pet’s lifestyle.

‘We’re confident that Ulric will have a slim-line figure and new lease of life by the end of the competition.’

Big
 as he is, Ulric is not the heaviest cat in the world. That dubious 
honour  goes to US tomcat Sponge Bob, the nine-year-old who weighs a huge
 2st 5lb — as much as a grown Labrador or four-year-old child.

At 2ft
 with a 27in waist he’s believed to be the world’s fattest cat. He’s so 
big he is unable to clean himself and struggles to walk. Previous 
fattest cat, Meow - also from the US - died at 2st 11lb last year.
