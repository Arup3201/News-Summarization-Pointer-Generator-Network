'A sham': Accountant Marian Herron, 59, is claiming unfair dismissal from from Land Securities

An accountant was forced out of her job at a major corporation because of her foreign accent, a tribunal heard today.

Model employee Marian Herron, 59, claims she was sacked in a 'sham redundancy process' the day before Land Securities announced a £378.9m profit.

Ms Herron, 59, worked as a £40,000-a-year service charge administrator for the FTSE100 firm, which deals in commercial property.

Originally from Singapore, she claims bosses singled her out because of her foreign accent coupled with the fact she was nearing retirement age.

Ms Herron, who calculated service charges for tenants in the department, lost her job in the reshuffle and was made redundant last November despite good performance and never taking a day off sick.

The London Central Employment Tribunal heard a temporary worker in Ms Herron’s department, who was much younger, was offered a permanent job the week before.

Land Securities’ portfolio includes some of UK’s largest shopping centres.

The tribunal heard Ms Herron had been working at the firm’s head office in the Strand.

Judges were told the firm ‘restructured’ the department Ms Herron worked in last summer, cutting staff numbers from 22 to 12.

Land Securities, a FTSE100 firm, is the company behind some of London's biggest building projects such as this 630ft high Walkie Talkie Tower in Fenchurch Street, London, set for completion in 2014

Senior manager Amy Hayward admitted the redundancy process was a 'sham' but denied discrimination on the grounds of race or age.

Ms Hayward drew up a job description for the role of 'property accountant' but admitted there was ‘no real distinction’ between that role and Ms Herron's old job.

‘It was two ways of saying exactly the same thing,’ she said.

She admitted that past performance of workers were not considered when they were forced to re-apply for their jobs.

Michael Tanney, representing Ms Herron, asked: ‘Doesn’t it defy logic to rule out the fact that the employee was a much sought out adviser to senior colleagues?’

Ms Hayward replied: ‘Yes it does defy logic, when you put it like that.’

The tribunal also heard that the department made another temporary employee, much younger than Ms Herron, permanent just days before the redundancy process started.

That worker kept her job at the firm after the shake-up despite her lack of experience.

Ms Hayward denied the process was rigged and that Ms Herron was made redundant unfairly because of her age and accented English.

Many of the staff involved in implementing the redundancy process have since lost their jobs, the tribunal heard.

Ms Herron is claiming for unfair dismissal, race discrimination and age discrimination.

The hearing continues.
