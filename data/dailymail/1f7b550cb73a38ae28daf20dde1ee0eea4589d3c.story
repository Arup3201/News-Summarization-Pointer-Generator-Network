A designer has created a glittering sculpture using the nose cone of the iconic Concorde supersonic aircraft.

Sebastian Conran crafted the piece of art, called Icon, using the nose cone rescued from the Concorde prototype and five tonnes of polished stainless steel, burr walnut, and bronze.

The seven metre-long sculpture was inspired by the sonic waves that the aircraft would have made by hitting
the earth's atmosphere at speeds of more than Mach II. It swivels on a bearing and 
shows the nose tilted, as it would have been on take-off.

Rolls-Royce aero-engine specialists Simon Jeffs and Rob Gearing rescued the nose cone from theÂ  prototype and 
contacted Mr Conran as he had worked on the design of the airliner's interior design. Icon will be revealed for the first time at Royal Ascot races this June.

Mr Conran, the brother of designer Jasper Conran, says his work celebrates 'the intersection of art and technology'.

He told Design Week: 'This sculpture has represented years of hard work from everyone involved in bringing it to life.

'The best reward is that we get to display it at such an iconic and historic event and we are honoured Royal Ascot has chosen Icon as their main sculpture this year.

'It is a great feeling to know thousands of people will soon get to experience and admire this important piece of engineering history.'

Concorde was an Anglo-French turbojet-powered supersonic passenger airliner that entered service in 1976 and flew commercial flights for 27 years.

It could fly from London to New York in less than half the time of other airliners. Despite this, only 20 were built and the aircraft was retired in 2003.

Concorde was retired in 2003 after 27 years of service.
