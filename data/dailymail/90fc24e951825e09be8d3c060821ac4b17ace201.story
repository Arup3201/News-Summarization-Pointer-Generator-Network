Liverpool winger Raheem Sterling was given a private pep talk by England manager Roy Hodgson in Tallinn on Saturday night as the Three Lions were told 'No excuses' against a Estonia team ranked 81st in the world.

Hodgson noticeably pulled Sterling to one side as the other England players made a close inspection of the pitch they will be playing on at Le Coq Arena.

The 19-year-old has struggled to make an impact in recent games and was taken off at half-time in the 5-0 victory against San Marino on Thursday night, with Hodgson saying afterwards he could always learn from Wayne Rooney how to handle pressure as a young player.

Hodgson refused to give details of his one-on-one with Sterling, saying: 'I am not to disclose what Raheem and I were talking about. I don't go around telling people what I've been talking about.

'It is not unusual to chat with players. Of course with everyone watching there will be speculation. I will allow the speculation to run wild but I don't intend to fuel it in any way.'

Hodgson has admitted that he would have liked more time to prepare for Sunday's Euro 2016 qualifer even though England will be hot favourites to maintain their 100 per cent record in the group, just 72 hours after beating San Marino 5-0 in a one-sided contest at Wembley.

Strangely, Hodgson said there was a 'little bit of tiredness' among his players because they had so much of the ball against San Marino and Aston Villa midfielder Fabian Delph may in line for a recall at the expense of James Milner.

Delph was one of England's key players in their impressive opening group game victory away to Switzerland.

But the England manager also warned Wayne Rooney and his team-mates the quick turnaround between matches is not a reason to take their foot off the pedal against opponents who were beaten 1-0 in Lithuania on the same night.

Hodgson said: 'It is the same for both teams. Estonia have had two days to recover like us and they had to return from an away match. This qualifying campaign is a new format, in the past it was every team playing at the same time, now the games are spread.

'We have to come to terms with that but I am confident we will be fresh. But if you asked me if I would prefer more time, I would. Maybe we will in future qualifiers.

'We have a lot of respect for Estonia, they have come a long way since I faced them in 1992 shortly after they became independent.

'We have had two scouts studying every Estonia game since the draw was made so I've got no excuses about how they play. I can't say I didn't realise what they were good at. We know it will be different kettle of fish to San Marino.'

Unusually, England decided not train at the matchday venue, Le Coq Arena, because of their schedule caused by two games in quick succession, but they did take a stroll to check on the surface, which captain Rooney declared as 'excellent'.

Rooney, sat alongisde Hodgson, was asked if England could win all 10 group games and go to France 2016 with the perfect record.

'We would like to do that but the most important thing is to qualify and be in the draw for the European Championship,' he said.
