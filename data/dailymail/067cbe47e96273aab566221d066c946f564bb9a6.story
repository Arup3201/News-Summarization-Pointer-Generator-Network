Smiling for the camera as they enjoy a drink in a bar with friends, these are the backpackers Hannah Witheridge and David Miller just hours before they were murdered on a Thai holiday island. 

The picture was taken by another backpacker in a sports club in Kah Tao at 9.45pm. Just nine hours later, they were discovered dead. 

Thai police have yet to make any arrests for their murder, and have warned of a Mafia-like code of silence on the island.

The picture shows both backpackers together with a group of people at a sports pub on Kah Tao, the night before they were murdered.

It shows 23-year-old Miss Witheridge on the far left wearing a pink top, holding a cocktail, smiling at the camera.

While Mr Miller, 24 can be seen second from the right in a grey-coloured T-shirt, also smiling for the photograph.

Others in the group at the Choppers pub also appear in high spirits, with one girl giving a thumbs up towards the camera.  

However, early the next morning and just hours after the photo was taken, the bodies of the pair were found mutilated on Sairee beach on the island after they were bludgeoned to death with a garden hoe. 

It is thought that the pair did not know each other when they arrived at the bar with separate groups of friends and that they also left the pub separately.  

The picture comes after claims the British pair may have been arguing with a local gangster before they were murdered last week.

Thai police have so far failed to produce a credible suspect after changing their line of investigation several times. 

There have been claims that Miss Witheridge, left, and Mr Miller, right had argued with a local gangster before they were murdered last week 

Now it has emerged that Thailand's government has deployed a security team to the island to crackdown on mafia-type behaviour.

According to the Bangkok Post, it comes amid fears that a number of influential people were involved in the murder of the backpackers.

The Nation newspaper also added that the security team will target rackets and illegitimate businesses on Kah Tao, as well as punishing soldiers and police who 'patronise these people or activities.'

The news comes as police said on Tuesday that were they are close to arresting 'more than one' suspect.

Police have been taking DNA swabs and footprints of people on the island in a bid to find the killers of the British pair 

It is believed that Thai Police were to force every man on the island to take a DNA test as part of the investigation

Police Lieut-General Panya Mamen said all suspects had been questioned and two had been singled out.

'We are now confident we have the evidence about who are the murderers,' he said.

'I am confident they will be arrested and charged this week.'

It was also reported Thai police were to force every man on the island to take a DNA test. 

Initial tests show DNA samples found on the bodies almost certainly came from two Asian men, though detectives have now said that they now believe at least three people were involved in the attack. 

A police diver searches clues close to where the pair's bodies were found. Local police have come under fire for their handling of the case 

Miss Witheridge and Mr Miller were found bludgeoned to death with a garden hoe close to this spot in Kah Tao 

Thai police said they 'still believe sexual jealousy is at the heart of this crime'. 

Miss Witheridge and Mr Miller were found bludgeoned to death on Sairee beach on September 15.

Police had said their prime suspect was a fisherman who had already fled the island on a private boat.

However, police have come under fire for their handling of the case which critics say has descended into chaos.

Local media in particular have turned on their force, claiming its incompetence stretches way beyond this investigation.
