This is the heartwarming moment a two-year-old boy hears for the very first time after being fitted with cochlear ear implants. 

Asher Goldberg from Phoenix, Arizona, was born deaf and his parents tried in vain to find a method of communicating with him but nothing seemed to work. 

However, in February the youngster had small electrodes  implanted in his ear canals by specialists at Phoenix Children's Hospital and his stunned reaction to sound was caught on camera.

Ready, set, go: This is the heartwarming moment a two-year-old boy hears for the very first time after being fitted with cochlear ear implants

New world: In February Asher Goldberg from Phoenix, Arizona, had small electrodes implanted in his ear canals by specialists at Phoenix Children's Hospital and his stunned reaction to sound was caught on camera

 

A clip provided to ABC News shows Asher jumping and reaching for his father, Michael, as the implants are switched on.

'Hi sweetheart. Hi baby,' his mother, Robyn, says with tears of joy in her eyes.

Now, more than eight months on, Asher's parents say he is 'verbally counting, naming colors, letters, his entire family, countless nouns and verbs, and singing along (in tune) to his favorite Mickey [Mouse] songs.'

YouTube videos also show that Asher has developed a passion for dancing, shaking his hips in time to the beat which he could not hear previously.

After he was born, it took several months of testing before doctors confirmed that he was deaf.

Testing times: 'It was difficult,' his mother said, recalling the moment she received the diagnosis

'It was difficult,' his mother said, recalling the moment she received the diagnosis.

Before getting the implants fitted, the Goldbergs tried various hearing aids with no joy.

They also found signing difficult to master, with another young daughter to look after around full-time jobs. 

Indeed, Asher's father joked that his sign language skills wavered from 'awful to better than awful.'

In a last-ditch attempt to get Asher hearing, audiological specialists fitted a microphone and speech processor to the outside of his ears.

These pick up sounds in the environment and connect with internal implants, which then send electrical signals to the brain.

Cochlear implants - which take up to three hours to insert under local anesthetic - cannot cure deafness but they help Asher and children like him experience sound

Cochlear implants - which take up to three hours to insert under local anesthetic - cannot cure deafness but they help Asher and children like him experience sound.

According to the National Institutes of Health (NIH), cochlear implants are usually recommended for children aged 12 months or older. 

Asher's parents say they have been overwhelmed by the results. Mr Goldberg concluded: 'The best part, I think for both of us, he finally turned around when we said something.

'It’s not just so much that he’s hearing something but . . . It actually makes sense to him and he's using the sounds as part of his world.'
