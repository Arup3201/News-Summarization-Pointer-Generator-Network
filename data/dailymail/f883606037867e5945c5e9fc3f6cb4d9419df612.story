It's here! Kate Upton was announced as the new face of Bobbi Brown cosmetics in March and her new campaign for the Surf and Sand collection has now been unveiled

The collection launches in July and is priced between £18 - £48.

Kate showcases the new collection's new range of colours, which include sandy neutrals, surfy blues and sunset pinks.

Bobbi Brown announced Kate as its new 
ambassador via Instagram in March writing: 'Proud to announce @KateUpton
 as the new face of Bobbi Brown - a beautiful, confident, empowered 
woman.'

Miss Upton was chosen for the role by make-up artist 
and founder Bobbi Brown herself, who reveals in a YouTube video that she
 was looking for a 'confident' and 'independent' new 
ambassador.

Her latest muse appeared to be equally excited about the collaboration, exclaiming: 'You're such an inspiration and your products have been everywhere growing up.

'My mom always used them, we always used them.'

Miss Upton is the second celebrity to work with Bobbi Brown, following on from actress Katie Holmes who signed a deal with the company in 2012.

The 5ft 10in beauty told Vogue that she loves the cosmetics it produces because they're 'so light, and I’m such a Florida girl, that it just goes along with my lifestyle.'

She says she likes to keep her make-up 'very basic', applying mascara and a little blush or bronzer.

Mother-of-three Bobbi Brown, 56, founded her eponymous beauty firm in 1991.

Four years later she sold the business to Estee Lauder but to this day she maintains complete creative control.

Talking about her newest recruit, Miss Upton, the New Jersey-based make-up mogul concluded: 'Kate came to the shoot without a stitch of makeup; she is the girl next door, really fresh and the epitome of all-American.

'She not only represents beauty - although I think all women are beautiful - but she has incredibly good energy. She is happy, she is strong, she is smart, she is open, and she is really versatile.

'She’s starting to act, she’s a model; she speaks eloquently about confidence and self-esteem, which is really important to me. I think she’ll be a great [role model] for young girls to look up to.'
