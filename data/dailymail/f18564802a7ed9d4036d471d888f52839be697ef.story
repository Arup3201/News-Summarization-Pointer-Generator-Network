Two New York City cops are facing criminal charges after they were caught in disturbing footage punching and pistol-whipping a teenage suspect who had already raised his hands to surrender.

In the video obtained by DNAinfo New York, 16-year-old Kahreem Tribble is seen running away from the officers in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant about 2am on Aug. 29.

After a brief chase, Tribble stops running and turns around to face the NYPD cops in apparent surrender.

That's when one of the officers, later identified as Tyrane Isaac, approaches the teen and punches him in the head, according to DNAinfo New York.

A few seconds later, Officer David Afanador catches up to Tribble — as he raises his hands  — and whacks him in the teeth with the pistol, breaking a front tooth and chipping another, according to the news site.

Officer Isaac then later punches the teen again, the website reported.

Afanador, who leaves momentarily to find the black bag that Tribble allegedly threw out when he saw the cops, comes back a few minutes later. He waves the bag in the teen's face and smacks him with it.

The two cops began chasing Tribble near 1311 St. John's Place when they spotted the 16-year-old looking through the window of a parked vehicle, according to DNAinfo New York.

Police say Tribble tossed out a small black bag before taking off and officers feared he had a gun, the news website reported. 

Tribble was arrested with 17 small bags of marijuana, court records show. He was also charged with disorderly conduct.

Officers Isaac and Afanador, both nine-year veterans at Brooklyn's crime-ridden 79th Precinct, are now being investigated by NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau and Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson.

A Brookyln grand jury is expected to begin hearing the case next week, the New York Daily News reported.  

'What’s depicted on this video is troubling and warrants a thorough investigation,' Thompson told DNAinfo New York. 

Police Commissioner William Bratton was 'angered and embarrassed' by the incident, a source told the news site.

'Clearly, Commissioner Bratton has seen the video and reacted very aggressively in the sense of saying there have to be consequences when anything is done the wrong way,' Mayor Bill de Blasio said in reaction to the incident.

'I see these videos as another piece of information that we need to use to improve the relationship between police and community and in many cases to heal the relationship between police and community.'

Isaac has been placed on modified duty pending the result of the investigation. He's lost his gun and badge. Afanador was suspended without pay.

Both officers have two prior legal cases against them alleging brutality and false arrests, court records show.

A third officer, Christopher Mastoros, may also be disciplined for failing to do anything as his colleagues allegedly beat the teenager.
