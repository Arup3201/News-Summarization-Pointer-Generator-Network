The daughter of the 'Happy Face' serial killer has revealed how at the age of 15 she found a roll of duct tape in the bed of his long-distance truck's sleeper cabin - a moment which she brushed off but came back to haunt her, many times, years later.

Melissa Moore, now 34, has revealed in a new essay, published this week, chilling details about her father Keith Hunter Jesperson which had always left her with a lingering unease while growing up in Washington.

When she was five she watched in horror when he hung her pet kittens on a clothes line and tortured them to death, paying no heed to his young daughter's screams.

Melissa Moore has revealed in a new essay, published this week, chilling details about her father Keith Hunter Jesperson (right) which always left her with deep unease growing up in Washington. She and her husband brought their children to visit him in Oregon State Prison in 2005 but have had no contact since

Another time, he pinned down a cat and twisted the animal's head until its neck snapped, as his children looked on. Mrs Moore said she remembered the look on her father's face as 'enjoyment'.

She also described how her father's desire to describe graphic sexual details, including about sex with her own mother, and lewd comments to female strangers, made her sick to her stomach. 

In a new essay for BBC News, Mrs Moore relived the moment that her father, a 6'6', 240lb, long-distance trucker, came close to revealing his dark secret in 1994 - that he had strangled and raped seven women, and was within days of killing again.

Melissa would not see her father for long stretches following her parents' divorce in 1990. One morning that fall however he showed up and offered to take her, her sister and brother for breakfast.

Her siblings couldn't make it, so she went alone with her father to a diner. As they sat in a booth, she recalled in the essay: '[my] dad said, 'Not everything is what it appears to be, Missy.' And I said, 'What do you mean Dad?'

'I watched him wrestling with something internally. Then he said: ''You know, I have something to tell you, and it's really important.'' There was a long silence before I asked him what it was. ''I can't tell you, sweetie. If I tell you, you will tell the police. I'm not what you think I am, Melissa.'''

The moment caused the teenager to feel suddently violently ill and she ran to the bathroom. When she returned to the table, her father changed the subject.

Mrs Moore wrote: 'But I go back to that incident so often and I think: ''If he had told me, what would have happened next? If he had told me about his seven murders - it was very soon to be eight - would I have gone to the police? Having revealed his secrets, would he have given me the chance?'

Jesperson killed eight women during his years travelling America's highways and isolated truck-stops as a long-haul rig driver in the 1990s.

The serial killer earned his notoriety by sending confessions describing his heinous crimes to police and journalists and signing them with a smiley face.

He often targeted prostitutes and homeless women, raping them before strangling them to death with his bare hands as he had done with so many animals. 

Jesperson murdered his first known victim Taunja Bennett, 23, in January 1990, after meeting her at a bar near Portland, Oregon and inviting her back to a house he was renting.

He beat her and strangled her to death after they had sex, then went back out to a bar to have more drinks and provide himself with an alibi.

He later returned to the house, strapped her into the front seat of his car and disposed of the body before leaving town.

Three months later, Jesperson met Daun Richert-Slagle, a 21-year-old mother-of-three who became the only known victim to survive an attack.

The young mother had stormed out of her home in Chico, California with her infant son in her arms after having an argument with her husband on April 13, 1990.

She walked to a nearby shopping center where she struck up a conversation with Jesperson, eventually getting into his car to fight off the cold. He drove her to a  lakeside where he tried to sexually assault her for three hours in front of her baby. When she fought him off, he tried to strangle her.

Ms Richert-Slagle believes that she only survived because of her son and she managed to eventually to convince Jesperson to let her go. 

The survivor told the Oroville Mercury-Register that she had filed a police report despite Jesperson's pleas not to tell anyone.

The killer was caught by police and charged. He pleaded no contest to misdemeanor charges of sexual battery and was released. 

He vanished. 

The killer lay in wait for more than two years before he struck again in 1992, raping and strangling a woman near Blythe, California. She has still not been identified but Jesperson said her name was Claudia.

His killing spree then escalated - a month later, the truck driver raped and strangled a prostitute Cynthia Lyn Rose in Turlock, California. 

Sole survivor: Daun Richert-Slagle, a 21-year-old mother-of-three, lived after Jesperson's attempts to rape and strangle her in front of her baby son 

The next month, he killed a fourth woman, also a prostitute, named Laurie Ann Pentland from Salem, Oregon. He claimed to have strangled her because she tried to double the amount of money she wanted for sex and threatened to call the police. 

His fifth victim, a Jane Doe living on the streets in Santa Nella, California, was discovered in July of 1993. Police initially believed that she had suffered a drug overdose. 

Another Jane Doe's death, attributed to Jesperson, was found in September 1994 in Crestview, Florida. Jesperson said her name was Susanne. 

In January 1995, Jesperson committed a brutal homicide. He picked up a 21-year-old hitchhiker, Angela Subrize, whom he offered to drive from Spokane, Washington to meet her boyfriend in Indiana.

On the journey, he raped and strangled her, then strapped her body face-down to the undercarriage of his truck so her face and prints would be ground off by the road while he drove.

The killer was finally caught in March 1995 after strangling long-time girlfriend Julia Ann Winningham, who he claimed did not love him but only wanted his money. She was the only victim that he could be connected to. 

He initially refused to talk to police and attempted suicide twice. He then turned himself in, hoping for leniency at his trial.

He confessed details of his murderous history while in custody, but later recanted much of it. At one point, he claimed to have had as many as 160 victims. Only eight women have been confirmed.

Jesperson is currently serving three consecutive life sentences at the Oregon State Penitentiary in Salem.

At one point during her childhood, Mrs Moore said that she remembered a story he had told her about driving past the prison.

Mrs Moore has written a book about coming to terms with being the daughter of a serial killer 

'''I honked my horn," he told me on the phone one time,' Mrs Moore said. 'He said: ''Someday I'm gonna be there. But not yet!'"

In the essay for the BBC, his daughter Melissa revealed the years of pain trying to cope with living in the shadow of her father's terrible crimes.

She has written a book, Shattered Silence, about her father and her family's struggle to cope. She reaches out to family members of serial killers, who often cope silently with the trauma and stigma, of who they are related to. 

She said that recently, a mother of two girls whose father had killed people in Europe, had written to her as one daughter was so depressed that she had thought about committing suicide. 

The writer asked her network to reach out to the young girl to give her hope. 

Jesperson's daughter has also reached out to the family of one of her father's victims, Taunja Bennett, along with survivor Daun Richert-Slagle.

Mrs Moore said that she was able to move past her horrible deeds with the support of her husband with whom she went on to have children. She even brought her family to visit her father in prison in 2005.

However it was a conversation with her grandfather while writing her book that helped Mrs Moore finally  leave Jesperson in the past and be able to stop separating who he was as a father - which at times she remembered fondly - from the violent serial killer.

Mrs Moore's grandfather told her that Jesperson, now 59, had once admitted to thoughts of killing his own children. 

She told the BBC: 'Maybe people won't understand this, but hearing that gave me freedom. It allowed me to see that in truth there had been no double life - there had only ever been one Keith Jesperson and he had been able to manipulate everyone around him and present different facades to the world.'
