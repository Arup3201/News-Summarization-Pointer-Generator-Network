A party cruise for a Connecticut radio station ended on Sunday morning as police officers tried to control a fight that broke out on board.

Norwalk police responded at 4am after learning of an alleged fight, Sgt. Terrence Blake told MailOnline.

Blake earlier revealed in a briefing that officers witnessed a fight on the boat's lower level and 'could hear yelling and screaming going on from the same area,' local news site NancyonNorwalk reported.

Crowd: Norwalk police say they had to break up several fights once passengers from the Island Belle docked and got off

'As the vessel docked, people began to 
disembark. Officers reported seeing them carrying alcoholic beverages, 
beer bottles and such.'

Someone threw a bottle, Blake said in the briefing, but no one was arrested.

'Based on numbers, [the police] were outnumbered so as far as taking proactive action aside from trying to break up the [skirmishes] in the parking lot, that was it,' he also said.

He also said police found citing broken bottles and windows on the Island Belle.

Blake told MailOnline people at the scene refused medical treatment, but that there were injuries.

Partiers were participating in Hot 93.7's Rock Da Boat cruise, which was held in conjunction with Buddha Global Nightlife, the Hour reported.

Parking lot brawl? Norwalk police said they put an end to several fights in the parking lot

The paper said 300 people were on the Island Belle - but the boat's owner, Ken Hart, disputed that number, calling it 'so inaccurate' in the briefing, NancyonNorwalk reported.

'It was probably less than 200 people. So the noise you heard from the boat was people partying,' he said.

Hart also said the fight was stamped out before police arrived.

''There was an argument that started between two girls early in the night,' Hart said in the briefing. 'It was addressed. At the end of the night, when we came in, as people were preparing to disembark from the vessel, these two girls got into an argument again. Their boyfriends started mouthing off.

'It was a total of four people that was involved in this. But what happened is when it got to the point where they started to fight, our security, along with some of the guests, jumped in to stop it. By the time we docked at the dock, this was over.'

Blake told MailOnline police continue to investigate.
