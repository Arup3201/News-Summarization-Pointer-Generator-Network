Argentine scientists have found a way to transform the gas created by cows' digestive systems into fuel.

They claim the innovation that could curb greenhouse gases that are believed to cause global warming.

Methane is separated from the smelly cow gas, which can be used to fuel cars as well as other machines.

Argentine scientists have found a way to transform the gas created by the bovine digestive system into fuel -  an innovation that could curb greenhouse gases that cause global warming

Argentina's National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA) came up with the idea of using a system of valves and pumps to collect and process the gas.

The experimental technique channels the digestive gases from bovine stomach cavities through a tube and into a tank.

The gases - which otherwise are commonly known as burps, or 'eruptos' in Spanish - are then processed to separate methane from other gases such as carbon dioxide.

Methane is the main component of natural gas, used to fuel everything from cars to power plants.

'Once you get it compressed, it's the same as having natural gas,' said Guillermo Berra, head of INTA's animal physiology group.

'As an energy source it is not very practical at the moment, but if you look ahead to 2050, when fossil fuel reserves are going to be in trouble, it is an alternative,' he told Reuters.

Each herd of cattle emits between 250 and 300 litres of pure methane a day, which is enough energy to keep a refrigerator running for 24 hours.

Argentina is one of the world's top beef exporters, with around 51 million herds of cattle.

Gases emitted from those animals account for 30 per cent of the country's total greenhouse gas emissions, according to INTA, with methane having 23 times the global warming effect as carbon dioxide.

'This is also a way to mitigate that,' Berra said.
