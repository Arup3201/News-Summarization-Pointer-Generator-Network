One of Ukip's biggest donors has threatened to stop funding the party unless the disgraced former Tory Neil Hamilton is given a parliamentary seat, it was claimed last night.

Stuart Wheeler's alleged intervention has sparked a furious reaction – with his replacement as party Treasurer Andrew Reid insisting that 'nobody gets to buy a seat' for their friends.

The row blew up on Wednesday night after a letter to Mr Hamilton asking him to explain his expenses was leaked  – forcing him to pull out of a contest to become the party's candidate in a winnable seat in next year's election.

Mr Hamilton only saw the letter as he arrived at a hustings event in the Essex constituency of Basildon South – one of Ukip's top targets for 2015.

He then withdrew his candidacy – and slammed the letter as part of a wider 'dirty tricks' campaign against him.

But many others in Ukip believe Mr Hamilton is getting unfair leg up due to his close relationship with the millionaire party donor Mr Wheeler.

One member of the party leadership told the Financial Times: 'I don't care how powerful his patron is, we are not caving [in] to this.'

Andrew Reid, who took over from Mr Wheeler as the party's treasurer six months ago, added: 'Nobody gets to buy a seat for someone else in Ukip.'

Mr Hamilton, a former Tory minister, lost his seat in the 1997 Labour landslide to the anti-sleaze campaigner Martin Bell, who stood as an independent.

It came after he was forced to resign as a Tory minister after allegations that he received cash for asking questions in the Commons.

He denied the claims, but a parliamentary inquiry found that he took cash for questions.

The dispute could prove expensive for the party as it approaches its most important general election, at which it hopes to break through as a serious challenger to the big established parties.

Mr Wheeler has made more than £700,000 worth of registered donations to Ukip over the past five years, and was expected to remain an important donor over the coming months.

Mr Hamilton would not comment on the events.

Mr Wheeler would not say whether he intended to donate more money before the election, or whether he had threatened not to if Mr Hamilton was not accepted as a parliamentary candidate.

He told the FT: 'I cannot tell you what internal conversations have gone on.'
