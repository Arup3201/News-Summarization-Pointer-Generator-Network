Malky Mackay was left waiting for his first home win as Wigan manager after Sheffield Wednesday took advantage of Callum McManaman’s sending off to record a rare recent away victory.

Austrian striker Atdhe Nuhiu scored his sixth goal of the season to complete a solid away performance for the Owls and leave Wigan without a victory at the DW Stadium since August.

There was brief cause for cheer during the Christmas period with when Mackay recorded his first victory as manager with the 2-0 win over Leeds on Boxing Day but his side lacked the cutting edge to see off the Owls in a match lacking in quality.

McManaman was shown a straight red card in the 65th minute after sliding in on Owls defender Claude Dielna as Stuart Gray’s side put up a stubborn display.

Midfielder Adam Forshaw was central to much of the hosts’ bright play in the early stages and his strong run at the heart of the Sheffield Wednesday defence forced Chris Maguire, tracking back from midfield, to hack the ball clear over his own bar.

The Owls have won only once on their travels since their promising start to the season in September and set their stall out to attack on the break.

Stuart Gray’s side fashioned their first chance courtesy of a counter-attack in the 20th minute when Jacques Maghoma stole possession in the Wigan half and delivered a teasing low cross. It evaded Scott Carson in the Wigan goal but also Nuhiu in the Wednesday attack.

Lewis McGugan went close with a deflected low drive from 30 yards that zipped just wide of the post as the Owls got a foothold in the match.

James McClean did his best to provide the penetration when he carried the ball from the edge of his own area into a shooting position but saw his drive from a tight angle pushed away by Keiren Westwood.

There was a late cameo for Honduras midfielder Roger Espinoza as he made what is likely to be his last appearance for Wigan. The 28-year-old has grown unsettled at the DW Stadium and has reached an agreement to be released from the last six months of his contract.

He was greeted by warm applause by the home fans but their mood was soured when McManaman saw red.

The Latics almost snatched a point in the closing stages but Ivan Ramis saw his header come back off the post following Shaun Maloney’s inswinging free-kick. 

James McLean had the ball in the back of the net but it was ruled out for offside
