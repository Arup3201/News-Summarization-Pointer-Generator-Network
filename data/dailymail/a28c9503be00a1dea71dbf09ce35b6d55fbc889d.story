A video showing Baltimore Ravens' running back Ray Rice punching his fiancee in the face and knocking her out cold has been released online.

The incident took place last February in the Revel Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City following a heated argument between Rice and Janay Palmer, who are now married.

Baltimore Ravens tweeted on Monday that they have terminated the contract of Rice and shortly after NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell announced that a two-game ban in July had been upgraded to an indefinite suspension.

The punch lifts Palmer off her feet before she hits her head on a hand rail, rendering her unconscious. Once the door opens, Rice drags her out into the hotel.

He was later arrested and charged before being suspended by the NFL for two-matches and fined $500,000 (£310,000).

A former employee told TMZ Sports, who released the video, that the NFL saw the video before issuing their punishment.

The 27-year-old married Palmer in March, a month after the vicious attack and just a day after he was formally charged with assault and domestic violence. He could face a jail term of three to five years if convicted.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell has since admitted he 'didn't get it right' in Rice's case and that harsher penalties will be issued in the future.

Rice, who signed a £21million, five-year deal in 2012, is due to return to action on September 12.
