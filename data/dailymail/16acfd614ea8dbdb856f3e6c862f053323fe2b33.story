Sir Patrick Stewart has revealed that he regrets missing time with his children when he was younger

Actor Sir Patrick Stewart has revealed that he regrets having worked so much when he was younger - and admitted that it damaged his family.

The X-Men actor said that he ‘missed huge amounts of time’ and that he would barely see his children once a week.

Stewart said that it was ‘hard’ on son Daniel and daughter Sophia and that he wished things had been different.

He said that he only took his latest film because it was shot round the corner from his new home in Brooklyn, New York.

In an interview, Stewart, 74, described how he would come home when he wanted and spent plenty of time with third wife, jazz singer Sunny Ozell, 36.

Stewart and his first wife Sheila Falconer divorced in 1990 after 24 years of marriage and two children. 

By that stage he had been a prolific stage actor with the Royal Shakespeare Company and had been playing Star Trek’s Jean Luc Picard for three years.

The role demanded that he live in Los Angeles and work to a gruelling schedule.

In an interview with the New York Daily News, Stewart said: ‘When I got married and I had children, I missed huge amounts of time.

‘I would see my kids on Sundays if I was lucky. It was hard on my kids.’

Sir Patrick only took on a role in his new film Match because filming took place not far from his apartment in Brooklyn, where he lives with his third wife Sunny Ozell

Stewart said that he is loving living in Brooklyn and relishing the work-life balance it affords him.

His new film, ‘Match’, in which he plays a ballet teacher who pursued his professional career at the expense of his personal life, was shot on a more leisurely schedule than he is used to.

Stewart said: ‘We (him and Ozell) had our breakfast and our lunch sitting at the kitchen table of (our) apartment.

‘I would take my naps or rests whenever I could get them on my bed in the apartment. It was home.’
