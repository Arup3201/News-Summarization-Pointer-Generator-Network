He loves to show off his penchant for all things fashion but Kanye West's forays into design haven't previously met with success.

Now the rapper hopes to make a comeback and has reportedly enlisted Balmain's former creative director Christophe Decarnin to help him make it in the cutthroat industry.

Partnership: According to reports, Kanye has signed up former Balmain designer Christophe Decarnin

The controversial 'Black Skinhead' star hasn't presented his clothing on the catwalk since 2011, when he showcased his spring/summer 2012 and autumn/winter 2012 debut collections to lukewarm reviews.

More recently, the rapper indulged in a spat with Fendi, who, claimed Kanye, had 'stolen' his designs, including leather jogging trousers.

Kanye has yet to reveal whether his label will continue, but reports have been circulating for months about his big return to the runway and his ambitions recently received a fillip after a nine-piece collection in collaboration with A.P.C. sold out within hours.

And it would appear that West has had a return to the catwalk under his own name on his mind for a considerable period of time.

Earlier this month, a job ad on LinkedIn, a website used as a networking tool by professionals, claimed to be searching for the future Vice President and Chief Financial Officer for the as yet unnamed 'Kanye West clothing project'.

The post read: 'The venture will be very high profile, and unlike those in which celebrities merely lend their name to a label, this venture will have the power of Mr. West's creative genius at the heart and soul of it.'
