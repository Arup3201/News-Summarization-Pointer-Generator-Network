Mexico's most powerful drug cartel leader employed high-tech communications gadgetry and sophisticated counterespionage practices to elude an international manhunt for 13 years, according to a news agency.

In the end, however, life on the run unraveled for Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman in a decidedly low-tech way.

A traditional wiretap in southern Arizona pointed authorities to a cellphone being used by a top associate. Within a day, Guzman was captured in a high-rise beachfront condominium in Mazatlan, Mexico.

Guzman's penchant for technology and 
his efforts to stay ahead of the law were described to the Associated Press by a 
senior law enforcement official with direct knowledge of Guzman's years 
on the run and by a U.S. government official who was briefed on the 
case.

Both spoke only on condition of anonymity because they were not 
authorized to discuss the situation by name.

'He didn't spare any expenses when it came to protecting himself,' the law enforcement official said.

Some
 of the communications equipment Guzman used was not generally available
 to consumers. The sophistication of the gear and Guzman's diligence 
deeply impressed investigators who were pursuing him. Among other 
practices, Guzman employed countersurveillance scanners to detect 
transmitters hidden in rooms or carried by people with whom he was 
meeting.

'It was top-notch,' the law enforcement official said.

Because
 Guzman was so well protected, he managed to attend family events and 
marry a local beauty queen in a well-attended bash in his home state of 
Sinaloa, all while keeping his multinational, billion-dollar drug empire
 thriving.

U.S. and Mexican 
officials spent years hunting for a weak spot in his network. The U.S. 
government official said the Drug Enforcement Administration and 
Immigration and Customs Enforcement used traditional wiretaps to zero in
 on Guzman. At times in the last year, agents were able to intercept 
BlackBerry messages and other communications.

Earlier
 this month, authorities raided one of Guzman's suspected hideouts in 
Culiacan, the capital city of Sinaloa, where Guzman operated with near 
impunity. Inside, they found a cellphone belonging to his communications
 chief, which helped lead to a trusted courier, the government official 
said.

The courier later 
described for authorities a series of houses Guzman used as hideouts. At
 least one other arrest pointed Guzman's pursuers to the Pacific Coast 
city of Mazatlan.

The most 
important clue came from an ICE wiretap monitored in Nogales, Ariz. That
 information directed Mexican marines to the exact condominium where 
Guzman had been hiding since outrunning troops days earlier through 
interconnected tunnels beneath his Culiacan hideouts.

The officials would not discuss the specific methods used over the last 13 years.

The
 law enforcement official said Guzman wasn't holed up in the rugged 
mountains of western Mexico while on the run. With the help of his own 
trusted security force and the likely assistance of some Mexican 
authorities, Guzman had moved freely about parts of Mexico and even 
internationally.

'He moved 
for the most part with impunity (in Culiacan),' the official said. 'He 
traveled at will. He had private planes. He was a businessman and he 
would go and meet people to discuss not just the drug trade. He was 
obviously interested in the money trade, the markets. He was looking at 
expanding the empire.'

By 
the time of his capture, Guzman's empire stretched from Canada through 
Latin America, Europe, parts of Asia and Australia. He is believed to 
have amassed a fortune worth billions.

U.S.
 and Mexican authorities were close to nabbing Guzman in the past but 
arrived at resorts or other locations hours or days too late, the law 
enforcement official said. They were never closer than in recent weeks.

Last
 week, Guzman's pursuers were on his heels during raids at the stash 
houses in Culiacan. The law enforcement official said Guzman was 
believed to be just ahead of Mexican troops when he vanished in the 
underground network below the houses before absconding to the high-rise 
condo in Mazatlan, along the coast.

El
 Chapo appears set to remain in Mexico's highest-security prison for the
 foreseeable future, as the government puts off U.S. extradition in a 
move that could bolster President Enrique Pena Nieto's nationalist 
credentials but also shine a spotlight on the country's woeful judicial 
system.

Experts say Pena 
Nieto's administration and those of his predecessors have proven unable 
to match headline-grabbing arrests like Guzman's with complex, long-term
 investigations and prosecutions of deep-rooted criminal networks.

Cases
 have stalled and cartels have continued to operate. Last year, one of 
Guzman's closest allies walked out of the prison where the U.S. said he 
was running drugs from behind bars.

The
 Mexican government says there is no way Guzman will repeat the 2001 
escape that let him roam western Mexico for 13 years as he moved 
billions of dollars of cocaine, methamphetamine and heroin around the 
world.

Authorities here say they want to be the first to interrogate Guzman, and use the information to dismantle his Sinaloa cartel.

Two
 federal judges ruled Tuesday that Guzman will have to stand trial on 
separate drug-trafficking and organized-crime charges in Mexico. Pena 
Nieto's administration said the man widely considered the world's 
most-powerful drug lord until his capture Saturday will face at least 
six other pending criminal cases before it even considers extraditing 
him to the U.S.

'I don't 
think it's going to happen anytime soon,' Attorney General Jesus Murillo
 Karam said in a radio interview. 'This is the start of a full 
investigation that will allow us to fully eradicate his organization. It
 would be pointless to do anything else.'

Experts
 on both sides of the border warned that keeping Guzman in Mexican hands
 could squander the opportunity to exploit his unparalleled knowledge of
 the country's biggest drug cartel. U.S. prosecutors have proven far 
more capable of offering captured drug lords the incentives to cooperate
 with law enforcement, experts said.

U.S.
 officials routinely use family members as tools to pressure defendants 
into giving up information, granting visas to relatives of cooperative 
prisoners while threatening to leave loved ones penniless by freezing 
assets of drug lords who refuse to play ball.

Mexican
 authorities arrested Guzman, 56, along with his 20-something former 
beauty-queen wife and twin toddlers, but let her go because there were 
no charges pending against her. Observers called it a staggering missed 
opportunity that wouldn't have occurred in the U.S.

'The
 U.S. attorneys have many tools. They're pretty good at flipping people.
 They can offer far more things than the Mexican authorities can offer,'
 said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst and former official in Mexico's
 domestic intelligence service.

One of Guzman's closest allies and mentors, Rafael Caro Quintero, walked out of a federal prison in August after a procedural ruling that cut 12 years off a 40-year sentence for killings that included the murder of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique 'Kiki' Camarena.

A three-judge federal appeals court in the western state of Jalisco found that he should have been tried in state court, not federal, and vacated his sentence in a ruling widely seen by Mexican and U.S. officials as inexplicable and likely corrupt.
