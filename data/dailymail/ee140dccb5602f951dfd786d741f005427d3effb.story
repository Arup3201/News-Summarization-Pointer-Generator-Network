John Fairfax, the first person to cross the Atlantic Ocean alone in a rowing boat, has died at the age of 74 after a lifetime of exploits and adventure.

The self-professed 'professional adventurer' died on February 8 of an apparent heart attack at his Las Vegas home, his wife Tiffany, said yesterday.

Fairfax, who was British, gained international attention in 1969 when he became the first person in recorded history to cross the Atlantic alone in a rowboat.

He dealt with sharks, storms and exhaustion on the six-month, 5,000-mile journey from the Canary Islands to Florida.

A life on the high seas: John Fairfax stands beside his 22-foot rowing boat, Britannia, at King George V Dock in London, prior to sailing to the Canary Islands from where he rowed to Miami. He died aged 74 last week

In 1972, he and his then girlfriend Sylvia Cook became the first known people to row across the Pacific Ocean.

He survived a shark attack and cyclone on the year-long, 8,000-mile trek from San Francisco to Australia.

Fairfax wrote separate books about his ocean crossings that were both published in the 1970s.

His wife said: 'He was a man of unbelievable strength and courage and confidence in everything he did. He thought nature was a worthy challenge, and he loved nature.'

John Fairfax used two different custom-made boats on the ocean journeys and looked to the stars to help him navigate.

Captain's rest: Swimmers met John Fairfax and his 22-foot rowboat when he finally reached the shore in Florida in 1969 after six months at sea

He survived by eating up to eight pounds of fish a day and had a system to convert ocean water into drinking water.

Mrs Fairfax said: 'On the Pacific, a shark took a big chunk of his arm out when he was spearing fish. There you are on the Pacific Ocean and there's no hospital, and you need to row. He was an amazing, amazing human being.'

He believed a human could accomplish 
anything if they had confidence. When he would get an idea in mind, he 
would pursue it and say, 'I can do it.'

John Fairfax enjoyed many other adventures, including time living in the Amazon jungle when he was 13 and a stint as a pirate.

He also spoke five languages, was a talented chef and regularly played the card game baccarat at Las Vegas casinos, his wife said.

She added: 'He believed a human could accomplish anything if they had confidence. When he would get an idea in mind, he would pursue it and say, ''I can do it.'''

Ms Cook, 73, who lives near London, remained lifelong friends with Mr Fairfax.

She told the New York Times after his death: 'He's always been a gambler. He was going to the casino every night when I met him - it was craps in those days. And at the end of the day, adventures are a kind of gamble, aren't they?'

His only immediate survivor is his wife of 31 years, who moved with him to Las Vegas in 1992 after a hurricane in Florida where they had lived. No public services were planned.
