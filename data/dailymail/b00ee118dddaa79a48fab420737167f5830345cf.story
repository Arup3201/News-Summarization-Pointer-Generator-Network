Former Arsenal midfielder Emmanuel Petit claims the current Arsenal side is full of 'pretty' players but lacks the toughness of former Gunners teams.

The 1998 World Cup winner played with the likes of Tony Adams and Patrick Vieira during his three-year spell at Arsenal and insists as a team they knew how to be tough. 

Ahead of Arsenal's Champions League last-16 clash against another of his former clubs Monaco at the Emirates on Wednesday, Petit says Arsene Wenger's current squad lack the steel of years gone by.

Petit claims Arsene Wenger's current side lack the steel and killer instinct of the side he played in

'You have to remember the defence that we had,' Petit was quoted as saying in the Mirror. 'You could rely on Seaman, Adams, Keown, etc.

'We knew how to travel. When we had to play, we knew how to do that too. I remember one away game at Wimbledon where Tony Adams came to say to me: "Today, Manu, forget the football. It's war". We knew how to adapt because we only wanted one thing: to win.

'Let's say that the Barcelona (style) of keeping the ball has overtaken that style,' he said.

'But today, you have to be more direct and pragmatic. You see that with Germany or Real Madrid. 

'Arsenal have very pretty players but there are not killers in this team. At that time, we were tough, we did not play to look good.'
