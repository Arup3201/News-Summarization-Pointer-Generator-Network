Smiling through: Lily Cater, 9, with her mother Michala who is living a normal life after doctors said she would never recover from her heart defect

A mother has told how her daughter’s life was saved by heart surgery – despite doctors at Leeds General Infirmary claiming ‘nothing could be done’ for her.

Michala Cater, 39, claims she was told that her two-year-old daughter Lily would not recover from her congenital heart defect and that she should ‘go away and enjoy the time she had left’ with her.

But after seeking a second opinion, Lily had surgery at Birmingham Children’s Hospital. The nine-year-old is now living a normal life.

Mrs Cater, of Bradford, believes Lily would be dead if she had listened to the consultant cardiologist at Leeds seven years ago.

At eight months old, Lily was diagnosed with pulmonary atresia, or ‘blue baby syndrome’ – when the pulmonary artery that carries blood to the lungs fails to develop properly.

Mrs Cater claims doctors at the heart unit said she would probably not live beyond five years old.

Then, when she was two, Lily took a turn for the worst. She was constantly blue and struggled to walk any distance.

‘We waited six months for the doctors to have a clinical meeting to discuss what to do,’ Mrs Cater said. ‘When we finally spoke to the cardiologist, he said he had spoken to a surgeon and there was nothing they could do for her.

‘He said she wouldn’t get on a heart transplant list because they couldn’t say for definite that she only had two months to live, but you could see how ill she was.’

In danger: Mr and Mrs Cater were told that Lily would not recover when she was two years old by Leeds General Infirmary. She was constantly blue and struggling to walk.

Mrs Cater and her husband Paul, a window
cleaner, found an American surgeon who had performed operations on 
patients similar to Lily.

The surgeon asked the couple to send him Lily’s medical notes – which Mrs Cater says the hospital took over one month to send.

It was only when Mrs Cater contacted a local newspaper to speak out about Lily’s poor treatment, that she says she received a call from her cardiologist.

Seriously ill: Lily Cater made a recovery after Birmingham Children's Hospital undertook the intricate surgery

‘He said “Why do you want to go to America for this operation, it can be done at Birmingham and Newcastle”.

‘I was shocked. We didn’t understand why he hadn’t mentioned this before.

‘He said we could try Birmingham but that they probably wouldn’t be able to do anything.

Quality of life: As soon as Lily went to the hospital in Birmingham they promised they could help her

‘As soon Birmingham saw Lily’s notes, they promised they could help her and at least give her a better quality of life.’

Leeds General Infirmary has strongly denied ‘any suggestion’ that they ‘would act improperly either by restricting referrals or by failing to carry out surgery where either of these actions was the right thing to do’.
