Unions planning a summer of strikes pose a threat to the economy, the Tories warned today as the government prepared for a stand-off over public sector pay.

Unison, which has 1.3 million members, voted in favour of industrial action on July 10, boasting it could be the biggest walkout since the 1926 General Strike. 

A number of trade unions are seeking to mobilise their members to cause disruption this summer, with teachers, firefighters, tax officials, civil servants, railway workers and midwives considering industrial action. 

Public sector workers say their pay has been unfairly squeezed by spending cuts, but the government insists difficult decisions were needed to tackle the nation's debts

Unison today announced that its local government members backed action by 58 per cent in protest at a pay offer worth 1 per cent for most workers.

General secretary Dave Prentis, said: ‘We expect to be joined in that action by other unions in local government and will be campaigning amongst our members for maximum support on that day.

‘Many of our members are low paid women earning barely above the minimum wage, who care for our children, our elderly and our vulnerable and they deserve better treatment than they have had at the hands of this government.

‘The employers must get back into talks immediately to avoid a damaging dispute.’

Unison said local government workers have been 'condemned' to three consecutive years of pay freezes, followed by below-inflation rises in 2013 and 2014, leaving their pay reduced by almost 20 per cent since the coalition came to power.

But Conservative party chairman Grant Shapps told MailOnline: 'This strike is wrong. It will hurt hardworking people and families right across the country.

'The Government has had to take difficult decisions following Labour’s Great Recession.

'But now that we are starting to see those sacrifices pay off, with a real and steady economic recovery, it is galling that trade union bosses want to put that at risk.

'We haven’t heard a peep from Ed Miliband, of course. Ed Miliband is simply too weak to stand up to the trade union bosses who hold Labour’s purse strings – and too weak to represent the British people.'

The Local Government Association also condemned the move, adding: 'It is disappointing that Unison will be proceeding with strike action.

‘Local government staff have worked wonders while councils have been tackling the biggest funding cuts in living memory and we have no doubt that many will still be at work on the day of strike action.’

Unison is the first major union to announce strike action this week, with more expected within days.

The GMB and Unite will announce voting results over the next week, while the Public and Commercial Services union is also balloting its members for a strike in a long-running dispute over cuts in the civil service, with the result also due by the end of the month.

Members of the National Union of Teachers will also take industrial action on July 10, while firefighters in England and Wales have staged a series of walkouts over pensions over the past year and have not ruled out further stoppages.

Unison General Secretary Dave Prentis predicts walkouts on July 10 will be the biggest since the 1926 General Strike, but Tory party chairman Grant Shapps condemned the action for threatening the economic recovery

Midwives in England could soon be balloted for industrial action in protest at the Government's controversial decision not to accept a recommended 1 per cent across the board pay rise for NHS staff.

Thousands of midwives and maternity support staff are currently being consulted on whether they want a formal ballot for action.

Jon Skewes, director of policy and employment relations at the Royal College of Midwives, said: ‘Midwives are really angry that the Government said to them they'd get a 1% pay rise but now only staff at the top of their pay scales will get that rise, and it's not consolidated into their pay.

'Jeremy Hunt (the Health Secretary) has picked out health workers for harsher treatment on pay than anyone else in the public sector.

'This is the time for midwives to take a stand because the Government is intent on assaulting their pay and conditions.'

Other health unions are warning of ballots for industrial action, which could see a second wave of public sector strikes in in the autumn.

Civil servants at the Ministry of Justice and tax workers are also expected to take industrial action in the coming days in separate disputes over jobs and privatisation.

The Public and Commercial Services union said tens of thousands of HM Revenue and Customs staff across the UK will hold rolling strikes this week, including in Scotland and the North East today, Yorkshire and Humberside and Eastern England tomorrow, London, the South East and South West on Wednesday, Midlands and Northern Ireland on Thursday and North West England and Wales on Friday.

Mick Cash, acting general secretary of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union, also warned of a strike ballot among Network Rail workers in a row over spending cuts.

He told the union's annual conference in Bristol: 'We are talking about a ballot across the whole of Network Rail if cuts aren't stopped, a ballot that would include signallers, operations and the maintenance works on the infrastructure.

'We are being driven down that road by cash-led cuts, imposed by the Government, which threaten life and limb at a time of surging rail demand and while the private train companies are robbing the railways blind.’
