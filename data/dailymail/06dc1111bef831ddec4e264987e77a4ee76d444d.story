When Marianne Theresa Johnson-Reddick died last month, her children submitted an obituary to their local paper.

But instead of paying respects to their late mother, they exposed her as a serial abuser who subjected them to violence and torture throughout their lives.

The six offspring who have survived her published the scathing tribute in the Reno Gazette-Journal on September 10th, after she passed away at the end of August aged 78.

Scathing tribute: Marianne Theresa-Johnson Reddick's obituary published in the Reno Gazette-Journal

Life of torture: The children of Marianne Theresa-Johnson Reddick  said they were grateful she was dead. She died on August 30, 2013 (not September 20 as stated in the published piece)

Her family said they can now 'live the rest of their lives with the peace' and called for a 'war' against child abusers in the United States.

The submission read: 'Marianne Theresa Johnson-Reddick born Jan 4, 1935 and died alone on Aug. 30, 2013.

'She is survived by her 6 of 8 children whom she spent her lifetime torturing in every way possible. While she neglected and abused her small children, she refused to allow anyone else to care or show compassion towards them.

'When they became adults she stalked and tortured anyone they dared to love. Everyone she met, adult or child was tortured by her cruelty and exposure to violence, criminal activity, vulgarity, and hatred of the gentle or kind human spirit.

'On behalf of her children whom she so abrasively exposed to her evil and violent life, we celebrate her passing from this earth and hope she lives in the after-life reliving each gesture of violence, cruelty, and shame that she delivered on her children.

'Her surviving children will now live the rest of their lives with the peace of knowing their nightmare finally has some form of closure.

'Most of us have found peace in helping those who have been exposed to child abuse and hope this message of her final passing can revive our message that abusing children is unforgiveable, shameless, and should not be tolerated in a 'humane society'.

'Our greatest wish now, is to stimulate a national movement that mandates a purposeful and dedicated war against child abuse in the United States of America.'

Lifetime of abuse: The obituary said everyone Johnson-Reddick met was 'tortured by her cruelty and exposure to violence'

Neglect: One of the final paragraph of the obituary reads, 'On behalf of her children whom she so abrasively exposed to her evil and violent life'

A news report on MyNews4.com confirmed the obituary said she died on September 30th but The Washoe County Public 
Guardianâ€™s office in Nevada has made it clear she died a month earlier.

John F. Maher the Gazette-Journal's publisher said the obituary had been paid for and was sent in through an online self-service portal self-service.

He added: 'We've removed the online listing of this obituary as we continue our review of the circumstances surrounding its placement.

'Once we've completed our review, we'll determine what, if any, further actions are required.'

No one had signed her guest book before the post was taken down.
