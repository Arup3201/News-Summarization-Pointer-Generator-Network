She's known for her olive-hued skin and lustrous hair, and now Michelle Keegan has been named as the face - and body - of a new self-tan range. 

On the first day of spring, Michelle, 27, has been announced as the new spokesmodel for Garnier Ambre Solaire No Streaks Bronzer Self Tan range.

And the regular self-tanner admitted she's delighted to make her faux glow habits official.

She said: ‘Garnier Ambre Solaire has been my favourite go to self-tanner for years as it takes care of my skin while providing a natural looking tan with a healthy glow.'

'It’s easy to use and is available in a range of shades and formats, there really is something for anyone who is after a sun-kissed streak free tan.

‘To become a spokesmodel for Garnier Ambre Solaire is an honour. 

'Garnier is a brand that I’ve grown up with and I’ve always admired it's tag line of "take care."

'It’s in line with my own values of taking care of myself with a healthy lifestyle inside and out with innovative skincare products.'

Michelle will appear on pack and in store advertising for the Garnier Ambre Solaire No Streaks Bronzer Self Tan Body Mist and Face Mist nationwide from 1 May, and Garnier Summerbody Moisturising Lotion exclusively at Superdrug.

Having recently launched her summer Lipsy range, the star spoke about how important looking good was to her and how she takes a 'less is more' approach to make-up.  

She told FEMAIL: 'Keep a fresh-faced feel,' she said. 'With day wear make-up, you can always add to it later in the evening. 

'In the summer, I wear much less make-up and it looks better on your skin.'

Her beauty regime is fairly minimal and she simply cleanses, tones and moisturises every day and treats herself to a facial every other week to rehydrate her skin.

She swears by Simple face wipes, Origins cleanser and Garnier and Kiehl's moisturisers.

The pint-sized star also emphasises the importance of exuding confidence. She said: 'If you’re feeling unsure about anything you’re wearing, ditch it. You’ll feel out of sorts all day if you don’t give your entire outfit a thumbs-up.'

Body-wise, Michelle says she tries to work out as much as possible and while there's 'always an excuse not to go', she ends up feeling better after a workout.

'I try and go to the gym as much as I can,' she said. 'It could be three times a week or not at all one week, but I don't punish myself if I don't go.' 

Michelle has recently finished filming on her new TV show, Ordinary Lies, her first major role since quitting ITV soap Coronation Street.

The actress used to play Tina McIntyre on Corrie's cobbles but has switched allegiances to the BBC where she'll portray car showroom receptionist Tracy in the new six-part series. 

She also recently showed off her tan in her new Lipsy campaign imagery - and her next drop of affordable fashion will be hitting stores in April.
