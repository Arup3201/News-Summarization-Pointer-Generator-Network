Pioneer: Female baseball star Doris Sams was a five-time All Star player during her eight-year career

Doris Sams, the pioneering women's baseball star who inspired a hit Hollywood film, has died aged 85.

Sams, a leading player in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in the 1940s and 50s, passed away on Thursday following a three-year battle with Alzheimers.

The women's baseball pioneer, a five-time All Star in her eight-year professional career, also inspired the 1992 Tom Hanks film A League of Their Own.

Sams, also called Sammye, played for the Muskegon Lassies, and later the Kalamazoo Lassies.

She made the circuit's honor team in 1947 and from 1949 through 1952. She averaged more than .300 during each of her last four seasons.

One sportswriter called her 'calm and cool at all times.'

'Sammye is the tempering force of the team,' Muskegon Chronicle sportswriter James F. Henderson wrote at the time. 'Where another might become ruffled, she maintains a placid demeanor.'

Sams played for the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, the brainchild of Major League team owners Philip Wrigley and Branch Rickey as a wartime diversion, and they paid some 600 women players between $45 and $75 a game, according to the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, New York.

Their salary was several times what the mostly working-class players could make in jobs traditionally reserved for women, author Barbara Gregorich wrote in her book, 'Women at Play.'

Wrigley reasoned that, if women could be used to build ships and aircraft, they could also be used to fill the nation's ballparks while male players were at war, Sharon Roepke wrote in her book 'Diamond Gals.'

'The women ballplayers would serve as inspirational examples to further the 'manpower' mobilization,' Roepke wrote.

Respected: Sams was known by sportswriters for being 'cool and calm at all times'

'In addition to playing ball they would raise money for war bonds, develop youth programs and visit service hospitals.'

The 1992 movie 'A League of Their Own' featured actor Tom Hanks as the heavy-drinking team manager depressed about coaching women. After making one player cry, he memorably said, 'There's no crying in baseball.'

The women's league's teams were coached by men.

Hanks' players included the fiercely competitive Dottie Hinson (played by Geena Davis) and the rebellious, gum-chewing Mae Mordabito (Madonna).

Though the film is widely thought to have been directly inspired by the career of wartime baseball star Dottie Collins, players like Doris Sams who blazed a trail as the first superstar female baseball players in the 1940s were also said to be inspiration for the film, which was nominated for two Golden Globes.

The Stevens Mortuary Chapel in Knoxville said Sams died Thursday and her funeral service was Sunday.

Despite all her honors, Sams remained humble.

In a 1997 interview, she said her perfect game 'wasn't so perfect.'

'They hit me like a drum,' she said. 'But it was one of those days when everybody was on their toes. They were catching line drives. You know, the pitcher doesn't do it alone, let's face it.

'They caught line drives and everything else â€” just unreasonable catches that day.'

Friends also recalled a somewhat shy Sams.

Legacy: Sams was one of the players who inspired the 1992 film A League of Their Own, starring Tom Hanks and Geena Davis (pictured), though none of the characters were based on her directly.

Frances Rader, who had known Sams since childhood, told The Knoxville News Sentinel that when producers of the 1992 movie 'A League of Their Own' wanted Sams to help promote it, she declined because she didn't want to be in the spotlight.

Sams' 88-year-old cousin says her legacy will continue to shine.

'She made women more a part of public sports,' Gordon Sams told the newspaper. 'She was an interesting lady and I hope she will never be forgotten.'
