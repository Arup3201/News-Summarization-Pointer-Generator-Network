Sun worshippers were rejoicing today after it was revealed the hot weather Britain has been enjoying over the past few days could last into the weekend.

Temperatures will temporarily dip today and tomorrow to the low 20s, before soaring again on Friday - possibly holding up until Sunday.

London was expected to see the best of the sweltering temperatures across the UK yesterday, while the north of England was also climbing to around 28C.

This meant the top half of the country was finally enjoying the same highs as the south after averaging around 24C over the past few days.

The weekend of glorious weather continued as people returned to work Monday, with a high of 29.6C recorded in Lee-On-Solent in Hampshire.

This was just shy of the 29.7C reached in Bournemouth on Sunday, which marked the hottest day of the year so far. 

However, it was markedly cooler across the North Sea coast of England and Scotland, where Donna Nook in Lincolnshire peaked at only 16C.

Yesterday afternoon's 28C summer hotspots were said by BBC Weather to be the Solent; Durham; Strathallan, Perthshire; and Derrylin, Northern Ireland.

Strathallan got up to 28.4C, making it Scotland's warmest day this year, the Met Office said.

While the sunshine is not unusual for July it is above average, said Andy Ratcliffe, meteorologist for MeteoGroup.

‘In the middle part of the week the weather will get cooler but still warm, to around the low 20s,’ he added.

‘But it will pick up again in time for the weekend and should last through to Sunday.

‘Past that it is hard to be certain, but we don’t have much rain at all forecast for the next seven-to-10 days.’

Broadcast meteorologist Chris Fawkes said on Twitter: 'Heatwave continues for many for another good week plus. Highest temperatures to hit low 30Cs.'

But police have warned of the dangers of cooling off in open water after a 17-year-old boy died while swimming in a lake at an old quarry.

Russell O’Neill, of Worcester, had been swimming at Gullet Quarry near Malvern in Worcestershire when he failed to resurface on Saturday afternoon.

The teenager’s body was recovered by a dive team from South Wales Police at 4.50pm. West Mercia Police were not treating his death as suspicious.

Meanwhile, researchers have linked soaring temperatures and a rise in the number of emergency admissions for accidental injury among children.

As the mercury climbs, more and more youngsters are admitted to hospital because of accidents, according to healthcare data analysts CHKS.

Researchers examined hospital data concerning children who were admitted between January 2010 and March 2013 for conditions such as arm breaks.
