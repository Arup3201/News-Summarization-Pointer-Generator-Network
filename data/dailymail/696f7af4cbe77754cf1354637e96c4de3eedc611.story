Paris Saint-Germain have allowed midfielder Adrien Rabiot to open talks with Arsenal, according to French media.

Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has been tracking the French youth international's development and has reportedly informed Rabiot personally of his interest.

The French champions have set an asking price of £5.6million for the 19-year-old, but Arsenal face competition for his signature from Juventus and AS Roma.

Rabiot is currently contracted to PSG until 2015, but has been unable to strike a new deal with Laurent Blanc's side.

Wenger may be looking to sure up his midfield after his side scraped to a 2-1 opening day win against Crystal Palace on Saturday thanks to a last-gasp winner from Aaron Ramsey. 

Gunners midfielder Jack Wilshere was criticised by Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp for a lackluster performance at the Emirates.

Redknapp told Sky Sports: 'Jack Wilshere's problem is Jack Wilshere. He's not performing. He's got to take games by the scruff of the neck like two years ago - there's no excuses anymore.

'It's nothing to do with smoking. I played with better players who smoked. I think he's competing with Ozil for a place because Ramsey will always score more goals.'
