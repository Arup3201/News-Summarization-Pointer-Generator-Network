Sometimes the simple things in life can bring the most pleasure, as a new video shows.

Mark Ammann, 57, from Texas was wandering through Walmart on Tuesday afternoon when he heard something strange drifting over the airwaves.

When he went to investigate, he caught a group of children having great fun singing the national anthem into a row of home cooler fans.

Footage shows the young singers lost in the moment as they chime away.

Even when they forget the words, they continue to keep the melody going.

The air being blasted from the fans causes the sound to muffle.

All of a sudden a boy comes along with a grocery cart and points to Ammann filming.

One girl runs away giggling in embarrassment.

Despite losing one member, the other two chorus members continue to sing at the top of their lungs.

Ammann later uploaded the heartwarming footage to Facebook, along with the caption: 'What's wrong with today's youth? Not a dang thing.'

He later added: 'Yes, I did capture this candid moment today at Walmart. No, it wasn't staged and I don't know the kids involved. 

'I was walking through the store and heard the singing and got my phone out to record it.

'I think we could use more sharing of stuff like this that a lot of the other junk I see posted lately.' 

Many viewers have echoed Ammann's sentiments.

'Makes my heart happy! Thanks for sharing!' one commenter wrote, while another added: 'Love this! Almost brought a tear to my eye.'
