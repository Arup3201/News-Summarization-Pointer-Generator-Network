Arsenal are exploring numerous options to help fans get home from their FA Cup quarter-final after TV schedulers announced their glamour tie against Manchester United will be on a Monday night.

The Gunners will take on Louis van Gaal’s side at Old Trafford on Monday March 9, which is set to cause travel problems for the away Arsenal fans, with an evening kick-off time of 7.45pm.

All four FA Cup quarter-finals will be broadcast live on TV, with the BBC and BT Sport sharing the ties.

‘In the wake of this announcement, the club is exploring a number of options to help our travelling supporters get back to London afterwards,’ said a statement on Arsenal’s website.

‘No return trains are currently timetabled and we will let supporters know the proposed travel plans as soon as possible.’

The Old Trafford FA Cup tie is set to finish at just after 9.30pm, meaning Arsenal fans would miss the final train from Manchester Piccadilly to London Euston at 9.15pm. 

In order to make that train fans would have to leave the ground well before full-time or would face a 199 mile drive back to London (The Emirates Stadium), which on average takes four hours. In addition even if fans did leave early and catch the 9.15pm train, they could miss the last Underground trains on certain tube lines in London.

Arsenal Supporters' Trust spokesman Tim Payton said: ‘One of the magic things of the FA Cup is the large away fan allocation but the Football Association are damaging their own competition. They are sullying the brand of the cup.

‘The football authorities need to explain why with four quarter-finals we can’t play two on Saturday and two on Sunday. This is another example of broadcasters and their money dictating to the inconvenience of fans.

‘Broadcasters should remember, without fans at the ground there would be no atmosphere for them to show.’

Arsenal Supporters' Trust are demanding that the club and the FA help to cut their costs.

Payton added: ’We are calling on the FA and Arsenal to subsidise travel to the game and have reasonably-priced match tickets.

‘We are already working with other Arsenal fan groups on the issue of broadcasted games. With £5billion about to flow into football it really is time that fans are put first.’

The quarter-final action begins at 12.45pm on Saturday 7 March with Bradford City taking on Reading, live on BT Sport.

Later that day West Brom make a quick trip to Villa Park to take on Tim Sherwood’s Aston Villa which will be broadcast by the BBC.

On Sunday March 8, with an evening kick-off of 4pm, BT Sport will take their cameras to Anfield for Blackburn’s visit to Liverpool.

Finally, the mouth-watering prospect of Manchester United against Arsenal will conclude the quarter-final action, before the winners get set for semi-final ties at Wembley.
