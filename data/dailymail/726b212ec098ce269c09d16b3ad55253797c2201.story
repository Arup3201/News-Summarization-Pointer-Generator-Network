Legendary former England skipper Mike Brearley wants captains to halt abusive sledging and aggressive gestures at the World Cup.

David Warner’s spat with India batsman Rohit Sharma on Sunday — when the Australian repeatedly screamed at Sharma to ‘speak English’ — was the latest piece of boorish on-field behaviour and now Brearley is calling on captains such as England’s Eoin Morgan to tell players to cut out the verbals.

Brearley wields considerable influence as chairman of the International Cricket Council’s world cricket committee. And ECB president Giles Clarke, as well as Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland, have agreed to put the idea on the agenda for the ICC meeting on January 28-29.

If the ICC agree, an edict could come in before the World Cup starts in Melbourne on February 14, when England meet Australia. Sin-bins are also being considered.

Brearley said: ‘It comes down to respect, for the umpires, the opposition, the viewers and one’s own team. I hate the sneering and mocking and the curled lip, as much as what is said, or what is done in terms of action.

‘This is a good time to remind people of the Play Hard, Play Fair Spirit of Cricket motto, both because Phillip Hughes’s shocking death should make people rethink their values and because of the World Cup. The important thing is that people are consistent and, if given out, they leave the arena promptly and get on with the game quickly.’

The ICC are considering tougher sanctions and Clarke said: ‘The CEOs plan to have Geoff Allardice, the head of cricket, brief referees and umpires. They will be told zero tolerance for bad behaviour and it is their job to enforce that.’

Warner was unhappy after India took a single when when he felt the ball deflected off Sharma's pads

BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew was criticised by Australia players Chris Rogers and Xavier Doherty for linking Hughes’s death with flashpoints in the recent Australia-India series. But seven players have been punished in the last month including Warner, MS Dhoni, Virat Kohli and Ishant Sharma.

Agnew said: ‘I am not critical of Michael Clarke but the posturing and unnecessary gesturing appeared to be as bad as ever in the last series.

‘The ICC plan to bring in strict anti-sledging regulations in time for the World Cup, but it is a shame the players have not felt prompted to act themselves.’

David Gower, the former England skipper, said: ‘Asking the captains to hold fire is a good idea but we’ll have to look at the small print. You have to find the balance between what is acceptable and what isn’t.’

Sharma and Warner were separated by the umpires after tempers flared between the pair

Certainly foul abuse on the field flies in the face of the Corinthian spirit that cricket is supposed to uphold. Australia captain Clarke acknowledged as much when he made his heart-wrenching address at the funeral of Hughes.

Clarke said: ‘His spirit, which is now part of the game for ever, will act as a custodian of the sport we all love. We must listen to it. We must cherish it. We must learn from it.’

Unfortunately, a cult has emerged in this most gentlemanly of sports. It gives bowlers licence to charge down the pitch, arms waving, before stopping a yard from the bemused batsman and shouting ‘f*** off!’

When England’s Jim Laker took the final wicket in his incredible haul of 19 for 90 against Australia at Old Trafford in 1956, he turned and took his sweater from the umpire, then walked off without histrionics. I used to write his column in the Daily Sketch and he explained: ‘Well, that’s how we did it then.’

I’ve played cricket with Giles Clarke, for the Forty Club which has 2,400 members who pass on the message of sportsmanship and fair play to schools.

I suggested to him it might be a good idea to persuade the international captains, the boards, the MCC and the ECB to call a halt to abusive behaviour. They could call it the Phillip Hughes Declaration or Accord.

Clarke said my idea was ‘firmly on the agenda at the next ICC meeting’. He promises zero tolerance in the World Cup but will it last? Australia have always bred strong characters who love sports and hate losing.

They love provoking the opposition, particularly the English, through word and action.

Gideon Haigh, the eminent Australian cricket writer, believes sledging has become more barbed as a result of the high stakes in the Indian Premier League.

He said ‘Administrators and the media have an ambivalent relationship with on-field aggression. They affect to deplore it but in truth they know it sells.’

And, frankly, the ECB have been allowing their cricketers, England fast bowler Jimmy Anderson especially, to run amok.

The ICC have 10 full members, 38 associate members and 57 affiliated countries, almost half of the world, and they expect a billion television viewers to watch the World Cup final in Melbourne on March 29.

How many of these will be turned off by watching what Agnew calls ‘the verbal abuse, the posturing and the unnecessary gesturing which appeared to be as bad as ever (in the recent Australia-India series)’?

One stroke — not a hook or a cut but a common sense consensus — could stop this nonsense in a trice. The laws say the captain is responsible for the behaviour of his players, so speak up Michael Clarke, Eoin Morgan and the rest!
