A Colorado city is promising to revise its swimsuit rules after a Muslim woman was turned away from its recreation center pool for wearing an Islamic dress over a shirt and pants.

Saba Ali said that she offered to just wear the shirt and pants to swim on Sunday but was denied.

Commerce City spokeswoman Michelle Halstead says street clothes aren't allowed in the pool because they can increase the likelihood of contamination and waterborne illness.

A deeply upset Mrs Ali told ABC7: 'Why do I have to be half-naked to swim? To enjoy my time with my kids?' 

The mother rented a hotel room so that she could swim with her children in a private pool. 

Ms Halsted said that full body swimsuits and rash guards used by surfers and scuba divers are allowed at the Commerce City recreation center. 

The city official said that the staff were not being discriminatory but would also turn away people who wore jean shorts or sports shorts to swim. 

However Mrs Ali said that she has worn the same outfit to a public pool before without being prevented from swimming.  

The city will update its swimwear brochure to include burkinis - loose fitting full-body swimsuits with a hood made for Islamic women.

MailOnline was awaiting a statement today from the Commerce City authorities.  

Saba Ali was banned from swimming in her traditional dress at the Commerce City pool because her street clothes could contaminate the pool, officials said
