Jonny Wilkinson's 17-year career ended in glory on Saturday night when he kicked 15 points to help Toulon to an 18-10 victory over Castres in the Top 14 final at the Stade  de France.

And the World Cup winner delivered a trademark drop goal as a fitting reminder of his most famous kick which earned England success against Australia in 2003.

Wilkinson last night landed the drop goal to go alongside three penalty goals in the first half and one after the interval.

Toulon’s final points came from Delon Armitage after Wilkinson decided the kick was out of his range.

This
 success completes a magnificent final season for the 35-year-old as 
Toulon, the club he joined from Newcastle in 2009, also won the Heineken
 Cup last week, against Saracens, in Cardiff.

A
 ferocious first half was dominated by the kicking of Wilkinson whose 
three penalty goals and that drop goal had edged Toulon into a 12-10 
lead.

Castres had little possession and only kept in touch thanks to a try off a counter-attack led by Scotland wing Max Evans.

Evans started and finished the move in the 11th minute which put Castres ahead after Wilkinson’s opening penalty goal.

The
 try also caused the match to erupt as Armitage, the Toulon full-back, 
and Castres’ lead player Rory Kockott had a scuffle after Evans had 
grabbed the ball to touch down.

Kockott added the conversion, but he later missed three penalty goal attempts in contrast to the perfection of Wilkinson.

A tetchy and nervous second half produced a penalty for Wilkinson and the late kick from Armitage.

Wilkinson
 will join Toulon’s coaching staff next season, but he admits he is 
unsure of how he will feel about ending his playing days.

‘That’s
 the unknown for me, that’s the difficult bit — not really knowing if 
I’m looking forward to it,’ he said in the build-up to the final in 
Paris.

In honour of Wilkinson, ‘God Save The Queen’ was played over the public address system when the final whistle went.

Wilkinson said: ‘It’s impossible to say how I feel. I never thought when I joined Toulon we would have such success.’
