An emergency fund to pay for new cancer drugs is to be extended after the NHS’s rationing body failed to clear any medicines sent for approval in the past year.

David Cameron will announce the extension of a £200million annual budget that is used to pay for treatments denied to NHS patients by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).

There are growing calls for fundamental reform of NICE, which is blamed for unfairly blocking drugs it deems poor value for money and taking too long to reach its decisions.

The Cancer Drugs Fund, which began in April 2011, has led to 34,000 patients in England getting drugs they were refused on the NHS. It was due to expire in March but the Prime Minister will announce a two-year extension during the Conservative Party conference in Manchester next week.

A research project to help understand which treatments and drugs will be effective will sequence the DNA code of 3,000 cancer patients.

‘When I became Prime Minister three years ago many patients with rare cancers were being denied lifesaving treatments,’ Mr Cameron said.

‘That is why we created the Cancer Drugs Fund, it is why we are extending it, and it is why we are partnering with Cancer Research UK to conduct new research into the effectiveness of cancer drugs.’

Mother-of-two Nikki Phelps fought an NHS decision to deny her the life-prolonging drug sunitinib

Almost two-thirds of cancer treatments considered by NICE are rejected. This year, of the 11 new cancer medicines put to it, not one has been approved for NHS use.

Since 2007 NICE has recommended only 31 per cent of new medicines it reviewed.

Medics and drugs firms say the Cancer Drugs Fund was meant as a temporary stop gap, and without a more fundamental shake-up of Nice there will be a return to the days when patients had to ‘beg’ for life-prolonging drugs on the NHS.

NICE says it is not worthwhile to fund drugs that can extend life for a few weeks or months but cost tens of thousands of pounds per patient, and the money would be better spent on other treatments.

Critics say UK patients are being denied the most effective drugs even though many are invented in Britain, while NHS doctors miss out on the experience of working with breakthrough treatments.

Others say NICE might reject a treatment on the grounds that it extends patients’ lives by an average of only a few weeks even though it helps some live for several years.

Those who suffered as a result include mother-of-two Nikki Phelps – who fought an NHS decision to deny her the life-prolonging drug sunitinib.

After a campaign backed by the Daily Mail, NHS chiefs finally agreed to supply the £100-a-day drug. But Mrs Phelps, 37, from Gravesend, Kent, who had glandular cancer, died two weeks later.

Jonathan Emms, UK managing director of Pfizer, said: ‘NICE is blocking medicines when it should be a beacon for innovation. The Cancer Drugs Fund is a short-term fix which needs to exist because NICE doesn’t work.’

Dr Andrew Protheroe, a cancer consultant at the Churchill Hospital in Oxford, welcomed the extension of the Cancer Drugs Fund.

‘There is nothing more frustrating than knowing there is an effective, licensed, evidence-based treatment available which I am not allowed to use,’ he said.

Sir Andrew Dillon, NICE’s chief executive, said: ‘NICE guidance on new cancer drugs provides the basis for informed decisions to be taken by clinicians and patients, and by making clear when drugs work well in routine practice, it helps the NHS allocate the money it has available fairly and efficiently.

‘NHS organisations have always been able to consider exceptions to our guidance. The Cancer Drugs Fund provides a national resource to meet the cost of those exceptions.

'NICE cancer drugs guidance helps to make sure that the Fund is used only where exceptions to our recommendations on routine practice really will work in the interests of patients.’

One of the drugs rejected by NICE was the breast cancer treatment Afinitor, also known as everolimus, which costs about £36,000 a time.

The watchdog said the drug was not ‘cost effective’ and there was no evidence it was better than treatments already available.

But trials have shown it can stop tumours spreading for nearly eight months – twice as long as alternative drugs. Manufacturer Novartis believes up to 14,000 women a year with advanced breast cancer could benefit.

In May, NICE rejected Avastin (bevacizumab) for ovarian cancer claiming it was ‘not the best use of taxpayers’ money’.

This was despite trials showing that patients given this drug – which costs £25,000 a time – alongside chemotherapy lived 50 per cent longer, surviving just over a year on average.

The treatment is now one of the most commonly-applied for from the Cancer Drugs Fund.

In March, NICE turned down Inlyta (axitinib) for kidney cancer, even though it helped some patients live an extra three years.

The drug – which costs £3,000 a month – could potentially help 6,000 sufferers a year.
