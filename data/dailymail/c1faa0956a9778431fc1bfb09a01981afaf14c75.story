Bubbly: Aldi's cut-price champagne has beaten a number of other more expensive bottles in a prestigious blind taste test

A bottle of Aldi bubbly which costs just £12.99 has beaten some of the world's most renowned champagnes in a blind taste test.

The cut-price supermarket drink was voted by experts as better than other bottles, some of which were ten times more expensive.

Judges at a leading food and wine competition described Aldi's Champagne Veuve Monsigny by Philizot and Fils as 'classy and complex'.

It was said to offer an intense nose of baked apple, brioche and stone fruits with gorgeous flavours of apples, red fruit and minerality on the palate.

The French bottle - on Aldi's own label - was awarded a silver medal at the prestigious International Wine Challenge 2013.

The champagne was said to be better than many other typically posh bottles, including Veuve Clicquot La Grande Dame 2004, which costs £130.

Another of the beaten contenders included Moet and Chandon Imperial NV, which is priced at £32.99.

Aldi spokesman Tony Baines said: 'We believe good quality and value are not mutually exclusive and these award wins support that belief.

'You don't need to pay superstar prices for super quality drinks.

'We'll be raising a glass of our Champagne Veuve Monsigny by Philizot and Fils to toast our success.

'We hope our customers will enjoy doing the same the next time they have a cause to celebrate.'

The competition sees each medal wine tasted on at least three separate occasions by a minimum of ten of the finest wine tasters in the world.

Last month Aldi was celebrating after its £10 bottle of gin beat some of the world's most highly-regarded spirits, which cost up to five times as much, in a blind taste test by adjudicators at the International Spirits Challenge.

It was awarded a silver medal in the competition, the same as The London No.1 Gin, which sells for £35 at Harrods.

The budget Aldi £9.65 Oliver Cromwell London Dry Gin has sold in the supermarket since 1999.

It comes in 70cl bottles and is described as having a 'ripe, citrus aroma with rounded spice and a touch of juniper'.

It is the only Aldi own label gin and is distilled for a 'clear, crisp, complex flavour'.

The Worship Street Whistling Shop Cream Gin, which costs £55.95, also won silver.

But mainstream brands such as Bombay Sapphire, selling for £21.70, and Hendricks, at  £26.39, only won bronze.

A panel of six judges which is made up of selected master distillers, blenders, specialist writers and prominent industry figures carried out blind taste tests on 70 different gins over the course of a day.

The ISC is founded on a rigorous and objective blind tasting process, by panels of selected master distillers, blenders, specialist writers and prominent industry figures – all acknowledged experts in their field.
