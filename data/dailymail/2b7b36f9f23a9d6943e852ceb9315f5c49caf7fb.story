A murder investigation has been launched after the bones of a homeless woman were found washed up on a remote island.

The remains of Angela Millington from Southend, were discovered on Foulness Island, Essex, on June 21.

It is not known how long the body had been there but the homeless 33-year-old was identified following forensic and DNA tests - and police now believe she was murdered.

The last confirmed sighting of Miss Millington was almost a year ago.

Detective Chief Inspector Simon Werrett, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said: 'We have launched a murder investigation as we don't know what happened to Angela.

'We are keeping all lines of enquiry open. Anyone with any information, no matter how small, could help us to discover how Angela died and bring her justice.'

Ms Millington had no fixed address and was last been seen alive when she visited a housing officer in Westcliff on November 21.

She also withdrew money from her bank account that day and her mobile phone has not been used since the end of that month.

Mr Werrett added: 'We have not found any of her clothing or belongings.

The remains of Ms Millington were found on the marshes of Foulness Island in Essex. Expert reports indicate she did not die there but was either taken there or her body was carried there by the tide 

'Angela was known to associate with street drinkers and local homeless people.

'There was a sighting of her by a police officer in the Porters Grange area of Southend on January 6 but we have no definite details of her movements since November 21.

'The expert reports indicate that she did not die on Foulness but was either taken there or the body was carried there in the tide.'

The ramblers initially found a collection of bones as they walked in a salt marsh area along the island's south east coastline.

They called police and a full search found further parts of the skeleton.

Detectives have been supporting her family and speaking to people who knew her to try and find out how and when she died, Essex Police said. 

Gary Turner of the Homeless Action Resource Project (HARP) said Miss Millington had used the service intermittently before last being seen at the centre about a year ago.

Police and forensic experts were seen examining the crime scene on Foulness Island today 

Mr Turner said she was not a regular enough user of the charity to be well-known to staff but expressed sadness at her death.

He said: 'The last contact we had with Angela was a year ago, when she popped into one of our sites for a bite to eat and, prior to that, her contact was quite sporadic.

'She wasn’t someone who was a regular user of our services or received key work from a member of staff but it seems she had mental health issues and possibly some substance misuse or addiction issues.

'She had an issue around accommodation, or lack of, and often when people stop accessing our services there’s a natural assumption they have sorted things out and don’t need us anymore.

'But it’s always a sorry thing to hear someone has lost their life, however that may be, particularly someone so young.' 

Roger Burroughs, chairman of Foulness Parish Council, said it was not unheard of for bodies to wash up on the island though, because of the tight security on the island, residents were not always informed.

Mr Burroughs, 69, said: 'We weren't informed of this particular case but it's the kind of thing that Kinetic Security take over because of the nature of the site, so we wouldn't be privy to the information unless they wanted to tell us on the council.

'We've had this situation before, though, where people have washed up or been found and two or three years ago there was a male body washed up.' 

Anybody with information is asked to contact police on 01702 470173 during office hours or 101 outside of those times.

Foulness Island is a large expanse of marshland separated from the mainland by a large number of creeks.

Little over 200 people live on the island, which is mainly farmland and has 30 sites of special scientific interest (SSSI) due to its habitat for flocking wild birds, flora and fauna.

There are seven working farms on the site spanning 7,000 acres between them.

The island is run by QinetiQ on behalf of the Ministry of Defence and visitors have to gain authorisation to be able to access the land from Shoebury.

It was first used by the military in 1858 when the British School of Gunnery was opened.

The MOD describes it as an 'unrivalled and unique UK facility for critical military test, evaluation and training activities'.
