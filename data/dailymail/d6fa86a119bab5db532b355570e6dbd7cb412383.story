Counter-terrorism experts have warned the threat of homegrown jihadists is growing as more Islamic extremists, like Khaled Sharrouf, take to social media to spread their ideologies.

A spike in supporters for terror group Islamic State in Australia and posts relating to extremist views is a cause for concern, according to experts.

It comes as it emerges the Federal Government has cut welfare payments to more than a dozen Australians who are thought to be fighting for terrorism group in the Middle East.

The Sydney Morning Herald reported shocking photos and aggressive threats made on social media sites, like Twitter, was drawing a fervent following.

The latest of these posts are a threat against a Muslim doctor who spoke out against Sharrouf and another jihadist Mohamed Elomar and an image of Sharrouf's son holding a severed head.

Posted underneath these taunts are messages of support for the jihadists from Sydney, and have spawned messages of support online.

One of them was from a physical education teacher residing in Punchbowl who wrote on Facebook accompanied by pictures of Sharrouf: 'He was a good brother the area surely misses him.'

While a personal trainer from Birrong launched a more worrying attack on the Australian Federal Police and the Abbott Government.

'F*kn dogs these Aussie police and this f***ed uop law with the f***ed up government that sucks Americas [sic] d***,' they wrote.

Despite the rise in online chatter from jihad supporters, Australia's security threat level has not shifted from 'medium' - meaning an attack could happened - and counter-terrorism experts say the most significant concern facing the nation is a 'lone-wolf' attack.

These types of attacks are similar to the Boston bombings or the attack on British soldier Lee Rigby who was hacked to death, according to Global Terrorism Research's Greg Barton.

'If they’ve got the savvy to plan something quietly without telling their mates, they may well pull something off,' he told Fairfax Media.

'I think we just have to accept that we might be lucky and not see that happen but there’s certainly enough intent and serious association that someone in this larger network might try to do something.'

Meanwhile the Federal Government has stopped welfare payments to more than a dozen Australians who are suspected of terrorism activity in the Middle East, according to The Daily Telegraph.

In July, it was reveal Khaled Sharrouf was still receiving a disability pension worth $383-a-week at least two months after he fled Australia for the Middle East on his brother's passport in December.

The Federal Government believes there are about 150 Australians travelling to the Middle East to join up with extremist groups with 'tens of people' who had already returned to Australian shores from fighting alongside suspected terrorist organisations.

A spokeswoman for Social Services Minister Kevin Andrews confirmed to The Daily Telegraph that the 'a number of individuals' who resided overseas had their welfare payments stopped, and repeated the government's commitment to cracking down on Australians who are involved in extremist activities benefiting from taxpayers' money.

It is now looking at introducing more legislation to combat this issue, including people travelling to areas where terror groups are operating to justify their trips.

This comes as a Muslim doctor who spoke out against Australian terrorists Khaled Sharrouf and Mohamed Elomar has been the target of threatening tweets from a Twitter account believed associated with Elomar on Wednesday morning.

Twitter account 'Abu Hafs ozzie', which shares a similar username to ones previously used by the terrorist, tweeted on Wednesday: 'Anyone in Sydney who can give me the details of Habashi dog Dr Jamal Rifi, anything, house details, wat (sic) area am willing to pay $1,000.

'Any details were he works or knows if his got kids which school they attend. Like I said I am willing to pay $1000 just for details.'

But Dr Rifi told Daily Mail Australia this morning he would not be afraid.

'Their actions shouldn't instil fear among us to the point where that fear will paralyse us,' he said.

'And that's why I would refuse to be fearful of their threats'.

Dr Rifi made a number of public statements yesterday where he denounced the actions of the Australian terrorists.

His condemnation followed Khaled Sharrouf releasing an image of his seven-year-old son holding a decapitated head in the Syrian city of Raqqa at the weekend.

'What we saw to be honest, (is) very disturbing, especially when it's done in the name of Islam,' Dr Rifi said.

'And it can only be done by a very sick person'.

Dr Rifi, a prominent member of Sydney's Islamic community, was a finalist in the 2009 Australian Local Hero awards.

He said he was familiar with Khaled Sharrouf's father but had never met the younger Sharrouf who has turned to terrorism.

The Sydney-based doctor has played an instrumental part in forging positive relationships between the Muslim and wider Australian communities. 

He was a founding member of Muslim Doctors Against Violence and the Christian Muslim Friendship Society.

Dr Rifi helped recruit and train Muslim youth as surf lifesavers at Cronulla beach following riots in the Sydney shire suburb in 2005.

Daily Mail Australia approached NSW Police for comment.
