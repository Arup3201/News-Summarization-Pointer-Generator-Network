Politicians and union bosses united today to condemn the treatment of the 3,000 BAE staff who lost their jobs as 'a disgrace'.

After days of speculation in the media, staff were finally informed of the job losses this morning in a ten-minute meeting with senior management.

The biggest job cuts will be at sites in Warton and Samlesbury in Lancashire and at Brough in East Yorkshire.

Losses: Tory MP David Davis speaks outside BAE in Brough, East Yorkshire as two workers leave the plant after being told by management 3,000 jobs are to go

Speaking outside the BAE plant in 
Brough where 900 people lost their jobs, former home secretary Alan 
Johnson, who is Labour MP for West Hull and Hessle, said: 'They have had
terrible news, delivered in the most terrible way.'

Standing
beside him, Tory MP David Davis added: 'They are an outstanding 
workforce - low cost, efficient and worth fighting for.' 

Both politicians expressed their dismay that the majority of jobs that were lost belonged to highly-skilled engineers.

Both politicians expressed their dismay that the majority of jobs that were lost belonged to highly-skilled engineers. 

Explaining the firm's decision Ian King, chief executive of BAE 
Systems, said the company needed to maintain its 'competitiveness'.

Mr King said: 'Our customers are facing huge pressures on their defence
budgets and affordability has become an increasing priority.

'Our 
business needs to rise to this challenge to maintain its competitiveness
and ensure its long-term future.'

But union chief Brendan Barber branded the decision 'yet another devastating body blow to our manufacturing base'.

Phil McCarthy of the GMB union added that it
was a ‘disgrace’ that staff had found out about the cuts through media 
leaks over the weekend rather than from the company.

BAE was known to be planning to axe 
jobs in the UK as cuts to defence budgets hit sales of the Eurofighter 
Typhoon combat jet, which is currently in action over Libya with the 
Royal Air Force.

Shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper told BBC Breakfast that the job losses were 'devastating'.

She said: 'This is high-skilled jobs in Yorkshire and Lancashire. I think people will be very worried about this news.

'I
think what this really shows is the irresponsibility of having the 
scale of public sector cuts that we have been seeing at a time when the 
private sector is just not growing.

BAE has cut jobs across the UK but the greatest losses have been felt at three plants:

Brough plant (899 jobs lost) - Home of the Hawk Jet Trainer (pictured). There are 900 of these low-cost combat aircraft in use. It is the most sucessful training aircraft in the world and is used by the RAF and airforces in India, South Africa, Canada, the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.

 - 'And so you haven't got a whole series of private sector jobs, high-skilled jobs across the North for people to go into if they lose their jobs at BAE.

'So I think the Government does really need to respond to this and say what they are going to do about it.'

Ian Waddell of the Unite union said: 
‘These job losses will be a hammer blow to the UK defence industry, 
which is already reeling with the consequences  of the Government’s 'buy
off the shelf' policy.’

He called on the Government to offer 
immediate support to BAE Systems to keep its order book strong and avert
heavy job losses.

Labour defence spokesman Jim Murphy said the news was
‘a real knock for UK manufacturing’.

He added: ‘At a time when it is so hard to find a new job, this is a dreadful moment to lose the one you have.

‘The defence industry is vital to the UK, supporting both our forces on the front line and the wider UK economy.’

BAE has a 33 per cent stake in the 
Eurofighter joint venture company – alongside EADS and Finmeccanica – and has received orders for 550 planes from Britain, Germany, Italy 
and Spain, the four partner countries involved in the project.

The company announced a round of job cuts in January after issuing a £410million profits warning.

Despite efforts to maintain staff, BAE has not been able to make up for all the sharp defence budget cuts.

Last year it announced 1,400 job 
losses as a result of the cancellation of the Nimrod search and rescue 
aircraft contract and the scrapping of Harrier jump jets.

In July, BAE reported a 12 per cent 
drop in pre-tax profits to £691 million for the six months to the end of
June and it predicted that sales would fall again in the second half of
the year.

Grounded: BAE was known to be planning to axe jobs in the UK as cuts to defence budgets hit sales of the Eurofighter Typhoon combat jet

The savage cuts have not just affected
BAE’s British business. About half the company’s sales are in America, 
which has also been hit by defence spending cuts.

BAE executives fear there is no end in sight to the squeeze on Government defence spending.

And there is always a chance that some
huge orders such as the £6billion contract for two aircraft carriers, 
which are not due to be completed until the end of the decade, could 
still be cancelled.
