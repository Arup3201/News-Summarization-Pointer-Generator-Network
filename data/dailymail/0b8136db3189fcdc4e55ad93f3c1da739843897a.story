Forget cosmetic surgery and expensive moisturisers, a make-up artist believes she can make women look younger with flawless skin simply by using cosmetics.

Erika Toth, 40, from London, has worked on fashion shows, magazine shoots and with celebrities including actresses Kirsty Mather and Sheree Murphy.

She said she can make anyone look beautiful with the right make-up application.

Before and after: Make-up artist Erika Toth can give anyone a flawless look using cosmetics

Erika said: 'I try to show women ways to maximise their beauty so they never have to go through the pain of feeling inadequate

'I meet a lot of women with very low self 
esteem because they feel they aren't beautiful enough. I think that's 
what really pushed me into make-up and that lead me to create such an 
extreme version of beauty.

'I try to show women ways to maximise their 
beauty so they never have to go through the pain of feeling inadequate,' she told lovemycourse.com

Erika started out in the make-up industry at the age of 30 having originally trained to be an artist specialising with ceramics.

Transformation: She said the women she works with all feel more confident afterwards

She believes her background in art has helped further her career as cosmetic artist as it taught her how to be creative with a steady hand.

But Erika said anyone can learn the techniques using products available on the High Street - she uses brands such as M.A.C, YSL, Dior and Clinique.

To prove her point, she has joined lovemycourse.com as a beauty expert so people can sign up via the website to her make-up masterclasses.

She trains people seeking a career as a make-up artist as well as those just after some beauty advice, such as how to achieve a smokey eye look.

Erika submitted her before and after pictures to the website to prove the results she can achieve with her cosmetic brushes.

Nakia Garriques, digital executive at lovemycourse, said she was amazed by the transformations.

She said: 'I was really impressed with the make-overs. The after pictures looked nothing like the before pictures and I thought it would be hard for most people to figure out which woman is which.

'To test my theory, I sent the images to my 68 colleagues asking them to guess which before pictures matched the after pictures for the chance to win an afternoon of champagne tasting.

'I was surprised when almost everyone failed to match all images to the correct women and I must admit that if it wasn't for seeing the before and after pictures together, I myself would have guessed incorrectly. Needless to say, nobody won the afternoon of champagne tasting!'

Impressive: Erika has honed her talent on fashion shows and magazine shoots

Easy to replicate: Erika uses make-up brands available on the High Street to achieve her looks

Malaz Madani, digital manager at lovemycourse added: 'There is a lot of hidden talent out there and lovemycourse gives people the opportunity to share their skills and talent with everyone else.

'This was the main reason we started the site, to offer a platform for talented individuals like Erika to shine. We are exceptionally proud of Erika and we know she will continue to do well.'
