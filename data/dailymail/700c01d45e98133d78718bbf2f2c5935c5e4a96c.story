A 19-year-old Dutch model who appeared in court after stealing three chocolate bars from a shore in New York has avoided  a criminal record by doing one day’s community service at a soup kitchen in the city.

Roosmarijn de Kok was stopped as she left Whole Foods in Tribeca, Manhattan, on July 18 with three chocolates and bottle of fish oil in her bag which she hadn't paid for.

De Kok, who has appeared in Vogue Thailand and modeled for Urban Outfitters, was arrested by a store detective as she attempted to leave the store.

She was charged with misdemeanor petty larceny and criminal possession of stolen property in the fifth degree.

The Dutch model was also told off by a judge at Manhattan Criminal Court for folding her arms during her August hearing, to which she wore Saint Laurent.

De Kok spent October 24 feeding the homeless at the Lower East Side Girls Club, reports The New York Post.

Her friend, the actress Rosario Dawson, is a board member of the charity and joined her.

De Kok didn’t have to make an admission of guilt as part of the deal. If she stays out of trouble for six months, the charges against her will be dismissed.

Her lawyer, Sal Strazzullo, said de Kok forgot she had the chocolates in her bag after buying fat-free yogurt and protein bars from the health food shop.

'While she was about to leave the store … she remembered what she had in her bag. When she turned around, the store detectives were like: "We got you"' he said.

'She decided she wanted to put this behind her.'
