The Royal Air Force has spent £14,000 of taxpayers' cash on a golf simulator - despite losing 10,000 staff in just four years as part of Ministry of Defence cuts.

The indoor device, which enables members of the RAF's golf team to train in the winter, has been installed at RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire.

But with the salary of a new airman said to be just under £14,500 during basic training, the decision has already sparked anger.

The Sunday Times reports that the simulator cost a total of £23,000 with £13,960 coming from a grant funded by the taxpayer.

It is for the use of both the men's and ladies' golf teams at the RAF - but all armed forces personnel can use it for a £20 annual subscription.

The newspaper quotes Flight Sergeant Jai Henderson as telling RAF News: 'It is an excellent coaching tool which will be utilised by the RAF golf team throughout the winter season to develop their players.'

But the purchase of the simulator, which is of a standard used by golf professionals, has already attracted criticism.

The Sunday Times reports that the RAF has lost more than 9,500 personnel since 2010 amid deep cuts by the MoD. 

The newspaper quotes Andy Silverster from the campaign group the Taxpayers' Alliance, as saying the machine 'simply isn't the priority' when it comes to defence spending.

But an MoD spokesman told The Sunday Times: 'The golf facility at RAF Cranwell is open to all HM forces serving personnel and, in addition to generating interest and participation in golf, provides an excellent recreational outlet to the balance and wellbeing of our personnel.'
