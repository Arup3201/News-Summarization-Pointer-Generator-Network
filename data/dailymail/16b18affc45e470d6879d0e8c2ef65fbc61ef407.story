As a carefree and impressionable teenager, Rudite Zalkalns was too naïve to spot the warning signs.

After meeting Arnis Zalkalns by chance at a nightclub in Latvia, she was seduced by his chiselled looks and soon fell madly in love with him.

Despite her mother’s concerns over his temper she agreed to marry him at the tender age of 19. Within three years, she was dead.

Arnis Zalkalns (left) married Rudite when she was just 19. Three years later he murdered her.

Her husband tricked her into going to a deserted forest with her, claiming they were on their way to pick up a new motorbike he had bought her.

Once alone he bludgeoned her over the head with a scaffold pole before stabbing her through the chest. He then pushed her body into a grave he had already dug, covering her with soil and leaves.

Arnis then toasted her murder by drinking a bottle of vodka as he stood over her shallow grave. 

Her mother Viktorija Zalkalns, 70, told the Mail that the seven-year sentence he served for the murder was disgracefully short.

And she came close to tears when she learnt that he is the prime suspect in the Alice Gross case.

Speaking from her modest apartment on the outskirts of Riga, she said: ‘I always feared he might kill again.

‘Once you have tasted blood the taste stays and you never stop. He killed our lovely daughter and destroyed our family.

‘I’m still angry at the length of his sentence. This was a callous and heartless murder with no remorse. My daughter was trained in karate but she couldn’t fight him off.

‘He prepared my daughter’s grave in advance and planted the weapons next to it. Then he tricked her into going with him to a forest.’

Arnis Zalkalns shot his wife in the stomach with a low-calibre gun after a row in 1996. She survived, but Arnis refused to pay for a surgeon to remove the bullet which had lodged next to her spine

Zalkalns, now 41, was raised in Riga and worked on building sites and dockyards from the age of 16.

By the time he was an adult he had developed a penchant for chasing young, impressionable women.

After meeting Rudite, a seamstress, he showered her with compliments and promises of a long and happy future together.

When she fell pregnant the couple quickly decided to marry. At their low-key ceremony in Riga, in late 1994, she wore a maternity dress to disguise the fact she was seven months pregnant.

In an unusual move, he decided that they should both use her maiden name of Zalkalns, rather than his surname Daksa as is traditional.

‘I didn’t like him from the beginning,’ Rudite’s mother said. ‘He was a control freak and had a fierce temper. But it was my daughter’s first boyfriend and she was so very much in love so what could I do?’

Viktorija Zalkalns, a former school caretaker, claims her son-in-law had affairs with other women in full view of Rudite.

And after the birth of their daughter Elvira in February 1995 the relationship deteriorated further.

Entries in Rudite’s diary show how depressed and fearful she had become of her husband.

A year later he shot her in the stomach with a low-calibre gun after a row. She survived, but Arnis refused to pay for a surgeon to remove the bullet which had lodged next to her spine. Instead, the doctors simply stitched up the wound with the bullet still inside her.

At first Rudite claimed that she had been shot by a member of a biker gang in a case of mistaken identity.

And even when she told her mother the truth, she was too scared to report her husband to the police.

A year later, in March 1997, he murdered her. She was just 22.

Arnis Zalkalns is the prime suspect in the hunt for missing Alice Gross, 14, who was last seen on August 28

In an attempt to cover up the crime he told friends and the police that his wife was missing.

But he soon became the prime suspect after detectives found his wife’s diary in which she described her despair.

In July that year Arnis confessed to her murder and showed police where he had buried her.

He pleaded guilty in court the following year and was initially sentenced to 12 years, which was reduced to eight after an appeal. He served only seven.

At court he claimed he murdered his wife because she had become a lesbian and was visiting gay nightclubs. He even claimed he saw her molest their young daughter.

But Viktorija Zalkalns insists such claims are nonsense and were put forward by Arnis to reduce his sentence. Instead, she claims her daughter was killed because Rudite had discovered her husband had links to drug deals carried out by the Latvian mafia.

After her daughter’s death, Viktorija brought up her granddaughter Elvira herself. At one stage, she had to go to court to fight for custody of the child after Arnis instructed lawyers from his prison cell to tell a judge that she was an unfit carer.

Rudite’s father Valdis struggled to cope with his daughter’s murder. The railway worker turned to drink and had to be admitted to a psychiatric hospital. He died in 2003 at the age of 75. 

Meanwhile Elvia began to ask where her mother and father were after hearing whispers in the school playground from the age of seven.

When Zalkalns was released from prison in 2005 he moved to Liepaja in the west of Latvia where he reportedly married a gipsy woman with whom he had a baby boy.

According to Viktorija, Elvira found out about her father’s new wife and sent her a message warning her that she was married to a killer.

Within two years Arnis fled to London where he made new friends who were also oblivious to his past.
