A father-of-two has blasted bosses who sacked him after he took part in the ice bucket challenge to raise money for charity.

Matthew Hearn, 30, from Fleetwood, Lancashire, was stunned when he was dismissed by bosses for taking part in the charity challenge - particularly as he claims he was given the go-ahead by his regional manager.

The father-of-two hoped his employers at Freeport Fleetwood shopping centre would see the funny side of his prank but he was sacked, as bosses say he took part in the challenge during working hours.

But Mr Hearn claims that filming of the challenge took place after his shift finished at 3pm.

A fellow work colleague was so outraged by Mr Hearn's treatment that he quit in disgust.

Mr Hearn, the sole breadwinner for a family of four, including his newborn baby Macey and three-year-old daughter Emily, said: 'I'm fuming, as you can imagine.

'I'm out of work and I've got two kids I have to provide for

'I'm gutted by it because I feel I was doing a great job there.'

Mr Hearn's partner Stacey Carley, 28, said: 'We're both shocked. I don't have a job at the moment because I stay at home with the children so this is really going to set us back now.'

Immediately following the sacking Ms Carley posted on her Facebook page: 'Being sacked from a full time job for doing the ALS ice bucket challenge outside of work hours, in your own time, but because it was "on site"  - in other words behind shops, out of public view - that's grounds for dismissal? Even though permission at the time was given by the area manager?

'Jobs are hard enough to come by sometimes these days.

'Freeport should be seen to encourage and support charities not the opposite!'

Mr Hearn had held the position of cleaning manager at the complex since June - a service sub-contracted by the centre to Care Facility Management.

He decided to do the challenge with two colleagues last Saturday.

But on Tuesday he was told of disciplinary proceedings against him, before his termination was made official on Wednesday by Care Facility Management.

Mr Hearn added: 'One of the most disgusting things about it was I thought a bit of charity would be encouraged.'

One of his colleagues who was involved in the stunt, Thomas Turner, resigned in protest at Mr Hearn's sacking.

Mr Turner, 21, himself a father-of-one, was working as a cleaner when the challenge took place.

Mr Turner, from South Shore, Blackpool, said: 'Everybody else has been doing it and its for a good cause.

'Sacking somebody for doing something for charity is ridiculous.'

Mr Hearn's bosses admitted the ice bucket challenge had led to the sacking.

Jim MacKinnon, Care Facility Management's director, said: 'This incident involving the ice bucket challenge within his working hours at the centre was a contributing factor. 

'It was one of the reasons he did not meet our requirements for the role.'

Freeport Fleetwood centre manager, John Magee said: 'We are fully supportive of members of staff who wish to get involved in charitable activity on our site.

'Just last week another member of staff asked permission to perform her ice bucket challenge within the centre outside of working hours, which was fine.'
