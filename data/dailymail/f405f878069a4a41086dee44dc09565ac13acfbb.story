A man has gone from struggling to fasten his seatbelt on a plane to looking forward to taking his first flying lessons after losing more than 11st.

Thirty-one-year-old Brendan O’Donnell has dreamed of fulfilling his ambition to learn to fly for years but was always too heavy for light aircraft. Now he’s slimmed from 25st 9lb to 14st 6lb and been named Slimming World Man of the Year 2014 – and to celebrate he’s planning to take to the air.

Brendan, who works for insurance firm Aviva, was nicknamed ‘Big Bee’ as a child and has struggled with his weight since school.

He would hide behind jokes about his size and, despite attempting to slim down in the past, it wasn’t until his 30th birthday that he decided to make a serious change.

He says: ‘I turned 30 at the beginning of 2013. You get to that age and I suppose you start to grow up a bit. I’d been lucky and didn’t have any health problems, but I began to wonder how long I could continue with the lifestyle I was leading and remain reasonably healthy.

‘We organised a number of birthday celebrations throughout the year and looking back I realise my weight impacted on a lot of them. A holiday to Spain last summer was almost ruined because I spent the whole time feeling too hot to enjoy myself, and on the plane home I only just managed to fasten the seatbelt. It dug into me for the whole flight and I decided enough was enough.

Brendan used to eat an unhealthy diet of convenience food, snacking on crisps and chocolate

Back home Brendan and his wife Sarah, who live in Fridaythorpe in East Yorkshire, joined a nearby Slimming World group in Driffield in August 2013. Brendan says: ‘Anyone who says they weren’t nervous when they first joined Slimming World, especially a bloke, probably isn’t telling the truth.

‘I was terrified because I thought everyone was going to turn and look at me, but I needn’t have worried as everyone was so friendly and welcoming – and there was even another man there which pleased me no end! I quickly realised I’d come to the right place and I’ve made so many friends there now, it’s like having your own cheerleading squad every week.’

Brendan's incredible achievement has resulted in him being crowned Slimming World's Man of the Year

Brendan and Sarah swapped their diet of ready meals, convenience foods and weekly takeaways for cooking meals from scratch including their favourite dish of barbecue pulled pork. He says: ‘I’ve followed meal replacement diets before and lost several stone but they taught me nothing about changing the way I eat and my relationship with food, so when I stopped, the weight went back on as quickly as I’d lost it.

‘I love that I can fill my plate and feel satisfied – the only problem now is that Sarah and I argue over who gets to do the cooking because we both enjoy it so much!’

Previously doing minimal activity, Brendan has discovered a love of running during his weight loss

As well as overhauling his eating habits, Brendan’s discovered a love of running. He says: ‘I’ve never been sporty and at school I’d do anything I could to avoid PE. But after I’d lost a bit of weight I decided I wanted to increase my activity levels and my consultant, Shirley, told me about the couch to 5km challenge, which promised to get you running for 30 minutes within weeks.

‘I decided to give it a try and within eight weeks I ran 30 minutes without stopping – in fact, I was so pleased I ended up running for 45 minutes because I didn’t want to stop! Since then I’ve taken part in 10k races and I’d like to attempt further in the future.

Breakfast: Croissants, large latte

Lunch: Pre-packed sandwiches, large bag of crisps and a bag of sweets

Dinner: Frozen pizza with a large portion of chips

Snacks: Sharing bags of crisps or chocolate bars

Since joining Slimming World Brendan’s lost 11st 3lb and dropped from a size 6XL and a 48in waist to wearing M-L clothes and a 34in waist while his wife Sarah has lost nearly 4st.

Brendan, who would like to lose another stone to reach his personal target weight, says: “It’s been incredible and doing it together with Sarah has been really important because whenever one of us has had a bad day the other one is there to pick them up and keep us both on track. I feel fantastic and being named as Slimming World Man of the Year 2014 is incredible.’

This summer when Brendan heads off on holiday he’s not worrying about the heat or aeroplane seats and he has big plans for the rest of the year too. 

He says: ‘We’re returning to a music festival we went to last year and planning to recreate some of the photos to see the difference in us. I’m also hoping to try scuba diving now I can fit in a wetsuit, and I’m going to learn to fly which is something I’d always wanted to do but I was previously too heavy for light aircraft.

‘People always say that losing weight has given them a second chance at life but I’ve never been this slim before so I feel like this is my first chance and I’m determined to make the most of it. I’m never going back to the old Brendan, this is me forever now.’
