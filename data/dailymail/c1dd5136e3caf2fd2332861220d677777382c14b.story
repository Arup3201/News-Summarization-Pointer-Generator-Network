Melonie Joyce Martin, 44,  faces prison time after allegedly biting another basketball coach in the eye and nose

A female high school basketball from Georgia faces prison time after allegedly biting another coach in the eye and nose.

Melonie Joyce Martin, 44, who heads up the South Cobb Eagles girls team, reportedly got into a profanity-laced argument with Tyrone Harris of Campbell High School on January 9.

According to her arrest warrant, an assistant principal and two other coaches watched on as she threw a chair at Harris and threatened to burst his 'grill' while they came head-to-head.

'I’m about to beat your [expletive] and stomp you, and I’ll beat your [expletive] and knock your teeth out of your face,' Martin allegedly said.

Authorities say the confrontation happened inside a school office after the South Cobb girls team lost to Campbell High School. 

Police issued an arrest warrant for Martin on January 13 and charged her with simple battery, a felony, misdemeanor and terroristic threats.

She was released from jail after around seven hours on a $7,500 bail.

It is unknown if she will be back on the court sidelines for an upcoming game next Tuesday.

S. Carlton Rouse, Martin's attorney, tells WSB-TV that she denies touching Harris and never threatened his safety.

He added that Martin intends to vigorously fight the charges.

'[She] will continue to do what is in her power to protect her clean reputation for excellence in the classroom and in athletic programs within the school.'

Along with coaching basketball, Martin is a language arts teacher, according to her school’s website.

Scene of the crime: Martin heads up the South Cobb Eagles girls team - it's unknown if she has been suspended from her coaching role
