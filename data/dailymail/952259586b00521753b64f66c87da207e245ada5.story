L'Wren Scott's grieving sister has criticised Mick Jagger for having the designer buried in Los Angeles and turning the funeral into a 'media circus'.

Jan Shane said that no members of the family - apart from brother Randall - made the trip from their home in Utah to the private wake held at Hollywood Forever Cemetery.

Mrs Shane said she felt her sister deserved to be buried in Utah, where she was born and brought up, and that her family and friends from her home town of Ogden, in the state, were devastated at being kept out of the ceremony.

'Hijacked': L'Wren Scott's sister Jan Shane is speaking out against Mick Jagger, who she says has hijacked the late designer's final rites from her family in Utah

'She has been away from home for so long, this is her place, not in some strange cemetery in Los Angeles. It has no connection,' said Shane (pictured left with her husband Rob at their Utah home)

She said it was made especially hard that L'Wren was 
cremated, meaning none of her family will ever get to say a proper goodbye.

Mormons - Scott was brought up in the faith - generally have an opportunity to see the deceased in an open casket before the funeral, and although cremation is not forbidden, burial is more usual.

The funeral was not held under the Mormon rite, blessings and prayers were led by the Rev Ed Bacon from the All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena.

It is, however, the fact that the designer's last resting place is a Los Angeles cemetery that has upset Mrs Shane, a mother of eight, the most.

'It's become a media circus, it's so
 not how Luann would have wanted it,' she said.

'All you read is how devastated he 
is, well, he's not the only one. I don't get to see her, neither do her 
family and the friends that she grew up with. We want to say goodbye, 
but he's taken over.

'I hate to believe that it's become a showbiz, fake funeral': The Jagger family including Georgia May and Liz leave a reception for L'Wren Scott, following her funeral in Hollywood,California.  The reception was held at Sunset Towers hotel. Jan Shane called the funeral

'She has been away from home 
for so long, this is her place, not in some strange cemetery in Los 
Angeles. It has no connection, but it's Mick and his kids that are 
making all the decisions.

'He hijacked this funeral. Yes, he was with her for 13 years, but family is family, that's what it boils down to.

'She's
 going to be alone there at this cemetery. I wish it had been handled 
differently.Â  I hate to believe that it's become a showbiz, fake funeral
 - she deserves more. She's a human being, she made a life that was 
hers, not his. She deserves to be remembered for herself.

'She'll
 be buried and passed away as Mick's girlfriend, not Luann Bambrough or 
L'Wren Scott. It's so far blown out of proportion, she's a human being, 
she deserves more.'

Mrs Shane, 53, previously spoke before the funeral to disclose that she had been barred by her brother, Randall, from attending.

The pair had fallen out over their mother's funeral arrangements in 2008.

However Mrs Shane said it was not just her who had wanted to attend the ceremony for her sister, who was 49 when she died.

'I know there's a lot in the family 
who couldn't travel,' she said.

'We've got a huge family in Utah, it's made it hard 
for them to pay their respects.
 I've talked to cousins, they can't believe what Mick's done.

'There's 
more wondering why she's not being brought her home. We'd all like to 
see her next to mom and dad, that's what we believe.

'What
 hurts the most is that I know how we were raised, the love we were 
shown when growing up, and this isn't the way it's meant to happen.'

Mrs Shane said she felt that the funeral had failed to be a dignified event.

'It's
 really sad. She's not a thing that should be just paraded around,' she said.

'She's
 a human being. It shouldn't be a paparazzi circus. Mick has taken over,
 I can't compete with them, how can you? You can't compete with a 
showbiz machine like the Jaggers.'

The funeral was in fact attended by 70 people, including Jagger, his children and some of his grandchildren, and friends of the couple.

They included Nicole Kidman, who had been a friend of Scott, and also frequently wore her designs on the red carpet, her husband Keith Urban, Eurythmics guitarist Dave Stewart, who played music, and fellow designer Ira M. Hammons-Glass and creative director Adam Glassman.

However there 
was no sign of Jagger's bandmates Keith Richards, Charlie Watts or Ron 
Wood.

Family and friends 
also attended the reception at the Sunset Tower Hotel, about a nine 
minute drive from the funeral home, following the service.

Nicole Kidman was among the mourners at L'Wren Scott's funeral in Los Angeles. She was accompanied by her husband, Kieth Urban. Kidman and the designer had been friends for many years, and she often wore Scott's designs.

Jade Jagger was present at the funeral for her father Mick's partner L'Wren Scott. The designer, 42, is heavily pregnant, and also due to become a grandmother. Her daughter Assisi is also pregnant but was not seen at the funeral.

Last resting place: L'Wren Scott's funeral and cremation was at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery. Her family largely did not attend, although her brother had arranged the ceremony with Mick Jagger, her partner.

The funeral is not the end of difficulties between Scott's family and her partner in the wake of her suicide earlier this month.

The designer's will, published yesterday, disclosed that all her estate will be left to Jagger. The two had been partners for 13 years but had no children.

But Mrs Shane said she will fight on behalf of her relatives to keep some personal items
 away from the Jagger family.

Speaking just before the will's contents became public, she said: 'I would assume she had a will, I'm not really sure.

'But I know 
after mum passed away, L'Wren took pictures away from the family home. 
They were my childhood, I want them back, I hate to think they're gone 
forever, it's our memories of growing up. The Jagger family doesn't need
 them, they're our memories from our childhood.

'She
 had things of mum's that have no use for anyone else, but there's some 
nieces and nephews that would want them. I would like it kept in the 
family, they don't need to be destroyed or given away.'

Mrs Shane made her own act of remembrance at home at the same time as her sister's funeral in Los Angeles.

'I planted her favorite flowers in my
 yard on Monday and that was from me to her,' she said, crying.

'They were her favorites - 
blue pansies that she loved. I planted them in the front yard in 
remembrance of her, so I had something.

'I can't argue with her being 
cremated as that was her wishes, it just want it makes it even more 
difficult to say goodbye. It's another twist, another thorn in the side.'

The pictures were taken at L'Wren's parents 50th wedding anniversary. After their parents died, Jan says L'Wren took memorabilia that she fears may now end up with strangers

'I know there's a lot in the family who couldn't travel,' said Shane. 'We've got a huge family in Utah, it's made it hard for them to pay their respects. I've not heard that anyone is going, and I've talked to cousins, they can't believe what Mick's done'
