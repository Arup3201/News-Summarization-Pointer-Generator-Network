Former Sons of Guns star Will Hayden has now been indicted in two separate child rape cases

An East Baton Rouge Parish grand jury has indicted former reality TV star Will Hayden on three counts of rape involving two victims.

The Advocate reports the 49-year-old Hayden, who once starred in the 'Sons of Guns' TV show based out of his Baton Rouge gun shop, was charged Wednesday with two counts of aggravated rape and one count of forcible rape.

Hayden is accused of raping a young girl multiple times between March 2013 and August According to the indictment.

The assaults allegedly began a few days after the girl's 11th birthday.

He's also accused of raping a woman in the early 1990s and was charged with forcible rape in that incident.

Hayden's attorney, Frank Holthaus, could not confirm the indictment, saying he had yet to see it.

Hayden was arrested August 27. After the arrest, The Discovery Channel canceled the show, citing 'the serious and horrific nature of the charges' against the star.

He was arrested on aggravated rape charges involving a child and had already faced child molestation and aggravated crime against nature charges stemming from an arrest August 9.

Hayden began having sex with the child, then 11 years old, in 2013, according to allegations in an affidavit filed by sheriff's deputies. The latest rape, the report said, happened in July.

A guardian of the victim contacted deputies Aug. 16. The victim confided to the guardian after Hayden's Aug. 9 arrest, according to the report.

Deputies said they met with the child and guardian and took a statement.

According to the affidavit, the child told deputies Hayden took her virginity when she was 11 years old and that sex acts happened almost daily thereafter.

The report says Hayden coerced the victim into silence with threats of physical abuse.

'Don't tell them nothing because I'm all you've got,' the affidavit says the 49-year-old Hayden told the victim.

'Sons of Guns' began airing in 2011 and followed Hayden's family-owned custom firearms business. Episodes often showed Hayden and his adult daughter, Stephanie, helping customers find weapons, including rifles. Other scenes showed the process of making the guns, images from firing ranges, and ammunition tips.
