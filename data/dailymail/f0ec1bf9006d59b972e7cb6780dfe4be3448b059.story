Paul Lambert has said new deals for Fabian Delph and Ron Vlaar are next on the agenda for Aston Villa and insisted the club must maintain their momentum.

Fresh from signing a contract extension to June 2018, the Villa manager wants to tie down two top performers whose terms expire next summer.

Lambert also revealed Christian Benteke had suffered no ill effects from a week’s training with the first team following his return from Achilles injury.

Talks with Delph and Vlaar should step up soon. ‘That’s the next on the agenda,’ he said. ‘To speak to those lads and see what we can do and get things going. If we can get those lads tied up that’s what we’ll try to do.’

Benteke ruptured his Achilles five months ago but has begun ball work in training and increasingly been tested with challenges from teammates.

Lambert described his return as ‘massive’, adding: ‘He’s trained all week, no adverse reactions. But he’s got tow work like everyone else to get back in the side.

‘He trained this morning with a wee bit of contact, more than on other days. You’ve got to watch him and make sure there are no ill affects. He still a wee bit off it. This week’s been good for him.’

On his own contract, Lambert added: ‘The chairman came to me about a month ago and asked what I was thinking. He had his views and I had mine.

‘I love being here. It’s a fantastic club. I have a great working relationship with the chairman. He asked my feelings and I was delighted. Let’s try and kick on from where we have started.’
