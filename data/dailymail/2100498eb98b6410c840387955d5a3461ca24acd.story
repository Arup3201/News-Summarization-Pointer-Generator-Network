Police revealed CCTV had been 'crucial' in the hunt for missing schoolgirl Alice Gross 

CCTV has played a 'crucial' role in the hunt for missing schoolgirl Alice Gross who disappeared more than four weeks ago. 

Scotland Yard said it had scoured footage from hundreds of cameras in a bid to trace the 14-year-old who was last seen crossing a towpath at Grand Union Canal in west London on August 28. 

Officers are reviewing film from around 300 cameras over a six-mile square area as the search for Alice enters its fifth week. 

But while CCTV has aided investigations, police said they were also relying on the public to turf up new information. 

Detective Superintendent Carla Mehta said: 'CCTV is clearly crucial in our investigation, but we still need the public's help and I want to hear from anyone who saw Alice during the afternoon of the Thursday she was last seen.

'Our searches are continuing in the local area today, and there are extra officers involved. I'd like to thank the community who have been so supportive and patient.

'In over 30 years of policing I have never seen such a strong community reaction. This is a community that is totally behind the search to find Alice and bring her home.'

She added the case's prime suspect, Latvian murderer Arnis Zalkalns, who was seen cycling on the same towpath 15 minutes after Alice, was just 'one line of inquiry' in the investigation. 

Zalkalns, who killed his wife in 1997 before entering the UK where he was arrested for assaulting a teenager the same age as Alice in 2007, went missing at the beginning of September.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said so far the search had involved underwater and confined space experts 

Detective Superintendent Carla Mentha said police were still appealing to members of the public for any information about the girl 

Yesterday officers revealed a staged reconstruction of the last known movements of the schoolgirl had incited more than 150 phone calls from viewers. 

The video, which showed a girl of Alice's age and appearance walking across the canal towpath swinging her arms distinctly, was shown on television on Thursday. 

Investigators however drew a blank yesterday afternoon after finding nothing at Elthorne Park in Hanwell, Ealing, which had been declared an area of interest.

Forensic teams combed the leafy park in the morning and even erected a tent in one field after being notified of 'disturbed ground'. 

Officers are still searching the Grand Union Canal, where a six-inch knife was discovered last week. 

Metropolitan Police however said they had no reason to believe Alice had come to any harm. 

Her family released an emotional appeal this week, sharing photographs and video footage of the teenager singing. 

Her parents Jose Gross and Rosalind Hodgkiss said in a statement: 'Alice has been missing for four weeks now.

'We are desperately concerned about her welfare and worry constantly about what may have happened to her.

'We are appealing to Alice. If you are out there, to come home where you belong. We love you and we miss you. 

'We want to see your smile again, we want to hear you sing again, to see you cuddle Peggy, or sit at the piano. We want to be a family again.' 

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said today: 'This continues to be a massive investigation.

'A range of officers and staff from across the Met are taking part in the ever-expanding search for Alice.

'To date the search has involved the Met's underwater and confined space search team, marine support unit, search dogs, air support unit, Territorial Support Group, local borough officers, volunteer police cadets, visual images identification and detections officers, plus licensed search officers.'
