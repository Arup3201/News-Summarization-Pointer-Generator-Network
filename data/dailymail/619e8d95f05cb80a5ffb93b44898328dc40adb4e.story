Bunk beds line the walls in a large room where light streams through barred windows and a group of men gaze at a TV mounted to the wall.

There are reading rooms down the corridor where some men study at desks. And the garden is complete with a greenhouse, where shrubs and plants are planted in the baking Jordanian heat.

This is now the home of radical Isliamist Abu Qatada- the reviled hate preacher who used human rights appeals to prolong his stay in Britain.

Inside: Abu Qatada occupies a communal cell like this one, where there is a TV mounted on the wall and inmates can choose to wear their own clothes

Facilities: Muwaqqar Prison has a library where students can read and study. The Jordanian jail holds 718 inmates in total

Ominous: For all its perks, the prison looks daunting with barbed-wire fences and watch towers

The 53-year-old is being held in Muwaqqar Jail outside Amman, where he shares a cell with 15 other inmates.

Many of the prisoners have been sentenced or charged with offences against state security.

Muwaqqar is known as one of Jordan's best-kept prisons.

Colour-coded textbooks and maps are lined up in the prison's libraries and there is a computer room for the inmates.

The inmates are allowed to wear their own clothes, and only have to wear a brown prison uniform to leave their cell.

They are referred to as 'guests,' according to the Sun, where 
they can be visited by friends or relatives for half an hour, three 
times a week.

Charged: Qatada is being held on terrorist charges. He was deported from Belmarsh prison in London on Sunday after eight years of stalling

Conditions: Prison inmates can use volleyball or football courts (pictured right) for exercise at the prison. Officers guard the prison's entrance (left)

Activities: Abu Qatada will tend to plants and vegetables in the greenhouse with other prison 'guests'

Green-fingered: Inmates plant shrubs and flowers in the baking Jordanian desert as part of their dauily ritual at Muwaqqar

Football and voleyball pitches are used during recreation time by the prison's 'guests'.

The
prison has 240 solitary confinement cells, but Qatada has been placed 
in a communal cell, where he will bunk with other inmates.

He was transferred there on Sunday from Belmarsh prison in South East London.

According to the Telegraph, Qatada's family have already been to visit him, speaking with him through a glass barrier.

Once Qatada left the UK and landed at 
Jordan’s Marka military airport, the authorities moved swiftly.

He was 
driven in a green SUV, escorted by a 12-car convoy, to the sealed-off 
state security court in Amman.

Military prosecutors charged him with 
conspiracy to carry out terrorist acts, remanded him in custody for 15 
days and then took him to Muwaqqar prison.

Well-kept: Muwaqqar is known for having high standards

Textbook: Rows of colour-coded mathematics books are available to prisoners who want to further their education

He was first arrested over 
his alleged terror connections in 2001. He was rearrested in 2005, when 
attempts to deport him began.

He lodged appeal after appeal, claiming 
his human rights would be infringed if he was sent home – finally 
winning his case in the European Court of Human Rights last year.

But Home Secretary Theresa May continued to pursue his 
removal, signing a landmark treaty with Jordan promising that no 
evidence obtained by torture would be used against him.

Part of the treaty ensures Qatada's proper treatment in prison.
