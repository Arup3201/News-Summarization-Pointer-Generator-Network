Jimmy Savile's Highland cottage has been targeted by vandals, with black graffiti spray-painted across the outside. 

The remote white-washed property is thought to be where the disgraced TV presenter may have abused dozens of children over the decades.

'Jimmy the beast' was written on the wall of his holiday home outside the village of Glencoe and the door was badly damaged.

The incident was reported yesterday 7.30am by a passer-by.

A spokesman for the Northern Constabulary force said 'abusive slogans' were painted on the walls of the property.

Former Highland Councillor Drew McFarlane-Slack, who lives in neighbouring Ballachulish, told The Sun: 'I deplore any kind of actions like that.

'But when people have said things have happened in that house, it doesn't make it understandable, but people will take action when they are so angry. It would be better if the executors act quickly and get it sold and into the hands of somebody who can remove the stain that’s on it.'

Criminal: A spokesman for the Northern Constabulary force said they are investigating

Evidence: The remote cottage was raided last week by police

Anger: Witnesses saw three men in their 20s throwing stones at the house and spray-painting the walls

BBC Scotland reporter Andreas Wolff 
said he had been told that witnesses saw three men in their 20s throwing
stones at the house and spray-painting the walls.

He said a black car was seen in front of the house with the doors wide open.

Last week officers searched the cottage to look for 'any evidence of any others being involved in any offending with him.'

Frozen
in time, his hairbrush, documents, ashtray and even his food were
scattered around the empty home just as he left them.

Other rooms in the cottage, where he once entertained Prince Charles over dinner, contained bunk beds and a double bed all made up neatly with fresh bed linen.

Officers believe Savile's cottage, called Alt-na-reigh, could hold vital clues that could help the  investigation.

Search: Savile's former Highland home has been raided by police because it is believed he may have abused more than 20 there

Time capsule: All rooms in the cottage, including the living area containing Savile's chair and table, had been untouched since his death last year

Famously Savile had the Prince of Wales around for dinner in 1999 and hired three waitresses in aprons with HRH sewn into them.

The Northern Constabulary, which led the raid, said they were helping the Met with their probe, while Scotland Yard said they would not comment on the ongoing investigation.

Savile maintained it was his dream to 
live in the Highlands and he spent huge sums converting the home, adding
glass walls, mains water and sewage as well as modernising its decor 
throughout.

Untouched: The cottage remains as it was when Savile died, and includes matches, hairbrush, ashtray, pens and even a biscuit belonging to the DJ

Bedroom: The neat and tidy room has a made bed and a single small picture hung on the wall

Front door: The property's entrance is shown in the background with several strong locks and a latch with the kitchen sink and worktops in the foreground

Because the cottage remains untouched since his death, it is stacked full of photos, clothes and documents, which could lead to identifying more victims or help those who have already made allegations of abuse.

Savile bought the Glencoe property, which is a mile from the nearest house, in 1998 and used it as a hideaway up until his death.

He bought it after falling in love with the area on a cycling holiday in 1944.

Eerie: Savile's chair, a dented bin and some of his possessions strewn about the room

Sign: The property was about to be sold this year but was kept by the Savile trust who wanted to make it into a retreat for the disabled

He became a regular in Glencoe village, with residents saying he was an 'attention seeker' who would wander around in a Highland kilt waving at passing tourists.

One man from the area described how he had asked for the DJ's autograph and instead got a bizarre message from him that read 'lost girls' should visit him.

The cottage was to be sold this year for £300,000 but this was halted by his charitable trust, who wanted to convert it into a respite centre for the disabled.

Reputation: Savile was known to show off when in Glencoe, especially to tourists, pictured here serving tea to American honeymoon couple Brian and Rebekah Morovitz at a Highland restaurant

But this is now in doubt after it announced it is to close down.

Trustees had hoped the property - one of only two in the Glencoe gorge - could be used by mountaineering groups.

But the Mountaineering Council of Scotland said it had had no further contact since before the scandal broke.

The official biographer for Jimmy Savile says she is 'utterly devastated' by his betrayal.

Alison Bellamy first met Savile in the late 1990s through his charity work while she was a reporter for a local newspaper in his hometown of Leeds, West Yorkshire. She went on to write his authorised biography, ‘How’s About That, Then’.

But since the shocking revelations in recent weeks, Alison has revealed that she still cannot believe that Savile has gone from 'childhood hero to monster', adding: 'To find out he was not what I thought he was is utterly devastating.'

Describing the first time she went to his house, Alison wrote in Savile’s autobiography that she questioned whether she would be safe with him 'despite the rumours'.

She said: 'As a news reporter in his home city... I had heard the sly comments and whisperings about his fondness for young girls.'

When she confronted him about the rumours, he 'laughed them off', reacting 'as expected with a well-rehearsed speech: "It goes with the territory".'

'He was dismissive, as if what I was saying was ridiculous,' she said.

'He went on to tell me an anecdote about how he had been to give music lessons in a Leeds junior school and, some time later, two little girls aged about 11, knocked on the door of his flat and he let them in, gave them a cup of tea and sent them home. 'He said: "It was the stupidest thing I ever did as one of their dads came round threatening to kill me".'

And Alison has her own memories of encounters which now seem chilling.

'I wonder, when he used to sit quietly at the back of St Anne’s Catholic Cathedral, what he thought about. Did he pray?'

She added that at first she could not believe the rumours, saying: 'The predatory, child-abusing Savile the world has heard so much about for the last few weeks, was not the man we thought we knew so well.

'But after hearing stories from women first hand, I now have to accept the terrible truth.'

It has also been revealed the owner of a conference centre in Leeds has spent £50,000 pounds ridding the venue of Savile’s name after it was changed from Savile’s Hall to New Dock Hall.
