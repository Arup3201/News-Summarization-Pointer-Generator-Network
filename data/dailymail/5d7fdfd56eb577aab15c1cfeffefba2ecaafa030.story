Philippe Coutinho has revealed his desire to force his way into the Brazil squad on a regular basis.

The 22-year-old was overlooked for the World Cup by former national boss Luiz Felipe Scolari, but has since been called-up by Scolari's successor Dunga in both of his squads.

The Liverpool star has appeared in three of Brazil's four matches under Dunga and impressed as a second half substitute in their 4-0 victory against Japan on Tuesday.

Coutinho played the assist for talisman Neymar to score his second of the night, and admits he is still yet to establish himself as a regular international.

'I was able to cover a lot of ground [against Japan] and I think I took my opportunity rather well,' he said.

'Everything has to be for the team. Brazil have a lot of quality players and I have to work very hard to earn my place and remain in the squad the group.'
