Former Coronation Street star Ken Morley has boasted of 'groping and grabbing' women alongside his high-placed television friends in the 1980s, claiming 'everyone was at it'. 

The 71-year-old actor said touching women was 'part of the course' and that some of those arrested on suspicion of sexual offences by Operation Yewtree had been victims of a witch hunt.

Speaking before he entered the Celebrity Big Brother house, Morley added that while the Eighties were 'a promiscuous age', today he refrains from making sexual advances for fear of being accused of impropriety.

Asked whether any of those arrested had been victims of a witch hunt, Morley told the Sun's Katie Earlam: 'People like Jim Davidson were.' 

The comedian was arrested on suspicion of sexual offences but released without charge before going on to win the Channel Five reality show in which Morley is now taking part.

Of touching women, the Coronation Street actor continued: 'Everybody was at it. I was at it, we were all at it.

'Groping and grabbing was just part of the course. It was regarded as normal.' 

In the same interview, the father-of-one observed that authorities are 'touchy' about paedophiles and described Hitler as 'a funny guy.'

Morley starred in the BBC1 sitcom Allo! Allo! from 1988, before joining ITV's Coronation Street the following year.  

In the past he has spoken out against the Crown Prosecution Service in its pursuit of Operation Yewtree arrests following the trial of his former colleague Bill Roche, who was cleared of sexual offences.

'Considering the Michael Le Vell farce, they should be careful about the waste of taxpayers’ money,' he said after the unanimous verdict at Preston Crown Court in February last year.

Le Vell, another of his Coronation Street colleagues, was also cleared of sexual offences on children in September 2013.

Morley became known for his role as a womanising shop owner in the soap between 1989 and 1995. 

Since then he has taken on parts in pantomimes across the UK and appeared in a swathe of celebrity reality television programmes. 

In 2010 he shocked others taking part in a Coronation Street special of the Channel 4 cooking programme Come Dine With Me by groping female guests and making suggestive comments.

Dressed as an American preacher, the actor touched fellow actor Tupele Dorgu inappropriately. 

In the same episode, Morley cornered another Celebrity Big Brother veteran, Julie Goodyear, telling the actress: 'Sorry Julie, I must, I must... accept me', before trying to kiss her. 

A spokesman for the star was not available for  comment this morning. ITV and the BBC have yet to respond to MailOnline's requests.
