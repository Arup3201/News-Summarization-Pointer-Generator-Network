It turns out single men and women are looking for the exact same asset when it comes to their prospective dates: Straight, white teeth. 

An exhaustive survey of nearly 5,500 unattached adults ages 21 and older found that to be the case, with nearly 60 percent of men saying they care most about good teeth in a potential date compared to a staggering 71 percent of women who ranked 'teeth' as most important.

Both sexes also listed 'grammar' as the second most important characteristic in a mate, according to the survey by the dating website Match.com.

It turns out single men and women are looking for the exact same asset when it comes to their prospective mates: Straight, white teeth.

After 'teeth' and 'grammar,' came hair, clothes, tattoos and fingernails for what guys pay attention to on women. 

For women, the list was similar, except clothes, hair and nails ranked higher than tattoos.

Survey results for relationship 'must haves' were a bit less superficial.

Men ranked as No. 1: 'Someone I can trust and confide in,' which came second on the women's list after 'Treats me with respect.'

Men also said they are most interested in women who are physically attractive, have a sense of humor and are comfortable with their own sexuality. 

Women, on the other hand, want someone who shares similar values to theirs and is comfortable communicating their needs and desires. 

The least important asset to both men and women in a potential partner is an eagerness to marry, the survey found.
