Are you a messy eater, who always ends up with bits of food or stains splattered on their clothing? 

Then perhaps a new pocket washing machine - believed to be the world's smallest - is the answer to your problems.

The newly designed Coton handy washer, produced by Chinese electronics firm Haier, is the same-size as an electric shaver and can remove anything from dirt to those dreaded red wine stains, according to People's Daily Online.

The handy device can be fitted in a pocket and targets those troublesome stains such as blood, dirt and wine

The Coton device is 176mm high and weighs 200g - the pocket-size gadget is powered by three AAA batteries

It is powered by three AAA batteries and aims to prevent those frustratingly long waits in the dry cleaners by targeting troublesome stains such as coffee, grass or oil. 

The device, created by AQUA (a subsidiary of Haier Group in China), is already flying off the shelves in Japan where it costs 10,800 Yen or £60. 

The portable gadget - which weighs just 200g - uses a method called 'squeeze washing' which removes stains in 30 seconds. 

It works by first applying liquid detergent on a piece of kitchen paper, before washing over it with the nozzle of the Coton device. 

It then pumps a small amount of water over the stain at 700 beats a minute.   

The newly designed gadget has already gone on sale in Japan, where it is proving very popular on the market

Although this pocket-sized device is thought to be the smallest washing machine created, it is not the first invention aimed at cleaning clothes on the go.

In 2013, Australian Ash Newland created the 'Scrubba', a small bag that can wash laundry in just five minutes. 

The £41 wash bag, which looks like nothing more than an average canvas bag, is made from a waterproof material and contains a flexible washboard which cleans away any dirt. 

When three litres of water, liquid soap, and dirty washing are added to the bag, a user has to simply fold and fasten it closed, and rub it to clean the clothes inside.
