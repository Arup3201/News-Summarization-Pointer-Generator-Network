It may not be the obvious choice when looking for a hands-free way to use your phone, but a company in the Netherlands has developed an e-cigarette that can make and receive calls.

Created by Netherlands-based firm Supersmoker, the e-cigarette is the world’s first electronic smoking device to wirelessly connect to smartphones and tablets. 

The Supersmoker Bluetooth has a built-in speaker and microphone and, when connected to a device, can also be used to stream music.

Supersmoker claims the Bluetooth version of its e-cigarette, pictured, is the world's first electronic smoking device to double up as a mobile phone. When wirelessly connected to any Bluetooth device, pictured, the e-cigarette makes and receives calls and can play music

The Supersmoker Bluetooth (pictured right) has a 
built-in microphone fitted to the back of the e-cigarette’s battery, 
while its speaker is fitted in the middle coil.

When
 someone calls the connected phone, Supersmoker users answer it by pressing the 
middle button - holding the speaker to their ear and the microphone near 
their mouth. 

The device can also be used to stream 
music from any connected Bluetooth device, including phones and tablets, but also smart radios, and more. 

Under the battery of the Supersmoker Bluetooth are three buttons.

To activate the e-cigarette's built-in Bluetooth, the middle button is pressed until the battery makes a noise and vibrates.

It can then be paired with any Bluetooth-enabled device.

To end the call, users must press the middle button again.

The
 device can also be used to stream music from the connected smartphone 
or tablet, and volume buttons are located on the bottom of the 
e-cigarette either side of the Bluetooth button.

The
 e-cigarette also comes with a ‘sucker’ and keychain meaning it can be 
stuck, or hung up, in any location when listening to music.

The device costs €79.95 (£65.72) and can be shipped internationally.

Supersmoker said: ‘At Supersmoker we are always striving to make your e-smoking experience more enjoyable, that’s why we created the Supersmoker Bluetooth.

‘With the Supersmoker Bluetooth we are changing the face of the e-smoking lifestyle with cutting edge design.'
