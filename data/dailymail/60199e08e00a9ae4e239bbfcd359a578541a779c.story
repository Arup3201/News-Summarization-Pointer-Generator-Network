A 32-year-old undercover cop has been indicted for gang assault and other serious felonies for taking part in a brutal gang bike attack on a family in their SUV.

Wojciech Braszczok is one of 11 bikers charged in a 14-count indictment over the September 29 attack on Range Rover driver Alexian Lien in Manhattan, New York Daily News reported.

Braszczok, believed to have 'gone rogue' after spending too long undercover, is free on a $150,000 bail bond.

Alongside: A biker matching Braszczok's description can be seen riding next to the rear of the SUV in YouTube videos of the attack

Involvement: Braszczok appears to get off his bike in a YouTube video of the brutal assault

Symbols: Braszczok's jacket bears the insignia of the Front Line Soldiers, a motorcycle club based in New Rochelle, New York, just north of New York City  

The veteran officer will be presented with the indictment at a November 20 arraignment in Manhattan Supreme Court.

Braszczok is also charged with gang assault in
the first degree, assault in the first degree and criminal mischief in 
the third degree.

New York Daily News reported all the bikers except Christopher Cruz face gang assault charges and the possibility of decades in jail.

Cruz, who was rear-ended by Lien, was initially charged in misdemeanor court but now faces felony level criminal mischief and up to four years in prison.

Footage from the September 29 incident shows Braszczok, who was off duty at the time, getting closer and closer to Alexian Lien's car  

Hiding: Braszczok leaves court in New York today with his face hidden after a short hearing into his role in the biker gang assault

Occupy jail: Wojciech Braszczok, 32, was held in custody for his alleged role in the biker gang beating. He has served with NYPD for ten years and was allegedly undercover with Occupy Wall St for five of those

Allen Edwards, who told cops he was trying to stop the 
attack, was also included in the indictment. 

He 'was the voice of reason and was the most reasonable, courageous 
person there, to stand up to these people who he's not friends with. He 
doesn't know these bikers', his lawyer said.

Lien was chased up the West Side Highway and was pulled out of his car 
on W. 178th St. as his wife watched in horror with their young child in 
the back seat.

A YouTube video of the 
attack shows a rider fitting Braszczok's description in the main group 
chasing Alexian Lien's Range Rover. At no point does he try to stop the pursuit.

At around two minutes he surges from the back and positions himself to the left of the vehicle.

His red bike - which looks like the one in Braszczok's online postings - is later seen right behind the SUV boxing it in.

When
Lien stops for the first time the man has moved to its driver's side 
and as one biker tries to open the driver's door, he goes to get off his
bike to assist, but Lien speeds off.

Then he is seen again at the end when Lien is set upon during the second, final confrontation.

Biker punk: Braszczok created a very alternative online persona and he cut his hair in a mohawk to look just like those he was mixing with

The video shows the man believed to be Braszczok apparently pulling up alongside the right of the Range Rover.

His
lawyers in court on October 9 claimed that he never went within 12ft of the vehicle 
but he is much closer than that as his bike comes to a halt by the rear 
window.

Braszczok's defence 
also claimed in court that the window was already broken - but in the 
video it is still intact when he reaches it.

The
court was told that he took part in a 'brutal and brazen' attack and 
that while other members of the bike gang hauled Lien out of his car and
set upon him, Braszczok continued to 'terrorize' his family.

The criminal complaint states that he punched the rear window of the Range Rover, causing it to break.

He
then allegedly kicked the passenger side whilst Lien's wife was sitting
in the front passenger seat and his two-year-old daughter was in the 
back.

Terror: The criminal complaint states that he punched the rear window of the Range Rover, causing it to break. He then allegedly kicked the passenger side whilst Lien's wife was sitting in the front passenger seat and his two-year-old daughter was in the back

Shocking: Braszczok is charged with gang assault in the first degree, assault in the first degree and criminal mischief in the third degree

The criminal
complaint also alleges that at the time of the assault he was wearing a
black vest with the words 'Front Line Soldiers' and 'New Rochelle, NY' 
on it.

His name, 'WOJTEK' was on the front too and he was riding a bright red Yamaha bike.

The description from court appears to match him up in the YouTube video.

The police are said to have another video which shows him actually hitting the windscreen.

Braszczok's
lawyer John Arlia said that videos of the incident will exonerate his 
client who he said was being targeted because he was a detective.

But
despite the seriousness of the claims against him, a judge agreed with 
Braszczok's lawyer that pictures of him in court should not be allowed. 

Mr
Arlia said that he was involved with the NYPD intelligence division 
which deals with 'infiltrating various organizations' and 'to disclose his identity would jeopardize his life, his families'.

For that reason MailOnline has obscured his identity.

The claims emerged on the day it was revealed that Braszczok worked undercover in the Occupy Wall Street movement for two years.

Braszczok
- who also told activists his real name was 'Al' - shaved his head into
a Mohawk and apparently pretended to be a biker bro to win the trust of
activists. He attended demonstrations and lived like the protestors.

Rabble rousing: Braszczok tweeted Occupy events including this 'spring training' event in April, 2012

Rogue? It is unclear how much of Braszczok's online personalities were part of his cover or his genuine lifestyle

Full throttle: Braszczok showed off his bright red Yamaha on his social media accounts - the complaint against him says he was riding one at the time of the incident

Hurt: Alexian Lien needed stitches after he was attacked by bikers in New York as he tried to protect his wife and child. It has now emerged that an undercover cop was part of the group that attacked
