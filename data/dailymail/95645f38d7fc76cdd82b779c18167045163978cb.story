A grieving son set up his own undertaking business so he could carry out his mother's funeral more cheaply.

Mark Roebuck was so disgusted at some of the prices quoted by other funeral companies that he decided to start his own service.

And since setting up Cremdirect last year, he has seen the business go from strength to strength having organised 70 funerals in seven months.

Not coffin up: Mark Roebuck, 44, was so shocked at the prices quoted for his mum Christine's funeral he decided to start his own low-cost undertaking business

Former car salesman Mark, 44, from Stockport, said the loss of his mum Christine in June gave him the idea to start a low-cost undertaking business.

He said: 'I'm not a skinflint but I knew mum would have preferred the money to go elsewhere.

Mr Roebuck's mother Christine passed away in June last year. His company has organised 70 funerals in the past seven months

'I shopped around but I felt some of the prices I was quoted by undertakers were a lot of money for what you received.

'I looked at the costs and said, 'Can I make it for cheaper for people?''

He claims his simple fixed price of £1750 is around £1250 cheaper than the average funeral cost of £3000.

'We just cut out a lot of the unnecessary costs where possible, such as sanitising and embalming,' he said.

'And the price we offer is in proportion to what we do.

'We just keep our overheads down and we have lower day-to-day running costs. When we need a horse, or something like that, we just hire one from elsewhere.'

Mark set up the Cremdirect, which only offers cremations, with business partner Adrian Tweedie and they have offices in Manchester and Stockport, Wilmslow and Macclesfield in Cheshire, and Buxton and the High Peak area in Derbyshire.

'Our profit margins are small,' he said. 'But we believe we offer good service for families.'
