Throwing down the gauntlet: Jimmy Kimmell slams Jay Leno as a washed-up has-been who hasn't been funny in 20 years. Oh, and he also called him a sell-out

Late-night upstart Jimmy Kimmel may have them rolling in the aisles during show, 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!'

But the ABC funnyman reserved his most biting barbs for Jay Leno, recently repudiating the 'Tonight Show's' hoary-haired humorist as a has-been, or, 'a master chef who opened a Burger King.'

'Leno hasn’t been a good stand-up in 20 years,' Kimmel said in a new Rolling Stone cover-story, an advanced copy of which The New York Daily News obtained. 'As a comedian, you can’t not have disdain for what he’s done: He totally sold out.'

Kimmel, who was apparently smoked copious ganja with the Rolling Stone scribe during his stoned-out tet-e-tet with the magazine, was more complimentary of David Letterman, his childhood idol.

'If I beat David Letterman in the ratings, does that mean I’m better than Letterman? No f***ing way,' he said.

Kimmel also praised Leno’s NBC colleague, Jimmy Fallon, who hosts 'Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.'

Show some respect!: Kimmel, among other things, said Leno had sold out in response to an inquiry about the quality of the latter's stand-up sets at a Los Angeles nightclub

Long-time feud: This is the first time that Kimmel has ran afoul of Leno, as the late-night upstart has hammered him on numerous occasions going back to 2010

Burgeoning rivalry: Kimmel called Leno's NBC late-night colleague, Jimmy Fallon, a 'very worthy competitor' to whom he will inevitably be compared for years to come

Late-night wars: The attacks come just days before Kimmel moves his show to the same time slot, 11.35pm ET, as Leno's long-running 'Tonight Show'

'People are going to compare me and him 
for years to come — we’re being positioned as the Leno and Letterman of 
the next round,' Kimmel reportedly said. 'I like it because he’s a very 
worthy competitor.'

Kimmel's
acerbic assaults on Leno - which lent the Rolling stone interview the 
same air as a hyped prizefight's weigh-in - come only days before he 
moves his show  from midnight to the coveted 11:35pm ET slot, where it will directly compete in the ratings with Leno's 'Tonight Show'

Specifically,
the sallies concerning Leno were offered mostly in reply to the Rolling
Stone scribe's question concerning the quality of Leno's recent sets at
Los Angeles's 'Comedy & Magic

Club.'However, Kimmel apparently didn't need 
an excuse to let fly on the established funnyman. Having long held Leno 
in contempt, Kimmel recently compared him to a weapon-wielding zombie 
who just won't die.

Here's the dope: Kimmel was apparently smoking dope with the Rolling stone scribe when he blitzed Leno in the magazine

'Jay Leno is not going to be able to stay on television forever, and obviously Jimmy Fallon is the heir apparent,' Kimmel reportedly said.

'And [Fallon is] doing a great job, so it makes sense people would talk like this. That said, you can never count Jay out. He seems to pop up just when you think he's dead -- he comes alive and he's got a hatchet.'

 Leno hasn’t been a good stand-up in 20 
years. As a comedian, you can’t 
not have disdain for what he’s done: He totally sold out.

According to ABC News, Kimmel in 2010 offered audiences an unflattering impersonation of Leno on his show. He also chastised Leno for planning a return to 'The Tonight Show' after Conan O'Brien was forced out as the show's host the same year. And last year, at a New York City event, Kimmel said of Leno, “F*** him.”

The issue of Rolling Stone featuring Kimmel hits newsstands Friday.

Leno has taken some hits of late from other comedy corners. None other than David Letterman recently weighed in, paying him a very backhanded compliment during a televised interview with Oprah.

'I will say, and I'm happy to say, that I think he is the funniest guy I've ever known,' Letterman reportedly said of Leno.

'Just flat out, if you go see him do his nightclub act, just the funniest, the smartest, a wonderful observationist and very appealing as a comic. Therefore, the fact that he is also maybe the most insecure person I have ever known - I could never reconcile that.'
