From Twilight to Star Wars, fans of sci fi and fantasy franchises are known for their levels of dedication. They immerse themselves in the world of their favourite characters by dressing up as them, collecting the merchandise and even going to conventions to meet others who share their passion.

But some take it even further than this, spending thousands of pounds and travelling the world in pursuit of the actors who brought their favourite character to life.

It's something actor Tom Felton, 27, is familiar with having grown up on screen playing Draco Malfoy in the Harry Potter series.

Tina Davies has been a fan of Tom Felton and his Harry Potter co-stars for years and has collected their autographs by meeting them at events and premieres over the last 15 years

He was only 12 when he found fame thanks to the JK Rowling books being turned into films and when he started going on the publicity trail to promote the films, he noticed a certain fan was always there.

Her name was Tina Davies and she would be waiting for him outside hotels, film premieres and events he attended desperate for a glimpse of the star and hopefully a picture or autograph.

Tom said: 'Tina follows me to every event I attend. I'm sure she has the best intentions but it is a little unnerving. 

'I first spotted her when I had a press tour in Paris and I noticed this women following me around, she seemed to have an obsession with me and always seems to know where I am.

'Why does a middle-aged woman have an obsession with back then, a teenage boy?'

He added that he knows Tina means no harm and he finds her 'sweet' but he said: 'She has followed my career for seven years, ultimately I am baffled as to why she wants to see me and what she wants from me.'

Once, Tina, 56, from Swindon, waited for four hours outside an event he was attending to give him a card telling him she was sorry his dog had died after the star revealed he'd lost a pet on social media.

So intrigued as to why Tina follows him around the world at her own time and expense, Tom decided to investigate the psyche behind the superfan for a BBC documentary that airs on BBC Three tonight.

He even visited Tina's house and, surrounded by signed pictures of himself and posters of his friends and Harry Potter co-stars, he learnt why he has come to mean so much to Tina.

She explained: 'I went out and brought the first one after that, that was it, it spiralled.

'When I saw Chamber Of Secrets and saw this blonde slimy git after Harry, I thought ummm I'm going to start watching him. I think to start off with it was the character Draco I liked and then gradually I got to like you, you're lovely.

Tina said the actors feel like family to her because she has watched them grow up on screen

Tina said she has enjoyed watching Tom grow up from being a boy as Draco Malfoy in the first Harry Potter films, left, to the man he is today, right

'I wanted the autographs to feel closer to you, it was like a little connection. I have never had a family and following Harry Potter and watching you all grow up it was like seeing my own family grow up and I got attached. You seemed like a big family and I wanted to be part of that.'

Tom got a taste of just what this is like when he joined fans outside a Broadway theatre to catch a glimpse of Rupert Grint aka Ron Weasley. He experienced the excitement, anticipation and the buzz the fans get from meeting their favourite star.  

He spoke to his Harry Potter friends and co-stars and author JK Rowling to see how they have dealt with this kind of attention. 

Harry Potter himself, actor Daniel Radcliffe, said: 'It's definitely a weird thing when are aware you account for a large part of someone's life who you don't know and who doesn't know you - but thinks they do. 

'Having an obsession with a character in a book is fine but when you are obsessed with someone you don't have anything about... I'm more comfortable with people being obsessed with Harry Potter than obsessed with me.'

 

Actor Tom Felton meets Steve, the 'world's biggest Harry Potter fan' who has spent thousands on merchandise and even has JK Rowling's autograph tattooed on his arm

Tom tried to get inside the heads of superfans by joining in a Star Wars convention

On the show he also meets other Harry Potter superfans and learns that many of them have found solace in the world of Hogwarts when their own lives have been difficult.

In Pittsburgh he meets Steve who calls himself  the 'world's biggest Harry Potter fan'. 

He has spent $13,000 (£8,756) on merchandise he has been collecting for 15 years and has so many Harry Potter costumes, he can wear Harry Potter clothes every day for three months without wearing same thing twice. 

Steve told Tom his obsession started when he was bullied at school. 'I didn't fit in, I was a skinny nerd who liked to dance rather than play baseball. I really identified with who Harry is.'

But the film fan admitted it's the characters, not the actors who play them, he loves but most of all he adores writer JK Rowling. So much so that he has her signature tattooed on his forearm.

The actor also dressed up as Batman's The Joker to experience the thrill of being a fan

He said: 'If JK Rowling walked through the door now you would see me lose it completely, shaking, crying freaking out. I went to New York in 2006 to see her and she signed my arm and I got it tattooed over.' 

The author herself had her own theory on why readers become so obsessed with her books.

She said: 'You can travel every deeply into why as a society you need famous people. I totally get the Potter thing as your childhood and teen years are such an important formative part of your life and the things that matter do you then, stay with you.'
