As third in line to the throne, Prince George will have been inundated with gifts from all over the world this Christmas. 

But the young royal is proving easy to please - one of his favourite festive presents cost under £10. 

Pippa Middleton bought her 17-month-old nephew a soft toy police car from Chelsea Toys in London for just £9 and he is said to be delighted with the cuddly item.

Pippa Middleton bought a soft toy for £9 from Chelsea Toys in London for Christmas. Prince George is said to be particularly delighted with the gift

The store owner Alka Poole said: ‘She was looking for a small gift because she’d already bought him a massive thing. 

‘She just needed something to give him to play with.' 

The soft toy police car was a top-up to a larger offering Pippa had purchased for her nephew

Although Pippa has yet to be pictured holding the prince, she has been very vocal about her adoration of the royal toddler.

She told American programme the Today show in July: 'He's amazing, a very dear boy. 

'He has brought a lot of pleasure and fun for all of us, the whole family.'

Despite her busy schedule, Pippa pays regular visits to George and her sister The Duchess of Cambridge at their Kensington Palace apartment. 

The siblings have always been extremely close and Pippa's frequent contact with her nephew shows that the Middleton family are continuing with their attitude to strong family ties with the next generation. 

She said earlier this year: 'We spend a lot of time together. 

'We still do a lot together as a family.

'And I think that's really the heart for all of us is having a really close family that we can sort of be normal with each other, treat each other normally.

'And that's sort of kept us all, you know, affixed to the ground.'

Although Pippa has more contact with George than most of Kate and William's close friends, she wasn't among the seven people chosen as his godparent.

It is thought that the royal couple believed she was struggling to cope with the amount of public attention she has received since the royal wedding and they felt the new role would pile on even more pressure.

Pippa is widely expected to be named as a godmother to Kate's second child though, which is due in April.
