A search will resume on Sunday morning for a young boy who went missing on the Murray River on Saturday.

Around 2.30pm on Saturday, police were called to a campsite on Gunbower Island in Koondrook, Victoria, after a six-year-old boy went missing while swimming in the Murray River. 

The boy had been swimming with six other children when they all started to drift downstream at a campsite on Gunbower Island is Koondrook, Victoria.

Four of the children managed to get themselves out of the water, but the other three began to struggle against the current.

Several adults jumped into the water and managed to rescue two of the children out but were unable to locate the six-year-old boy.

A search – involving NSW Police, Victoria Police, NSW SES, NSW Maritime, NSW Volunteer Rescue Association, NSW Police Divers and a number of civilians – commenced immediately. 

The search for the missing boy continued to about 10.30pm last night, however ceased due to poor visibility. The search will resume about 8am this morning (Sunday 28 December 2014).

NSW Police Divers are currently on their way to the location to assist with the search.

Gunbower Island is located in the Gunbower National Park, and is a popular tourist destination for fishing, swimming, and boating. 

In 2010, a toddler drowned in the Gunbower Creek after wandering away from the two adults he was with.

They found him floating in the river and performed CPR on him until an ambulance arrived, but paramedics were not able to revive him.
