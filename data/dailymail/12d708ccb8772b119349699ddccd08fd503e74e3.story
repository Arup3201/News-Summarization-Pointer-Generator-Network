It sounds like the punchline to a joke but meet Jeffrey - the pet camel who loves to down pints of lager.

The 11ft-tall bactrian's favourite tipples are bottles of Budweiser and Coors shipped in to his home in Sutton-on-the-Forest, north Yorkshire from his local gastropub.

Jeffrey, who requires a wild animal licence is believed to be Britain's only pet camel, with others in the UK kept as part of commercial or tourist ventures.

Punchline: Jeffrey the pet camel, pictured with his owner racehorse trainer Simon Grant loves to down pints of lager

Tipple: The 11ft-tall bactrian's favourite tipples are bottles of Budweiser and Coors shipped in to his home in Sutton-on-the-Forest, north Yorkshire from his local gastropub

Training: Mr Grant, a former jockey and racehorse trainer, has since schooled the camel so he lies down and stands up on demand and can be ridden around their 50-acre property

The imposing Russian camel, who 
can survive temperatures as low as -25C, was imported from Holland seven
 years ago as a 19th birthday present for Elizabeth Grant's son Tom.

'Tom happened to mention in passing that he liked camels and I managed to track one down,' said vet Mrs Grant, who cares for Jeffrey at her £2million home.

'He definitely wasn't expecting that. It was quite a surprise.

Special treat: As a treat Jeffrey, who cost £3,000 and was four-years-old when he arrived at the farm, is allowed to enjoy a pint or two of beer from the local gastropub

Embrace: The imposing Russian camel, who can survive temperatures as low as -25C, was imported from Holland seven years ago as a 19th birthday present for Mr Grant's son Tom

Once of the family: Jeffrey, who requires a wild animal licence is believed to be Britain's only pet camels, with others in the UK kept as part of commercial or tourist ventures

Drinking buddies: Elizabeth Grant had read that camels like beer, and so decided to let Jeffrey have a taste

'I read that camels like beer so I thought I'd see if Jeffrey did and he loves it. The landlord of the local pub brings the beer up here for Jeffrey.'

Mrs Grant's husband Simon, a former jockey and racehorse trainer, has since schooled the camel so he lies down and stands up on demand and can be ridden around their 50-acre property.

Jeffrey also responds to having his name called.

As a treat Jeffrey, who cost £3,000 and 
was four-years-old when he arrived at the farm, is allowed to enjoy a 
pint or two of beer from the local pub The Rose and Crown, which is added to Jeffrey's feed.

The Bactrian camel is the rarer of the two camel species (the other being the dromedary) and is recognisable by its two humps - which store large amounts of fat anabling the camel to survive for long periods without water.

Bactrians are pack animals and traditionally found in dry regions. 

There are around two million Bactrians - most of which are domesticated, with a population of just 800 believed to be living in the wild, mostly in remote regions of Mongolia and China, migrating to rivers in Siberia during winter.

Bactrians are known for their tolerance for cold, drought, and high altitudes, and although they prefer a diet of plants, the highly adaptable animals will feed on anything they can find, including bones and sometimes even rope or tents.

They also eat snow to provide them with water, but beer-drinking camels are not unusual with some racing animals given it (in moderation) to make them livelier.

The Grants said he was in a sorry state upon arrival but, thanks to good living on grass, horse feed plus his weekend pint, he has shot up and is now thriving.

'He was much smaller when we got him and his humps were floppy,' said Mrs Grant.

'Now they are high and firm, which mean he's in great health.'

Mr and Mrs Grant, who have two grown-up children, Tom and Emily, have now put their luxury home on the market, and estate agents Carter Jonas are wondering whether to inform viewers of the property's USP or leave him and his pals as a pleasant surprise when they look around.

As well as Jeffrey the couple also have horses, llamas, geese, goats, Murphy the donkey, Bertie the sheep, two pigs named Bangers and Mash, seven dogs, nine cats and three Highland cattle.

Mrs Grant, who runs Longbridge Veterinary Services, said: 'It's like a zoo here and all the animals we have are pets.

'We thought he'd like to be with the llamas as they're from the camelid family but he hates them.

'He loves his cows and they love him. He is adorable and just looking at him makes you smile.'

The pets will all move with the family when they downsize, although Tom, now 26, who is moving to his own home, has now outgrown his birthday present.

'He jokes that we'd better not leave Jeffery to him in our will,' said Mrs Grant.

'If they're well looked after, camels can live until they're 60.'
