Britain will invest £180million over the next ten years in defending the Falkland Islands against a ‘very live’ threat from Argentina, Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said today.

The announcement comes amid fears of an invasion after it emerged Vladimir Putin could be helping to re-arm the South American nation by leasing them 12 long-range bombers.

Mr Fallon said Britain’s military presence on the South Atlantic territory would be ‘beefed up’ following the findings of a review by top brass.

There are fears of an invasion of the Falklands after it emerged Vladimir Putin could be helping to re-arm the South American nation by leasing them 12 long-range bombers

But later he told MPs that there would be no more troops or fighter planes sent to the British territory after the review found UK’s military forces were at the ‘level required’ to ensure its protection against any threat.

Instead the UK would ‘modernise’ its defences in the region by investing in some of the ‘ageing infrastructure’, as a well as upgrading a surface-to-air missile system.

His comments come amid claims there is a heightened risk of invasion by Argentina. Mr Putin is understood to be working on a deal to lease 12 Sukhoi Su-24 long range bombers to the country.

Former defence minister Sir Gerald Howarth said the reported deal with Putin was ‘very serious’.

He said: ‘It is very serious indeed. Putin has many problems at home and yet he is ramping up tension in the Falklands.

‘Our policy has been to deter Argentina from repeating the folly of 1982. When you have a volatile political leadership, that is when things can get very dangerous.

‘The decision to invest £180million and continue with ground based air defences is welcome.’

The long-running dispute over the sovereignty of the British overseas territory has surfaced again in recent years under the presidency of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner.

Speaking before he addressed MPs in the Commons, Mr Fallon told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme: ‘The threat remains. It is a very live threat. We have to respond to it.

‘We do need to modernise our defences to ensure that we have sufficient troops there and that the islanders have the right to remain British and the right to proper protection by our forces.

‘It is our general view that the threat has not reduced.’

However in the Commons he admitted that no more troops would be sent, nor would any more fighter jets be deployed after a review concluded current defence of the garrison was sufficient.

He told MPs: ‘I have endorsed the assessment… that the current military presence is broadly proportionate to the threats and risks we face.

‘Our forces in the South Atlantic are entirely defensive, and are at a level required to ensure the defence of the Falkland Islands against any potential threat.

‘For the foreseeable future we will keep our numbers at around their current levels of about 1,200 personnel, military and civilian.’

Britain must build up its defence capabilities  in response to the threat posed by Russian President Vladimir Putin. There are claims he is ramping up tensions in in the Falklands, which have been heightened in recent years under the presidency of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner

A source said: ‘I think the defence secretary meant to say “modernising” rather than “beefing up”.’

Amid threats from Argentina, Mr Fallon said the Army would deploy two RAF Chinook helicopters which were used in Afghanistan and which would replace the search and rescue Sea King helicopters already in the region.

The helicopters would enable the islands’ garrison to mount a ‘swift and decisive response’ to ‘any emerging incidents’, it was said.

He also announced the UK would deliver enhanced operational communications to better ‘enable to the sharing of real time operational data’.

Britain will also renew the ground based air defence system when Rapier, a surface-to-air missile system, comes out of service around the end of the decade, he said.

The Falkland Islands Patrol Vessel, HMS Clyde, would also remain in the region. ‘We should not drop our guard’, he told MPs, insisting the UK was ‘not complacent’ and the Government would continue to remain ‘vigilant’.

£180million would also be used to improve the quality of life of those in the Falklands, including improving accommodation and a new primary school.

A number of projects will be carried out to replace some of the ‘ageing infrastructure’, including the refurbishment of Mare Harbour and the replacement of the existing power generation systems.

A major modernisation of the fuels infrastructure is also underway, he said.

But only four RAF Typhoon jets are stationed there permanently and there are no plans to increase those numbers, Mr Fallon admitted.

His comments to the House came after he told Sky News: ‘I’m going to be announcing to Parliament later today how we’re going to beef up defences there, how we’re going to modernise our defences.

He added that he intended ‘to reassure the islanders that we’re absolutely committed to their right to remain British and to the defence of the islands’.
