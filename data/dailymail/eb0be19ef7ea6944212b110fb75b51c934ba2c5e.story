Manchester United have taken two 15-year-old Benfica starlets on trial.

Highly rated winger Joao Filipe arrived at United's Carrington Training Complex on Tuesday for training as coaches run the rule over the youngster.

And Joao Virginia, a goalkeeper, is also training with United as the Old Trafford club steal a march on their European rivals.Â 

Top signing: Joao Filipe (seconjd right) grabs a lift into Manchester United's training complex at Carrington

Ages: 15

Height: 5ft5in

Position: Winger, ability to anywhere in attack

Current club: Benfica

Idols: Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Neymar

The Reds have been tracking Filipe for six months, with the youngster also being followed by Catalan giants Barcelona.

Benfica are attempting to seal long-term deals for the two players but they are facing major competition across the continent.

Many teenagers are handed trials by United throughout the year and they do not always result in prolonged interest.

However, in the case of these two players, United may firm up their interest sooner rather than later with Filipe and Viriginia among the brightest prospects to emerge from Portugal in recent times.

When asked about the two players, United said that they never comment on trialists at the club.
