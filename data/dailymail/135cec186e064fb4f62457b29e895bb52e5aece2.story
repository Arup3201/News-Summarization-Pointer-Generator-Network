An Army private charged with leaking classified material to WikiLeaks
said Friday that he tied a bedsheet into a noose while considering 
suicide during his pretrial confinement in Kuwait.

Pfc. Bradley Manning testified on the fourth day of a pretrial 
hearing at Fort Meade near Baltimore.

Manning testified under 
cross-examination that he made the noose in Kuwait before he was moved 
to a Marine Corps brig in Quantico, Va.

Goal: Manning said his pre-trial punishment was so severe he fashioned a noose and considered suicide

He claims that his treatment 
later at Quantico was so harsh that the charges against him should be 
dismissed.

He arrived at Quantico classified as a suicide risk. Eight days 
later, he was upgraded to the less-restrictive "prevention of injury" 
status.

Manning maintains that neither designation was appropriate because he didn't feel like hurting himself after leaving Kuwait.

Under questioning by prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein, Manning said that 
upon arrival at Quantico in July 2010, he was told he would be processed
into the brig as a suicide risk.

He said he noted on his intake form 
that he had considered suicide.

He also wrote on the form that he was 'always planning and never acting' upon suicidal thoughts.

In court Thursday he talked about his feelings while being held.

'I was in a pretty stressed 
situation...I was getting very little information' from his attorney 
while he was being held, he said, noting that he felt increasingly 
‘hopeless’.

He said he remembers thinking 'I'm going to die, I'm stuck inside this cage.'

'I had pretty much given up. My world had
just shrunk,' Manning said, explaining how he had suicidal thoughts 
while being held by authorities.'I totally started to fall apart.'

In January 2011, after complaining about his custody classification, 
Manning met with a board of officers that made custody status 
recommendations.

He said when he was asked about the statement on his 
intake form about planning and never acting, he told the board that he 
might have lied.

'I did say it might have been a sarcastic answer,' Manning said. 'I 
told them today, the end of January 2011, I'm not suicidal. I'm not 
trying to harm myself or anything like that.'

The testimony marked the first time military prosecutors went face-to-face with Manning.

He spoke publicly Thursday for the first time since his May 2010 
arrest, saying he got so used to leg irons and being locked up 23 hours a
day that when he was finally transferred to medium-security confinement
at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., in April 2011, he felt uneasy moving freely 
around the cell block.

'There was the sense of, 'OK, I know they're going to put the hammer 
down on me soon,'' Manning said near the end of his five hours on the 
witness stand.

Besides being classified 'maximum custody,' Manning was subjected to 
additional restraints during his nine months at Quantico.

Commanders 
maintained the extra restrictions despite repeated recommendations by 
brig psychiatrists that they be eased.

They included scratchy, 
suicide-prevention bedding and sometimes having all his clothing, 
eyeglasses and reading material removed from his cell.

The military contends the treatment was proper.

At one point during his testimony Thursday, Manning donned a 
dark-green, suicide-prevention smock resembling an oversized tank top 
made of stiff, thick fabric.

He said it was similar to one he was issued
in March 2011, several days after Quantico jailers started requiring 
him to surrender all his clothing and eyeglasses each night as a 
suicide-prevention measure.

This occurred after he told them — out of 
frustration, he said — that if he really wanted to hurt himself, he 
could have done so with his underwear waistband or flip-flops.

The 5-foot-3 soldier looked youthful in his dark-blue dress uniform, 
close-cropped hair and rimless eyeglasses.

He was animated, often 
speaking in emphatic bursts, swiveling in the witness chair and 
gesturing with his hands.

Also Thursday, the military judge, Army Col. Denise Lind, accepted 
the terms under which Manning may plead guilty to eight of the 22 
charges he faces.

Coombs revealed the plea offer in early November, 
saying it would enable Manning to take responsibility for sending U.S. 
secrets to WikiLeaks.

Lind hasn't formally accepted the pleas but has indicated she will consider them at a hearing starting Dec. 10.

Under the offer, Manning would plead guilty to certain charges as 
violations of military regulations rather than as violations of federal 
espionage and computer security laws.

The offenses would then carry 
maximum prison terms totaling 16 years rather than 72.

The pleas would include admissions that Manning sent WikiLeaks 
classified memos, Iraq and Afghanistan war logs, Guantanamo Bay prison 
records and a 2007 video clip of a U.S. helicopter crew gunning down 11 
men later found to have included a Reuters news photographer and his 
driver.

The video, titled 'Collateral Murder' on WikiLeaks, garnered 
worldwide attention.

The Pentagon concluded the troops acted 
appropriately during the attack, having mistaken the camera equipment 
for weapons.

The government could still prosecute Manning for all 22 counts he 
faces, including aiding the enemy. That offense carries a maximum 
penalty of life in prison.

Manning is accused of engineering the biggest leak of classified 
material in U.S. history.

Besides the video, he is charged with sending 
hundreds of thousands of classified Iraq and Afghanistan war logs and 
more than 250,000 diplomatic cables to WikiLeaks while working as an 
intelligence analyst in Baghdad in 2009 and 2010.
