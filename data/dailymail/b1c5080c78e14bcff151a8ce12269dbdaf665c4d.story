A school field has been invaded by travellers who have set up camp just days after the summer holidays started.

The five caravans and a number of cars and vans parked up on the playing fields at the front of Salendine Nook High School Academy, in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire.

They appeared on Monday morning. Now residents fear the fields will be left in disrepair.

The camp moved on to sports fields at the front of Salendine Nook High School Academy on Monday morning. Five caravans and a number of cars and vans parked up

Bobby Charlesworth, who lives nearby, said: 'Here is a great example of how these rights are used to trespass, break and enter and flytip.

'I just wish politicians would stand up for ordinary people who’s lives are made a misery through actions like these.'

Daniel Sparkes said: 'Want a sure-fire bet? When they finally leave, the school’s playing fields will look like a rubbish dump, because they never take their rubbish away with them.

'Mind you, perhaps today’s travellers are a bit better off - there’s at least 1 Audi estate, and not an old heap at that. Where’s the money come from for that?'

Kirklees Council is investigating the incident after residents complained the school field would be damaged 

A spokesman for Kirklees Council said: 'We understand the school are going to the courts for a possession order'

One resident stuck up for the travellers, saying: 'They would not have to camp there if there was proper facilities for them'

Alan Boorman said: 'Whenever this happens the Police, benefits agency, uk border agency should be on them like a ton of bricks, checking vehicle details, outstanding warrants, right of abode, county court judgements, driving licences and insurance because there is no area these people will not fill with rubbish, abuse people living in the area and generally spoil.

'If I just decided to pitch a tent on school grounds I would be removed in an instant and the same rules should apply to everyone.'

But Marie Norman spoke against the negative comments and said: 'I’m no traveller but I will stick up for them. Not all are bad and don’t trespass, break and enter and fly tip.

'Actually more often than not there some of the cleanest people more than those ‘normal’ ones in houses they would not have to camp there if there was proper facilities for them.'

A spokesman for Kirklees Council said: 'The land is not owned by the council, it is owned by Huddersfield New College.

'We understand the school are going to the courts for a possession order. We will not be making any further comment.'

Huddersfield New College were not available for comment.
