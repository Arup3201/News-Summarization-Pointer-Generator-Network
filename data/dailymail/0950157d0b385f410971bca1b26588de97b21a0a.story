Scotland could be on the verge of voting for independence in the upcoming referendum on its future in the Union after a recent poll showed the gap between rival campaigns had almost closed.

The dismal polling for unionists has led to senior Tories to push for Alistair Darling to be sidelined as head of the campaign to keep Scotland in the UK, amid growing concerns about his performance.

Members of David Cameron's inner circle are increasingly alarmed that the lacklustre Better Together movement run by the former Labour chancellor could hand victory to the Scottish nationalists.

One poll yesterday found the pro-independence Yes campaign, which once trailed by a wide margin, is now only three points behind – raising the prospect of a majority vote to break up the union in September.

Senior Tories are pointing the finger at Mr Darling, who was initially seen as a safe pair of hands.

They accept the campaign cannot be led by a Conservative, but believe a more charismatic Labour figure such as former home secretary John Reid should be recruited to take on SNP leader Alex Salmond.

A senior Tory source said: 'Alistair Darling's true colours have come through now – he's a middlingly competent accountant with zero charisma.

'You never see him. Where is the big figure to lead the campaign and take the fight to Salmond? It's just dismal at the moment.'

The faltering performance of the No side of the debate is said to be causing bitter infighting in the Better Together organisation.

A source said factions were 'barely talking to each other'.

Better Together is also struggling to compete financially, following an intervention by EuroMillions winners Colin and Chris Weir.

The couple, who won £161million in 2011, are reported to have given a total of £3million to the Yes campaign and the SNP during the past 15 months, dwarfing contributions to the No campaign.

Blair Jenkins, of the pro-independence drive, said: 'The extreme negativity of the No campaign is proving a major turn-off for voters and month by month they are paying the price.'
