Former NFL star Darren Sharper has been sentenced to nine years in federal prison after he pleaded guilty to sexually assaulting a woman in Arizona.  

Sharper on Monday admitted to charges of sexual assault and attempted sexual assault arising from the 2013 Arizona case.

He appeared in the Phoenix courtroom by video-conferencing from Los Angeles.

Sharper also is expected to change his plea in person in Los Angeles on similar allegations. Similar hearings will follow in Las Vegas this week and in New Orleans in April.

The Arizona and California cases, combined with others in Nevada and Louisiana, are likely to lead to a long prison sentence. 

In each state, Sharper was accused of drugging and sexually assaulting women when they were unconscious or otherwise unable to resist or consent. 

Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Warren Granville said Sharper will serve his time in federal custody and that the Louisiana case will be resolved through a federal court.

In Arizona, Sharper admitted sexually assaulting one victim, though police say he drugged and sexually assaulted three women, at an apartment in the Phoenix suburb of Tempe in November.

The 39-year-old was part of the New Orleans Saints side which won the NFL Super Bowl XLIV in 2010

Authorities say a search of the Tempe apartment turned up a shot glass with a white residue that turned out to be zolpidem, and California investigators discovered that Sharper had a prescription for the drug.

Last year, Sharper's attorneys said their client did not make the drinks that authorities say he used to drug the women.

One of the women told police she hadn't had any alcohol that night until Sharper insisted she drink a shot. 

Another young woman said she had been drugged, then went to bed, locked her door and wasn't attacked.

The next day, one of the women confronted Sharper, who denied wrongdoing, according to the reports.

The reports said Sharper was in Arizona to visit a woman who lived at the apartment. The two had met about a year earlier in Las Vegas.  

Sharper is a former defensive back for the New Orleans Saints and other teams.
