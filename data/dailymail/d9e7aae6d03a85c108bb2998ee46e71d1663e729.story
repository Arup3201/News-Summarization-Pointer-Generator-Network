Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has been ruled out Saturday's game against QPR after picking up a calf injury in Wednesday night's defeat against CSKA Moscow.

The Belgian joins David Silva and Aleksandar Kolarov on the treatment table as City try to bounce back from their Champions League embarrassment - giving a rare chance for £32million summer signing Eliaquim Mangala.

Either Yaya Toure or Pablo Zabaleta will captain the team at Loftus Road in Kompany's absence.

Boss Manuel Pellegrini confirmed: 'Kompany has a calf problem. I don't think it is too serious but he will not play on Saturday and I don't know if he will be ready for his national squad next week.

'Maybe not but at the moment it is difficult to say. We will get the doctors' opinion on it too.'
