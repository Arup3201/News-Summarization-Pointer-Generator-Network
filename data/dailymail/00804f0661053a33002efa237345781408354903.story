Andy Murray fought from a set down to defeat Jerzy Janowicz 6-7 (11/9) 6-4 6-2 and book his place in the second round of the China Open.

Murray, who defeated Spain's Tommy Robredo on Sunday to win the Shenzhen Open - his first tournament victory since winning Wimbledon last year, looked out of sorts in the opening set before firing back to give Janowicz a real contest.

After going 5-1 up only for Murray to hit back, the Pole went on to claim the first set on a tie-break.

The second set went Murray's way thanks to a single break of Janowicz in the ninth game before he dominated the third to claim victory.

Murray started off in the worst possible fashion as he was broken by Janowicz in the first game of the match before the Pole claimed a 2-0 lead.

Janowicz raced to a 3-0 advantage after he took the first of two break points on the Murray serve.

However, while the Scot broke back immediately he was not able to hold his serve for the third consecutive game and slump to a 4-1 deficit.

Janowicz then moved 5-1 ahead but Murray hit back, claiming four games in a row to draw level at 5-5.

The Scot won his first service game of the match to stay in the first set before a break of serve saw him claim back-to-back games.

Murray served out the next before breaking Janowicz, although his momentum stuttered in the next, as he trailed 30-0 on serve before firing back to claim a 6-5 lead - the first time he was ahead in the match.

Janowicz then served to love to take the first set to a tie-break, which was hotly contested with the duo matching each other all the way until the Pole found a way through to win 11-9.

It meant that if he were to win, Murray would need to battle back from a set down for his third match in a row.

The second set went on serve until the ninth game, where the number six seed broke Janowicz to take a 5-4 lead before taking the set 6-4.

It meant the game went into a decider and an early break for Murray saw him go 3-1 up, before another saw him move 5-2 ahead and just one game away from a place in the second round.

Murray then served for the match and claimed a battling victory in a match time of two hours and 28 minutes to line up a second-round meeting with American John Isner.
