Norway international Martin Odegaard has become the youngest player to start a European Championship qualifier.

The Real Madrid star, aged 16 years and 101 days, started for his country in their Group H tie against Croatia on Saturday.

Odegaard previously became the youngest footballer to play in a Euro qualifier when he came on as a substitute against Bulgaria at the age of 15 years and 300 days.

The game did not start well though, as Croatia took the lead after half an hour. Marcelo Brozovic was the scorer as the group leaders went ahead once more.

Going into the game, Croatia had not lost any of their opening four fixtures, and they continued that run, eventually winning 5-1 and brushing Norway aside with ease.

Odegaard, although unable to stop his country from losing on Saturday, is a talented young forward with a big future ahead of him. He joined Real Madrid in January, and has been plying his trade with Castilla, Madrid's reserve side.
