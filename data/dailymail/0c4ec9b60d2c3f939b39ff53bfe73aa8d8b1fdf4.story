Sergio Aguero has told friends he will be out for a month after damaging knee ligaments in Manchester City’s 1-0 win over Everton on Saturday.

The Argentina striker is out of the decisive Champions League clash at Roma on Wednesday and also fears he will miss the next five Premier League games plus an FA Cup third round tie.

City will allow the swelling around Aguero’s knee to go down for up to 48 hours before he goes for a scan. Only then will they know exactly how long the striker will be out, but Aguero has privately expressed his fears after saying ‘he felt something strange happen inside’ the joint.

City boss Manuel Pellegrini, however, refuted suggestions that the Premier League champions are over-reliant on a striker who has already scored 19 goals this season.

‘We would prefer to play with Sergio but I don’t think he has carried us,’ said Pellegrini.

‘I suppose Ronaldo is very important for Real Madrid and Messi is very important for Barcelona, but neither of those teams are all about just one player.’

City hope David Silva will be able to play in Rome, and will give captain Vincent Kompany until tomorrow’s final training session to prove his fitness.
