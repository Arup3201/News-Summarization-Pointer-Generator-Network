They spent months together inside their mother's womb. But twins Axel and Alfie Perkins do not share a birthday - because they were born five days apart.

The boys, who will soon celebrate their second birthday, were born at just 24 weeks after their mother Emma Day went into premature labour.

But after giving birth to Axel - and expecting Alfie any minute - Miss Day's cervix inexplicably closed.

Alfie (left) and Axel (right) Perkins are twins but they were born five days apart. Axel was born on July 19, 2012 and Alfie followed on July 24. Axel was born when their mother was just 24 weeks pregnant

She said: ‘A doctor gave me an inspection and was amazed. Axel’s placenta and Alfie were still stuck inside.

‘I
 had to wait five more days before I went into labour again. I went down
 to be by Axel’s incubator while I was still pregnant with Alfie.

‘It was so strange to be there with my newborn son, while I was still pregnant.’

Axel arrived on July 19, 2012 weighing just 1lb 12oz and required emergency treatment to keep him alive. He was wrapped in plastic to keep him warm and rushed to a specialist care unit.

Alfie was delivered on July 24, weighing just under 2lb.

The boys had almost arrived even earlier, after Miss Day’s waters broke when she was just 21 weeks pregnant.

She said: ‘I felt two huge gushes and rushed to hospital immediately. Once I was there, I was told that my waters had broken.

‘A
 team of neonatal specialists attended to me and told me that if the 
boys started to arrive there and then, they were almost certain not to 
survive.

After Axel's birth, Miss Day's cervix inexplicably closed again. As a result, Alfie (pictured) was not born immediately as expected. He was delivered after she went into labour again five days later

‘They would have tried to save them, but the chances weren’t good.

‘I prayed for them to hang on to 24 weeks, to allow them to benefit from steroids to help their lungs develop.’

Amazingly, doctors managed to prevent the birth until Axel was born at 24 weeks – the legal abortion limit.

In
 the weeks following the birth Miss Day, a former nurse, and her 
partner, Tom Perkins, 27, a telecoms project manager, were warned Axel 
might not survive.

Miss
 Day, of Barwell in Leicestershire, said: ‘When I tell people our twins 
were born five days apart, they’re always amazed. It’s not something you
 hear about every day.

‘It
 was touch and go after they were born. They were in intensive care for 
four months. Doctors warned us at one point that Axel might not survive 
24 hours.

‘They came home on my 30th birthday - which was an enormous treat – and three weeks ago we were able to take Axel’s oxygen away.

Miss Day says it was a surreal experience to see Axel in an incubator while she was still pregnant

Axel and Alfie (pictured together in an incubator) have not both learned to walk and talk but their development is expected to catch up with other children. They are pictured with their parents, Emma Day and Tom Perkins

‘They’re doing fine now, considering what they’ve been through. They’re very loving towards one another.’

Axel required further steroid treatment as well as laser eye surgery and two operations to fix hernias.

Alfie was born stronger than his brother but still required incubation and a course of antibiotics.

Alfie was able to leave hospital after three months, and Alfie was to follow a month later, so that on Miss Day’s 30th birthday she had both her boys at home with her for the first time.

Until three weeks ago, Axel required oxygen through a tube to aid his development.

He is not walking yet and Alfie has yet to say his first words, but doctors are confident they are hitting the correct developmental milestones considering their rocky start in life.

Miss Day said: ‘Last year we had one birthday for the two of them but this year we’re celebrating their birthdays on different days - they have different birthdays, whichever way you look at it.

‘Alfie is definitely the one in charge, but he’s very caring towards Axel. He’s always giving him hugs and even helps to put food into his mouth. He’s quite protective over him.’
