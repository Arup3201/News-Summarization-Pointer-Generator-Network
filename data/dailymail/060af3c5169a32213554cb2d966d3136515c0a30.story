Catherine Hoggle, 27, and two of her three children have gone missing

A Maryland mother  with paranoid schizophrenia and two of her children have gone missing.

Police said they have 'grave concerns' about the whereabouts of Catherine Hoggle, 27, and her two children, Sarah Hoggle, three, and two-year-old Jacob Hoggle.

Montgomery County police said Hoggle, from Clarksburg, is diagnosed as having paranoid schizophrenia. 

Hoggle's common-law husband, Troy Turner, contacted police on Monday night and reported that the trio were missing.

On Sunday, police say Hoggle took the children to her mother's Clarksburg house.

She said she was  going to take her son for pizza, but when she returned to her mother's home three hours later she did not have her Jacob with her. 

Hoggle claimed Jacob was at a playmate's house, but police say Jacob was not there and the youngster has not been seen since.

Police understand that at the time Turner was at his overnight job.

Sarah was last seen on Monday at her Hoggle's mother's home. 

Turner  said that on Monday Hoggle had told him the children were at daycare, but when he expressed a desire to pick them up she 'was not forthcoming.'

Police said they have 'grave concerns' about the whereabouts of Hoggle, 27 and her two children, Sarah Hoggle, three, (right) and two-year-old Jacob Hoggle (left) 

Turner told her that they should go to a police station to ask for assistance, but stopped at a restaurant where Hoggle  slipped away from him and walked to the Germantown Transit Center. 

Hoggle and Turner have another son together whose whereabouts is known.

Police described Hoggle as a white female, 5-feet-6-inches tall, 160 pounds, with brown eyes and shoulder length black hair.

She was last seen wearing blue jeans and a black tank top.

Officials said they hope that a friend is watching the children and does not know that police are hunting for them.
