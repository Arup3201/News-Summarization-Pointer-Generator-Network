Crackdown: Communities Secretary Eric Pickles, seen leaving a Cabinet meeting this week, says that the prize for cracking down on problem families is potentially huge

A single family cost the state more than £345,000 in bills for social service interventions, police and ambulance call outs in just 12 months, it has emerged.

The unnamed family, who live in Barnet in North London cost £375,718 in a year - a bill thought to be the largest ever seen by Whitehall officials.

Communities Secretary Eric Pickles published the staggering figure after the Government pledged to crackdown on 120,000 families who cost the taxpayer £9billion a year between them.

In Barnet alone 18 families cost the public purse some £1.7million in a year in benefits, prison services and policing.

Another family in the south west cost local authorities an astonishing £400,000 in two years, with just one member of that family racking up a bill of £290,000 in 12 months.

Prime Minister David Cameron has pledged to give local authorities nearly £450million to help them tackle problem families and get them to turn their lives around.

The money will be used to help family members to find work, go to school more regularly and look to reduce the costs councils incur as a result of their behaviour.

Local authorities will list problem families and enlist the help of private firms and charities to help them change their ways.

Councils will be paid £4,000 per problem family - but only if their intervention is a success.

Families who do not co-operate could either be evicted or have their benefits withdrawn.

The Department for Communities and Local Government report revealed that Solihull Council in the West Midlands used 18 per cent of its overall budget on just 3 per cent of its families before it started tackling troubled families

Greater Manchester councils have made an overall saving of £224 million from spending £138 million more effectively on 8,000 families.

In West Cheshire, the council estimates that the average family costs around £7,795 to the local authority alone, while the average troubled family costs an estimated £76,190.

Pledge: Prime Minister David Cameron has promised £450million to local authorities to help them effectively tackle troubled households

Mr Pickles said: 'The prize here is potentially huge, both in terms of reducing the financial cost on the public purse and the human costs on families and communities.

'The savings we can make for the taxpayer would far outweigh the extra money we are putting in.

'Momentum is building behind this work and we will do much more in 2013.

'We will start showing the communities around these families that things are changing for the better, with kids back in school, crime coming down and parents sorting out their problems and getting back towards work.

'And we will do all this in bigger numbers than ever before.'
