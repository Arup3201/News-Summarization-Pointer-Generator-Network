Google has launched what it describes as its most-advanced voice search to date.

The new features are available on iOS from today, having been previously available on select Android devices and the Google Chrome browser.

Google Voice Search aims to understand the context of requests, allowing follow-up questions to be asked on the same topic.

This means someone asking about the current weather in Birmingham, for example, could then ask: 'How do I get there?' - without reminding the device which city they are referring to.

The answer will be given aloud on the smartphone if it is short and succinct.

Google technology expert Michael Valvo said: 'Whether you're plotting the easiest public transport route across London, trying to order a drink in Paris en Francais, or cheating at a pub quiz, Google is there to help you get the information you need, fast.'

Its other features include giving directions based on information from live traffic updates, and setting reminders based on a location.

This could allow the user to be alerted to take the bins out when they get home, or to pick up a certain item when they get to their local supermarket, for example.

It will also allow smartphone users to ask Google to identify a song that is being played, similar to how Shazam works - and will then give the user the option of buying that song in the Google Play store.

Google claims the new voice search is faster than its nearest rival, Apple's Siri, and also provides users with more detailed answers. 

Apple's co-founder Steve Wozniak even admitted earlier this week, during an interview with the BBC, he thought the Android search was superior to Siri's.

Mr Valvo added: 'This is Google's most advanced voice search ever, which is now available to the majority of smartphone users in the UK with the release day of the latest Google search app on iOS.

'It has the ability to understand the context of a conversation and spoken directions that even take into account traffic conditions.'

The voice search technology builds on the changes Google made to written searches, announced in September.

When you search Google it no longer just searches for individual keywords; it can now respond to questions and statements in the same way a human might, by looking at the whole query - even if it doesn't have an exact answer.

For example, asking Google 'Tell me about impressionist artists' will show a list of artists but also now let you click to learn about the impressionist movement, browse individual artwork, or switch to abstract artists using filters.

Called Hummingbird, the company claimed it was 'the most significant algorithm change' in years. It affects 90 per cent of searches and the firm began rolling it out to select users in August.

Google also unveiled a new Google+ feature called Auto Awesome which combines videos and photos shared on the social network and automatically turns it into a video.

Auto Awesome movies is currently only available for select Android devices running JellyBean 4.3 including the Nexus 4, Nexus 7, Nexus 10, HTC One and Samsung's Galaxy S4.

Google said it hopes to make the feature 'more broadly available in the future.'
