Twitter has been valued at up to £10billion just seven years after it  was launched.

The micro-blogging site, which has amassed 200million users, is to be floated on the stock market in what was last night described by a leading broker as ‘the most hotly anticipated stock offering since Facebook’.

Appropriately, the US firm broke the news in a 135-character tweet, explaining it had submitted its flotation application this week to the Wall Street watchdog the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The website has become a cultural touchstone used by celebrities and politicians to keep in touch with the public.

It was launched in 2006 by programmer Jack Dorsey and web entrepreneur Evan Williams in California.

The
pair were joined by designer Biz Stone who gave the site its 
distinctive look.

All three are in line for multi-million-pound payouts 
if the float, which is expected late this year or early in 2014, 
succeeds.

This is the first ever tweet sent by creator and co-founder Jack Dorsey on March 21, 2006

The move is one of the most highly anticipated IPOs in tech history with Twitter the last of the major social networking sites to go public.

Evan Williams

Age: 41

Net worth: $1 - $2billion

Potential worth: $8billion

CNN Money estimated that he has a 30 to 35 per cent share in the company. His firms have also founded Blogger and Medium.

Williams, a vegetarian, lives in the San Francisco Bay area with his wife Sara Morishige and the pair have two children.

Role: Co-founder and former Chief Executive of Twitter

Jack Dorsey

Age: 36

Net worth: $1.1billion

Potential worth: $3.1billion

Mr Dorsey sent the first ever tweet in March 2006 and is thought to own a 10 per cent share in the company.

Although he made his name with Twitter, most of his current fortune is thought to have been amassed through his estimated 25 per cent stake in mobile payment start up Square.

He is a certified masseur and lives in San Francisco.

Role: Executive chairman at Twitter, CEO at Square

Biz Stone

Age: 39

Net worth: Thought to be around $200million

Potential worth: Around $2billion

As well as Twitter, Stone, full name Christopher Isaac, helped to create and launch Xanga, Blogger, Odeo and Medium.

He is also CEO of a 2012 start-up called Jelly Industries, thought to be a mobile app.

He has written two books on blogging and made his directorial debut as part of Project Imaginat10n with Ron Howard.

It comes after Facebook floated on the US stock market in May 2012 for $104 billion (£66.2 billion) and, despite seeing an initial slump in shares, has since had a resurgence.

It is thought that like Facebook, Twitter bosses' hands were forced by the Jobs Act which requires a U.S firm to file an IPO once it has reached 2,000 investors.

Although the IPO was filed confidentially - the law allows companies with less than $1billion revenue in its last financial year to do so - the company was quick to announce its intentions, naturally, with a tweet last night.

The confidentiality should help Twitter avoid the media scrutiny that surrounded Facebook's decision to float.

The company has been ramping up its advertising products and working to boost ad revenue in preparation.

But it is still small in comparison to Facebook, which saw its highly anticipated IPO implode last year amid worries about its ability to grow mobile ad revenue.

Under the law, Twitter's financial statements and other sensitive information contained in the IPO filing must become publicly available at least 21 days before company's executives begin traveling around the country to meet with potential investors - a process known as a 'road show'.

The decision to float the company is likely to see the company's founders Jack Dorsey, Evan Williams and Biz Stone stand to gain huge financial windfalls.

The site was founded in March 2006 but has become one of the world's most popular social networking sites over the past seven years.

Dorsey introduced the world to the site by sending out the first ever tweet which read: 'Just setting up my twttr'.

The 36-year-old is also the founder and CEO 
of Square, a mobile payments company. He is reportedly living in a $10 
million home in San Francisco and dating his longtime girlfriend, Kate 
Greer.

Dorsey's interest in programming 
began at the ripe age of eight, according to a 2011 Vanity Fair article. He 
came up with the idea for Twitter in his 20s and shared it with Biz 
Stone and Evan Williams, two of his bosses at San Francisco software 
startup Odeo.

Williams embraced the idea and made Dorsey, who was 29 at the time, the founding CEO of the new company.

Stone, 39, and Williams, 41, have also helped create Blogger, Medium, and a host of other Internet ventures.

Dorsey is currently thought to be worth around $1.1billion but the floatation could see that figure increase threefold.

Biz Stone's wealth could jump from $200million to $2billion, while Evan Williams, thought to be the richest of the three, could see his personal fortune jump from $2billion to $8billion.

Others
that stand to gain from Twitter going public include early investors 
Union Square Ventures, Charles River Ventures and Spark Capital, as well
as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Netscape co-founder Marc Andreessen, Ron 
Conway and Naval Ravikant.

The
company delivered the news of its planned IPO Thursday in a tweet sent out at 5 p.m. The tweet read, 
'We've confidentially submitted an S-1 to the SEC for a planned IPO. 
This Tweet does not constitute an offer of any securities for sale.'

That tweet was followed up by a second post: 'Now, back to work.'

Bloomberg reports that Goldman Sachs is expected to be the lead underwriter of the offering.

Twitter had been working to boost ad revenue in 
preparation for the move.

It  recently acquired MoPub, a mobile advertising company that has a $100 
million annual revenue run rate, and in July, the company hired a number
of people with IPO experience.

Big business: Twitter is following in the footsteps of other major social networking websites that have gone public, such as Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook which now has a share value of some $108billion

EMarketer
estimated in March that Twitter's revenue will be $582 million this 
year and close to $1 billion in 2014.

Twitter will be hoping to fare better than when Facebook floated last year, a move which was initially a flop.

Facebook
priced its IPO in May 2012 at $38 per share, but the stock fell almost 
immediately, trading well below its launch price.

The stock continued to
fall over the next couple months, trading at $22 per share by September
2012.

A year later, 
however, share prices have made a full recovery.

By the time the markets
closed Thursday, Facebook's stock was priced at $44 per share.

Twitter’s CEO is Dick Costolo, the company’s former Chief Operating Officer - a position now held by Rowghani Ali.

Twitter was created back in March 2006 but its popularity soon went through the roof with more than 500 million users registered worldwide as of last year and more than 500 million tweets sent a day. Here is a list of interesting facts about what makes Twitter a global phenomenon:
