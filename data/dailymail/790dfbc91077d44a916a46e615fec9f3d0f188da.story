The 5:2 diet, or Intermittent Fasting (IF) has quickly become the diet-de-jour for those looking to shed pounds after being hailed as a wonder diet by a doctor on BBC2's Horizon.

The diet, which advocates eating just 500 calories (600 for men) on two non-consecutive days each week, then normally for the other five, promises weight loss as well as a host of other health benefits.

Now followed by celebrities like Miranda Kerr it has become the most popular new diet of the year and so Pizza Express has embraced the idea and launched new dishes that fit in with the lo-cal eating plan.

The new Superfood salad contains mozzarella, avocado, pine kernels, cucumber, lentils and fresh basil and contains less than 300 calories

The mini Oddono Raspberry sorbet is a non dairy sweet treat that comes to under 100 calories, and is served in a sweet tea cup

The restaurant chain has extended its existing light ‘Leggera’ range so that those following the diet can still eat at the restaurant on their two ‘starvation’ days.

In addition to the Leggera pizzas, which were launched in 2009 and each fall under 500 calories, they have added a Superfood  Salad and a Mini Oddono’s Raspberry Sorbet.

The Superfood Salad is made up of baby spinach and seasonal mixed leaves, roasted butternutsquash, beetroot, light baby mozzarella, avocado, pine kernels, cucumber, lentils and fresh basil finished with balsamic syrup and contains less than 300 calories.

The Mini Oddono Raspberry sorbet is a non dairy sweet treat that comes to under 100 calories, and the range even contains a low calorie wine which is just 100 calories.

The Leggera Pizzas, which have salad in the centre and contain under 500 calories, have been a huge success for the restaurant chain

These low cal options are designed to make eating out when watching your weight easier and Pizza Express have even involved a nutritionist in their meal development.

However while the nutritionist provides a sample day meal plan for those on the starvation day she does stress that she does not advocate the diet, saying instead she would recommend a more continuous reduction of calories .

Pizza Express say in their email to customers: ‘We know a number of our customers our trying to lose weight at the moment by doing the 5:2 diet plan so we asked our nutritionist, Juliette Kellow, for advice on how you could manage a fasting day if you are out and about.

‘But please remember, this level of calories is not recommended by her or other nutritionists as being suitable for a daily regime, outside of the 5:2 programme. For sensible and healthy weight loss, Juliette would advise having around 1,500 calories a day to help you lose 1lb a week.'
