J Edgar Hoover refused permission for Bond producers to even mention his agency by name after he was passed a memo on Goldfinger

Nowadays James Bond is a household name that everyone, from designer brands to luxury car makers, wants to be associated with.

But back in 1964 - just two years after the Cuban Missile Crisis - the FBI reacted with horror after learning of plans to feature the Bureau in upcoming Bond flick Goldfinger.

J Edgar Hoover refused filmakers permission to even mention his agency by name after being passed a memo explaining that Bond was a British spy who had 'beautiful women presenting themselves to him in scanty attire'.

Newly released FBI files show that the movie was brought to the attention of the Bureau after producer Harry Saltzman requested the use of military aircraft during filming.

The request prompted the FBI, which was still on high alert after years of Cold War tensions, to run background checks on Saltzman, author Ian Fleming, and screenplay writer Richard Maibaum.

While the reports seem to have got some information spot on - referring to Fleming's novels as being filled with 'sex and bizarre situations' - in other places the intelligence was sadly lacking.

For example, the character of Felix Leiter is described as 'a fictional FBI agent', while any true Bond fan will know he in fact works for the CIA.

The reports, which were revealed by the Guardian, also wrongly name actor Jack Lord as the man playing Leiter, when in fact he was replaced by Cec Linder in Goldfinger.

And, in a spectacular rewrite of the ending, the report claims that Goldfinger's attempted robbery of Fort Knox is solved by the FBI themselves, when in fact James Bond foils the dastardly plot.

The FBI were clearly not impressed with what they found, writing that Fleming's book was 'not the type where we would want any mention of the FBI or a portrayal of FBI agents, no matter how favorable they might look in the movie.

'Fleming's stories generally center around sex and bizarre situations and, certainly, are not the type with which we want to be associated.'

After reading the reports, Hoover responded that agents speaking to Saltzman should 'forcibly bring to his attention' a law 'which prohibits the use of the words "Federal Bureau of Investigation" or any of its written initials without my written permission.'

The documents also contain wrong information about previous Bond films, including From Russia With Love which is repeatedly referred to as 'For Russian With Love', and is said to contain 'sex and excessive nudity.'

The memos also reveal that 1964 was not the first time Ian Fleming's books had been brought to the attention of intelligence agents, after the author mentioned the FBI on several occasions.

The FBI ran checks on Bond, saying the novels involved 'beautiful women presenting themselves to him in scanty attire'. But they also got the ending of the film wrong, claiming the FBI foils Goldfinger's plot

The memo reads: 'All of these references have been favourable in the past. His stories are generally filled with beautiful women presenting themselves to him in scanty attire.

'It was reported in Life magazine in August 1962 that President Kennedy was one of his most avid readers.'

But despite the favourable references and presidential endorsement, Hoover ordered his agents to contact Saltzman and 'vigorously protest any mention of FBI or portrayal of its agents in his proposed movie.'

Behind-the-scenes details about the production are also unearthed in the secret files, including the fact that film company United Artists paid $300,000 fro the script, and planned to spend $3million making it.
