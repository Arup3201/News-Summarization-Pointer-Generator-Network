Second Lieutenant Walter Tull was the first black British Army officer

A new play about Britain's first black Army officer hopes to strengthen a campaign to award him a Military Cross.

Second Lieutenant Walter Tull, who grew up in an East London orphanage, was recommended for a Military Cross for heroism on the Western Front, according to letters sent to his family after he was killed in 1918.

He was commended for his 'gallantry and coolness under fire' during bloody battles in the trenches of Europe.'

But the soldier never received the award, fuelling speculation he had been overlooked because of rules prohibiting officers of 'non-European descent' leading white troops.

Now a play about his life is about to take to the stage this month and its writer hopes it will add fuel to the campaign to award Tull - who also played for Tottenham Hotspur - a posthumous Military Cross.

Tull has been written by Phil Vasili who told The Independent on Sunday: 'Walter was made an officer during a time when it was practically expedient for the Army.

'The rules were broken because it suited the Army so to do.

'However, the rejection of his Military Cross recommendation was, I feel, because he embodied a legal contradiction as an officer of non-European descent.'

The campaign has been backed by Michael Morpurgo, author of War Horse, whose recent book A Medal for Leroy, draws heavily on Tull's life story.

Speaking last year he said: 'We don't know why this medal was not awarded. There shouldn't have been any black officers in the British Army.

'I think the medal commendation somehow got misplaced. We just don't know. But now is the right moment to be putting this right.'

Second Lt Tull was born in Folkstone, Kent, in April 1888, the son of a carpenter from Barbados who moved to England and married a local woman.

By the age of 10 his parents had died and documents on the website Findmypast.co.uk show that he was living at an orphanage in Bethnal Green, East London.Â

Walter Tull was born in Folkstone in 1888, the son of a carpenter whose own father had been a slave.

His mother, from Kent, died when he was seven and his father two years later. He and his brother were sent to an orphanage in East London.

Tull's football career began in 1908 for Clapton FC. He went on to play for Tottenham Hotspur and Northampton.

In 1914 he volunteered for the army and was promoted three times while training.

Having been sent to France in November 1914, he returned home in May 1915 with 'acute mania' but later took part in the 1916 Battle of the Somme.

On May 30, 1917 he received his officer's commission. He was sent to Italy where he was mentioned in despatches.

He returned to the Western Front where, on March 25, 1918, he was killed by machine gun fire. His body was never found.

He played professional football for Tottenham Hotspur - making him the first black outfield player in England's top division.

On
the outbreak of war in 1914, he volunteered for the Football Battalion,
part of the 17th Middlesex Regiment, and fought in many fierce 
operations, including the Battle of the Somme in 1916.

He
was commissioned as an officer in May 1917 and sent to Italy where he 
led his men and was mentioned in dispatches for bravery at the Battle of
Piave.

Second Lt Tull was transferred to 
France to take part in a push to break through the German lines at 
Favreuil, in the Somme Valley. In March 1918, aged 29, he was killed.

His
men tried to retrieve his body from No Man's Land but they were beaten 
back by heavy enemy machine gun fire. His body was never found.

The MoD said no record of the Military Cross recommendation was found in 2nd Lt Tull's service files at the National Archives

Tull will preview at Bolton's Octogan this Thursday.
