Queens Park Rangers boss Harry Redknapp is ready to offer Andros Townsend an escape route out of White Hart Lane, where he has fallen out of favour this season.

Redknapp has prioritised a winger and a centre-forward in the transfer window and thinks 23-year-old Townsend can help Rangers beat the drop.

Townsend produced the best form of his career while on loan at Loftus Road under Redknapp two seasons ago.

The winger has endured a nightmare 2014, with ankle surgery ruling him out of the world Cup having played an instrumental role in helping England qualify.

He then found himself out of favour under Mauricio Pochettino and has been started in just one Premier League match this season.

Townsend has featured more prominently in the UEFA Europa League, starting seven matches and helping Spurs negotiate the group phase.

His loan spell at QPR under Redknapp in the 2012-2013 season saw him score two goals in 12 Premier League games.
