Sylvia Day's Crossfire trilogy sells 1m copies in three months

Only J.K Rowling and Dan Brown have had better first week sales

It is graphic, more sexually explicit and has a handsome but dysfunctional male lead women are already swooning over.

Readers looking for their next fix after 50 Shades of Grey are now reaching for Sylvia Day’s Crossfire trilogy.

The books do not feature bondage or sadomasochism but the sex scenes are more frequent and graphic.

American Author of the Crossfire series Sylvia Day is set for success with a million book sales in three months

Book one, entitled Bared to You, and book two, called Reflected in You, have sold more than one million copies, both print and e-editions, in the past three months.

Print sales for Reflected in You topped in 82,000 in the first six days of release – only two other novels have had better opening week sales - JK Rowling's The Casual Vacancy, and Dan Brown's The Lost Symbol.

Publisher Penguin said it would not give e-book figures for commercial reasons but that total sales for the two books combined was now in excess of one million.

Fans admitted there are many similarities with EL James 50 Shades of Grey books but have hailed Day’s work as “better written”, “more exciting”, and “addictive” with hundreds giving rave reviews online.

The story follows 24-year-old Eva Trammell who works in an advertising firm and her intense and passionate relationship with 28-year-old sexually magnetic billionaire.

One fan wrote: ‘5 Highly Satisfied Stars. Sexy, sophisticated, intense and impossible to put down! In Bared To You, Sylvia Day has crafted a rousing tale of emotional and sexual obsession you will not want to miss, without a doubt!

‘The writing is superb, contemporary and truly gives all comparable books and series a run for their money! In my opinion, this easily comes out on top.

Another said: ‘Move over Christian Grey, 'cause I'm totally smitten with Gideon Cross.

This story was amazing. Brilliant. Engaging. Sexy. Edgy. Angsty. All things I love, all wrapped up in one dysfunctionally appealing package.’

In a recent interview with Socialite Life, Miss Day dismissed concerns her work was simply a replica of EL James’ work.

She said: ‘The 50 Shades series is a Cinderella story, where the characters seemingly have no flaws.

The Crossfire series is very different in that these two characters are almost mirror images of each other. Eva and Gideon are both wealthy and have had that advantage. As they get to know each other they realize they have the same traumas in their past, which is both are sexual child abuse survivors.

‘So there’s a lot of baggage that comes into the relationship and they both cope with those traumas in totally different ways. The things she uses to thrive trigger him in negative ways and vice versa.

The books have yet to rival the sales figures for the 50 Shades of Grey trilogy.

The first erotic novel in the series has sold excess of 5.3 million copies with print and digital combined in the UK, making it the bestselling British book in the past decade.

The second and third books in the trilogy, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed, have sold around 3.6 million and 3.2 million copies respectively.

Publishers have hailed this the “year of the bonkbuster” as mummy porn takes over from chick-lit as the new must-read genre for women.

Earlier this year, Shirley Conran’s classic Lace was re-released and Mills & Boon launched  new eBook erotica series under the banner Twelve Shades of Surrender.

The £1.99 erotic short stories range features titles such as Going Down, about a young girl finding sexual freedom in Paris, Cuffing Kate, which lays bare fantasises about dominance and submission, and For Your Pleasure, about naughty neighbours.

The company, famed for its romantic stories began publishing more hardcore erotica in 2008, with the Spice paperback series.

The collection of novels are said to be even more erotic than Fifty Shades of Grey

But the boom in digital e-readers such as the Amazon’s Kindle, Sony’s Reader, and devices such as the iPad, means such content is more accessible anonymously, prompting them to release a new series.

The revival of Shirley Conran’s Lace, three decades after it was first published and 15 years after it went out of print, is also a nod to the demand from women for books with sexual content designed for them.

It was a huge hit in the 1980s despite the controversy surrounding its explicit content and was made into a mini-series for TV.
