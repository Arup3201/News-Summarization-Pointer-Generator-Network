Argentina advanced to the quarter-finals of the Davis Cup on Monday, beating Brazil 3-2 after Federico Delbonis defeated Thomaz Bellucci 6-3, 3-6, 6-2, 7-5 in a match that took two days to complete.

The match had been suspended because of darkness on Sunday with Delbonis leading 1-0.

It started late after Leonardo Mayer needed six hours, 42 minutes to beat Joao Souza in the longest singles match ever played in the Davis Cup.
