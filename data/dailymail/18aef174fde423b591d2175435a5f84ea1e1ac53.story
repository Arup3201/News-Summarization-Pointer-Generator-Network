A terrified teenager decided to risk breaking a leg by jumping 35ft from a chairlift because because she feared she was about to be struck by lightning.

Melanie Rossomando of Springfield said she 'freaked out' when her chairlift ride high above the beach in New Jersey stopped as a thunderstorm approached â€” and that's why she took the decision to leap to the sand below.

The 17-year-old told CBS New York she took the extreme option when her chairlift came to a halt as she took a final ride of the day with her friend Herlide Joseph after celebrating her birthday at the Casino Pier amusement park.

Going: One of Rossomando's shoes is seen falling to the ground after the 17-year-old kicked it off moments before her jump

Gone: Without hesitation Rossomando, of Springfield eases herself out of the chairlift and hurtles 35ft to the sand below

The leap was captured on a shaky mobile phone by a pedestrian and the footage has already had more than 20,000 views on YouTube.

The video shows the girl kicking off her shoes and jumping off the Sky Ride lift as dark clouds and heavy winds roll in. It doesn't, however, show her landing on the beach.

Rossomando said: 'In my mind I was like, I'm either getting struck by lightning or I'm breaking a leg maybe.

'The way my hair was blowing, the way that the seat was rocking, the lightning so close.'

Her friend Herlide Joseph who was alongside her on the chairlift said she told Rossomando: 'I'll only jump if you jump with me and she said 'okay' and right away she jumped and I wasn't ready for it.'

Lucky: The teenager suffered only bruises to her foot, arm and neck and says it was fortunate an off-duty medic was able to assist

Fortunately the daredevil wasn't injured in the leap and on the video a man is heard screaming 'don't jump, don't jump,' to those people still on the chairlifts.

Rossomando says an off duty Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) came to her assistance. She said: 'Thank God for him, because if it wasn't for him I don't know what I would have done.'

'I'm not a calm person, I'm really not. I freaked out. You can hear in the video I was screaming bloody murder.'

In the end she only suffered a sore arm, foot and neck. Her friend stayed on the lift until it was able to take her safely back to the entrance.

Her father Peter said: 'That was her instinct with lightning all around her so we support that she did it, we are just glad she is okay.'

The operators of the Casino Pier said the chair ride was in standby mode and no new passengers were being allowed on when the power went out.

They said staff, following emergency procedures, evacuated the remaining riders and that they didn't know a passenger had jumped off until they saw the video Sunday.

The chairlift takes riders above the beach and boardwalk, offering cool ocean breezes and views of MTV's 'Jersey Shore' house, among other things.
