Two men have been arrested by police investigating a spate of tragic deaths among young partygoers believed to have taken contaminated ‘Dr Death’ ecstasy tablets.

Five people have died in the last month – three last weekend - just hours after they apparently took the drug.

Greater Manchester Police are questioning two men, aged 33 and 34, on suspicion of being concerned in supplying a controlled drug.

It comes after the uncle of the first victim - Charlotte Woodiwiss - yesterday warned other young people not to risk their lives taking the recreational drug.

Drug death: Charlotte Woodiwiss died in Derbyshire last month after apparently taking a contaminated drug

thought they both took contaminated ecstasy tablets

He made the comments after the funeral of Ms Woodiwiss - who was found dead at a flat in Chapel-en-le-Frith in Derbyshire on 
December 22 after apparently taking the ecstasy pill - was held earlier this week.

In a heartbreaking Facebook message, 
40-year-old Matt Woodiwiss wrote: ‘I’m Charlotte’s uncle and am absolutely
 devastated by my family’s loss. Our beautiful girl gone far too early. I
 am heartened by the fact that so many of you have commented but let 
this tragic sequence of events teach you a few things.

‘Think
 long and hard about how you live your lives, about which group of 
people you hang about with and about who influences you.

'It’s
 all very well writing a few “nice” things on a FB wall but if you carry
 on living your lives as so many of you are then – as much as it seems 
like a laugh at the moment – you are running the risk of your families 
being torn apart with grief like mine is.

‘So,
 by all means quote the poems and write the testimonials, but don’t let 
our little girl’s tragic death be in vain. Some of you have the chance 
to be shining stars whilst still here, and believe me that is far better
 than being one in death.

‘So remember Charlotte with 
happiness, remember her vitality, carry on loving her as some of you 
did, and most of all learn from this as that is the best testament that 
you can give to my beautiful niece.’

It comes as police warned that a 
contaminated batch of ecstasy tablets could be circulating following the
 deaths of the two 'apparently fit young men' from the same town.

Gareth Ashton, 28, died at Wigan Infirmary on Monday while Jordan Chambers, 19, died at Oldham Hospital on Sunday.

Charlotte Woodiwiss, 20, from Chapel-le-Frith 
and Dale Yates, 18, from Buxton, both died in December from apparently 
taking contaminated ecstasy pills but Greater Manchester Police are not 
connecting their deaths to the two men who died in Wigan

The pair, both from Wigan, were 
admitted to hospital after complaining of feeling unwell and suffered 
the same symptoms. Both said they had taken drugs.

Greater
 Manchester Police are investigating where the men had been socialising 
and if they were out together when they took the pills.

Superintendent Andrea Jones said several others went to hospital yesterday suffering similar symptoms but all have been released.

A third man, a 26-year-old, died in 
Liverpool on Sunday and is believed to have taken tablets - possibly 
ecstasy - before he collapsed.

Greater Manchester Police are not 
currently linking his death to the two in their region, but said they 
could not discount a connection.

It comes after the deaths of Ms Woodiwiss
 and another partygoer in Derbyshire - Dale Yates, 18, 
who was discovered at a flat in Buxton on December 23.

It is believed they took Dr Death, 
often shaped like Love Hearts sweets and also called Pink Ecstasy, which has 
the chemical name PMMA.

It
 is sold to clubbers for as little as £3 a pill and dealers claim it 
offers a similar high to ecstasy (MDMA) but it is around five times as 
strong and causes a dangerous rise in body temperature.

The father of Dale Yates has also warned that young people are playing Russian roulette with their lives by taking the drug.

Lawrence Beever, 40, said: ‘So many kids take these recreational drugs but they just don’t know what’s in them.

'They go out to parties, they see their friends taking them, so they have some too, and they don’t realise they’re playing Russian roulette. These pills are deadly.'

Derbyshire Police said at the time there
 was nothing to link those deaths but issued a warning about drug misuse
 as they pointed out illegal drugs and so-called legal highs can have 
different strengths and components.

Five people were arrested on suspicion 
of drug offences following the death of Mr Yates, while six people were 
detained over the death of Miss Woodiwiss in Derbyshire.

All the suspects were later bailed pending further inquiries.

Superintendent Jones today further warned 
about the dangers of drug use and said the contaminated pills are 
thought to be brightly coloured heart-shaped ecstasy tablets which come 
in purple, green, red or yellow.

Friends paid tribute to Jordan Chambers, pictured, saying he was 'such a nice lad' who will be 'truly missed'

Ms Jones urged anyone with information on such pills to come forward to help them with their inquiries.

She said: 'These illegal drugs nobody knows what poisons they contain, what toxic chemicals they contain.'

Toxicology tests are due to take place to establish how Mr Ashton and Mr Chambers died.

The girlfriend of Mr Ashton, Catherine Fulton, 29, has also urged people to think twice before taking drugs.

She said: ‘This has come as a massive shock not least because he wasn’t a drug abuser. I’d tell other people just not to do drugs.

'It ruins the people who are left behind and we have to pick up the pieces. I want this to make people think twice and I hope this opens their eyes to other people’s grief.'

Det Con Ms Jones said Wigan is not thought to have
 a particular drug problem and that Greater Manchester Police are 
liaising with other forces.

Detective
 Chief Inspector Howard Millington, from Wigan CID, added that he was 
concerned there could be further deaths if the drugs continue to 
circulate in the area and urged anyone feeling unwell after taking 
ecstasy pills to go to hospital for a check-up.

'We are very concerned at how these deaths of two apparently fit young men have occurred,' he added.
