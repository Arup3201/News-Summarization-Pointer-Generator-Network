A gang kicked a Sikh lawyer’s turban off his head in a ‘ferocious’ attack outside St Paul’s Cathedral, a court heard.

Rashvinder Panesar and his wife Sundeep were on their way home from a meeting of the Society of Asian Lawyers in the City of London when they were set upon.

Luxmanan Mahendran, 28, and two other men allegedly shouted ‘let’s kick his turban off’ and ‘kick it away’ as they kicked and punched Mr Panesar in April last year.

When Mrs Panesar, also a lawyer, tried to intervene and retrieve her husband’s dislodged turban, she too was grabbed and almost knocked to the ground by Mahendran, the Old Bailey heard.

Mr Panesar told the jury that he was kicked to the ground by the three men.

‘My turban came loose and there was a comment made to kick it,’ Mr Panesar said.

‘It came off my head and it was directly kicked.’

He said Mahendran had shouted a sexual comment to his wife - ‘tuck me in baby’.

When Mr Panesar confronted him the men became aggressive and threatened to ‘put him to sleep’, the court heard.

‘One of the guys pushed me in the chest,’ he said.

‘All three of them stepped forward.

‘I was kicked to the floor and then when I was on the floor repeatedly kicked in the face, legs, head, my back and the back of my head.

‘This defendant was the most aggressive one, he was the one who instigated the situation and he was the one who pushed me.’

He added: ‘In the ambulance my wife was visibly shaking and traumatised. 

‘I didn’t want to be seen without my turban, I find it embarrassing so I tied it back on in the ambulance.’

The alleged attack took place in Carter Lane, at around 10.45pm on 26 April 2013.

Mr Panesar suffered a fractured nose, a chipped tooth, injured his knee and had one of his contact lens knocked out.

He was taken to University College Hospital for treatment and said he still suffers pain from ligament damage to his shoulder.

Prosecutor Samantha Cohen said: ‘Mr Panesar on 26 April last year had been attending one of those work-related social occasions.

‘He had been on the organising committee of the organisation running the event.

‘It was at a bar not too far from this court.

‘They left the venue at about 10.30pm heading home because they had to relieve the babysitter.

‘They walked together past St Paul’s trying to get a taxi.

‘The couple came across a group of three men, all Asian, this defendant was one of those men.

‘One of the group made a sexualised comment towards Mrs Panesar.

‘Mr Panesar asked him what he was doing.

‘The three males together then became really quite aggressive swearing at Mr Panesar and his wife.

‘They threatened to ‘tuck him in’ or ‘put him to sleep’.

The trial is taking place at the Old Bailey in London, close to where the allleged attack took place, jurors were told

‘They approached him, pushed him, he was punched and fell to the ground.

‘While on the ground he was punched and kicked by all three of the assailants.

‘He tried to defend himself by punching back but it didn’t have any effect..

‘The assault was so ferocious that his left contact lens popped out of his eye following one of the kicks to his head.

‘During the course of the assault the turban on his head was kicked off.

‘He suffered swelling and bruising, mainly to his head and face.’

The alleged attack was partly caught on CCTV and two eye witnesses described seeing the victim on the ground being kicked by three men, the court heard.

Mahendran was arrested at the scene and told police that Mr Panesar attacked him and his friends as they got out of a taxi.

Mahendran, of north London, denies a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

The trial continues.
