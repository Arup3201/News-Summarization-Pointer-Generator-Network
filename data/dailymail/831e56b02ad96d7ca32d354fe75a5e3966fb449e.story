An American comedian's rage about Rupert Murdoch blaming all Muslims for terrorism has evolved into a hilarious hashtag which has taken off on Twitter.

Aziz Ansari's plan of a quiet night in to watch the Golden Globes on Monday night was ruined when he discovered the tweets from the Australian media tycoon holding every Muslim across the globe responsible for terrorist attacks until they destroy their 'jihadist cancer'.

To express his outrage Ansari started #RupertsFault which has taken on a life of its own with the News Corp boss being blamed for everything from The Kardashians, the popularity of The Big Bang Theory, Kirk Cameron movies and even Hitler.

Ansari's reaction stems from the media tycoon's tweet saying all Muslims were responsible for terrorism

Born in South Carolina to a Tamil Muslim family originally from India, Ansari asked Murdoch for tips on how Muslims should eliminate all terror throughout the world.

'Rups can we get a step by step guide? How can my 60 year old parents in NC help destroy terrorist groups? Plz advise,' he tweeted.

Ansari continued to vent  asking Murdoch what he had done to stop crimes by people of his religion.

'@rupertmurdoch is responsible for all pedophilia committed by anyone Catholic. why are you pro-pedophile :(' another post said.

He then went on to clarify that he was not targeting any religious groups

'To be clear, I am not religious and have nothing against Christians or Muslims, just ignorance like what @rupertmurdoch is spreading.'

Ansari also asked the billionaire for a step by step guide on how to destroy terrorist groups

The hashtag then took on a hilarious life of its own with the business magnate being blamed for all sorts

Ansari then decided to throw some humour in the mix by blaming the business magnate for 'anytime a Christian person rear ended your car.'

But it wasn't until other punters jumped on the hashtag wagon that things started to get quite hilarious. 

The billionaire was held responsible for everything from 'uber surge pricing', Westboro Baptist Church and Hotel California.

Not being able to access alcoholic beverage also made the list. 

'I can't buy whiskey on Sunday. #RupertsFault,' Maxwell K posted.

The media tycoon asked all Muslims to destroy 'their growing jihadist cancer'

As did the yanks trying to impersonate fair dinkum Aussies.

'Anytime an American drunkenly says "Shrimp on the Barbie." #RupertsFault,' Justin Bob Tierney quipped.

Dodgy fast food even got a mention. 

'panda express "chinese food" #RupertsFault, another user added.

The News Corp boss was also blamed for the cost of acquiring an education. 

'College text books are too expensive #RupertsFault,' Andre Wright posted.

Ansari is not the only well-known personalities who has weighed in on the Rupert Twitter debate.

'I was born Christian. If that makes Rupert Murdoch my responsibility, I'll auto-excommunicate,' Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling posted. 

Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling and comedian Adam Hills also weighed in on the Murdoch Twitter outrage

While Australian comedian Adam Hills suggested it was Murdoch who needed to be erdaicated calling him an 'outdated, bigoted, sociopath'.

'Maybe all Australians lovely but until we recognise and destroy the growing pus sore that is we must be held accountable,' his post says.

Fellow Australian comedian Dan Illic also had his say.

'Perhaps we could hold all Australians responsible for @rupertmurdoch?'

Meanwhile, white men took it upon themselves to apologise on behalf of Murdoch's comments.

BBC producer Michael MacLennan described Murdoch as a 'terrible person'.

'Let's hope us white people aren't considered collectively responsible for him. If so I apologise,' he said.

British author Matt Haig and ABC radio producer Mattthew Bevan also apologised for Murdoch's behaviour .
