The family of a 68-year-old woman who died when her house collapsed in a landslide are complaining that her home has been left open and unprotected for thieves to ransack.

Grandmother Susan Norman was killed in March when torrential downpours swept away her three-storey hillside house in Looe, Cornwall.

Mrs Norman, who lived alone, had already complained to authorities that she feared her home might fall down following a nearby landslip in December.

Landslide: Susan Norman had already told Devon and Cornwall authorities several months before she was killed that she was worried about what might happen to her house in a storm

To add insult to injury, her son Matthew Boden, 44, believes thieves have been climbing into her partially-collapsed property which is surrounded by just a metal fence.

He is angry that local authorities haven’t done more to secure the site.

Mr Boden said: 'We think people may have been in and taken things.

'All the tourists stop outside to have a good look. We just want it to be cleared so we can begin to move on.

'My mum would be absolutely horrified if she knew her belongings were on display for everyone to see.'

Family and friends have been banned from the wrecked home because of an ongoing probe by police and the Health and Safety Executive.

Mr Boden added: 'My younger sister has been affected the most. She keeps going down to the house to look at all of her things.

'She can see the urn which has the ashes of my mum’s cat inside. She wants to go in to get it but I tell 
her she can’t because it’s not safe.

'Everything else is completely buried. We can’t move on until the house is cleared.

'It just doesn’t seem that anyone has any sense of urgency at all.'

A spokesman for Devon and Cornwall Police said the site should be cleared by next month.
