Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli has left Italy's training camp with a hamstring injury.

The 24-year-old suffered the problem in training ahead of Sunday's European Championship qualifier with Croatia and has been unable to recover from it.

It was decided on Saturday that Balotelli would be released back to his club and Italy announced the news on their official Twitter feed.

The Italy national side confirm on their official Twitter feed that Mario Balotelli has left the squad owing to injury

Balotelli has yet to find the net for Liverpool in the Premier League this season

It will come as a big blow to the maverick Italian forward, who has had a season to forget so far, struggling to make any kind of impact for his new side since a £16million move from AC Milan.

Balotelli would have been relishing the opportunity to impress new coach Antonio Conte against Croatia - especially after he left him out of his last squad.

Juventus defender Angelo Ogbonna has also gone home with a similar complaint.

Italy also play Albania in a friendly on Tuesday and  Conte has called up 14 extra players for the match.

Those who face Croatia will not be involved, giving some fringe names the chance to impress.

Sampdoria striker Stefano Okaka, Cagliari defender Luca Rossettini and Genoa midfielder Stefano Sturaro all receive their first call-ups.
