Kristy Gaffney could not believe her luck when she met a man who was well-connected, wealthy and intelligent on an online dating site.

Just months later, the 29-year-old from Plymouth Meeting, Philadelphia and the man - who told her he was called Ed, part of the DuPont family, divorced and worked for the C.I.A - began discussing marriage.

But the chance meeting has left her life in tatters, after he tricked her into signing paperwork to give her baby to him... and his wife.

Duped: Kristy Gaffney, 29, met a man online with whom she had a child. He tricked her into signing papers that allowed him to adopt their child

'I thought he was Mr. Perfect,'Gaffney told NBC10. 'There’s no words for it. I’m just so angry at him.'

Gaffney told the news channel she was at first reluctant to take the relationship seriously, but eventually agreed to meet him in a public place.

But the dinner at a restaurant led to many more dates, in which Gaffney discovered Ed's 'connections'.

She told NBC10: 'He said, "My last name is Dupont". And I said, "related to the Duponts?" And he said, "Yes".'

'Liars': Emmitt Dippold, right, told Gaffney his name was Ed Dupont and that he was divorced. In fact, he was still married and he and his wife wanted her child

The couple began talking about marriage and having children. Ed told Gaffney his former wife had been unable to get pregnant.

Gaffney became pregnant soon after. She said that Ed at first demanded she have an abortion before changing his mind.

With his name not on the birth certificate after the baby was born, he asked Gaffney to sign some paperwork allowing him to claim his right as the baby's father.

She has since admitted she did not understand the papers, but signed them anyway. The couple, who were living apart but planned to move in together, shared caring for the baby.

Evidence: Without understanding the adoption paperwork, Gaffney signed it

But one day, Gaffney did not return the baby to its mother.

'That’s when he told me that the paperwork I actually signed was me giving up the rights, not to him to have his rights,' she told NBC10.

'It was me giving up my rights so his wife could adopt my baby, and I said, "Are you kidding me?"'

He told Gaffney he was actually called Emmitt Dippold, still married and in the process of adopting the baby - with his wife.

'I couldn’t even believe that someone was capable of something like that,' Gaffney said.

She took Dippold and his wife to court and the adoption was overturned based on fraud.

But in court documents, he denied he 
had claimed he was a Dupont. He said Gaffney may have thought he was as 
his email reads ‘ew-dupont'.

He also said he never wanted her to get an abortion and denied talk about marriage, according to NBC10.

Dippold added that Gaffney should have known he was marriage as there were pictures of him and his wife dotted around his home.

Dippold and his wife have filed an appeal.
