It is an issue that arouses high emotions.

But the Archbishop of Canterbury’s opposition to gay marriage provoked a response from a fellow man of the cloth that was anything but holy.

Not only that, the outburst was recorded on Facebook for all to see. So outraged was the Rev Marcus Ramshaw after Justin Welby spoke in the House of Lords against the proposed same-sex marriage law that he condemned him on the social networking site as a ‘w*****’.

He also went further, describing the choice of Archbishop Welby to lead the Church of England as a ‘massive mistake’.

The church has since admonished him – by leaving another Facebook message under his original posting.

On Monday Archbishop Welby said the 
Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill would effectively abolish the 
traditional institution of marriage, which he said was a cornerstone of 
society.

He said it would create ‘different and unequal’ forms of marriage.

In response Mr Ramshaw, who like the 
Archbishop trained for the priesthood at Cranmer Hall, Durham, called 
for a petition urging him to resign.

He wrote: ‘What really upsets me is 
nasty people such as Justin Welby robbing me of my faith in the church, 
he does not speak in my name and I think he is a w*****, but I’m not 
going to stop being a Christian or a priest.’

Rant: Rev Ramshaw then called for a petition to force Welby out of the job at the top of the Church

The posting came to the attention of church officials, one of whom admonished Mr Ramshaw in a follow-up posting.

The Rev Arun Arora, director of 
communications at the church’s headquarters in Westminster, wrote: 
‘Clearly you are upset with the political stance of the C of E 
leadership.

Defence: Justin Welby was defended by his PR team who said: 'Whilst I am sure this will be water off a duck's back for Archbishop Justin, I don't think calling someone a w***** is the best way of engaging'

'However that is no justification for your language and 
vitriol. Calling another Christian a w***** doesn’t work for me as a 
priestly response.

‘I hope you might find time to reconsider the expression of your anger and delete some of these posts.’

Mr Ramshaw replied: ‘I will. I don’t 
know you at all but I see you are director of comms, please specify 
exactly what you wish me to withdraw and I will oblige.’

Mr Arora responded: ‘How about removing the line about Justin “a w*****”?’

He later added: ‘Any right minded person would find a priest calling his archbishop an onanist to be utterly outrageous.’

Mr Ramshaw, who is not currently 
licensed to officiate because he is a full-time carer, said later: ‘Why 
is the church, after the whole women bishops debacle, now excluding 
people who actually want to get married?

‘I suspect many bishops, clergy and laity support gay marriage but we do not have a vote.’

Last night Mr Arora said: ‘The issue 
of same-sex marriage is an emotive one.

'There are a variety of views 
within the Church and much of that debate takes place online.

‘While I am sure this will be water 
off a duck’s back for Archbishop Justin, I think it was right to 
challenge Marcus’s approach.’

The Bill passed the Lords on Tuesday 
by a voting ratio of 2-1.

A ‘wrecking’ amendment designed to block the 
Bill which was tabled by the crossbench Peer Lord Dear was defeated by 
390 votes to 148.
