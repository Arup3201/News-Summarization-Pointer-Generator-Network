Dai Young has admitted Leinster's Jimmy Gopperth could replace Andy Goode as Wasps' frontline fly-half next season.

Rugby director Young confirmed Wasps are in talks with former Newcastle playmaker Gopperth, and expects his recruitment drive to be complete by the end of January.

Young is targeting five players as Wasps build on their move to Coventry's Ricoh Arena, with 'prize asset' Joe Launchbury already tied to a new deal.

Goode remains in negotiations over a new Wasps contract, but the 34-year-old's chances could be limited with Scotland's Ruaridh Jackson still to return from long-term knee trouble.

The Coventry-born goal-kicker set a new individual Premiership points record of 33 in Wasps' debut at his hometown Ricoh Arena in Sunday's 48-16 victory over London Irish, but is now fighting for his future.

'Absolutely Jimmy Gopperth is in the mix,' said Young.

'There are a number of high-profile 10s that are available this year, and that's all part of the bigger picture.

'We're hoping to be able to resolve that over the next few weeks.

'We're in discussions with Andy about moving things forward, the same as we are with a number of other players.

'We're certainly not far off resolving things on the recruitment front right across the board really, so certainly by the end of January things will be a lot clearer.'

Gopperth's Leinster exit has been all-but inevitable since Ireland and British and Irish Lions fly-half Johnny Sexton completed a deal to return to his home province from Racing Metro for next term.

The 31-year-old's potential arrival at Wasps next season could leave the picture too crowded for Goode.

The former Leicester and England fly-half offered a timely reminder of his talents in home city Coventry on Sunday as Wasps claimed debut victory at the Ricoh.

Former Cardiff boss Young admitted Goode remains confident he can continue to produce the goods at Premiership level.

'Andy certainly seems to think he can keep going, but at the end of the day he's 35 next year isn't he?' said Young.

'Recruitment's not carried out by reacting to one good game or one poor game, though.

'You're looking at what you've got, whether it's right for them as well as us to retain them, and then also at alternatives.

'The move to the Ricoh has helped us in terms of attracting and retaining players.

'We're still in with a shout in Europe but it's hugely important we try to get into the top six in the league again this season to stay in the top European competition.

'Retaining Joe Launchbury has helped too; it is a signal to everyone that things can't be too bad here and that we're moving in the right direction.

'We're probably looking at four or five players to come in, and maybe the same number moving in the other direction.

'But we ought to know a lot more by the end of January.'
