A 91-year-old war hero has given away more than a dozen gallantry medals in protest at the way elderly people in the UK are treated like 'rubbish.'

Stanley Gordon Fox earned an assortment of honours including the Military Cross for his heroics in World War II.

But now the disenchanted OAP says he no longer feels any affinity with the country he served with such distinction.

Days gone by: Stanley Fox, circled, says he and his fellow soldiers were once proud to be soldiers but the country today is no longer 'what we fought for'

He has sent his collection of 23 medals to a children’s hospice along with medals earned by his brother and his father, who fought in Boer Wars and the First World War.

He said: 'No one seems to care these days, older people are just treated like a bit of rubbish.

'The country is not as we all hoped. It is not what we fought for. We were proud to fight for the country and I was proud to wear the medals.

'Now I just hope they can go to help the children and the future and make it better.'

Stanley, from Bideford, Devon, joined up at 14 and remained fiercely loyal to his country despite enduring two years in a PoW camp in Africa.

Mr Fox's collection of honours spans more than 100 years and includes the the Military Cross, the General Service Medal, the Long Service Good Conduct medal and the British War medal

He served with the South Wales Borderers and the Royal Artillery before leaving the Army at age 46, having earned the Military Cross, the Queen’s South Africa Star medal, the War and Victory medal and the St John Ambulance Brigade medal for South Africa.

His vast collection also includes the General Service Medal, the Long Service Good Conduct medal and the British War medal.

He has now handed them all to the Children’s Hospice South West to be auctioned off for charity.

Joyce Comfort, 68, a volunteer for elderly support group TorrAGE who helps Stanley every week, said: 'Our older people have died for us, if it wasn’t for them we would be up the creek.

'Something has got to change, we need to do more for the elderly.'

Tony Siddall, a member of Devon Senior Voice and a welfare officer for the Royal British Legion, added: 'I am deeply upset to learn someone has felt they need to go to such lengths to make this sort of protest.

'Some of the older generation feel strongly about what they did for their country. It is a great shame this has happened.'

Roy Lucas, a Royal British Legion case worker and the chairman of the North Devon branch of the Royal Air Forces Association, said: 'I feel very disappointed when I hear of ex-servicemen who feel they have been let down by the junior elements of the country.

'I understand exactly where he is coming from, when I go collecting for the legion I see middle-aged people completely disinterested and almost wonder why I am there.
