While the recent snowfall has proved to be a headache for most, there is at least one exception who seems delighted at the latest flurries.

Giant Panda Qing Feng couldn't contain his delight after fresh snowfall covered his pen at Yantai Zoo in Shandong Province, China, earlier this week.

The five-year-old Panda was captured rolling around in the icy cold snow before play fighting with a tyre.

Paws for thought: Giant Panda Qing Feng appears a little confused when snow first fell in his pen at Yantai Zoo in Yantai, Shandong Province, China

Steady! Five-year-old Qing Feng attempts to climb into the tyre hoop - but quickly loses his balance

Qing Feng appeared confused at first before quickly jumping into the tyre hoop.

But he didn't have much luck keeping his balance and was soon dangling from the tyre by his back paws before falling off entirely into the snow.

His playmate, five-year-old Giant Panda Hua Ao was equally excited by the snow and attempted to walk a snow-covered branch.Â

Balancing act: Qing Feng's slightly more adventurous playmate, five-year-old Hua Ao attempts to cross a snow-covered branch

Giant pandas are solitary bears when in the wild, usually preferring their own company when foraging in Chinese bamboo forests.

They are an endangered species, with less than 2,000 thought to be left roaming free in the cool forests that are their natural habitat.

They mostly eat bamboo, but in captivity are also enjoy being fed honey, eggs, fish, yams, leaves, oranges, bananas and other special treats.

Never mind the cold: Hua Ao attempts to cover himself head to paw in snow after rolling on the ground

Tired out: Qing Feng takes a quick break after all his running around at Yantai Zoo

Best friends: Hua Ao and Qing Feng were both transferred to Yantai Zoo last year
