The toy company that gained notoriety earlier this year by creating a meth lab play set inspired by the hit TV show Breaking Bad is at it again, this time turning their attention to adult entertainment.

Just in time for Christmas, the Chicago-based Citizen Brick specializing in custom-printed Lego pieces has come out with the Citizen Brick Center for the Performing Arts - a play set featuring a swinging strip club scene.

The plastic jiggly joint is called the Foxy Blox club, and it comes with buxom strippers in bikini tops, a hairy-chested male dancer and a stage with a pole in the middle. 

They're at it again: Citizen Brick, the company that came out with a Breaking Bad-inspired meth lab set earlier this year, has now created a strip club toy set called The Center for the Performing Arts

Cheeky: The set comes with two customized Lego strippers in bikini tops and G-strings 

Plastic showgirls: The adult toy even comes with a stripper pole on a raised platform

The company posted this tongue-in-cheek description of the grownup toy on its website: 'The Citizen Brick Center for the Performing Arts is place where dreamers can dream, and dancers can dance. And dream. And also dance.’

The attention to detail is impressive: from plastic dollar bills scattered around the podium to the strippers' fishnet stockings and clear plastic pumps, this set has got it all.

The decor at the Foxy Blox is classic nudy bar circa 1970s, complete with a 'Girls Girls Girls' poster on the wall, zebra-printed couches and pink leopard-printed floors.

A series of colorful hologram foil printed paintings and a palm tree in the corner add a touch of class to the establishment.

The set comes with four minifigs: two scantily clad female strippers, a mustachioed male performer with a bow tie a la Magic Mike and a pompadour coif, and a DJ in sunglasses positioned behind a turntable.

Make it rain: To make the Foxy Blox club feel like a real strip joint, the toy makers included a pile of plastic dollar bills

Something for everyone: The Foxy Blox is an equal opportunity strip club where hairy-chested, mustachioed performers are just as welcome as buxom female entertainers

Supporting characters: No jiggly joint would be complete without a DJ who knows his way around a turntable

 Pricey present: The Lego-inspired sets are available to pre-order for $275 

The adult play set is currently available to pre-order on Citizen Brick's site for $275.

In an effort to avoid any confusion (or trademark lawsuits), the plucky Chicago manufacturer posted a disclaimer online making it clear that they are not affiliated with the Danish toy giant The LEGO Group.

‘Our friends at Lego asked that we remind you... “This is not a LEGO® Product. These are re-used LEGO elements that have been repackaged or altered from their original form,’ the notice reads.
