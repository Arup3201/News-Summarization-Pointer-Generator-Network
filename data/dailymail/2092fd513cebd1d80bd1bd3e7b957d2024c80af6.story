Cristiano Ronaldo has given Portugal a boost on the eve of the World Cup by resuming training.

The Real Madrid forward has been 
struggling with tendinosis in his knee and a muscle injury in his left 
thigh since the end of the domestic campaign and there were serious fears
 he may miss Portugal’s opening game of the World Cup against Germany on
 June 16.

However, the Portuguese Football Association confirmed encouraging news on Saturday, nine days before the country's opener in Salvador.

The FPF statement read: 'Cristiano Ronaldo and Raul Meireles integrated with the remaining group of players.'

Despite his injuries, Ronaldo has spoken of his desire to win the World Cup with his national side.

And
 while the national team captain admits Portugal are not favourites for 
the World Cup – they have been drawn in a group with Germany, Ghana and 
the United States – he said he would like to win a title with the 
national team ‘one day’.

‘We aren’t favourites but we will try to perform our best as always. We know we have a difficult group stage,’ he told sportlobster.com.

‘In my opinion, we have the strongest group of the World Cup, but we should take it one step at a time.

‘We
 have an important opener against Germany, before we face Ghana and 
finally the United States. Our goal is obviously to pass the group stage
 and then we’ll see.

Midfielder Meireles had been struggling with a muscular problem.

However, central defender Pepe worked away from the main group of players as he continued his recovery from a leg injury.

The statement added: 'Pepe is carrying out his rehabilitation and sport specific exercises in the field individually.'
