Atheists are threatening to sue over a 9/11 memorial.

The American Atheists, based in New Jersey, told the mayor of Princeton this week that they will take the town to court if the side of a beam recovered from the World Trade Center site was displayed on public property or publicly funded.

The letter says the beam must be placed in a ‘designated free speech zone that enables members of all other religious groups or otherwise to place their own memorials with their own unique symbols,’ according to the Times of Trenton.

‘While the intention to commemorate those who died at the World Trade Center is admirable and appropriate for a community, the use of such a singular religious image will be grossly offensive and alienating to many people,’ attorney Bruce Afran wrote in the letter, which asked for a response by Sept. 3.

Princeton Deputy Fire Chief Roy James acquired the beam for the town on his own, according to the Times. He wants to place it on state-owned land near the Princeton Battle Monument, the Times reported. Princeton has also made land for a memorial available near the old borough hall, the paper noted.

Designed by an architecture firm donating its time, the memorial is estimated to cost about $100,000, reported the Times. James told the paper the money could be obtained from the town or through donations.

Putting the memorial on public land and/or funding it with taxpayer money is where The American Atheists object. They are threatening to file an injunction if either, or both, comes to pass.

'We have our attorney looking into if we would be open to litigation for this and what the risk is,' Princeton Mayor Liz Lempert told WPVI.

The inclusion of a religious symbol also worried some town council members, with one fearing it would give the impression government favors one religion over others and another saying concerned residents planned to file a lawsuit, they told the Times.

James defended the cross, saying it is more a part of history than it is a religious symbol, explaining to WPVI that rescue and recovery workers at Ground Zero carved the crosses into the beams where they found fallen firefighters.

Afran disagrees.

‘While the image of the cross on the girder is the space remaining after a cross was carved from the girder, it nonetheless presents the indisputable image of a cross on a memorial for those who died in the attacks of 9/11 — a religious image in remembrance of the dead,’ he wrote, according to the Times. ‘It goes without saying that the image of the cross is a common religious feature on the graves of the deceased who adhered in life to a Christian faith.’

The town could avoid all this by simply turning the beam on its side so the cross is not visible.

James was initially planning to have the memorial in place by this September, that is now highly unlikely given the possibility of this issue being settled in a courtroom.

Calls placed by MailOnline to The American Atheists, Princeton officials and Afran seeking further comment were not answered.
