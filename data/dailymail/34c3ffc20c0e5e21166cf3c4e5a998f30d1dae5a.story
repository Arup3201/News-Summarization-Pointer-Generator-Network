Facing jail: Edward Alexander Somerset subjected his wife to more than two decades of abuse, a court heard yesterday

An aristocrat from one of Britain’s grandest families is facing jail after subjecting his wife to more than two decades of domestic abuse.

Edward Alexander Somerset – a son of the 11th Duke of Beaufort – kicked his wife Caroline  and pulled her hair while affected by ‘drink or drugs or both’, a court  heard yesterday.

Lady Edward suffered bruising and a dislocated finger during the 22 years of violence.

The couple, who have two grown-up daughters, are now divorcing after three decades of marriage.

Yesterday Somerset, 55, admitted four counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.

Looking gaunt and unshaven, he wore a dark blue suit with a red tie, pocket handkerchief and silver earring as he spoke clearly to plead guilty to the charges.

Somerset admitted attacking his wife at the home they shared on the 52,000-acre Badminton Estate in Gloucestershire – home of the world-famous Badminton Horse Trials – and in France.

His lawyer William Clegg QC told Bristol Crown Court: ‘Between 1990 and 2011 there were incidents of violence between the two, often in drunk or drugs or both, whereby the complainant received injuries. They included scratches and hair pulls.’

Judge Mark Horton, who will sentence the father-of-two in February, told the aristocrat the offences were so serious a prison sentence was possible.

The estranged couple have not seen each other for a year and divorce proceedings are set to be finalised in the near future.

He will also consider whether a restraining order to protect Somerset's wife from her estranged husband should be put in place.

'At this stage, I am unable to say a custodial sentence would not follow,' the judge told Somerset.

'Given that this reflects a substantial period of domestic violence, this is a case where I should like the defendant to meet with a probation officer.'

Judge Horton said the guilty pleas reflected a 'different picture' to how Somerset, referred to simply as Edward Somerset in court, had described the case during police interview.

Treatment: It is understood that one of the recent alleged incidents left his wife hospitalised

Luxury: The attacks happened on the sprawling Badminton Estate in Gloucestershire where the couple lived

'It doesn’t appear to me from having 
read it that he had quite appreciated the seriousness of the domestic 
violence in his marriage.

'As
I see it, there has been quite a dramatic period where things should 
they have been approached differently, might have prevented this 
violence to the complainant in this case.'

He admitted a 'deliberate and hard' kick to his wife at Essex House on the Badminton Estate between January 1 2011 and November 29 2011.

The aristocrat, who has no previous convictions, pleaded guilty to two further assaults, where he bruised his wife in October last year.

Somerset also admitted assaulting his wife on numerous occasions between January 1990 and December 2011, giving her a variety of injuries including a bruise, scratches and pulled hair.

His guilty plea for that charge, covering a 22-year period, represented 'incidents of violence between the two, often in drink or drugs or both'  the court heard.

Case: Bristol Crown Court heard the incidents of violence between the two often involved drink or drugs

Appearance: The 55-year-old was released on conditional bail and will return to court on February 6

Prosecuting, Eleanor Laws QC, said Somerset’s wife feared him and was seeking a restraining order.

'She
would say she still has fears of this defendant because of his 
offending and she is in a very emotional state,' Miss Laws said.

'While
she says there has been no real direct contact between the two of them 
there is evidence that the defendant’s elder brother, working, so it 
would seem, on behalf of the defendant’s father, had contacted the 
complainant’s cousin, Lord Raleigh, and arranged a meeting in October, 
during which there was a discussion about finances, dropping the case, 
paying for advice for the complainant.

The Badminton Estate lies in the heart of the Gloucestershire countryside and is home to the Duke and Duchess of Beaufort.

The  Duke of Beaufort title was created by Charles II in 1682 for Henry Somerset, the 3rd Marquess of Worcester.

The
family are descendants in the male line from the French dynasty, the 
House of Plantagenet, through John of Gaunt and Edward III.

The sprawling estate dates back to the 17th century and is where the game of Badminton was invented in 1863.

Lord
Somerset and his wife lived in the grade-two-listed Essex House, an 
18th-century building which stands at the village's entrance.

He
is the third of four children of the 11th Duke of Beaufort, 85 year-old
David Somerset, who is estimated to be worth £135 million.

His eldest brother Henry John Fitzroy, Marquess of Worcester, 60, is heir to the estate and title.

'It was this meeting which she found 
out about and got to hear what was discussed which devastated her and 
put her under considerable stress in the run up to this trial.'

Miss
Laws said there was 'nothing to suggest' Somerset had been behind the 
meeting but was the 'sort of conduct' his wife was 'vulnerable to'.

Representing Somerset, William Clegg QC, said his client would not oppose a restraining order.

'The two haven’t seen each other for over a year,' he said. 'Lord Somerset’s view as far as a restraining order is concerned is that he would be perfectly happy to have such an order imposed.

'He accepts his marriage is completely over. He thinks it by far the best that he have no contact with the complainant, and she has no contact with him.

'I have no instructions from the Duke or his brother.'

Mr Clegg said divorce proceedings between Somerset and Caroline are 'at a stage where hopefully things can be finalised between them'.

'The children are now at an age where they can make their own way between their parents,' Mr Clegg said.

Judge Horton released Somerset on conditional bail after advising him to be 'frank with the reality of what has taken place' during the marriage with the probation service.

'The court looks forward to seeing you again on the 6th of February,' the judge added.

A charge of assault causing actual bodily harm carries a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment, according to sentencing guidelines.
