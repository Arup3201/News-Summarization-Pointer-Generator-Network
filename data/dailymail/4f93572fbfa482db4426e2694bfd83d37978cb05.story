Rio Ferdinand’s move to QPR could be announced on Tuesday after boss Harry Redknapp revealed he will meet the former Manchester United defender for talks.

The central-defender is a free agent following his release from Old Trafford last month.

Redknapp told talkSPORT: ‘He arrives back today so I am going to meet him and hopefully we can get it sorted.

‘He has not been difficult to deal with. He wants to play and he is not expensive.

‘He wants to come and play at QPR now so hopefully we can get it done.’

Ferdinand has been heavily linked with a move to QPR in recent weeks following their promotion to the Premier League.

But the move has been shrouded in doubt over a wage disagreement after QPR had a last-minute rethink on Ferdinand’s personal terms.

However, Redknapp believes he can still lure Ferdinand to Loftus Road and hopes to conclude a deal today after the defender returned from Brazil where he had been working as a BBC pundit for the World Cup.
