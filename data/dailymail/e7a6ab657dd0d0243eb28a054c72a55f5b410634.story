Ponies, iPads and enough handbags to make Victoria Beckham blush: no, these aren't the contents of Harrods but some of the many gifts bestowed on 12-year-old Chase McKenna.

Like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's Veruca Salt, Chase, and her siblings Mackenzie, seven and Rhys, 14, are given everything they could possibly dream of by doting parents, Kelly and Alan, both 33.

'I like labels: Ralph, Juicy, Gucci,' reveals the 12-year-old, who lives with her family in Bexley, of her lavish wardrobe. 'I don't do Primark!'

Expensive tastes: Chase McKenna says she won't wear Primark and only likes Gucci and Ralph Lauren clothes

Now junior pageant queen Chase and her two siblings are to appear on new Channel 5 documentary, The 12 Year Old Shopaholic and Other Big Spending Kids.

In it, she shows off her favourite clothes, most of which are by Ralph Lauren and Gucci, as well as her pony, which costs her parents £2,000 a year to maintain.

But while Chase and her penchant for expensive clothes might sound like most parent's worst nightmare, her mother Kelly reveals that Chase is exactly what she hoped she'd be and says she has dressed her in designer gear since birth.

'I had my kids young and I felt like if I dressed them in designer gear then people would think I was doing an alright job,' she admits.

Unsurprisingly, Chase's demands have grown increasingly lavish - and that's before you get to her impressively large allowance.

Scary: If Chase doesn't get what she wants, she gives her father what she calls 'The Face'

'I've 
already had £150 this week and it’s only Tuesday' smirks the 
12-year-old, 'If I ask Dad for something and don't get a yes straight 
away I give him "The Face".'

And
 it seems the threat of getting 'The Face' is enough to persuade father 
Alan to part with just about any sum of money Chase cares to name.

'I say: "Oh, Daddy, pleeease?" And he goes: "OK, how much do you want?" and I go: "Can I have £300?" Each time I go higher.'

But of all the presents Chase has been given, the most expensive was her pony - which even her mother said gave her pause for thought.

'We weren't 100 per cent on the horse because it costs £2,000 a year to take care of and we said no to start but Chase really 
proved herself,' says Kelly.

'She gave up her weekends and mucked out the horse and Alan enjoys the horse too so everyone benefits.'

So how exactly do the young couple fund their prima donna daughter's extravagant spending habits?

'Alan has his own building company and I don't work,' explains Kelly.  'We are useless with money but we're not on benefits. Alan works for it.'

Spoilt: Like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's Veruca Salt, Chase gets everything she wants

Nevertheless, although the McKenna children do get just about everything their hearts could desire, Kelly says there have been moments when they've struggled with money.

'There was a time a few months ago when we had no work and the kids were 
as good as gold,' she reveals. 'They didn't ask for anything. Rhys who's only 14 even 
got a gardening job to help out.'

'People say to me: "Get a grip girl! You've got no carpet and your kids are running around in Ralph Lauren jeans!"'

She does, however, think her spending habits are spiralling out of control and says she needs to get a grip.

'People say to me: "Get a grip girl! You've got no carpet and your kids are running around in Ralph Lauren jeans!"'

According to Kelly, her erratic spending habits were inherited from her own mother who also took a cavalier approach to money.

'My mum and dad split up and she had to work two jobs so we didn't have a normal upbringing,' explains Kelly.

'Some days, we would get picked up by Lamborghinis and limousines from school. Some days my mum would be rooting around in the cupboards and others we would be in a posh restaurant. I think she was trying to find a substitute for my dad not being there.'

That, however, hasn't stopped her from following suit. 'My mum always said: "You're not here forever so spend it while you can" and I think she's right.'

But does she worry that Chase, so keen to splash her father's cash, will grow up with the same attitude to money.

Amazingly, Kelly thinks not. 'No,' she insists. 'She's seen our house and she's already said "I don't want to live like this!"'
