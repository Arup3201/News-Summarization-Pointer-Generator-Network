He scored the goal that decided the £134million play-off final at Wembley, but Bobby Zamora is set to be placed on the scrapheap by QPR.

The striker, 33, scored the dramatic late winner against Derby at Wembley last weekend, but Sportsmail has learned that QPR are planning life without him in the top flight.

Zamora had scored only three goals all season for QPR after another injury-ravaged campaign, when he was involved in only 21 games in all competitions.

With Rangers looking to reduce their wage bill – Zamora is thought to be earning around £60,000-a-week – they have decided he is surplus to requirements. This is expected to be confirmed in Friday’s transfer planning meeting when their budget and strategy for the new season will be confirmed.

Former Brighton, Tottenham, West Ham and Fulham striker Zamora has cost more than £12million in transfer fees in his career. The Barking-born forward was also picked twice for England.

After scoring against Derby on Saturday, he said: ‘My contract is up so we’ll see what happens. It would be nice to stay.

'I’ve been good enough to play for England. Fabio Capello does not pick idiots. I still believe I am a Premier League player.’

QPR have since decided that his future is destined to be elsewhere.

A source close to the striker said: ‘Bobby feels he can still do a job in the top flight and will be interested to see who else comes in for him. He is keeping his options open.’

Scoring the winner for QPR is the second time Zamora has decided a play-off final, having scored the winner for West Ham against Preston in 2004.

‘Bobby scores important goals,’ said the source. ‘When he is fit, he will deliver in the box, as he showed at Wembley.’
