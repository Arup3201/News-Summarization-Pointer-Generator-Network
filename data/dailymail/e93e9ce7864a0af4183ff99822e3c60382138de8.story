Google has asked the High Court to throw out former Formula One boss Max Mosley's claim for damages over 'sex orgy' pictures as a judge admitted awarding compensation would be 'difficult'

Google has asked the High Court to throw out former Formula One boss Max Mosley's claim for damages over 'sex orgy' pictures as a judge admitted awarding compensation would be 'difficult'.

Mosley, 74, is seeking damages from Google UK and parent company Google Inc, and an injunction banning the publication of the photographs on the search engine.

He has brought a claim against US-based Google Inc and Google UK under the Data Protection Act and against Google Inc for misuse of private information.

However, Google’s lawyers say that his case is unsustainable in fact and law and should be struck out. They also argue that permission to serve the claim on Google Inc outside the jurisdiction of the court should be set aside. 

The litigation follows Mosley’s 2008 privacy victory against the now-defunct News Of The World newspaper when he won £60,000 compensation after it accused him of taking part in a 'sick Nazi orgy' with five prostitutes.

Mosley, the son of the 1930s Fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley, did not dispute taking part in the sadomasochistic roleplay at a rented Chelsea basement flat, but said it was consensual and private, with no Nazi overtones.

He said that his life had been devastated by the March 2008 expose and by the newspaper putting secretly-filmed footage on its website, which attracted at least 3.5 million hits.

Today, Mosley continued his battle against Google in London’s High Court, but Mr Justice Mitting said damages ‘may simply not be available’ to him.

However, the judge said some form of injunction banning the images could be ‘much less problematic’.

Google’s counsel, Antony White QC, said today that the threshold test was whether a person had a reasonable expectation of privacy, taking into account all the circumstances of the case.

'There can be few privacy claims which relate to material which has been quite so widely publicised over so many years as the images which are the subject of this claim,' he told Mr Justice Mitting.

He said that, shortly after the expose, Mr Justice Eady refused Mosley a temporary injunction against News Group Newspapers (NGN), saying that he no longer had any reasonable expectation of privacy and, even if he had, the 'dam has effectively burst' and an order would be futile.

During the damages trial, Mr Justice Eady ruled that the newspaper article was not in the public interest.

He said Mosley 'had a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to sexual activities (albeit unconventional) carried on between consenting adults on private property.'

But he branded the former President of the motoring organisation the Federation Internationale de L’Automobile 'reckless and almost self destructive' and 'the author of his own misfortune.'

After the trial, the judge did grant a permanent injunction against NGN, preventing re-publication, on the basis that it should not be entitled to profit from its own wrongdoing, but this did not prohibit other parties outside England and Wales from using images already in the public domain.

'The images, including the 95-second video, have now been continuously available online for over six years and have in all likelihood been viewed by millions of people around the world,' said Mr White.

“There is no previous successful claim for misuse of private information which relates to material which has been so widely disseminated and which is so well-known.

'If the claimant had lost his reasonable expectation of privacy back in April 2008, within days of publication, it is clear that six years on he cannot have any reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to the images.'

Mr White said that, notwithstanding this, Google Inc had used its notice and takedown procedures to block images when specific URLs had been provided because, whatever the strict legal position, it had some sympathy for Mosley and wished to avoid a dispute.

He described Mosley, who was in court for the hearing, as someone who had remained in the public eye as 'an admirable campaigner for privacy rights'.

Mosley has campaigned for privacy since the article was printed, backing pressure group Hacked Off and giving evidence in the Leveson Enquiry.

He has also been successful in legal bids to stop Google from directing users to images of the orgy via the French and German courts.

Mr White added that Google Inc, as the operator of Search, was not a 'publisher' of the images for the purposes of a privacy claim and no general obligation to monitor could be imposed on it.

Mosley’s lawyers say that Google’s application is misconceived and want it dismissed with a defence filed within 28 days.

His counsel, Hugh Tomlinson QC, said that although Mosley had pursued third parties who continued to publish in several jurisdictions, the image remained accessible to users of Google Search.

Google accepted that links to the images should be removed from its indices, but would only do so after Mosley sent them the precise URL for each image, which meant he was forced to engage in what a Canadian court had described as an 'endless game of "whack-a-mole"''.

Mr Tomlinson added that this was despite the fact that, as Google now accepted, it was possible for it to take technical steps to prevent the images being indexed by Google Search in the first place.

Faced with 'this lack of co-operation' from Google, Mosley had brought his claim in July last year.

Mr Tomlinson added: 'Despite its dominance of the online search market in the UK, Google has consistently sought to avoid appearing before the English courts to defend itself on the merits.

'Whilst accepting that it should take material down - as in the present case - it has consistently refused to use automated technical means to assist individuals.

'The court should dismiss these applications and the defendants should be required to defend themselves at a full trial.'

Mr Justice Mitting said he was not bound by Mr Justice Eady’s decision, since it was an interim order, adding he did not ‘see why, even if the fact is public, the photographs should not be subject to continuing restraint’.

‘If you accept as a premise that the possession alone of photographs of an intimate act is itself a breach of privacy and confidentiality, then it seems to me that you are entitled to restrain it, whether or not it is in the public domain,' he added.

However, the judge indicated Mosley was unlikely to be able to win any sort of damages from Google.

The judge said, ‘That particular remedy may simply not be available to the claimant’.

Later he said that ‘the difficult part of Mr Tomlinson’s case is that [damages] part of his case’.

But he said ordering some form of injunction appeared ‘much less problematic’.

The lawyers mentioned the possibility of ‘fingerprinting’ pictures, which would identify them as being unfit for publication.

Mr White conceded it was possible to mark certain pictures in this way and said it was not a difficult exercise for Google to undertake.

Mr Justice Mitting appeared to favour this solution, saying it was ‘strongly arguable that there is a difference between something you can’t do anything about and something you can do something easily about’.

On a separate issue, Mr White denied that Google was a ‘publisher’ of material, stating search results were created by ‘an algorithmic exercise without human knowledge or involvement’.

Quoting an earlier judgement, he said Mosley’s case was ‘impermissibly speculative’. 

The hearing continues tomorrow when the judge is likely to reserve his decision to a later date.
