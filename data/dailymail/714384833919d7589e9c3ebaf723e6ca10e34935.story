A coroner has ordered the police to investigate a care home after a 93-year-old woman suffered serious scalding and died.

Freda Owens was rushed into hospital from The Croft House Rest Home, in Freckleton, Lancashire, Â  with scalds to her lower back.

But after contracting pneumonia she died weeks later. Following an inquest, the home is now the subject of a police investigation into how Mrs Owens suffered her injuries.

Probe: A coroner has ordered the police to investigate a care home after a 93-year-old Freda Owens suffered serious scalding. She later died at the Royal Preston Hospital

Police confirmed that investigation is at its 'early stages' but said they would be speaking to a 'number of people' as they bid to establish the circumstances surrounding the pensioner's tragic death.

The home had already been told by the Care Quality Commission that it must make improvements, including making sure patients were 'protected from abuse or the risk of abuse'.

Mrs Owens was first admitted to Royal Preston Hospital from the home with scalds on November 22 and died there on January 3 after contracting pneumonia.

During an inquest hearing, PC Helen Leeson, 
coroner's officer, said: 'Mrs Owens had some scalds to her sacrum and 
deteriorated over a time in hospital. She died on January 3

'A post-mortem examination was carried 
out on January 10 and the cause of death was bronchial pneumonia due to 
necrotic, chronic pressure ulcer to the left hip and burns or scalds to 
the buttock.'

The inquest into Mrs Owens' death was opened and adjourned by Blackpool coroner Anne Hind. Mrs Hind said: 'We reported it to the police. They would not have known otherwise.'

An inspection by the Care Quality Commission last July revealed the home needed to make improvements in key areas, and the commission said an unannounced follow-up inspection will take place to establish whether those improvements have been made.

The areas where standards were not being met included ensuring people got 'safe and appropriate care which meets their needs and supports their rights', people were 'protected from abuse, or the risk of abuse and their human rights are respected and upheld', and given necessary medicines and cared for in 'safe and accessible surroundings'.

The report said a lack of staff knowledge meant residents were not 'fully protected from the risk of unlawful or excessive control'.

A spokesman for Fylde Council said: 'The
police are the lead organisation and we are acting in a supporting 
role. They've asked us to help in a health and safety capacity to look 
at the working practices of the home.'

A police spokesman said: 'The coroner 
has asked Lancashire Constabulary to investigate the circumstances 
regarding the death of a 93-year-old woman who died following an 
incident at the Croft House Rest Home, Kirkham Road, Freckleton, on 
November 22, 2012.'
