A newly erected aluminium sculpture  has sparked public uprising after locals have claimed it looks like a penis.

Transit Cloud, which is composed in part by four  mesh cloud forms, was constructed 8m above New Lynn train station in Auckland last Friday.

The Auckland sculptor stands by the controversial artwork, claiming all art should provoke a reaction, reports New Zealand Herald.

The Auckland-Council commissioned artwork cost about AU$190,000, as part of a bid to reinvigorate the quiet and traditionally working class suburb.

But locals have taken jabs at the artwork, claiming it is inappropriate for such a prominent location.

In a video with 3 News, a trio of giggling teenagers say: 'it looks like a giant private part.'

'I was surprised that it was erected,' says another local. 'Maybe the angle could be slightly shifted to change the visual concept?'

Joy Dale, of Mt Roskill, said: 'It's certainly not a cloud. It looks like a penis.'

She said the sculpture was a waste of taxpayers' money and the council should have spent the money on better security in the area. 

Sculptor Gregor Kregar said it was never intended to be a phallic image,  rather that it is intended to be a reference to the cloudsand raindrops.

'Art is out there to stir reaction,' Kregar told the Herald.

He said he was surprised by the public response to the artwork, which he believes is 'fun and joyful.' 

Kregar has claimed the next development of the artwork-a 50 meter string of neon lights set to be ignited at night-will transform the appearance of the sculpture and alter public perceptions for the better.

Daily Mail Australia has contacted Mr Kregar for comment.
