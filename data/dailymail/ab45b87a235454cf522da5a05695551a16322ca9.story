Internet shoppers could soon be hit with a new sales tax, making online purchases up to 11 per cent more expensive.

Congress is considering new legislation that would allow states to force sales tax on internet purchases, which would help make up states' budget shortfalls.

Meanwhile Amazon, the world's largest internet retailer, is making deals with individual states to collect sales taxes regardless of what Congress decides.

New tax: Internet shoppers are likely to be hit with a new sales-tax as the proposal boasts strong support from both Democrat and Republican senators

Currently, online shoppers enjoy a 5 to 
10 per cent ‘discount’ thanks to no sales-tax, which is implemented on 
goods brought at bricks-and-mortar stores.

If the new legislation – the Marketplace Fairness Act – is passed, states could potentially rake in $23 billion each from online sales tax collections, burgeoning their financial health.

An LG high-definition TV costing $560 on online retailer Overstock.com will cost internet shoppers varying amounts depending on their states' sales tax. 

The TV will cost:

$602 in Florida (sales tax - 7.5%)

$620.48 in California (sales tax - 10.8%)

$609.84 in New York (sales tax - 8.9%)

$588 in Maine (sales tax - 5%)

$624.40 in Illinois (sales tax - 11.5%)

Internet retailers could have to pay 
sales taxes to any state from which an Internet user placed an order, 
even if the company is entirely located in other states.

The amount of sales tax applied to online goods will vary according to individual state’s tax codes and sales tax rates, which range from less than 1 per cent to more than 10 per cent.

The internet sales tax in each state will be set at the same amount as the state's sales tax.

Due to the different rates, New Yorkers will pay about $1.8 billion more while Californians will shell out $4.2 billion.

The average U.S. online shopper will soon be spending $1,700 annually so the new tax will cost each person approximately $125 every year, according to Forrester Research, reported NBC news.

As supporters of the legislation have keenly pointed out, adding a sales tax to online purchases will balance out the playing field for retailers where internet shopping has threatened or killed off smaller, independent bricks-and-mortar stores.

The Marketplace Fairness Act would require online retailers to collect and pay sales taxes to states even where they have no physical presence.

In 1992, the Supreme Court ruled that retailers can only collect taxes in states where they have a physical presence.

The internet sales tax proposal, which boasts bipartisan support, has gained momentum recently with a Senate hearing on Wednesday.

Amazon's vice president Paul Misener came out in support of the bill on Wednesday night as the world’s largest internet retailer gradually adds sales taxes across the nation.

Amazon is establishing a physical presence in more states by building warehouses. This physical presence means Amazon customers will be charged with sales tax regardless of whether new legislation is passed so the company has less reason to fight internet sales tax, as it used to. 

Texans have already starting paying it and, in September, Californian residents will also be taxed. By next year, ten states will be taxed, reported NBC.

Furthermore, because internet retailers will potentially have to spend time and resources complying to different state’s tax codes they may well rise the prices of goods to cover this extra work. 

Although consumers  presently do not pay a sales tax on online purchases they are meant to pay a ‘use tax’ later to the state.

However,
 hardly anyone knows about or pays this ‘use tax’, which is set at the 
same rate as the state’s sales tax, and it is rarely enforced.  

This
 ‘use tax’ means supporters of the proposal can argue that the 
legislation allows for collection of money the state is already owed.

The
 onus on paying the tax is transferred from the customer to the retailer
 where the businesses would have to file a tax return for every state 
they sell in and could be subject to audits in those states.
