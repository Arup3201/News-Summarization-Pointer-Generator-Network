Labour's health spokesman Andy Burnham was accused of ‘political posturing’ for calling for a halt to private companies running NHS services.

Mr Burnham backed Jarrow-style protest marches against the coalition's health reforms, claiming the 'privatisation’ of the health service is ‘indefensible’.

But his speech in Manchester came under fire because as health secretary in the last Labour government he extended the use of the private sector services.

Labour's shadow health secretary Andy Burnham backed protest marches against the involvement of private firms in the NHS, something he signed off when in government

Mr Burnham called for all pending NHS contracts with the private sector to be put on hold until the next election - except where there are ‘threats to on-going service provision’. 

But in office, he oversaw the process of private companies bidding to run Hinchingbrooke hospital in Cambridge. 

It is the first hospital to be run by a private firm, a model which Labour now say they oppose.

Mr Burnham said: 'When people look back, this could turn out to be no ordinary summer for the NHS.

'In just over two weeks, a group of mums from Darlington will set out from the North East, retracing the steps of the Jarrow marchers.

'The People’s March for the NHS aims to raise awareness about, in their words, “the Government’s assault on our most prized possession”.

'It remains to be seen whether it catches the public mood. But I think it might. There is growing anxiety about where the NHS is heading - and anger that people have never voted for such changes.'

The original Jarrow March in 1936 saw a band of jobless men walk 300 miles to London to protest about unemployment and poverty during the Great Depression. 

Mr Burnham said some of the private contracts currently proposed will last for five or ten years at least, which will ‘tie the hands of the next government’.

Spending on private providers, he says, has now exceeded £10billion. ‘When did the British public ever give their consent for this?’, he said.

‘The reason people love and trust the NHS is because for all its faults, it is a service that is based on people not profits’, he added.

‘It is indefensible for the character of the country’s most valued institution to be changed in this way without the public being given a say.’

But even the NHS Confederation – which presents all providers of health and care services - was sceptical.

Chief operating officer Matt Tee said: ‘The test should be what is right for patients and local communities. 

'Our members are very clear that there are plenty of things which keep them awake at night, but contracting is rarely cited as one of them.

He called for politicians of all parties ‘to engage with the real issues facing the health and social care system and to play their part in taking forward an honest debate with the public about how to address them.’

Conservatives pointed out Mr Burnham’s change of tune since his party’s 2010 manifesto in which Labour promised to allow foundation hospitals – which run their own finances – to have the freedom ‘to increase their private services where these are consistent with NHS values’.

A Conservative spokesman said: ‘Use of the private sector by the NHS doubled in the last four years of Labour, a far bigger increase than under this government.

‘Andy Burnham himself signed off the privatisation of Hinchingbrooke Hospital during Labour's final year so it is pure political posturing to try to interfere with doctors making the best clinical judgements for patients.

Yesterday Hazel Blears, a former minister under Tony Blair, wrote an article cautioning against making decisions about public services on the basis of ideology.

She wrote in Progress magazine that under New Labour: ‘The party adopted a more open-minded approach to the private sector, rightly determined to dispel notions it was anti-business.

‘But it also achieved fantastic improvements in the standard of public services, becoming the first government since the war to cut crime while achieving the lowest ever NHS waiting times.’

The Coalition have carried out a controversial £3billion reorganisation of the national health service which they say puts budgets back in the hands of doctors.

Critics say it allows too many vital services such as cancer care to be run for profit rather than for patients.

Mr Burnham pointed to two contracts for cancer care in Staffordshire – lasting 10 years with a combined value of £1.2bn; a five year contract for elderly care in Cambridge worth £800million, and a contract for services in Oxford and Milton Keynes which has been put up for ‘auction’ to the cheapest bidder.
