The father of Yessenia Suarez - the Florida woman who was murdered, allegedly along with her two children, by her husband last year - is now seeking to marry the sister of his daughter's killer.

And in a further disturbing twist, Emilio A. Suarez has asked his former son-in-law - who is in prison awaiting trial for his daughter's slaying - for his permission in the union.

Luis Toledo, 32, a known gang member, has admitted to killing his 28-year-old wife Yessenia with a single blow to the throat, however refused to tell police where her body is.

He has also been charged with killing his stepchildren, Thalia Otto, 9, and Michael Elijah Otto, 8, who were reported missing on October 23.

Their bodies have never been found.

Yessenia Suarez, 28, and her children, 
8-year-old Michael Otto and 9-year-old Thalia Otto were allegedly 
killed by Ms Suarez's husband, Louis Toledo. Ms Suarez's father has now asked Toledo if he may date Toledo's sister

Awaiting trial: Luis Toledo, 32, is charged with one count of second-degree murder in the slaying of his wife, Yessenia Suarez, 28, and two counts of first-degree murder in the killings of her children, Thalia Otto, 9, and Michael Elijah Otto, 8

Now Emilio Suarez, Yessenia's biological father, has written to Toledo in prison, asking if its ok for him to date Toledo's sister, who is called 'Millie' in the letters.

The Daytona Beach News Journal reports the almost-illegible letter was sent from an address in Tampa to the Volusia County Branch Jail where Toledo is being held without bail.

Suarez refers to Toledo as 'son'.

'… when I ask you for yor permition to date an problably marriet your sister.

'An that will be after we see if we match + we get alone perfectly good I will do anything possible to make her Happy and I hope she do the same for me.

'Well son enogh of loves stories. L.O.L.'

The letter goes on to assure Toledo he doesn't have to worry about how the family might react to Suarez dating his sister.

Luis Toledo was seen publicly threatening his wife before she and her children disappeared

'I know you will say what About my Family well, that’s something that I will have to deal with that,' Suarez wrote.

Suarez also uses the letter to beg Toledo to tell him where the bodies are, asking to 'let me bury them' but promising not to tell the police.

'I want the best for you. You know that, and I always will be there for you.

'cus you know I have Jesus in my Hart. And since Day one I told you I forgive you. Right remember. Did I ever screem at you or curs you out. never.'

Documents released earlier this year revealed that Toledo had found out his wife was having an affair with a co-worker, which motivated the murder.

Investigators interviewed Ms Suarez's lover who said that in the weeks leading up to her death, their intense

Toledo, a known gang member, was enraged, according to an affidavit seen by Fox.

The co-worker said that Toledo slapped his wife in the face while she pleaded with him to 'think of the kids'.

Ms Suarez's lover said that he last spoke to her at 1am on the day she disappeared.

He said she apologized to him, saying that he had nothing to worry about - and she was the one who would have to look over her shoulder.

The following day, police went to check on the family after her mother called to report that she was unable to get through to her daughter.

Toledo arrived at the home and told authorities that he had slept in the car following an argument and had returned to find his wife and the children missing, police said.

Toledo has denied killing Otto and Thalia but the State Attorney's Office says it has enough forensic evidence to make a case

Toledo was initially arrested on a domestic battery charge.

However a neighbor told police that Toledo had asked for help dropping off his wife's car at 6am on Wednesday and they took it to Lake Mary.

Police added that a search of the couple's home also revealed blood.

Toledo faces two counts of first-degree murder over the deaths of his stepchildren and a second-degree murder charge for Ms Suarez.

Toledo, who is trained in martial arts, confessed to killing Ms Suarez with a single deadly blow to her throat after confronting her over messages on her phone from another man.

He has denied killing the children saying that their murders were carried out by an accomplice.

The State Attorney's Office says it has enough forensic evidence to make a case against Toledo.

He has a pre-trial hearing set for September 16 and a tentative trial date of October 13.
