A virtually unseen Paul Cezanne painting owned by Henry Ford's son Edsel has sold for a high of $100 million.

The early 20th century oil work titled La Montagne Sainte-Victoire vue du bosquet du Château Noir, which depicts a mountain range in the south of France, was snapped up by a private collector who chose not to be named.

It was part a private collection at the former residence of Edsel Ford and his wife Eleanor in Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan, which now operates as a non-profit museum.

Going, going, gone: This virtually unseen Paul Cezanne painting titled La Montagne Sainte-Victoire vue du bosquet du Château Noir, owned by Henry Ford's son Edsel, has sold for a high of $100 million

According to The Detroit News, tax forms listing the sale show the couple originally bought the painting for $242,000. 

It has reportedly only appeared publicly outside the Ford House twice in the past 60 years - once at a 1978 exhibition in Paris and later in a 1990 show in Edinburgh, Scotland.

Edsel & Eleanor Ford House president, Kathleen Mullins,  told the Detroit Free Press that the board of trustees received an unsolicited offer for the painting in mid-2013 but turned it down.

However, the buyer came back with other proposals and the Ford House's board, which includes Ford descendants and the family's lawyer, gave the idea more consideration.

'This was really a once-in-a-lifetime offer,' Mullins said. 

'The family thought it was a way to guarantee the estate would be taken care of the way Eleanor would have wanted.'

Eleanor Ford, who died in 1976 - 33 years after her husband - wanted their property be used for 'the benefit of the public'.

Mullins said the Cezanne sale was done within the legal terms of Eleanor's will and the board is not selling more art. 

The buyer of the Cezanne painting also reportedly wanted a watercolor by the French artist in the Ford collection but the board said no.

The 2013 La Montagne Sainte-Victoire vue du bosquet du Château Noir deal was kept secret to help protect Detroit-owned artworks under threat during the city's bankruptcy trial.

In the end, a $800 million promise from foundations, major corporations and the state helped protect art from possible sale.

The Ford House, which is on solid financial footing and carries no debt, is using proceeds from the sale to create a special endowment for preservation, conservation and restoration. 

It includes the 87-acre estate of auto industry pioneer Henry Ford's only son on the shores of Lake St. Clair as well as furnishings and objects inside the mansion.

The cultural institute, which draws about 60,000 visitors a year for tours and events, has a separate operating endowment of $86 million.
