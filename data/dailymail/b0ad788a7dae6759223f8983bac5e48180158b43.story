This is the view across the Pennines to be savoured should you be lucky enough to scale the heights of the tallest free-standing structure in the United Kingdom, the Emley Moor Transmitting Station, near Kirklees in West Yorkshire.

The 1,084ft tower is the fourth tallest tower in the European Union and world's 23rd tallest tower at 70ft taller than London's 1,014ft Shard skyscraper. 

At 493ft taller than the capital's 591ft Gherkin, 21ft higher than the Eiffel Tower and more than six times taller than Trafalgar Square's Nelson's Column, the concrete structure hides in plain sight as one of Britain's best kept secrets, believes site manager Paul French.

'It's probably one of the best kept secrets around,' says French, 54. 'Most people I tell seem to think that the Shard in London is the tallest (in Britain), but I'm sure a lot of people definitely don't know that it is in fact Emley Moor.'

It takes a full eight minutes to take the elevator from the bottom to the top in a journey not for those squeamish about heights and on a clear day it is said you can see for 40 miles.

Far from a mere view point, more than 1.5million people rely on the mast at its top to beam hundreds of channels of digital television to them from Greater Manchester 40 miles away to Scarborough on the east coast.

The TV mast, known officially as The Arqiva Tower, can be seen for miles and features a control room at 892 feet with a stunning view across the Pennines. 

'I'm not scared of heights but there is a trap door at the top that has just fresh air underneath so that is a cause for concern,' says French, who has worked at Emley Moor for 32 years.

French, 54, who has worked there for 32 years, works at the helm of the tower that deliver more than 1.5million people their digital TV signals

The original 450ft tower was erected in 1956 and entered service for ITV on November 3 that year, before it was replaced by a 1,265ft version in 1964.

But on March 19, 1969, the building spectacularly collapsed under the weight of ice and high winds, leaving debris strewn across fields and knocking out TV service for millions of viewers. 

After years of temporary masts, work on the new tower that now stands, began later that year and was completed in 1970.

Paul said: 'We didn't have a colour television at the time but I remember we lost ITV for four days.

Under the weight of ice and high winds, millions lost their TV service - work on the tower as it now stands began later that year

'The old tower effectively caved in on itself so it was a miracle that no one was injured.

'In fact, the only thing that happened was that a guide rope slashed through the nearby Methodist church and gave a fellow practicing on the organ a bit of a fright.' 

Emley Moor is dwarfed by Tokyo Skytree, which stands 2,080ft and took over the Canton Tower as the world's tallest tower in 2011. 

It stands only behind the 2,722ft Burj Khalifa as the second tallest building in the world. But none of them boast such stunning country views.
