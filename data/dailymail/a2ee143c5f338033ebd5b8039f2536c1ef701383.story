Tourists spend thousands of pounds going on skiing holidays every year, but there is always the temptation to spend a day or two off the slopes – and these stunning chalets show exactly why that is.

With bubbling hot tubs, Champagne receptions and roaring fires, these beautiful properties are reason enough to journey to forget Christmas in rainy Britain and jet off to the French Alps.

Set in deep snow, these chalets – rating among the best in the region – offer a cosy refuge from the cold outdoors.

Holiday luxury: What better place to warm up than this bubbling hot tub at Chalet Twenty26 in Morzine. And for when you want to dry off, there's a Canadian sauna room

Sky high: People spend thousands of pounds every year travelling to the French Alps for a week or two of skiing

Lounging around: Often, though, the chalet accommodation can be the highlight of a trip to the region

Chalet Twenty26 in the Haute Savoie resort of Morzine has one of the most tempting offers – a hot tub set on a balcony with a Canadian sauna behind to dry off.

The property also has a comfortable living area inside, with logs stacked high for the roaring fire.

Further up the hill is Chalet Amuse Bouche, which offers spectacular views across the Morzine resort in addition to a stunning dining area and warm, cosy bedrooms.

Splashing around: After a difficult day on the slopes, guests at Chaletneuf du Tenne can unwind in this pretty indoor swimming pool

Home from home: The luxury chalet costs 850 euros per person per week, or it can be rented as a whole - sleeping 12 people - for 10,000 euros over seven days

Forrest: Set just below a forest, the beautiful wooden chalet is an easy distance from the ski slopes of Chatel

Reflection: The chalet's swimming pool lies in the shadow of the stunning French alps out of the window

Away from Morzine, Chaletneuf du Tenne, which has a beautiful living and dining area, is conveniently placed for the slopes of Chatel.

The property, situated between the village and Alpine forest above also has a beautiful swimming pool that guests can climb into after a long day on the slopes.

But it’s not all about appearance when it comes to choosing a chalet.

Some of the catered properties in the French Alps offer the type of food that could make a holiday complete on its own.

Perfect for a party: This is the scene that will await visitors to Chalet Bartavellem just outside the farming village of Meribel, in the Savoie area of France

The cosy chalet, which you can ski to the door of straight from a red run on the slopes, offers spectacular views and and down the mountain

In addition to its good access to the slopes, guests at Chalet Bartraville are also told to expect 'bountiful breakfasts, homemade cakes, canapés before dinner, and delicious aromas at table'

The conveniently-located chalet costs 525 euros per person per week, or 4,200 for the whole residence, which can sleep eight

Another option for food is Maison Lennox, in Macot la Plagne, which promises four-course meals after your day on the slopes.

While the chalet is set a fair distance down from the slopes, it is in easy reach of slopes at La Plagne and Paradiski.

With two bedrooms, the property, which is run by a couple from London, costs 473 euros a week

Inside the comfortable chalet, visitors are offered elaborate four-course meals after a long day's skiing

The downside to a lot of these properties is the price - with some costing as much as 5,000 euros (more than £4,000) for a week.

And with skiing prices added, it can often be worth settling for a hotel offering similar facilities.

Over the Italian border, Hotel Bellevue, in the Aosta Valley, is a short distance from the slopes above and can cost as little as 90 euros (£75) per night per person.
