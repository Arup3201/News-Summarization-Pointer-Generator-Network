Tony Blair’s friendship with Wendi Deng is set to light up the West End when a satirical new play about Rupert Murdoch opens later this year. 

The stage show Rupert will chart the 82-year-old press baron’s career in cabaret style, covering his turbulent private life, his proximity to powerful politicians and the toxic fallout from the newspaper hacking scandal. 

British producers have signed a deal to turn the Australian play, which had a sell-out run in  Melbourne last year, into a UK hit – and promise that it will be ‘updated to take account of recent events’.

Key players: Details of the feud between Murdoch, Deng and Blair revealed by Mail on Sunday will hit the stage

It means the writers have licence to feature the sensational revelations by The Mail on Sunday that the mogul had discovered that his wife had spent weekends with Mr Blair at Mr Murdoch’s homes. 

Their closeness brought problems in the 14-year Murdoch marriage to a head and causing a ‘terminal rift’ between the two men.

Mr Blair denies that he had an affair with Ms Deng.

Rupert, created by award-winning playwright David Williamson, tells Mr Murdoch’s life story in his ‘own words’, including via supposed messages sent by the Twitter-savvy octogenarian. 

In the version seen by Australian audiences Ms Deng, played by HaiHa Le, is at one point seen  pouting on all fours, dressed in a miniskirt, in what one critic described as ‘a jaw-dropping orientalist portrayal’.

Mr Blair appeared fleetingly as a caricature in the Australian version of the play, which ran before news broke of the Blair-Deng friendship, but there was no mention of his closeness to 45-year-old Ms Deng.

Script: The British producers developing the Australian play are seeking legal advice as they reconstruct the relationships in the media mogul's life, based on allegations revealed last year about the former Prime Minister

The producers – who say they are taking careful legal advice on how to update the play for British audiences – have plenty of new material they could introduce about the former Prime Minister. 

Our revelations included the discovery of a note written by Ms Deng to herself in which she said she had a ‘crush’ on Mr Blair, and the fact that they met on a superyacht owned by music billionaire David Geffen without Mr Murdoch’s knowledge. Mr Murdoch, who divorced Ms Deng four months ago, could be shown ‘raging’ at the news of the friendship.

The producers could also highlight Mr Blair’s presence at the baptism of the Murdochs’ daughter, Grace, on the banks of the River Jordan in 2010: Mr Blair, who was dressed in flowing white robes for the ceremony, is the girl’s godfather.

Two different actors will play  ‘junior Rupert’ and ‘senior Rupert’, who interact together on the stage.

According to one West End agent, Sir Ian Mckellen or David Morrissey could be approached to play  Mr Murdoch at the different stages of his life, while Michael Sheen could reprise his Tony Blair impersonation.

Last night, Daniel Sparrow, the producer who has secured the rights to mount the production in the UK, said that the script would be ‘localised’ with ‘some more UK specific plot points’.

Asked if he would be updating the play to include the Blair-Deng relationship, Mr Sparrow said: ‘My solicitors are advising on these aspects, so I cannot confirm which plot points we are considering.

‘It is too soon to speculate what updates will or won’t be incorporated, especially related to Blair, or on the casting.

‘We need to act upon the advice of our lawyers. We will address such updates later on in the production process.’

‘I am confident that UK audiences will find David Williamson’s new play fast-paced, humorous, enlightening and a wholly riveting evening of theatrical entertainment.’

The play will also cover the Murdoch family’s in-fighting, the arguments over whether he exerts undue influence over politicians and the reverberations from the phone- hacking scandal at his now-defunct News of the World.
