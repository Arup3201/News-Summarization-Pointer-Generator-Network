Zoran Pokusevski, pictured, only received five replies from British people when he advertised for workers for his new deli 

Opening a delicatessen in a jobless blackspot might have been expected to generate a flood of applications from locals eager to snap up the ten posts on offer.

But Zoran Pokusevski was shocked by the response when he advertised for staff for his venture near the BBC’s gleaming northern complex in Salford.

The jobless rate is nearly one-and-a-half times the national average – but only five out of the 70 hopefuls with the right skills were British. The remainder were immigrants from Eastern Europe or Spain.

Out of the British candidates, only two turned up for an interview to be rewarded with jobs where they will be paid £8-an-hour plus tips.

The extraordinary statistic will add to fears that unemployed Britons who are used to life on benefits cannot match the work ethic of new arrivals.

Mr Pokusevski is expanding from his original well-received branch in the relatively prosperous Stockport suburb of Heaton Moor. Although he has a PhD in chemical engineering, the 42-year-old Serbian set up a deli in 2003 after coming to Britain in the 1990s following the Balkans conflict.

Yesterday Mr Pokusevski told of his surprise that so few locals had applied for his jobs. His experience showed why many employers felt they could not manage without foreign labour, he added

‘I feel if you put a stop to immigration, you might struggle because it simply didn’t happen,’ he said on a BBC Radio 5 Live discussion on immigration. ‘English people didn’t want to work. In my view it’s just supply and demand.’

Last month, the Daily Mail asked: ‘Is there no-one left in Britain who can make a sandwich?’

This followed the revelation that Greencore Group, which supplies major supermarkets, was looking in Hungary to fill 300 posts at its new Northampton factory as too few Britons would do the job.

Mr Pokusevski told the Mail that he would have preferred to have more local staff at his new deli.

‘For front of house, it’s actually an advantage to me if people are British because they’re better at communicating with customers.

‘But the people who applied were predominantly Polish, with quite a few Spanish and other nationalities like Slovakian, and hardly any English,’ he said.

Mr Pokusevski said he only invited those with relevant experience for interview although the positions included low-skill posts such as three kitchen porters.

‘It tends to be mainly foreign nationals who apply for jobs across the catering industry – I suppose they have no choice – but I’m paying well above minimum wage with tips on top,’ he added.

‘I’m very pleased with the staff I’ve recruited. They’ve got a good work ethic, they’re never late and they’re very hard-working. We’re a happy European family!’

All the staff at his first delicatessen are local British workers although the area has much lower unemployment.

For his Salford venture, Mr Pokusevski advertised on recruitment websites, mainly attracting foreign nationals living in the area.

In future, he plans to use local job creation initiatives in the hope of attracting a broader range of applicants.

His latest project is perfectly placed to attract custom from the high-rise MediaCity complex, now the base of BBC Breakfast and Radio 5 Live as well as Granada TV and Coronation Street.

According to the most recent figures, 11,900 people were unemployed in Salford in the year to last June, a rate of 10.1 per cent compared to 6.8 per cent nationally.

Across North-West England, only Liverpool, Rochdale and Burnley had a higher unemployment rate.

Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith has claimed that the last Labour Government’s ‘open-door’ policy led to a huge influx of low-skilled migrant workers while its welfare system discouraged Britons from working.
