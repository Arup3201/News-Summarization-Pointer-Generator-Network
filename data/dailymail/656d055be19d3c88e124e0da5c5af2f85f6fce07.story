Vadim Andreev says he can give any woman a cover girl transformation by simply using cosmetics.

The 29-year-old beauty guru from Saint Petersburg enhances features and covers blemishes in  a bid to make his subjects more beautiful and proves his amazing skill with striking before-and-after photographs.

Russian make-up artist Vadim Andreev says he can give any woman a cover girl transformation by simply using cosmetics

He says women should use under eye concealer, blush on the cheek, and highlighter on cheekbone

Vadim has been working as a make-up artist since he was 16 years old and quickly established his reputation to become a stylist to the stars.

'It was my hobby. I really loved to transform people ever since I was I 
child,' he tells MailOnline.

'When I grew up I decided to go into professional make-up and 
hair styling.'

Vadim has worked on Russian TV shows and lists various Russian celebrities as clients, from models and actresses to popstars.

He also works with 'every day' women, charging for make-overs for special occasions and weddings, and charts some of their transformations with before-and-after looks on his website vadimandreev.com

He's also happy to pass on some of 
his make-up wizardry by running his own make-up workshops and 
masterclasses and how-to videos.

'I started taking these photos to show people they can 
change, be more attractive, look and feel happier,' he says.

He
 doesn't just work with women, but also gives make-overs to men who 
might want a gothic or punk look - or simply to make their skin look
 clearer.

Vadim said his aim was to show that anyone could look like a flawless celebrity with the right time and know-how.

He admits that a few of his professional after photos have a little bit of post-production, like erasing hair on forehead or colour correction, perhaps slight contrast enhancement or sharpening. But most of them are entirely natural.

'[The photos] don't mean women should do heavy make-up all the time. There are little make-up secrets 
for everyday. Everybody can use them,' he says.

Vadim believes that every common girl can become a glamorous celebrity

'My secret is in the eye, I guess. I can see the 
beauty inside each person and show it to everybody.

'My top tips for the everyday woman are: use a light under-eye concealer, cream blush on the top of your cheek, 
and highlight on cheekbones.

'Put some bronzer under your cheekbones and along the 
chin and blend well over the face.

'Put some black mascara on your lashes
 and apply warm pink lipgloss on lips. This will give you fresh, young 
look.

'Recently, we did
 a great makeover for a friend of mine. She lives in a small town and 
is kind of old fashioned. She had a terrible fringe which didn't suit 
her. I opened her forehead, put in some hair extensions, tweezed her eyebrows, 
did her make-up - and she obviously became like a celebrity. She was very happy 
and didn't remove the make-up for three days.'

A bit of fake tan, fancy eyeshadow, and Vadim's magic transforms a woman completely

He said: 'Make-up is a very personal and individual process. I believe that every common girl can become a glamorous celebrity. I want to help everyone to see their own beauty, just sometimes it takes a little bit more time and a bit of a helping hand.'

'I have a lot of plans and dreams about my future in 
make-up, such as writing a book and have my own TV show about makeovers.

'And, of course, my usual work with lovely brides, giving workshops and 
masterclasses.'

Using just make-up, Vadim transforms plain women into Hollywood stars with perfect skin and features
