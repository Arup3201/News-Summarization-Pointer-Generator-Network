With a little help from a California woman, Mattel - the toy company behind iconic dolls like Barbie and Polly Pocket - has agreed to begin manufacturing more 'Ella' dolls, which are designed for kids going through chemotherapy.

The therapy dolls don't have hair, but come with a number of wigs, and are designed to help young kids cope with losing their hair as a result of their treatment.

Grace Bumstead, 4, suffers from a form of leukemia so rare that its rate among children is one in a million.

While she was in treatment, Grace got an 'Ella' doll, which her mother says has now joined the girl's 'inner-circle of Barbies.'

'When they first met, she’s like, "OK, I get what’s going on." But it 
gave us the chance to say, "Here’s a beautiful, smiling doll. It doesn’t
 have hair,’” her mother, Melissa Bumstead, told CBSLA.com.

At such a young age, Grace will be forced to endure intensive chemotherapy over the next 18 months. The treatment already has caused the young girl to lose her blond curls.

'She’s been amazingly brave. And we’re very, very proud of her. It’s not
 where we expected to be in life right now,' Bumstead said. 'We bring [Ella] along everywhere to say, "This is what’s happening. 
This is what’s happened to Ella. This is what’s gonna happen to you." It
 brought it to her level.'

Impressed with how much the doll helped her daughter, Bumstead discovered that the hospital where Grace was being treated had just six dolls to give to other girls facing chemotherapy.

Bumstead took it upon herself to publicly let the toy giant Mattel know that they need to make more 'Ella' dolls by starting an online petition urging Mattel to manufacture more of the special dolls.

After just three months, the petition had more than 100,000 signatures.

'Every 10 minutes, we had 1,000 signatures,' Bumstead said.

When Mattell got word of the petition, it agreed to make more of the dolls and distribute them to hospitals across the country.

'If the pain that we’re going through right now can help someone else, it makes it feel like it’s worth it,' Bumstead tells the station.

Grace's doctors say she has a 75 percent chance that she will be cured of her rare disease.

'The big issue is psychosocial. How will she view herself? How will she 
view the world when she grows up? Will she be afraid of the whole world 
because she thinks that leukemia will come back at any minute and end 
her life?' Dr. Paul Gaynon said.

Mattel reportedly told the Bumstead family that they hope to begin distributing the 'Ella' dolls by August. The company says the plan is to make a new version of the doll every year.
