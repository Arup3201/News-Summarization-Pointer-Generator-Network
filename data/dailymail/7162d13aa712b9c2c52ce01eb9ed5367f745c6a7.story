Andy Murray has been honoured as the Arthur Ashe Humanitarian of the Year in the 2014 ATP World Tour Awards.

The British No 1 has been recognised for his fundraising efforts for cancer research and his charity work for UNICEF, United for Wildlife and Malaria No More.

Murray helped to organise the 2013 Rally Against Cancer event at London’s Queen’s Club after his friend Ross Hutchins was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma and he also took part in this year’s Rally For Bally in memory of Elena Baltacha, who died from liver cancer in May.
