The RSPCA are appealing for witnesses after a cat was found with an arrow lodged in its back.

Tiggar, a two-and-a-half year old male, was found yesterday morning by resident in Armadale, south east Perth. 

The animal is lucky to be alive and is expected to make a full recovery, with the arrow missing all of his vital organs.

RSPCA WA Chief Inspector Amanda Swift said 'Tiggar was found yesterday morning by a local resident with an arrow lodged in his back.' 

'It is appalling that any person can deliberately hurt an animal and we are very concerned with the recent acts of cruelty we have seen towards cats.'

After being spotted near the intersection of Armadale Road and Seventh Road, Tigar was taken to Foothills Animal Hospital, where veterinarians could remove the arrow and treat the wounds. 

Ms Swift said there is a string of similar incidents in the region of late.

'In the last two weeks there has been two cats thrown from vehicles and now Tiggar shot with an arrow.'

'People who live in this area should watch their pets and remain vigilant as we don't want this happening to other animals,' she said.

Foothills Animal Hospital will continue to treat Tiggar and provide his ongoing care. They will also find him a new home and already have had interest from people wanting to adopt him.

Anyone who witnessed this incident or has information is asked to contact the RSPCA WA on 1300 CRUELTY
