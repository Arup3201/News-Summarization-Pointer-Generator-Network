Thirteen-year-old Lauren Nevil was in court last week to confront the drunk driver who killed her mother and left her severely injured in a car crash last Thanksgiving.

On Tuesday, 36-year-old John David Coe of Prescott, Arkansas was sentenced to more than 40 years in Arkansas State Prison after pleading guilty last week on all eight charges in relation to the crash that killed 38-year-old mother Katy Nevil.

During the hearing last week,  Lauren finally got the opportunity to speak to her mother's killer.

'You have ruined my life forever, do you realize that?' the teenager asked. 'Now I will have to live my life without a mom.'

The driver: 36-year-old John David Coe had twice the legal amount of alcohol in his system when he caused the Nevil family's car to crash around last Thanksgiving

'Maybe he [God] one day will forgive you, and you can go to heaven, where you forced my mom to be today. May God show you the right path to lead you on,' Lauren added.

Last November 16, Mrs Nevil, her husband Steve, and their son Will and daughter Lauren were driving from their home in Franklin, Tennessee to spend Thanksgiving with family in Texas.

Originally they planned to spend the night in Texarcana, but changed their minds and decided to drive straight through to Texas.

On a dark stretch of Interstate 30 near Hope, Arkansas, Coe came barreling down the road and hit the Nevil's car, hurling it off the road.

At the time, Coe had more than twice the legal limit of alcohol in his system while driving his daughters Gracie, 9, and Chloe, 12.

After the crash and her mother's death, Lauren spent 161 days in the hospital recovering from her very serious injuries.

She suffered a broken femur, collapsed lung, three broken ribs, a mutilated right foot and a traumatic brain injury.

Driving dangerously: Coe clipped the Nevil's car causing it to hurl off the road. Coe had twice the legal limit of alcohol in his system at the time as well as his two young daughters in the car

Injured: Katy Nevil was killed in the crash, and Lauren was severely injured. She suffered a broken femur, collapsed lung, three broken ribs, a mutilated right foot, and a traumatic brain injury. On the right, a picture of Lauren's attempt to write her name after the accident

Guilty: John David Coe, pictured in court last week, has contributed $100,000 to Lauren Nevil's health fund

Last week Coe plead guilty to eight charges including negligent homicide, first-degree battery, aggravated assault, aggravated assault on family or household members, possession of a controlled substance of less than four ounces of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia.

He was sentenced to the maximum for each sentence, and will not be eligible for parole until he has served 10 years in prison.

At the hearing last week, Mrs Nevils' husband and brother also got the opportunity to speak.

Taken away: Mrs Nevil's brother and husband got the opportunity to speak at last week's hearing as well

Contribution: Coe donated $100,000 to Lauren Nevil's medical fund but it will not have an impact on his sentencing or prohibit the family from filing a civil suit against him

'You and only you are responsible for the death of a true angel,' Mrs Nevil's brother Jimmy Brimson said. 'And let's get one thing straight: No matter what the plea was, you murdered my sister. The effect of that action has shattered my life, as you took away my best friend and my rock.'

Husband Steve Nevil read his wife's eulogy to her killer.

'My soul mate, love of my life, spouse, best friend and mother of our children's heart does not physically beat any longer because of your selfish and preventable choice you made on 11/16/12.' 

'My heart literally feels as though 
it is broken in half,' Mr Nevil said. 'It's a feeling that you simply 
can't understand unless you experience yourself. I wish I could bottle 
it up and allow you to feel it for just one second so you can truly 
understand and possibly be properly remorseful.'

Heart broken: Mrs Nevil's husband Steve also spoke at the hearing last week, saying that his heart 'literally feels as though it is broken in half'
