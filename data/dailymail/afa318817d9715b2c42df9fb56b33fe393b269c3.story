NFL star Tom Brady worried Patriots Nation and probably caused Bill Belichick to spit out his morning coffee on Saturday after he posted a video of himself jumping off a giant cliff.  

The 37-year-old, who was with Gisele Bundchen when he made the leap, shared the video on Facebook along with the message: 'Never doing that again! #AirBrady'.

After the 15-year veteran shared the video on Facebook in the morning, video of him playing basketball with NBA legend Michael Jordan began to emerge on social media during the afternoon.

After Brady posted the video of the dive onto his Facebook page, he indicated it might be his last big jump 

Brady and his family were recently in Costa Rica on a family holiday, NESN reported. 

The pickup basketball game, which also featured golfer Keegan Bradley, took place in the Bahamas, according to FanSided. 

Jordan, who won six NBA titles over the course of his career and is now the  majority owner of the Charlotte Hornets, can be heard talking trash during the video clip of the pickup game.

Before he was seen on the cliff or in the Bahamas, Brady hit the beach with Bundchen and their kids 

The three professionals also played golf together at some point, as shown in a photo Bradley posted on Instagram. 

Brady is taking a well-earned break after guiding New England to a thrilling Super Bowl victory over the Seattle Seahawks in Glendale, Arizona last month.

The 28-24 victory over Seattle at the University of Phoenix Stadium on February 1 clinched an elusive fourth Super Bowl ring for Brady, a decade after he won his third.

The four-time Super Bowl winning quarterback has earned nearly $150million in salary alone over the course of his career, according to Spotrac.  

If Brady wins another title, he will be the only quarterback in history with five Super Bowl wins. 

He would have to win the big game two more times to equal Jordan's six.  

Jordan, 52, earned about $94million in salary during his 16 seasons in the National Basketball Association 

Bundchen and daughter Vivian rocked their two-piece bikinis for the beach trip on the clear and sunny day

The win in Glendale, Arizona, was Brady's fourth Super Bowl title and it might not be his last
