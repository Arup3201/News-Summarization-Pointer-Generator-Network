A four-year-old boy with cerebral palsy has enjoyed a ride on his bicycle for the first time after his parents raised £45,000 for him to undergo a life-changing operation available only in the U.S.

Just weeks ago, Ross Kerr could never have dreamed of playing so energetically as his movement was restricted after a stroke in the womb.

In 2010, he was diagnosed with hemiplegic cerebral palsy, which caused motor neuron damage to the left side of his brain affecting his movement.

In the saddle: Ross Kerr, pictured with his mother Naomi Miller, was diagnosed with hemiplegic cerebral palsy two years ago. His parents raised £45,000 for him to undergo a life-changing operation available only in the U.S.

While temporary treatments to help his walking were available in Britain, his parents Naomi Miller and Ross Kerr hoped an operation only available in the U.S. would change his life.

They launched a fund-raising drive in February so Ross Jr could undergo selective dorsal rhizotomy surgery to improve his walking and perhaps even enable him to kick a football.

After two operations Ross, from Baillieston, Glasgow, is now back home and beginning to enjoy playing like any other child.

His mother is still amazed by how far the youngster has come in such a short time.

Miss Miller, 22, said: 'Ross pedaled towards me on a bike for the first time - and I knew it had all been worthwhile.

'To see him do what other children take for granted was a special moment.

'There were times when I thought we were never going to make it, but to see Ross today thank goodness we did.

'It has already changed our lives. Ross is now out playing and running about. He is beginning to do new things every day.

'For months we ran car boot sales and bag-packed at supermarkets - it became our whole life.'

It took the family five months to reach its target of £45,000.

They then headed to St Louis Children’s Hospital in Missouri.

Road to recovery: After two operations Ross, from Baillieston, Glasgow, is now back home and beginning to enjoy playing like any other child

A three-hour operation to help flatten Ross’s right foot was carried out on July 12.

Miss Miller said: 'It was an anxious time when Ross was going through the operation. But after more than three hours, Ross was in recovery.

'We were given hourly updates by phone from theatre to tell us how things were going. 

'More than three hours later doctors told us everything went OK and Ross was being taken to recovery.

'Then came the hard part of keeping him lying flat for five days. He wasn’t allowed out of bed or to sit up.'

On day five, Ross was allowed to sit in a chair and was taken round the hospital garden in a wheelchair.

Miss Miller said: 'We were waiting to see when Ross would be allowed to walk. Physios decided it was time for him to stand on the sixth day.

'He got out of his chair and with no support stood up straight and from that day on has gone from strength to strength.

'Doctors decided Ross had to have a second operation to lengthen his heel chord, which cost more than £7,000. It gave him a lot better movement and has helped his progress.

'We were frantically getting relatives to fundraise all over again back home and we made it.

'We were contacted by the Arygle Tavern in Baillieston, whose customers raised £3,000. We could never have done any of this without people’s amazing generosity.'

Ross now requires two weeks of intensive physio and has to wear a foot support for several weeks, but after that he shouldn’t need more than regular physio sessions.

His mother said: 'If he hadn’t had the operation he would have had a lifetime of splints and botox therapy for his muscles. Now he has a real chance at the future he deserves.'
