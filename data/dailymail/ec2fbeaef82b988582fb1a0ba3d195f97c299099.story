Steve Bruce has brought an end to the uncertainty surrounding his future at Hull City after agreeing a new three-year deal.

The Tigers boss was previously on a rolling 12-month contract at the KC Stadium - meaning he always had one year to run – but he will now put pen to paper on a long-term extension.

Bruce had been linked with the recent vacancies at Newcastle and Fulham.

Indeed, Sportsmail understands the former Manchester United defender was interested in the position at St James’ Park, while he was sounded out by Niall Quinn regarding the post at Craven Cottage.

Bruce, though, has chosen to remain on Humberside.

He said: ‘We have achieved a lot in the few years we have been here but this is just the beginning of the journey.

‘Premier League survival is now crucial for us at this time, as is improving our training facility as we look to continue to grow and become a solid, well-run Premier League club.’

Bruce took charge of Hull in the summer of 2012 and won promotion to the top-flight in his first season. 

They survived and made it to the final of the FA Cup last time around and are currently five points clear of the relegation zone.
