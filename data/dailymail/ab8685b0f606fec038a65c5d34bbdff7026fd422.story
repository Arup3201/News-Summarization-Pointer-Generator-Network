£600m Deadline Day trolley dash

Gareth Bale completes world record move to Real

The evolution of the world record transfer

Club by club guide to all the transfers

When the window closes across Europe

As we enter the final hour of transfer deadline day, managers up and down the country are desperately trying to add to their squads in the dying minutes.

David Moyes still hasn't added to Manchester United's squad with a deal for Everton's Marouane Fellaini up in the air - and their move for Ander Herrera on the brink of collapse.

The future of Chelsea striker Romelu Lukaku is also unclear.

Sportsmail's team of reporters are working deep into the night to bring you all the deals as they are completed before the 11pm deadline.

23.05 MAROUANE FELLAINI IS A MANCHESTER UNITED PLAYER!

23.00 THE TRANSFER DEADLINE IS OVER! Of course, deals will still trickle through as only the paperwork had to be submitted before the deadline, but by and large that is it.

For me, it all hangs on Everton. They may well have sealed a deal for James McCarthy, leaving Marouane Fellaini to complete a switch to Manchester United.

The Toffees also

22.59 Adam Crafton: Everton have finally agreed a £13million deal with Wigan for James McCarthy.

Dave Whelan broadcasted his dissatisfaction with Everton's opening offer of £10.5million this evening on Sky and BBC to eek out that extra couple of million. Shrewd cookie.

As Sportsmail reported this morning, the business of Manchester United, Wigan and Everton is inextricably linked and the chain reaction now looks set to come off.

Step Up: Everton have agreed a fee for Wigan's James McCarthy

With McCarthy (and Gareth Barry) to Everton - and Nick Powell leaving United on loan to Wigan - logic would say that Manchester United must be forcing through the signing of Fellaini. READ MORE

22.54 And we've got confirmation that Ozil wear No 11 at the Emirates... while new team-mate Jack Wilshere is pleased with his fellow midfielder:

He tweeted: 'Signing of the summer! Easily! Fantastic player, plays the 'Arsenal way'. Welcome @MesutOzil1088 absolutely buzzing!'

22.53 Seven minutes left... David Moyes STILL hasn't sealed a move for Marouane Fellaini OR Ander Herrera.

Hair today: Marouane Fellaini still hasn't sealed his move to Manchester United

22.50 Real Madrid have tweeted about the Ozil deal, which if you kept glued to Sportsmail you knew was done and dusted hours ago:

'Real Madrid C.F. and Arsenal FC have reached an
agreement for the transfer of the player Mesut Özil to the English club.'

22.44 SHANE LONG LATEST from Colin Young:

The deal for Shane Long is on the verge of being done. He has just arrived at Hull’s training ground with Steve Bruce to complete his move from West Brom.

The Ireland international is now signing forms after agreeing terms and passing his medical at a hospital in Leeds.

Premier switch: West Brom's Shane Long is on his way to sealing a switch to Hull City

22.40 Some quotes from Arsenal's record signing Mesut Ozil 

Sportsmail reported three hours ago that Mesut Ozil had completed his £42.5m move to Arsenal from Real Madrid, and the Germany midfielder has spoken about his ambitions for the north London side.

Ozil said on Monday night: 'I look with pride on three wonderful years at Real Madrid, in which I've developed athletically and as a person.

'We won three titles and I was a regular, but now I look forward to my future in the Premier League with Arsenal.

'In talking with Arsene Wenger, I immediately sensed what had been missing, the wholly-hearted trust in me. I will pay back the club and the fans in each game. Now I want to help the club to finally win a title.' Read more here

22.33 HERRERA LATEST! Sportsmail's Joe Bernstein: Manchester United trying to explain why Herrera deal from Atletico Bilbao has broken down.

A senior source has told Mail Online: 'We really liked the player but thought the buy-out was the wrong valuation and were trying to do a deal. Still like the player'

Celebration: But Ander Herrera's move to Manchester United is on the brink of collapse

22.29 Sportsmail's Neil Moxley has revealed that Chelsea's Romelu Lukaku is heading on loan to Everton until the end of the season.

That will come as a blow to his former club West Brom, who had also hoped to seal a late temporary move for the Blues striker.

22.24 SIGNING! WEST BROM break their transfer record by signing Stephane Sessegnon from Sunderland for £6million. Two in, one out for the Mackems in the last twenty minutes!

The new man has Tweeted: 'Delighted to have signed for @WBAFCofficial , a dream move for me.. I now concentrate and hope to impress you all.'

All smiles: Stephane Sessegnon signs for West Bromwich Albion from Sunderland for a club record fee

22.22 SIGNING - ANOTHER SUNDERLAND ONE!

Andre Dossena has become Sunderland’s second Italian signing
of the day, arriving from Napoli on a one-year deal.

The left-back, previously of Liverpool, helped the Serie A
side to second place in their domestic league last year. Read more

22.15 HUGE news for Manchester United in that their £30.5m move
for Ander Herrera is on the brink of collapsing after the club have become
unhappy with terms of the deal. Stay tuned on this one though - there is still
much more to emerge on this particular transfer saga.

22:08 FELLAINI LATEST We've got the latest on Marouane Fellaini - and it's not good news for Manchester United fans. The latest news is that the deal is stalling, with Everton not settline for United's reduced fee. The clock is ticking...

22:02: SIGNING! Sunderland have completed the signing of Fabio Borini on loan from Liverpool.

The 22-year-old has become Paolo Di Canio's 13th signing of
the summer at the Stadium of Light - dwarfing the recruitment drive at neighbours Newcastle. Read more

Flying the flag: Sunderland have completed the signing of Fabio Borini on loan from Liverpool

22.00: One hour to go until the closure of the transfer
window and not even Lukaku knows where he wants to be for the rest of the
season

'From Sportsmail's John Edwards: 'Romelu Lukaku is evidently
torn over what to do next after West Brom’s last-minute attempt to hijack his
proposed loan move to Everton.

'The Belgium striker was already dismayed at being told he
could leave on another temporary transfer less than a week after apparently
receiving assurances that he would spend the season at Stamford Bridge.

'His closest advisers are believed to be urging him to stick
with the original plan of joining Everton, but the prospect of another campaign
at The Hawthorns does appeal to him.'
