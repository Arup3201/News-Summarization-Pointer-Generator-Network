Red, auburn, carrot, strawberry blonde and (at least one) scarlet – all shades of ginger hair were present at this weekend’s Redhed Days Festival.

More than 5,000 redheads from 80 countries attended the global event in Breda, The Netherlands, breaking its own world record.

The festival, which has been held since 2005, also saw the world’s first attempt to a ‘ginger’s only’ flight when a plane-load of redheads were flown in from Scotland.

Fair skin and red hair first appeared around the time people settled in Europe 50,000 years ago and still remains a dominant gene in southern Europeans today, according to a new study

As well as attracting thousands of 
gingers from all over the globe, Redhead Days Festival beat its own 
Guinness World Record for the largest gathering of redheads.

With
 one of the world’s most famous red heads at the centre of the crowd, 
McDonald’s mascot Ronald, 1,672 redheads got together in one spot.

But it was not the only attempt to break a record.

Airline
 Flybe's scheduled flight from Inverness to Amsterdam was entirely 
operated by auburn-haired pilots and cabin crew while alcoholic ginger 
beer was among the refreshments on offer for passengers.

Overall, including passengers, it is thought that around a third of those travelling on the flight were natural redheads.

Red-y to go: The first 'Redheadday' - Roodharigendag - was held in the Netherlands in 2005

A
 Prince Harry look-alike was among those on board while a 95-year-old 
redheaded Inverness resident, Margaret Swan, was on hand to wave the 
flight off, the airline said.

Speaking
 ahead of the flight, captain Gaeron Kayley said: 'I've always been 
proud of my natural red hair, so it's a real honour for me to pilot this
 special flight from Inverness to Amsterdam.'

The
 festival has been held annually since 2005, increasing in size each 
year from the 150 first attendants to this year’s 5,000 plus.

To
 attend you are required to have natural ginger hair and sees redheads 
get together for a weekend of events, picnics, motivational classes and 
community building.

Each year goes by a different colour to make a standout group photography, this year, the colour was blue.

Record breaking: A full 1,672 redheads, accompanied by famous redhead Ronald McDonald, set the Guinness World Record for the largest gathering of redheads at the festival
