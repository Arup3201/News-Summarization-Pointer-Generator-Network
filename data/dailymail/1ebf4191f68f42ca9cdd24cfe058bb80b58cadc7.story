Should FIFA ban Luis Suarez after latest bite storm?

Uruguay striker Luis Suarez has until 9pm tonight to produce any evidence to defend his  extraordinary biting of Giorgio Chiellini during the victory over Italy.

But there is nothing in the complex FIFA rulebook preventing Suarez's shocking previous record for biting opponents being taken into account.

An expected  six-strong independent FIFA disciplinary committee, chaired by Switzerland's Claudio Sulser, will then decide his fate with the possibility of a decision late tonight.

FIFA have to act fast with Uruguay due to play their last sixteen match against Columbia at the Maracana on Saturday.

The 
likelihood is that Suarez's ban will end his involvement in the 
tournament, but FIFA would  not speculate about the Uruguayan's 
punishment.

The
 disciplinary committee have requested audio and  TV evidence of the 
incident with the super high definition coverage likely to make it 
glaringly clear that Suarez was guilty of biting - this time on 
Chiellini's shoulder - for the third time in his career - despite 
fanciful claims from the Uruguayan federation that the video evidence 
might have been doctored.

A
 FIFA spokeswoman said: 'The processes are outlined in the disciplinary 
code, but we cannot anticipate what will happen or a precise timeframe. 
But they are fully aware of the urgency with Uruguay still in the 
competition. 

'They are focusing 100 per cent on the proceedings without any involvement from any other body or FIFA figure.  

Article
 118 states if a ban is for less than three matches or upto two months, 
no appeal is allowed  which would rule out the chances of  Suarez  using
 the system to  delay his suspension from the tournament.

But
 the complicated framework would allow Suarez to appeal if he is banned 
for 3 or 4 matches . And  even if an appeal to FIFA is ruled out by the 
size of his punishment, there is still the possibility of  an appeal to 
the Court of Arbitration for Sport whon are on call in Switzerland      

To
 add to the difficulties of independence and possible conflicts of 
interest, Sulser's Switzerland are still in the tournament.

Meanwhile, the global heads of department at adidas’ have held a meeting in
Rio today about Suarez and how this latest incident effects them. They will
give a more detailed response when FIFA release their findings.

An adidas spokesperson said: 'adidas is aware of the
issue involving Luis Suarez. We await FIFA's full investigation into this
matter and will respond accordingly.'
