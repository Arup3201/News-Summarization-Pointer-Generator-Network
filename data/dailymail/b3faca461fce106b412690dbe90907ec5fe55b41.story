Artist Tracey Emin’s controversial unmade bed caused outrage when it was included in the 1999 Turner Prize exhibition.

Now it is going under the hammer and is expected to reach up to £1.2million after its owner, multi-millionaire art collector, Charles Saatchi, decided to sell it.

My Bed - complete with soiled sheets, empty vodka bottles and cigarette butts - is worth nearly ten times more than what Mr Saatchi bought it for in 2000. Despite disagreeing with his politics, Ms Emin sold the bed for £150,000.

The piece is a ‘confessional self-portrait’ that was created in Ms Emin’s Waterloo flat in 1998 after the artist suffered a bout of severe depression accompanied by excessive drinking and bouts of casual sex.

The 50-year-old artist told The Telegraph the sale feels ‘like the end of an era. Saatchi’s had this Nineties thing in his house like a time capsule. Now it’s historical.’

Last weekend, David Maupin, Emin’s dealer in New York, who sold the bed to Saatchi, said he thinks the estimate of £800,000 to £1.2 million is too low for such a significant work.

‘It’s historic,’ he said. ‘It’s priceless.’

My Bed is going to be sold at auction this summer, when Christie’s offers Tracey Emin’s My Bed from Charles Saatchi’s collection.
