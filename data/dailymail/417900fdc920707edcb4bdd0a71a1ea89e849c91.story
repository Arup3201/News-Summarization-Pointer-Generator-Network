The receptionist claims Dr Julius Fadipe squeezed her right breast 'out of the blue' (file picture for illustration purposes only)

A GP accused of groping his receptionist’s breast claimed he accidentally touched her when reaching for printer paper.

The woman told a hearing that Dr Julius Fadipe squeezed her right breast ‘out of the blue’ after she brought him a cup of tea before morning surgery.

But Nigerian-born Dr Fadipe, 57, said he touched her by mistake because he reached for the paper while engrossed at his computer.

‘I was focused on the screen,’ the locum GP told a fitness to practise hearing at the Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service in Manchester.

‘I knew where the papers were and knew where the printer was. It was just reflex going towards the printer. I felt I hit somebody. It was purely accidental. Then I noticed it was her.’

Later on the day of September 22, 2011, he was told that the woman, called Miss A to protect her identity, had reported him.

Dr Fadipe was confronted by surgery bosses, but no action was taken after a trust investigation and police found there was insufficient evidence to proceed.

After the alleged incident, Dr Fadipe said he recalled that Miss A ‘made some passes’ at him when he worked at the West Midlands surgery six years earlier.

The married father of three claimed Miss A ‘came on to him’ three times. He said she had tried to kiss him, showed him saucy photographs and said she told him: ‘You don’t allow me to sleep at night because I was thinking about you all night.’

Miss A has denied his allegations. The General Medical Council accuses him of sexually motivated conduct and if the charge is proved he could be struck off.

Peter Horgan, for the GMC, told Dr Fadipe: ‘Rather than Miss A being the one who was making a play for you, it was you for her.’

Dr Fadipe, who works in Birmingham, Solihull and Worcestershire, qualified in Nigeria in 1985. He worked in Britain as a gynaecologist from 1990 to 2002, before retraining as a GP in 2004.

The hearing continues.
