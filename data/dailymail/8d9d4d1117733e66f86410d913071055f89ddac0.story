Police in Malawi have arrested a man for trying to strangle to death a 16-year-old albino boy, while Tanzanian authorities have arrested 200 witchdoctors in a crackdown on the shocking trade.

The suspect had been on the run after he was caught trying to kill the 16-year-old at his home in February and will soon appear in court facing a charge of attempted murder.

Across many parts of Africa, albinos are killed for their body parts, which are then sold to witchdoctors who use them for rituals and potions.

Six albinos have been killed in the impoverished southern African country since December, according to the Association of Persons with Albinism in Malawi.

Boniface Massah, the organisation's director, said Malawian albinos are 'living in fear of being attacked or killed' because of the recent spate of murders.

Belief in witchcraft runs deep in Malawi and albino body parts are often used in rituals. Even the bodies of dead albinos are sometimes exhumed and sold.

Earlier this week, UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein denounced attacks against albinos as 'stunningly vicious, with children in particular being targeted'. 

Countries in east and west Africa are worst affected, and Tanzania near Malawi has one of the highest attack rates, where body parts sell for around $600 and an entire corpse fetches $75,000.

Meanwhile, Tanzanian police said they had arrested 225 unlicensed traditional healers and soothsayers during a special operation carried out in several parts of the east African country and due to be extended to all 30 regions.

Advera Bulimba, a police spokesperson, said: 'Some of those arrested were found in possession of items like lizard skin, warthog teeth, ostrich eggs, monkey tails, bird claws, mule tails and lion skin.'

He added the police campaign would target the entire network of gangsters, traders and witchdoctors, adding that 97 of those detained had already appeared in court.

The statement also appealed to religious leaders, traditional elders, politicians and journalists 'to continue the awareness campaign against superstitious beliefs that are holding back the development of our country.'

The announcement comes after President Jakaya Kikwete said the ongoing attacks against people with albinism, whose body parts are used for witchcraft, were 'disgusting and a big embarrassment for the nation'.

In the most recently reported attack, a six-year-old albino boy's hand was hacked off with a machete and his mother assaulted as she tried to protect him.

On Tuesday, police said seven suspects had been arrested in connection with that attack, which left the boy and his mother hospitalised.

And last week a Tanzanian court sentenced four people to death for the murder of an albino woman whose legs and right hand were hacked off with an axe and machete. The killers who were convicted also included the husband of the murdered woman.

President Kikwete met with albino activists last week, promising to do more to stop the wave of violence.

'The government has long tried to do everything possible to stop the killings, we are very serious with this,' he said.

'But we still need to enhance our efforts to bring to an end these killings, which are disgusting and a big embarrassment to the nation.'

Albinism is a hereditary genetic condition which causes a total absence of pigmentation in the skin, hair and eyes. It affects one Tanzanian in 1,400, often as a result of inbreeding, experts say.
