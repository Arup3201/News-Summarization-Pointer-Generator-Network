A pregnant woman was arrested after sharing photos of herself wearing a leopard-print dress she allegedly stole just hours before.

Danielle Saxton, 27, allegedly took clothes and jewelry from Mortie's Boutique in Illinois while staff were in the storeroom on July 11.

The West Frankfort woman then posted four snaps of herself in the merchandise, making one her profile picture.

Mortie's co-owner, Kert Williams, said he posted about the theft on Facebook and people who'd seen Saxton's photos made the connection and called police.

Williams told WSIL-TV he was returning to the store when he saw Saxton leaving with items including a dress, shirts and jewelry.

Suspecting it was a theft, he checked security footage which, he said, confirmed his fears.

'Her excuse was there was nobody in 
here,' Williams said. 'We were in the back working, and that she could just take it. You 
know, not really much of an excuse there.'

Social media users reported Saxton when Williams posted about what was stolen on the shop's Facebook page.

'What she stole was a very distinct leopard dress,' Williams said.

Police Chief Shawn Talluto said when officers arrested Saxton at her home, she still had the clothes in her hand.

'We just had a description and a direction of travel, but when the social media aspect played into it, we were able to identify who it was. And by looking at the background of the photograph we were able to pinpoint where she was at,' he told WSIL-TV.

'When you put something out there, it's a matter of minutes before it can go viral, and it can go to the world.'

Saxton was released from jail on her own recognizance.
