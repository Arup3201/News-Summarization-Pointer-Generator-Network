Jailed: Thomas Old, 23, subjected his girlfriend to a sadistic four-hour attack while her young daughter was in the next room

A jealous thug has been jailed after subjecting  his girlfriend to a sadistic four-hour attack while her young daughter was in the next room.

Thomas Old, 23, flew into a violent rage when he wrongly thought Rachel McGoldrick had been seeing another man.

Armed with gaffer tape and rope, he let himself into her flat using a stolen key, stripped her and tied her up.

Having bound and gagged her, Old strangled Miss McGoldrick into unconsciousness, attempted to gouge out her eye and repeatedly beat her.

Miss McGoldrick’s horrific injuries included bleeding on the brain, two breaks in her back, a broken eye socket, a broken nose, a broken finger and significant cuts and bruising.

Afterwards Old took Miss McGoldrick, a midwifery student, to hospital but forced her to wash off the blood in the shower first.

He then made her lie to police, claiming she had been attacked by strangers in the street.

Officers did not believe the story and discovered blood-spattered walls in the bedroom and bathroom of her flat in Bournemouth, Dorset.

Old pleaded guilty to one count of grievous bodily harm at Bournemouth Crown Court and was jailed by a judge who told him he had shown no mercy to his victim.

The court heard that Old suffered from bouts from paranoia brought on by prolonged cannabis abuse and he had got it into his mind Miss McGoldrick had been cheating on him with her former partner.

He bombarded Miss McGoldrick with vile text messages and hacked her Facebook account to post pornographic pictures of her.

On November 27 last year he went to her flat in Bournemouth and carried out the attack while her two-year-old daughter was there.

Rufus Taylor, prosecuting, described the crime as ‘a horrific and sustained attack over a number of hours driven by a perverse sense of jealousy’.

Judge Peter Johnson said it is ‘inevitable’ that Miss McGoldrick will suffer ‘long-term, if not permanent, psychological damage.’

He said: 'You thought she had been seeing her ex-partner in a non-platonic way.

Bournemouth Crown Court heard Old strangled Miss McGoldrick into unconsciousness, attempted to gauge out her eye and repeatedly beat her

'Rachel was subjected to a sadistic, sustained and brutal attack, there are no adequate adjectives to describe what you did to her.

'She thought you were going to rape her.

'All the time this happened her young child was in the next room.

'You were striking her while she was bound and bleeding, you showed her no mercy whatsoever.'

David Richards, defending, said Old had ADHD as a child and was unpopular at school, eventually being sent to a residential school in Kendall.

He said prolonged use of cannabis and more recent use of steroids had made his paranoia worse and he feared rejection.

Mr Richards said Old had started his own business and ‘bitterly regrets what he did and hates himself for it.’
