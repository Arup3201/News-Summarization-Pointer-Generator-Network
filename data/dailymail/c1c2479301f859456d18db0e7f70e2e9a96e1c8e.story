The Professional Footballers Association are exploring ways of outlawing initiation ceremonies despite them being a tradition for many clubs in England.

They are often used to welcome players joining a first team, be it from the academy or as a new signing, with singing a song in front of the rest of the squad a popular choice.

But, as Gary Neville revealed in his autobiography 'Red', sometimes young players are forced into embarrassing acts for the enjoyment of first-team players.

Gary Neville was forced to take part in embarrassing acts during his time as a Manchester United apprentice

Sky Sports pundit Neville, pictured with Jamie Carragher, wrote about his initiations in autobiography 'Red'

Discussing his time as a young player at Manchester United, Neville wrote: 'Making love to Clayton Blackmore was one of the worst things about being an apprentice at United. Not the real Clayton Blackmore, obviously. He was sat in the dressing room p****** himself with laughter like the rest of the first-teamers.

'No, this was a lifesize picture of our pin-up defender which would be stuck on to the treatment table by a senior player with a vicious sense of humour. As Barry White music played, I, or whichever unlucky apprentice had been chosen, would have to dance around the table and pretend to get off with Wales's right-back. 

'I can't tell you how excruciating that is for a 16-year-old in front of an audience of his heroes like Mark Hughes and Bryan Robson.'

Neville also revealed that anyone who refused to take part would be hit over the head with a football wrapped in a towel or given a dead arm by a line of second-year apprentices.

Wimbledon's Crazy Gang of the 1980s and 1990s were famed for their initiation ceremonies and pranks

The former United defender, who spent 20 years at Old Trafford, added that another punishment for young players was having the entire United kit rubbed on to them in dubbin with a wire brush, while being thrown into a moving tumble dryer was also popular.

Although initiations are often good natured, it may well be stories like these which have forced the PFA to take steps to stop ceremonies taking place.

Speaking ahead of Monday night's clash against Liverpool, AFC Wimbledon midfielder Dan Bulman said: 'We have initiation songs but that's all getting ushered out by the PFA now.

'I was on a course the other day and they are now trying to put a stop to it.

'One player in the Premier League on his first away trip was told that he had to sing a song and he said, 'No, I haven't got to do that'.

Former Aston Villa assistant manager Roy Keane is not a fan of initiation ceremonies

'That is the way that the game is going and the PFA now want to catch up with the times.'

Neville's former team-mate, Roy Keane, was never a fan of initiations as a player and believes there are better ways of making new players feel part of the squad.

Speaking to ShortList magazine during his time as Aston Villa assistant manager, Keane said: 'No, I don't like that stuff. It happens now at Villa, but if I was a player at a new club and someone said, "You've got to sing tonight," I just f****** wouldn't do it. I sing for nobody. 

'People say it's banter, but I don't like that type of banter. I'd help players by making sure they settled in properly, making sure my wife touched base with their family. That was my way.'
