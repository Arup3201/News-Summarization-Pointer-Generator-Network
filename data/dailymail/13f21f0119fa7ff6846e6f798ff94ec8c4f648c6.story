A 30-year-old employee of Prince Charles's charity for young people died after taking a bad batch of ecstasy.

Nick Bonnie, whose mother works in drug rehabilitation, is believed to have swallowed a pill from what police described as a 'bad batch' of the drug.

He and five friends were taken to hospital during a 'lads' weekend in Manchester when they became ill on Friday night.

Mr Bonnie was pronounced dead at Manchester Royal Infirmary at 4.30 the following morning.

In
a statement, Mr Bonnie’s parents Pauline and Andy Bonnie said: 'This 
news has devastated the lives of us, Nick’s two brothers Thomas and 
Ryan, and his beautiful devoted girlfriend, Leah.

'Our
family and friends, Nick’s friends, work colleagues, all those who had 
the privilege of knowing him and those he helped in his employment with 
the Prince's Trust, are equally devastated.

'Nick
was born in King’s Stanley and went to the local primary school. He 
progressed to Marling before taking a gap year and travelling around 
Australia before gaining his degree at university in Plymouth.

'He
returned home to work with a local firm of solicitors in Stroud before 
embarking on the true vocation of his life, working with the Prince’s 
Trust.

'He has helped many 
young people in the early stages of his employment there and helped 
raise funds and promote the profile of the Trust in his current role.

'He has been to Highgrove on several occasions and attended one of the Queen’s garden parties at Buckingham Palace.

Speaking on Saturday his mother Pauline said Nick was not a drug user - and the tragedy has left them ‘in pieces’.

She said: ‘He was such such a beautiful boy, just so loved by everyone that knew him or had ever met him.

‘He
lived life to the full and he was surrounded by friends, family and an 
incredible girlfriend who are all in pieces after this tragedy.

‘He was out with friends in Manchester and we think that he took a dirty substance.

‘He
realised something was wrong straight away and went to the medical 
centre but unfortunately he just collapsed and couldn't be saved.

Kind-hearted: Nick, originally from Stroud, Gloucestershire, but living in Bristol with his girlfriend Leah Wilkins, worked for the Prince's Trust

‘Taking drugs is so out of character for him, he's always had a wise head on young shoulders, and so as a family we are trying not to be angry for one silly mistake that was made.

‘I can't thank everyone enough, they worked so hard to try and keep him alive and the matrons on the ward were outstanding.

‘The messages of support have just been overwhelming, I can't begin to tell you how many lives he touched.

‘I really want people to be aware of the dangers of taking drugs in nightclubs - it's cost our precious son his life and ours have been taken too.’

Officers from Manchester police are investigating the death.

Detective Inspector Aaron Duggan, of Manchester Police, said: ‘First and foremost, our thoughts go out to the family of this young man following this tragedy.

‘We have now launched an investigation to establish the circumstances leading up to his death.

‘It is possible that there may a particularly bad batch of drugs out there in the community and that is a concern to us.

‘I would always urge people not to take illegal drugs and remind them that you do not know what they have been made up with.

‘They can contain poisons and illicit chemicals that can have potentially fatal effects.’

Detectives are investigating whether there may have been a 'bad batch' of drugs circulating in the club and have appealed for information.

‘To all those who heard on the National news on Saturday 28th September 2013, a 30 year old man from Gloucestershire had lost his life in a Manchester nightclub after taking illicit substances - this was our son, local boy, young man, Nick Bonnie.

‘We don't want to have any obituary or such like printed but have decided that his life was too precious and important to go unreported.

‘He played local football for Kings Stanley Youth teams up until the age of 16, Leonard Stanley Under 18s, Brimscombe &Thrupp and finally Cashes Green. Nick was a keen sportsman, avid follower of Liverpool AFC and only last week completed the ‘Tough Mudder’ challenge for Help the Heroes in Wales. Nick was known by many as having a big heart, big personality and the most infectious smile in Stroud.

‘Nick Bonnie lost his life tragically, senselessly and needlessly in a nightclub in Manchester on a 'lads' weekend. This has devastated the lives of us, his parents, his two brothers Thomas and Ryan, and his beautiful and devoted girlfriend, Leah. Our family and friends, Nick's friends, work colleagues and all those who had the privilege of knowing him and those he helped in his employment at the Princes Trust.

‘Nick was born in King's Stanley and went to the local primary school. He progressed to Marling before taking a gap year and travelling around Australia before gaining his degree at University in Plymouth.

'He returned home to work with a local firm of solicitors in Stroud before embarking on the true vocation of his life, working at the Princes Trust. He has helped many young people in the early stages of his employment with them and helped raise funds and promote the profile of the Trust in his current role. He has been to Highgrove on several occasions and attended one of the Queen's garden parties at Buckingham Palace.

‘Everyone who knew Nick was aware he loved life, lived it to the max and in making one stupid mistake he has cost himself his life.

‘We hope that after reading this, we may have gone some way in helping anyone/ everyone in the realisation that drinking and use of any illicit drugs are a killer with consequences that will devastate lives for ever.

‘Our thanks go to all those who have taken to time to send messages of support to out family. Our lives and all those who were blessed to share a part of his are broken. Our life will never be the same without Nick and he will never be forgotten.’
