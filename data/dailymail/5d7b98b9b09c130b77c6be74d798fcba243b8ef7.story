Tottenham vs Sunderland (White Hart Lane)

Team news

Tottenham 

Tottenham head coach Mauricio Pochettino is likely to welcome back a host of first-team regulars for Saturday's visit of Sunderland.

Spurs made seven changes for their FA Cup third-round replay win over Burnley on Wednesday night and the likes of Harry Kane, Federico Fazio, Christian Eriksen and Hugo Lloris should all return against the Black Cats.

Pochettino also confirmed Emmanuel Adebayor will be in his squad having not played since November whilst Erik Lamela (calf) and Ryan Mason (hamstring) are doubtful with Nabil Bentaleb away on international duty with Algeria.

Provisional squad: Lloris, Vorm, Friedel, Walker, Naughton, Rose, Davies, Dier, Fazio, Kaboul, Yedlin, Vertonghen, Chiriches, Stambouli, Dembele, Paulinho, Capoue, Eriksen, Chadli, Lennon, Townsend, Soldado, Adebayor, Kane.

Sunderland 

Jermain Defoe could be handed a Sunderland debut at former club Tottenham on Saturday after completing his move from Toronto.

The 32-year-old England international is included in the squad after signing a three-and-a-half year deal with Jozy Altidore heading in the opposite direction, and will be joined by fit-again frontman Steven Fletcher following his recovery from a groin problem.

However, central midfielder Liam Bridcutt is suspended after his sending-off against Liverpool last weekend and natural replacement Lee Cattermole is still out with a groin injury, as is full-back Anthony Reveillere, who needs another week to shake off an Achilles problem.

Provisional squad: Pantilimon, Mannone, Jones, Van Aanholt, O'Shea, Brown, Vergini, Coates, Rodwell, Gomez, Larsson, Johnson, Buckley, Alvarez, Mavrias, Giaccherini, Wickham, Fletcher, Defoe.

Liam Bridcutt saw red in Sunderland's narrow defeat against Liverpool at home last Saturday

Kick-off: Saturday 3pm

Odds (subject to change)

Tottenham 8/13

Draw 14/5

Sunderland 5/1

Referee: Chris Foy

Managers: Mauricio Pochettino (Tottenham) Gus Poyet (Sunderland)
