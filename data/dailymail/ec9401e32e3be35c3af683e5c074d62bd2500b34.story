The grieving widow of beheaded mountain guide Herve Gourdel stepped out in the public for the first time today to pay tribute to her husband who was murdered by Islamist militants.

A visibly distraught Francoise was comforted by friends as she and her son Erwan took part in a gathering in honor of the 55-year-old Frenchman.

It came as flags were held at half-mast in France today, after President Francois Hollande declared three days of mourning for the murdered mountain guide.

Across the French capital, thousands of Muslims came out in solidarity to pay tribute to Mr Gourdel and protest against the Islamic State, which many insist does not represent their religion.

Imams and ordinary Muslims have rallied to condemn the execution, carrying placards stating: 'Not in My Name'.

Hundreds gathered outside the Paris Mosque after Friday prayers carrying signs expressing condolences and denouncing the 'barbarism' of Islamic State militants. 

'This gathering is the strong and vibrant expression of our desire for national unity and of our unwavering will to live together,' Dalil Boubakeur, head of the French Council of the Muslim Faith - an official representative for the country's roughly five million Muslims - told the gathering outside Paris's main mosque.

'Islam is a religion of peace', he said, adding it 'orders respect for life'.

Leading Muslim figures also signed a message published in French newspapers Friday condemning 'atrocities committed in the name of a murderous ideology hiding behind the Islamic religion'.

'We are also the 'filthy French',' said the statement, referring to the epithet the Islamic State group has used.

Back in the southern Alpine village of Saint-Martin-Vesubie, where Gourdel worked as a mountain guide, locals, school students and other guides marched Thursday evening in memory of a man they described as hugely curious about the world.

More than 800 people - including three imams - took part in the march past his office, stopping at times to light candles or lay flowers down.

"Herve was a humanist full of an overwhelming passion for the mountain that illuminated his life," fellow guides said in a joint statement.

Jund al-Khilifa, or 'Soldiers of the Caliphate', beheaded Mr Gourdel after he was abducted on September 21 while hiking in a national park in Algeria - an area that was once a magnet for tourists but later became a sanctuary for Islamists.

Less than 24 hours earlier, militants had uploaded a video to YouTube warning that the married father-of-two would be killed unless France pulled out of a coalition of nations bombing targets connected to the ISIS in Iraq.

The kidnapping came following a chilling call by IS militants for Muslims to kill citizens from countries involved in a US-led coalition fighting the extremists, 'especially the spiteful and filthy French'.

The threat sparked concern in France, and authorities have since strengthened security in public places and on transport.

The foreign ministry also widened its vigilance alert for nationals abroad from around 30 countries earlier this week to some 40 nations - including Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines.

France has nevertheless said it refuses to be cowed by IS threats. The government announced Thursday air strikes had been carried out in Iraq - the second bombing raids in the space of a week.

Fighter planes destroyed four hangars near Fallujah city, west of Baghdad, that 'likely' contained weapons and other equipment, a military source said.

Paris opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq but was one of the first to sign up for an active role in the US-led campaign against the IS group.

It has six Rafale fighter jets based in the United Arab Emirates, carrying out the strikes in Iraq.

While it has pledged to push forward with the air strikes, Paris has stressed it will not deploy ground troops, nor will it expand operations to Syria, as the United States has done.

But the presidency announced France would 'continue and intensify its support for Syrian opposition forces who are fighting jihadist groups'.

Yesterday, thousands of Algerian soldiers supported by helicopters were hunting for the terrorists in the Tizi Ouzou region, along with 500 marines and sniffer dogs.

'Everything will be done to bring the killers to justice,' said a spokesman for Algeria's Defence Ministry.

There are fears that other radical Islamist groups may carry out copycat attacks on Westerners following calls to do so by ISIS on Sunday.

The kidnapping and murder of Gourdel, however, is believed to be a crime of opportunity, since Algeria's extremist have been confined to remote mountainous regions and the French mountaineer was one of only a very few foreigners to venture into this area.

Hundreds of people paid tribute to mountain-guide Herve Gourdel, who was  he was abducted on September 21 while hiking in a national park that was once a magnet for tourists but later became a sanctuary for Islamists.

The sickening four minute 46 second video of Mr Gourdel's murder - titled 'A Message in Blood for the French Government' - was released exactly 30 minutes after Barack Obama gave a speech vowing to destroy ISIS and its affiliates to the UN General Assembly.

In his speech President Obama urged the world to come together to tackle the threat posed by ISIS and 'dismantle this network of death'. The address ended at 10.38am New York time, with the existence of Mr Gourdel's murder video revealed just 30 minutes later, at 11.09am.

On Tuesday a video posted on YouTube showed Mr Gourdel surrounded by masked men holding Kalashnikov rifles.

The group threatened to kill their hostage by the end of the day unless France ceased its air strikes in Iraq, where ISIS terrorists control vast swaths of territory under the guise of a 'caliphate'. 

The footage prompted some 1,500 Algerian forces to comb through the restive, mountainous Tizi Ouzou region in the east of Algeria - desperately trying to save Mr Gourdel before it was too late.

Speaking at the United Nations in New York, Mr Hollande said: 'France is going through an ordeal because of the murder of one of its citizens, but France will never give in to blackmail.

'France will never give in to terrorism because it is our duty and above all, it is our honour.The fight against terrorism must continue and be stepped up.'

Politicians lined up to condemn Mr Gourdel's murder, all vowing to fight terrorism.

Prime Minister Manuel Valls said: 'The support of the whole nation goes to Herve Gourdel's family. France will never give in.'

MP Laurent Wauqiuez said: 'Barbarity cannot defeat the values of democracy.'

Herve Morin, of the UDI party, tweeted: 'To Gourdel's murderers: You are monsters and you are hideous.'

And the National Front's Louis Aliot said: 'All my thoughts are with the family of our compatriot, cowardly executed by the enemies of our civilisation.'

Christian Estrosi, the deputy mayor of Nice who visited Mr Gourdel's family, said the whole country had been plunged into a period of 'national mourning.'

He said Mr Gourdel's elderly parents and children were dealing with their loss 'with dignity, anger and an unspeakable pain'.
