Richard Monkhouse, chairman of the Magistrates’ Association, said offenders are walking away with just a caution

Drug dealers who sell cannabis outside school gates are escaping with nothing more than a slap on the wrist, the Magistrates’ Association warned last night.

Other serious offenders who are being let off with a caution or fine include serial burglars, muggers and even rapists.

Instead of being hauled before a court, they walk away with a caution, fixed penalty notice or so-called community resolution. 

Richard Monkhouse, chairman of the Magistrates’ Association, said the revelations would lead the public to wonder if the justice system was ‘broken’. 

In evidence to MPs, he said magistrates believed that between 30 and 35 per cent of out-of-court disposals were being administered ‘inappropriately’.

They fear police officers are looking to settle cases ‘quickly’ – but with no regard to trying to change a criminal’s ways.

He gave the disturbing example of drug pushers being given only a cannabis warning, which was supposed to be for people caught with a small amount of the Class B substance.

Recent studies have warned the drug can inflict enormous harm on young minds – with teenagers who smoke it at much greater risk of addiction and psychosis than adults.

Mr Monkhouse said: ‘It is right somebody picked up on the street with a spliff should be given a cannabis warning, but should somebody caught selling drugs outside a school? Because they are.’

A cannabis warning does not even constitute a formal criminal record.

Police had previously insisted drug users – especially those stood close to schools - would not be eligible for a cannabis warning.

Guidance drawn up by chief constables states the sanction ‘does not apply to offences of possession with intent to supply cannabis or any other supply offence.’

Appearing before the home affairs select committee, Mr Monkhouse went on: ‘When you start seeing people being cautioned for multiple robberies, multiple burglaries, you start to think, is not there something going wrong here?

‘That is when the public start to think, Is this system broken?’

Mr Monkhouse said another example was rape, which would make people think ‘how on earth is that given an out-of-court disposal’?’

Since 2010, at least 90 rapists have been punished with a caution, even though the offence carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.

Mr Monkhouse said that, in some cases, a crime which is reported as a rape is downgraded by the police until it becomes a sexual assault or other lesser offence.

Officers then consider it more suitable for a slap-on-the-wrist sanction.

He said there are a number of reasons why cautions are being given out when a case should be brought before magistrates, at the very least.

He told MPs: ‘There has been an issue with a target culture and an issue with the fact out-of-court disposals are covered by guidance rather than statutory provision. There are 43 chief constables who will all interpret it in a different way to suit their own areas.’

He added that some police saw the punishment as a way of dealing with an offence ‘quickly, never mind stopping the offender’s behaviour’.

In total over the past four years, police have issued almost 15,000 cautions for offences that would typically result in jail – including 2,279 for sexual assault, 783 for robbery and 11,347 for burglary.

In 1971, only 6 per cent of offenders were given a caution, which carries no sanction except a reprimand. The figure reached 20 per cent by last year, though this was down from 31 per cent in 2007.

There were 181,000 cautions issued last year which meant the offender avoided being hauled before the courts – including 29,560 handed out to criminals by the Metropolitan Police.

A quarter of offences of violence againt the person are dealt with by a caution, along with 17.4 per of sex attacks, 20 per cent of thieves and almost 40 per cent of those guilty of criminal damage and arson.

Surrey Chief Constable Lynne Owens, who speaks for the police service on out of court disposals, insisted they had a valuable role to play when used properly.

She told the MPs that, since 2007, the percentage of all crimes solved which were dealt with in this way had fallen from 10 per cent to 4.8 per cent.
