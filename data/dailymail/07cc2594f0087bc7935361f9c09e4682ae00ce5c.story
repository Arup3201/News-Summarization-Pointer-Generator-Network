For wealthy Victorians, visiting pyramids built by the Ancient Egyptians was one of the highlights in their grand tours.

But now anyone can wander round the last of the Seven Wonders of the World from the comfort of their sofa, because Google has added pyramids and other sites in Giza, Egypt, to Google Street View.

The Great Pyramid and the Great Sphinx, which have stood for around 5,000 years, are two of the iconic landmarks mapped by Google’s team of trekkers.

Mapping on a grand scale: The Great Pyramid (pictured) and the Great Sphinx, which have stood for around 5,000 years, are two of the iconic landmarks mapped by Google’s team of trekkers near Cairo in Egypt

The ancient structures dominate the skyline of the Sahara desert and seem a world away from the bustling city of Cairo, which lies to the north-east.

Features of these landmarks and others in the Giza Necropolis can be seen up close in the Google Street View images and there are also glimpses of horses and carriages and market stalls around the historic sites.

The Great Pyramid was built as a tomb and a symbol of eternity for the Pharaoh Khufu. It stands 456ft (139 metres) high – just over nine double decker buses stacked on top of one another.

A holiday without the travel: Users of Google Street View can now see the Pyramids of Giza (pictured) from the comfort of their sofa,as the ancient landmarks have been mapped. Ancient pyramids dominate the skyline of the Sahara, while camels carry tourists to see the amazing sites

Purrfect shot? To the east of the pyramids sits the Great Sphinx, which is the oldest and largest known monumental sculpture in the world. With the body of a lion and the head of a human, it measures a grand 239ft (73 metres) long and 65ft (20 metres) high. The  creature is believed to resemble Pharaoh Khafre

Palm-fringed fortress: The Citadel of Qaitbay, a 15th-century defensive fortress perched atop the Mediterranean coast,  has also been caught on camera 

It was the tallest man-made structure on Earth for 3,800 years and is accompanied by the smaller pyramids of Khafre and Menkaure, which have also been mapped by Google.

With the body of a lion and the head of a human, it measures a grand 239ft (73 metres) long and 65ft (20 metres) high. Literally translating to ‘Father of Dread,’ this mythical creature is believed to resemble Pharaoh Khafre, who was the ruler at the time of construction.

Stepping outside the necropolis, Google also mapped the Pyramid of Djoser –which is the first to be designed by the great Egyptian architect Imhotep and lies in the burial ground of Saqqara.

What a view: The ancient structures dominate the skyline of the Sahara desert and seems a world away from the bustling city of Cairo

A more modern mosque: Google also mapped more modern architectural wonders, such as Cairo Citadel and the Mosque of Muhammad Ali (pictured)

The Egyptian virtual tour also includes slightly modern wonders such as Abu Mena, which is one of the oldest sites of Christianity in Egypt and a spectacular mosque.

The Hanging Church – one of the oldest Coptic Churches in the world, a medieval Islamic fortification known as the Cairo Citadel and the Citadel of Qaitbay, a 15th-century defensive fortress perched atop the Mediterranean coast have also been caught on camera.

Users can visit the Google Cultural Institute to learn more about the treasures of ancient Egypt through historic photographs and ancient artefacts.

‘The Pyramids of Giza have survived nearly five millennia, and stand as a testament to the ingenuity of the ancient people who built them. Now this legacy is preserved in a new way with panoramic and immersive Street View imagery,’ Tarek Abdalla,Google’s Head of Marketing in the Middle East and Africa wrote.

Google has previously mapped the temple of Angkor Wat, Cambodia, and the Taj Mahal in India as well as the Great Barrier Reef. 

A sense of size: Seeing the ancient landmarks from the perspective of a tourist allows Google Street View visitors to gain a sense of how massive the pyramids are and how hard it must have been for workers or slaves some 4,500 years ago to erect the massive monuments

Life on the hoof: Google's trekkers have also captured signs of local life including horse and carts (pictured) and market stalls
