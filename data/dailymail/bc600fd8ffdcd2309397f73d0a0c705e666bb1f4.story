Australian forward Trent Waterhouse is to leave Warrington at the end of the season, the club have announced.

The 33-year-old second rower, who won two caps for the Kangaroos, has made 78 appearances for Warrington since joining them from Penrith Panthers three years ago and was in their Challenge Cup-winning team in 2012.

The Wolves are also parting company with winger Chris Riley, who has spent most of the season on loan at Wakefield, and fringe players Jordan Burke, Danny Bridge, James Saltonstall and Gavin Bennion.

Wakefield are keen to retain the services of the Warrington-born Riley, who has scored 120 tries in 180 appearances since making his debut in 2005. His only appearance this year was in the opening fixture against St Helens.

Waterhouse is expected to hang up his boots, along with hooker Michael Monaghan, who announced his decision to retire earlier this year.

Warrington are also parting company with first team coaches Willie Poching and Richard Marshall, as well as conditioner Chris Baron, sports scientist Andy Holleyhead, soft tissue therapist Amanda Turner and joint Under-19s community coach Danny Fullerton.

Warrington's head of coaching and rugby Tony Smith, who has appointed former Wakefield and Hull boss Richard Agar as his new right-hand man for next season, said: 'All of these players and coaches have been a pleasure to work with over their time at the club and have contributed to our continuing success.

'We've all built up a great relationship and anybody who has been part of the Warrington family will always be welcomed back. We wish them all well for the future and look forward to our paths crossing in the future.'

Best wishes: Wolves head coach Tony Smith has expressed gratitude to those leaving the club
