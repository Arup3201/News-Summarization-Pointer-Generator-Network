Princes William and Harry were back together with the so-called 'Glosse Posse' today as they attended the wedding of a childhood friend 

The royals watched on as Victoria Inskip, who has known the princes since they were teenagers, married Robert Davies-Jones at Malmesbury Abbey this afternoon.

But the Duchess of Cambridge was absent from the wedding signalling she is still suffering from severe ante-natal sickness.

Prince William and Harry were seen mingling with the guests at the wedding of their close friend Victoria Inskip at Malmesbury Abbey, Wiltshire

Although the princes were at the wedding, the Duchess of Cambridge did not attend, signalling she may still be suffering from ante-natal sickness

The bride, Victoria Inskip has been a fund-raiser for Prince Harry's African charity Sentebale 

However, they were joined by close friends Guy Pelly and the bride's brother Thomas Inskip, also known as Skippy, who are part of the set, which revolves around the exclusive Beaufort Hunt.

The Duchess has not been seen since it was announced earlier this month that she was pregnant with the couple's second child.

At the time Kensington Palace officials confirmed that she was suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, the same condition that led to her being hospitalised during her first pregnancy with Prince George.

Last week Prince William had to take her place on an official trip to Malta after she was too ill to go.  

Miss Inskip, and her brother Thomas have known Princes William and Harry since they were regulars at the Club H 'nightclub' they set up in the basement of Highgrove, the Gloucestershire home of Prince Charles.

She has also been a fund-raiser for the African charity Sentebale, that was set up by Prince Harry to help vulnerable children in Lesotho and works as an estate agent.

Mr Davies Jones, 35, whose family are from Hexham, Northumberland and are friends of the Duke of Northumberland.

Meanwhile her brother, also known as 'Skippy' attended Eton with Prince Harry and is also credited with organising Prince William's stag party before his wedding in 2011.

He is known as Harry's best friend, often referred to as his 'wingman' and was with Harry on his ill-fated trip to Croatia in August in 2011.

During the trip, they got drunk on vodka, whisky, beer and tequila, and were photographed jumping into a pool fully-clothed at a nightclub on the party island of Hvar.

He was also with him on a skiing trip to Verbier in November when they amused themselves by throwing snowballs at unsuspecting passers-by from a balcony.

The siblings' father Owen Inskip, a field-master of Prince Charles’s favourite hunt, The Beaufort, has made a fortune over the years from a number of businesses, including ‘managing’ thousands of council homes for local authorities and upmarket estates.

Their maternal grandfather was the eccentric Labour peer Lord Rufus Noel-Buxton, an enthusiastic wader, who once forded the Thames at low tide, arriving on the steps of the Houses of Parliament. 

The family’s nine-bedroom country pile, Alderley Farm, near Wotton-under-Edge, Gloucestershire, was sold for more than £7 million in 2007. 

Also attending today's wedding was another close friend of the princes Guy Pelly and his wife Elizabeth Wilson, the granddaughter of the Holiday Inn hotel empire founder.

Mr Pelly became friendly with Prince William in 2001 when they were both junior members of the Beaufort Hunt and so became close to Harry too. 

The princes were also at Mr Pelly's wedding earlier this year in Memphis, Tennessee along with cousins Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie.
