An Ohio high school pupil, expelled and jailed for a fortnight for having a penknife in his car, now fears that his dream of serving in the US army could be wrecked.

Jordan Wiser’s nightmare began on December 12 last year when his car was searched by staff at Ashtabula County Technical and Career Campus in Jefferson, Ohio — about 60 miles northeast of Cleveland – following a message that he posted to his YouTube account.

“The principal said he had reason to believe I had weapons in my vehicle and needed to search it,’ Wiser said.

Jordan Wiser was expelled from school and spent almost a fortnight in jail because his headmaster found a knife in his paramedic uniform

‘He made me empty out all my pockets and the vice principal grabbed me and patted me down very forcibly, he told the Huffington Post.

‘It was somewhat awkward. Then they took my car keys. I told them what was in my car and said, “Don’t be alarmed”.’

The school claims that the online message gave it ‘probable cause’ to search Wiser and his car, something that Wiser disputes.

He told FoxNews.com: ‘I declined to allow them to search myself or my car and that I wanted to talk to my lawyer or my father. They told me it wasn’t an option.’

The school found the penknife, a stun gun and two Airsoft guns. Airsoft is similar to paintball.

The stun gun was for self-defence, Wiser said, adding that the penknife was part of his EMT kit.

‘My stun gun was locked in the glove box,’ Wiser told the Huffington Post, ‘and the knife was in my EMT medical vest.

'I bought it at K-Mart and have it as part of my first responder kit for cutting seat belts.

Jordan Wiser has dedicated his life to public service since he was 14. After he serves in the American army he wants to become either a policeman or fireman

‘There are kids at my school all the time who get caught with knives and are suspended.

‘My school is very rural, and people carry knives.

‘I can accept the fact that there was a lapse in judgment, and I can accept a punishment, but I have already been expelled from both the tech school and my home school.’

The teachers called the police and Wiser was charged with illegally taking the knife onto school grounds.

Staff told FoxNews.com that possession of the knife broke the school’s zero tolerance policy for bringing weapons on campus.

They also insisted Wiser consented to the search.

Superintendent Jerome Brockway said: “We indicate that we have the right to search, and he was aware of the policy.’

The right is enshrined in the school handbook, added Supt Brockway.

The decision to charge Wiser was made entirely by the police and the public prosecutors, he said.

Wiser who is a trainee paramedic and after service in the army wants to be either a policeman or fireman will learn his fate when he has a court hearing on April 1.

I dedicated my life to public service, and now a four-inch penknife could ruin everything

He has already been expelled from the Army’s Future Soldier Training System programme.

If his plan to enlist in the army in August is not achieved, he has said that he is considering suing.

‘If I am convicted of a felony, I’m never going to be a policeman. I’m never going to be a fireman. I’m never going to be in the military,’ he said.

‘I won’t even be able to be a janitor. I’m 18 years old, and this is going to ruin my entire life.

‘Never in my life did I think this would happen,’ Wiser said.

‘I dedicated my life to public service, and now a four-inch penknife could ruin everything.’
