Most scuba divers want to stay as far away from the gaping jaws of crocodiles as possible, but a pair of British photographers got close enough to one beast's teeth to be its dentists.

Nick Robertson-Brown, 62, and his wife Caroline, 41, took close-up pictures of Niño the crocodile in December 2014 at Jardines de la Reina, Cuba.

Taken just inches from the jaws of the reptile, the photographs show the stunning beauty of the three-metre deadly predator, whose name means little boy in Spanish.

Nick and Caroline Robertson-Brown took close-up pictures of Niño, an American crocodile, on a trip to Jardines de la Reina, Cuba

The photographers, from Manchester, were careful not to startle the animal when getting close enough to capture the details of its teeth

The pair, from Manchester, England, were accompanied on their journey by guide Gustavo, who made calls to Niño on a trip through the government-protected mangrove forest.

The American crocodile then swam out of the trees to see them - allowing the Robertson-Browns to capture the extraordinary pictures.

Avalon Cuban Diving Centers' guides have been working with Niño since he was very small, so he is now quite used to photographers getting close.

The photographers, who were outfitted in scuba gear, were able to stand in shallow water  during the encounter as they shot photos of the animal as it waded among the sea plants of its natural habitat.

The husband and wife team, who have been working together for 12 years as dive instructors and underwater photographers, said that the shallow water proved a challenging environment.

'The sediment very easy to stir up, so it was hard to get into position to get  shots, without disturbing the croc,' the pair said on their Facebook page.

Avalon Cuban Diving Centers regularly take trips out to the mangrove swamps to see crocodiles, who have been exposed to photographers since an early age

Only 700 divers per year are allowed to go to Jardines de la Reina, which is seven hours by bus and a six-hour boat ride from capital Havana

While the water was in danger of becoming murky, the stunning images show detailed images of Niño's snout as it cut through the swamp.

Mr Robertson-Brown said: 'We got into the water with the croc and got so close his teeth were almost touching our camera housings.

Though Niño is used to attention, the British snappers were wary of being snapped at suddenly by the scaly swimmer.

'It is a wild animal, so you have to be very careful, moving slowly and smoothly in the water so as not to startle or scare the croc.' 

The Robertson-Browns were worried that the sediment in the shallow water would make their pictures murky and limit the detail of the croc

Guide Gustavo helped lure the crocodile over to the photographers in scuba gear so that they could capture the amazing images of Niño

'Whilst we never felt in danger, as the croc was moving in a very easy going way, it is still an amazing, adrenalin-filled experience,' Mr Robertson-Brown said.

Only 700 divers are permitted to go each year to Jardines de la Reina, a national park that is a seven-hour bus ride and additional six-hour boat ride from Havana.

Mr Robertson-Brown, who has also photographed fish, sharks and manatees, called the experience was 'well worth it' because of the 'pristine reefs and amazing animal encounters.'

The pair said the Cuban expedition, during which they met Argentinean footballing legend Diego Maradona and photographed giant feral rats called jutías, was 'one of our most productive trips ever'.

The Jardines de la Reina, is home to a wide variety of marine vegetation and wildlife, including sharks and giant groupers that can weigh up to 400 pounds

Jardines de la Reina, which means Gardens of the Queen in Spanish and were named by Christopher Columbus, is a roughly 675 square mile coral reef system about 60 miles off of Cuba's southern coast, according to Diver Magazine.  

The 250-island archipelago includes portions of reef and mangrove swamp that house animals including sharks, goliath groupers that can weigh up to 400 pounds, loggerhead turtles and American crocodiles such as Niño. 

American crocodiles, which live in the Caribbean from southern Florida to the north coast of South America, are listed as vulnerable by Red List.

While the animal's skin is legally traded from some farms in Cuba, illegal hunters also target the crocodile for its hide.

The Robertson-Browns rode around the mangrove swamp in a small boat driven by guide Gustavo, allowing them to capture images both in and out of the water

Niño is an American crocodile, which are widely distributed across the Caribean, largely in shallow waters such as those in Jardines de la Reina
