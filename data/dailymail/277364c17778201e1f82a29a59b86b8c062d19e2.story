Stoke City players were incensed when referee Michael Oliver denied them what appeared to be a stonewall penalty against Manchester United, despite having a clear view of the incident.

As Potters striker Peter Crouch headed the ball on, Chris Smalling could be seen lifting his arm as the ball struck him on the way through.

Referee Oliver was in a good position to see the incident clearly, but made the decision to refrain from awarding a spot kick.

After the match, speaking to Sky Sports, Crouch said of the incident: 'It was a yard ahead of me, my header was on target. Smalling had his hands up and for me, it was a definite penalty.' 

Stoke manager Mark Hughes added: ‘Chris Smalling has lost Peter Crouch on the initial header and is just trying to get something in the way of the ball. It’s a goal-bound header and he’s made an intentional movement with his arm to bat the ball down.

‘The referee is clearly standing there four or five yards away so why he hasn’t given it I don’t know.

‘It’s a waste of time (speaking to Oliver about it). I’m sure he will say something like the lad couldn’t get out of the way because he was so close but I don’t think that’s the case.'

At the time of the incident, Stoke were level with Manchester United, who equalised through Radamel Falcao.

The home side had gone 1-0 up after just two minutes, and were looking to hold on for an invaluable point against Louis van Gaal's men. 

They managed to keep the scores level at 1-1, leaving them in 10th place ahead of the 3pm kick-offs in the Premier League. Manchester United remain third.

It was a quiet game for Michael Oliver. The only real talking point was the penalty for the Chris Smalling handball.

His arms were up in an unnatural position, so it should have been a penalty.

Manchester United have certainly had a lucky Christmas in terms of penalties awarded against them, with the Stoke incident the clearest of three. 

United had one given against them versus Newcastle on Boxing Day, but there should have been another earlier in the game at Old Trafford, when Juan Mata tripped Yoan Gouffran. 

At White Hart Lane two days later, Wayne Rooney clearly held Harry Kane toward the end of the game as a corner was taken, but appeals were waved away.

Louis van Gaal's side are riding their luck.
