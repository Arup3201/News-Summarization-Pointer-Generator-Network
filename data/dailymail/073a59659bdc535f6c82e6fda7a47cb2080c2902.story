An Ohio teenager convicted in a Korean War veteran's killing has been ordered to spend the anniversary of the slaying in solitary confinement for as long as he's in prison.

Seventeen-year-old Jordan Legg was sentenced to life in prison in the death of 84-year-old Thomas 'Shorty' Whitson in Orient.

For at least one day a year, Legg will be pulled from his own prison cell and sent along to a place far more desolate and lonely: solitary confinement.

 He won't be eligible for parole for at least 20 years.

Legg pleaded guilty yesterday to a charge of aggravated murder for his role in the death of Whitson, who was shot to death as he slept in his favorite chair in the living room of his rural  home earlier this year.

The judge ordered that as long as Legg is in prison, he will spend every March 30 — the anniversary of the murder — in isolation, left with nothing but his own thoughts about what he did, the damage he wrought and the lives he wrecked. 

Authorities say Legg was in a group that included Whitson's grandson who killed the farmer because they wanted to sell his guns for drug money.

Pickaway County Common Pleas Judge P. Randall Knece told Legg he should be kept in isolation every March 30 to be alone with the thoughts of what he did.

Legg, who had no relatives or friends with him in the courtroom, turned to the Whitsons and apologized. He said drugs ruined his life and now he realizes that he ruined others’, too. 

 He said he hopes the family can forgive him someday.

The teen was part of a group of five who went to Whitson’s house about 1:30 a.m. that March night. 

Shaun Lawson, Whitson’s 30-year-old grandson, was the triggerman; he admitted he killed his grandfather with Whitson’s own .357 Magnum handgun.

A jury convicted Lawson last month of aggravated murder and related charges. Knece sentenced him to life in prison.

Whitson's grandson received life with no chance of parole.
