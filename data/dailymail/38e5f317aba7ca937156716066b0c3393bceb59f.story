A pub landlord arrested by police investigating the disappearance of Claudia Lawrence declared: 'I didn't kill her and I didn't have an affair with her'.

Paul Harris, 46, who runs The Acomb pub in York, spoke out after he was released on bail after being questioned on suspicion of perverting the course of justice in connection with the hunt for the 35-year-old chef.

He said: 'I know everyone is saying that I either murdered Claudia or I had an affair with Claudia, but that's not true.

'I just feel for Claudia's family.  This sort of thing must give them false hope.'

Search: As Mr Harris was questioned on Wednesday, detectives searched his pub, his van and his car

The publican told 5 News his children were reduced to tears after he was arrested and his pub searched by detectives from North Yorkshire Police investigating the case of the York University chef who disappeared on her way to work in March 2009.

'People have been texting my children asking "Did your dad kill Claudia Lawrence?"  My kids have been in tears, my wife has been in tears all night,' he said.

He said Ms Lawrence had visited his pub two weeks before she went missing, but said it was the first time she'd been there for years as she had starting frequenting another local pub, The Nag's Head, instead.  

Mr Harris, who has run the pub in the west of York, three miles from where Ms Lawrence lived, for 11 years, said: 'The police have told me I was arrested because a woman came forward recently saying something that contradicted what I said in a statement taken at the time Claudia went missing.

'I can't say who it is who came forward, or what was in the statement, but what I can say is that I volunteered to give the police a statement at the time.

'I gave my DNA, I've got nothing to hide.'

He said the police were not questioning him in relation to Ms Lawrence's disappearance in 2009 but because of a discrepancy between something she said and something he said in his statement at the time.

Mr Harris added: 'I've got nothing to hide, I've done nothing wrong. I just feel for her family because this sort of thing must give them false hope'. 

Mr Harris said his arrest on Wednesday reduced his two children to tears but added: 'I've done nothing wrong'

Police hunt: Detectives and forensics undertook a detailed search of Mr Harris' York pub, basement and garden

 He said police had searched his pub, his van and his wife's car, but not their family home, adding: 'They've made a right mess at the pub.'

The publican said detectives had dug up a large slab of concrete in the pub's basement, and accused police of wanting 'to look like they're doing something'.

He added: 'There's so much interest in this story that making arrests makes it look like they're getting somewhere.

'They've gone upstairs where I've been renovating rooms and made a mess up there, searching around. I've got about 12 doors which have been stripped of paint and they've taken two of them away.

'Why would you take them away? They've been stripped so won't have any DNA on them.' 

Mr Harris, who said he had displayed a 'Missing Claudia Lawrence' poster in his pub window  to help with the search, said: 'Claudia came into the pub once in the two years before she went missing.

'She was with people who are friends of mine - they're still friends now.  I didn't know her any more than that, and the cops know that.'

He said: 'I just feel for Claudia's family, for her poor dad - I'm a dad myself. I've always told the police everything I know. I hope anyone out there with information who has not spoken yet will come forward - it's not too late'.

North Yorkshire Police have yet to comment about Mr Harris' claims.

Ms Lawrence, who lived in Heworth, York, was last seen by colleagues at the University of York on the afternoon of March 18, 2009 when she finished her shift.

She spoke to her parents, Peter and Joan, on the telephone that evening but has not been seen since despite a huge police hunt.
