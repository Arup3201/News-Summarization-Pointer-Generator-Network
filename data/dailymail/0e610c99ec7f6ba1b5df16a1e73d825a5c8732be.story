A Minnesota doctor was shot and killed on Friday by a man he helped deliver 30 years ago.

Dr Stephen Larson, 74, of Orono, was found dead inside his home Friday night from multiple gunshot wounds, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner said Sunday.

The suspect, who was shot dead by police at the scene of the doctor's killing, was identified as 30-year-old Ted Hoffstrom, of St. Anthony, Minnesota.

According to ABC News, the long-time Minneapolis obstetrician and gynecologist had assisted in the birth of Hoffstrom in 1983, but authorities have yet to give a possible motive for the killing.

Officers responded just before 9pm on Friday to a report of an armed man outside Larson's home on the 1000 block of Heritage Lane.

Shots were fired during a confrontation and the suspect was killed outside the home, the Hennepin County Sheriff's Office said. 

Larson was killed before police arrived on the scene and his body was found inside the home, authorities said.

Crime scene: It is alleged that Larson went to the doctor's house and shot him. The suspect was then shot dead by police outside the home in Orono, Minnesota

The doctor was home alone at the time of the shooting as his wife was out of town, according to the ABC.

During his 33-year career, colleagues at OBGYN Specialists in Edina and Burnsville estimated he delivered thousands of babies and won numerous awards.

‘There is no way there is anyone who would have any ill will towards him,’ said one of Larson's partners at OBGYN Specialists, Dr Suzin Cho.

The alleged killer’s family posted a note on the front door of their home Sunday, asking people to respect their privacy as they grieve for their son.

The aspiring lawyer had recently passed the Minnesota bar exam, according to St. Paul Pioneer Press.

His family said his actions were shocking and out of character.

‘It is with great sadness that we extend our heartfelt prayers and sympathy to the family of Dr. Stephen Larson. Our hearts are broken for all of those affected by this tragic event, said the note from the Hoffstrom family. 

‘We are shocked and saddened by this news, and many questions remain unanswered. We hope that the public will understand this is a very difficult time for our family.

'We are grieving the loss of our son, and ask that you please respect our privacy at this time.’
