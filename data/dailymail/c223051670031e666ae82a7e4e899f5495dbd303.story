The New York bodega where six-year-old Etan Patz was allegedly lured to his death in 1979 has been described as a 'safe haven' by residents - maybe the reason it was never thoroughly searched in the original investigation.

The youngster's best friend, Chelsea Altman, said the store at 448 West Broadway in Soho was a spot where parents felt comfortable letting their children roam unaccompanied, adding that it was a 'friendly place'.

On May 25, 1979 Etan's mother waved him off with a dollar bill in his hand to get a soda from the store before catching the school bus, but he never emerged after prosecutors say he was taken to the basement by stock clerk Pedro Hernandez and strangled to death.

Ramon Rodriguez, 75, told a Manhattan court on Thursday that Pedros Hernandez, left, admitted to the kidnapping and murder of Etan Patz, right, on a 1979 religious retreat in New Jersey

While records show police went to the bodega among many places during their search for Etan, a detective testified earlier this week that he couldn't remember the space being searched.

The owners have since died. So has the lead detective.

And when the bodega closed in the early 1980s, a cleaning company came and stripped away everything. It is a now a high-end eye  wear boutique.

Commenting on the apparent murder scene, Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzi-Orbon said: 'It's ironic and particularly tragic that this was the place that turned out to be the most dangerous for a child.'

The bodega was depicted as a cramped oasis of household necessities in an area of ramshackle warehouses and vacant lots.

Its narrow aisles were crammed with soda, beer, candy and household supplies.

Sometimes a live rooster perched on the counter, residents recalled. 

Just a day before Etan disappeared, another neighborhood mother found the lunch box he'd forgotten at the school bus stop and dropped it off at the store, asking counter worker Juan Santana to mind it until he could pick it up.

Santana was a guy everyone in the neighborhood knew. 

But no one knew that his brother-in-law, Hernandez, would become the suspect in Etan's death more than three decades later, after giving a confession his defense now says was fiction produced by mental illness. 

Hernandez, 54, of Maple Shade, New Jersey, has pleaded not guilty to murder and kidnapping.

Santana, who isn't a suspect, has become a confounding witness during testimony this week. 

A look back: In this March 1980 photo, Stan and Julie Patz stand on the  fire escape of their loft in SoHo. Below them runs Prince Street, along which Etan, their six-year-old son, set off to school on May 25, 1979

Many of his answers didn't match others' remembrances, and ADA Illuzi-Orbon even warned jurors that Santana - who got Hernandez his $200-a-week job at the bodega - was worried about protecting himself and would not be cooperative.

Santana, 66, testified that he remembered Etan picking up the lunch box the day before his disappearance, but he doesn't recall whether Hernandez ever spoke to him.

And Santana said he didn't remember whether Hernandez was allowed alone into the store basement, where Hernandez said in videotaped confessions that he lured Etan by promising a soda, then choked him. 

In the confessions, Hernandez said he put the boy, still alive, in a bag, boxed it and left it with curbside trash.

Etan's body has never been found. No one has testified, at least so far, that they saw Hernandez with the boy.

Some records from the lengthy investigation are missing, and it's not clear why the shop never emerged as a prime spot until Hernandez' surprising 2012 confession.

His defense hinges on convincing jurors that the confession is false, along with suggesting that the real killer may be a convicted Pennsylvania child molester who was a prime suspect for years.

In considering evidence that reaches back to 1979, jurors will delve into a missing-child case that helped inject a new protectiveness into American parenting.

Etan became one of the first missing children featured on milk cartons. 

His parents, Stan and Julie, helped advocate for legislation that created a nationwide law enforcement framework to address such cases, and the anniversary of his disappearance became National Missing Children's Day.

The trial is expected to last up to three months. 

In addition to Etan's mother, witnesses are expected to include psychologists, an inmate informant who knows Hernandez, and possibly other informants testifying against the earlier suspect.
