A New York City businessman who once brawled with Monaco's Prince Pierre Casiraghi has been banned from the tiny seaside kingdom.

Adam Hock pleaded guilty to socking Princess Grace's grandson in the jaw in the 2012 Meatpacking District dust-up, so when he arrived in Monaco via yacht in May he thought everything was on the up and up.

Hock soon learned he was wrong. Prince Albert himself, still sore from the 'Battle Royale' embarrassment, ordered the financier to stay out of the country just after he'd arrived.

Royal pain: New York businessman Adam Hock arrived in Monaco with friends in late May and was told that Prince Albert himself had banned him from the tiny kingdom because of his infamous 2012 dust up with Princess Grace's son--and Monaco prince--Pierre Casiraghi

Page Six said the ban immediately became the hot topic of the ritzy riviera town.

'The incident was the talk of Naomi Campbell’s birthday at the Billionaire Club in Monte Carlo, which Adam was supposed to attend, on May 23,' revealed the Page Six source.

Adam reportedly arrived in Monaco from Cannes with his friend, Cirque du Soleil CEO Guy LaLiberte.

Hock would not be allowed back into Monaco, 'on the orders of Prince Albert,' reports Page Six, despite the pleas his wealthy friends would make on his behalf.

'[Adam’s friends] had to take his belongings off the yacht, which remained in Monaco, while Adam went on to Ibiza,' said the source.

Adam Hock agreed to plead guilty to 
disorderly conduct in the year-long legal saga that began at Manhattan's
 Double Seven Club in 2012.

When
 Casiraghi and his two friends filed a lawsuit against the Double Seven 
Club and Hock, both parties responded by blaming the prince and his 
entourage for starting the fight in February of that year.

Battle Royale: Prince Pierre Casiraghi (pictured here with Beatrice Borromeo in March) accused Hock in 2012 of drunkenly punching him in Manhattan's trendy Double Seven Club. Hock initially blamed Casiraghi and company as the aggressors but eventually pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct

In reply papers filed in Manhattan Supreme Court, Hock claimed that Casiraghi, art dealer Vladimir Restoin Roitfeld and banker Diego Marroquin were the aggressors in the violence in a VIP area in the early hours of February 18, 2012.

According to the New York Post, Hock said in the paper the three young men were helping themselves to his vodka and were jealous because they were with women the young men were interested in.

He said the trio were 'visibly intoxicated' and attacked him in an 'unprovoked and unjustified assault'.

The club owner was also named in the 
suit, with Hock alleging that Jeffrey Jah should have been keeping a 
closer eye on the prince and his friends because they have a reputation 
for such 'violent, belligerent and disruptive tendencies'.

The
 prince's lawsuit said the club, in Manhattan's Meatpacking District, 
shouldn't have served alcohol to Mr Hock, a former owner of Times Square
 nightspot Hawaiian Tropic Zone, and should have known he was a fighter,
 or 'a person of pugilistic propensity'.

We are not amused: Prince Albert reportedly personally banished Hock from his glitzy kingdom

Patrons who witnessed the incident 
said Prince Pierre, who was quaffing $500 bottles of champagne with his 
entourage, which included Paris Hilton's ex-boyfriend Stravros Niarchos,
 was 'jealous' of Mr Hock because he was sitting with a woman he was 
interested in.

After 
approaching their table, Mr Hock punched the prince and sent him flying 
into a table on the other side of the room, where he landed with blood 
pouring from his face.

Hock was arrested and charged with four counts of assault against Casiraghi and a number of his friends.

Hock initially pleaded not guilty but finally agreed to enter a guilty plea in February 2013.

He
 was sentenced to 12 weeks of anger management classes and 10 days 
community service. Afterwards, prosecutors said they'd drop any criminal
 charges from his record.

Sorry/Not sorry: Hock, seen here with his arm in a sling following the February 2012 brawl, initially fought the prince's charges, but royalty trumped the American's financial heft in this case--Hock agreed to plead guilty and serve a community service sentence in 2013
