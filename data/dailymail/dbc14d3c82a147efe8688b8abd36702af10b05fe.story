Tourists have developed a real ‘taste for travel’ in recent years - with international foods the top product to bring back home.

British Airways has compiled the most popular foodstuffs holidaymakers bring home from the 200 countries that they operate within.

American sweets Hershey's Kisses and Peanut M&M's take the first and third spots, respectively, with Turkish delight also making the top three.

Popular treat: Holidaymakers to the US frequently bring Hershey's Kisses back home with them

Tayto’s Cheese & Onion Crisps (Ireland), Chianti wine (Italy), Tunnock's Tea Cakes (Scotland), The Chocolate Block wine (South Africa), Tim Tam biscuits (Australia), Oliveira da Serra Gourmet Olive Oil (Portugal) and Mount Gay Rum from the Caribbean complete the top 10 foods taken home.

America

The United States is home to our favourite sugary treats. For comedy value, Butterfinger, Whoppers and Milk Duds are popular gifts, along with favourites - Peanut M&Ms, Ghirardelli chocolate, Twizzlers, Hershey’s, Jolly Ranchers and Reese’s Pieces.

Despite the space they take up in luggage, cereals Lucky Charms and Froot Loops are also top buys.

Caribbean

One rum punch and you’re converted, so it’s no surprise that Mount Gay Rum and Tortuga Rum Cake are favourite Caribbean treats to bring back.

Local Banks Beer, Bajan Hot Sauce, and dry jerk rub are also popular goods from Barbados, Grenada, Antigua and Jamaica.

Ireland

No trip to Ireland is complete without sampling the local white pudding, soda bread and cheese and onion Tayto’s crisps, washed down with Guinness. While stocking up on rations, visitors also shop for Paddy’s Whiskey and Bailey’s Irish Cream.

France

Cheese and wine are two of the most popular goods that holidaymakers bring back from France. Wines from the Burgundy, Champagne and Bordeaux regions are the most popular, accompanied with Camembert, Brie and Roquefort cheese.

Portugal

Piri Piri sauce, Oliveira da Serra Gourmet Olive Oil and local Port are among Portugal’s best-selling tourist souvenirs.

Irresistable: Tim Tam chocolate biscuits are popular with visitors to Australia

Italy

Italy is the top destination for foodies in Europe, with Lemoncello, Panatone, Balsamic vinegar, olive-oil, dried pasta (particularly in different colours) and Chianti.

Marrakech

Visitors come to Marrakech for its markets and souks, providing culinary and household goods at a fraction of the cost. Saffron, cinnamon and Argan Oil are the most popular.

Dubai

Middle Eastern goods, including stuffed dates, almonds, cashew nuts and baklava are so popular that they are available in extra-large packs at the airport.

Japan

Visitors to Japan stock up on sake and Asahi beer, while those with adventurous palates also include miso soup stock, umeboshi (pickled fruits) and katsuobushi (dried fish flakes).

Sumptuous Scottish treat: Tunnock's teacakes

India

Depending where you travel to, foods can vary greatly. However, some of the staples that travellers tend to bring back include Bombay mix, cardamom seeds and local sweet barfi.

China

China is set to become one of the most popular tourist destinations in the next ten years, and some of the unusual foods travellers bring home include Lay’s cucumber crisps, soy sauce and ground Szechuan pepper.

Australia

As any expat will tell you, Tim Tams, Fantales, Cherry Ripe bars and Vegemite are iconic foods from the homeland as well as the top foods to bring back from Down Under.

Claire Bentley, managing director of British Airways Holidays, said: ‘One of the great pleasures of travelling is sampling new and exciting foods. 

'Travel food programmes on TV have inspired many of us to visit food markets and try local dishes when abroad.

‘We associate happy memories with holidays, and being able to relive these, even for just a few pleasurable moment with a glass of Chianti, or slice of rum cake, can transport us back to our holiday instantly.’

BA wine buyer Andy Sparrow said: ‘Food and travel go together like cheese and wine. 

'There’s definitely a growing interest in visiting the providence of where produce comes from and Argentina, France, Italy, South Africa and USA are the best destinations for wine lovers.’

The most loved British foods that people take on holiday include marmalade, Cadbury's Dairy Milk Buttons, Harrods Earl Grey tea, HP tomato ketchup, Weetabix, Jaffa Cakes, Newcastle Brown Ale, Marmite and digestive biscuits.

As with all travel, customers should check UK customs regulations for the latest guidelines on goods that can be brought into the country.
