With its snow-white coat and bright pink ears, this albino kangaroo stands out in stark contrast to its grey-coloured relatives.

The rare animal, believed to be two years old, was spotted roaming bushland near Canberra, Australia.

It has stunned wildlife experts - with albino kangaroos usually expected to die very young.

The marsupials' startling white coats are believed to attract a higher number of predators, including wild foxes, dogs and even eagles.

Meanwhile, albino kangaroos are also more likely to develop skin cancer and sunburn, as well as having a genetic predisposition towards sight and hearing difficulties, according to The Canberra Times.

The adorable animal, believed to be an eastern grey kangaroo, was spotted by a ranger at Namadgi National Park, 25 miles southwest of Canberra, last weekend.

It is believed to be female, and has been nicknamed 'Renee' by staff at the 106,000-hectare park.

Ranger Brett McNamara told The Canberra Times he was surprised the albino kangaroo had survived for so long in the wild.

'Grey kangaroos are grey for a reason — they blend in with the rest of the environment,' he said.

However, he said the animal’s close proximity to its family may have helped to protect it from potential dangers - adding: 'They do form very close-knit mobs within that valley'.

Park rangers have refused to disclose the kangaroo's exact location - fearing that illegal hunters might view the rare creature as a prize souvenir.

'We are concerned about its ongoing welfare because of some illegal hunting activities that do occur in the park,' said Mr McNamara.

Albinism - characterised by a lack of the pigment melanin - is extremely rare within the kangaroo species, similar to other species.
