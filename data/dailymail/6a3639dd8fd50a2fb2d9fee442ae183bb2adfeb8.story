Doctors are hailing a drug that can delay the progress of cervical cancer – the most common cancer affecting young women.

Trials show that Avastin can extend the lives of women with advanced cervical cancer by 30 per cent compared with chemotherapy.

Using the drug led to overall survival of 17 months compared to 13.3 months and almost half of patients responded to treatment.

Cancer victim: Jade Goody leaving The Royal Marsden Hospital in London in March 2009

Cervical cancer is the most common cancer in women aged 35 and under and kills about 1,000 people in the UK every year.

It is treated with surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy and if diagnosed and treated early the outlook is good.

But for patients who are diagnosed when their cancer is at a more advanced stage, it becomes more difficult to treat and a cure is unlikely.

Reality TV star Jade Goody died in 2009 aged 27, just months after being diagnosed with the disease.

Avastin, which is also known as bevacizumab, is already widely used in patients with colon cancer.

It was launched last year for use in ovarian cancer after trials showed it could delay the progress of the disease by six months.

The latest study involves a trial sponsored by the US National Cancer Institute. In total, 452 women in the U.S. and Spain were recruited for the trial, which compared Avastin with standard chemotherapy, and in combination with chemo.

Professor Stan Kaye, head of clinical studies at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said: 'The improvements in overall survival achieved for women with advanced cervical cancer treated with Avastin are extremely encouraging.'

Robert Music, of Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust, added: 'The results of this research look promising.'

The trial showed a higher level of side effects in the group of women taking Avastin, including blood clots and high blood pressure.

Roche, the maker of Avastin, was not involved in the trial.
