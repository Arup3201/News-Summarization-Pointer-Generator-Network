Four members of a family died in a fire after arsonists targeted the wrong house following the fatal stabbing of a fitness coach, a court has heard.

Jurors trying two defendants accused of murdering Antoin Akpom were told the victims of the blaze had no connection with him or his alleged killers.

Abdul Hakim and Hussain Hussain deny murdering Mr Akpom, who was stabbed in Leicester around seven hours before the alleged arson attack which killed Shehnila Taufiq, her daughter Zainab, 19, and sons Bilal, 17, and Jamil, 15.

Victim: Antoin Akpom, who was found stabbed in a Leicester street in September. A house just yards from the family home of one of his alleged killers burned down in the hours after the attack, killing four

Loss: The alleged arson attack killed Shehnila Taufiq, her daughter Zainab, 19, and sons Bilal, 17, and Jamil, 15

Opening the Crown’s case against the two men, prosecutor Richard Latham QC said the Taufiqs’ home in Wood Hill, Leicester, was two doors away from an address occupied by Mr Hakim’s mother.

Mr Akpom, 20, died in hospital after suffering a collapsed lung in Kent Street, Leicester, at about 5.30pm on September 12 last year.

Explaining the background to the deaths to a jury at Stafford Crown Court, Mr Latham said: 'Mr Akpom was pronounced dead just before 7 o’clock that evening.

'At half past midnight that night - five-and-a-half hours after Akpom had died - there was an arson attack outside the front door of a family who lived in Leicester - but two doors away from Hakim’s mother’s home.

'The fire caused the deaths of the four occupants of the home.'

Urging the jury not to speculate about evidence due to be heard at a separate trial connected to the fire, Mr Latham added: 'The tragedy was that the occupants had nothing to do with the incident in Kent Street, nothing to do with Akpom.

'Whoever did this - if it had anything to do with the stabbing - got the wrong house.

'Those alleged to be responsible for that fire will be tried by another jury in another Crown Court in a few weeks’ time. It has no bearing on what happened in Kent Street on the evening of September 12.'

Mr Akpom was stabbed around half an hour after leaving a Leicester primary school where he helped to run a dance class.

The father-of-one is alleged to have been attacked near a gym after a confrontation with Mr Hakim and Mr Hussain, who are both 19.

It was apparent from the evidence in the case, Mr Latham said, that there was 'some sort of bad feeling' between Mr Akpom and Mr Hakim, which seemed to have been going on for about a year.

During the Crown’s opening of the case, jurors were asked to view still images from CCTV cameras, including some showing Mr Akpom with his back to the camera after he had been stabbed.

Mr Akpom was described by his friend Joe French as 'an all-round great guy and a great role model'

Further images recorded on a passing bus showed Hussain and Hakim, of Wood Hill, Leicester, running from Kent Street towards Humberstone Road after the alleged murder.

Mr Latham said it was accepted by the defence that both defendants were involved in the incident, but what they had done at the scene was in dispute.

CCTV footage recovered from premises in the Kent Street area showed Mr Akpom getting out of the passenger seat of a Fiat Punto to confront his alleged killers.

The Crown alleges Mr Hussain, of no fixed address, inflicted the fatal stab wound after punches were thrown by all three men during an altercation in the street.

Outlining the evidence against the defendants, Mr Latham said CCTV images showed the moments immediately before and after the stabbing.

Mr Latham told jurors that CCTV cameras had also captured the car Mr Akpom was travelling in as it approached the defendants, who were on foot in Kent Street.

Describing the extent of the CCTV footage to the jury, Mr Latham added: 'Frustratingly, although there are several cameras, the precise place where the stabbing happened is not covered by a camera.

'Immediately before and seconds after (the stabbing) you will have images, but from the critical period where the stabbing occurred, there is no image.'

Witness Joe French told the court he had been close friends with Mr Akpom since they were 12-years-old.

He
 described his friend, who he ran a coaching business with, as 'an 
all-round great guy' who was 'a great friend and a great role model'.

Mr French told the court he saw Mr Akpom running towards him moments after being stabbed.

Mr French told the court he saw Mr Akpom running towards him moments after being stabbed. He said: 'He put his arm around me and I put my arm on his back and there was a lot of blood. I realised he had been stabbed'

Giving
 evidence, he said: 'He put his arm around me and I put my arm on his 
back and there was a lot of blood. I realised he had been stabbed.

'I took my jacket off, took my top off and I held the blood in with my top and laid him down on the floor.

'I
 was informed an ambulance had already been rang so I rang Amber, his 
girlfriend, and told her Antoin had been hurt and to get to the gym.

'I threw my car keys to somebody and said ‘go and bring my car’ because I didn’t want to leave Antoin on the floor.

'I was going to take him to the hospital. As soon as the car was near, police had blocked the road off.'

The court heard Mr Hakim and Mr Hussain travelled to London after the stabbing and arrived at an address in Enfield just before midnight on September 12.

The pair then ordered two taxis using the name ‘Jonathan’ at lunchtime the next day and separated.

But Mr Hakim - who told the driver to take him to King’s Cross station - was arrested by a British Transport Police officer outside the drop off point for St Pancras railway station at 5.25pm on September 13.

The court heard Mr Hussain asked to be taken to his mother’s address in London.

He then went inside the house and returned to the taxi with a large brown envelope - which the driver said contained a large quality of cash believed to be between £3,000 and £4,000.

The court heard he told the taxi driver he was wanted by police and said he was going abroad for a couple of months.

Mr Hussain was taken to Stanstead Airport in the taxi and made his way to the EasyJet travel desk before asking for a flight to Amsterdam.

But the jury were told he didn’t have a passport or travel visa on him so was told the only place he could travel to was Scotland.

He dismissed that idea and stayed at a hotel in Ilford before paying £200 in cash to get a taxi to Cardiff in South Wales the next day.

The court heard he was arrested by a police officer 16 days later in Cardiff on September 29.

Both men gave no comment answers in police interviews but blamed each other for the stabbing in pre-prepared statements.

The trial continues.
