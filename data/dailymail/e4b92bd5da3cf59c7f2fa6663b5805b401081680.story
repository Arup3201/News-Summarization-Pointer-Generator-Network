A stunning property in a complex where Christine Keeler - the woman involved in one of the biggest sleaze scandals to rock Britain - was imprisoned has gone on sale for £650,000.

Hill Hall, which is regarded as one of the country’s most important Elizabethan houses, was used as a women’s jail in the 1960s and 1970s.

And the Profumo Affair’s temptress Keeler, a model who had an affair with war minister John Profumo aged 19 in 1961, was its most famous prisoner.

Mansion: Hill Hall, which is regarded as one of the country's most important Elizabethan houses, was originally built for Sir Thomas Smith between 1567 and 1575

Up for grabs: A stunning home, in the Northern Wing (pictured), has now been put on the market with estate agents Stevenette & Co for £600,000

Impressive home: There is an entrance hall, living room, kitchen and breakfast room, dining room, three/four bedrooms and two bathrooms

Keeler, who was also seeing Russian military attache Yevgeny Ivanov, was found guilty of unrelated perjury charges and jailed for nine months in 1963.

The mansion where she was held was built for Sir Thomas Smith between 1567 and 1575.

The
 Smith family held onto the mansion near Epping, Essex, until the 
mid-19th century - and it was used as a Second World War prisoner of war
 camp.

The stately home was devastated by fire in the 1970s with developers later restoring and converting it into private houses.

'It is rare to find an opportunity to live not only in part of a magnificent Elizabethan Grade I listed mansion but also one with such a colourful history'

There is an entrance hall, living room, kitchen and breakfast room, dining room, three/four bedrooms and two bathrooms.

Mandy Stevenette, from Stevenette & Co, said: ‘It is rare to find an opportunity to live not only in part of a magnificent Elizabethan Grade I listed mansion but also one with such a colourful history.

‘The property, which is the converted northern service wing of Hill Hall itself, has its own courtyard garden as well as benefiting from gated communal gardens of some 20 acres.’

The Profumo Affair happened at the height
 of the Cold War when it was discovered that Keeler had been sleeping 
with both Profumo and Ivanov.

Scandal: Former war minister John Profumo (left) had an affair with Christine Keeler in 1961 while she was also seeing Russian military attache Yevgeny Ivanov

Keeler and Profumo began their affair after being introduced at a party at the Cliveden estate in 1961 by their mutual friend Stephen Ward.

Profumo, who was married to actress Valerie Hobson, had no idea that Keeler was also sleeping with Ivanov.

In March 1963 he told the House of Commons that rumours of his affair were untrue. But he was forced to resign three months later after admitting lying.

Ward, who was prosecuted for living off immoral earnings, took an overdose the day before his trial ended and died in August 1963.
