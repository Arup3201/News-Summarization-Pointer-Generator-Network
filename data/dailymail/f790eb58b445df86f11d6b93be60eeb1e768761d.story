The last decade has seen a huge rise in the popularity of Dress Down Fridays and Casual Work Environments, where people ditch suits in favour of comfier clothing. 

But this new clothing trend could be damaging your career.  

New research shows that almost half of the population still judge their colleagues based on the smartness of their work attire.  

A new poll has shown that 40 per cent of office workers look down on a colleague that wears short skirts (left), while 70 per cent of people judge an employee for wearing ripped jeans in the workplace 

The decision about whether to wear a tie or a shift dress also matters far more in different areas. 

In a survey of 2000 people, Welsh office workers were the most critical in the UK, with 50 per cent of those polled admitting that they judged people on their work wardrobe.

Meanwhile, people from the East Midlands were much more laid back in their attitude to office attire, with only 37.7 per cent of people polled having any interest in how their colleagues dressed for work. 

The South West and Northern Ireland were similarly disinterested, with roughly 38 per cent of both areas admitting they judged people on their appearance. 

But while there was a big gap between opinions on general work clothing between different areas, one element most people managed to agree on were the biggest fashion no-go's for an office.

Sir Alan Sugar was voted as the British celebrity who dresses most appropriately for the office, while interior designer Kelly Hoppen came a close second 

The research, commissioned by the Business is GREAT campaign showed 70 per cent of people would look down on a colleague if they wore ripped jeans to work, while 51 per cent of people are critical of people who would wear a branded T-shirt.

And it's bad news for the mini-skirt - 40 per cent of people believe a woman wearing a mini-skirt is less effective at her job. 

Anyone struggling to decide on a style that would secure them a promotion are advised to look towards Sir Alan Sugar - The Apprentice star was named as the most appropriately dressed office worker, with the interior designer Kelly Hoppen and Dragons Den star Peter Jones coming a close second and third.
