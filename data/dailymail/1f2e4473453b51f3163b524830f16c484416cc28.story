Steffon Armitage has publicly supported Toulon team-mate Martin Castrogiovanni after his expletive-laden rant aimed at Leicester Tigers' director of rugby Richard Cockerill.

Armitage cheekily requested t-shirts on Twitter from Rugby Dump which spelt out part of Castrogiovanni's attack on Cockerill last Sunday with a silhouette of the Italian above the words: 'Love me or hate me ... I don't hate anyone. Peace and love. I just don't like ****s'.

Toulon lock Ali Williams joined Armitage in praising Castrogiovanni’s actions and replied on Twitter ‘I am definitely wearing one tomorrow’.

The French side fell to a 25-21 defeat at Leicester on Sunday during the fiercely fought European Rugby Champions Cup pool three clash but Castrogiovanni clearly had unresolved issues on his mind.

The prop lashed out at Cockerill in a press conference and slammed the East Midlands club for the way they dealt with his move to Toulon in June 2013 after spending seven seasons with Leicester.

'I thought f****** Leicester were f****** amateur,' said Castrogiovanni. 'He was saying that people go for the money but he has a lot of f****** squad players who get paid as well. I paid my own f****** money to leave this club. I don't need the money to play rugby. I love this game and I used to love this club.

'I still love this club but I never want to speak with Cockers any more. I am not fake. If I hate you, if you have been a ****, I will never speak to you again. I don't hate anyone. Peace and love. I just don't like ****s.'

Reigning European champions Toulon have apologised for Castrogiovanni's five-minute rant which Cockerill has branded petulant. The Italian was infuriated by claims from Leicester that he left Welford Road last summer in search of a pay rise.

'I never had the opportunity to defend myself when I left,' added the 33-year-old prop.

Tigers coach Cockerill is dismayed by the comments and claims they have sullied Castrogiovanni's standing

'Cockers talks about the money, but the real reason I left this club is because you have Cole and you have me. Cole paid gets paid half the money from the RFU and I am foreign.

'You have a good f****** tighthead prop playing for England and a hairy, fat Italian. The thing is that they made it look like I went for the money but I paid £100,000 from my pocket to leave this club because I want to play rugby. That's it.'

Toulon have also said they are investigating Steffon's brother Delon, with claims suggesting the full-back threatened to 'take the face off' a Leicester supporter during the half-time break on Sunday.

With the Armitages and Castrogiovanni currently all available for Saturday's clash in Toulon against the Tigers, it could add an extra edge to an already intriguing heavyweight clash.
