A never-seen-before archive of evidence compiled by Sherlock Holmes author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle when he turned sleuth to solve a real-life mystery has emerged for sale for £40,000.

Conan Doyle followed in the footsteps of his most famous creation Dr Holmes when in 1906 he began investigating the peculiar case of George Edalji.

The fascinating story, portrayed in the 2005 Julian Barnes novel Arthur and George, is set to hit television screens on Monday night, with Martin Clunes starring as Conan Doyle in the ITV drama.

The tale starts as George Edalji, a solicitor from Birmingham, is handed seven years' hard labour in 1903 after being found guilty of a series of mutilation attacks horses around the rural village of Great Wyrley, Staffs, where his father was the vicar.

Edalji, aged 27 at the time, had been accused of wounding the horses under the cover of darkness then writing threatening anonymous letters to police, charges he always contested.

His conviction caused public outrage with more than 10,000 people, including criminal lawyers, protesting it.

Among the most high profile supporters of the protest was Conan Doyle, who at the time was among the most celebrated writers in the country.

Conan Doyle became convinced that Edalji was innocent after meeting in him in a hotel lobby in 1906 on his release from prison.

Noticing how bad Edalji's eyesight was, he concluded it would have been impossible for someone with such poor vision to carry out the crimes at night.

In a style akin to his most famous character, Sherlock Holmes, Conan Doyle set about logically compiling reams of evidence in a bid to disprove Edalji's guilt and see him pardoned.

The writer became more and more obsessed with the case, bombarding Staffordshire police chief Captain George Anson with daily letters putting forward evidence he had gathered from crime scenes and from forensics experts.

Conan Doyle, a doctor before taking up writing, also offered his advice to experts in the case.

In one letter to the veterinary surgeon who had examined the mutilated horses Conan Doyle suggested he 'examine the wounds upon the horses from the point of view that they are caused by a very large horse-lancet... The invariable long wound suggests an instrument which cannot stab, having a blount [sic] end'.

The legendary author, who invented Sherlock Holmes 1887, offered his own list of suspects, eventually pointing the finger at villager Royden Sharp, and suggested witnesses who should be interviewed by police to back up his findings.

In a letter to Capt Anson suggesting he investigate Sharp, Conan Doyle wrote: 'I am convinced he was concerned in some of the earlier outrages... [he is] fiendishly cunning.'

He added: 'Colour prejudice may have been enough to prompt them [the Sharp brothers] to bait the Edalji family in the cruel way they did... The man's own relatives admit that he has times of dangerous mania.'

The writer's efforts in clearing Edalji's name were depicted in a 2005 novel by English author Julian Barnes. 

The book was turned into a television series, with Martin Clunes playing Arthur Conan Doyle and Arsher Ali playing Edalji - set to be aired on Monday.

In May 1907 as direct result of Conan Doyle's work an inquiry into the case was opened and concluded with Edalji being officially pardoned.

Capt Anson however remained convinced of Edalji's guilt and refused to investigate any other leads, including looking into Royden Sharp.

In sheer frustration, Conan Doyle wrote: 'I never thought my Case...was good enough for a prosecution... [but]...to say that there is 'absolutely nothing' against a man who exhibited a weapon and said it was the sort of one which did the outrages is a statement which makes me feel rather hopeless about the use of getting evidence. I wonder what would be something if that is nothing'.

Although he helped secure a pardon for Edalji, Conan Doyle failed in his bid to get financial compensation paid, which he said was 'to the deep disgrace of British Administration'.

The correspondence between Conan Doyle and Capt Anson continued until 1911, becoming more and more hostile as the years went by.

In the final exchange, Conan Doyle wrote 'your letter is a series of inaccuracies mixed up with a good deal of rudeness'.

Notes written by Anson at the same time asked 'Is C.D. mad?' and stated 'this matter is a personal one between Sir A. Conan Doyle and myself'.

In a police memo on the case Anson wrote: 'It was on 'evidence' and 'proof' such as he obtained in the above instance that the great Sherlock Holmes based his accusations...'.

In a curious appendix to his printed report published in 1920 marked Confidential, Anson admits to fabricating evidence for Conan Doyle to chase, designed to discredit him and his methods.

It reveals he created an elaborate ruse involving Royden Sharp appearing to travel to London to deliver a poison-pen letter to Conan Doyle.

Experts think the archive of 30 handwritten letters, none of which has ever been published, once belonged to Anson and was passed on following his death in 1947.

Also included in the archive are notes kept by Anson during the case, police reports from the investigation, witness statements, press cuttings and even a police mugshot of Edalji.

The collection will be sold on behalf of a private collector by London auctioneers Bonhams.

The sale coincides with the start of a three-part series Arthur and George, starring Martin Clunes, based on Julian Barnes' 2005 book of the same name following the story of Conan Doyle and Anson.

Sarah Lindberg, head of manuscripts at Bonhams, said: 'This is the first time these letters have ever been seen before and they give a fascinating insight into the lengths Conan Doyle went to to prove Edalji's innocence.

'He saw himself as the champion of justice and after meeting Edalji he set about trying to prove his innocence with the same logical and forensic approach Sherlock Holmes was known for.

'Conan Doyle was so incredibly committed to the case and that comes across in his letters, which he wrote daily and in great detail.

'The majority of the letters are to Captain Anson, the Staffordshire police chief, in a bid to get him to change his mind about the guilt of Edalji.

'Conan Doyle actually went to the crime scenes and gathered evidence himself, which Anson took exception to because he saw it as undermining the police's own work.

'The letters offer a view of the fractious relationship between Conan Doyle and Anson which has not been seen to this extent before.

'Both men were convinced they were right and neither would back down. By the end of the correspondence it is clear they had both lost patience with one another.

'To have such a large collection of handwritten, autographed letters in one collection is very rare. It is likely the archive was compiled by Anson and passed on.

'It is now being sold by a private collector who inherited it from a friend who had connections to the Staffordshire area.

'As soon as this collection came in I knew it was something very special.

'We are expecting a lot of interest from collectors of Arthur Conan Doyle memorabilia and fans of Sherlock Holmes - both have a huge international appeal.'

The auction will be held at Bonhams' Knightsbridge saleroom on March 18.
