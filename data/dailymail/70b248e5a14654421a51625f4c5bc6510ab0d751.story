Deryn Blackwell, from Watton, is currently being treated for two forms of cancer

When Deryn Blackwell was diagnosed with leukaemia, his parents thought things couldn't get any worse.

But two years into his cancer battle, doctors discovered the brave boy had developed another deadly form of the disease - and he was the only person in the world to suffer from both conditions.

The 13-year-old's mother Callie, 32, said: 'My son is fighting TWO cancers - leukaemia 
and Langerhans Cell Sarcoma.

'He is truly just one in seven billion all over the world.'

It has been a rollercoaster ride for the family from Watton, Norfolk. The youngster was first diagnosed with leukaemia in July 2010 after his glands swelled and he lost his appetite.

Then three months into his treatment, he suffered appendicitis. He was 
given just a 20 per cent chance of recovery from the operation because he had
so few white blood cells and his platelets were so low.

Thankfully, surgery was a success and by May 2011 he was in remission. He returned to school that September and his parents started to hope that they were out of the woods.

By August 2012, Deryn faced just one more year of treatment, when he started complaining about pain in his tonsils.

He was seen by a specialist who decided to remove them straight away.

'The ENT surgeon told me that Deryn’s tonsils were very large, very hard,
almost rock-like and extremely difficult the remove. He was 
so shocked by the condition of his tonsils that he immediately sent them
away for analysis,' Mrs Blackwell wrote on her blog.

Tests revealed Deryn not only had leukaemia, he had now also developed a type of cancer called Langerhans Cell 
Sarcoma.

The cancer is so rare that there are thought to be just four other sufferers worldwide.

Sarcomas are a deadly group of cancers which strike the connective tissues, including fat, muscle, cartilage and bone.

The world's top oncology consultants have now got together to decide on the best course of treatment for Deryn as they bid to tackle a health case which is unique and unprecedented.

As a result, Deryn will head to Bristol Royal Hospital for Children for a vital life-saving bone marrow transplant.

While preparing for the make-or-break journey, Callie and her husband Simon, 33, praised their son's incredible bravery and inner strength as he faces months away from home.

Deryn will be totally isolated from the outside world for most of the time as he is stripped of his immune system and surgeons blast him with as much radiotherapy as his young body can take.

'We are prepared to stay at least three months in Bristol with Deryn,' said Mrs Blackwell, who also has a younger son, Dylan, eight.

'But that is if it is straightforward and nothing is ever straightforward with Deryn.

'The sarcoma cancer is so rare that they have never even treated it before but they have decided this is the best course of treatment.

'It is called an R3 protocol, which involves 12 days of conditioning, total body radiotherapy and targeted radiotherapy to his throat - which is where they found the tumours originally.'

Deryn is set to have his crucial bone marrow transplant on March 1 and he will then be put in total isolation for between three and seven months.

All being well, the teenager will then be transferred to Addenbrookes Hospital, Cambridge, for at least a further month of intensive treatment and recovery care.

The pupil will then need to have all his childhood jabs again as he confronts his biggest challenge to date.

His father said: 'He doesn't want to go because he has just been in hospital for three months having intensive chemotherapy and only been home for two weeks.

'He will have to go back into that routine again but he is so positive at the same time and wants to get it over with, to get fixed and get back to school.

'Deryn is so bright - he's top of the class in everything he does and he wants to be a doctor.'

Friends and family have rallied around to help pay for travel costs and allow Deryn's parents to take time off work to care for him.

The family's foundation, DoEveRYthiNg, has now raised more than £7,000. Mr and Mrs Blackwell hope to register it as a charity when Deryn is well again to help other children who have cancer relapses.

Mr Blackwell said: 'Deryn is 100 per cent certain that he will come through this very tough time.

'But whatever happens he will have to have blood tests for the rest of his life and there are other risks such as cataracts and infertility.

'But the way Deryn deals with his own mortality is incredible and it helps everyone else deal with it, too.

'He believes that once this year is over he has the rest of his life to do what he wants and we are all totally behind him.'
