Teenage shooter Amber Hill's bid for Commonwealth Games glory came to an end after a dramatic sudden-death shoot-off in the women's skeet.

Having shot a disappointing 65 out of 75 in qualifying,16-year-old Hill faced a three-way shoot-out with England team-mate Sarah Gray and Panagiota Andreou of Cyprus.

Andreou was first to crack but Gray held her nerve for five rounds of double clays while Hill missed with her fifth.

It was a sad end for one of Team England's best medal hopes but the 2013 BBC Young Sports Personality of the year bowed out gracefully.

'I've really enjoyed it and had a really good day,' she told Press Association. 'I started off well but had a few problems with my last round but I've had a great time and it's been a really good experience.

'I can't say I wasn't nervous. In the first round nerves were definitely there. But I've got to turn it into the positives and look to the future. Sarah shot an incredible final and deserved to go through.

'It's fine margins but I've got a lot of stuff to go back and practice with with my coach. We are looking forward to the World Championships later this year.

'This is my first Commonwealths and I've never been to a competition of this scale so I've definitely learned a lot from this and I will use it in competitions in the future.'

Gray, 27, from Ashford in Kent, will hope to move one step closer to a medal in this afternoon's six-woman semi-final.
