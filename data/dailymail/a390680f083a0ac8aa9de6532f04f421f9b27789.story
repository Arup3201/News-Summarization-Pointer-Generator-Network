With their tattoos, leather boots and vests they perhaps don't look much like church-going types.

But hundreds of bikers were among a congregation blessed by Pope Francis at an open air mass in St Peter's Square yesterday.

The Harley-Davidson fanatics stood out like a sore thumb among a crowd of thousands at a mass for Evangelium Vitae day in Vatican City.

As part of a three-day celebration of the 110-year anniversary of the U.S. company that produces the 'hog', riders parked their bikes along the broad avenue that leads up to the Vatican.

Engines were said to be still rumbling when the Mass started.Â 

During the homily, Francis cautioned that 'power and pleasure', among other things, lead to God being 'replaced by fleeting human idols which offer the intoxication of a flash of freedom, but in the end bring new forms of slavery and death.'

On Wednesday, representatives of the motor company, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, met the pope and gave him two Harley-Davidson Inc. motorcycles and a leather jacket.

But not everyone in Rome was quite as enamoured with the bikers as Pope Francis.

A 25-mile Harley-Davidson parade from the port city of Ostia through central Rome on Saturday prompted some residents to complain about the traffic and noise.

Ten bikes were also involved in a serious accident on the capital's ring road.

Consumer association Codacons said it would file a complaint against the event's organisers, and criticised the pope for giving the company free publicity.

'Since it was a marketing event, the pontiff would have done well to avoid giving free advertising to a well known brand, especially considering the damage done to the city and its inhabitants,' Codacons said in a statement.
