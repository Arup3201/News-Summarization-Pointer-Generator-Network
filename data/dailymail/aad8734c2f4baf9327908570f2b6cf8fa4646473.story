Catching sight of Nigel Pearson up in the stands next to assistants on laptops as his Leicester side dismantled Manchester United, you began to wonder why more managers don’t adopt this high-tech, high-vantage approach.

It is a position Pearson came to by circumstance but has adopted to brilliant effect, with the 5-3 comeback victory over Louis van Gaal’s team the latest in a series of matches he has been able to influence from distance.

Pearson was sent to the stands last August, receiving a one-game touchline ban for remonstrating with officials following defeat by Charlton. Leicester beat Wigan 2-0 the following game, with Pearson able to observe tactical shifts from his panoramic view and react. So he decided to stay.

‘I choose to do what I do because it is in the best interest of the team,’ he said recently. ‘There is no gimmick about it.’

He sits alongside assistant manager Steve Walsh, also head of recruitment, with performance analysts Peter Clark and Andy Blake next in line — three Apple MacBooks on the desk in front logging the action, offering replays.

Pearson is in contact with the dugout via Kevin Phillips, who became first-team coach after retiring this summer, and the former England striker relays messages to Pearson’s other assistant manager Craig Shakespeare.

He was the man at the edge of the technical area on Sunday. There is no direct link because it suits to have Shakepeare assessing the match from ground level without the Leicester manager constantly in his ear.

Pearson heads down for the half time team-talk and is always pitchside at full time to shake the opposing manager’s hand.

Much of the tactical work is done in the days leading up to the match, of course, and Leicester’s team are said to be one of the best in the business. Rob MacKenzie, head of technical scouting, ensures each player is sent a personalised video briefing on their direct opponent’s strengths and weaknesses, even on their days off.

You can be sure Richie de Laet and Paul Konchesky knew about United full backs Rafael and Marcos Rojo’s preference for bombing forward, leaving space behind to exploit.

Former England manager Steve McClaren prefers the vantage point up in the stands

Clive Woodward, who won  the 2003 Rugby World Cup managing England, advocates watching from higher up

‘Generally I think it works pretty well,’ Pearson explained. ‘I can see things in a different way in the stand. Touchline-wise your perspective is limited.

‘I trust my staff implicitly. It is about preparing the team for the game and then helping players manage situations as they arise.’

Other managers have done it, notably Graham Taylor at Watford — where he would then watch the second half in the dugout — and Sam Allardyce at Bolton. He said he would sit in the stands at West Ham once the team was playing the way he wanted, but never has.

Steve McClaren does it at Derby, only heading to the touchline in the latter stages of games, but Pearson is a Premier League maverick in this sense. In rugby coaches often watch from on high. 

Sir Clive Woodward was able to assess the 2003 World Cup final from the stands and make changes accordingly. He believes more football managers should try it. ‘If you’re on the touchline screaming at people, it can be a distraction,’ he says. ‘I used to have messages passed to me from people on all corners of the stadium so I as the head coach could make a proper decision.

Sam Allardyce is another gaffer who has spent time in the stands, but he now prefers the being in the dugout

‘You are far better higher up, in terms of being able to see the game but also being away from the action you have a clearer head. It is good to see Pearson having the foresight and bottle for going against what most people do.’

Woodward also suggests that when he would travel to the Twickenham touchline it carried greater impact for the players. ‘If a team sees you on the touchline then something big is going on.’

Pearson seems to agree and is reluctant to engage in the fashion for English managers to display their involvement to fans.

‘It becomes a theatre at times which I am not interested in,’ he says. ‘But I also feel at times managers should be visible. I’m not saying there is a right way or a wrong way, it just works for us.’
