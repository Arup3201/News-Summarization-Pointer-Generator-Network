Looming out of the sky, its wings outstretched in the glare of the sun's rays, it looked like there was an angel watching over Russia.

But as quickly as it appeared, the angel began to fade away. It wasn't a hallucination - it was the latest stunt from flying daredevils the Russian Knights.

The haunting angel was the finale of a dazzling display to mark the team's 22nd birthday over airfields in Kubinka, on the outskirts of Moscow.

Four Sukhoi SU-27 fighter jets flew vertically in a tight formation, before setting off flares to make the angel take flight.

With daring flips and manoeuvres, two planes separated from the pack to spread the smoke and create the angel's wings.

The Knights - Russikiye Vityazi - are 
the Russian Air Force's equivalent of the British Red Arrows - stunt flyers gleaned from the best serving fighter pilots.

Spreading its wings in the glare of the sun, it looked like an angel was looking down over Russian spectators. But this was the work of daredevil pilots the Russian Knights

The four pilots were flying vertically in formation when they set off flares from their planes to create the mystical effects

The angel took flight when two of the planes began to fly away from the others, spreading out the smoke

The wisps of smoke formed were dramatically backlit by the sun's rays as the two planes extended the angel's wings

The Russian Knights are the Russian Air Force aerobatic display team, like the British Red Arrows, and fly Sukhoi SU-27 fighter jets

The jets form shapes in the sky with a combination of manoeuvres and flares, directing the smoke with their flips and turns

The air show celebrated the 22nd anniversary of the founding of the aerobatics team

Crowds gathered at the Kubinka air base for the anniversary display, which also marked 75 years since the centre's founding

The Russian Knights were joined by the Swifts, another Russian Air Force display team, for the show in Kubinka

The top guns of the Russian Air Force strode across the tarmac before taking to the cockpits of the fighter jets

The aerobatic team usually flies four planes at a time, as seen in the dazzling display for the anniversary

The planes, bearing star emblems under their wings, fly within close proximity of each other during the displays

Parachutes helped the planes return to the ground after the angelic aerobatics
