Ignored: Yue Yue was left with horrific brain injuries and never recovered

Grief: Yue Yue's mother and father were left devastated by their daughter's death

Two-year-old Wang Yue was struck by the vehicles on a busy market street on October 13, and the gruesome ordeal was captured by security camera footage.

The horrific video showed the bleeding child ignored by 18 passersby before she was picked up by a scrap picker and given to her mother, who rushed to the street looking for her.

A week after the accident, the child was dead.

Police said they were able to identify the vehicles from the footage.

The video of the incident quickly 
spread via the internet causing shock around the world and triggered a 
bout of bitter soul searching in China about the nationâ€™s apparent moral
 decay in the midst of an economic boom.

As
 a result people in China called upon the government to introduce a 
'Good Samaritan law' to punish passersby who refuse to help people in 
need.

The case triggered
 a furor across the nation, which questioned how such callousness could 
occur - with some blaming it a descent into an 'immoral modern society'.

China's economic boom and the growing 
disparity between the rich and poor have made changing social values a 
contentious topic, with some lamenting what they see as materialism 
replacing morals.

Yue Yue's death quickly became the most talked about topic on China's version of Twitter, Sina's Weibo.

Gongzai Xiaoben posted: 'I hope that 
this little angel who was discarded by society can act as a wake-up call
 to the nation about the importance of moral education.'

Winter space added: 'Hope you can find some love in heaven. This world is full of apathy.'

Her father had received more than 
270,000 yuan ($42,280) to help pay for Wang's medical treatment after 
receiving donations from across the globe.

One local Communist party chief urged 'searching reflection' over the incident, according to the official Guangzhou Daily.

'Take active and effective steps to raise the moral standards of the entire society,' he told a meeting of province officials.

Wang
 Yang, a top official, told a high-level provincial meeting that the 
tragedy of Yue Yue should be a 'wake-up call' for society and that such incidents 
should not be allowed to occur again.

'We should look into the ugliness in ourselves with a dagger of conscience and bite the soul-searching bullet.'

Many people in China are hesitant to 
help people who appear to be in distress for fear that they will be 
blamed.

High-profile lawsuits have ended with Good Samaritans ordered to
 pay hefty fines to individuals they sought to help.

In
 Guangdong, where Yue Yue lived her brief life, the local party branch 
and government are attempting to apply a sticky plaster over Chinese 
society's gaping wound by discussing a new law to make it illegal for 
people to ignore strangers in distress.

Lawyer
 Zhu Yongping says that the province could establish a Good Samaritan 
law as a local law, but it is difficult to define the motives of a 
person in each individual case.

A group of lawyers will discuss the idea
 next month and push for related legislation.

Despite
 its current social conditions, the Chinese government can point to some
 positive achievements, having lifted 400 million out of poverty to 
create a new middle class living in modern high rises in futuristic 
cities and peasants finding new lives in the factory boom towns.

The vast majority of Chinese are literate and many well educated. Many are poor but none are starving.
