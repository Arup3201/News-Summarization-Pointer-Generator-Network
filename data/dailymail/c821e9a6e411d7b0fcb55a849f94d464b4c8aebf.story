Pakistani schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai told her friend not to worry because the Taliban 'have never come for a small girl', shortly before she was shot in the head by a militant.

The 16-year-old was gunned down last year on her school bus after angering the Taliban with her brave and outspoken pleas for girls to be educated.

In her autobiography, I am Malala, she describes the moment she was shot on her way home from school in the valley of Swat in north-west Pakistan on October 9, 2012.

Malala Yousafzai revealed in her autobiography that she told her friend not to worry because the Taliban 'have never come after a small girl' shortly before she was shot in the head by a militant

Malala was travelling with about 20 other girls when a masked man approached their school bus and said: 'Who is Malala?'

Although no one said a word, some girls looked at Malala and she as the only one with her face uncovered.

In excerpts from her autobiography, published in Parade magazine, she wrote: 'That's when he lifted up a black pistol.

The schoolgirl wrote about the moment she was shot in her autobiography, I Am Malala

'Some of the girls screamed. [Best friend] Moniba tells me I squeezed her hand.

'My friends say he fired three shots. The first went through my left eye socket and out under my left shoulder.

'I slumped forward onto Moniba, blood coming from my left ear, so the other two bullets hit the girls next to me... My friends later told me the gunman's hand was shaking as he fired.'

The bullet miraculously missed her brain.

She travelled to Britain for treatment but her injuries were so bad that her father asked relatives to start arranging her funeral.

After spending three months recovering in hospital, she and her family now live in Birmingham.

She attracted the wrath of the Taliban after writing a blog for the BBC when she was 11 and also appeared in a New York Times documentary.

Malala has since become an education and peace advocate and recently wowed dignitaries at the United Nations in New York with a speech on education on her sixteenth birthday.

She has also been invited to Buckingham Palace and it is thought the Queen is impressed by Malala's bravery.

A Palace spokesman said: 'We 
understand that Malala Yousafzai will be attending the Commonwealth 
Universities and Education Reception at Buckingham Palace.'

A doctor who helped save Malala after she transferred to Birmingham for treatment has spoken of the pressure she felt to save her.

Fiona Reynolds, an intensive care specialist at Birmingham Children's Hospital, told the Sunday Times: 'I'd become a doctor because I was lucky to get a good education.

'I felt if she'd died I would have killed Pakistan's Mother Teresa.

'Not often in my pampered life am I asked to put my neck out.'

She said there is now a child alive 'who could make a lot of difference to the world'.

She
has been invited to a reception for Youth, Education and the 
Commonwealth, being hosted by the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh on 
October 18.

Guests are 
expected to include academics and teachers. It is being arranged as a 
celebration of young people across the Commonwealth in education.

In New York, Malala called on governments to act in the fight for education and to eradicate poverty and terrorism.

She said girls are being pushed into 'the Stone Age'.

She said: 'Women are not even accepted as human beings. They are treated with injustice and inequality. Women are denied.

'They are neglected, even in the developed countries where they are not given the opportunities to do what they want. Even in America, people are waiting for a woman president.

'I know that issues are countless and enormous but the solution is one and simple and that is education, education, education.

'We can fight all these hardships and lead to quality education for both boys and girls.'

She told dignitaries, including Hilary Clinton, that to end wars in Syria, Pakistan and Afghanistan 'instead of sending guns, send books. Instead of sending tanks, send pens. Instead of sending soldiers, send teachers.'

She has set up the Malala Fund, which promotes education for girls and women across the world.
