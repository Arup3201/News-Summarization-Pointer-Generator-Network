In the end, City remembered their duty to play like champions. Two goals conjured from the dying embers of a testing match restored their confidence and increased their optimism that their title can be retained. The Premier League may not be won at this autumnal stage of the season, but a defeat would have proved crushingly expensive. As it turned out, the fans were singing, blue flags were waving and the table was looking a happier place.

The goals came from the kind of players who were acquired — at enormous expense — with precisely these occasions in mind. Yaya Toure, after emerging slowly into the match, remained icily cool amid the uproar as he simply passed his chance into the net. And Sergio Aguero, totally unruffled by his earlier misses, did what he does supremely well — surging on to the chance, controlling the ball at pace and tearing off a scoring drive. At such moments, their talents seem to have been purchased all too cheaply.

In truth, City were not entirely convincing. There was an incoherence about their approach play, their finishing lacked its usual authority and while they were rarely put under genuinely testing pressure, their defence allowed the kind of space which better teams than Villa might have exploited. But they retained a conviction that everything would work out, that this story would have a happy ending. And so it proved.

Villa Park is the kind of place where prospective champions must come to state their case. They have to look impressive, at ease with their talents, perhaps the touch of an intimidating swagger. City understood the demands; meeting them was proving a problem. They offered energy to spare, commitment to burn, but little of that crisp, incisive passing which distinguishes their better days.

As ever, the major players were as good as their reputations. Vincent Kompany was massively influential in central defence, perceiving problems seconds before anybody had even suspected them and dealing with them with his customary authority. David Silva ghosted through the game with intelligent awareness; controlling the tempo of the effort, subtly investigating defensive lapses. And at the point of the attack, Aguero simply oozed menace and intent, reminding us why he is possibly the finest striker in all England.

But given such resources, City were making hard work of their task. At times in the first half, they looked not so much a good team as an extremely expensive one.

Despite early frustration, Manchester City proved their title credentials with a win at Villa Park

And the home side, in truth, had been no more than awkward. A combination of finance and circumstance has made Villa one of those clubs who seem to know their place. And that place is not to be found alongside the likes of Manchester City. They work with energy, they toil unsparingly to put their plans into action, yet they remain a team who seem grateful for small mercies.

And yet, there is a genuine spirit about their game, and they revealed it within moments of the second half. First, they allowed Aguero the kind of chance which the finest striker in all England usually buries. This time, Aguero thumped it wastefully against a post. At which relief, Villa scampered purposefully into City’s defensive quarters and Kieran Richardson was frustrated only in the final step of an enterprising attack. A Villa goal at that stage would have provoked a real examination of City’s credentials.

As the match entered its final third, as the game became stretched and as Villa legs began to betray the strain of endless chasing, we waited for the major players to strike the telling blows. But as minutes ticked past, so the nerves grew taut. Aguero struck a fine blow, well parried By Brad Guzan. Silva’s finish met a similar fate, while the sweeper Eliaquim Mangala was allowed the finest chance of all, but fluffed his header.

Suddenly emboldened, the Villa fans started to mock their aristocratic visitors. They even began to believe that their own folk hero, the substitute Christian Benteke, might upset form and overwhelming fancy. And then, with eight minutes remaining, Yaya Toure scored the goal which shattered their illusions. It was a touch of glittering class. When Aguero made his contribution, the argument was over. They may have cause to remember those moments when the points are counted in May.
