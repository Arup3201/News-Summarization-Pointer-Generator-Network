Plans have been unveiled for more than 200 road building schemes that could rip through the heart of the British countryside.

One of the routes includes a motorway tearing through the Peak District to link Manchester to Barnsley, despite a similar proposal being dumped in the 1990s because of strong opposition.

Another unpopular plan has already been given approval for a road that would cut through Combe Haven nature reserve in East Sussex, linking Hastings and Bexhill.

Abby Nicol, from the Combe Haven Defenders, said it will train others looking to block road building elsewhere, and added: 'The government is sponsoring a new wave
of road building across the country.

'This amazing area, and others, will be destroyed unless we take action.'

The Campaign for Better Transport told The Sunday Times it has uncovered plans for 190 road schemes, with most due to be published this autumn.

It said they come from local authorities and Local Enterprise Partnerships - unelected, 
business-led groups set up with Government approval to drive regional economic growth, including through transport infrastructure.

Other schemes include widening the A303 from Hampshire to Devon, past Stonehenge. It is being led by a group of councils and is similar to plans abandoned by Government in the 1990s.

The revelation comes 20 years after plans for a road through Twyford Down, an area of ancient chalk downland in Hampshire, was met by passionate protests.

It was one of hundreds of projects proposed as part a £12bn Government road building programme.

Subsequent protests, such as those led by Swampy at the Newbury Bypass in Berkshire, ended with the Government slashing its plans to around 150 roads, but the project was scrapped completely by Labour in 1997.

Local authorities have since been given greater control over roads and the Department for Transport said £7bn is lost every year because of traffic jams.

It added: 'This is not only a brake on growth and prosperity but is environmentally damaging.'

The anti-roads protestors are being boosted ahead of their pending battles by a £2.5m pledge from founder of Lush cosmetics, Mark Constantine, who highlighted the 'big budgets' that Government and road builders.
