It's the question fans have been asking since current Doctor Who Matt Smith announced he was quitting the Tardis: Is it time for a woman to take on the famous role?

Certainly not, according to former Doctor Peter Davison, who insists the character should always be a man.

Davison, who appeared in the BBC sci-fi drama between 1981 and 1984, said: ‘I’ll probably get into trouble for saying this but I think it sort of has to be a man.

‘To have a female would be like having a female James Bond. It would be a rather odd thing.’

Despite his comments, a number of actresses, including Broadchurch star Olivia Colman, are being linked with the iconic role. 

Since first appearing on our television screens in 1963, Doctor Who has been played by 11 men but never a woman.

Davison, whose actress daughter Georgia played a female Time Lord on the programme in 2008, added: ‘If you suddenly make the Doctor a woman, you effectively say, “Well, let’s give him a sex change” and I don’t think that works.

‘I’m very happy for there to be a female Time Lord. I think my daughter is one and she is shooting around the universe now.’

Some fans believed that Georgia, 28, 
who is married to former Doctor David Tennant, could have been made a 
future Doctor but her character has not been seen since.

Davison’s
 comments come as the show prepares to celebrate its 50th anniversary 
with a special edition starring both Smith, who announced in June that 
he was quitting the role after Christmas, and Tennant.

The actor, 62, also claimed that powerful BBC figures were opposed to bringing the show back in 2005 after an absence of 17 years.

His remarks will be seen as a swipe against Michael Grade, who was BBC1 controller when Doctor Who was taken off air in 1988 and who was back as BBC chairman when it returned.

Davison said: ‘It went off the air, not because the viewing figures dropped off, but because the powers that be at the time didn’t want it on air. They wanted to get rid of it, they didn’t like it.

‘I think nothing annoyed them more than when it came back as the most prestigious BBC programme  at that time – it still is, in fact.  Especially as one particular person was there when it came back.’

Surprise: Baker's trademark scarf became an unlikely hit on the show

Former Doctor Who Tom Baker has revealed how his trademark scarf became an unlikely hit on the show.

Baker, the longest-serving Doctor, having played him from 1974 to 1981, said: ‘The producers looked at some kind of French artist and they decided that I should look like that.

‘We bought the wool and gave it to a woman called Begonia Pope and said, “Knit me a scarf with this sequence of colours.”

‘A few weeks later we went to her house and we couldn’t get in because of this bloody scarf. It was all over the place.

'I laughed, but the designer said, “Let’s keep it like that,” so we did.’
