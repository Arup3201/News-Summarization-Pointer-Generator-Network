Trial: Mark Bridger, the man accused of the murder of April Jones, arrives at Mold Crown Court as the jury retired to consider its verdicts today

A jury has retired to begin its deliberations in the trial of the man accused of murdering April Jones.

Mark Bridger, 47, is accused at Mold Crown Court of snatching and murdering the five-year-old in a 'sexually motivated' attack.

Bridger, a former slaughterhouse worker from Ceinws, denies abduction, murder and intending to pervert the course of justice.

He claims he killed April when he accidentally 'crushed' her with his Land Rover but cannot remember what he did with the body because he was drunk and panicking.

Today the jury of nine women and three men was asked to begin its deliberations after a month long trial and were told to take 'all the time they need', the judge told them.

In her closing speech to the jury yesterday, Elwen Evans QC, prosecuting, said: 'The evidence overwhelmingly compels the conclusion that the defendant is guilty of each count in this case.'

Beginning his address, Brendan Kelly QC, defending, urged the jury to put aside the 'obvious emotions' attached to the case and decide their verdict on the evidence.

Claims: Mark Bridger, 47, claims that he hit April Jones, 5, with his car and cannot remember what happened to her body

He said: 'Mark Bridger denies these offences, he denies the inferences which you have been invited to draw, he challenges the 'compelling' evidence which the Crown advances, he says he is not guilty of these offences.'

Beginning his summing up, trial judge Mr Justice Griffith Williams gave the jury legal directions and urged them to conduct a 'dispassionate review of the evidence.'

April disappeared as she was playing with a friend near their homes on the Bryn-y-Gog estate, Machynlleth, Powys, on October 1 last year.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
