Everyone has their own ideas on how they would splash their new cash if they were lucky enough to win the lottery.

But National Lottery operator Camelot have taken out a survey which shows that lottery winners have a surprising number of purchases in common.

Around half of winners move within three months of a big win and a poll of new millionaires found almost a third (29 per cent) bought a hot tub and a similar number (28 per cent) had a walk-in wardrobe.

Nearly a quarter (24 per cent) had electric gates at their new home, one in five (22 per cent) set up a games room and 17 per cent bought a snooker table.

A fifth (22 per cent) bought a dog while one in 25 (4 per cent) got a cat.

How would you spend yours? Camelot have revealed how winners spend their millions

Some 16% adopted a healthy lifestyle with a gym in their home and one in 10 (12 per cent) installed a bar to have drinks to celebrate their good fortune.

One millionaire admitted having three pianos in their house and another said they bought a wishing well.

Just under one in 10 (9 per cent) said their new house had a river or lake in the grounds.

Surprisingly, less than a third (30 per cent) said they employed a cleaner to keep their new home spick and span.

A special EuroMillions Millionaire Raffle draw will guarantee 18 new millionaires in the UK tomorrow.

A National Lottery spokesman said: 'With 18 new millionaires guaranteed to be made this Friday, everyone will be discussing their dream house.

'It seems that when planning your spending, any millionaire needs to factor in the essentials - a giant wardrobe, a hot tub, a cleaner and of course a dog.

'This draw will be a special night for 18 lucky ticket-holders, who will all become a millionaire overnight.'

Bucking the trend: Matt Topham and Cassey Carrington bought a reasonably priced tent

Of course someone always bucks the trend and recent Nottingham jackpot lottery millionaires Matt Topham and Cassey Carrington invested in a £39.99 tent so they could camp in style at V Festival.

But like other winners in the past the couple, both 22, did buy their own dream house - a modest £249,000 house on a cul-de-sac.

The sale came as a surprise to new neighbours who revealed that the house had been on the market since 2009 because nobody wanted to buy it.

Tomorrow’s estimated EuroMillions jackpot is £51 million.
