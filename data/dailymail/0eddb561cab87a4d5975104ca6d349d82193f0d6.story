The blood-stained shirt that the governor of Texas was wearing while riding inside the car with President Kennedy on the day he was shot has now been put on display.

Governor John Connally was seated in front of the President in the open-top convertible when the shooting occurred, and he was hit in the chest.

Now the bloody shirt and suit that Connally wore on that day when he nearly died have been put on display as part of an exhibit being organized in coordination with the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's assassination.

Part of history: The suit and shirt that Governor John Connally wore on the day of the Kennedy assassination have been put on display as part of the 50th anniversary commemorations

Bullet hole: Connally was shot in the chest but managed to be saved, unlike President Kennedy

Close: Connally was seated directly in front of President Kennedy in the fatal car ride on November 22, 1963

It will be the first public display since 1964 for the clothing Connally wore November 22, 1963, during Kennedy's visit.

The white Arrow brand shirt, size 16 with a 35-inch sleeve, has faded over the years and the now brown blood stains and spatters cover nearly all of it.

There are bullet holes in the shirt's chest, back shoulder and right cuff and three buttons are missing, presumably due to emergency medical responders ripping the garment away to reach Connelly's chest wound.

The damage to the three-button suit, from Oxford Clothiers in Fort Worth, is less pronounced.

His wife Nellie Connally had it cleaned before it was presented to the state archives, Anderson said, so there's no evidence of blood but the coat has bullet holes that match those on the shirt, plus a hole on the left leg just above and toward the inside of the knee.

Jarring: This is the first time that the shirt and suit will be publicly displayed, seen here in the Archives in Austin

Shot in the chest: The bullet could have killed Connally but he was saved at the hospital

Emergency room staff at Dallas' Parkland Memorial Hospital removed the clothing from Connally after the shooting since he was seriously wounded.

John Anderson, preservation officer at the archives, said the display tells an important aspect of a well-known story.

'For Texans, this is something that maybe gets forgotten by some of the rest of the world, that Governor Connally was shot at the same time,' he said, noting that Connally's chest wound could have been fatal.

Part of history: Conservator Sarah Norris is seen next to the shirt that was donated by Connally's wife

'The first thing that jumps out at you is the damage,' said Norris, who has been assembling the exhibit for several months.

'The most dramatic is the shirt.'

The shirt and suit are jarring, but they are not necessarily the best-known pieces of clothing from the fatal day.

The pink blood-stained suit that First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy was wearing at the time of the shooting, but that will not be part of the exhibit since it is held at the National Archives in Maryland. It has never been displayed.
