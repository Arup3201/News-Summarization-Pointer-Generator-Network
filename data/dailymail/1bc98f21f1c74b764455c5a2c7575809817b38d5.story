Scientists still have only seen glimpses of the 'cosmic dawn', when stars were forming in the calm, dark cosmos.

An international team lead by Masami Ouchi of the University of Tokyo has found the most vigorous star-forming galaxy yet seen from the period - a huge mass of gas forming stars at a rate of around a hundred suns per year.

It's one of the most distant galaxies ever seen by mankind - and it's also unique. Although nine galaxies have been detected from the period just after Big Bang, the 750-million-year-old GN-108036 was forming stars far faster than the others, when most of the universe was still cold and dark. 

A researcher at the University of Tokyo has found the most vigorous star-forming galaxy yet seen from the cold, dark period just after the Big Bang - a large mass of gas forming stars at a rate of around a hundred suns per year

The team obtained calculated the galaxy's distance from Earth to confirm that it is one of the most distant galaxies ever discovered.

Analysis of Hubble images showed intense brightness that made it clear stars were forming rapidly.

The astronomers found a large mass of gas, equivalent to about a hundred Suns per year, was forming stars.

Team leader Ouchi said, 'The significant finding about GN-108036 is that it demonstrates the existence of a vigorous star-forming galaxy when the universe was still very cold and dark.'

The star was discovered by the Subaru Prime Focus Camera in Hawaii - then astronomers observed it with a spectrograph from the Keck Observatory, also on Hawaii, to confirm its distance from earth.

Astronomers have so far detected nine galaxies from the period 600 to 800 million years after the Big Bang - the 'cosmic dawn' - but GN-108036 the most active star-forming region detected to date

Yoshiaki Ono at the University of Tokyo, a team member and the leading author of the article, said, 'We went back and repeated our observations on three different occasions over two years. We observed the feature at the same wavelength on each occasion. It is undisputed evidence for the huge distance to the galaxy.'

The astronomers searched for a sign of detection by using recent observations of the GOODS field with the Hubble Space Telescope's newly-installed camera, WFC3.

They confirmed detection of GN-108036 in the WFC3 image; the galaxy's intense brightness in the intrinsic ultraviolet indicated that it contained many young, massive stars.

'The amount of stars born every year was more than ten times higher than those in the other galaxies at a comparable distance,'explained Ono. 'We're surprised to know that such a vigorous galaxy existed at a time when the universe was only five percent of its present age.'
