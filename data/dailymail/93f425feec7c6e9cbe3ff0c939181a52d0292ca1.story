Nancy Pfister, 57, died from a blunt force injury to the head at her home in Aspen, a coroner said on Wednesday

A socialite who was found dead in her home in Aspen was killed by a blunt force injury to her head, the Pitkin County coroner said on Wednesday.

Nancy Pfister, 57, was hit with a hard object that had a small, curved shape.

She had been dead about 36 hours before her body was found on February 26, coroner J. Steven Ayers said.

Prosecutors have filed first-degree murder charges against three people, including a couple who had rented Pfister's home while she was in Australia.

William Styler III, 65, and his wife, Nancy Styler, 62, were arrested on March 3 after moving out of the home on about February 22.

Katherine Carpenter, 56, an assistant to Pfister and a bank employee, was arrested on March 14.

Authorities said she called 911 to report she found Pfister's body in a closet of the home.

Investigators have been tight-lipped about the case, and key court documents have been sealed.

Ayers said his office wasn't covered by the court order sealing the files. His report contains some of the only details about the case to be made public.

Prosecutors have filed a motion to unseal other documents, saying no more arrests are expected so there is no longer a reason to keep the files closed.

Some media organizations have also asked the court to release the documents.

Defense attorneys have told the judge they oppose the release.

Pfister
 was the daughter of the late Betty and Art Pfister, longtime prominent 
Aspen residents who co-founded the Buttermilk ski area west of town. 
Buttermilk Mountain has hosted the Winter X Games multiple times.

Pfister's death was the first homicide case in Pitkin County in 12 years, not counting those classified as murder-suicides.

The Stylers and Carpenter are being held without bond. They are scheduled to return to court April 23.

Pfister wrote on Facebook on February 3 
that 'the people that were supposedly taking care of my house are not 
doing what they said they would do and they're not paying rent and they 
haven't paid utilities'.

Over the years Pfister had paid 
Carpenter, an employee at two Apline bank branches in Aspen, to manage 
her property and to walk her dog, Gabe, who came with the $4,000-a-month
 lease.

On February 6, 
Pfister posted on Facebook that she was looking for new tenants and that
 anyone interested should contact Carpenter.

She subsequently returned from Australia and, days later, was found dead by Carpenter.

Juliana Pfister attended those 
proceedings surrounded by friends, telling ABC News that she couldn't 
believe someone would kill her fun-loving mother because of an alleged 
rent dispute.

'How could someone just be so angry that they got kicked out of a house?' she said.

'There's got to be something more. It's hard to understand that.'

Investigators spent weeks at Pfister's house, which remained an active crime, removing many boxes and files as evidence.

County Sheriff Joe DiSalvo has released few details about the resort town's first murder investigation since 2001.

'This is a very important case,' he said. 'It just doesn't happen in Aspen.'
