A New Orleans homicide detective and visual artist has been placed on desk duty following accusations that he wrote a message in the coagulated blood of a murder victim at a crime scene.

The New Orleans Police Department confirmed that Charles Hoffacker, 32, is the subject of a complaint that he wrote in the blood of a murder victim last week.

He has been decommissioned and cannot wear his uniform or carry a gun while an investigation is being carried out.

Hoffacker's attorney Eric Hessler told WWLTV that Hoffacker's actions have been exaggerated and that the body and all physical evidence had long been removed from the scene when the alleged blood-scrawling took place. 

Furthermore, he says, Hoffacker didn't violate any departmental rules.

Hoffacker is a respected New Orleans artist who channels his experience as a homicide detective into his works.

From 3pm until midnight, he investigates gritty killings across the city, but each morning he can be found painting at home.

His works range from tongue-in-cheek portraits of political figures including Dick Cheney and Anthony Weiner to a mosaic of notorious local gangster Telly Hankton created using thousands of bullet casings.

'I don’t think I would be as passionate about my art as I am, if I was not a policeman,' Hoffacker told Ozy. 'I wouldn’t have the ideas, I wouldn’t have the passion, I wouldn’t have the pain.

'I go see young black men torn apart by gun violence every day in New Orleans. I offset that by coming home, clearing my head and painting.'

New Orleans has one of the highest murder rates in the country. Although it's fallen dramatically in recent years, it's stull eight times higher than the national average.

Hessler says stress may have been a factor in Hoffacker's actions.

'This was an isolated incident that happened during a very, very difficult time for New Orleans and for this officer also,' Hessler told WWLTV. 'And I’m hoping that the NOPD sees it that way and treats it that way.'

He says Hoffacker had worked two double shifts over the Memorial Day weekend that saw four people killed and another 15 wounded, a very high toll even for New Orleans.

The owner of Barrister's Gallery, which has regularly shown Hoffacker's works for almost a decade says that the artist-cum-detective feels deeply the violence and turmoil to which he is exposed on a daily basis.

'On at least two occasions, he described crime scenes to me with such pathos, such personal anguish, that I remember distinctly on one of those times tears coming out of his eyes,' Andy Antippas told WWLTV.'If there were 50 more like him, our police force would be a lot stronger. Whatever it is he’s been accused of, someone has misconstrued something.'

On one occasion, Hoffacker donated a charcoal portrait of a murder victim to the victim's family so they could auction it off to raise a reward to find the suspect.

The New Orleans Police Department's Public Integrity Bureau now has 14 days to determine whether to classify the investigation as criminal or administrative.
