ABC has 
announced that Diane Sawyer will step down from the 'World News'
 anchor chair and David Muir will take over the flagship newscast.

Sawyer's
 departure comes only five years after she assumed the role and allows 
Muir, 40, to ascend to the broadcast after more than a decade with the network.

The 68-year-old icon is set to leave the newscast at the end of August with Muir to begin his run at 'World News' September 2.

Discussions surrounding Sawyer's departure started in earnest earlier this year, ABC News president James Goldston wrote in a press release.

'After wonderful years at 'World News' I decided it is time to move to a new full time role at ABC News,' Sawyer said.

Sawyer
 will take on the role previously held by the recently-retired Barbara 
Walters. She will host specials, conduct in-depth investigations and  big name interviews.

'For many years to come Diane will be a driving force at ABC News with her exceptional storytelling genius,' said Goldston  'She is one of the giants of modern journalism. Her curiosity, passion and energy are unmatched, and I can’t wait to see where she’ll lead us next.'

Leading man: George Stahanopoulos will continue to host both 'good Morning America' and 'This Week'

Congratulations all around: Sawyer took to Twitter to share her happiness for both Muir and Stephanopoulos

The surprise announcement came as 'World News' began to gain ground on NBC's ratings-leading 'Nightly News,' according to the latest Nielsen ratings.

'World News' won the May sweeps for the first time in six years and is riding a five-year ratings high, the network noted.

Muir has hosted the weekend edition of 'World News' and been the substitute anchor for Sawyer during the week for some time, his appointment is not a surprise to most.

He also has hosted the popular ABC news magazine '20/20' and reported on many of the past decade's biggest stories.

His promotion returns prime time network news to an all-male field with Scott Pelley at CBS and Brian Williams at NBC.

Also announced Wednesday is that 'Good Morning America' and 'This Week' host George Stephanopoulos will be promoted to chief anchor at the network and handle national breaking news, elections and other special coverage.

'George will be our lead anchor for major special events and breaking news at ABC, driving our live network coverage for the biggest stories,' said Goldston.

Muir's rise to the top of the network's newscast began when he joined in 2003 to host 'World News Now,' an overnight news program carried around the country by many affiliates.

He soon found himself covering the 'Arab Spring' uprisings and other major news events around the world, as well as beginning to fill in as host of 'World News' and other news programs.

The newly-minted face of ABC worked at multiple local affiliates prior to joining the network, including in Boston and his hometown of Syracuse, New York.

Muir is not married and has no children.

ABC has not announced who will take over the weekend newscast.
