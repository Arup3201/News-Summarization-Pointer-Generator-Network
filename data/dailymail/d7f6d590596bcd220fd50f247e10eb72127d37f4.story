Unsettling video footage has given the first look into the massive sinkhole that opened up beneath a Florida home and swallowed a man from his bed in February.

Jeff Bush, 37, was sucked into the sinkhole while he slept in his family home in Seffner and when his brother, Jeremy, jumped in the hole to try to save him, he was nowhere to be seen.

Footage taken by a contractor who examined the hole shortly before the home was demolished has now been released by the county, and shows that every piece of furniture has vanished.

Most bizarre is how the ground has completely given way - revealing the brown dirt beneath - yet hats, high-visibility jackets and shelves remain on the wall above where Bush's bed once was.

A day after the accident, authorities stopped their search for Bush as tests showed no sign of life in the hole. The house has now been torn down and the family hopes to set up a memorial at the site.

Neighbours left their properties and the county has said that the houses on each side of the sinkhole house will have to be condemned, Fox News reported.

'The results of the geophysical tests concluded that the subsurface soils were unstable as subsidence activity is evidenced at each site,' County Administrator Michael Merrill said.

He added that residents should speak with engineers before they try to collect their belongings.

Bush, 37, was in his bedroom in Seffner - a suburb of 8,000 people 15 miles east of downtown 
Tampa - when the earth opened up on the night of February 28.

Five others in the house escaped unharmed.

Jeremy 
Bush, 36, recalled how he desperately tried to pull his brother, Jeff, from the rubble
 as he heard his screams for help.

'I ran in there and heard somebody screaming, my brother screaming, and I ran in there,' he told My Fox Tampa Bay .

'And
 all I see is this big hole. All I see is the top of his bed. I didn't 
see anything else, so I jumped in the hole and tried getting him out.

Hidden: The hole was largely hidden beneath the home but was seen as the property was demolished

'The
 floor was still giving in and the dirt was still going down, but I 
didn't care. I wanted to save my brother. I could hear him screaming for
 me, hollering for
 me. I couldn't do nothing.'

Jeremy had tried to save his brother 
when he heard him screaming, but was unable to reach him. A deputy 
pulled Jeremy out of the sinkhole, and likely saved his life.

Following the tragedy, Jeremy Bush said he believed the rescue teams should not have given up so soon.

'I feel like they could 
have tried harder to get my brother out of there,' he said. 'That was my
 brother. No one is even talking about what my mom and dad are going 
through. They don't want to be on camera. My mom and dad are going 
through hell right now.'

The 20-foot-wide opening of the sinkhole was almost covered by the 
house, and rescuers said there were no signs of life after the hole 
opened.

Experts say thousands of sinkholes 
erupt yearly in Florida because of the state's unique geography, though 
most are small and deaths rarely occur.

'There's hardly a place in Florida 
that's immune to sinkholes,' said Sandy Nettles, who owns a geology 
consulting company. 'There's no way of ever predicting where a sinkhole 
is going to occur.'

Watch out: Florida, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania are the states most affected by sinkholes, according to the U.S. Geological Survey

A sinkhole is a hole that opens up suddenly in the ground. They mostly occur because of erosion or underground water that gathers naturally or due to man-made activities.

When this water dissolves the foundation beneath the surface layer, spaces and caverns develop underground. Limestone, carbonate rock, 
and salt beds are particular vulnerable to this erosion.

Meanwhile, the top layer of Earth usually stays intact. When the dissolving area beneath the surface becomes too large, the surface suddenly gives way.

According
 to the U.S. Geological Survey, Florida, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, 
Kentucky, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania are the states most affected by 
sinkholes.

While they often
 occur from natural causes, sinkholes can be man-made and caused by 
human activity. Groundwater pumping and construction are the most likely
 culprits. They can also occur when water drainage systems are changed.
