A mother-of-two who cared more about going to a Bon Jovi concert than looking after her injured toddler was spared jail by a judge today.

The 22-year-old rock fan mother took her daughter to hospital suffering from a broken wrist - but asked when she could get away because she had tickets to see Jon Bon Jovi's band in Cardiff.

Paediatric nurses were shocked when the mum asked how long treatment would take – despite the fact that her toddler had 15 different bruises and a wrist injury that happened 'some time' before.

The 22-year-old mother had tickets to see Jon Bon Jovi at Cardiff City Stadium in June last year. She took her daughter to hospital, but kept asking when she could leave and go to the concert 

The mother denied causing bruising and neglecting to get medical attention for the fracture but was found guilty today following a trial at Cardiff Crown Court.

She was given a 12-month suspended jail term and was ordered to complete 240 hours unpaid work.

Judge Daniel Williams said: 'You were preoccupied with wanting to know how long you would be at the hospital because you wanted to go to the Bon Jovi concert.

'The truth is that at the hospital you cared more for your attendance at that concert than you did for your two-year-old daughter.'

The mother told the trial she was unaware her little girl had fractured her wrist when she fell from the lavatory at home just before going away for a week's holiday last summer.

She gave her daughter Calpol when she became upset and the little girl fell asleep and afterwards seemed well.

The injury was found to be healing by the time she took her to their GP and then to hospital on her return.

But Judge Williams said: 'The pain would have been extreme for a time, would have been suffered by her for some time afterwards and it would have been obvious to you.'

There was also bruising to the side of the child's head and bruises on her thighs which must have been caused using force.

'In all there were 15 bruises and the location makes it clear that you subjected her to serious violence,' said the judge.

'When you came back from your holiday you could not put off seeing your mother and, acting as any caring person would, she told you to go to your GP.'

He warned the woman: 'Failure to comply fully with the suspended sentence could result in you being ordered to serve the 12 months.'

The mum had suggested the bruising on the toddler's legs must have been caused when she got stuck in a plastic swimming ring on their holiday.

Judge Williams said: 'It is left  to speculate what you did to your daughter because you still maintain the lie that injuries were not inflicted by you.'

The mother, who cannot be named, had tickets for the Bon Jovi concert at the Cardiff City Stadium last summer.

Cardiff Crown Court heard her greatest punishment has been losing custody of the little girl and a second child.

They are now being cared for by other relatives.
