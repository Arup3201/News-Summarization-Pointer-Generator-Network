Tottenham have held further discussions with Marseille over a potential deal for midfielder Florian Thauvin. 

The 22-year-old has been left out of the squad for this weekend's game with Metz as Marseille push for a £15m sale. 

The winger, who can also play behind the striker, was the subject of enquiries from Spurs earlier in the year and has also been watched by Chelsea and Valencia.  

Tottenham have held further talks with Ligue 1 side Marseille over a possible deal for Florian Thauvin 

Marseille are already resigned to losing Andre Ayew and Andre-Pierre Gignac with English sides keen on both. 

Everton, Newcastle and Swansea, have all shown an interest in Ayew, who is a free agent in the summer.
