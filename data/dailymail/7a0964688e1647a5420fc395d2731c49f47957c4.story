Australia-based couple Dylan Toh and Marianne Lim combine parenting with their passion for landscape photography - by carrying their two children, Charlotte, three, and eight-month-old Jaime, on their backs as they travel the globe.

The nomadic couple didn't want having children prevent them from fulfilling their dream to explore the world  taking awe-inspiring, breathtaking landscape photographs as they go.

Dylan Toh has even written a guide to managing travel photography while accompanied by small children.

'Dawning' by the couple was taken in Ecola State Park in Oregon, America, as they travelled the world with their kids and equipment

'Living the life of a photographer chasing light is tiring. Living the life of a parent looking after a young child is tiring. 

'Combine the two, and it has the recipe to be even more exhausting. But combine them successfully, and it can be all the more rewarding,' Toh writes.

'We held on to the idea that we could introduce the natural world to our kids, stage by stage, by bringing them along on our photo shoots whenever - and wherever - possible.'

This shot, called 'A Henge Beneath' was taken at Murphy's haystacks, South Australia, estimated to be 1500 million years old

Toh writes about the importance of investing in a child carrier strong enough to enable a photographer to manipulate tripods, squat, sit and take long exposures with a child on their back, and stresses the need for safety.

'Without a child, we can take some calculated risks, like wading across deep streams, or standing on the edge of sea shelves and near cliff edges,' Toh writes. 

'Keep in mind that with a child on your back who is likely to wiggle unexpectedly, your balance is somewhat altered. Go slow and keep safe. That shot is not worth getting if you or your child stands to suffer for it.'

He also recommends sharing the workload with a partner, making sure kids have healthy distractions while on a long shoot, embracing compromise and modifying expectations. 

He sums up by saying that 'The kid must win. The overriding piece of advice that we give is that no matter the light, no matter the weather, the child’s needs should always come first.'

With the inspiring set of photographs this couple produced on their world trip, they must be doing something right.
