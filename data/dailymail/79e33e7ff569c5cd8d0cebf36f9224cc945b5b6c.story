The family of a senior British diplomat said today that his house may have been raided by counter terrorism police by ‘mistake’.

Sources close to Nicholas Sutcliffe, a first secretary to the Foreign Office, said officers may have ‘messed up’ after a mysterious tip-off.

His son James, 19, was arrested under counter terrorism legislation and the £650,000 family home ‘torn to pieces’ in a startling show of force by police.

'Torn apart': The home of senior British diplomat Nicholas Sutcliffe was raided by police over the weekend. His son James, 19, was arrested under counter terrorism legislation. Above, police are pictured outside the house

Another arrest: In a separate raid, Kuntal Patel (right), 36, the daughter of an east London magistrate, is believed to have been arrested, Left, an investigator sifts through material following one of the raids

Mistake? The family of Mr Sutcliffe, a first secretary to the Foreign Office, claim police may have 'messed up' after a tip-off. Above, tents are erected by police in the gardens of Mr Sutcliffe and a neighbouring property

However, the teenager was released on bail within hours and has now been told he will face no further action.

Dozens of officers, some wearing biohazard suits and using breathing equipment, spent four days searching the Sutcliffes' four-bedroom home and garden.

It is understood the extraordinary measures were taken because police feared chemical weapons could be stored there.

But following Mr Sutcliffe's arrest, one relative claimed Scotland Yard told him he had ‘nothing to worry about’.

Arrests: Police stand guard outside Mr Sutcliffe's house during the operation in leafy Streatham Hill. His son James was released on bail, with one relative claiming Scotland Yard said he had 'nothing to worry about''

Response: Dozens of officers spent four days searching the Sutcliffes' four-bedroom home and garden. Above, officers raid Mrs Patel's house in east London on January 26

Well equipped: Many of the police officers were wearing biohazard suits and using breathing equipment

A neighbouring property belonging to a 
family from Hong Kong was also searched during the operation in leafy 
Streatham Hill, South London.

It appears to be linked to a raid on magistrate Meena Patel's house in Stratford, East London, where a 36-year-old woman, believed to be her daughter, Kuntal, was also arrested under counter terrorism legislation.

Mr Sutcliffe's grandmother Marjorie Hunter said: ‘James has nothing to worry about. This is nothing to do with him. He has been told by the police that he has done nothing wrong.'

A friend of the teenager added: ‘I have been in contact with James. My understanding is it's all a bit of a mess–up.

‘He said the police realised pretty quickly that he had nothing to be accountable for.

Position: Mr Sutcliffe, a senior diplomat, was posted to Brazil in the early 1990s

Anger: The diplomat's sister-in-law Jenny described James's arrest as 'lunacy' and a 'mix-up'

‘There didn't seem to be any obvious 
connection between him and the woman who was arrested. He spends a lot 
of time playing games online which is how I know him.'

The teenager lives with his father Nicholas, 56, and his mother Carole, 54.

The couple have three other grown-up sons, two of whom are at university and one of whom lives in Japan.

Mr Sutcliffe, is described in the Diplomatic Service List as a ‘First Secretary’. He was posted to Brazil in the early 1990s and was then based in Havana, Cuba, before returning to Whitehall in 2001.

Planned operation: The arrests on Mr Sutcliffe and Miss Patel were made by police over the weekend

Scene: A neighbouring house belonging to a family from Hong Kong was also searched during the operation

Mr Sutcliffe's sister-in-law Jenny 
described James's arrest as ‘lunacy’ and suggested the entire operation 
was a ‘mix-up’. His brother Peter, 49, said it was ‘extraordinary’.

Meanwhile, the East London home of Mrs Patel, 54, remained at the centre of a search today and officers could be seen digging in the garden.

Her daughter Kuntal, who is believed to work in the City, remains in custody. Her younger sibling sister, Poonam, is a pharmacist.

Both Mr Sutcliffe and Miss Patel were arrested on suspicion of offences under the Anti–terrorism, Crime and Security Act, a rarely used piece of legislation.

A white Nissan Micra was taken away from the Stratford property on a low–loader and a skip in a house opposite was searched.

Local councillor Ron Manley, has known the Patels for more than 20 years, said: ‘They are a very upstanding family.

‘Meena is a magistrate and used to work for a local authority, Kuntal works in the City and her younger daughter Poonam is a pharmacist.

‘They are a Hindu family and I've known the two girls since they were at primary school. They have always been very polite, very nice girls.’

Mrs Patel sits on the bench at Thames magistrates' court in east London, where she has at least five years' experience.

She was recently involved in a local campaign to get neighbours to take part in a scheme to stop youths congregating on street corners.

Action: A Met spokesman said public safety was 'a priority' and people in the area didn't appear to be at risk

Facebook friends of Kuntal Patel include 
three people with the same name as the occupants of the neighbours to 
the Sutcliffe family.

Yesterday the Wong family, who are understood to have roots in Hong Kong, returned home after their house and garden had been searched before leaving again with suitcases.

A relative, who lives a short distance away, said: ‘They didn't do anything wrong, but it's not nice for all the neighbours to see the police there.

‘It's over now, they're OK now.’

In a statement, the Met police said: A 19-year-old man was arrested on 25 January on suspicion of an offence under the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001.

'He has been bailed to return until April, pending further enquiries.

'A 36-year-old woman was arrested later on 26 January on suspicion of an offence under the Act.

'She remains in custody at an east London police station.'

It added: 'Public safety is a priority and at this stage there is nothing to suggest members of the public in the immediate area are at risk.’
