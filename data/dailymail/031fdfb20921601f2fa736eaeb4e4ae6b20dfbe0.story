He is accustomed to staying at his large, private residence of Birkhall on the Balmoral Estate while in Scotland but today the Prince of Wales was given a taste of caravanning. 

Charles, known as the Duke of Rothesay in Scotland, spent a sunny couple of hours at Ballater Caravan Park, in Aberdeenshire, where he spoke with management and visitors.

The park was taken over from the local authority by a charitable organisation which has overseen a range of improvements.

Special guest: The prince inside Phyllis Stewart's static home

VIP: Norma Burnett and her husband joked that their caravan had never been so clean as they showed the royal around their home

The royal heard about life on the site near the River Dee as he was given a tour, popping into some caravans on the way.

Wearing a traditional kilt and sporran, he was given a warm welcome from residents who he paused to chat to and stopped to stroke one owner's dog.

Charles attended without the Duchess of Cornwall, who is coming to terms with the sudden death of her brother, Mark Shand, last week.

However, the engagement had always been intended to be a solo one for the prince, who left his wife at Birkhall.

One of the special guests at the royal visit was 100-year-old Alexander Alexander, known affectionately as 'double Sandy', who was there when the park began operating in the 1950s.

Mr Alexander said: 'I've seen so many changes here since I helped clear the site in the 50s. It was just me and my boss at the time, then before you know it, it's expanding. It's so great for the village.'

He joined Charles as he planted a tree outside the site's new wooden office, which replaces an outdated former Air Training Corps building.

Charles took a look around a static caravan owned by Norma Burnett, 70, and husband Bob, 72, who regularly visit from Peterculter, near Aberdeen.

Mrs Burnett said: 'He was very friendly and took an interest in the place. It was nice to have him visit.'

Mr Burnett joked: 'The caravan's never been so clean.'

Phyllis Stewart, of Springfield Gardens, Aberdeen, welcomed Charles into her caravan for a quick chat, and said: 'It was lovely to see him and he seemed to enjoy it. And he's picked a lovely day for a tour. If I'd known he was coming, I'd have put the kettle on.'

Dave Monk, 36, his wife Rachel, 40 and sons Dylan, seven, and Lewis, five, were among the first to speak to the Prince.

The family, from Blenheim in New Zealand, have been working their way around the world, spending this summer at the caravan park as wardens.

The two boys presented Charles with a New Zealand flag and a small toy kiwi.

Mr Monk said: 'Kate and William (the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge) just visited our home town and now we've got the future king of New Zealand here too. It's been great, and the kids have been excited.'
