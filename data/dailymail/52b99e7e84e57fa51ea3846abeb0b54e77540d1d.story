The wife of a Cabinet minister risked a security alert after accidentally posting her husband’s mobile phone number online.

Journalist Sarah Vine released the number of Education Secretary Michael Gove to her 5,000 followers.

Despite the bungle, aides say the senior Conservative will not be changing his number which he has had for years.

IT lessons: Education Secretary Michael Gove has his private mobile phone number posted on Twitter by his journalist wife Sarah Vine

The couple have been married since 2001 and have a son and a daughter.

She has often risked causing her husband embarrassment, using her newspaper column to reveal toe-curling secrets about their relationship.

She has claimed Mr Gove is ‘the worst driver in England, possibly the Western world’, accused him of being a ‘lunatic’ who scrapes the sauce off lasagne and revealed he ‘loves nothing more than a pair of dead man's trousers’ by shopping in charity shops.

In a late-night blunder on Twitter, Ms Vine thought she was sending a private message to another journalist.

But instead she posted his mobile number on the public website for anyone to see.

Sarah Vine is a prolific user of Twitter, but blundered after posting a the phone number on her timeline instead of sending a direct message to journalist

The message was intended for online magazine editor Milo Yiannopoulos who replied: ‘Might want to delete that tweet.’

The message was removed, but not before being seen by many users.

On tweeter, @thedharmblues, wrote: ‘Sarah Vine is married to Michael Gove, right? Has she just accidentally tweeted his mobile number?’

A source close to Mr Gove said the offending tweet was only visible for a few minutes.

The
source told The Sun: ‘It was meant to a direct message. Michael has had
the same number for years, so he's not going to change it.’

It
is not the first time the couple have had phone trouble. In September 
they accidentally took each other's iPhone to work after one of their 
children swapped the covers.

Mis-firing private messages on Twitter have caught out other politicians in the past.

Liberal Democrat Chris Huhne was left red-faced after apparently trying to tell a journalist he could not be linked to a story.

'From someone else fine but I do not want my fingerprints on the story', the then-Energy Secretary wrote in October 2011, before admitting he had made a 'fairly marginal' error.

Mr Gove's boss David Cameron famously warned of the perils of Twitter, when he blurted out on Absolute Radio that 'too many tweets might make a t***'.

However the PM has since gone back on his own advice and joined the microblogging website, quickly building more than 200,000 followers.
