Britain is to get its first 'hands-free' pedestrian crossing so that devout Jews do not have to break a religious law

Britain is to get its first ‘hands-free’ pedestrian
crossing – so that devout Jews do not have to break a religious law that
prohibits them from using electricity or operating machinery on the Sabbath.

The crossing is near a busy synagogue, and pressing a
button to operate it is considered a breach of the strict rules that apply to
Orthodox Jews.

Traffic will be held every 90 seconds from Friday evening
until nightfall on Saturday, covering the Jewish Sabbath period.

The crossing will be situated on one of London’s busiest roads – the North Circular at the
Henlys Corner junction. But planners insist it will not cause traffic chaos.

The system will come into operation in December when the
junction fully reopens after a massive ten-month upgrade costing £8 million.

The decision to include automatic crossings was taken
after leaders at Finchley United Synagogue explained their predicament to staff
at Transport for London, which is responsible for maintaining main roads in the
capital. TfL says the ‘hands-free’ green man has not added to the cost of
improvements.

A spokesman said: ‘We always consult with the community
over major road projects. This idea was suggested by the synagogue, whose
members asked if it could be done. We thought about it and came to the
conclusion that it could.’

No one at the synagogue was available for comment because
of the Jewish New Year. But one of the congregation said: ‘This is a sensible
idea that will make a real difference.’

The move follows the controversial formation of an eruv –
a boundary recognised by Jewish law within which certain activities are
permitted – in the same part of North London.

Although observant Jews are allowed to carry household
objects such as door keys, and to push prams and wheelchairs within the
six-square-mile area, they are still banned from using electricity.
