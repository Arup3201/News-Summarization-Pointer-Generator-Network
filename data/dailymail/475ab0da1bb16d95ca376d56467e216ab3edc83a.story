Nicolas Sarkozy is expected to be told he has to answer corruption charges over his connection to France's richest woman after he is cross-questioned by a judge tomorrow.

Judicial sources suggest the former French president is likely be placed under formal criminal investigation - the equivalent to being charged - following his appearance before judge Jean-Michel Gentil at the Palais de Justice in Bordeaux tomorrow.

Mr Sarkozy will be grilled at length by the Judge over his links with Liliane Bettencourt, the l'Oreal heiress and France's richest woman.

The principal allegation in the so-called 'Bettencourt Affair' is that Sarkozy accepted thousands of pounds in illegal cash to fund his election campaign in 2007.

In return, it is claimed, Mrs Bettencourt was offered massive tax breaks on her multi-million pounds fortune after Sarkozy came to power.

While some believe Sarkozy will be quizzed 'as a witness', judicial sources told AFP, France's national news agency, that 'he may be indicted'.

This would mean him facing the kind of criminal trial which his former mentor and predecessor as conservative president, Jacques Chirac, went through.

Chirac ended up receiving a suspended prison sentence for fraud last December, becoming the first head of state in the history of the Fifth Republic to be treated as a common criminal.

In Sarkozy's case, Judge Gentil is examining evidence that Sarkozy 'abused the weakness' of Mrs Bettencourt, who celebrates her 90th birthday today.

Investigators are examining the withdrawal of hundreds of thousands of euros from Swiss bank accounts, and the claim that cash was delivered in brown envelopes.

Sarkozy, who lost May's presidential election to Socialist Francois Hollande, has denied a series of allegations of illegal campaign financing.

Police raided the Paris mansion Sarkozy shares with his third wife, Carla Bruni, in July - just weeks after he lost his presidential immunity from prosecution.

Sarkozy's legal troubles mounted on Tuesday when it emerged that judges are investigating millions he spent on opinion polls when he was president.

The allegation is that he enriched friends who produced the polls, many of which were used for personal reasons including gauging how popular Carla Bruni was as first lady.

Sarkozy is also being probed over the Karachi Affair - a fraud enquiry centred on submarine sales to Pakistan - and allegations that he received millions from former Libyan despot Muammar Gaddafi.

Despite all this, Sarkozy has not ruled out running for president again in 2017, and is attempting to set himself up as an international speaker in the Tony Blair and Bill Clinton mould.

Sarkozy's aides said he was delivering a speech in London today - suggesting that he will travel direct to Bordeaux from the UK.
