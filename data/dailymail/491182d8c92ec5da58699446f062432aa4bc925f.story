Unknown: Identity of 82-year-old arrested in Jimmy Savile investigation is still kept secret

The identity of a household-name celebrity arrested by the Jimmy Savile police squad was being kept a mystery  last night.

The 82-year-old star was detained on suspicion of sexual offences by officers from Operation Yewtree.

He was questioned on Thursday and released on police bail to a date in May pending further inquiries.

Yesterday neither he nor his agent or lawyers responded to requests for comment.

There were four cars on the gated drive of the celebrity’s riverside house in Berkshire, and people could be seen inside, but nobody would comment.

When a reporter identified himself over the intercom, a woman said: ‘Good for you.’

The star was first interviewed under caution on November 29 last year.

That month, officers also executed a search warrant.

The entertainer is one of 11 people arrested so far under Operation Yewtree, the Metropolitan Police’s £1million investigation sparked by Savile’s decades of offending.

Scotland Yard said the arrested man falls into the category of its investigation termed ‘others’.

This means he is suspected of sexual offences that are not connected to Savile’s offending.

Earlier this week, the Mail revealed that as few as three of the 11 men arrested by Scotland Yard over suspected sex offences in the Savile case are likely to be charged.

Details of the small number of likely Yewtree prosecutions emerged a day after a former BBC producer was released without charge following his arrest over an alleged sex assault in 1965.

Wilfred De’Ath, 75, who spent four months on bail before being cleared, accused police of being ‘over-zealous’, pursuing ‘spurious’ claims, and failing ‘lamentably’ to stop Savile’s reign of terror while he was still alive.

Arrested: Both PR guru Max Clifford, left, and DJ Dave Lee Travis have been arrested by Yewtree detectives

The police operation, which has 30 dedicated detectives, has been criticised by some as a ‘celebrity witch-hunt’.

There has been growing speculation that comedian Freddie Starr could soon be told that he, too, will not be charged. He strenuously denies claims that he attempted to grope a 14-year-old girl in Savile’s BBC changing room in 1974.

If, as seems likely, only a handful of men are charged, there are sure to be uncomfortable questions for the police over the probe.

Yard chiefs insist all arrests by the Yewtree detectives were ‘necessary and proportionate’.

Other celebrities arrested by the Yewtree squad include the comedian Jim Davidson, PR guru Max Clifford and disgraced pop star Gary Glitter, all of whom deny wrongdoing.

Davidson, 59, was detained over historic sex allegations – not involving children – shortly before he was due to appear on Celebrity Big Brother in January and rearrested last week over new allegations dating back to 1978.

DJ Dave Lee Travis, 67, was also rearrested over sex allegations involving adults. He too denies wrongdoing.

Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.
