This is Ceyda Sungar, 'The Woman in Red' who became the symbol of Turkish protests after she was tear-gassed by police

This is the first picture of the Turkish academic since she became the unwitting icon of the country's mass protests after she was pictured being sprayed with tear gas.

Dubbed 'The Woman in Red' because she was wearing an elegant red dress when she was gassed, Ceyda Sungar has said she is uncomfortable with her fame and has no desire to be a figurehead of the movement.

'There are a lot of people who were at the park and they were also tear-gassed,' she told Turkey's TV24. 'There is no difference between them and I.'

Nevertheless, pictures have reverberated 
around the world of Miss Sungar, an academic in city planning at Istanbul Technical University, turning away from massed riot police as one officer sprays
 tear gas at her face.

Endlessly
 shared on social media and recreated as artwork on posters and 
stickers, the image - dubbed 'The Woman in Red' - has become the 
leitmotif for female protesters at recent violent anti-government riots 
in Istanbul.

But 
the academic, who is part of the Taksim Solidarity Platform protesting 
against the redevelopment of the park, has shied away from media 
attention.

She is believed to be uncomfortable with 
her position as the focal point of the movement - although her image 
alone has become a galvanising force for fellow protesters.

In the early hours of this morning 
thousands of protesters were digging in for a fresh weekend of 
demonstrations Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan's demand for an immediate 
end to the worst political unrest of his decade in power.

In
 central Istanbul's Taksim Square, where riot police backed by 
helicopters and armoured vehicles clashed with protesters a week ago, 
activists spent the night in a makeshift protest camp.

They slept in tents and vandalised buses, or wrapped themselves in blankets under the shelter of plane trees.

What began as a campaign against the 
redevelopment of Gezi Park in a corner of Taksim Square spiralled into 
an massive display of public rage over the perceived authoritarianism of
 Mr Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted AK Party.

Worst unrest in a decade of power: Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan has called on protesters to immediately clear the streets

Police firing tear gas and water cannon have clashed with groups of protesters night after night in Istanbul, Ankara and other cities across the country for much of the past week, leaving three dead and some 4,000 injured.

Mr Erdogan yesterday demanded an immediate end to the protests, saying they were founded on a 'campaign of lies.'

He has branded the demonstrators as looters and has said the protests are being manipulated by 'terrorist' groups.

There are rumours that among the liberal protesters there are far-Right nationalists who seek a return to the kind of militant secularism that saw Turkish politics dominated in the 20th century by a string of military dictatorships.

Mr Erdogan gave no indication of any immediate plans to remove the tent villages that have appeared in Taksim and a park in the capital, Ankara.

But the gatherings mark a challenge to a leader whose authority is built on three successive election victories.

'Let them attack, they can't stop us,' shouted a member of the Turkish Communist Party, shouting through loudspeakers to a cheering crowd from on top of a white van in Taksim Square.

'The AK Party will go. This will be the end.'

The protesters have built barricades of 
paving stones and corrugated iron on access roads to Taksim to try to 
protect themselves against a potential police assault. But their actions
 have brought gridlock to part of central Istanbul and it is unclear how
 long the authorities will tolerate their presence.

The square is lined by luxury hotels that should be doing a roaring trade as the summer season starts in one of the world's most-visited cities. But a forced eviction could trigger a repeat of the clashes seen earlier in the week.

During his decade in power, Mr Erdogan has enacted many democratic reforms, taming a military that toppled four governments in four decades, starting entry talks with the European Union, reining in rights abuses by police and forging peace talks with Kurdish rebels to end a three-decade-old war that has cost 40,000 lives.

Per-capita income has tripled in nominal terms and business has boomed under his rule.

But in recent years, critics say his style, always forceful and emotional, has become authoritarian.

Media have come under pressure, and the arrests of military and other figures over alleged coup plots as well as moves such as restrictions on alcohol sales have unsettled especially secular middle-class Turks who are sensitive to any encroachment of religion on their daily lives.

The fierce crackdown, condemned by foreign powers, on what started as peaceful protests in Gezi Park were the final straw, has caused simmering frustrations with Erdogan's leadership to boil over.

'These protests are partly a result of his success in economic and social transformation. There's a new generation who doesn't want to be bullied by the prime minister and who is afraid their lifestyle is in danger,' said Joost Lagendijk, a former European parliamentarian and Istanbul-based academic.

Sources close to the AK Party that Mr Erdogan founded in 2001, and which only a year later crushed traditional secular parties in elections, suggest a sense of siege within the leadership, with influential if disparate forces keen to remove Erdogan.

Citing a party source, the Radikal newspaper said an AK Party executive meeting on Saturday may discuss the possibility of calling early elections, although it could also change party rules to enable Mr Erdogan to seek a fourth term as prime minister rather than running for the presidency.

Mr Erdogan has made clear he has no intention of stepping aside - pointing to the AK Party's 50 percent of the vote in the last election - and he has no clear rivals inside the party or outside, with the opposition fragmented on the streets and in parliament.
