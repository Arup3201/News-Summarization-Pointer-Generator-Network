This is the heart-warming moment an orangutan who lost an arm after it became trapped in a snare for ten days is released back into the wild.

The young male named Pelansi had tried to gnaw his own hand off after the limb become ensnared by the hunter's trap.

Luckily a rescue team found him in time to save his life - but the hand and part of his right arm had to be amputated.

Fear: Animal medics were worried Pelansi wouldn't pull through when he was first found as his condition was so severe

Complex: Animal medics had to perform difficult surgery to remove Pelansi's hand and arm which could not be saved

Horrifying: Pelansi had tried to gnaw his own hand off in a desperate attempt to be free from the snare

Following months of treatment and rehabilitation he is now fully 
recovered and is back where he belongs in the forests of West Kalimantan
in Indonesian Borneo.

The International Animal Rescue team found Pelansi severely 
dehydrated and barely clinging to life near a palm plantation in April.

His trapped hand had become necrotic and he had injured his elbow in his desperate attempts to free himself from the trap.

Under threat: Campaigners say Pelansi's story is a telling example of how orangutans are being threatened by the palm oil industry in Borneo

In the first few days, animal medics were worried he wouldn't pull through.

But after complex surgery to amputate his hand, Pelansi has battled 
back and vets think he should be able to lead a normal life.

Campaigners say the incident highlights how palm oil production is killing off the habitat of the orangutan by clearing forest in order to make more room to grow the crop.

According to International Animal Rescue, the land where Pelansi was found is home to a large number of orangutans that have fled from a new palm oil plantation.

Palm oil is a widely used in cosmetics and processed food.

Alan Knight, from International Animal Rescue, said : 'We have all been eagerly awaiting the day of Pelansi’s release.

'When endangered species like the orangutan are in crisis, every single individual counts.

'Pelansi’s story is cause for celebration, not only because his life has 
been saved, but also because his reintroduction into the wild is a small
but symbolic step in support of orangutan conservation.'
