Port Vale boss Rob Page told The Sentinel: 'There is no deal at the minute. He has been out in India playing and has come back. He needs to get fit so he has been in training with us so it is something we will be looking at.

'Fitness is a factor with him at the minute. He has quality, you could see in training on Thursday that he still has an eye for goal and you never lose that quality.

'He is a talented footballer and he is only 31. So, maybe if we can benefit from his experience and knowledge of the game, then we might look at it.'
