Ski resorts in Europe are continuing to struggle with a lack of snow - which has seen the cancellation of a series of World Cup alpine races.

The French resort of Val d'Isere was forced to abandon the event, due to take place on December 10 and 11, because of the balmy autumn which has this year beleaguered the continent.

Its slopes, seen here in these staggeringly barren photographs, have been badly affected by the warmest and driest autumn in the Alps for 147 years.

Snow go area: The Val D'Isere resort in France has had the World Cup alpine event taken away from it because it has no snow

Barren: The normally crisp white landscape is instead brown and green because of a lack of snow

It's snow joke: Skiers walk around the resort of Val D'Isere in a state of bemusement because there is no snow

Barren: The slopes of Val D'Isere, seen here in these staggering photographs, have been badly affected by the warmest and driest autumn in the Alps for 147 years

As it should be: Val D'Isere is usually covered in snow during the ski season

Solden, Austria: There was a reported 0 - 61cm of snow today, said to be of 'good' condition. The resort says snow is guaranteed from October through to May thanks to the high alpine location of the 148 km of slopes and the two glacier ski areas of Rettenbach and Tiefenbach. Ischgl, Austria: This resort in the ski region of Ischgl-Samnaun in Tyrol opened today and has 77km of slopes with 24 open lifts. As of this morning, much of this was artificial snow but skiiers haven't complained so far.Sierra Nevada, Spain: Surprisingly, this resort in the south-east of Spain has some good snow, particularly on the upper slopes. They are reporting a metre of snow on the upper regions with 41km of skiable pistes.Les Deux Alpes, France: According to the Ski Club of Great Britain's website, Les Deux Alpes were reporting 'a healthy 80cm upper slope depth' - good news as the resort opens on Saturday.Zermatt, Switzerland: This resort opens tomorrow when skiers can enjoy 141km of pistes. Zermatt's website says that the snow conditions are 'top' on the Swiss side and Italian side of the resort.  In fact, it boasts: 'We’ve got snow, great snow!'

The hotter than usual weather is also
posing problems across the rest of the continent, with a number of 
tourist destinations having had to postpone opening.

St
Anton, in Austria, will not open for at least another week, and 
Skiwelt, also in Austria, will not be taking skiers until December 15.

In
other areas the situation is so bad that people who have not yet booked
their trips are being advised to only consider resorts with 
high-altitude ski areas.

This is because springlike temperatures mean the snow line for many resorts is far higher than usual.

Scotland, Bulgaria and Germany have yet to open their main resorts. But it is not all bad news for European skiers.

Scandinavia has reported up to 55cm of snow in the past week, Zermatt in Switzerland is fully open, and Solden saw 24cm of fresh snow yesterday.

Al Morgan, information manager from the Ski Club of Great Britain said skiers should look to glacier resorts to be guaranteed snow but there are some non-glacial locations across Europe where you can still ski.

He said: 'There is good news for European ski resorts as snow is forecast for this weekend and next week.

'The heaviest snowfall is expected to fall at the western European resorts, but resorts in the east should receive fresh snow too.

'Around 40cm of new snow could fall over the next nine days in parts of France and Switzerland. The fresh snow should dramatically improve the overall snow cover across the Alps.

'Even without the fresh snow, many European resorts are hoping to open for the winter season this coming weekend thanks to the great efforts of grooming and snow making teams.

'It has been snowing in Scotland this week too and if the snowfall continues, as it is forecast to, then the Scottish resorts should be able to open in the not too distant future.'

The Met Office said that a cold front was expected over mainland Europe by the end of this week, starting tomorrow.

Its report said: 'A glorious week of bright sunshine and clear skies is expected over the majority of our featured European resorts.

Far too green: These snowless slopes on the Rosshuette mountain in the western Austrian village of Seefeld were pictured last week

'However, on Friday 2nd December a 
drop in temperature is expected, snow is therefore forecast to fall, 
although this may only be across higher areas up.'

But
it warned that: 'At lower altitudes this could fall as rain.' The snow 
is expected to fall and settle at heights above 1,500m.

Over
in America, where the World Cup races will now take place at Beaver 
Creek resort in Colorado, there has been no such problem.

The
start of the North American ski season has seen a much better 1.2m fall
of snow on West Coast runs and up to 60cm of new powder on the East 
Coast.
