Hundreds of thousands of mothers-to-be should give birth at home or in midwife-led units rather than in hospital, the health watchdog says.

Almost half of the 700,000 women who have babies every year in England and Wales are at such low risk of complications they do not need to visit the labour ward, says NICE.

New guidelines published today say a smaller, midwife-led unit is just as safe as hospital for first-time mothers.

For those having their second child, a home delivery is just as safe as in hospital and usually a far more joyful experience.

Yet figures show that just 2.3 per cent of women currently have home deliveries and a further 4 per cent in midwife units, while the remainder head to hospital.

It marks a major shift in guidelines, which had previously urged caution over home births as the risks were deemed higher.

The watchdog says it has now examined new evidence, including an Oxford University study of 64,000 women, which showed that home births and units were safer because they are less likely to involve high-risk interventions such as caesarean sections, epidurials or deliveries with forceps.

Such procedures may be carried out too readily by doctors, while midwives are thought to have a more patient approach, it says.

The research did, however, show that home births are marginally more dangerous for the baby for first-time mothers – although the risks are very small. Avoiding hospital also saves the NHS money. Figures show that a hospital birth costs £1,631, while it costs £1,450 for a midwife centre and £1,066 for a home birth.

However, NICE stressed that new evidence on risk – and not cost – was the reason for the change.

Professor Mark Baker, NICE’s clinical practice director, said: ‘Most women are healthy and have straightforward pregnancies and births. Over the years, evidence has emerged which shows that, for this group of women, giving birth in a midwife-led unit instead of a traditional labour ward is a safe option.

Mothers are being warned that falling asleep with their babies while breastfeeding in bed is linked to cot death.

The health watchdog NICE says it increases the risk of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS), although it stopped short of telling women not to sleep with their newborns because it may interfere with breastfeeding.

It said exhausted parents should not feel guilty if they find they have accidentally nodded off with the baby, but must be aware of the ‘association’ with SIDS.

Experts are not clear what causes SIDS, previously known as cot death, but it may be due to suffocation, infection or genetics.

Professor Mark Baker of NICE admitted it was a ‘confusing’ message, but added: ‘We’re not telling people not to co-sleep with their babies, we know that could get in the way with breastfeeding, but it’s better that parents should know and make their own judgments.’

‘Research also shows that a home birth is generally safer than hospital for pregnant women at low risk of complications who have given birth before.’

Professor Susan Bewley, who drew up the guidelines, said birth was now ‘mostly’ safe but said there is no ‘one size fits all’ choice of location during labour.

She added: ‘Some women may prefer to have their baby at home or in a midwife-led unit because they are generally safer – that is their right and they should be supported in that choice.

‘But if a woman would prefer to have her baby in a hospital because it makes her feel ‘safer’, that is also her right.’

NICE said that overall, giving birth at home or in midwife-led units was a far happier experience. However, women who are obese or have asthma, diabetes or epilepsy or who have had a previous difficult birth are urged to go to hospital.

Midwives and GPs are now urged to spell out the options open to women and make it clear that hospitals are not necessarily safest.

Professor Alan Cameron, of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, said there was now better emphasis on patient choice.

Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the Royal College of Midwives, added: ‘It is important that women feel able to make the choices that are right for them.’
