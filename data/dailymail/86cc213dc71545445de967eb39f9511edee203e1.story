Romulus the Donkey is set to beat the Guinness World Record as the World's Tallest Donkey.

Measured by a local vet in Texas, Romulus is an incredible 68 inches tall, 2 inches taller than previous holder Oklahoma Sam.

Romulus and his twin Remus were rescued by owners Phil and Cara Yellott when their previous owner could not afford to look after them.

Gangly: Romulus the Donkey, towering above his proud owner Cara Yellott, looks set to beat the Guinness World Record for the World's Tallest Donkey, as he measured two inches taller than his nearest rival Oklahoma Sam

Mr Yellott said that when they found Romulus and Remus on trading website Craig’s List, they immediately wanted to buy them:

'We saw their pictures and really fell in love with them.'

He said the owners delivered the two donkeys just in time for Cara’s birthday.

The couple use the twins as guard donkeys.

'When we moved to Waxahachie back in 
October we wanted to get a couple of donkeys to help protect our other 
animals,' Mr Yellott explained.

'They protect 
horses and cows from coyotes and other animals.'

Preparing for the limelight: Romulus will now be making press and personal appearances in his role as world's tallest donkey

Mrs Yellott, who works as a riding 
instructor in Waxahachie, Texas said she was very worried about Romulus 
when he first arrived.

She said: 'He was severely underweight, but he’s coming along'.

Vet Dr Valerie Jaffey concluded last month that Mammoth Jackstock Donkey Romulus stood at 17 hands.

Her results must be certified by Guinness World Records before it becomes official.

However, Romulus already has a busy schedule of local events to attend in his role as the world's tallest donkey.
