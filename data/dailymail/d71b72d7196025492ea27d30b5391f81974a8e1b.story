As historic landmarks go, it hardly ranks as a world heritage site.

There’s a simple swathe of grass around the remains of some summer flowerbeds, and the rusty old signpost in the middle has clearly seen service for generations.

Granted, it’s only a roundabout. But for the past 185 years there has always been something rather comforting to the good folk of Leek about the island that stands at the entrance to their town.

Protest: Dozens of local residents have set up camp on a historic roundabout in Leek, Staffordshire, in a bid to stop the council replacing it with traffic lights

Taking a stand: The campaigners, including Philip Kent (pictured), are fighting to save the island in the picturesque market town, which has stood for 185 years

So much so that when highway planners announced a scheme to get rid of it, they mounted a fearless campaign to save it.

Elderly ladies joined furious traders  and young mums to occupy the site on a 24-hour rota.

Tents were pitched where pelargoniums
once bloomed; demonstrators started a sit-in (a sit-on, to be 
technically correct); organisers hoisted a Union Flag and arrived with 
banners and placards.

Then they vowed that in the matter of
the people versus Staffordshire County Council – much like traffic at 
the five-way junction the roundabout commands – the dispute would be 
going only one way.

One told the Daily Mail the 
roundabout was as much a part of the market town’s geography as the 
memorial clock tower overlooking it.

Another said she would refuse to move
until a public inquiry threw out what she described as a ‘ridiculous, 
insensitive and unnecessary’ redevelopment.

The £5million revamp is part of a 
planning application for a new Sainsbury’s and the ‘regeneration’ of the
surrounding area. The supermarket is paying for the work and the county
council has devised a scheme to accommodate it.

An architect’s impression of how it 
would look shows pedestrians strolling in leafy, traffic-free zones and 
cars waiting obediently at traffic lights – but no roundabout.

Claim: The protesters say the land that the roundabout is built on was bought by Leek Town Lands Trusts for £100 in 1827 on behalf of the people and therefore cannot be developed

Shift work: More than 60 residents now take it in turns to occupy the roundabout 24 hours a day by sleeping in ten tents which are pitched on the island

Landmark: The roundabout was originally a meeting place for traders entering the town in the 19th century

A council press release trumpets: 
‘The changes will help the town centre cope with expected increases in 
traffic due to this and other  new developments that aim to revive the 
local economy.’

It said the plan would provide better views and improved access to the Nicholson war memorial, the tallest in  the country.

But the proposals have sparked a 
minor revolution in Leek (motto: Arte favente nil desperandum – our 
skill assisting us, we have no cause for despair).

Some 1,500 people joined a protest march and more than 1,100 signed a petition to save the roundabout from destruction.

The council has applied for an eviction notice.

Meanwhile a legal wrangle has been 
going through the courts after residents claimed the roundabout – 
originally an island meeting place for 19th century traders – stands on
land owned by an ancient trust.

Roger Cannon, representing protesters at a county court hearing last week, said the land was bought for £100 in 1827.

Council lawyers argued it had been part of a highway since 1879.

Protester Sarah said: ‘I think it is absolutely disgusting. We’re standing here doing our democratic right to protest.

‘Once this is all over, the people 
that have let this town down . . . are going to absolutely regret 
messing with the people of Leek.’
