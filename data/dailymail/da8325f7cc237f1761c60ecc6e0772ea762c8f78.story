With just over a month to go until the mega fight between Manny Pacquiao and Floyd Mayweather, legendary trainer Nacho Beristain believes that 'Pac-Man' has a chance of winning - and gives him a 45 per cent chance.

Juan Manuel Marquez's trainer is a fan of the hard-hitting Filipino and likes his intelligence, hand speed and ability to throw combinations.

With Mayweather's defence the best in the world, Beristain knows it'll be a tough ask but thinks that if Pacquiao boxes smart then he has an opportunity.

'I believe that Pacquiao has 45 per cent of a chance; Mayweather is the favorite but by very little,' Beristain told ESPN Deportes.

'I always liked more Pacquiao for commercial style, which people pay with pleasure to see him fight, and the other [Mayweather], we already know it, a defensive, style that is kind of weird.'

'On paper who looks the best is Mayweather,' Beristain added. 'The knockout by Juan Manuel of Manny [in 2012]. But Pacquiao has many things in its favour – the speed, and being a smart fighter. Even though people think otherwise, he knows when to shoot his combinations.'

With training heavily ongoing for the two fighters, Pacquiao was visited by NFL quarterback Tim Tebow at the gym in Los Angeles.

The two athletes have a lot in common, with both of them strong Christians and being born in the Philippines. 

Tebow took to Instagram to show the stars spending time together during his training session.

He posted: 'Awesome being with my Filipino and Christian brother.' 

Floyd Mayweather is also in full flow with his training regime but took some time out to post a photo where he looked relaxed ahead of the upcoming $300million fight.
