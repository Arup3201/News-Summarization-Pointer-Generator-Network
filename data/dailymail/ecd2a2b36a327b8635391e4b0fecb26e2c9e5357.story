Manchester City have completed the £12m signing of Brazilian defensive midfielder Fernando from Porto.

A short statement released by the club on Wednesday evening confirmed the 26-year-old, who has been at the Portuguese giants since 2007, has made the switch to Manchester.

The statement, send by Porto to the Portuguese Securities Market Commission (CMVM), read: 'FC Porto hereby informs the market that it has reached an agreement with Manchester City for the permanent transfer of professional footballer Fernando Reges for 15million euros.'

Fernando Francisco Reges, to give him his full name, had signed a contract extension until 2019 back in February.

But City, having tried to sign the player in January, have now been given the green light for a deal worth £12m.

Porto sent a letter to the stock exchange confirming Fernando's transfer to the Premier League champions, along with the fee of €15m (£12m).

Fernando is City's second signing of the summer after Bacary Sagna's free transfer from Arsenal.

Fernando would give City manager Manuel Pellegrini an extra midfield option in addition to Yaya Toure, Fernandinho and Javi Garcia.

With City restricted to a net spend of £49million this summer as punishment for breaching UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations, such a deal could represent good value.
