Multi-millionaire Roisin Isaacs has given an inordinate amount of time and energy to two places in recent years.

One is the deprived Hilltown quarter of Dundee. The other – her private passion – is Pennlands Kiln. The farmhouse, dating from 1862, was in a dilapidated state when she bought it, but she has devoted the past years to restoring it to its full glory.

Northern Ireland-born Roisin, who made her fortune in occupational health after moving to England at 18 to study as a nurse, took part in Channel 4’s Secret Millionaire series in 2009.

She lived on job-seekers’ allowance in Dundee, using the city’s food bank, while learning about the work of certain charities there. She ended up donating £40,000 to two of them.

‘I was brought up by my grandparents in Bessbrook, near Newry, in very humble circumstances,’ she says, pouring tea in her comfortable drawing room.

‘And being in Dundee brought back memories of those days, when my grandfather, a gorgeous guy, also struggled to get the next meal on the table. It struck me that I should give something back.

By the time I returned home to Pennlands Kiln, I was less of a capitalist and more of a philanthropist.’

Roisin, 59, first saw Pennlands Kiln, which stands in glorious isolation outside Farnham Common in leafy Buckinghamshire, in 1998.

She paid £700,000 for the property and, even though it had a horrible 1970s look and birds were actually nesting in the upstairs rooms, she immediately wanted this to be the house where she would live.

So she forked out another £750,000 on a renovation project, hiring top London interior designer Beverley Barnett and reading up on the property’s history to ensure none of the changes damaged the fabric of the house.

Now Pennlands Kiln is a more chic version of the Victorian original. The drawing room, which had the appearance of a cheap mock-Tudor saloon bar when she first saw it, is now tastefully decorated in creams and gold, with an impressive open fireplace.

Across the hall and down the corridor there is a tiny sitting room on the left which Roisin describes as ‘the smallest cinema in the world’, and opposite is a dark, formal dining room. ‘People used to design rooms for different times of the day,’ she says. ‘And this is a night-time room.’

Straight ahead there is the white-washed farmhouse kitchen with its light oak furnishings and huge range.

According to her research, the farm labourers in Victorian times would call by for their food – and be handed it out of the kitchen window.

Next to the kitchen the farm animals’ winter quarters have been turned into a high-tech office where Roisin’s partner Andrew Griffiths pores over computer screens, with the family’s pair of Tibetan terriers, Blarney and Willie, at his feet.

One recurring feature in the house are the stencilled mottos and quotations which adorn many of the rooms.

One of these – ‘Happiness unshared is scarcely happiness’ – seems particularly apt for this Secret Millionaire. What, I wonder, did she learn from making the documentary?

‘I learnt that poverty and hunger are very dangerous,’ she says, leading the way out into the gardens.

‘If you can’t eat, you can’t think. If you can’t think, you can’t work and if you can’t work, you can’t help yourself.’

However, Roisin does not believe food banks and financial handouts alone will solve the problems of the country’s poor.

‘It’s a generational thing and we have lost some of our skills base,’ she says. ‘People should be taught in schools how to budget and how to make, say, a broth from inexpensive ingredients. Maybe that’s not the job of the teachers – maybe the charities should do it. But somebody must provide an education at this level.’

Although she was on The Secret Millionaire, there is nothing remotely hair-shirt or holier-than-thou about Roisin.

A self-confessed party lover, one of her happiest memories of her time at the house is of the fancy-dress dance she held two years ago, when she packed 75 people, all in Victorian costume, into a giant marquee in the grounds. She also has a penchant for creating ‘refreshment’ areas outside.

There is a special ‘gin and tonic’ table  set above an 18ft waterfall, a champagne-quaffing corner for pre-dinner drinks in a thatched safari hut and an afternoon tea table up on some turrets, next to her hot tub.

The property is now on the market for £2.35 million, and sitting in ‘gin and tonic’ corner, looking over this impressive five-bedroom home, it is difficult to resist the question: Why move?

‘I sold my main company last year and although I have a property portfolio and a brand development company to keep me interested, I want to semi-retire,’ she says. ‘I love Billingshurst and West Sussex so I’d like to move there.’

Roisin does charity work – for Alabare, which supports vulnerable women, and the Trussell Trust food banks – which she will continue, but there is also something else that will occupy her: ‘I have one unfulfilled ambition: to write children’s stories.’
