Israeli naval forces have raided a 
ship in the Red Sea and seized dozens of advanced rockets from Iran which they claim were
destined for Palestinian militants in Gaza.

The weapons cache would have significantly boosted their ability to strike Israeli citizens, the military said.

The
 ship carrying Syrian-made rockets was intercepted more than 1,000 miles
 south of Israel, off the coasts of Sudan and Eritrea.

The
 M-302 rockets have a range of up to 100 miles and would have 
significantly improved the capabilities of Gaza militants, putting 
nearly all of Israel in their range, a military spokesman said.

Previously, Gaza militants have only been able to reach about 50 miles into Israel with their home grown M-75 missiles.

There was no immediate comment from Iran or Gaza's Hamas rulers about the Israeli claims.

Israeli
 prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is visiting the US this week, 
held a series of talks with Israeli defence officials ahead of the 
ship's takeover.

He later 
spoke out against international relationships between Iran and western 
countries and warned that may go nuclear after sanctions have been 
relaxed.

‘At a time when
 it talks with the world powers, at a time when Iran is smiling and 
saying all sorts of pleasantries, that same Iran is sending lethal 
weapons to terror organisations and it is doing it with an elaborate 
network of covert global operations with the aim of streaming rockets, 
missiles and other lethal weapons to harm innocent civilians'

Threat: The M-302 rockets have a range of up to 100 miles and would put nearly all of Israel in their range if they had reached their believed final destination, the Israeli army said

Video
 released by the military showed Israeli soldiers on the ship inspecting
 the rockets, shipped in large crates. The video also showed beige bags 
containing cement with the words ‘Made in I.R. Iran,’ in English, 
written on them.

Israeli defence minister Moshe Yaalon said the weapons headed for Gaza were ‘strategically important’.

‘Iran
 trains, funds and arms terror groups in the region and around the world
 and its failed attempts to transfer the arms that were discovered this 
morning is more proof of that,’ he said.

The
 operation, codenamed Full Disclosure, followed months of intelligence 
gathering. The spokesman said the shipment originated in Syria, after 
which the weapons were transported to Iran and then out to sea via Iraq.

The
 shipment was destined for Sudan, from where it was to be moved overland
 through Egypt to Gaza, the army said.  Israel claims militants have 
used similar routes in the past.

The
 17 crew members of the ship, flying under a Panama flag, were not 
suspects and were probably unaware of the content of their cargo, he 
added.

The vessel was being
 brought to the port of Eilat, Israel's most southerly point, where the 
crew would be released and the cache unloaded. It was expected to arrive
 later this week.

Israel 
accuses Iran of supplying rockets and other arms to its foes - militants
 in Gaza and Lebanon's Hezbollah - and it has moved to intercept weapons
 shipments in the past.

Three
 years ago, Israel seized the cargo ship Victoria loaded with weapons 
allegedly sent by Iran to Gaza militants, including land-to-sea 
missiles.

In November 2009, 
Israel took over the Iranian Francop vessel off the coast of Cyprus and 
captured hundreds of tons of rockets, missiles, mortars, grenades and 
anti-tank weapons on board that it said were headed to Hezbollah 
guerrillas in Lebanon.

Israel
 is also suspected of carrying out airstrikes in Sudan on arms shipments
 believed to be bound for Gaza. Israel has never confirmed carrying out 
the strikes.

In January 
2002, Israeli forces stormed the Karine A freighter on the Red Sea, and 
confiscated what the military said was 50 tons of missiles, mortars, 
rifles and ammunition headed for Palestinian militants in the Gaza 
Strip.

In May 2001, Israel 
captured the vessel Santorini off its coastline, packed with explosives 
Israel said were being sent from Hezbollah to Palestinian militant 
groups.

Israel's foreign 
ministry said Israeli troops boarded the ship in accordance with 
international law and with the consent of the crew and the relevant 
authorities. It said the ship was operated by a company registered in 
the Marshall Islands.

‘The 
missiles and weapons found on the ship were loaded and concealed by 
Iran,’ it said. ‘The weapons were intended for Palestinian terror groups
 in Gaza, who would use it to harm Israeli civilians, as they have done 
in the past.’

It added that 
Israel will lodge a formal complaint with the United Nations Security 
Council and with a sanctions committee established under Security 
Council resolution 1737.

‘In
 terms of maritime law we have the right to board a ship we identify as 
dealing with terror, carrying weapons that are meant to endanger the 
state of Israel,’ Yedidia Yaari, a former chief of Israel's navy, told 
Israeli Channel 10 TV.

Another
 former navy chief, Vice Admiral Eliezer Marom, said Iran's smuggling 
efforts to Israel's enemies was almost a daily activity. He said it was 
orchestrated by a special unit of the ‘Quds Force’, part of the 
Revolutionary Guards.

‘There
 are people waking up very day and their mission is to smuggle weapons 
to the terrorist organisations so they will be directed to the citizens 
of Israel,’ he said.
