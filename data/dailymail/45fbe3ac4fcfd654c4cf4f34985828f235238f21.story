Mahmoud Yousef Hindi, a former doctor from Louisville, Kentucky, was found hanged in his police cell on Saturday afternoon while awaiting trail for the murder of two neighbours

A man awaiting trial for the alleged murder of two of his neighbours has hung himself in his cell.

Mahmoud Yousef Hindi, a former doctor educated in Jordan, was being held at Louisville Metro Department of Corrections in Kentucky when he committed suicide by hanging himself.

Centre director Mark Bolton said Hindi was not on suicide watch, and was seen praying 10 minutes before his body was found at 3.55pm on Saturday.

He added that workers had performed CPR before taking Hindi to a medical centre, but he was pronounced dead around an hour later.

In September last year Hindi allegedly shot two of his neighbours dead a homeowners' meeting inside Springdale Community Church.

Association president David Merritt, 73, and member Marvin Fisher, 69, were thought to have been targeted because of a long-running dispute over a driveway and fence they claimed Hindi had built without proper planning permission.

Around 20 people were inside the church when the killings took place, including a bible group, though nobody else was hurt.

The housing association had taken Hindi to court multiple times and Hindi became so frustrated he wrote a note threatening to shoot any trespassers on his property, before taking a loaded gun to the meeting.

Hindi's driveway (pictured) had caused a long-running dispute with the housing association which had lead to Hindi threatening to shoot any trespassers

The association said the driveway and this fence did not confirm to regulations in one of Kentucky's most exclusive communities and had threatened to take Hindi to court

In the letter, Hindi cites the Quran, the theory of creationism, the idea that America has gone to Communism and accused neighbors of stealing his 'no trespassing signs' in the dispute over the fence.

Hindi, who one prosecutor labelled 'the epitome of danger to the community', also wrote that he tried to make peace with the neighbors, but became frustrated.

In a videotaped interview with police, Hindi said he went to the meeting hoping to resolve the issues with Merritt and Fisher.

'I was hoping that I could reason with them,' Hindi told police. 'But I said to myself, if they are not going to resolve peace(fully) with me, honestly, I had to kill them. So I took my gun.'

There were around 20 people in the Springdale Community Church when Hindi opened fire, including a bible group, but only two members of the housing association were shot

A July 2014 trial date had been set for Hindi, who could have faced the death penalty. He also faced seven charges of wanton endangerment.

Hindi continued his erratic behaviour while in jail. He was hospitalized in March after a fight with officers.

On New Year's Day he was accused of throwing water on an officer and threatening to kill him, leading to two more charges against him.
