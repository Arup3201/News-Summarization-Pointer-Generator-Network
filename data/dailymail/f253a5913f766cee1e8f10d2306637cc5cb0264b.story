It has been a horrible season for Manchester United and not much better for record signing Juan Mata.

The diminutive Spanish playmaker went from Champions League winner and back-to-back player of the year awards at Chelsea to losing his place in the team and being sold to a United side spiralling down the league.

It is no surprise, then, that Mata has one eye on next season when he believes his new club, without the demands of European football to distract them, will be well placed to make an immediate return to the top of the pile. For both club and player, he believes, it will be a case of ‘what doesn’t kill you makes you stronger’.

‘I went through a situation at Chelsea
 that I had not been through before in my career,’ he says. ‘I was not 
playing regularly but I really believe that made me stronger. You can 
lose faith in yourself in adversity but I never did. I remained 
confident and I never lost sight of my objectives.’

He
 believes United can emulate Liverpool who, unfettered by European 
football, have lit up this season with their energetic football.

‘It
 can definitely be an advantage in the league. Of course, I would rather
 be playing in the Champions League, but if we take Liverpool as the 
example — you have a team who have fought all the way to the finish 
without having played in the Champions League.’

Mata
 already has his own Champions League winner’s medal, having planted a 
corner on Didier Drobga’s head for the Chelsea equaliser in that 
dramatic final in Munich. What he can’t be sure about is who will lead 
the club’s charge next season to get back into the competition.

There
 is an obvious bond with Ryan Giggs, whom he worshipped as a boy. The 
old saying that you should never meet your idols clearly does not apply 
in this case. ‘I told him when I arrived that he had been my hero 
growing up. And he said to me, “I’m really happy you’re here. But I’m a 
bit sad too because now I’ve only got the second best left foot at the 
club.”

‘I told him that was 
impossible. He was the player I watched most closely as a kid. I loved 
the way he controlled the ball and the touch he had. He was a pure 
winger, left-footed, right out on the touchline. He was fast, 
unplayable in a one-on-one situation, and he scored goals. Now destiny 
has made him my team-mate and my manager.’

Mata
 knows Giggs’ reign might not last and is guarded about what the future 
might hold. Asked about Louis van Gaal, he says: ‘I’ve never met him. I 
know what kind of history he has, the titles he has won and the kind of 
football he is playing with Holland. But I don’t think it’s good to talk
 about a coach who is not our manager.’

If
 the Dutchman does replace the Welshman, he will become Mata’s seventh 
coach in three seasons. So much for English patience and trigger-happy 
Spanish club presidents. ‘You mean it’s my fault,’ he laughs.

How
 do the managers compare? ‘ (Andre) Villas-Boas was the person who brought me to
 England and who trusted in me. He’s young, he has ambition and he wants
 to play attractive, fun and winning football. I will always be grateful
 to him.

‘Di Matteo was a 
bit like Giggs. He was the ex-player, the assistant coach, who stayed 
when Villas-Boas left. And he was a huge success. We won the Champions 
League, the FA Cup ... he was fantastic with me and with the whole 
group. He got us all together, all committed.

‘Then
 we won the Europa League (with Rafa Benitez). It was hard for him at 
first because of the history he had but I think he did things well. He 
was professional and he won a title — a title that the club hadn’t won 
before.’

Then came Jose 
Mourinho. Why did it not work out? A lack of communication seems key, 
although perhaps it was a symptom and not the cause of the problem.

Did
 he ask Mourinho why he was left out the side? ‘No. I didn’t consider it
 opportune.’ Did Mourinho ever explain to Mata why he didn’t fit? ‘No. 
Nothing,’ he says. When the talking did begin it was between Chelsea and
 United and it culminated in a helicopter flying him to Carrington on 
January 25 this year.

Season to remember: Luis Suarez and Liverpool have had an excellent season domestically

‘I 
will always be grateful to Chelsea,’ he says. ‘To the directors, the 
owner and the fans, because from the first day to the last they were 
fantastic.

No communication: Jose Mourinho did not explain to Mata why he was out of the side

‘I wish them the 
best, I really do. I have a lot of friends there. Cesar (Azpilicueta), 
Fernando (Torres), David (Luiz), Oscar. I talk to Lampard and Terry a 
lot too. I was with them for two and a half years and I wish them the 
best.’

He is proud of the 
open thank you letter he wrote Chelsea fans when he left. ‘I didn’t do 
that just for the sake of my image, it was heartfelt. I wanted to 
express what I felt about Chelsea, about the fans, who had always 
treated me so well.’

Such a 
public display of affection towards rival supporters might have 
compromised Mata’s relationship with United fans but most see it as a 
measure of the man. He is anxious to start wining trophies in a red 
shirt and he says the critics should stop getting so hung up on which 
position he plays.

‘Obviously,
 I don’t consider myself an out-an-out right-winger as such, but it 
offers me the chance to come inside on my left foot, and that way I have
 a broader field of vision. I have also played on the left with Valencia
 and with the national team and I liked it there. The position that I 
have played best in is behind the striker. But I think I can play in the
 other two as well.’

Mata won international youth honours for Spain with goalkeeper David de Gea and he believes United’s player of the year has the mentality to become an Old Trafford great.

‘He has huge
 faith in himself, which is a really important virtue,’ Mata says. ‘He 
doesn’t let anything affect him. He knows if he has made a mistake but 
it never sinks him. He uses it to make sure that he doesn’t make the 
same mistake next time. He’s very calm.

Sign of the times: A Chelsea fan holds up a banner praising Mata following his departure to United

‘I’ve
 spoken to friends about this and they say about Leo Messi: “It’s as if 
he doesn’t care about anything.” He scores goals and acts as if it’s 
normal. But maybe that’s a good thing. There’s so much pressure and 
maybe, if you tell yourself that you have to be brilliant all the time, 
when you make a mistake you collapse. Maybe you have to treat it all a 
bit more ‘normally’. I think that’s a quality great players have.’

So
 can De Gea and Mata win together in the red of United as they have in 
the red of Spain? ‘There has been a loss of confidence. Thirteen months 
ago, you’d be losing 3-0 and you’d win 4-3 at Old Trafford,’ says Mata. 
‘Now you’re losing 3-0 and it seems impossible. That mentality, that 
confidence, has not always been there this season. But I think the 
players and the club still have that attitude. The fans do, too. 

‘I
 remember, with Chelsea, it was almost impossible to win here. There are
 huge demands at this club. If you don’t win the league one year, you 
must win it the next year. Next season we have to demonstrate that the 
club has not lost its essence; has not lost its mentality; has not lost 
its competitiveness; and it has not lost its identity.’
