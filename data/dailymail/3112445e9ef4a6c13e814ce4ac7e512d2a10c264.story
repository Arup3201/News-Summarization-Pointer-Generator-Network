Leicester have bid a potential club record £6million for Brighton striker Leonardo Ulloa but the Championship side want £10million.

Nigel Pearson has pushed his board to bid on three previous occasions with the latest offer structured to be paid almost in one lump sum.

The 27-year-old Argentine moved to Brighton in January 2013 from Spanish side Almeria for £2m and has scored 26 goals in 58 appearances.
