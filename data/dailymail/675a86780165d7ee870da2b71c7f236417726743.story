The Coalition government ordered state primary schools to introduced the new assessment which focuses on a phonic system

The new reading test for six-year-olds which was taken by 600,000 pupils last year will have little or no impact on literacy, teachers have said. 

The Coalition government ordered state primary schools to introduce the new assessment which focuses on a phonic system. 

Children are asked to 'decode' a list of 40 words but the list includes made up words like 'voo' 'blim' and 'spron'. 

However, a review published by the Department of Education which is based on interviews with 940 teachers and 844 literacy coordinators criticised the test. 

The report, which has been published online, reads: 'Only a quarter of literacy coordinators expressed the view that the check provided useful information for teachers. 

'Most of the teachers interviewed as part of the case-study visits to schools reported that the check would have minimal if any, impact on the standard of reading and writing in their school in the future. 

'This view appeared to stem from the fact that many thought the outcomes from the check told them nothing new'.

While teachers were positive about teaching phonics, they believed a range of teaching methods should be used.

A Department of Health spokesman told The Daily Telegraph: 'The phonics check ensures children struggling with reading get the help they desperately need.

'Last year's check, when teachers identified more than 235,000 six-year-olds behind on reading - demonstrated that.' 

At their recent conference, members of the National Union of Teachers, backed plans to boycott phonics check next year.
