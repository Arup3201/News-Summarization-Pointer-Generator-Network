A drunk man who admitted to being high on amphetamines, climbed up a cherrypicker to look into a young woman's bedroom window before performing an indecent act.

Heath Christmann from Southport in the Gold Coast, faced the Southport Magistrates Court on Friday where he was charged with one count of performing an indecent act.

The 26-year-old had been drinking at a local pub on Thursday night before he came upon a block of flats at 11.10pm, the court heard.

He then scaled a cherrypicker that had been parked nearby, and sat in the basket, the Gold Coast Bulletin reported.

Christmann could see directly into the bedroom of an 18-year-old woman who had been trying to get to bed when she noticed him performing an indecent act.

The woman attempted to hide from Christmann by turning her bedroom lights off, however she told police he then began to use his lighter in a bid to see her better.

The 26-year-old scaled a small cherrypicker to look through the second story window of a woman's apartment before performing an indecent act 

She then called the police who arrested the wheel repairer shortly afterwards.

Christmann was granted bail despite the police prosecutor, Ben Fotheringham, objecting, claiming the woman 'expressed fears to the police that he may return again,' the Gold Coast Bulletin reported.

The 26-year-old must report to police three times a week and follow a strict curfew as part of his bail conditions.

He will reappear in court on September 29 and could face a jail sentence.
