The husband of an Iraqi-American woman who was found bludgeoned to death with a threatening note lying beside her yesterday made an emotional appeal for justice.

Shaima Alawadi, 32, was taken off life support on Saturday, three days after she was attacked with a tyre iron at her home in El Cajon, California.

Kassim Alhimidi, the mother-of-five's husband, last night made a plea direct to her killer.

Attack: Mrs Alawadi (left) was found close to death by her 17-year-old daughter Fatima Al Himidi (right) at the family home in El Cajon, California, last Wednesday

Speaking in Arabic as his 15-year-old son Mohammed translated, Mr Alhimidi said: 'The main question we would like to ask is what are you getting out of this and why did you do it?'

He urged anyone with information to contact police and thanked the Iraqi government for flying his wife's body to Iraq.

He was addressing reporters at a mosque east of San Diego after a memorial service for Mrs Alawadi.

She was found unconscious by her teenage daughter in the dining room of the family home in El Cajon, one of the nation's largest enclaves of Iraqi immigrants.

Fatima Al Himidi,Â  17, told a television station that the note said: 'Go back to your country, you terrorist.'

It is believed the attack took place after the father took the family's younger children to school.

El Cajon police have declined to confirm the contents of the note but said it has led investigators to regard the killing as a possible hate crime.

Final journey: Family and friends escort Mrs Alawadi's body to a waiting hearse following the memorial service in 2012

Chief James Redman said there was other evidence and called the killing an isolated incident.

Police said the family had found a similar note earlier this month but did not report it to authorities.

But Salam Al-Marayati, president of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, said it would be irresponsible to jump to conclusions.

He
 spoke with reporters at the mosque after meeting with the police chief 
and getting assurances from the FBI and the Department of Homeland 
Security that they were committed to solving the crime.

Mr
 Al-Marayati said: 'We don't know the facts of this case. We don't know 
if it's a hate crime. We don't know if it's not a hate crime.'

He urged the public to grieve for a family that fled persecution in Iraq and found tragedy in the U.S.

The
 victim and her family left Iraq in the early 1990s after a failed 
Shiite uprising, living in Saudi Arabian refugee camps before coming to 
the U.S. Saddam Hussain's troops hanged Mrs Alawadi's uncle.

The family arrived in the Detroit, Michigan, area in 1993 and moved to San Diego only recently.

Mrs Alawadi was a religious Shiite Muslim who wore a hijab; her father Sayed Nabeel Alawadi is a cleric in Iraq.

The victim's body was taken to San Diego airport yesterday and is now headed for Najaf in Iraq.

The FBI, which is assisting El Cajon police in the investigation, defines a hate crime as an offence motivated by a bias against race, religion, ethnicity, disability or sexual orientation.

There were 1,409 hate crimes nationwide based on religion during 2010, including 186 targeting Muslims.

There were 1,040 based on ethnicity or national origin, including 359 targeting groups other than Hispanics.
