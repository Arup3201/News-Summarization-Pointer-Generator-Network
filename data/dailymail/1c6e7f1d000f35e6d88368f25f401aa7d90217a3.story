Theresa May's claims about the effects of immigration have been called into question

Theresa May’s claims about the effects of immigration have been called into question by secret government research, it was reported last night.

David Cameron is said to have prevented the publication of an internal report, completed in November, which suggests that the impact of migration on British jobs is 'virtually nil'.

The BBC’s Newsnight programme claimed it had not been published because the effect of immigration on unemployment was much smaller than Mrs May has previously claimed.

The Home Secretary has in the past cited research by the Migration Advisory Committee, a group of independent academics, as a basis for saying that ‘for every additional 100 immigrants... 23 British workers would not be employed’.

But the new analysis by civil servants is understood to show that the impact of so-called ‘displacement’ is much less stark.

Internal emails seen by Newsnight showed that one civil servant described the MAC research used by Mrs May was ‘not robust enough given the wider evidence’.

One civil servant said in an email that the study should be published - something Mr Cameron has so far refused to do.

‘It would be difficult to keep the report solely for internal use,’ he wrote.

Critics say Mr Cameron has blocked the report’s publication because it shows the Home Secretary’s claims to be hollow.

But others say it is unsurprising that the displacement rate is now lower than it was in 2012, because last year 87 per cent of new jobs went to British people.

The Conservatives were embarrassed last week when figures showed that its pledge to reduce net migration to below 100,000 people a year by 2015 was unlikely to be met.

Last night Liberal Democrat MP Julian Huppert said: ‘It’s obvious that this report should be published as quickly as possible.

Critics say Mr Cameron has blocked the report's publication because the Home Secretary's claims are hollow

‘The best available data shows we benefit very substantially from immigration. The real question is why David Cameron is trying to block this.

‘We have to have the right figures to make the right decisions.’

Tory MP Stephen Barclay said: ‘The data is evolving. It’s basically not true that the impact is minimal. There has been a very heavy localised impact.’

A government spokesman said: ‘Reducing immigration so our economy delivers for people who want to work hard and play by the rules is part of our long-term economic plan. We don’t comment on internal government documents.’ 

Labour, the Lib Dems and Ukip were united in calling for the report to be published.

Last night Labour’s immigration spokesman David Hanson said: ‘David Cameron and Theresa May now need to publish this report today.

‘The British people should have information made available to them so they can make a judgement about the impact of immigration on jobs. This should be done on the basis of fact not more empty rhetoric or spin from the Government.

‘The Government’s record on immigration is one of failing to meet their own net migration target and ramping up the rhetoric. Now they want to keep their own research hidden rather than scrutinised.

‘We need an open, calm and fact based debate on the impact of immigration and this should be facilitated by the Government and not made harder.’

Labour's shadow immigration minister David Hanson said the public needed facts not empty rhetoric or spin from the government while  Ukip leader Nigel Farage said there was 'no doubt' Brits had lost work as a result of an influx of labour from overseas

UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage told BBC Radio 4's Today: 'I think there is no doubt that British people have lost their jobs because there is too much labour coming into the market.

'The other factor, which is not in this report but is perhaps even more pertinent, is the effect on wages of people in work.

'We have had wage compression and it has meant lower wages for millions and millions of people.'

Liberal Democrat MP Martin Horwood also joined calls for a swift publication: 'Let's put it kindly: it's got stuck in someone's in-tray waiting for the final sign-off, hasn't it?

'It would be very, very helpful if it was now extracted from that in-tray and published.

'It sounds as though this is a very rigorous study ... a very important contribution to the factual debate on immigration which is sorely needed.'
