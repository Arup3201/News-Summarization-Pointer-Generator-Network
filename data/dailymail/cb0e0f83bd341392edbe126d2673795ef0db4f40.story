As the centrepiece of the Diamond Jubilee river pageant last year, it was last seen decked in gilded finery and bearing a proud monarch.

Now the Spirit of Chartwell, which served as the Queen’s royal barge, is sailing under a foreign flag - having been sold to a Portuguese holiday company as a luxury charter cruiseboat.

The 64-metre vessel will start its new life as a pleasure cruiser on the Douro river in Porto next month.

Stripped of its banners, thrones and British ensign, its prosaic exterior is barely recognisable from the sumptuous vessel that led a 1,000 boat flotilla down the Thames last June.

Luxury cruiseboat: The Spirit of Chartwell, flagship of the Queen's jubilee river pageant last summer, is now operating as a cruise liner out of Porto

Thrones: A pair of red velvet chairs, bought from Harrods, are one of the new additions inside the barge, which sit beneath a reproduction portrait of Her Majesty

Unrecognisable: Stripped of its banners, thrones and British ensign, the exterior looks very different from the vessel that starred in the Diamond Jubilee last year

Modifications: The new owner has replaced the original gilded prow with a pair of nubile mermaids modelled on his wife

In place of the original gilded prow – which featured tasteful dolphins and the Royal cipher - the new owner has mounted a pair of nubile mermaids modelled on his wife, topped with a fake crown.

In June’s pageant, the boat was garlanded out with flowers gathered from the Queen’s gardens. Now it has to make do with plastic imitation blooms strung along its upper railings.

However, the Spirit of Chartwell remains virtually untouched on the inside since it was given a six-month, £1million royal makeover in preparation for the Jubilee celebrations.

Holidaymakers who stump up the £2,121 cost of a seven night cruise can recline on solid mahogany furniture, listen to a baby grand piano and sample drinks at the cocktail bar.

The boat will take them up the Douro river, stopping at vineyards and villages, until it reaches Salamanca in neighbouring Spain.

Some of the interior fittings are surprisingly modern for a vessel designed to recreate the splendour of 17th century royal barges.

The capacious main salon is fitted with neon light fittings designed to change colour from icy blue to warm pink at the flick of a switch.

Dinner guests are seated on banks of red leather sofas and upright Pullman chairs while the walls feature glowing glass panels – designed by French designer Rene Lalique – depicting sensuous nudes.

One of the few new additions – a pair of red velvet ‘thrones’ bought from Harrods – sit beneath a reproduction portrait of Her Majesty.

The Spirit of Chartwell’s 15 en-suite cabins fit 30 guests. They include all the comforts expected of a four star hotel – including 32inch flat screen televisions and ensuite bathrooms – but hardly rival the opulence of Buckingham Palace.

Starring role: The boat played a major part in the Queen's Diamond Jubilee last year

Attraction: The boat's new owner expected the Spirit of Chartwell's royal credentials to be a magnet for British tourists

Leisure: Holidaymakers on the barge will also be able to enjoy drinks from the cocktail bar

The boat was bought in September from its British owner, Phillip Morrell, by Portuguese millionaire Mario Ferreira, the CEO of charter company DouroAzul.

The tycoon, who boasts he is a friend of Richard Branson, said he acquired the boat for a ‘bargain’, but said a clause in the sale contract prevented him from disclosing the price.

Mr Morrell had spent £8million renovating the boat, but was reluctantly forced to sell it after the Port of London prevented him from using it from cruise trips on the Thames over concerns it was too large to fit under a bridge in Richmond, Surrey.

Mr Ferreira naturally expected the Spirit of Chartwell’s impeccable royal credentials to be a magnet for British tourists, and hired 14 English-speaking crew members to cater for their every whim.

Comfortable: The barge's 15 en-suite cabins fit 30 guests and all include the comforts expected of a four star hotel

Bookings: Owner Mr Ferreira has been surprised to find most of the bookings so far have come from Germany. Pictured left is a cabin in the boat and right is the dining room

But he revealed most of the bookings to date have come from Germany, saying: ‘It is kind of weird. I was totally convinced the British would be the first ones to buy trips on it.

‘But the Germans have booked out the majority of the year. They must be very curious. I hope it will be as popular with British people in the future.’

He added: ‘It is a fantastic vessel. It is completely sound as it was fully checked out by the Royal Navy before the Jubilee.

‘Plus, it has some special security features. For example, there is a high-tech fire extinction system that uses high-pressure vapourised water to put out fires without causing damage.

‘It has amazing medical kits, with everything you could possibly need. I’m not sure if the windows are bullet proof. I never asked, and I don’t really want to test them.’

New gilded prow

The original structure featured a sculpture of Old Father Thames, a pair of classical dolphins - symbols of the Thames - and the royal cipher.

In its place, Mr Ferreira has placed a pair of topless mermaids - which he says are based on his wife Paula - topped by an imitation crown.

Plastic flowers

For June’s Thames pageant, the Spirit of Chartwell was garlanded with flowers from the Queen’s gardens.

Its new owner has made do with strings of imitation flowers. Although they may be less impressive, they will stand up to the heat of a Portuguese summer.

Portuguese ensign

When it served as the royal barge, the Spirit of Chartwell was given a special permit to wear the British White Ensign, usually reserved for Royal Navy ships, as well as the Royal Standard.

Its new owner said he wanted to keep a British ensign as it ‘looks more authentic’. But he was prevented by red tape imposed UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency.

He said: ‘They drove me totally insane. I wanted to keep the British ensign, but they said they had to come and certify not only my ship, but also the captain.

Velvet ‘thrones’

Mr Ferreira imported the red velvet chairs from Harrods store in Knightsbridge. They were created as part of limited edition range of Jubilee furniture by designer Clive Christian, also known as the creator of the world’s most expensive perfume.

At first glance, the chairs seem authentically regal.

But closer investigation reveals the heraldic crest and motto embroidered on the seat backs - ‘fax animi honestae gloria’, meaning ‘through honour, glory is found’ - belong to Mr Christian’s family and not to the royals.
