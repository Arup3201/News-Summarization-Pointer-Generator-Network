Twitter users normally gauge how their tweets are doing by seeing how many retweets, favourites and replies they've got to a particular post.

But now with a new analytics tool they can see how their followers are engaging with their tweets in terms of popularity and views.

And the tool can also break down a user's followers, showing where they are from, what interests they share and more.  

Twitter has rolled out an analytics tool (shown) for all of its users. The tool had previously been available only to advertisers. It lets Twitter users see how many views their tweets have hadIt also gives a breakdown of followers including gender, locations and more

People who use Facebook and Twitter are less likely than others to share their opinions on hot-button issues, even when they are offline.

That's according to a survey that challenges the view of social media as a vehicle for debate.

The study suggests that sites like Facebook and Twitter might actually encourage self-censorship.

The study was carried out by Pew Research Centre in Washington DC in conjunction with Rutgers University in New Jersey.

Researchers said they detected what they call the 'spiral of silence' phenomenon: Unless people know their audience agrees, they are likely to shy away from discussing anything controversial.

In other words, most people are more comfortable with ice-bucket challenges than political banter. 

The tool was originally built for advertisers in June but now Twitter has opened its analytics dashboard to anyone, reports Mashable.

People can use the tool kit at analytics.twitter.com to hone their impact on the social network.

It lets them see how many times a tweet was seen by people, as well as how many times it was favourited and retweeted.

The dashboard also reveals how many times people have clicked on the profile, and when and how users engaged with specific tweets.

Clicking on a tweet will give its individual statistics. 

In addition the site gives a breakdown of a user's followers, revealing their gender, location, shared interests and more.  

All the information is laid out in graphs and lists - such as the top 10 Twitter accounts that a user's followers also follow.

To use the tools, Twitter users must have had an account for at least two weeks and it can’t have been deleted, restricted or suspended. 

Any tweets must also have been written in English, French, Spanish or Japanese.
