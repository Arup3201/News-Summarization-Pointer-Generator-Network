Those hoping to live out their 90s fantasies and become a modern-day Fresh Prince of Bel Air can now do just that in this stunning mansion - as long as they've got $22million to spare.

The 32-room house is certainly not to be sniffed at, with 10 bedrooms and 12 bathrooms - not to mention a waterslide which takes you from inside the house straight into one of the two pools.

But that's not all you get for the eye-watering asking price - which equates to £14,212,800.

Eye-watering: Those with a spare $22million can purchase this two-storey, 32-room home

Lavish: The mansion was built in 2009, and has enough gold leaf and chandeliers to put Versailles to shame

Opulent: Guests can be entertained in splendor in one of the many rooms of the home

Water feature: This slide begins indoors - so the new owner can get to the pool without going outside first

Indeed, this glamorous mansion actually puts the one featured in hit comedy The Fresh Prince to shame.

For a start, that house only has five bedrooms and just one pool and is only worth an estimated $8,391,854.

What's more, it isn't even in Bel Air, but in the similarly affluent neighboring Brentwood - once home to the likes of Anna Nicole Smith and Arnold Schwarzenegger.

In contrast, Bel Air was once the home of Elizabeth Taylor. 

Built just six years ago in 2009, the mansion's décor echoes the Palace of Versailles with huge chandeliers, mirrors and gold leaf from ceiling to floor.

What's more, just like the Banks family home in the 90s sitcom, the house is covered in marble and has its own gym.

And for those who don't fancy climbing the sweeping staircase to the home's second floor to one of the four main bedrooms, there is a lift. 

Tired: The sweeping staircase leads to the four main bedrooms in the house - although there is a lift as well

Choices: There are two 'lagoon-style' pools to chose from in this 6,767 square metre property

Top of the range: The kitchen - which is suitably sumptuous - is fitted out with Meile appliances

Space: The new owner will be able to relax in style with rooms looking out over the garden

Stunning: The house also boasts views out across the exapnse of Los Angeles

Secluded: The home is behind electric gates, which means the owner can relax easily

Each of the four main bedrooms comes with its own individually designed bathroom, while the kitchen is filled with top-of-the-range Miele appliances.

It also boasts a 'grotto-style' spa and a racquetball court, and a five bedroom pool house so guests can enjoy their own taste of luxury in the comfort of their own space.

However, it does have one definite downside: the listing bizarrely boasts that it also comes with a 'mother-in-law'. 

Exclusive: The house is in one of Los Angeles' most expensive areas  - an area once home to Elizabeth Taylor

Platial: The architect and designer have used gold leaf and copious amounts of marble throughout

Empty: The mansion's wine cellar is ready and waiting to be filled with the finest vintages

Room: The pool house alone boasts five bedrooms - which means there is plenty of space for guests

Exercise: If the pools and racquet courts are not to your fancy, you can try out the home's private gym

Individual: Each of the four bedrooms gets its own uniquely designed bathroom, like this one

A spokesperson for LuxuryEstate.com, which is selling the property, said: 'This house is fit for royalty. The master suite boasts large closets, a spa-styled tub and gorgeous views of the backyard.

'It's ideal for large scale entertaining and has panoramic city to ocean views as well as manicured lawns.

'The house provides an unmatched feeling of luxury and perfection.'

Spa: The house also has its own 'grotto-style' spa, for those who grow bored of the two other pools
