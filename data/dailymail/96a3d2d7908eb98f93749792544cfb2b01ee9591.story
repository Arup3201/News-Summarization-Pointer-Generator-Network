The dreaded magpie swooping season is apon us, as the weather starts to warm up.

Whether on a bike going for a ride, or walking your dog, magpies are looking for their next victim to attack, becoming increasingly aggressive during breeding season which lasts until October.

But what are the best ways to  stop magpies from swooping? Breakfast announcer from Star FM Mildura's 99.5, Amber Wheatland tested out two theories and documented them on youtube, and it's definite to say one worked while the other miserably failed.

The fake eyes clearly don't work : Amber's test two fails as a magpie angrily swoops her

AHHHHH! Panic sets in as Amber realises the magpie is coming straight for her

Magpies are known to start swooping in breeding season from August until late October. They become aggressive protecting their nest

For both test runs, Amber decided to get on her bike and ride down a magpie prone road, where she was knew she would encounter some fierce feathered behaviour.

For test one it was the branches stuck in a helmet, strategy.

A pretty scared Amber and wasn't sure if this would work, but was keen to try, and when she did was pleasantly surprised with the result.

The angry bird flew down very close to Amber but it appears not to swoop and feeling very relieved she comes out of her test run relatively unscathed.

But test two, fake eyes on the back of the head trick, didn't go so smoothly.

'See the eyes. It's quite a fierce magpie.' she said.

'From all reports it's not very nice so hopefully the eyes are going to work, I do have a helmet on so shouldn't hurt too much.'

But she was so wrong! the magpie swooped and went on the attack, it hit her helmet causing Amber to start to panic.

Test two : what Amber doesn't know is that this magpie will go straight for her, failing miserably

Got you! The magpie goes straight for Amber's helmet. Magpies are more aggressive and swoop people in breeding season between August and late October

Rider and walkers beware! : We are in the middle of magpie swooping season which lasts between August and late October as the bird get overprotective of their nests

Test one : It has worked. The magpie has stayed at a distance

The branches on the head trick has worked and kept the magpie at a safe distance

'Ahhhhh, ahhhhhh, the eyes don't work, they eyes don't work,' she screamed.

'Ahhhh the eyes don't work. They don't work, they don't work. Get it off, get it off.'

The attack lasted for more than thirty seconds and Amber was frantic.

'Is it gone, is it gone, it's not gone. Get it off, ahhhhhh, get mum, get mum, oh my god is it gone,' 

There was no doubt her magpie swooping theories had a clear result and her findings, one worked and one definitely did not work.

The youtube clip also wrote, 'In case you missed Amber's results , The eyes don't work, the eyes don't work, the eyes don't work, the eyes don't work. Get mum, get mum, the eyes don't work'.

Amber who claims she loves animals and always wanted to be a vet, documented the magpie theories for her breakfast show on Amber and Billo's Star FM weekdays program.

A small percentage of magpies become highly aggressive during breeding season from late August to early October, and will swoop and sometimes attack passersby. 

Mostly male birds are generally known to attack pedestrians at around 50 m  from their nest, and cyclists at around 100 m.

Attacks begin as the eggs hatch, increase in frequency and severity as the chicks grow, and tail off as the chicks leave the nest.

Watch out : Magpies are on the lookout for vulnerable walkers and bike riders, with swooping season in full swing
