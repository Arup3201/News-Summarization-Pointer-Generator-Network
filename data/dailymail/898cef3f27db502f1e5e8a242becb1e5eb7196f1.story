Australians will be paying back more student debt and working less from 2016 as the Federal Government forecasts a dire future for the nation's graduates.

Up to 65,000 students, or 30 per cent of graduates, will be jobless four months after finishing their studies, and those who find employment will be earning substantially less. The Treasury Department  has also revealed 17,000 more graduates than predicted last year will be unemployed in the four month period.

And while the rate of unemployed graduates will soar, the salaries for those starting a new job will drop. According to Treasury, the average graduate income will fall from 78 per cent this year to 74 per cent in 2016-17.

More Australian graduates will be unemployed in the first four months of leaving university in 2016

The dire analysis reflects other independent research into graduate job numbers. A Graduate Destination survey showed the rate of graduates in full-time employment fell from 76 per cent in 2012 to 71 per cent last year.

The figures also reflect the announcements made in the May budget, and the impact of the Federal Government's education policies that sparked rioting and fiery public protests in capital cities. Many were angry over the Federal Government's decision to deregulate university fees estimated to save it $1.1 billion over the next three years.

Experts predict the changes to higher education could force the cost of degrees to increase to more than $120,000, and as a result, deter people from furthering their studies at university.

Christopher Pyne said Australians who graduate will still be earning more than those without a degree

But more deregulation means more borrowing, Tim Higgins from the the Australian National University said. He believes deregulation raises concerns about future budget blowouts as students load up on debt. 'There are no incentives for universities to manage the risk of loan non-payment because the government pays the shortfall,'' Dr Higgins said.

The Sydney Morning Herald reported that loan payments are expected to increase from $6.6 billion this year to $12 billion in 2018, meaning debt will increase by $3 billion a year between 2016-2018.

Greens higher education spokeswoman Lee Rhiannon said it's hard to believe the government would introduce such radical changes, knowing the dire outcomes it will have on graduates.

She said: 'It beggars belief the government would introduce these changes when their own department's figures show fewer graduates will be employed.'

But Education Minister Christopher Pyne has justified fee deregulation by pointing out there will still be benefits to having a degree. He said graduates will be earning about 75 per cent more than non-graduates - or about $1 million more over their lifetimes.
