A 79-year-old man may have mistaken his accelerator for the break and caused mayhem when his car plunged onto train tracks and needed to be lifted off by crane on Sunday morning.

The mishap caused delays for commuters between Sydney and Newcastle on the Central Coast and Newcastle line, when the man's red Toyota Camry went through a fence at Wyong Station on the Central Coast, north of Sydney, just before 10am.

Police confirmed the man may have made the mistake of pushing his accelerator instead of breaking, reported The Daily Telegraph.

Missing the station buildings, the car passed over the platform and landed on the train tracks, between platforms two and three.

The red Toyota Camry landed between platforms two and three, but did not hit any of the station building before plunging

Despite being shaken by the accident, the elderly man was not injured

Luckily, the car did not hit anyone on the platform at the time and despite being shaken by the accident, the man was not injured.

Police and rescue teams attended the scene and scrambled to work out a solution for removing the car from the tracks as quickly and safely as possible.

It took several hours for crews to get the car off the tracks and a Transport for NSW spokesman said all trains were diverted onto another line and only one of the station's platforms could be used while the vehicle was being removed.

At about 11.30 a crane was brought to the station to move the car and this required the removal of overhead wires, which meant engineers needed to shut power to the tracks while the car was being moved.

Despite the nature of the accident, the spokesman said it caused 'minimal disruption' until about 11.30am when the crane arrived.

'They took down the wire and so there were no trains for about an hour,' the spokesman said. 'Fortunately, being a Sunday, it wasnâ€™t as busy as it might have been.'
