Financial setbacks: Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky left an estate worth nothing in the UK

Russian oligarch Boris Berezovsky left an estate worth nothing in the UK after he was found hanged in mysterious circumstances.

The former tycoon, an outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin, was once known as Russia’s second richest man, worth £1.9 billion.

He was found dead in March last year in a bathroom at his ex-wife’s £20 million home in Ascot, Berkshire, after a series of financial setbacks. 

His family do not believe he killed himself, and a coroner recorded an open verdict. 

Probate records reveal that he died without a will and left an estate valued at 'nil' in England and Wales.

It is not known if he had assets held overseas or in trust or joint-ownership which would not have been included in his estate.

His daughter Elizaveta Berezovskaya claimed at a two day inquest in Windsor last March that the Russian Government could have been behind his death.

A German forensic scientist, acting for his family, who examined autopsy photographs, said he did not believe Berezovsky had killed himself.

But police found no evidence of foul play and the inquest heard how he had spoken of suicide before his death. Another scientist also concluded he had not been murdered.

The Berkshire coroner Peter Bedford recorded an open verdict, but said there was 'compelling evidence' of suicide due to Berezovsky's depression and financial problems.

The former tycoon, also known as Platon Elenin, lost a London High Court battle with Roman Abramovich, the Chelsea football club owner, just seven months before his death.

He lost a £1.8billion damages claim over rightful ownership of the oil group Sibneft and was also left with an estimated £100million legal bill.
