Mrs Clinton has yet to comment on the row over her private email server

Hillary Clinton arranged for a ‘homebrew’ email server to be set up whilst Secretary of State amid an atmosphere of ‘what Hillary wants, Hillary gets’.

A former senior IT official in the Department of State told Dailymail.com that Mrs Clinton was ‘demanding’ and that staff had to get things done without asking too many questions.

The existence of the server at her private home in Chappaqua, upstate New York, would have been known to just a close circle of friends as ‘these are things that are not discussed’, he said.

The former official also spoke of his frustration that Mrs Clinton’s actions had deprived the public of vital historical records.

He said: ‘I don’t agree with it. This is history that you are throwing away here’.

Mrs Clinton, who is expected to run for President in 2016, has yet to comment on the row over her private email server, which she set up in 2009 when she came to office.

Federal law requires all letters and emails written by government officials to be retained for Congressional committees, historians and so the media can access them.

However Mrs Clinton did not even have a government email address whilst serving as America’s top diplomat for four years until 2013.

Mrs Clinton’s actions mean it will be harder to obtain copies of the emails through Freedom of Information laws - and could have been a breach of federal law.

The former official said he did not know at the time what Mrs Clinton was doing but said that he was ‘not surprised’ when it became public knowledge.

He said that under her watch the mantra was: ‘This is what the Secretary wants, this is what the secretary gets.’

He said: ‘If you’ve ever met a Secretary of State they are demanding...that’s the reason they head the Department of State. Hillary was no different’.

The former official said that the rules from the National Archives are ‘antiquated’ and say that it falls on the individual to save their emails for archiving purposes.

There is little oversight meaning that Mrs Clinton would have effectively been able to decide herself how she would be presented in the history books, which the official said was wrong.

He said: ‘Once you get into the senior levels of government, anything we talk about is going to be of historical merit, even if it might be minor now.

‘Twenty years from now it could be a major thing’.

The row over the server is acutely embarrassing for Mrs Clinton and has stoked fears among Democrats that she might make the kind of missteps in 2016 that she did when she lost to Barack Obama in 2008.

Republicans have said that, aside from the potential breach of security, what she did was ethically wrong.

Mrs Clinton has so far not described her motivation for using a private email account - hdr22@clintonemail.com - which traced back to her own private email server registered under an apparent pseudonym, Eric Hoteham.

According to the Associated Press, that name does not appear in public records databases, campaign contribution records or Internet background searches.

Eric Hoteham was listed as the customer at Clinton's $1.7 million home on Old House Lane in Chappaqua in records registering the Internet address for her email server since August 2010.

The Hoteham personality also is associated with a separate email server, presidentclinton.com, and a non-functioning website, wjcoffice.com, all linked to the same residential Internet account as Mrs. Clinton's email server.

The former president's full name is William Jefferson Clinton.

Jonathan Mayer, a PhD candidate in computer science & law lecturer at Stanford University, said that Mrs Clinton may have told her Internet service provider that she was starting a small business to allow her to set up the server.

He said that Internet companies like Time Warner are wary about allowing individuals to do so as they might be hackers looking to send spam.

Mr Mayer added that after carrying out his own tests it appears that Mrs Clinton’s server is still up and running, despite the ongoing row.

He told Dailymail.com that it ‘does appear that it’s the same server, though I cannot be sure’.

A Department of State spokeswoman has insisted that Mrs Clinton did not send any classified emails from her personal email account.

She has also said that Mrs Clinton has handed over 55,000 emails to the National Archives, though not only after they were vetted by her team.
