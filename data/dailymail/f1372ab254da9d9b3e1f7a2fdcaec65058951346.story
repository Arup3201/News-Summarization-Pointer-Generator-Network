Critical: Canadian freestyle skier Sarah Burke has been critically injured

World class Canadian freestyle skier Sarah Burke is in a coma after a stunt on a training run in Utah.

The 29-year-old was airlifted to the University of Utah hospital in Salt Lake City yesterday after she was injured during a halfpipe training run in Park City.

'Sarah sustained serious injuries and remains intubated and sedated in critical condition,' said Dr. Safdar Ansari, who is treating her.

The nature of her injuries has not yet been disclosed.

Witnesses said that the accident at the Park City Mountain resort, initially did not appear to be that serious.

'She landed a trick down in the bottom end of the pipe, and kind of bounced, from her feet to her head,' Peter Judge, the CEO of Canada's freestyle skiing program, told the Toronto Globe and Mail newspaper.

'It wasn't anything that looked like a catastrophic fall, so I'm a bit mystified.'

She was on the same halfpipe where snowboarder Kevin Pearce suffered traumatic brain injury after a near-fatal fall on December 31, 2009.

Burke's husband, freestyle skier Rory Bushfield, was with other family members at the hospital and wanted to express thanks for well wishes coming in from around the world.

Trailblazer: Burke is widely considered the foremost pioneer for her main sport of freestyle halfpipe

Mrs Burke's husband Rory Bushfield said he knows his wife will 'most certainly fight to recover'

'Sarah is a very strong young woman, and she will most certainly fight to recover,' Bushfield said in a statement.

Mrs Burke is widely considered the foremost pioneer for her main sport of freestyle halfpipe.Â 

Injured: Burke remains in a coma, a day after she was airlifted from the mountains of Utah to a Salt Lake City hospital with serious injuries

She lobbied aggressively to have it included in the Olympics, where it will debut in 2014.

"She not only gave the sport legitimacy but opened the door into a much broader spectrum," said Judge.

She is a four-time Winter X Games champion and had been scheduled to defend her 2011 title later this month in Aspen, Colo.
