You would typically expect a ghost's tipple of choice to be a spirit, but a haunted pub claims to have a phantom with a penchant for red wine.

Staff at the Carlisle Castle Hotel in Newtown, Sydney, have noticed a series of spooky happenings in recent weeks with many incidents even captured on camera.Â 

They have seen bottles and glasses smash to the ground despite no one standing anywhere near them. But it appears that only one type of alcohol is the focus of these spooky occurrences - $27 bottles of red wine.

Peter Bradbury, licensee of the Carlisle Castle Hotel, has set up a Facebook to document the activity.

He told the Inner West Courier: 'We have the cameras on when we're doing the tills and we've seen a few strange things.

'It's all very strange. I don't know how long it's been coming but it's become quite a regular in the last few weeks. There's been a few bottles of wine falling off the shelf.'

Mr Bradbury added that if a ghost is behind the events, they certainly have good taste, as only expensive red wines are targeted.

He said: 'Red wine seems to be the choice, apparently he likes the red. Expensive wine too, he picked a Kilikanoon last night, which is about $27 a bottle.'

A strange light, which in the footage appears to be shaped like a human, can be seen in front of the table

Other strange events include a beer tap apparently turning on by itself, lights flickering on and off, and strange shadows 'dancing' around the room.

Some patrons have offered up their own suggestions on Facebook as to who may be responsible.

One theory is that it could be 'Old Peter' - an elderly man who worked in the pub in the early 1990s.

Others are convinced the ghost is Mr Bradbury's predecessor, Johnny Hoy.

More cynical souls have suggested a vibrating fridge motor or poor shelf-stacking are to blame, pouring cold water on the 'Scooby Doo mystery' one drinker likened the situation to.

Mr Bradbury is yet to be convinced by any of the theories put forward however, saying he still has no idea what's behind the really behind the strange occurrences.

'When we saw the bottles and glasses just start flying off shelves, we saved it and put it up on our Facebook page for a bit of a laugh really but we don't know what it is,' he said.
