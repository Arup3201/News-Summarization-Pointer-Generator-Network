Barclays has been charged with ‘systematic fraud and deceit’ against its customers.

The alleged victims include large investment institutions that manage the pension savings of millions.

The bank is accused of duping investors who traded shares in its ‘dark pool’, a secretive market where people buy and sell stocks without disclosing information about the transactions, according to a US lawsuit.

Pension funds that traded in the ‘dark pool’ may have lost some of their members’ savings while operating in what they thought was a fair forum – but which was rigged against them.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who launched the lawsuit, said Barclays ‘demonstrated a disturbing disregard for its investors in a systematic pattern of fraud and deceit’.

If found guilty, Barclays faces the prospect of multi-million-pound fines, compensation and further lawsuits.

The bank is still rebuilding its reputation after a string of scandals including rigging of the Libor interest rate and mis-selling of PPI loan insurance.

Shares in Barclays slumped more than 6 per cent after the charges were revealed, slashing the value of the company by £2.3billion in a single day. According to the lawsuit, Barclays hoped to earn an extra £30million a year by expanding its dark pool.

To attract investors, it told them that they would be protected from ‘high-frequency traders’, who use super-fast computers to perform trades.

In fact, the lawsuit alleges, Barclays invited such traders into the dark pool. Some of these predators were Barclays’ own staff, who stood to make more money for themselves and the bank by exploiting other investors.

The bank was also accused of routing investors into its own dark pool rather than to those owned by rivals, where they might have got a better deal.

As a result, millions of savers may not have received the returns they might have reasonably expected from their pension fund. The bank’s behaviour amounted to a ‘pattern of fraud and deceit’, according to the charges.

Mr Schneiderman said: ‘Barclays grew its dark pool by telling investors they were diving into safe waters.’

He said Barclays’ dark pool was actually ‘full of predators – there at Barclays’ invitation’.

A bank spokesman said: ‘We take these allegations very seriously… The integrity of the markets is a top priority of Barclays.’
