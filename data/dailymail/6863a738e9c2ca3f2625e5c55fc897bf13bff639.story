The latest in virtual reality gaming, the Oculus Rift DK2 headset, certainly looks real - at least that's what the security guard's reaction in this video would lead one to believe.

Ugandan gaming community GamersNights were recently testing the new product and decided to show a local man exactly what the new wave of gaming is all about.

Playing a demo called Cyber Space, which imitates a large pendulum swing (like the ones found at a theme park), the man eagerly donned his goggles to take a spin on the 'ride.'

In Uganda, a security guard recently tried out the Oculus Rift DK2 headset - with hilarious results

The man was initially quite shocked at what he was seeing, but within seconds, his reaction changed to utter joy.

Fast forward several more seconds however, and on what would seemingly be the downswing motion of the pendulum ride, the security guard finds himself falling head-first onto the floor while grabbing the seat of his chair.

The audience and crew immediately burst into laughter, while the man was helped up and dusted off.

Thankfully, the guard got a chuckle out of his immersive experience embarrassment, as well.

Although initially the man was quite surprised by the game, his reaction quickly turned to enjoyment

However, at the part where the pendulum swings downward, the man suddenly fell face-first onto the floor

Oculus Rift is a virtual video game experience, which recently received a large $2 billion dollar investment from Facebook.

While demo versions have been making the rounds, a consumer version is still yet untested.

However, the virtual reality start-up is believed to have the potential to change the way we work, play, and communicate, according to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. 

The crew and audience immediately burst into laughter, as the security guard was clearly not injured

As the demonstrator helped him up and dusted him off, the tester too had a chuckle at his own expense
