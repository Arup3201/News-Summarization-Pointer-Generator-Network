A postman has been saved from a life dependent upon dialysis thanks to a colleague who gave him a new kidney.

Ian Shillcott, 48, suffers from polycystic kidney disease, which caused cysts to form and his kidneys to fail.

Doctors warned him that he would need kidney dialysis to clean his blood within months, unless a donor could be found to allow him to have a transplant.

All of his family members were tested, 
but none were suitable donors, so Mr Shillcott faced a race against time 
to find a compatible organ.

To his relief, his colleague, Charles Czajkowski, 44, offered to be tested - and was found to be a perfect match.

The pair underwent surgery earlier this month and grandfather-of-three, Mr Shillcott, is now returning to full health.

He said: ‘It is like winning the lottery because all of a sudden I have gone from falling asleep most days, to three weeks later I am absolutely buzzing.

‘It has been very emotional. Out of the blue at work one day Chalkie, as we call him, came up to me and said “by the way, I want to give you my kidney”.

‘I was floored, it was quite amazing really.’

Without a transplant, Mr Shillcott would have needed kidney dialysis to clean his blood because his kidney function had dropped to 24 per cent

Before he received the new kidney from Mr Czajkowski (right), Mr Shillcott (left) was so exhausted that he could only work part-time 

Speaking of his donation, Mr Czajkowski said: ‘It is the fact it makes such a difference to somebody else.

‘People lose track of that in their lives. Every now and again something comes along that allows you to make a difference.

‘Luckily, I got to do that for somebody else.’

The postmen have worked together at the Royal Mail depot in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, for eight years – Mr Czajkowski as a door-to-door postman and Mr Shillcott in customer services.

They also both own allotments and became good friends through gardening.

After leaving the army 16 years ago, Mr Shillcott was diagnosed with the genetic kidney condition.

It causes cysts – fluid-filled sacs – to develop in the kidneys which mean they gradually lose more and more of their function.

The two men underwent surgery at Southmead Hospital in Bristol on April 5

Symptoms include abdominal pain, blood in the urine and high blood pressure.

Eventually, it can cause kidney failure which causes symptoms including tiredness and shortness of breath.

If the condition is severe enough, the patient will need dialysis or a kidney transplant.

There is no treatment for polycystic kidney disease.

Last year Mr Shillcott’s kidney function dropped dramatically to 24 per cent meaning he was placed on the transplant list.

However, no one came forward as a match and he began to resign himself to giving up his job for a future on dialysis.

They are now recovering and Mr Shillcott is looking forward to getting back to normality and to returning to long distance running

He said: ‘I had been seeing my kidney function decrease and I was heading towards dialysis, I was not far off at all.

‘The plan was always to have dialysis because nobody had come forward to give me a kidney, there were just no matches.

It is a genetic condition that causes multiple cysts to develop on the kidneys.

Symptoms tend to begin in adulthood and include abdominal pain, high blood pressure and blood in the urine.

Over time the condition causes the kidneys to lose more and more of their function.

Eventually it can lead to kidney disease which has symptoms including tiredness, swollen ankles and shortness of breath.

There is no treatment so patients sometimes need dialysis or a transplant.

The condition affects one in every 1,000 people.

‘As my kidney function failed life had narrowed down to a sort of blinkered view of the future, I couldn't really do a lot and I was on half days because I needed to sleep so much.

‘Then out of the blue Chalkie offered me his kidney.

‘For a live donor the success rate is 98 per cent. There is always a risk and that chance it is going to fail but when someone says it is 98 per cent you have to go for it.’

After months of tests, they underwent surgery at Southmead Hospital, Bristol, on April 5.

Mr Czajkowski, from Wick St Lawrence, north Somerset, said: ‘Somebody told me one day that you don't have to be deceased to be a donor, you can give certain organs while you are still alive, and I have to confess that thought never really crossed my mind.

‘There is not enough publicity, everybody thinks you have to be dead, nobody really realises you can be a live donor.

‘I think that's why it's gone so well, the kidney was live and functioning really well, so it was a lot easier to transplant.’

The pair became friends because they both enjoy gardening on their allotments

Mr Shillcott, from Weston-super-Mare, is now looking forward to returning to a normal life and to resuming long distance running.

‘I'm very much into my running, I was running up to 40 miles a week, but I had to stop six or seven months ago,’ he said.

‘I really, really miss it so I'm really looking forward to getting back into it, I did the London Marathon three years ago so I look forward to doing that again.

‘They have told me I can do what I want, no food restrictions, nothing.

‘I intend to travel and do everything I couldn't. It had all gone so narrow and I couldn't really do any of that, now it has all opened up.’
