Four of Australia's most wanted criminal suspects have been caught in just one week since police released a shame file of fugitive mug shots and appealed for help from the public.

On 8 September, NSW Police Force's Operation Roam published details of 20 renegades they say are the most dangerous in the country - including photos of 18 of them - and have fled the state where the crimes they are wanted for occurred.

Rewards of up to $1 million are being offered for information that leads to the capture of some of the suspects.

The publicity worked. Tip-offs from members of the public calling in of reporting online led to the first arrest within 24 hours of the campaign being launched and three more since, said Peter Price, the Deputy Chairman of Crime Stoppers Australia.

'It varies from state to state, but our call ratio is up by around 20 per cent across the country because of this appeal for information,' he said.

'It obviously works. Everybody has a next door neighbour. Because of this campaign there is literally nowhere to hide. There is 20 million sets of eyes looking for them.'

The massive publicity initiative was used for the operation due to the nature of the offenders, who have each fled the states where a warrant has been issued for their arrest.

'All of these people basically have extradition warrants out against them which is why they are expected to be in a state other than where they were charged,' Mr Price said.

'This operation is targeting people who are roaming around Australia who are trying to evade the law.'

Those captured include Matthew Leslie Tune, 32, wanted in New South Wales in connection to an assault and robbery in the country town of Tamworth in March 2012.

Tune was found at a half-way house in Melbourne.

The three other men who have been arrested are Andrew John Bell, Nathan Glover and Scott John Heron.

Bell, 64, was allegedly involved in deceptions worth more than $100,000, assaults and thefts in Maryborough, Victoria, according to Crime Stoppers fugitive list. 

Glover, 20, is wanted for his alleged involvement in a serious assault in Wollongong, south of Sydney, in July 2013.

Heron, also 20, is wanted over an alleged sexual assault in Shepparton, Victoria.

Western Australia police are now focusing their efforts on Bern Neumann who is on the run  after escaping from prison during a release activity in February this year.

He was jailed for  serious drug offences and still has 11 years and 10 months to serve.

'The smallest piece of information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, can be the missing piece of a puzzle to solving a crime or locating a wanted person,' Mr  Price said.

The 16 remaining men are wanted for charges including murder, attempted murder, sexual assault, drug trafficking and robbery.

One such fugitive is South Australian man Stuart Pearce, who is wanted for questioning in the slaying of his wife and three children in 1991.

The chief executive officer of Crime Stoppers Victoria, Sam Hunter, warned that  the mobile nature of modern society enables suspects to move more fluidly through the nation.

'They may now be living in your neighbourhood,' Ms. Hunter said.

'They could be your neighbour or mechanic and have assumed another identity. They might catch the train in the morning.'

Police recommend that members of the public should not approach any suspected wanted persons, but call Triple Zero immediately.

Crime Stoppers can be contacted at 1800 333 000 or visited at their website.
