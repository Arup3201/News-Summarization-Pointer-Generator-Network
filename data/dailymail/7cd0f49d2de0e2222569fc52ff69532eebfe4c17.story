They stare into the camera with wide-eyed innocence.

But it will not be long before these cute kittens grow into powerful predators.

Two young wildcats, named Brave and Merida after the Disney characters, were born at the animal park at Kincraig run by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland.

Their arrival came as it emerged that as few as 400 of Scotland's wildcats survive in the wild, as the species is under threat from inter-breeding.

Experts have issued a fresh warning over the future of the Scottish  wildcat

DNA hope: A genetic test is currently under development which, if successful, will show definitively whether individual cats are pure-bred wildcats or hybrids

The new study found that wildcat numbers may have been overestimated

However, a new
 DNA test is offering hope that the species might survive. The test, 
which could be ready by Christmas, could identify which cats are 
pure-bred, and which are hybrid and pave the way for a breeding programme which could save the species.

It would allow for the testing of cats
 both in captivity and in the wild and for measures to be taken to 
protect those pure-bred wildcats that remained from being hybridised 
into extinction.

The current official estimate of 400 
Scottish wildcats remaining in the wild is an informed guess; the 
worst-case scenario ‘that there is none’ is a genuine possibility.

Douglas Richardson, animal collections
 manager at the Highland Wildlife Park, said: ‘We get our knickers in a 
twist because the Indians aren’t doing all they can to protect their 
tigers, or the Kenyans their black rhinos, but it’s OK for us to let 
this one slip through the net? I don’t think so. 

Last of its kind? With just 400 thought to remain in the wild and those under threat from inter-breeding these could be some of last pictures of Scotlands wildcats

The animals are one of the big attractions at the park in Kincraig, which is run by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland

‘Here we have this iconic emblem of the Highlands and if we don’t get our finger out, it will become extinct, guaranteed.’

Wildcats are the only remaining large mammal predator and the only surviving cat native to Britain.

Persecution and deforestation 
contributed to a drop in numbers during the 18th and 19th centuries, but
 although suitable habitat has increased again, their numbers have 
continued to dwindle, due partly to disease and road accidents, but 
mainly to interbreeding with domestic cats.

Douglas said: ‘If you let dogs run feral, people would be up in arms for a very good reason. Cats? They think it’s all right.

‘We don’t want to stop anyone having 
cats, but we want to shut off the taps of more animals going to live a 
feral existence and cross-breeding with wildcats.’

At risk:  The test, which could be ready by Christmas, would pave the way for further, much-needed wildcat conservation work
