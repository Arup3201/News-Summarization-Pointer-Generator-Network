Mrs May – famous for her daring kitten heels – chose a lifetime subscription to Vogue as her luxury item on the BBC's Desert Island Discs

She is the longest serving Home Secretary Britain has had in 50 years, and now Theresa May has revealed she is not shy of putting on her dancing shoes.

The politician said that Abba track - Dancing Queen - is one of her favourite records for 'something to jump up and down to' when she appeared on Desert Island Discs this morning.

She recalled donning a pair of flared trousers and a yellow blouse with 'huge voluminous sleeves', adding that 'my husband and I are sort of the Abba generation'.

But one of the 58-year-old's song choices on the Radio 4 programme may have raised some eyebrows, after she demanded that women be themselves in the workplace and not try to ape the antics of their male colleagues.

After telling host Kirsty Young that ‘women in politics, in business, in whatever field they’re in, should be able to do the job as themselves’, Mrs May then selected Walk Like A Man by the Four Seasons as a castaway track.

The song comes from the Broadway production of the musical The Jersey Boys. The Home Secretary says: ‘My husband and I went to see The Jersey Boys a few years ago. It’s a fantastic show – Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.’

Mrs May – famous for her daring kitten heels – chose a lifetime subscription to Vogue as her luxury item.

In a far-reaching interview, Mrs May, also recalls her shock at being assigned her own personal protection team when she was appointed Home Secretary in 2010, and reveals she has not driven a car since she took on the job.

But the former financial consultant says she rarely loses sleep despite having one of the toughest jobs in British politics. She said: ‘Fortunately, I am somebody who can sleep quite well, although I don’t get as many hours’ sleep as I might like. You are probably talking about five or six.’

Mrs May – the most powerful woman at Westminster and tipped by many to become a future leader of the Conservative Party – talks about her daily struggle with type 1 diabetes, the condition she revealed she suffered from in an interview with The Mail on Sunday last year.

She says: ‘I just get on and deal with it. I am on an insulin regime, so I am injecting four times a day.’

Mrs May declines to discuss her leadership ambitions and refuses to say how she will vote in an in/out referendum on Britain’s membership of the European Union.

Theresa May picked 'Dancing Queen' by Abba, pictured, as one of her Desert Island Discs and says it gives her 'something to jump up and down to'

But she apologises for twice failing to choose an appropriate chairman for the Home Office inquiry into how the political establishment dealt with allegations of child abuse from the 1970s and 1980s.

‘I am sorry that we’ve had two attempts to appoint a chairman and both of those have ended in the individuals feeling that they had to resign. We need to look at how we are going to vet individuals who come forward,’ she says.

Mrs May’s other Desert Island choice was a recording from the 1980s sitcom Yes, Minister - specifically an extract from the episode The Compassionate Society, performed by Derek Fowlds. 

Called The Compassionate Society, the episode is about a new hospital which is top-heavy with managers but has no medical staff or patients.

Young also pressed the home secretary about plans to lead her party but she responded: 'David Cameron is a first-class prime minister. I hope he will be doing it for a very long time.' 

Desert Island Discs was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 this morning but is repeated again at 9am on Friday.

She chose 'Walk Like A Man' from the Broadway production of the musical The Jersey Boys. She said: ‘My husband and I went to see it a few years ago. It’s a fantastic show – Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons'
