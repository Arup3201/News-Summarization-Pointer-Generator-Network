Bournemouth's Capital One Cup hero - who scored a late winner to see the Cherries reach the quarter finals at the expense of West Brom - talks to Sportsmail about everything from his sporting heroes to who would play him in a movie of his life...

Who is your sporting hero?

Thierry Henry. I’d always watch him play and try to base my game around him. We’re similar in that he was very pacy.

Wilson spent five years with Coventry before signing for Bournemouth in the summer

What would you be if you weren’t a sportsman?

I like watching the renovation shows on television and wouldn’t mind smashing a kitchen out and fitting new ones.

Which other sportsman would you like to be?

LeBron James. He’s an unbelievable basketballer to watch. And he’s making a fair amount of money too!

Career highlight? 

Scoring my first professional goal for Coventry. As a kid growing up in the city that’s something you dream about.

... And the worst moment?

Temporarily moving to Northampton’s ground Sixfields is up there. It wasn’t what any of us wanted but you’ve just got to get on with it.

If your house was burning down, what one possession would you save?

My mobile phone.

Favourite karaoke song?

I Believe I Can Fly by R Kelly. When I joined Bournemouth I sang it as my initiation. It went down well to be fair.

Most-listened to song on your ipod?

Lifestyle by a guy called Rich Homie — I’ve played that 1,000 times in a few weeks.

Last film you saw?

Paid in Full, an old-school film, on the way home from a game.

Last book you read?

I’m reading Bounce by Matthew Syed about sports psychology. I’m trying to get through it but it’s taking a while. I’m not the brightest spark.

Wilson chose to sing R Kelly's I Believe I Can Fly as his initiation song at Bournemouth

Favourite pre-match meal?

Chicken pasta before every game.

Can you cook? Best dish?

I can cook up a storm when I need to. Chicken, rice and peas — I’ve given it to my partner and her parents and they loved it. I was king for the day.

In a film of your life, who would YOU like to play you?

Denzel Washington  — I just watch anything that he’s in.

Denzel Washington, pictured in The Equalizer, would be Wilson's choice to play him in a film of his life

What’s the most expensive thing you’ve ever bought?

My house in Coventry. I’ve not sorted one in Bournemouth yet but should be soon.

Tell us a secret...

I was a kick-boxer when I was younger.
