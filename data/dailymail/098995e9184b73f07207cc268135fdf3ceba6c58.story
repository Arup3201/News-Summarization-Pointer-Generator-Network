A devoted father was jailed today for trying to turn his son into a star racing driver - by staging a £600,000 tax fiddle to pay for his cars.

Financial advisor Michael Jones, 60, carried out a complex tax fraud to fund his son's dream of becoming the next Lewis Hamilton.

A court heard Jones had spent a fortune paying for his son Nicholas, 23, to race across Europe, running up 'enormous debts' and even remortgaging the family home for £400,000 before he embarked on the tax fiddle.

Michael Jones, 60, was jailed today after admitting a tax scam designed to help his son Nicholas Jones, 23, pictured, in his dream of becoming a racing car driver

Prosecutor Roger Griffiths said: 'His son had a burning ambition to become a racing driver and he was a much-loved son who was loyally supported by his father.

'But it meant the taxpayer was funding the sporting ambition.'

Jones made bogus tax claims on lucrative advertising deals which he claimed his son had landed.  He also claimed his son had been given gifts of sponsorship from a dozen businesses backing his racing dream.

But Cardiff Crown Court heard that these did not exist - and Jones used his financial expertise to defraud the taxpayer of £140,625 in a scam involving £600,000.

Jones, of Castleton, near Cardiff, was jailed after he admitted making false statements, transferring criminal property and evasion of VAT.

Jones was sentenced to 32 months in prison after he admitted cheating HM Revenue and Customs.

Nick Jones, 23, was previously cleared of acting with his father to defraud the Revenue to fund his career

Judge Patrick Curran QC said: 'Your son’s burning ambition to be a racing driver was as much yours as it was his.

'Your motive was to assist your son's career and you had financial problems as a result of trying to support him.

'You designed a fraud, employing your expertise as an accountant and you involved others in it.

'Your son was in ignorance of the criminal nature of your scheme and he was duped by his own father.'

The court heard how Jones got his son interested in racing after taking him go-karting at the age of three.

Nicholas started racing karts before moving onto Mini Coopers and in 2009 he won the Welsh Sports and Saloon Car Champion.

Nicholas studied at Silverstone Motorsport Academy and travelled to Belgium to take part in the Renault Sport Clio Cup.

His son was also taken to court charged with being part of the swindle.

The aspiring racer told the court he had no idea his father was fiddling cash from the taxman to support his ambition to become a driving star, and was cleared after telling a jury: 'If I had known I would not have done it.'

Michael Jones invited 12 companies, most of them local, to purchase advertising on the website and race cars of Nick Jones Racing Ltd (NJR), of which he was company secretary.

The advertising did not materialise, but the participating companies falsely reclaimed the VAT.  The directors and sole traders were also personally reimbursed with a gift of 'tax-free' money.

Jones profited himself by falsifying the company accounts.  He failed to show the real income of the business, and when sponsors made payments to NJR, the money was often quickly transferred to his personal bank accounts within 24 hours.

As a result, he defrauded the HMRC out of £140,625.

Zoe Ellerbeck from the HMRC said: 'Michael Jones operated a scheme where he directly encouraged clients of his accountancy business, J&R Business Services Ltd, to advertise with NJR in order to commit VAT fraud.

'He also deliberately misrepresented NJR’s income to pocket tax that should have been paid to HMRC.'

She added: 'We are investing more resources than ever into tackling tax fraud and will not hesitate to investigate those who cheat the system and other law abiding people.'
