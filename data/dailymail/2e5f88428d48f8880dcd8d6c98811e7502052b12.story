Caught: Adam Bartsch allegedly took 10 to 12 photographs up women's skirts while on duty

A married federal air marshal has been arrested after allegedly using a cell phone to take photos up women's skirts as they boarded a plane at Nashville International Airport.

Adam Bartsch, 28, from Rockville, Maryland, was on duty on Southwest Airline Flight 3132 on Thursday when a heroic passenger noticed him taking as many as a dozen lewd photos.

When the witness, Rey Collazo, confronted Bartsch, he allegedly tried to delete the sick photographs - so Collazo reached for the phone.

'[I] struggled with him a
little bit and I got the better part of the phone and twisted and hit 
him with my right hand between the neck and the shoulder,' Collazo told WKRN.

'I looked at 
the guy and said, "Excuse me, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. You're a 
disgrace to a human being. To a man. That's wrong".'

Collazo then notified a Southwest Airlines flight attendant about the incident and Bartsch was taken off the flight and charged with disorderly conduct, a police report said.

Collazo said he was stunned when a detective called him later that night and revealed that Bartsch, who had been in plain clothes, was an air marshal.

During questioning, Bartsch told 
authorities that he took between 10 and 12 photographs and said that he 
had done it before, according to a police report.

Arrest: Bartsch, who is married, is pictured as he leaves the police station in Nashville on Thursday night

Shame: He ran from news cameras after being charged with unlawful photography and posting bail

The Transportation Security Administration said it is assisting with the investigation and that it takes the matter very seriously.

'TSA
does not tolerate criminal behavior,' it said in a statement.

'The 
agency immediately removed this individual from his current duties and 
is in the process of suspending or terminating his employment.'

Bartsch has been charged with unlawful 
photography and was released on a $10,000 bond around 9.30pm on 
Thursday. He is due in court on November 14.

He remained in Nashville overnight and it is not clear when he will be returned to Maryland, where he lives with his wife. Neighbors told WKRN they were stunned to hear of his arrest.

'He seemed like a nice guy,' one said. 'Every time I saw him he looked real calm. We'd briefly talk and that was it.'

Southwest Airlines said the flight to Tampa, Florida was not delayed by the incident.
