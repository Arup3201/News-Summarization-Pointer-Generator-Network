A man pulled up beside a mother and her three children before grabbing her seven-year-old daughter and driving off with her in the trunk of his car. 

But less than a minute after the girl was kidnapped in broad daylight, the child managed to open the car's trunk and jumped out in Sacramento, California.

She suffered only minor scratches and was taken to hospital where she was treated.

Snatched: The girl was thrown into the trunk of the man's car along this road in Sacramento

Authorities would not divulge exactly
how the child escaped but have released an image of a man they would 
like to speak in connection with the kidnapping.

Neighbours heard the girl's terrified mother scream for help who then called police.

Christian Covey heard tyres screeching and ran outside her home when she spotted the child.

'She was lying on the ground when I saw her,' she told Sacramento ABC affiliate News10. 

'I started talking to her and that's when she was telling us, 'he stole me, he stole me.'

Brave: Mrs Covey and her husband walked the girl back to her mother and told the child how proud they were of her

Mrs Covey and her husband walked the girl back to her mother and told her how proud they were of her.

She suffered only minor scratches after jumping from the moving car and was taken to hospital where she was treated.

Another neighbour said: 'This happened in broad daylight. How does a thing like this happen?'

The man is described as between 25 and 35 years old with light-brown skin, between 5ft 10in and 6ft tall, with black, shoulder-length hair worn in braids or dreadlocks.

Police have released this image fitting the description of man who kidnapped a girl in Sacramento, California

He believed to have been driving a dark green or blue four-door Sedan which had tinted windows. 

Authorities have said this is not the first time a child has been approached by a man in a car in the area recently.

Michele Gigante, of the Sacramento Police Department, told ABC News that last week an 11-year-old girl was told to get into a man's car but she ran away. 

According to Sacramento Sheriff’s Department spokesman Jason Ramos there are some similarities between the descriptions of the suspects from both incidents but the vehicle descriptions are different.
