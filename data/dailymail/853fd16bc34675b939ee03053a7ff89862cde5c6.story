Guilty: Phillip Challis was today jailed after he pleaded guilty to 17 sex offences at Kingston Crown Court

A former priest who raped and molested two boys for almost two decades has been jailed for 13 years.

Phillip Challis, 52, admitted 17 sexual offences carried out between 1991 and 2009 while he was a priest in Merton, southwest London.

He pleaded guilty to crimes including raping a child, indecent assault, attempted rape and taking indecent photographs.

Challis was caught by child abuse investigators in January after a 17-year-old boy came forward to say he had been abused by Challis since he was eight.

Police later found out that Challis had also abused a second male victim, who is now 29, since he was seven years old.

But a senior officer in the Metropolitan police today said it was 'entirely possible' that Challis abused more than two people.

He urged any further victims to speak to police in the hope of receiving justice.

Challis initially pleaded not guilty to the charges, but changed his plea after he was made aware of the evidence against him.

He was handed the prison sentence today at Kingston Crown Court in London.

Detective Superintendent Tariq Farooqi of the Metropolitan Police said: 'We are committed to investigating serious offences of this nature and ensuring dangerous offenders like Challis are brought to justice for their crimes.

'I am pleased that the weight of evidence forced Challis to change his plea, saving the victims from recounting their distressing experiences in court.

'It is entirely
possible there may be further victims and I would ask anyone who wishes to
report an offence to police to contact the Barnes Child Abuse Investigation.'
