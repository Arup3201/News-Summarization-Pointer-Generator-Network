The most remarkable aspect of England’s World Cup shambles is that all the FA top brass from chairman Greg Dyke downwards are united in wanting Roy Hodgson to remain as manager.

Even those from the FA hierarchy who have witnessed the two successive defeats in Brazil are staunchly in support of Hodgson, despite England heading for humiliation at the World Cup on a par with the Ashes fiasco last winter.

The same message that Hodgson should carry on regardless of England’s woeful showing came from FA chairman Greg Dyke and Ivan Gazidis, chairman of the International committee, as well as the other FA international delegates in Sao Paulo — Keith Lamb, Peter Barnes and Barry Taylor.

Staying put: The FA have insisted Roy Hodgson will remain as England coach despite the World Cup debacle

Aston Villa chief executive Paul Faulkner, temporary board member since Premier League chairman Anthony Fry was sidelined through serious illness, was another FA figure inside the Arena Corinthians who had no negative words about Hodgson.

In Brazil Dyke has been very vocal in attacking FIFA president Sepp Blatter, but would only say when asked about Hodgson’s position: ‘There’s another game to go.’

There has to be a root-and-branch review by the FA of whether it was worth having over 80 personnel in the official party.

Steve Peters, the highly acclaimed sports psychiatrist, has seemingly made little impact and cut a timid figure after matches when his main role was seemingly helping to carry the team equipment onto the coach.

When approached, he quickly referred any questions to the FA communications department.

The England media centre, installed at a cost of around £80,000 at Rio’s Urca military camp and the training pitch there — which was even more expensive to prepare — will have been used only eight times if England go out at the group stage.

That figure includes manager Roy Hodgson’s likely final Press conference next Wednesday.

The fall-out from an early England World Cup exit would reverberate across the FA.

Selling Wembley tickets for an unappetising September friendly against Norway will be that more difficult, as will finding the desired global roster of FA Cup sponsors and a new lead partner.

England will also lose some of its lustre as a marquee opponent for friendly internationals although, fortunately for the FA, long-term broadcast agreements at home and abroad are in place.

Zlatan Ibrahimovic, probably the best player in football not involved in the World Cup, has been a guest of his PSG club president Nasser Al Khelaifi on a trip to Brazil.

Zlatan has watched Chile beat Spain as well as Uruguay turn over England, with Ibrahimovic cheering on his PSG striker partner Edinson Cavani.

The FA have had plenty of people freeloading at the World Cup.

But Roger Burden, FA board member and former chairman of the Cheltenham and Gloucester Building Society, made sure he paid his own way to Sao Paulo to watch the Uruguay debacle.

And Burden, who withdrew his candidature for the FA chairmanship because he doesn’t trust Sepp Blatter’s FIFA, only took advantage of his FA position to hitch a lift on the team bus after the game.

The inquest into England’s dismal showing in Brazil will have to include the merits of having a Club England department within the FA concentrating solely on the national teams at various levels. Certainly England’s senior side performed better results-wise when the now sidelined FA International Committee had responsibility for team affairs.

Brian Moore, useless as a BBC rugby co-commentator, even worse as a talkSPORT contributor and unreadable in the Daily Telegraph, is obsessed with attacking your Sports Agenda columnist on Twitter.

Anyone trawling his near 50,000 postings would agree this ex-rugby hooker should be first in the queue to see sports psychiatrist Steve Peters on his imminent return from the World Cup.
