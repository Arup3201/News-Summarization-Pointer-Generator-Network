The kidnapper was arrested and removed from the hotel by waiting armed police.

Lucy Jordan, a freelance journalist who was on the scene in Brasilia, reported two of the kidnapper's demands - his first was the extradition of Cesare Battisti, an Italian left wing terrorist convicted of murders from Brazil to Italy.

He was also demanding the implementation of Brazil's 'clean record' law, a piece of the legislation already in place that aims to bar corrupt candidates from office - it known as Ficha Limpa.

Cesare Battisti, seen In 2007

Cesare Battisti is an Italian fugitive in Brazil.

The former left-wing rebel escaped from an Italian jail in 1981,  while awaiting trial for four murders in the 1970s, crimes allegedly committed when he was a member of the Armed Proletarians for Communism.

Battisti moved first to Mexico, then to France in 1990, where he became an author. 

Convicted of murder in absentia in 1990, he insists he is the victim of political persecution in Italy. 

He fled to Brazil in 2004 and has always denied the charges against him and walked free after the ruling from Brazil's supreme court in 2011. 

The hostage taker at one point threw an object from the balcony.  

After the event police didn't confirm whether there were actually explosives in the garment. 

'It has not been confirmed if the explosives are real -- we have taken all security measures,' a police spokesman said. 

The spokesman said the hostage taker had made a number of demands, including some of a political nature. 

Special Forces are also on the scene assessing the situation. 

The chairman of the Progressive Party (PP) of Combinado, Lindon Jonson Miguel da Silva, confirmed from pictures that the kidnapper is Souza dos Santo, the former Secretary of Agriculture and Livestock of the municipality, reports Fox News Latino.

'It was a big surprise for everyone. 

'He is a very good guy...We are praying for the family,' Jonson said, according to O Globo.

'No question it is psychological.'
