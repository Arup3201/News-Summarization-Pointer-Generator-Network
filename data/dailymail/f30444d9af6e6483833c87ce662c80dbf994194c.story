Vladimir Putin's widely publicised discovery of ancient Greek vases while on a Black Sea diving expedition was staged, his chief spokesman has admitted.

The Russian prime minister had posed for cameras with the pottery fragments, after his August dive in the Kerch Strait that connects the Black and Azov seas.

In footage of the dive, Mr Putin holds 
two fragments of what are said to be 6th century B.C. Greek jugs and 
says 'the boys and I found them' in about six feet of clear water.

But his spokesman Dmitry Peskov said in an interview shown Tuesday on the Dozhd TV channel that the jugs had been found earlier by archaeologists and placed there for Mr Putin.

'Look, Putin didn't find down there jugs that had lain there for many thousands of years. It's obvious,' Mr Peskov said in response to questions from the interviewers.

'Of course, they were found in the course of an expedition several weeks or days earlier,' he said.

'Of course, they were left there or placed there. It's completely normal. There's no reason to gloat about this and everything else.'Â 

Mr Putin is noted for his habit of appearing 
in vigorous and adventurous settings, including fishing and hunting 
while stripped to the waist and riding with leather-clad bikers.

Mr Peskov's comments were an unusually candid glimpse into the cultivation of Mr Putin's image as a tough man of action.

Previous appearances, which have shown Mr Putin hunting, riding horseback and admiring a tranquilised polar bear, have boosted his popularity, but have also prompted bitter comments on blogs and social media.

Mr Peskov's rare interview with a television station that has been critical of the government could reflect authorities' concerns about a negative attitude to Mr Putin's re-election bid among the nation's intellectuals and middle class.

Mr Putin, who was president in 2000-2008, is almost certain to return to the Kremlin in next March's election.

He and President Dmitry Medvedev announced last month they had agreed that Mr Putin would run for the presidency and Mr Medvedev would be named prime minister.

Yesterday the MailOnline reported how an all-women sect had chosen to worship Mr Putin as the reincarnation of St Paul the Apostle, one of the most influential early Christian missionaries.
