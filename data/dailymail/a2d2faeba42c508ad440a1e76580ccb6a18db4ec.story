A massive multimillion degree gas cloud has been discovered in a galaxy 60 million light years from Earth.

The cloud is likely to have been caused by a huge drawn-out collision between a dwarf galaxy and a much larger galaxy - and this collision could continue for another 50 million years.

If this is confirmed, it will be the first time such a collision has been detected in X-rays, and could help unlock the secrets of how galaxies grow.

An image combining X-rays and optical light shows the scene of this collision. The impact between the dwarf galaxy and the spiral galaxy caused a shock wave - akin to a sonic boom on Earth - that generated hot gas with a temperature of about 6 million degrees

The impact between the dwarf galaxy and the spiral galaxy caused a shock wave - similar to a sonic boom on Earth - that generated hot gas with a temperature of about six million degrees.

The observations, made using Nasa's Chandra X-ray Observatory, show the hot gas has a comet-like appearance, caused by the motion of the dwarf galaxy.

Astronomers believe star formation may have been triggered by the shock wave, producing bright, massive stars.

Earlier this week, Nasa detected in X-rays a planet outside our solar system pass in front of its parent star.

The
image was taken of a planet in HD 189733- a system which is 63 
light-years from Earth - using  Chandra and the 
European Space Agency’s XMM Newton Observatory.

Up
until now, exoplanets had only been observed passing in front of their 
parent stars using optical light in a process known as transiting.

The
planet, known as HD 189733b, is a hot Jupiter, meaning it is similar in
size to Jupiter in our solar system but in very close orbit around its 
star.It is more than 30 times closer to its star than Earth is to the sun and orbits its star once every 2.2 days.

The mass of the entire gas cloud is unknown because the two dimensional image can’t show whether the hot gas is concentrated in a thin pancake or distributed over a large, spherical region.

If the gas is a pancake, the mass is equivalent to forty thousand suns.

If it is spread out uniformly, the mass could be much larger, about three million times as massive as the sun.

According to Nasa, the hot gas should continue to glow in X-rays for tens to hundreds of millions of years.

They believe searching for large regions of hot gas in galaxies might be a way to estimate the frequency of collisions with dwarf galaxies and to understand how important such events are to galaxy growth.

An alternative explanation is that the hot gas cloud could have been produced by supernovas and hot winds from large numbers of massive stars.

However, Nasa claims this is unlikely because of the lack of evidence of expected radio, infrared, or optical features.
