A millionaire oil executive who was forced to hand over his £2million London townhouse to his ex-wife 'deserved everything he got', an appeal judge has ruled.

Dr Hussain Rabia, 60, tried to hide his true wealth in a bitter divorce battle by claiming he had no interest in an offshore consultancy business, which was said to be raking in huge profits.

But a family judge ruling on his divorce to ex-wife Azhar, 40, said Dr Rabia's denials about his wealth were 'manifestly untrue' and designed to conceal the real extent of his fortune.

It led to the couple's former matrimonial home, a £2million five-bed house in affluent Ealing, west London being handed to his ex-wife.

Dr Rabia appealed claiming the result was that his ex-wife had received more than her fair share of the family’s £3million-plus fortune.

But his case was thrown out by Appeal Court judge Lord Justice McFarlane, who said Dr Rabia had taken the risk of concealing his financial affairs and lost.

He said: ‘There has been a wholesale failure by the husband to provide any meaningful disclosure in the proceedings.

‘A husband who chooses to approach the litigation in the way this husband did has to run the risk of inferences being drawn against him.’

Dr Rabia separated from his wife in 2012 after a 14-year marriage, during which they had three children, all now of school age.

Battle: The fight was over this £2m house in Ealing, west London, which was awarded to Dr Rabia's ex-wife

He had worked as an engineer for British Gas, but took early retirement in 1998 and set up a consultancy, and later the business, Entrac Petroleum Ltd.

But when the divorce reached court last year, he refused to reveal full details of the company’s dealings outside of the UK.

His barrister, Valentine Le Grice QC, admitted at the Court of Appeal that although Dr Rabia had disclosed the business in the UK, he ‘did not disclose’ its more profitable work in the Middle East.

Criticising Dr Rabia as a witness in October last year, the family judge, Judge Isobel Plumstead, said she was ‘fully sceptical about his reliability’.

She said the business was ‘substantial’ and held sizeable assets in offshore accounts. 

But appealing today, Mr Le Grice argued that there was insufficient evidence on which Judge Plumstead could find that there was more money which Dr Rabia could lay his hands on. 

Mr Le Grice said: ‘The judge’s order did not produce an equal, or even broadly equal, division of the family resources.'

But rejecting his case, Lord Justice McFarlane said Dr Rabia’s ‘stoic non-disclosure’ had left his ex-wife’s lawyers ‘painstakingly putting together a jigsaw puzzle’ to get to the bottom of what his true assets were.

He said: ‘It is entirely proper for a court facing stoic non-disclosure such as this to consider drawing adverse inferences against the party failing to come clean.’

He rejected Dr Rabia’s appeal bid and refused him permission to challenge the order that he pay £140,000 towards his ex-wife’s legal costs of the case.

Speaking afterwards, Mrs Rabia said: ‘The decision by the Court of Appeal to uphold the judgment reinforces the faith that I have always had that there is real justice for everyone in this country.

‘I feel that I have been treated fairly by the court, given everything that I have been through over recent years.’

Her solicitor Julian Ribet, of family law firm Levison Meltzer Pigott, said: ‘Pivotal to this case was the husband’s actions in trying to conceal the extent of his wealth from the court and his wife.

‘In doing so, Dr Rabia has not only wasted a significant amount of judicial and court time – a valuable resource; in addition he has shown himself to be contemptuous of the very process which is designed to deliver a fair decision in such proceedings.

‘In dismissing his appeal and upholding the heavy costs penalty, the court has given a strong message that this kind of behaviour will not be tolerated.’
