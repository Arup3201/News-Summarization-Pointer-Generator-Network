Pauline Hanson's is ready to again shake up the main political game, announcing that she is set to lead the One Nation party once more.

Ms Hanson confirmed to Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday that she has returned to her former party and will aim to have the name officially changed to Pauline Hanson's One Nation.

And the outspoken and often controversial politician has wasted no time in making her mark, declaring that Palmer United Party's Jacqui Lambie, who has been dumped as the party's deputy Senate leader: 'Is walking in my shoes'.

Hanson has announced her return to the One Nation party to become its leader after a 12-year hiatus

Ms Hanson started political career as an Ipswich Councillor in 1994

She has also set her sights on old political foe Tony Abbott labelling the G20 Summit 'was all about grandstanding by supposed world leaders and a huge waste of taxpayer money'.

'I know where the $470 million could have been better spent on Australians,' she added.

'And what do we really know of the free trade deal with China? We will get rid of our tariffs from day one but what about them, they have still got their tariffs in place, when will the Chinese act on that, we haven't been told.

And the US President was not immune to criticism.

'They all seem to forget that they were put there to serve the people. Barack Obama, with the rewiring and redoing of a hotel, they are not world leaders,' she told DMA. 

However, Ms Hanson, 60, freely admits that her family is not entirely convinced about her return.

Pauline Hanson began her political career as an Ipswich Councillor before being voted into the House of Representatives in 1996 as Member for Oxley

'My children do worry for me going back into it but the people of Australia want and deserve an honest voice' said Pauline Hanson as she announced her return to the main political game

A familiar face on the hustings again. Pauline Hanson has vowed to take voter support away from the major parties at the next Queensland and Federal elections

Pauline Hanson co-founded the One Nation Party in 1997 and is set to be reconfirmed as the party leader at a November 29 meeting of members

'My children do worry for me going back into it but the people of Australia want and deserve an honest voice, so they want to know what's going on,' she told DMA.

The plan is to take control of the party she co-founded and the change of name will be put to Queensland members on November 29.

First target is the Queensland State Election and then the Federal poll in two years time.

But, she also admits that there is much work to be done to rebuild the once powerful but now ailing party.

'There are not many members left, it is going to be a big job to revitalise the party but I am determined to,' Ms Hanson said.

'I have already backed one candidate in the past week and have a few others in mind.' 

Her political career has been as controversial as it has been colourful. Ms Hanson's "please explain" retort to a television interviewer's question as to whether she was xenophobic has followed her throughout public life. 

Her initial foray was in fact as a councillor in Ipswich and then, ahead of the 1996 Federal Election, Ms Hanson was disendorsed by the Liberal Party. She would go on to win the seat of Oxley and stood as an Independent MP and a year later the One Nation Party would enter Australia's political landscape.

At the two subsequent elections, with redistribution effectively forcing her out of Oxley and into Blair, Ms Hanson would prove unsuccessful despite enjoying very strong primary support.  

Internal party disputes and allegations further eroded her public backing and then in 2003 Pauline Hanson was convicted of electoral fraud and sent to three years jail.

She would spend 11 weeks in prison before the Queensland Court of Appeal quashed the conviction and ordered her immediate release.

Unsuccessful tilts at both the NSW and Queensland State elections would follow, as would two more ultimately failed attempts to regain a seat in Federal parliament at the 2007 and 2013 polls.

Pauline Hanson said that Palmer United Party's Jacqui Lambie, who has been dumped as the party's deputy Senate leader, 'is walking in my shoes'

Pauline Hanson said the G20 Summit was nothing more than 'political grandstanding and a waste of taxpayers money'

The decision to return to politics, she says, was prompted by her disappointment at the current crop of politicians.

'I'm very disillusioned by it and I honestly believe I can make a difference,' she told Daily Mail Australia.

'I'm sick and tired of all the corruption and lies and there is too much interest in overseas interest.'

Despite her support for Senator Lambie she said it had become clear to her that Clive Palmer's PUP group was not going to be the alternative third major party Australians were hoping for.

'I'm very disillusioned by it and I honestly believe I can make a difference' said Pauline Hanson

'I was hoping Clive Palmer and his party would be able to do it but they haven't,' she said. 

'How can you criticise Jacqui Lambie? I won't, she has stood up for what she believes in and in some ways she is being that individual on the floor of parliament that I was, I can't criticise that. 

'I've been sent to prison and ridiculed all my political life but I haven't given up.

'I got pushed out of my own party in 2002 but I rejoined last year and now it's time to rebuild it.

'This is a huge decision for me but I have always tried to keep Australians aware of what is going on.

'They describe me as far right wing, I am not, I am centre and that's what Australians want. They want to know about their jobs, the home they hope they can afford and if they get sick that they will get a hospital bed.'

She sounded a warning to the major parties saying 'they know I can take away their voter base, like I did before'. 

The One Nation website calls her 'the redhead you can trust'. Pauline Hanson is set to take leadership of the party she co-founded almost 20 years ago
