A Labour MP launched an attack on the Natural History Museum and Marks & Spencer last night over a range of dinosaur clothes for boys.

Frontbencher Chi Onwurah accused both the retailer and the museum of sexism over the joint range, saying it excluded girls from science.

The shadow cabinet office minister said the Natural History Museum was guilty of ‘gender-specific marketing’, and that she plans to join a protest outside the building next week.

Attack: Shadow cabinet office minister Chi Onwurah has accused Marks & Spencer and the Natural History Museum of 'gender-specific marketing’ over range of dinosaur tshirts

But a spokesman for the attraction questioned her agenda, telling the Mail: ‘In the run up to the election, she has her own motivations’. 

The launch of the clothing range in January sparked a huge row, with critics accusing both the museum and the retailer of sexism.

The range of clothes produced by M&S in partnership with the museum – which is famous for its dinosaur exhibition – includes pyjamas and t-shirts with images of dinosaurs on them.

Campaigners said it was wrong only to target boys with the clothes and that girls should also be encouraged to take an interest in natural history.

Yesterday Miss Onwurah wrote on Twitter: ‘If you’re in London next Monday help tell the dinosaurs in @NHM_London girls want a share in science too #hearusroar.

She also tabled a series of questions in Parliament accusing the museum of ‘gender specific marketing of toys’ and failing to ‘target boys and girls equally’.

Criticism of the range has been led by the ‘Let Clothes Be Clothes’ campaign.

When the row first exploded the group’s co-founder Ruth Lopardo said: ‘I was astounded a national museum, which ought to have a clear access-forall policy, should license designs to M&S that are only marketed at boys.

‘How have these two national institutions, M&S and the Natural History Museum, managed to get through the entire product development cycle, from the initial idea to the product on the shelf, without anyone thinking that perhaps dinosaurs and natural science don’t just appeal to boys?’

A Marks&Spencer spokesman said: ‘This is a brand new partnership and, as with any new range, we have listened carefully to feedback from our customers on how they would like to see it evolve.

‘Our design team is working with the Natural History Museum on expanding the range to include products for girls.’

A spokesman for the Natural History Museum said: ‘We are currently working with the Marks and Spencer design team to expand the range to include products for girls. Licensing retail items plays an important role in generating revenue to help fund our work.

‘The Natural History Museum is passionate about science learning and careers for all. Products in the Museum shop are displayed without gender differentiation for children.’
