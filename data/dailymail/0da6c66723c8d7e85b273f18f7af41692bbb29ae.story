During his 32 years as church patriarch, he traveled to every continent and gave more than 18,000 blessings. 

Smith, the great-great-great-nephew of Mormon church founder Joseph Smith Jr, had been an emeritus church patriarch since 1979.

Historian Richard Bushman, an ordained LDS patriarch, told the Salt Lake Tribune: 'Though I didn’t know him personally, Eldred Smith embodied the Mormon patriarchal ideal - that we are connected in our families going back through time - and brought it into the 20th century.

'No one spoke as long and as effectively about Joseph Smith as Patriarch Smith. His passing will be a loss.'
