Gareth Bale faces a race against time to prove his fitness for Real Madrid's trip to Liverpool on Wednesday night - and looks increasingly likely to miss out with a muscle strain. 

Bale sat out of his first league game of the season against Levante at the weekend and coach Carlo Ancelotti confirmed it was not part of his rotation policy. 

The player has a strain in the pyramidalis muscle where the thigh meets the buttock and looks extremely unlikely to start at Anfield.

Gareth Bale is a doubt for Real Madrid's Champions League game away at Liverpool on Wednesday

The Welshman (right, training with Cristiano Ronaldo) was an unused substitute against Levante on Saturday

After his injury-interrupted the start to last season, Bale was on the brink of becoming the only player at Real Madrid to have started all eight of Real Madrid’s games in the league so far this time. 

But returning from international duty with Wales, his injury-free run has ended. The bad news for Liverpool is Real Madrid won 5-0 without Bale at the weekend and gave their most impressive performance of the campaign with last season’s big signing from Malaga, Isco, giving a virtuoso display in midfield.

He would have stepped down for the European clash but now looks set to stay in the team as Bale tries to get fit for El Clasico at the weekend.
