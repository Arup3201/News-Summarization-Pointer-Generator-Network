A fatal shooting at a federal immigration office last night took place while a 45-year-old agent was being counselled on his job performance by a high-ranking official, the FBI revealed today.

Several shots were fired just before 6pm on Thursday in the Immigration Customs Enforcement office in the Los Angeles suburb of Long Beach, California, leaving agent Kevin Kozak, 51, wounded.

The gunman, supervisory special agent Ezequiel Garcia, 45, died at the scene and the wounded Mr Kozak, the Los Angeles deputy special agent, was taken to hospital, where he was listed as stable.

Scene: Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers were shot in this building in Long Beach, California

Tragedy: Officers enter the lobby of the Federal Building after two ICE agents were shot on Thursday inside the agency's offices in the Los Angeles suburb of Long Beach and one died at the scene

Gathering: The shooting happened on the seventh floor of the Glenn M. Anderson Federal Building in Long Beach that houses ICE, the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Probation and Parole Office

Mr Garcia was killed by an agent 
who intervened after Mr Kozak had been shot six times. Mr Kozak was 
alert and talking on Friday - and ICE special agent in charge Claude Arnold paid tribute to him.

‘He is a fighter and I believe that's 
why he's alive today,’ Mr Arnold said.

‘He refused to succumb to his 
injuries - and in law enforcement that's what makes the difference 
between people who go home at the end of the day and those who don't.’

Mr Kozak, the second in command of the
Los Angeles area, reportedly denied Mr Garcia’s request for an internal
transfer. There were conflicting early reports about the number of 
people shot.

Local police said two were dead and 
one wounded, while ICE said one was dead and one wounded. The shooting 
is now being probed by ICE investigators, the FBI and Long Beach police.

Response: The shooting, described as an 'isolated incident' by the FBI, erupted during rush hour near Los Angeles and prompted police to shut down streets and a major intersection for more than an hour

The third agent is on administrative 
leave and his identity is being withheld. The Long Beach federal 
building houses ICE, the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Probation
and Parole Office.

'At times like this words honestly seem 
inadequate. When something like this happens in our offices, it's 
incomprehensible'

Claude Arnold, Immigration Customs Enforcement Special Agent in Charge

The injured agent sustained wounds to 
multiple parts of his body but his vital signs were ‘good for now’, St. 
Mary's Medical Center Trauma Director James Murray told CBS affiliate 
KCAL.

‘At times like this words honestly 
seem inadequate,' Mr Arnold said earlier. 'When something like this happens in 
our offices, it's incomprehensible.'

The shooting, described as an 
‘isolated incident’ by the FBI, erupted during rush hour near Los 
Angeles and prompted police to shut down streets and a major 
intersection for more than an hour.

'Obviously, there's still many 
questions that remain to be answered,' Mr Arnold told the Los Angeles 
Times earlier. 'Our hearts go out to all those who have been affected.'
