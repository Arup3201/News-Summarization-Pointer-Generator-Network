From portraits of Star Wars characters to edible versions of marine creatures, a 34-year-old illustrator has created a range of pancakes in the shape of famous faces, animals and even places.

Nathan Shields, of Port Angeles, Washington, started making the pancakes as a way of entertaining his children, Gryphon, 6, and Alice, 3.

The elaborately designed pancakes however have now become a weekly fixture and Mr Shields has documented more than 100 of the breakfasts.

Using a squeeze bottle, intended for condiments, Mr Shields is able to control the pancake batter, which he squeezes on to a good non-stick pan.

He draws the darker details first, allowing the batter to brown for longer.

Mr Shields, a former maths teacher, said: 'I found myself in charge of our young children, with a lot of free time.

'I made some vehicles one morning, which the kids found quite entertaining. 'The next week I tried some animal shapes, encouraged by friends who saw the picture on Facebook.'

The designs are a mixture of requests from his children and themes he finds interesting and wants to share with his young son and daughter.
