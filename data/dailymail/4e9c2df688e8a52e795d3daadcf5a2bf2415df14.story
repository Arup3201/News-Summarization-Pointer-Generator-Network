More than 250 protesters rallied against Ukip in Margate today as the party's conference came to a close.

Thanet Stand Up To UKIP outnumbered about 50 party supporters who were in the seaside town for the annual two-day spring conference.

Scuffles led to one woman being arrested on suspicion of common assault, however it is not clear whether she was a protester or a supporter of the party.

Scores of protesters could be seen marching along the seafront carrying placards and banners earlier this afternoon.  

A Kent Police spokeswoman said all protest groups were co-operating with police.

'There have been some very minor verbal exchanges,' she said.

'No-one has been injured and the protest has generally been conducted peacefully.

'Officers remain in the local area to reassure the public and to respond to any incidents if required.'

Inside the conference, former boxing promoter Kellie Maloney received a standing ovation after delivering an emotional speech.

Delegates gathered inside the conference to listen to Ms Maloney, who was praised by Nigel Farage

Ms Maloney was close to tears as she read a moving poem about a transsexual who committed suicide at the annual meeting in Margate, Kent.

The longtime Ukip supporter was also praised by Nigel Farage as proof that his party was 'open to everyone'.

Ms Maloney started her speech by apologising for homophobic comments she made while standing to become London Mayor in 2004.

At the time, the high-profile promoter said she would not campaign in Camden because there were 'too many gays'.

'I made a terrible mistake in 2004 when I made a derogatory remark about the gay community, and to them I apologise.
