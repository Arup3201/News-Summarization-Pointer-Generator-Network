Comedy panel shows may be considered by some as one of the lowest forms of humour - but top comedian David Mitchell insists that they are in fact wittier than sitcoms or sketch shows.

The popular funnyman has written his own sketch show and hosted panel programmes as well as appearing in long-running sitcom Peep Show.

He said today that of all the forms of comedy, panels give the greatest scope for spontaneous creativity because they are improvised by skilled comedians.

Panel show: David Mitchell, who will soon by appearing on Was It Something I Said? with Micky Flanagan and Richard Ayoade, has defended the controversial TV format

Mr Mitchell, whose new panel show is about to debut on Channel 4, was responding to claims by writer Charlie Higson that scripted comedy had been squeezed out of the schedules by cheaper alternatives.

The former Fast Show star told Radio Times that there had been no successful sketch shows since Little Britain, adding: 'They are quite expensive to make and panel shows are also cheaper.'

But Mr Mitchell, 39, suggested that the rise of panel shows might be no bad thing - despite having made his name in Peep Show and sketch show That Mitchell and Webb Look.

He said that his forthcoming show, Was It Something I Said?, provided a level of spontaneity which could not be matched by scripted comedy.

Origins: Mr Mitchell first made his name on Channel 4 sitcom Peep Show alongside Robert Webb

Was It Something I Said? (Channel 4):
David Mitchell's new show, also featuring Richard Ayoade and Micky 
Flanagan, is based on quotations and premieres on October 6.

Would
I Lie to You? (BBC1): The comedian has been a team captain on the show,
in which guests try to discern truth from falsehood, since it started 
in 2007.

The Bubble 
(BBC2): Mr Mitchell hosted the 2010 show in which celebrities were kept 
in isolation for a week and then made to work out what had really 
happened in the news in their absence.

The
Unbelievable Truth (Radio 4): He also presents the long-running radio 
show in which guests give made-up lectures mixing lies with true facts.

Other
shows: Mr Mitchell has been a popular presence as a guest on QI, Have I
Got News for You, Mock the Week, 8 Out of 10 Cats and The Big Fat Quiz 
of the Year.

'There was a quote from Catherine Zeta Jones about playing golf with her husband Michael Douglas,' he told the Independent.
'We essentially all started to imagine the scene of the two of them 
playing golf and that was very enjoyable and turned into a really fun 
bit of TV.

'It is 
moments like that which, for me, justify the existence of panel shows 
because no-one would ever have written those words. It purely came out 
of that combination of people which proves panel shows can produce funny
TV in a way you could never write into a sitcom or a sketch show and 
thereby justifies its place on screen.'

The
programme, which debuts next weekend and features Micky Flanagan and 
Richard Ayoade as team captains, is based on questions about quotations 
and tweets.

It is not the first panel show on which Mr Mitchell has regularly featured - he is a team captain on Would I Lie to You?, and hosted BBC2's short-lived The Bubble.

In addition, he has been a frequent guest on Britain's most popular panel shows such as Have I Got News for You, Mock the Week, 8 Out of 10 Cats and QI.

He said that the key to a good panel show is allowing the guests the space to come up with creative jokes.

'Usually the panellists are people who are bright and want to talk, and you need them to keep talking so you can't slap them down hard because they might go quiet and then you're stuck,' he added.

'You never know in that kind of comic situation where a chat is going and some of the best material comes when things are allowed to run and breathe.'
