Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers is keen for England to protect his teenage prodigy Raheem Sterling for the upcoming Euro 2016 qualifiers against Estonia and San Marino.

Rodgers has already lost two of his players Daniel Sturridge and Emre Can to injuries sustained on international duty and does not see the need for Sterling, the rising star of English football, to play the full 180 minutes against two nations Roy Hodgson’s men can be expected to beat comfortably.

The Liverpool manager was critical of the way England handled Sturridge during the last international break when the striker returned to Merseyside with a thigh injury.

Choosing his words carefully so he could not be accused of telling Hodgson which team to pick, Rodgers said about Sterling: ‘It is easy to say he is 19 and can play every day of the week but it doesn’t work like that.

‘Human beings don’t work like that. It is nature there will come periods when they need the rest. I would think that Roy and his staff would have a look at things.

‘He’ll want to ensure the games are won but I am sure it [protecting players] will be an objective when you are winning a game comfortably.

‘We lost the young boy Emre Can when Germany under-21s were 6-0 up against Romania on an awful pitch. 

‘The England manager, the England staff, they get paid their salary, they make the decisions. I think they are clever enough to hopefully work with the clubs and they can get success from having fit players. 

‘I am not here to tell the England staff how to do their job. It is one of the biggest jobs as a manager, maximising the available talent, managing them on and off the field. It is probably something I am sure will happen.’

Sterling has gained a big international reputation since his performances at the World Cup and was followed everywhere on the pitch during Liverpool’s Champions League win against Ludogorets – something he can expect to happen again when the European campaign continues in Basle on Wednesday night.

Rodgers is determined the youngster does not fall victim to burn-out or foul play, hence fears over the limited but physical defenders of San Marino, whom England face at Wembley on October 9, three days before the game in Estonia.

‘It is pretty clear from the games this season, and I saw it in pre-season, that he sometimes has two and three men around him. Is it affecting his performances? Not really. He has been brilliant so far and he’ll hopefully continue to keep that consistency in his game,’ added the Liverpool boss.

Behind Rodgers’ concerns over Sterling’s next get-together with England is what happened to Sturridge.

The Liverpool boss disclosed that England’s sports science and medical team had spent three-and-a-half hours with club specialists discussing the injury record and recovery time required for each Anfield player.

But despite the planning, 25-year-old Sturridge then aggravated a thigh problem during an England training session Rodgers clearly felt was unwise for him to participate in. Sturridge subsequently missed England’s opening Euro 2016 qualifying win away to Switzerland.

Rodgers said pointedly: ‘We put time into trying to help the associations when they want it. Obviously, we would hope then that that could be respected.’
