At the age of just 28, Carly Perkins is facing the fact she has a high risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer as she is a carrier of the deadly BRCA1 gene.

Now Carly, from Crawley, has taken the brave decision to have a double mastectomy this month to reduce her chances of one day developing the disease.

The young mother told the MailOnline her decision to have surgery was a 'no brainer' but her ordeal has been helped thanks to Michelle Heaton going through the same procedure.

Cancer risk: Carly Perkins, pictured with her daughter Tilly, is a carrier of the deadly BRCA1 gene

She said: 'Michelle Heaton has been a role model for me to look up to. There's not much support for people my age going through this but she has brought it into the public eye. As she has been so open about what she's been through, it has made me feel like I can be more open too.

'Before some of my friends didn't understand why I was having my breasts removed when I don't actually have cancer. Now it's easier to say, 'I have what Michelle Heaton has,' and they understand.

Michelle, 33, had a double mastectomy last year after discovering she was a carrier of the  BRCA2 gene. The gene means carriers have an 85 per cent chance of getting breast cancer and a 60 
per cent chance of contracting ovarian cancer in her lifetime.

She said at the time she was under-going the operation for the sake of her daughter, Faith, 14 months.

Putting the condition in the public eye: Carly said it has helped her seeing another young mother, singer Michelle Heaton, pictured with daughter Faith, going through the same thing

'As a mum you never want to anticipate leaving your child 
without a mum. The whole point of this was to get the dark cloud away 
from my head and to get on with life, and I'm on that path now so I just
want to look towards the future,' Michelle said.

Carly, who is a mother to Tilly, 16 months, said she feels exactly the same way. Her own mother developed breast cancer when she was a teenager (she since recovered after treatment) and her aunt died last year in her fifties after contracting ovarian cancer.

After seeing what her mother and aunt went through, Carly said she would hate for her own daughter to see her battling cancer.

'I don't want my daughter to see me 
suffering from cancer. As soon as I found out I carried the gene, it was a not a 
case of 'if' but 'when' I would have a mastectomy'

She said: 'I saw my mum suffer from cancer growing up,
it's really hard to see someone you love like that.

'I don't want my daughter to see me suffering. As soon as I found out I carried the gene, it was a not a case of 'if' but 'when' I would have a mastectomy. Having it now means Tilly will be too young to remember any of it.'

Carly said she has the full support of her family and partner, Damian, which made the decision to have a  mastectomy easier.

'Damian has been completely supportive, he just wants me to get it done. If I wasn't in a stable relationship I might have felt differently but as I know I've met my partner for life, it doesn't bother me to have a mastectomy,' she said.

Carly is scheduled to have her operation on March 22 and said seeing Michelle back performing with Liberty X on the Big Reunion tour so soon after her surgery has been reassuring.

Reassuring: After having a double mastectomy at the end of last year, Michelle has already returned to performing with reformed Liberty X. Carly said it has helped seeing how quickly she has recovered

'It has been nice to see how quickly she has recovered,' she said.

As Carly wants to have more children, she will not yet have her ovaries removed. Doctors also recommend women don't do this until their late thirties or early forties because the risk of developing ovarian cancer is lower and the operation can bring on symptoms of the menopause.

There is a chance that Carly will have passed the  BRCA1 gene on to her daughter but said she will wait until she is at least 18 to discuss it with her and see if she then wants to be tested.

She said: 'I found out at 28 and it was a lot to get my head around. So I won't tell her till she's at least 18, even then she might be too young to handle it. If she does have the gene I will fully support her and I can help her from my own experience.'

BRCA1 and BRCA2 are human genes that belong to a class known as tumor suppressors. Mutation of these genes has been linked to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer

A woman's risk of developing breast and/or ovarian cancer is greatly increased if she inherits a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Men with these mutations also have an increased risk of breast cancer

Gene faults are extremely rare with only about 1 in 20 cases of breast cancer associated with a faulty inherited gene

If women have concerns about their family history of breast cancer, they should go see their GP.  If their family history suggests they might be at increased risk of developing breast cancer, the GP may refer them on to a specialist family history or genetics service where their options for genetic testing and/or managing their risk can be discussed
