Dogs donning hats, crowns, tutus and frocks battled to be named the capital's best dressed dog at a fashion show in London at the weekend.

The annual Old Spitalfields Market Paw Pageant was held yesterday where dogs wearing their finest fashion competed to help raise money for Battersea Dogs and Cats Home.

Accompanying them were humans modelling collections from NW3, Oliver Bonas, Albam, Jigsaw Menswear, Hackett, Traffic People, Jones and Jones and Shoe Embassy.

Categories included Radient Rescue for the adopted pups, Dog's Got Talent for the skilled and Dressed Up to the Canines for the fashion-conscious.

The winners of the preliminary categories then competed for the Best in Show award, which went to Gus the Tibetan Terrier, who was smartly dressed in a shirt, tie and suit jacket.

All the dogs competing were dressed by Lilly Shahravesh of LoveMyDog, a leading designer of 'canine couture' based in Britain.
