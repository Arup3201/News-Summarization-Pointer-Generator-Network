It may not have attracted the massive queues of previous launches, but Apple has revealed the sales of its new iPad mini were anything but small.

The computer giant said today it has sold three million iPads in just three days since the launch of its new iPad mini and fourth generation iPad.

The figures doubles the previous record of 1.5 million Wi-Fi only models sold for the third generation iPad in March.

Apple's iPad mini went on sale around the world on Friday, and despite failing to attract massive queues, Apple today said it sold three million new iPads in three days

However, new figures from IDC show 
that Apple’s share of the global tablet market has fallen from 
two-thirds to a half in the past six months as Google's Android software
gains popularity.

IDC said Apple’s third-quarter share 
of worldwide tablet shipments fell from 59.7 per cent a year ago to 50.4
per cent in the three months to the end of September, while Samsung’s 
leapt from 6.5 per cent to 18.4 per cent.

The firm sold out of its initial shipment within hours online.

However, Apple stores had stock on hand on Friday when they went on sale.

'Customers around the world love the new iPad mini and fourth generation iPad,' said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO.

'We set a new launch weekend record and practically sold out of iPad minis.

'We're working hard to build more quickly to meet the incredible demand.'

The Wi-Fi + Cellular versions of both iPad mini and fourth generation iPad will ship in a few weeks in the US and in many more countries later this year.

However, new figures from IDC show that Apple’s share of the global tablet market has fallen from two-thirds to a half in the past six months as Google's Android software ains popularity.

IDC saidApple’s third-quarter share of worldwide tablet shipments fell from 59.7 per cent a year ago to 50.4 per cent in the three months to the end of September, while Samsung’s leapt from 6.5 per cent to 18.4 per cent.

Amazon captured 9 per cent of the market with its Kindle Fire products, and Asus, which manufactures Google's Nexus 7 tablet, increased its share from 3.8 per cent to 8.6 per cent globally.

Apple held 65.5 per cent of the market in the second quarter, IDC said.

Both iPad mini and the new fourth generation iPad with Retina display are available in 34 countries including the US, Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, South Korea and the UK, and will be available in many more countries later this year, including mainland China.

Demand for iPad mini exceeded the initial supply and while many of the pre-orders have been shipped to customers, some are scheduled to be shipped later this month.

The iPad mini was revealed by Apple's Phil 
Schiller at a special event in California, who said: 'You can hold it in 
one hand, this isn't a shrunken down iPad, it's an entirely new 
design'.

'iPad
mini is as thin as a pencil and as light as a pad of paper, yet packs a
fast A5 chip, FaceTime HD and 5 megapixel iSight cameras and ultrafast 
wireless―all while delivering up to 10 hours of battery life,' said 
Apple's Phil Schiller as he revealed the iPad mini.

The new gadget 
will go up against Amazon's £129 ($199) Kindle Fire and Microsoft's larger 10.6inch £399 Surface tablet, prompting experts to 
predict a 'tablet bloodbath'.

It will also compete directly with Google's £159 Nexus 7.
