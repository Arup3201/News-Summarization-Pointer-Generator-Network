Concerns: The family of retired finance executive Lee Newman are deeply concerned about the health of the 85-year-old (pictured) who is being detained in North Korea

The desperately worried wife of an 85-year-old Korean War veteran and beloved grandfather detained in North Korea has spoken out for the first time in a plea to get him home by Thanksgiving.

Merrill Newman, of Palo Alto, California, traveled to the country last month but was taken off his plane by a North Korean officer as he was about to fly back to the U.S. on October 26. 

The grandfather, who has a heart condition, hasn't been heard from since and his family are concerned about his health and status.

His wife Lee Newman, who hasn't seen her husband in six weeks, and son Jeffrey made an emotional appeal on the Today show on Monday morning.

A tearful Mrs Newman said 'It's hard for his grandchildren, it's hard for his whole family.'

Mr Newman's family has tried to to get heart medication to him through the Swedish ambassador in Pyongyang, as the
 U.S. has no diplomatic relations with North Korea.

But his deeply concerned relatives have no way of knowing if the pills have actually reached him, or had any contact at all.

'When you don't know where your husband 
of 56 years is, you don't know his health, you don't know when he will 
be home with us, it's not an easy situation. He needs to be back at 
home,' his wife said.

Merrill's son, Jeffrey Newman, believes the whole episode is a 'terrible misunderstanding.' They had only one small indication that there might have been trouble on the horizon.

'There was a conversation that took place about the Korean War and my dad's service that might have had some tension in it,' Jeffrey said.

Emotional: 'When you don't know where your husband of 56 years is, you don't know his health, you don't know when he will be home with us, it's not an easy situation. He needs to be back at home,' his wife, Lee Newman, said

Jeffrey Newman said his father was a 
constant traveler but had always wanted to visit North Korea, and took 
lessons in the language before leaving on the nine-day trip.

'This has been a lifelong dream of his,' he said.

Mr
 Newman said he believed the desire for the trip came from the three 
years his father spent as an infantry officer in the Korean war, but he 
said Merrill Newman never talked about his service.

'We have no idea that how with the guides and the visas and the paper and the itinerary that there could be anything that could've gone off track,' Lee Newman told ABC News.

As Merrill was about to fly back to the U.S. on October 26, a uniformed North Korean officer came on the plane, asked to see his passport, and then requested he be removed from the flight, his son said.

'My dad got off, walked out with the stewardess, and that's the last he was seen,' the younger Mr Newman said.

Newman went with a tour group based out of Beijing, China. His traveling companion, former Stanford University professor Bob Hamrdla, was allowed to fly out of North Korea.

Mr Hamrdla later also told ABC News that it must have been a 'terrible misunderstanding.'

'I hope that the North Koreans will see this as a humanitarian matter and allow him to return to his family as soon as possible,' he said.

The U.S. Department of State has declined to publicly confirm Mr Newman's detention, only saying that the agency has updated its travel warning for North Korea, recommending that Americans refrain from traveling to the Communist country.

'U.S. citizens crossing into North Korea, even accidentally, have been subject to arbitrary arrest and long-term detention, ' the DOS said.

Jeffrey Newman said he'd received 
postcards from his father saying the trip was going well, but on the 
last day of the tour, according to Mr Hamrdla, Merrill Newman met with 
North Korean officials and he came away with some uneasy feelings.

'We think that the conversation was difficult at times,' Mr Newman said, but did not know details.

A state 
department official told the San Jose Mercury News that the Swedish 
Embassy in Pyongyang has been acting as a go-between in matters 
concerning Americans who find themselves in trouble in North Korea.

The
 Swedish ambassador also delivered his father's heart medication to the 
North Korean Foreign Affairs Ministry, but it's unclear whether he had 
received it.

Pyongyang's secretive, authoritarian government is sensitive about foreign travelers, and tourists are closely monitored. The North has previously accused Seoul, Washington and other outsiders of working to sabotage its system -- statements that analysts see as a way to strengthen domestic support for young leader Kim Jong Un.

North Korea's official state-run media has yet to comment, and South Korean officials said they couldn't confirm media reports.

Merrill Newman has lived in a retirement complex with his wife, Lee, since 2011 in Palo Alto, where he's a big part of the alumni community at nearby Stanford University, his son said.

Jeffrey Newman said he believed North 
Korea would eventually release him after realizing that all they have is
 an 'elderly traveler, a grandfather with a heart condition.'

'We
 don't know what this misunderstanding is all about,' Jeffrey Newman 
said. 'All we want as a family is to have my father, my kids' 
grandfather, returned to California so he can be with his family for 
Thanksgiving.'

Merrill Newman is a retired finance 
executive for technology companies. Following the war, Mr Newman earned a Master's degree in education from 
Stanford University while working as a high school teacher.  

For 50 years, Newman volunteered for the American Red Cross, teaching CPR and first aid, according to San Jose Mercury News.

Since
 his retirement in 1984, Newman and his wife have become avid travelers,
 going on sailing adventures and visiting countries throughout South 
America.

According to a 
newsletter put out by their upscale senior complex, Channing House, Mr Newman took Korean 
language classes in preparation for the trip and was reportedly traveling on a 
valid visa.

Jailed: Kenneth Bae, a 45-year-old tour operator and Christian missionary, was arrested last November while leading a group of tourists in the northeastern region of Rason in North Korea and has been detained for the past year

His neighbors 
at the retirement home were bewildered by the news of his detention, one
 of them saying that Mr Newman was simply going on a 'fun' trip and had no 
ulterior motives.

The detention comes about a year after
 North Korea detained another American. North Korea has detained at 
least six other Americans since 2009.

Korean-American
 Kanneth Bae, a 44-year-old Christian missionary, has been incarcerated 
in the country for the past year despite a campaign launched by his 
family pressing for his release.

Bae was accused of planning a religious coup and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor.

Since January 2009, four U.S. citizens have been arrested for entering the country illegally, and two others who entered on valid visas were arrested on other charges.

North Korea lately has been relaxing its restrictions on U.S. tourists. Several small travel agencies have sprung up in response to the growing interest in North Korea among Westerners.

However, North Korean News reported that tour operators are often inexperienced and lack the necessary knowledge to keep their customers safe.
