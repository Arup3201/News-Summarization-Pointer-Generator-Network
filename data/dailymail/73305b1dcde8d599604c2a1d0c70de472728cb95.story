From Moroccan oils to high-tech serums, Brazilian blow dries to GHD hair straighteners, I shudder to think how much money I have spent on trying to tame my wild mane over the years.

Left to its own devices, my hair is wild, bushy and as coarse as a Brillo Pad. Only with handfuls of Kerastase anti- frizz shampoo (a snip at £13 a bottle) and lashings of super-moisturising conditioner (which comes in a gold tub and costs almost £20 a pop) does it go some way towards behaving itself.

Then comes the array of argan oils, heat-protecting sprays and serums - each costing between £7 and £20 - to try to finish the job.

Rave reviews: Marianne with the Mane'n'Tail products which promise shiny, glossy hair

Not impressed: Marianne after using her usual products, left, and after using Mane'n'Tail 

It's no wonder I'm always going over my overdraft limit - I need a big win at the horses to pay for my hair. Which is why I was so excited when I heard about the latest bargain that's now the number one bestselling hair product on Amazon.

At just £7.50 for the shampoo and the conditioner, it's said to be loved by celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, Demi Moore, Sarah Jessica Parker and Jennifer Aniston.

So, what is this wonder product? Horse shampoo. Yes, you read correctly: actual horse shampoo.

Mane'n'Tail was originally created for show ponies to keep their manes and tails shiny and glossy. The results were so good that, soon, the horses' owners started to use the products on their own hair - and then word spread.

According to the makers, their shampoo and conditioner 'have been a best-kept secret for beauty aficionados everywhere'.

The shampoo is 'fortified with moisturisers and emollients to help leave hair soft and ultra-clean', while the conditioner 'helps nourish and aid healthy hair growth, leaving hair looking lustrous and silky'.

Mixed reviews: The two products cost £7.50 but it seems you'll either love them or hate them

Together, 'these micro-enriched protein formulas help to prevent hair breakage and repair split ends, achieving the goal of longer, stronger, fuller hair . . . the results are unbelievable!'

Blimey. Can this really be true? I quickly get online to Amazon to order it and find out for myself. The next day, it arrives. The packaging is not exactly a glamorous addition to my bathroom - the big, white, plastic bottles have a picture of, well, a horse on them, which looks as though it's running into a yellow sunset. If John Wayne were to buy beauty products from Amazon, it would be this duo.

Still, I'm hopeful. Given that horses' hair is dry, frizzy and three times thicker than human hair, I figure this stuff has got to be able to whip even my mop into shape.

The shampoo is reassuringly thick and creamy, but it doesn't smell like normal shampoo. I try to put my finger on what it is like and can come up with only one thing: carpet cleaner.

No horsing around: Mane'n'Tail left Marianne's hair dry and tangled

Marianne will stick to her old shampoo, left, as the horse shampoo made her feel 'like an old nag'. Her hair is much frizzier, right, after using Mane'n'Tail 

The shampoo lathers well but, after rinsing, my hair feels much drier than it usually does. I apply lashings of the equally-thick conditioner, which looks creamy, but feels quite watery compared with my usual conditioner. My hair soaks it all up but, again, after rinsing, it feels dry and brittle.

Things take a turn for the worse when I put my mop under the hairdryer - my hair feels like straw and looks as frazzled as if I'd put my hands into an electric socket. It's become so knotted and tangled at the ends, I even struggle to get my brush through it. I haven't experienced anything like this since I was a child.

So much for show pony - I feel more like an old nag.

I can't understand the rave reviews. I did more hunting in the Amazon reader comments and found that, underneath the dozens of five-star reviews, there were a few like me, who found their hair became dry and matted after use.

This seems to be the Marmite of hair products - you either love it or hate it. One user said it took a while for her hair to get used to the products, so I persisted for a week. After two further washes, my hair did adjust slightly. It didn't feel quite so dry, and it did feel like it cleaned my scalp well. The tangles, however, remained.

So, there'll be no more horsing around for me. I will return to my usual, reassuringly expensive hair products - and maybe have a flutter on the gee-gees to help pay for them.
