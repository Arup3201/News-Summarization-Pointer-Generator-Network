A police force has admitted full liability for the injuries of a man who suffered brain damage and was left in a cell for 10 hours with no medical treatment.

Dean Hutton, 26, was hit over the head with a scaffolding pole in an attack by brothers Brett and James Garbutt in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, but was arrested and taken to a police station, where he was classified as drunk.

His head injury was not recorded by staff at Rotherham Main Street police station and it was only when he began having a fit and had blood around his mouth that he was rushed to hospital, where he was found to have ‘a serious head injury and significant brain damage’.

Before and after: South Yorkshire Police has admitted full liability for injuries suffered by Dean Hutton, who was attacked with a metal pole in the street, only to be arrested by police who thought he was drunk.

Nearly five years after the attack on August 8, 2009, Mr Hutton, from Wath-upon-Dearne, South Yorkshire, will receive financial support for his future care, which he will require for the rest of his life.

South Yorkshire Police have now admitted full liabilities for his injuries after expert evidence gathered by his solicitors showed he would have made a full recovery if he had received medical treatment for his head injury earlier.

Mr Hutton’s family has claimed the physical, cognitive and behavioural difficulties he suffers as a result of the injuries mean he ‘needs help with almost everything he does’.

The case had been due to be heard at a five-day High Court trial in March, his lawyers will now work with medical experts to gather evidence on the settlement he would need to support him for the rest of his life before negotiating over a figure with the force.

Stacey Clements, an expert serious injury lawyer at Irwin Mitchell, said: 'We are now working to secure a full settlement which will then be managed by our Court of Protection team to ensure it can provide for Dean’s lifetime needs.

'Had the police taken note of the fact that Mr Hutton had suffered a head injury and consequently recognised the symptoms he showed through the night, he would have received medical attention much sooner.'

According to a critical report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), Mr Hutton appeared well when police and paramedics were called to reports of an assault on Mount Pleasant Road in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, in August 2009.

He was arrested over a failure to appear at court and taken to custody, and although the custody sergeant was made aware he had received a head injury, no record was made of this information.

He vomited while in custody and was found to be difficult to rouse, but according to the IPCC report, his ‘actions were regarded as a result of him being drunk’ until a force medical examiner found him bleeding from his nose.

After being taken to Rotherham District Hospital, he was immediately transferred to Sheffield Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield where he underwent emergency surgery, but the damage had already been done.

Mr Hutton currently receives specialist rehabilitation and physiotherapy and needs support with daily activities such as planning his day and organising his life.

He attends Dearne Valley College three times a week for courses in Maths, English and IT and enjoys going out into the community with his support workers and going to the gym.

His father Roy said: 'Before his brain injury, Dean was completely independent but now needs help with almost everything he does.

'When we first heard about the brain injury we were so worried and we prepared for the worst. But Dean is battling back bravely and his rehabilitation has helped him come a long way.

'He is now attending college and we are just relieved that the police have admitted responsibility, meaning we don’t have to go to a full trial and that we should be able to access the care and rehabilitation Dean will need for the rest of his life.

'We are angry that Dean’s injury was not accounted for and so dealt with by police officers sooner. We are thankful to the IPCC for investigating and hope that nothing like this is allowed to happen to others again.

'Nothing can change what happened but thankfully now we can begin to move on with out lives knowing that Dean’s future will be secure.'

Brett and James Garbutt were found guilty of grevious bodily harm with intent and were sentenced to seven years and five months and five years imprisonment respectively.

A police spokeswoman said: 'South Yorkshire Police can confirm that it has accepted liability for Mr Hutton’s injuries. Our thoughts remain with Mr Hutton, his family and friends.”Our solicitors are in consultation with Mr Hutton’s legal team.'
