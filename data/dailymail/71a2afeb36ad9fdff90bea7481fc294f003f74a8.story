When you think of feminist literature, Germaine Greer's works or Sheryl Sandberg’s recent hit Lean In might spring to mind.

You may be less likely to consider a publication that’s pink all over with puppy dogs on the cover and hearts and flowers on every page.

But that’s exactly the format of the latest feminist offering, hoping to make a positive stamp on the malleable minds of our nation’s young girls.

New direction: Girl Talk has reevaluated its content after 'unsettling' survey results

Role model: Katy Perry was voted the most admired celebrity by Girl Talk readers

Girl Talk 
magazine, which is aimed at 7-10-year-olds, has re-launched with a new 
feminist ethos in response to a new poll carried out by the 
magazine to mark their 500th issue.

The
 results, which tapped into the mind-set of the magazine’s 376,000 
readers, are described by the magazine's editor Bea Appleby as 
‘unsettling, if not surprising’.

With the exception of children’s writer Jacqueline Wilson, the top 10 most admired celebrities were all singers or actors.

The latest issue of Girl Talk Magazine, which launches their #GirlsAreAmazing campaign, which carries with it an underlying editorial proimise

Sportswomen, politicians and businesswomen barely registered on the list.

 Katy Perry was voted ‘most admired celebrity’ by readers, followed by 
fellow chart regulars Taylor Swift in second place, and Jessie J in 
third position.

The
 survey also revealed an overwhelming 80 per cent of young girls 
wanted to be referred to as ‘pretty’, ‘kind’ and ‘funny’, with only 20 
per cent choosing ‘clever’, ‘strong’ or ‘brave’ as important attributes.

More
 than a third of girls aspired to jobs in showbiz and their top 10 
career choices were either artistic, performing or caring – all in roles
 traditionally thought of as feminine.

The poll prompted the magazine to reevaluate its content and launch #GirlsAreAmazing campaign, which aims to broaden ambition in young girls.

‘So much is said about the media having a bad effect on girls, so we had to really look at ourselves and make sure our influence is positive,’ Bea told MailOnline. 

‘I would like readers to feel inspired 
and confident that they really can achieve anything that they like -- 
and that they are perfectly normal if they don't feel dainty, girly and 
sweet.’

As a result, all scantily clad pop-stars are banned from their pages. Instead you’ll find a broader range of role models.

‘In
 every issue we have career profiles of women with less typically female
 jobs. So far we have had a woman pilot, a nuclear safety scientist, 
comic book artist, racing car diver and in the next issue a female 
coder,' Bea says.

‘Our
 posters have changed too - instead of just One Direction and Taylor 
Swift, we now have sportswomen and powerful characters from films and 
TV.

‘Every
 issue we have a full page profile of our hero of the fortnight - people like children’s writer Jacqueline Wilson and sportswomen Serena 
Williams and Jessica Ennis-Hill.

‘We also have stories about girls who have done amazing things, like Malala Yousafzai, and opinion pieces from readers.'

Equally important to the type of content the magazine is planning on upping is the type of content they promise to exclude.

The mantra, which appears on the first page of every issue, reads:

‘We don't talk about boyfriends, sex, puberty or anything inappropriate for our age group. 

‘Our core readers are 9-10 years old, so we have to be really careful that our editorial is just right for them,’ says Bea.

‘You
 won't find anyone who is unsuitable for our age group in Girl Talk, so 
that's Miley Cyrus, Rihanna and Robin Thicke don't feature at all.

‘And they aren't really aiming their products at our readers either.
 Pretty much anyone who persistently rolls around in their underwear or 
sings songs with rude lyrics won't feature in the magazine.'

Girl Talk’s aim is to instil a well-balanced, healthy outlook amongst readers.

‘We
 want to encourage girls to achieve and break away from limiting and 
old-fashioned beliefs about what they can do,’ explains Bea.

‘We want to make different kinds of women visible to them; women whose success is not based on looks.

'The survey was inspired by a feeling that there was something very wrong with media for girls,’ she explains.

‘There are lots of news stories and 
statistics about the lack of good female role models, the pressure to 
look pretty, sexualised pop stars, low self-esteem, girls' narrowing 
ambitions and the fear of them growing up too quickly. 

‘We wanted to see if this was true of 
our readers and to find out more about their lives. So we asked about 
the women they admire, what worries them, careers they aspire to and 
whether they believed they could reach those goals,' she says.

Girl Talk have vowed to ban pop stars in favour of stronger role-models for their pre-teen readers

Bea said she feels confident the magazine can have a positive impact.

‘When I was a child I read magazines voraciously and they had a huge influence on me; what I wore, what I wanted to be when I grew up and what kind of girl I was,' she says.

One Girl Talk fan, Glamour editor Jo Elvin, even wrote to Bea to say her daughter has started a blog because Girl Talk suggested it.
