An ex-soldier has been handed a suspended sentence for racially aggravated threatening behaviour towards an amputee gipsy busker who bragged on national TV about 'milking the benefits system'.

Viorel Dinu, 25, told Channel 5's Gypsies on Benefits and Proud he and other Romanians had come to the UK because it was a 'soft touch' for scroungers, a court heard.

But his boasts caught up with him when former soldier Mark Hawksby, 34, recognised him from the programme after tripping over the busker's money-filled coat on a street in York.

Amputee Gipsy busker Viorel Dinu, 25, appeared on Channel 5's Gypsies on Benefits and Proud earlier this year

When he turned round he found Dinu, who has no legs, sitting on a skateboard in a shop doorway grinning all over his face, the court heard.

Hawksby recognised the busker immediately from the hour-long documentary which he had only watched the week before.

Hawksby, who pleaded not guilty, told York Magistrates' Court: 'I had a go at him about being on the programme and what he had said.

'He said he had come to Britain purposely because it was a soft touch.

'I said "You're out of order for going on this TV programme and saying you can milk the system".

'I admit I raised my voice - but after he started laughing at me.

'I'm an ex-soldier - 10 to 12 years ago. I was three years in the Army and served with the Ghurkas, Fijians and all races.

'If he had been an Englishman, Welshman or Scotsman I would have had the same feelings towards him.'

The court heard that Hawksby threw the coat into the gutter in Coney Street, York, on the morning of April 26, scattering the cash everywhere.

He then grabbed Dinu's accordion and threw it into the road, saying: 'This is English money for English people.'

A crowd quickly gathered, with many puzzled by what was happening because they had not seen the TV programme, the court heard.

The court heard that Hawksby was grabbed by a girl from a hen party and he then stormed off, yelling: 'I will see you do not busk in York again.'

Ex-soldier Mark Hawksby, 34, was found guilty of racially aggravated threatening behaviour

Dinu, who travels the country telling people he lost his legs as a child when he was run over by a train, did not report the incident and did not co-operate with police who investigated after complaints from the public. 

The incident would never have come to police attention if pensioner Maurice Vassie had not reported the matter and a university professor had not taken pictures.

Mr Vassie overheard Hawksby telling the busker: 'Go back where you come from.'

Mr Vassie said: 'It could have been Doncaster for all I knew - but it was clearly xenophobic. I was shocked.'   

Professor Nick Brown, of the science and technology department at York University, took the photos which led to the ex-soldier's arrest.

He said: 'The busker was being told to go back home because he was not from Britain.

'What I was witnessing was almost certainly a racially motivated attack.'

After his arrest, Hawksby told officers: 'I told him "I couldn't go to Romania and do what you do". He is milking the system and it winds me up.

'He is not even from York. It costs £23 to £25 on the train so he must be earning some right money busking.'

Neal Kutte, defending, said: 'It was a chance meeting. He had seen this programme which was glorifying milking the system.

'He was annoyed this man was claiming money when he should not have been. It was nothing to do with his nationality.'

But prosecutor Neil Holdsworth argued: 'The target of the abuse was a foreign national and therefore it's a racial incident.'

Hawksby, of St Mary's Close, Wigginton, denied racially aggravated threatening behaviour but was found guilty.

He was given a four-month suspended jail sentence and ordered to pay £100 costs and an £80 victim surcharge.

Dinu was given an ASBO which banned him from Westminster in 2012 after making a strange screeching sound while 'performing'. 

He also has previous convictions for begging outside Selfridges and Gap on Oxford Street, a court heard at the time.
