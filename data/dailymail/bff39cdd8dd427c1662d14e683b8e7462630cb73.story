Victim: Pauline Smith, described in court as a 'lovely person' was allegedly murdered for only making beans on toast for her partner's dinner

A jealous lover strangled his mistress after a row over his dinner of beans on toast, a court heard.

Mother-of-two Pauline Smith, 54, was allegedly murdered at her flat in St Ives, Cambs, by John Mearns, the man she left her husband for.

Cambridge Crown Court heard the 54-year-old defendant had become 'possessive, jealous and controlling' when Mrs Smith had tried to return to her family.

In a recording of a 999 call played to the jury, Mearns told an operator the morning after Mrs Smith’s death last October that she was supposed to have cooked him dinner, but 'all I got was beans on toast'.

He continued: 'I hope she’s not dead. She was really nasty towards me.

'I just don’t know why she was like that. I think she has got a split personality.

'I tried to stop her sticking the knife in me and I don’t know, I must have, I must have. I tried. I obviously tried to get her to stop trying to stab me.'

Mrs Smith had moved out of her family home in Somersham, Cambs, in the spring of last year after one of her children discovered a text on her phone that revealed her affair with Mearns.

In the days before her death she had started to tell Mearns, of no fixed address, she wanted to return to her husband.

The court was told Mearns became violent because he feared their 'on-off relationship' was over.

Allan Mainds, prosecuting, told Cambridge Crown Court how Mearns flew into a rage on October 26 at Mrs Smith's flat and pushed down so hard on her throat that it fractured her voicebox and caused bleeding around her eyes.

Mr Mainds told the court Mearns was a self-obsessed liar who changed his story as he 'struggled to establish a defence for himself'.

The defendant originally claimed he was protecting himself against Mrs Smith, who he said was 'lashing out' at him, the court heard.

He then told police he did not mean to kill her or cause grievous bodily harm during the attack.

The prosecution also told the court the defendant had originally claimed he was stabbed by Mrs Smith but later admitted wounding himself with the knife.

In a statement to the court, a friend of the victim paid tribute to the mum-of two saying: 'She was a lovely person.

'She was kind, never had a bad word to say and always wanted to see the best in everyone.'

Mearns denies murder but has admitted manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility.He is arguing he was suffering from mental issues at the time of the attack.

In a statement to the court, a friend of Mrs Smith said: 'She was a lovely person.

'She was kind, never had a bad word to say and always wanted to see the best in everyone.'

The trial, which is expected to last for three weeks, continues.
