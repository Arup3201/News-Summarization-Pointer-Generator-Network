Team news

James McArthur has pulled out of the clash with the Republic of Ireland through injury.

Scotland are also without injured Aston Villa right-back Alan Hutton, and Phil Bardsley, who was forced off for Stoke during their 2-1 win at Tottenham last Sunday.

Steven Whittaker could now start at right-back in their absence, while 20-year-old Hearts defender Callum Paterson has been called up for the first time.

Scotland squad: Gilks, Gordon, Marshall, Berra, Forsyth, Greer, Hanley, R Martin, Paterson, Robertson, Whittaker, Anya, Bannan, Brown, Burke, Dorrans, D Fletcher, Macleod, Maloney, Morrison, Mulgrew, S Fletcher, C Martin, May, Naismith, Russell

Republic of Ireland 

Midfield pair James McCarthy and Glenn Whelan have been ruled out for Republic of Ireland. 

Whelan had been a shock inclusion in O'Neill's squad as he is yet to completely recover from fractured leg he suffered last month against Germany.

Defender Marc Wilson is also unavailable through injury, and could be replaced in central defence by Derby County's Richard Keogh.

Republic of Ireland squad: Given, Forde, Elliot, Randolph, O'Shea, Ward, Coleman, Clark, Keogh, Pearce, Christie, McGeady, McClean, Gibson, Meyler, Quinn, Brady, Hendrick, Pilkington, Keane, Long, Walters, Murphy, Stokes, McGoldrick
