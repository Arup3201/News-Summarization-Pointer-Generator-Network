A mother has told of her torment after finding out the man who tortured her baby to death is living just a stone's throw from her in a small village.

Evil Scott Harman, 30, was released having served just four and a half years of a seven year sentence for brutally killing his eight-month-old daughter Jessica.

But the parole conditions which barred him from living near to his ex-wife Nicola, 30, have expired enabling him to return.

Torment: Evil: Scott Harman, 30, left, served just four and a half years for killing his eight-month-old daughter but is now living near his tormented ex-wife Nicola Harman, on the left on the right hand picture, in a tiny village

Care assistant Nicola told a friend, according told the Sun: 'She can't believe it - and is terrified every time she goes out in case she sees him.

'It's pure torment - after she has just started to put the tragedy behind her and move on with her life.'

In 2008, a jury at Lewes Crown Court convicted Harman of manslaughter and child cruelty - charges which he consistently denied - after a month-long trial.

Jailing him for seven years, Judge Richard Brown said: 'The jury have, in my view, convicted you on the clearest evidence of unlawfully killing your baby daughter.

'She was eight months old. She required the most careful attention and care. Instead of giving her care, you viciously assaulted her on several occasions using extreme force to fracture her ribs. On the final occasion, you shook her or possibly flung her on to the bed.

'All these actions were no doubt done by you in a moment of uncontrolled temper.'

Harman, of Horam, near Heathfield, showed no emotion as the verdict was announced.

The dead child's mother, Nicola was not in court to see her former husband jailed.

After sentencing, police read a statement written by Mrs Harman.

It said: 'My beautiful tiny baby girl weighed just 3lbs 13ozs when she was born on August 8 2003. Sadly, on April 1 2004, aged just eight months, she was so cruelly taken from me.

'Four hard years have gone by and now at last I can finally say "May you rest in peace".

'I hope my family and I can live our lives the way we should.

'I can still picture Jessica's lovely little face with her big blue eyes looking at me, and she was always dressed in pink.

'Jessica, you will always be with me, in my memories which will never fade and forever in my heart.'

During the trial the court heard Jessica was alone with her father when she stopped breathing.

He
was changing her in an upstairs bedroom at the family home in Horam, 
near Heathfield, after returning home from a day's work in an air 
conditioning factory at Hailsham.

His wife was downstairs eating her supper when she heard her husband shout out that something was wrong with their daughter.

Despite
desperate attempts to resuscitate her, Jessica was pronounced dead 
later that evening at Eastbourne District General Hospital.

But after she died a post mortem revealed she had a severe head injury and 15 fractures of her ribs. The rib injuries had been caused on at least three separate occasions in the weeks leading up to her death.

Both parents were arrested within days of her death on suspicion of cruelty but police inquiries against them were dropped.

The post-mortem examination concluded the cause of death was unascertained. At an inquest in February 2006, after hearing the medical evidence the coroner asked for a further police investigation. Harman was charged in July that year.

In court Harman told the jury he loved his daughter and had been the happiest man alive when she was born.
