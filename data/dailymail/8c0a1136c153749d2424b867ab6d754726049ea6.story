Hundreds of mourners have paid tribute to teenager Georgia Williams, whose body was discovered in woodland after she went missing from her home.

Family, friends and teachers attending the funeral of the 17-year-old have paid tribute to the 'bright and caring' young woman they knew.

About 800 mourners turned out for a church service celebrating the life of Georgia Williams in her home town of Wellington, Shropshire, today.

Georgia Williams mother and father Lynette and Steven, and her sister Scarlett, asked people to wear bright colours at the funeral service for their daughter

Georgia left her parents' house on May 26, telling them she was going to see friends - and they never saw her alive again.

The teenager's body was discovered in woodland near Wrexham, North Wales, a few days later.

Rev Mark Ireland, vicar of All Saints' Church in Wellington, addressed mourners saying: 'We come not so much to mourn a death, but to celebrate a life.'

Her family had asked people attending the
funeral to wear bright colours, reflecting Georgia's personality and 
the spirit of the service, with many following that advice.

Among the mourners were the Chief 
Constable of West Mercia Police David Shaw, and other senior officers 
from the force where Georgia's father Steven is a serving detective.

Georgia's headteacher, Chay Davies called on people 'to take inspiration' from the cadet, who was always 'willing to muck in'

Cadets formed a guard of honour for the funeral cortege and throughout the service in a special tribute

The teenager's commanding officer Flight Lieutenant Philippa Bartlett described Georgia as 'a genuine person, brilliant and caring but most of all a bubbly character'

Chay Davies, her head teacher at Ercall Wood Technology College - where she was head girl - said 'her genuine willingness to help people shone through' when she was interviewed for the position.

He said she could always be relied on to get involved and told how at a charity drag day she pulled off a 'very convincing swagger' while walking along the catwalk, sporting 'a painted-on beard' and 'loving every minute', drawing laughter from the mourners.

Mr Davies called on people 'to take inspiration from Georgia' and be judged not by their wealth or possessions but 'by the quality of the relationships we have with the people around us'.

'Today, our whole community shows how valued Georgia is.'

Her teacher Mary Parry-Sargeant recalled Georgia was not afraid to muck in and 'was equally happy drilling holes as making the tea'.

Mourners were told to make sure Georgia's life made a lasting different to people in the town

The funeral followed the birth of a charity in Georgia's name, which will help support young people and organisations that were significant to her

Friends gathered to say goodbye to the popular former head girl, whose disappearance sparked a massive search by police

'She had excellent people skills, and understood how to appreciate people,' she added.

She said that a two-seater aeroplane students at the college are building, as part of a programme backed by aircraft-maker Boeing and the Royal Aeronautical Society, would be named The Georgia.

'Every time it flies a part of her will take to the skies,' said Mrs Parry-Sargeant.

Georgia was as busy outside school as she was in lessons, and helped out on match days at AFC Telford United as well as being a cadet corporal with 1130 Squadron, Air Cadets.

Her commanding officer Flight 
Lieutenant Philippa Bartlett described Georgia as 'a genuine person, 
brilliant and caring but most of all a bubbly character'.

She recalled how Georgia, representing the cadets in competition at swimming, had 'done her make-up' before taking to the pool.

The vicar at the service told the mourners: 'in years to come people will remember Georgia's death as a turning point, when Wellington rediscovered its soul'

The order of the service thanked all of those who had supported the family through the devastating events of the last few weeks

Flt Lt Bartlett added that Georgia would always advised colleagues who were feeling low or miserable to get 'a can of 'Man-Up, Princess'', drawing mirth from the gathered mourners.

Mr Ireland later directly addressed Georgia's family - mother Lynette, father Steven and big sister Scarlett - saying: 'You are not alone in bearing this loss.'

He added: 'We haven't lost what you have lost, but we can stand with you and we will continue to do so.'

He closed his address by asking people to make sure Georgia's life made a lasting different to people in the town.

He said that if they did so 'in years to come people will remember Georgia's death as a turning point, when Wellington rediscovered its soul'.

His words came following the creation earlier this week of the Georgia Williams Trust, a charity which will help support young people and organisations that were significant to her.

As the service ended, Georgia's father helped to bear the coffin, made of wicker, to the waiting hearse and away to a private cremation service flanked by police outriders on motorcycles.

Jamie Reynolds, 22, of Wellington, has been charged with her murder. He is in custody and will next appear at Stafford Crown Court on September 6.
