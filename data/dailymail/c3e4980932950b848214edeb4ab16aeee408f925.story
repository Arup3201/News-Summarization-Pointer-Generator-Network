An Australian Christian Democratic Party Senator has made an embarrassing error after uploading a picture he believed to be the execution of an innocent Iraqi Christian when it was in fact a convicted Iranian murderer.

Reverend Fred Nile tweeted the images in support of the campaign 'God protect the Christians of the Middle East...because our governments have failed them' on Monday.

The photos showed a young man smiling as he was led to the gallows before the stand beneath him was kicked away.

While Senator Nile has since deleted his tweet about the execution and later acknowledged his mistake

'How one Christian faced death at the hands of ISIS,' Rev Nile wrote on Twitter.

'He was already in Jesus' arms. Psalms 23:4 #saved.'

But the pictured man wasn't what Rev Nile claimed him to be.

Majid Kavoosifar was a murderous Iranian who, along with his cousin and uncle, was executed for killing a prominent Iranian judge in 2007.

Daily Mail reported the execution seven years ago, when the unrepentant and smirking 28-year-old was led to the gallows and even manged a small wave to the crowd before his death.

Flanked by masked hangmen, hoods over the heads of the condemned men were removed before the hanging, which took place in front of a giant portrait of the judge they had killed.

While Senator Nile has since deleted his tweet, he acknowledged his mistake by posting: 'I'm not infallible...but please also report on the very REAL atrocities occurring in Iraq'.
