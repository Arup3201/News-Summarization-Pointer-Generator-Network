Australia are desperately seeking a new coach for their European tour following Ewen McKenzie’s shock resignation on Saturday.

The Wallabies are due to fly north on Friday but their preparations were plunged into crisis as McKenzie abruptly ended his turbulent reign by quitting shortly after Australia succumbed to an agonising 29-28 defeat by New Zealand in Brisbane.

His position had appeared untenable as the Australian RU were thought to have begun discreetly sounding out potential replacements for the former Queensland Reds coach, who took over last summer.

Australia were leading the All Blacks 28-22 with seconds remaining before Malakai Fekitoa's late try 

Kurtley Beale has been at the centre of several scandals in the Wallabies set-up over the past few weeks 

He had been under siege after suspending maverick back Kurtley Beale for sending offensive texts about the Wallabies’ team business manager Di Patston, who promptly resigned. McKenzie was then forced to deny having a personal relationship with Patston.

Bill Pulver, the ARU chief executive, blamed McKenzie’s departure on a media campaign against him. Australia are weeks away from games against the Barbarians, Wales, France, Ireland and England, and 11 months before the World Cup where they will be grouped with England and Wales. 

Former South Africa coach Jake White and Waratahs’ Michael Cheika are potential successors but Pulver said: ‘I don’t even know who can get on a plane on Friday.’
