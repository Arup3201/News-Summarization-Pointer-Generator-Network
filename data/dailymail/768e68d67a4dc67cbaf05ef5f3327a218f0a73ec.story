Amelie Mauresmo celebrates her 35th birthday on Saturday and so, keen to get home for that, she did not want to waste time before discussing her future together with Andy Murray.

As they chatted on Thursday, the subject of travel is bound to have come up because that is likely to be the only obstacle to the continuation of their fledgling player-coach partnership.

In the wake of his shattering quarter-final defeat to Grigor Dimitrov, Murray made clear that, in principle, he wanted them to continue.

Tough to take: Andy Murray crashed out of Wimbledon at the quarter-final stage

Slow start: Murray plans to stick with Amelie Mauresmo despite his Wimbledon exit

The intention was always that this was a long-term partnership which is having a trial period, not a trial period which might develop into something long-term.

But the dethroned champion also stated that he needs to go to Miami quickly to start preparing for   Masters level events in America next month that have now assumed more importance.

He seemed to suggest allowances could be made in future for Mauresmo’s location, but not at this moment: ‘I would say it would be more likely that I will go to Miami just because of the conditions,’ he said.

‘I am not against changing or going to train in different places but I think for this period, just because of conditions in Cincinnati and at the US Open, Miami is a good place to prepare for that. But at other times of the year there is no reason why I couldn’t go somewhere else.’  

Time to regroup: Murray heads to the US next for the hard court season

Mauresmo wants to keep her travelling to a minimum, so it could be she would not hook up with him until before his next scheduled event, the Canadian Open in Toronto which starts on August 4.

There have been several years in the past — the last two for example — when Murray has turned up in Canada and Cincinnati and treated them like glorified training weeks.

He acknowledged this needs to change if he is to alter the pattern that has developed of him playing well in Grand Slams before turning in a performance of surprising ineptitude in the quarter or semi-finals.

‘It’s been a year since I won an event and the best way to prepare for majors is by winning a lot of matches and I have not done that. In Doha (in January) I didn’t do that, I didn’t do that before the French, I didn’t win Queen’s.

‘It hasn’t stopped me from having good 
runs in the Slams but to have great ones it helps if you have a good 
build-up. I lost to Roger in Australia and Rafa in Paris. I felt I was 
playing good tennis for 10 days, moving well, my game was in good shape.

Work to do: Mauresmo must hit the practice courts to address Murray's slide

Sinking feeling: Murray has not won an event for a year

'Then I just had a poor day. I don’t want to over-analyse but I know if I make some improvements, when you have those off-days you can still find a way to win.’

The statistics back up his own assertion that he has not improved since last Wimbledon. Once the tournament was over last year he was world No 2 and had earned 5,160 ranking points from the start of 2013, winning four titles. This year he has no titles and amassed only 2,290 points.

His new ranking of No 10, to be announced on Monday, is falsely depressed by missing the last two months of the season and will likely pick up soon enough, but it shows how far he has left to climb back to the elite group, which is reshuffling itself.

Downward spiral: Murray will slip to tenth in the rankings when they are announced on Monday

‘I need to go away for a few days, think about a few things, talk to my team about how I’m going to get better,’ he said. ‘If you get too down about things you waste time and the US Open will come round pretty quickly.

‘I need to make sure that when I get back on the practice court my head is clear and I have a clear plan for the next five weeks before I start playing matches again.’

Assuming he and Mauresmo continue, there are two things they must address: his second serve and his mindset going into big matches.

With Ivan Lendl, the second serve was shored up to the point where even Novak Djokovic could not properly attack it in the Wimbledon final.

Problem area: Mauresmo needs to work on Murray's second serve

1) Rafael Nadal - 12,670 pts

2) Novak Djokovic - 11,850

Finalist: 12,330 Winner: 13,130            

(Will become world No 1 if he wins Wimbledon)

3) Stan Wawrinka - 5,770

4) Roger Federer - 5,620

Finalist: 6,100 Winner: 6,900                

(Will become world No 3 if he reaches final)

5) Tomas Berdych - 4,410

6) Milos Raonic - 3,920

Finalist: 4,400 Winner: 5,200                

(Will become world No 5 if he wins Wimbledon)

7) David Ferrer - 3,875

8) Juan Martin Del Porto - 3,360 

9) Grigor Dimitrov - 3,270

Finalist: 3,750 Winner: 4,550         

(Will become world No 8 if he reaches final, world No 5 if he wins Wimbledon)

10) Andy Murray - 3,040

Too often recently it has been wafted in at sub-80mph, and someone of Dimitrov’s quality made him pay. It also appeared that he went into the match assuming or hoping the Bulgarian would not play well, despite him having just won at Queen’s Club.

Murray retreated towards his counter-punching ways rather than going forward and seizing the initiative. It was a bit like his surprise 2009 semi-final loss to Andy Roddick.

Lendl managed to get him to ignore his natural defensive instincts and be more positive, Mauresmo was unable to coax him into that on this one occasion and needs to pull off the trick in future.

As BBC 
commentator Tim Henman pointed out on Thursday: ‘I think Amelie should 
be given her opportunity but Lendl had a huge impact.

'It
 wasn’t necessarily about teaching him new shots but really focusing on 
the game style and having someone in his corner with the experience and 
the knowledge to say: “You’re doing the right thing.”

‘And the fact that he’s not there any more, I think is a loss, but let’s see what happens with Mauresmo.’
