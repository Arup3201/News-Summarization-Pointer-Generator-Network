It is said to be one of the world’s most revered paintings.

Unfortunately, visitors hoping to see Hans von Marees’ Die Labung masterpiece in Germany’s Wiesbaden Museum will be a little disappointed.

The picture, once among thousands of artworks looted and acquired illegitimately by the Nazis, is currently hanging back-to-front, with art-lovers only able to see the back of the picture’s antique frame.

Germany's Wiesbaden Museum are currently trying to raise part of the £230,000 fee to buy Hans von Marees Die Labung painting. They will only exhibit the work once the paintings rightful owners have been paid for the artwork, which was acquired by the Nazis just before World War II

It is part of a bizarre campaign by the museum to try and raise the £230,000 needed to buy the picture from the heir of its last legal owner.

The painting, which was created by German artist von Marees between 1879 and 1880, had initially belonged to the Jewish industrialist Max Silberberg.

Von Marees was known for his portraits, but Die Labung - translated as 'The Refreshment' - is one of his later mythological paintings. It measures just 64 x 85cm. 

Mr Silberberg was forced to sell the artwork, along with the rest of his valuable collection, at auction in Berlin in 1934, under pressure from the Nazis.

Both Mr Silberberg and his wife were later both murdered at Auschwitz.

The painting is believed to have spent decades in the possession of the Wiesbaden family, who bequeathed it to the museum in 1980.

However, the rightful owners have now been traced to a foundation in Israel, the Gerta Silberberg Discretionary Trust.

Alexander Klar, director of the Wiesbaden Museum, now hopes that the museum can collect €93,000 (£73,000) in donations to contribute one third of the cost towards the purchase of the artwork.

The cultural foundation of the state Hessen and the Association of Benefactors of Wiesbaden Museum have agreed to contribute the remaining funds. 

They are trying to raise the money before a November 5 deadline.

A spokesperson from the Wiesbaden Museum said: ‘The painting has been in storage and has not been seen since the 1980s.

‘We agreed on a price, but it doesn't yet belong to us, and so we won’t show it until it legally does.’

Creative agency Q came up with the idea for the campaign, which it has called ‘Wiesbaden creates the Turn!’

Q spokesman Thilo von Debschnitz explained that the campaign is seeking to not only acquire the painting, but to also raise awareness about the restitution work that art institutions in Germany are doing and are seeking to draw attention to how many ill-gotten artworks are still stored in German museums.

It was during the reign of the Third Reich in Germany that Nazi leader Adolf Hitler ordered the theft of art in Germany and across Europe for a proposed Führermuseum in Linz, Austria.

Towards the end of the WWII, soldiers began stumbling upon treasure troves of stolen art, including this one in a salt mine at Merkers, Germany, which is being inspected by American General Dwight D Eisenhower

Many of the works, hidden across Europe, are still missing. Last year £1bn worth of art was found in the apartment of German Cornelius Gurlitt

Monuments Men, written and directed by Hollywood star George Clooney and starring Matt Damon and Cate Blanchett, tells the story of the recovery of stolen paintings which had been plundered by the Nazis during WWII

Attempts to prevent the destruction of the stolen artefacts and plundered paintings following the end of World War II was undertaken by a group of around 300 officers from the Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program.

The MFAA involved around men and women from 17 nations. It was led by the Americans, but Britain provided the second-largest group of volunteers.

The story was turned into a film called Monuments Men, written and directed by Hollywood star George Clooney and starring Matt Damon, Bill Murray, John Goodman, Hugh Bonneville and Cate Blanchett. 

The Wiesbaden Museum has already twice images returned or bought images from their rightful heirs.

Thilo von Debschnitz said: ‘We want to right not only the image, but also a wrong.’
