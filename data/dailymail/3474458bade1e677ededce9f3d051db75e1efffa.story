The father of a man suspected in the death of a Florida woman missing since September 2012 may have sealed his son's fate by unintentionally pointing police to her body.

The elderly man admitted Monday to police he picked up son Jesus Maqueira from a gas station not far from the elementary school Raquel Calderin, 42, worked at the night she disappeared - shattering the suspected killer's alibi and handing them the evidence they needed to prove his involvement.

Searchers then found her blue Ford Expedition submerged in a canal not far away. Maqueira, Calderin's estranged husband, had long-been suspected in her death, but the lack of a body made his trial set to begin next month an uphill climb.

Guilty conscience?: Father Felix Maqueira confessed Monday to picking up son Jesus Maqueira at a gas station not far from where the woman's body was found submerged in a canal later that afternoon - she had been missin since 2012

Investigators uncovered toll records for Felix Maqueira, 81, that showed his car had been on the Florida Turnpike that night, according to the Miami Herald.

The elder Maqueira had previously insisted he never left home that night and that he had no reason to lie.

He first tried to cover for his son after the records were shown to him by saying he had been for a ride with his wife, but soon came clean.

'I’m going to tell you something — something you want to know,' the octogenarian told detectives.

He admitted to meeting his son after receiving a call from him claiming he 'had run out of gas.'

Felix Maqueira then admitted to seeing Calderin's Expedition - the one claimed to have been on empty - drive away from the gas station at which he picked up son Jesus Maqueira - police do not believe he saw the woman alive.

The interrogator became visibly upset with the Maquiera family patriarch.

Body found: Police found an SUV belonging to Raquel Calderin, 42, who hasn't been seen since September 2012. Human remains were discovered inside the car

'You lied to me. That hurts me,' said the detective. 'I treated you like my grandfather.'

When pressed for a reason he did not question the SUV leaving, the 81-year-old said: 'I didn’t ask.'

'You know why you didn’t ask?' The officer pressed. 'Because in your heart, you know something happened and you didn’t want to know.'

The interrogation then ended. Police had no further questions for the father of the suspected killer.

Diver soon found the submerged vehicle with Calderin's remains inside.

Jesus Maqueira, 56, was originally charged with her murder in February 2013 after reportedly admitting to the murder but taunting police, saying they had no proof without a body.

Calderin and Jesus Maqueira had been married for 20 years and had three children when she filed for divorce in September of 2012.

She was a school custodian who had left her husband in July 2012 and filed for divorce and a restraining order.

According to the Miami Herald, friends of Calderin say Jesus Maqueira was a jealous and domineering husband who frequently physically and emotionally abused his wife.

In 1996 and again in 2009 Calderin sought a restraining order against her husband for domestic violence.

She repeatedly left the home for days at a time, reportedly staying in women's shelters.

She only left her husband for good after meeting another man, Dagoberto Vasquez, in a supermarket, according to reports.

Jesus Maqueira then began stalking his wife, bombarding her with phone calls and text messages such as 'die whore,' the Herald reported.

He would park his car across the street from Gloria Floyd Elementary where she worked as a custodian and stay for hours, according to criminal complaints.

On the final day Calderin was seen, Jesus Maqueira confronted her at the school with the couple's 15-year-old daughter in tow and tried to convince her to return home.

She refused and after Jesus Maqueira had left, her supervisor allowed the shaken and emotional Calderin to leave early, around 9:30pm.

Calderin phoned Vasquez, with whom she was living, as she left the school. But at 9:38pm, the call dropped out. She was never seen again.

After months of searching for Calderin, Jesus Maqueira was brought into the Miami-Dade Police Department for questioning.

Jesus Maqueira's alibi for the night Calderin disappeared quickly fell apart, and his cell phone records placed him near the elementary school that night - but still police could not pin Calderin's death on him with anything more than circumstantial evidence and his mocking confessions.

Denial: Despite allegedly confessing to police, Maqueira has since denied having anything to do with his wife's disappearance

Miami-Dade Detective Juan Segovia told the Miami Herald that Jesus Maqueira at one point told police sarcastically, 'Look, I killed her, take me to jail,' and made light of the fact that there was no physical evidence.

'Mr Maqueira laughed out loud at these investigators and stated that without a body there was very little we could do to him,’ Segovia wrote in a report of the interrogation.

According to the Miami Herald, Jesus Maqueira had made cryptic comments to friends and family that whoever had killed Calderin 'would never be found because she was probably dead in a canal.'

An inmate who had befriended Jesus Maqueira at the Metro West Detention Center who is now a witness against him told detectives that the suspected killer confessed to the murder, saying he hid in the back of Calderin's SUV and beat her to death before driving the car into the canal, reports the Miami Herald.

Jesus Maqueira's murder trial is scheduled to begin next month.
