Adam Rowland just completed an impressive five-day journey flying back and forth across the world - all to earn a coveted British Airways gold card.

The 30-year-old online marketing executive from Epping, England, travelled 29,739 km in just 120 hours, jetting from London to Honolulu to New York City and many more American cities in between.

Adam chronicled his quest for gold on his blog, reviewing each flight, lounge and airport as he went.

Adam Rowland travelled almost 30,000 kilometres in just five days on his quest for a British Airways gold card

Once Adam had completed his journey, he was given his card in a special ceremony at Heathrow's Terminal 5 

'A member of our team at British Airways spotted Adam's blog and [we followed] him as he crisscrossed the Atlantic,' said James Hiller, the Executive Club manager at British Airways. 

So, to welcome Adam home, British Airways rolled out the red carpet treatment at Heathrow's Terminal 5 to present him with his gold card in the Galleries First lounge.

Adam started his journey at London City Airport, then flying on from city to city. 

His itinerary included the following flights:

1) London City to Amsterdam

2) Amsterdam to Heathrow

3) Heathrow to Boston

4) Boston to Los Angeles

5) Los Angeles to Honolulu

6) Honolulu to Los Angeles

7) Los Angeles to Washington Dulles

8) Washington Dulles to Charlotte

9) Charlotte to New York

10) New York to London City

11) Heathrow to Amsterdam

12) Amsterdam to London City

British Airways also presented Adam with a special medal once he landed in London after his last flight

'I must say, it's a weird feeling being in [an airport] without a destination to look forward to,' Adam wrote on his blog. 'But luckily in this instance, I did have one to look forward to: Galleries First!'

'The First lounge felt like a home from home,' he continued. 

'The first thing you notice is the sense of space.'

'Even though the regular Galleries lounge is cavernous, the exclusivity of the First lounge keeps it feeling more intimate.'

Along the way Adam wrote about the meals on each flight

Adam was presented with champagne and his well-earned card from a British Airways brand ambassador.

'It's an incredible achievement and we are delighted to award him the Gold card he's achieved with his flying, and we look forward to welcoming him as a Gold customer on his next journey with us,' Hiller added.

'It was a great way to round off such a brilliant experience,' Adam concluded.  

To qualify for British Airways gold card status, customers must rack up 1,500 tier points.

Gold card membership benefits include first class lounges, travel spas, priority boarding and check-in, and discounts from partner corporations such as Mandarin Oriental and Langham Hotels.
