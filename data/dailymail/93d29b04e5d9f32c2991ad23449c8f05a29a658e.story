A 15-year-old boy fell to his death after trying to skateboard while hanging off the back of a car.

Austin Demauro was clinging on to the right rear corner of a Mercedes sedan, being driven by his friend in St Petersburg, Florida.

The pair were trying out a stunt known as 'skitching', where the skater holds onto a moving vehicle then lets go to gain extra momentum.

But at 6pm on Sunday, Demauro was trailing his friend's car on Atwood Avenue North near Fossil Park skate park when he lost balance and hit his head on the road.

Adventurous: He was clinging to the back of his friend's car to gain extra momentum skating down a road

He was pronounced dead at the scene.

Demauro and his friend were trying to film to move with a camera he got as a Christmas present. He was not wearing a helmet.

His friend, who had a learner's permit, was driving his mother's car.

Distraught, his mother Christy Randolph told ABC Action News: 'He was my only baby. He was everything to me. Everything.

'He was adventurous. He did everything, skateboarding, mud trucks.

'I just want my baby to come home. He should have come home with me, but he couldn't. All over a boy being a boy.'

His best friend Nathan Glass, who was not present at the time of the incident, told the station: 'I'm at a loss for words.

'That was the first time I ever heard of him doing something like this.'
