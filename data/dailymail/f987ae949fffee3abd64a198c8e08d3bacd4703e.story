A North Korean official has threatened to launch a nuclear attack on the U.S. after claiming tensions had been ramped up on the Korean peninsula following a series of military drills.

Hwang Pyong-So, director of the military's General Political Bureau, described the White House and the Pentagon as 'the sources of all evil' as he warned of attacking the U.S. with nuclear-armed rockets.

Speaking at a military rally in Pyongyang on Sunday - the anniversary of the armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean War - Hwang, vice marshal in the Korean People's Army, said tensions had been raised following a series of drills by the U.S. and South Korea, AFP has reported.

Hwang said: 'If the U.S. imperialists threaten our sovereignty and survival... our troops will fire our nuclear-armed rockets at the White House and the Pentagon - the sources of all evil.'

It is widely believed North Korea does not possess the military capability to launch a nuclear attack on the U.S.

It has however been testing a higher number of weapons this year than previously.

On Saturday it fired a short-range ballistic missile into waters off its east coast, a South Korean defence official said.

The missile, fired from North Korea's southwest Hwanghae province on Saturday evening, flew about 500 kilometers (310 miles) across the country before landing in the sea, the official said, according to AP.

North Korea routinely test-fires missiles, artillery and rockets, but the number of weapons tests it has conducted this year is much higher than previous years.

Outside analysts say this indicates that North Korea's young leader, Kim Jong-Un, is handling things differently than his late father, Kim Jong-Il, who used longer-range missile and nuclear tests sparingly, as negotiating cards with the outside world to win concessions.

Analysts also say Kim Jong-Un won't order troops to stop testing weapons unless rival South Korea and the U.S. make a major concession such as downsizing their regular joint military drills or conducting them in a low-key manner.

Pyongyang calls the drills by Seoul and Washington a rehearsal for invasion, though the allies say they have no intention of attacking North Korea.

Annual summertime exercises by South Korean and U.S. troops are slated for next month.

Despite its continuing weapons tests, North Korea also has sent mixed signals by proposing measures that it says would lower tensions with the South, such as halting mutual slandering.

South Korean officials have rebuffed the North's overture, arguing that the North must first demonstrate how serious it is about nuclear disarmament.

North Korea is seen by foreign observers as pushing for better ties with South Korea and other countries as a way to lure international investment and aid to revive the country's stagnant economy.

The Korean Peninsula remains in a technical state of war because the July 27, 1953, armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean War has yet to be replaced by a peace treaty.

The U.S. has about 28,500 troops in South Korea to deter potential aggression from the North.
