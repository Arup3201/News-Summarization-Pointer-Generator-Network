Suspect: Police in Virginia were called to a wooded area in York County at 12:45 p.m. Monday and discovered Stephanie Griffith, pictured, with a 15-year-old girl

A Virginia woman, who told police she was a 15-year-old boy, has been charged with sexual battery and crimes against nature after she was caught in the woods with a 15-year-old girl.

York-Poquoson Sheriff's deputies were called to the wooded area along Point Comfort Loop in York County at around 12:45 p.m. Monday after receiving a report of a person screaming.

There they found the 15-year-old girl, who hasn't been named, and the suspect, who identified herself as a 15-year-old boy named Seth Walker.

Deputies quickly determined Walker was in fact not a boy but a 21-year-old female called Stephanie Griffith.

'It was also determined that Griffith had been having consensual sexual contact with the 15-year-old female in the woods and on several other occasions,' York-Poquoson Sheriff's Office Lt. Dennis Ivey, Jr. wrote in a statement.

Ivey told WAVY.com the victim knew Griffith was a woman though it's unknown if the victim knew Griffith's age.

The scream was in fact a result on an attempted piercing that was consensual, Sheriff Danny Diggs told WTKR.com. He said Griffiths had been trying to pierce the girl's belly button.

'There's some twists and turns to this story at the very least,' Diggs said.

According to Diggs, the pair became friends a few months ago and over time their relationship became sexual.

Griffith appears with a short cropped haircut in her police mugshot, wearing what looks like a fleece sweater.

She is charged with seven counts of sexual battery, one count of crimes against nature and one count of piercing a minor.

Investigators are interested to know if Griffith, aka Seth Walker, has victimized any other juveniles.

'We think there's a good possibility that she could have ensnared some other young people,' Sheriff Diggs told WTKR.com.
