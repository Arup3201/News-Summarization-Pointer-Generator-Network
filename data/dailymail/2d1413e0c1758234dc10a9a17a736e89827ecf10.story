With long flights, late nights and constant pressure to look good, the jet set lifestyle can wreak havoc on even the glossiest of A-listers.

But Hollywood's finest have a new weapon in their anti-ageing arsenal: a smorgasbord of pills and supplements that they swear make all the difference.

These are not the sort of supplements you will see lining the shelves at Tesco. From stomach calming probiotics to wrinkle-busters that fix the skin from within, the new breed of Hollywood super-supplements have some serious science to go with them.

Anti-ageing arsenal: Celebrities are increasingly turning to pills to keep wrinkles and cellulite at bay

Probiotics might have been around for a while, but the new super-strength variety are currently topping the Hollywood beauty wishlist.

'It's all about calming the digestion and flattening the stomach,' reveals LA nutritionist Kimberley Snyder who adds that demand for 'power probiotics' shoots up during awards season.

Although there's plenty of choice when it comes to probiotics, the brand that currently has cult status among A-listers is Symprove, £21.95, which comes in a liquid form and calms the stomach, while tackling bloating at the same time.

Both symptoms are caused by stress, which is why magnesium is also a popular pill among the glitterati.

'Magnesium is a great relaxer,' former supermodel Rosemary Ferguson told Grazia magazine. 'It soothes the muscles, so it's brilliant for stress, and is fantastic for sleep.

'That's why bathing in Epsom Salts is so good, as you absorb magnesium through the skin.'

Effective: Jennifer Lawrence and Lopez turned to supplements to help them survive the awards season

One A-list convert to the power of Epsom Salts is Hunger Games star, Jennifer Lawrence, who began using the remedy on the recommendation of her friend and personal trainer, Dalton Wong.

'Epsom Salts help to get rid of any bloating in the body before slipping into a red carpet dress,' Wong revealed.

'It’s a great trick that anyone can use if they’re working up to wearing a particularly clingy dress.'

Also on the shopping list is Japanese scientist Dr Miyayama's 'super conductor' supplement, Fulphyl which costs a truly A-list £160 per bottle.

Fulphyl, another liquid supplement, contains fulvic acid which helps transport nutrients and vitamins around the body, as well as an anti-oxidant in its own right.

According to nutritionists, the supplement can help maximise the effectiveness of other pills, as well as halting damage caused by wrinkle-causing free-radicals.

Wrinkles and free-radicals are also the target of French cosmetic doctor Dr Daniel Sister's Youth pills, £64 for a one-month supply.

Combining amino acids and marine enzymes, the supplement is said to boost volume while repairing and strengthening skin from within.

While Dr Sister's pills can help calm skin, nothing soothes as fast as Hungarian organic brand, Eminence Calm Skin VitaSkin Solution, £36.22.

Because the average A-lister travels almost constantly, jet lagged skin is a serious problem, which Eminence tackles with detoxifying milk thistle.

Also included are anti-oxidant green tea, garlic oil and lecithin, all of which help to get rid of lumpy, bumpy skin and rashes - essential if your job includes stepping off planes in front of paparazzi.

Not surprisingly, the all-natural, all-organic supplement has proved popular with health conscious stars, including Jessica Biel and Megan Fox - both of whom use the pills.

But though skin and sleep are key parts of keeping A-listers glossy, the perfect body is a priority, which is why supplements like Functionalab's Beauty Dose Body Toning supplement, £33, and Verdesse's green coffee slimming pills, £14.95, are so popular with stars such as Katy Perry and Jennifer Lopez.

Green coffee proved particularly popular in the run up to the Oscars, thanks to studies which show it can boost weight loss by an impressive 10 per cent.

According to a study conducted by scientists from the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania, the fat-busting impact of the pills occurs even when taken in relatively low doses.

Joe Vinson, who led the study, said: 'Based on our results, taking multiple capsules of green coffee extract a day — while eating a low-fat, healthful diet and exercising regularly — appears to be a safe, effective, inexpensive way to lose weight.'
