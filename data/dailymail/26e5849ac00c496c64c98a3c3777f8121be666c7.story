Sunderland manager Gus Poyet has agreed a deal to bring Liverpool defender Sebastian Coates  to the Stadium of Light on a season-long loan.

And as he can't sign two loan players from the same club under Premier League rules, Poyet faces a choice of taking either his Uruguayan compatriot Coates or striker Fabio Borini on a temporary arrangement.

Frustrated figures: Sebastian Coates has barely played for Liverpool since joining the club in 2011

On the move: Coates (right) is now set to join Sunderland on a season-long loan deal

Coates, 23, has started only six Premier League games in his three seasons at Anfield and manager Brendan Rodgers is happy for the central defender to go out and get first-team experience elsewhere with Liverpool being paid a loan fee.

Coates was a late substitute when Uruguay beat England in this summer's World Cup and Poyet would like him to help shore up Sunderland's defence.

Plans to bring back Borini, who played such a big part in the Black Cats' successful survival bid last season, have so far stalled in negotiations with Liverpool.

Coming back? Sunderland also want Liverpool striker Fabio Borini, who spent last season on loan with them
