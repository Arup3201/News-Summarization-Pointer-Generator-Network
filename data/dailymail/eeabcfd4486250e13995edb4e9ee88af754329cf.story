House Speaker John Boehner teared up on Tuesday as he led a ceremony to award a special band of World War II solders the Congressional Gold Medal. 

About 200 people attended the award ceremony to honor the 1st Special Force - also known as the Devil's Brigade - including about 40 remaining members of the elite group of American and Canadian soldiers.

'These men saved the free world,' Rep Boehner, R-Ohio, said at the Tuesday event where he was pictured wiping away tears from his face.

'These men saved the free world,' House Speaker Boehner said at the medal ceremony on Tuesday

The legendary special force was tasked with creating havoc behind enemy lines through sabotage and slaughter and laid the foundation for the U.S. navy SEALS and the modern day special forces in Canada. 

The troop were so feared by the Nazis that they earned the nickname the 'Devil's Brigade' because of their painted faces and stealth tactics. 

On Tuesday, Devil's Brigade veteran Eugene Guttierez Jr, of Texas, accepted the Gold Medal on behalf of his comrades, living and passed. 

'Guess what? They delivered,' he said, as he accepted the highest Congressional honor for  civilians.

Guttierez enlisted in the Army in 1941 and went on to fight with the Devil's Brigade in the coastal city of Anzio, Italy before helping liberate Rome.

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the brigade members 'heroes' who 'helped free the world of tyranny'. 

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, also weighed in to toast the brigade's special set of skills that helped secure Allied victory.

Ceremony: The event was attended by about 200 at the Congressional Visitors Center, including about 40 veterans of the 1st Special Forces 

'They advanced on skis and through the air. They survived by stealth and trained in demolitions. Some of their more daring mission plans would have made James Bond blush,' McConnell said.

'But this isn't just some Hollywood script,' he said. 'It's a true story about a fearless group of young Canadians and Americans...who were willing to put their lives on the line in the truest sense of the term. Through it all, they helped save a continent in chaos.' 

 Behind enemy lines: The First Special Service Force earned the nickname 'Black Devils' because they smeared their faces with boot polish and murdered Nazis in their sleep. Pictured: being briefed before setting out on patrol at Anzio, Italy, in 1944

They were nicknamed the 'Devils Brigade' and were feared by the Nazis because of their stealth tactics. Pictured: The unit preparing to go out on an evening patrol in Anzio, Italy, in April 1944

The Black Devils were formed in 1942 and the 1,800 strong force was primarily made up of volunteers who were previously lumberjacks, forest rangers, hunters and game wardens.

At their base in Fort Harrison near Helena, Montana in the United States, they received rigorous and intensive training in stealth tactics, hand-to-hand combat, the use of explosives for demolition, parachuting, amphibious warfare, rock-climbing, mountain warfare, and as ski troops.

They even had a specially designed fighting knife made for them called the V-42.

During the war they fought across Europe, in the Aleutian Islands,  the Pacific and later in Italy and southern France before being disbanded in December 1944.

The first operation in 1942 was codenamed 'Project Plough,' and was described as a 'suicide mission.' 

They had parachute into German-held Norway to knock out strategic targets such as hydroelectric power plants.

But it  was during Operation Shingle in Anzio, Italy, in 1944 that they earned the nickname the 'Black Devil's.

They were brought ashore to hold and raid the beachhead, which they did.

A journal of a German officer which was found by allies, read: 'The Black Devils are all around us every time we come into the line. We never hear them come.'

They were the subject of the 1968 movie, 'Devils' Brigade,' starring William Holden and Cliff Robertson and were also said to have inspire Quentin Tarantino's 2009 movie Inglorious Basterds.

After each successful raid they left a card depicting their unit patch and the phrase 'Das dicke Ende kommt noch' or 'The worst is yet to come

In total they saw only 251 days of combat but the force suffered 2,314 deaths, captured 27,000 prisoners and won five U.S. campaign stars and eight Canadian battle honors. 

The unit joins the ranks of George Washington and Nelson Mandela as recipients of the highest civilian honour the United States Congress can bestow. 

Around 175 surviving members will receive the gong to honour  their battlefield heroics and sacrifices 70 years ago.
