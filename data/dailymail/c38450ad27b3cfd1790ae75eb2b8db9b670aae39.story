Authorities say two F-16 fighter jets escorted a small airplane out of restricted airspace in Washington, an apparently inadvertent intrusion that prompted evacuations at the U.S. Capitol and surrounding buildings.

The plane - a Mooney M20C personal aircraft - entered the restricted airspace about 1:30 p.m. and was 'out of communications with air traffic controllers,' the North American Aerospace Defense Command said in a statement.

NAADC spokesman Master Sgt. Chuck Marsh says military jets escorted the plane to an airport in Mount Airy, North Carolina, where it landed Saturday afternoon.

Evacuated: The U.S. Capitol, surrounding office buildings, the Supreme Court and the Library of Congress were evacuated Sunday

Secret Service agents met the plane there and interviewed the pilot, who was with one other passenger on his was to visit his daughter in North Carolina, the Boston Globe reports.

According to the paper, the pilot was lost when he entered the restricted airspace surrounding D.C., and was likely due to the fact that he was outdated maps.

Transportation Security Administration spokesman Ross Feinstein wrote on Twitter that it appeared the pilot was just confused. The plane had departed from Westfield, Massachusetts.

U.S. Capitol Police say the Capitol and surrounding office buildings were evacuated about 1:30 p.m.

Aircraft: A MooneyM20C similar to the one pictured was the type of aircraft that entered the restricted airspace

Authorities say the Supreme Court and the Library of Congress were also evacuated, but that security at the White House was not affected.

FAA records show that the owner of the plane is Craig Hewitt, of Falls Village, Connecticut. It's unclear whether he was the man piloting the plane when it entered restricted airspace.

Authorities are yet to determine whether the pilot will face any criminal charges or civil penalties.
