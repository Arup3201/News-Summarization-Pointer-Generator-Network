Kingpin: David Smith who ran a drug trafficking gang like a 'set of marionettes' while building a £1million property protfolio has been jailed for 11 years

A secret millionaire who set up a cocaine trafficking gang which he treated like 'a set of marionettes' has been jailed for 11 years.

David Smith, 41, exploited his team of dealers and couriers while living a life of anonymity in his £120,000 suburban semi in Stockport.

As his lieutenants mixed, prepared and transported drugs, Smith was covertly building a £1million property portfolio and a stash of cash.

After building a network of safe houses, his gang did his dirty work before he picked up the profits at the end of each deal.

Police in Stockport, Greater Manchester compared him to a puppeteer who kept his team 'at his beck and call.'

He was arrested last October following a year-long police operation culminating in a series of raids at 12 different addresses in Stockport and one in North Wales.

Huge bundles of cash including one wad of £380,000 was seized from one address, a further £150,000 was seized from a second and £7,000 from a third.

Seven kilograms of cocaine with an estimated street value of £681,402 was also recovered.

Police also confiscated several cars, including a BMW X5 and a Renault Laguna.

At Minshull Street Crown Court, Manchester, Smith, from Stockport, admitted conspiracy to supply cocaine and money laundering and now faces a Proceeds of Crime Application to seize his money.

Eight of his gang, all from Stockport, were jailed for a total of 43 years.

Det Insp Steve Earnshaw, of Greater Manchester Police, said: 'Over the course of several months, we pursued these men with a dogged determination to unravel their activities and establish who the main runners and riders were.

'David Smith was clearly at the top of the tree, operating the others from above like a set of marionettes that he had at his beck and call to do his dirty work for him.

'They were dealing in large quantities of drugs and cash. The stakes that they were playing for brought them high rewards but they now realise that the consequences too are high.'

Stash smashed: These bundles of drugs were found in the extractor hood above the cooker at one of the properties raided by police last October

Illicit product: Drugs recovered after the arrest of two gang members. In total, seven kilograms of cocaine with an estimated street value of £681,402 was seized during the raids

Complex operation: The drugs would, through a network of safe houses, be packaged and delivered to street dealers and addicts through a well organised network of mobile couriers

Police said Smith was the 'key man' of
 the operation, who would source high purity cocaine in kilogram amounts
 from drug-trafficking contacts.

The
 drugs would then, through a network of safe houses, be packaged and 
delivered to street dealers and addicts through a well organised network
 of mobile couriers.

The drugs would be cut with the mixing agent Benzocaine in an effort to maximise profits.

Once
 the drugs had been mixed and prepared for sale, individual 'dealer 
packs' were provided to the street dealers who would then collect the 
money which was then given to Smith.

Large hoards of cash would be kept at safehouses and drugs would be pressed into hard blocks.

Ill-gotten gains: Huge bundles of cash including one wad of £380,000 was seized from one address, a further £150,000 was seized from a second and £7,000 from a third

Hidden hoards: huge sums of cash would be kept at safe houses and drugs pressed into hard blocks

Cataloging the evidence: Police notes written on drug stashes detailing where they were seized

Philip James, 34, and 25-year-old Dixie Dean who both mixed and prepared the drugs for sale were jailed for six and a half years and six years respectively. 

Couriers Gary Cantwell, 51, and Craig Ryder, 28, and street dealer Scott Whelan, 28, were each jailed for six a half years.

Fellow dealers Chris Clayton, 28, and Keiran Murray, 26, were jailed for four years and four and a half years respectively.

Trevor Whitehead, 52, who ran a safe house was jailed for three years. All eight men admitted conspiracy.

Det Insp Earnshaw added: 'Dealing drugs in any quantity carries significant risks if caught, but when we look at the size of this operation it is only right that the sentences reflect what was a million pound enterprise.

Lieutenants: Philip James (left), 34, and 25-year-old Dixie Dean (right) who both mixed and prepared the drugs for sale were jailed for six-and-a-half years and six years respectively

Dealers: Chris Clayton (left), 28, and Keiran Murray (right), 26, were jailed for four and four-and-a-half years

'Puppets': Street dealer Scott Whelan (left), 28, was jailed for six-and-a-half years, while Trevor Whitehead (right), 52, who ran a safe house was sentenced to three years

'I must reserve special credit for the investigating officers who presented such overwhelming evidence for what was an extremely complex investigation that all nine men had no other option but to admit their guilt.

'Now the criminal process is over we will be using the laws available to us to strip Smith of any and all the assets accumulated from his illegal endeavours.

'Cocaine abuse, like other drug abuse, is a major factor in a lot other acquisitive crime such as theft, burglary and robbery, which people turn to in order to feed their habits.

'It is also a factor in violent crime, fuels gang violence and organised crime and in real terms can and does impact on the day to day lives of local residents.

'Smith and people of his ilk are not bothered about this. They are not bothered about the effect the drug has on individuals, the effect it has on the community at large or the victims of crime the abuse leads too.

'Their only focus is money and affording the kind of lifestyle many only dream about.

'By removing groups like Smith's, and by using POCA legislation, we are helping prevent the supply of drugs.'
