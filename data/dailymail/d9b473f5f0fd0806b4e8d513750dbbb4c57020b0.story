Two more men have been arrested in connection with the Holly Bobo case, the Tennessee nursing student - and cousin of country singer Whitney Duncan - who went missing on the morning of April 2011.

Jeffrey Pearcy and Mark Pearcy have both been charged with accessory after the fact and tampering with evidence.

The brothers were arrested on May 29 and both men are expected in court on Wednesday morning for their arraignments.

According to the affidavit for Jeffery Pearcy, investigators believe he has 'shown a visual recording on an electronic device to an individual.

'According to the witness, this visual recording shows information that will prove to be beneficial in the prosecution of a current on-going investigation being conducted by the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.'

The affidavit doesn’t mention if the charges are in relation to the Bobo case, reports the Jacksonsun.com.

Investigators believe that Jeffrey Pearcy has possession or has knowledge of where the video is, according to the affidavit.

The affidavit states that Jeffrey Pearcy is an 'accessory after the fact due to his conduct concerning the concealment of evidence into the investigation.'

Tampering with evidence is a Class C Felony and accessory after the fact is a Class E Felony.

Suspect: Jason Wayne Autry has been charged with the kidnap and murder of Holly Bobo

Loss: Nursing student Holly Bobo was seen being led from her Tennessee home in April 2011

Threats: Adams appears in court earlier this year over claims he threatened his brother, who is a witness in the case

A
 TBI spokesperson said in a statement, ‘…out of respect for the judicial
 process, we cannot speak to the particular possible pieces of evidence 
in this case. We continue our work to follow the leads wherever they 
might lead. We won’t stop until we find a sense of justice and closure 
for the family and friends of Holly Bobo.’

Jeffrey Pearcy, 42, is currently being held in Henderson County without bond.

Mark Pearcy was transferred from Decatur County to Carroll County last week and is also being held without bond.

He was 
also charged with failing to register as a sex offender and unlawful 
possession of a weapon. According to online records, Mark Pearcy registered as a sex offender in 2000 for statutory rape.

The arrests are the latest development since Jason Wayne Autry became the second man to be charged with the murder and kidnapping of the missing student, who was last seen by her brother being led into woods at their home.

Connection: Autry, who is currently serving a three-year sentence for aggravated assault, is described as a long-time friend of Adams

Autry, 39, is a longtime friend of Zachary Adams, who was also charged with her kidnap and murder in March.

Tennesse Bureau of Investigation director Mark Gwyn said they have sworn statements from witnesses who claim to have seen Miss Bobo alive with Autry and Adams after she had been reported missing.

He added that they also had physical evidence being analyzed at two crime laboratories, and several witnesses.

'We believe other individuals have knowledge, and possibly others have involvement,' Mr Gwyn told News Channel 5. 'They can expect us to be on their doorsteps very soon.'

He added: 'This is a case the TBI has been continuously working hard to solve now for three years. It has not been easy but I do know truth will prevail.'

'Anyone who had anything to do with Holly's disappearance will be brought to justice,' he added.

The first major break in the case came in February, when the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation agents and FBI searched several areas around Decatur, including the home of Zachary Adams.

Adams, 29, was arrested and charged with kidnapping and murder shortly afterwards.

Miss Bobo's body has never been found.

Adams appeared in court in April on charges of coercion of a witness after allegedly making threats to his brother who is due to testify against him.

Adams' brother allegedly told the FBI he had seen Miss Bobo, 20, alive at his home after she was reported missing.

Adams is accused of asking a fellow inmate to tell his brother: 'He's the one who started this s*** and if he don't shut his mouth he will be in the hole beside her,' CBS News reported.

Autry, 39, has been indicted with especially aggravated kidnapping and first-degree felony murder.

He is already in prison serving a three-year sentence for aggravated assault. 

The case about Miss Bobo's disappearance is still active. Prosecutors are considering seeking the death penalty if they get a conviction in the case.
