Arsenal have been dealt a severe blow with the news that Mesut Ozil will be missing for the remainder of 2014.

The midfielder went for an MRI scan on a niggling knee problem and the German FA confirmed that he will be out for three months.

The 25-year-old didn't train with Germany in Frankfurt after growing concerns over the complaint.

Ozil has shown no major sign of injury in recent months and has played nine times this season, scoring once.

'@MesutOzil1088 out for 10-12 weeks with partial lateral collateral ligament tear in left knee. More to follow... Get well soon!' the German FA tweeted. 

A slightly contradictory Arsenal statement read: 'Ozil complained of a sore left knee after the game and the club advised the German FA to run medical checks when he joined up with his international squad.

'The club will make further assessments and it is too early to say how long Ozil may be out of action'.

Ozil, signed for £42.5million last year, had drawn criticism for a number of below-par performances in an Arsenal shirt. 

Nevertheless, the news serves to intensify Arsene Wenger's growing injury trouble just two months into the new season. 

Aaron Ramsey, Mathieu Debuchy and Olivier Giroud are all long term absentees, while Mikel Arteta is also nursing a knock.

The lateral collateral ligament (LCL) goes from the top part of the fibula (the bone on the outside of the lower leg) to the outside part of the lower thigh bone. The ligament helps keep the outer side of the knee joint stable.

The LCL is usually injured by pressure or an injury that pushes the knee joint from the inside, which results in stress on the outside part of the joint. Symptoms include swelling, the knee locking or giving way.

It means Ozil will miss four crucial Champions League fixtures, along with Premier League clashes against Manchester United and - in all probability - Liverpool.

He looks likely to be out of action for 12 domestic games.  

A statement on the DFB website read: 'The MRI examination today at National Dr Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt in Munich revealed a partial rupture of the outer band of the left knee joint.

'The treatment is conservative, with six weeks of immobilisation of the knee joint. Mesut Ozil is likely to be (out for) 10 to 12 weeks.'
