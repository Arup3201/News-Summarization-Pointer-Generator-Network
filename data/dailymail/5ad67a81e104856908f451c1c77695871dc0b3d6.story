Thug: Mark Phythian, 42, from Washington, Tyne and Wear, who punched his girlfriend's face so hard that her eye 'exploded'

A violent boyfriend who punched his girlfriend’s face so hard that her eye 'exploded' has been put behind bars for four years.

Sandra Banks said she heard a 'massive pop' before blood started pouring down her face after the blow by 'evil' Mark Phythian during a row at his home on her birthday.

Miss Banks told Newcastle Crown Court she has lost total vision in her right eye, which is now 'dead' and she may lose it completely.

Phythian, of Washington, Tyne and Wear who has convictions for attacks on Miss Banks in the past, denied causing grievous bodily harm, assault and acting in breach of a restraining order but was found guilty by a jury of all charges after a trial last month.

Judge Paul Sloan QC said the 42-year-old, who screamed foul language and said ‘you might as well hang me, just execute me’ as he was sentenced, posed a danger to women and extended his licence period by 12 months.

The judge told Phythian the attack on Miss Banks was a 'gross breach of trust and power'.

Judge Sloan added: 'As she described, her eye exploded and then poured blood. She experienced excruciating pain.

'As a result of the blow you struck she sustained a penetrating injury to her right eye and she has lost sight in her right eye.

'There is no chance of her regaining sight in that eye ever again.

'I am satisfied there is a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm occasioned by the commission by you of further specified offences.

'There is clearly a significant risk, to Miss Banks in particular, but also to future partners in general.'

Miss
Banks told jurors during the trial Phythian had ordered her to get back
with him when he was released from prison for a previous attack on her,
despite a restraining order being in place to keep him away.

Phythian was found guilty and sentenced to four years at Newcastle Crown Court

She said the first six weeks were 'alright', but he soon started acting violently again.

Miss Banks said on February 22, which was her birthday, a row at his home quickly escalated into violence.

Miss Banks said the initial assault on her happened in the bathroom where she was punched and hit with a towel rail before he followed her out of the room.

She said: 'He just looked at me, really evil, and just punched me in the face, really hard.

'My eye exploded, I just heard a massive pop and my eye started pouring with blood, I was screaming.

'I started screaming, crying, I had never felt pain like it in all my life.

'My eye was pouring with blood.'

Miss Banks told jurors Phythian had locked her in the house after the attack.

She said: 'I was screaming, crying, I was scared out of my wits, I wanted to die.'

Miss Banks was taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead before being transferred to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle for surgery.

She told the court: 'That eye, they told me it’s dead.

'There is no chance I will regain my sight ever again.'

Phythian told jurors it was Miss Banks who attacked him that night and he had lashed out to get her off him.

He denied forcing her to go back with him after his release from prison and said: 'I told her I was in love with her. She came with me.'

Phythian said he had bought Miss Banks a card and flowers for her birthday and had fallen asleep on the sofa while she was out.

He told jurors Miss Banks was crouched down in front of him when he woke.

Phythian said: 'I woke up, I was half asleep, I said "hi precious, happy birthday darling, I’ve got you some flowers".

'I put my hand on her cheek and went to give her a kiss.

'She spun around and latched onto my little finger, practically biting my little finger off.

'I didn’t have a choice, I hit her with my left hand, it was self defence, otherwise she would have bit my finger off.

'I didn’t have a choice.'

Phythian said there was a struggle in the bathroom afterwards when he feared she was going to harm herself with a razor.

Jurors rejected his claims outright.
