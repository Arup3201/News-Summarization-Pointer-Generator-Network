With Michael Fassbender, Gemma Arterton and Sir Paul McCartney among fans of his work, it's safe to say that artist Chris Moon has no shortage of celebrity followers.

Now the A-list favourite has turned his paintbrush on Hollywood for his third collection of paintings, A Splendid Isolation.

The works, which will go on display in London for the first time on Friday, include versions of some of LA's most iconic sights as well as haunting depictions of the desolate desert panoramas that surround Tinseltown.

Along with the pool at A-list favourite Chateau Marmont, Venice Beach, San Diego, Death Valley, and Las Vegas also get the Moon treatment, rendered lonely and haunting in his work.

The East London-born artist has made a name for himself thanks to his woozily abstract style of painting and deconstructed landscapes.

Described by Harper's Bazaar as 'a new art superstar', Moon, currently one of the UK's most important contemporary artists, was even favourably compared to Francis Bacon by AnOther magazine art critic Jean-Paul Pryor.

Yet despite the beauty of his work, Moon says the drawings of Arthur Conan-Doyle - created after he was sectioned - were an early inspiration.

Speaking to AnOther magazine, he explained: I think the drawings I had a book of were from his years in an asylum â€“ these bizarre interactions between human form and insects.

'My headspace was filled with this completely traditional form of painting infused with the completely surreal.'

While his own work has a surreal quality of its own, his delicately rendered Hollywood tableaux are far from bizarre, and rather than getting him sectioned, are more than likely to win him a few more A-list fans.

Michael Fassbender might just have to start paying more for his decor.

A Splendid Isolation is curated by Gilly Fox and opens on 28th March at the new gallery space at Forge & Co on Shoreditch High Street. See chrismoonart.com for more information.
