Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has revealed he has decided to give Thibaut Courtois the chance to impress in goal because of his youthfulness. 

Courtois will make his Premier League debut against Burnley on Monday after being given the nod to start over Petr Cech by the Portuguese tactician.

Mourinho has called on Cech to provide healthy competition  for the number one spot throughout the season.

Starter: Thibaut Courtois has been given the nod to start in goal ahead of Chelsea team-mate Petr Cech

On the bench: Cech will have to watch today's match between Burnley and Chelsea from the bench

'Ten years ago I had a difficult decision to make,' Mourinho told Sky Sports, 'with Carlo Cudicini giving fantastic performances. I made a decision for Petr Cech in 2004/05 because I had in my hands a 22-year-old who I thought could be in goal for years. This situation is similar. 

'We have to think about future and to give it to Courtois. I'm feeling so safe with having these two keepers with us.

'Petr is a fantastic professional. He only knew this morning, he has behaved professionally which is what we expect from him. I hope he will fight for his place and not sit in a comfortable chair accepting this.'
