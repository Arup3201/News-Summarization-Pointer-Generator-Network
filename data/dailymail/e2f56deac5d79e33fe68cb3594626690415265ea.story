Music from Rocky films was played at Goodison Park on Monday night but, by the end of a dispiriting draw with West Brom, the soundtrack to Beverley Hills Cop would have been more appropriate.

One win in 13 games, out of both cup competitions at the first hurdle for the first time in their distinguished history and with problems mounting, The Heat Is On Roberto Martinez and it is not showing any signs of being turned down.

Kevin Mirallas' controversial failure from the penalty spot was the headline-grabbing moment of the stalemate against West Brom and, perhaps, it was a symbol of where Everton currently stand. Sportsmail looks at some of the issues.

SPOT OF BOTHER

This is not the first time there has been dissent over an Everton player taking a penalty at Goodison Park. In May 1994, when the club's top-flight status was in grave danger, Neville Southall marched from his goal with the intention of taking responsibility against Wimbledon.

Graham Stuart, however, was adamant he would take it and did, beating Hans Segers. The significance of the West Brom penalty could not be equated – Southall, for one, doesn't think Mirallas did anything wrong – but it is still a serious issue.

Last season Everton's players were a tight unit. They maintain that is still the case but you now see bickering and individuals putting themselves first, which is what Mirallas did. If he was thinking of the team, he would have listened to Romelu Lukaku and Steven Naismith telling him to 'give it to Bainesy'.

Conspiracy theorists will think Mirallas acted with the aim of getting himself a move – he is on the radar of Tottenham, Atletico Madrid and Borussia Dortmund – but that is risible. He does not have a Machiavelli character and no self-respecting professional would do that.

You cannot help but wonder, though, whether Mirallas is unsettled and a parting of the ways may be inevitable in the summer. He has 18 months left on his contract but, having been on Merseyside for three years, would it really surprise if this Belgian moved elsewhere?

WHERE IS THE MARTINEZ MAGIC?

Back in April, when Arsenal had been flattened by one of the best Everton performances of the modern era, Martinez's stock could not have higher. Everton fans adored him and his name was being touted with a number of different positions.

The situation is very different today. It would be wrong to suggest Martinez is fighting to save his job but the pressure is growing on him to arrest this worrying slide. He has to find answers and placate a section of the fan base who harbour deep concerns.

There was a 'moment' against West Brom that underlined all is not well. When he substituted Everton's best performer Muhamed Besic, in the second half, there was uproar and booing. Martinez claimed Besic was injured but he didn't look to be struggling when sprinting off.

Martinez had the Midas touch in his first season for making substitutions that changed games but this year it has been lost and some of his critics will need to be convinced he is not a one-season wonder. The Everton team he is managing now looks slow and laboured, not fast and vibrant.

NOT BANKING ON BARKLEY

Martinez's enthusiasm for Ross Barkley has been boundless since he arrived at Goodison. He has compared him to Germany legend Michael Ballack and claimed that not even a Gareth Bale-sized fee would convince Everton to sell.

That enthusiasm, however, has created expectation. Barkley was thrilling last year but this season he has looked lost, never playing in the central position that suits him so well; he is going through the kind of dip all young players experience but, from some fans, there is no forgiveness.

He was pilloried at times for losing possession and as the game was meandering to its conclusion, the howls of frustration that Barkley was not going to win it became louder. He looks like a player that would benefit from some time on the sidelines. Martinez, though, is not concerned.

'Ross has got the top personality,' said Martinez. 'You get a player who loses the ball a couple of times and they hide. That's when you've got a real issue. With Ross Barkley, last season he was just a young man enjoying his football, now he's Ross Barkley and the opposition pay him extra attention.'

A GROWING SENSE OF UNEASE

Martinez should not be in charge of a group of players that are peering anxiously over their shoulders but they are running the risk of being sucked into the skirmishes at the bottom. They have their lowest points total after 22 games since 2000-01 and the fixture list is threatening.

After they return from a warm-weather training break, they face Crystal Palace (away), Liverpool (home), Chelsea (away), Leicester (home) and Arsenal (away), plus a Europa League assignment against Young Boys Berne. They need the hamstrung James McCarthy back for that sequence.

'The break will do us good,' said England defender John Stones. 'We will regroup and see where we are after that. We are not looking at the table. We are just focusing on how we can improve.'

How quickly Martinez finds the answers will determine how long the heat stays on him.
