Popular highstreet clothing chain H&M has urged the Bangladeshi government to increase the minimum wage for garment factory workers.

Bangladeshi factories, where some wages are as low as $37 a month (around £23), make clothes for H&M and other major companies such as Tesco, Wal-Mart, JC Penney, Marks & Spencer, Kohl's and Carrefour.

But Swedish fashion group H&M has called for a change in the treatment of countries factory workers - urging for a higher minimum wage and annual pay reviews.

Underpaid: Some workers in Bangladesh are paid as little as $36 a month - the equivalent of around £23

Chief executive Karl-Johan Persson said: 'We want to see a stable market in which people are treated with respect, and where the workers are properly compensated by their employers.'

Persson told a news conference he had met Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and urged the government to lift the minimum wage and introduce annual wage reviews.

Persson, who said H&M intended to grow its business in Bangladesh by 10-15 per cent annually, said it was in the country's interests to develop an advanced and mature textile industry.

He added: 'If a proper review system 
is created and enforced, these revisions will help address the basic 
needs of the workers and bring greater stability to the market.'

The
move comes as tensions continue to rise in the country with factory workers striking over poor pay and working condition in the country's 4,500 garment 
factories.

Earlier this year, a panel of judges in Cambodia, where H&M also sources garments, urged clothes factory owners to pay more and called on international fashion brands to do more to improve working conditions.

Analysts also believe that labour unrest and delayed shipping schedules may erode the advantage to retailers of low prices.

Clashes: The unrest and closure of numerous factories had caused delays to garment shipments

The Swedish store's Spanish rival 
Inditex has outperformed H&M in recent quarters, helped by its 
broader range of brands and by the fact it sources a smaller proportion 
of goods from Asia.

H&M
is the largest single buyer of Bangladeshi garments and imports about 
$1.5 billion (around £9.4million) of readymade clothes from the country,
trade officials said.

Garments
made up $19 billion (around £11.9billion) of Bangladesh's total exports
of $24 billion (around £15billion) in the year ended in June, 2012, 
according to government data.
