The Premier League are ready to tighten the rules on English player quotas to ensure that players like Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas and Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny would not in future qualify as ‘homegrown’.

In a bid to boost the England team, the Premier League will look at reforming its quota system, which currently states that eight of the Premier League’s 25-man squad have to be homegrown.

The rules are so lax that any players who have completed three years at an English club before the age of 21 are deemed homegrown — regardless of nationality.

Cesc Fabregas is deemed 'homegrown' because he spent over three years at Arsenal before turning 21

That has led to the farcical situation of Chelsea and Arsenal having Fabregas and Szcezsny listed among their homegrown players and Manchester City having Gael Clichy. Had City signed Paul Pogba from Juventus in January, he would also have qualified as homegrown within a few months as he had spent more than two years at Manchester United.

Increasingly, clubs have copied Arsenal’s model by poaching the best young European talent at 16 to bring them to their academies and ensure they qualify as homegrown under current rules. Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore acknowledges that the rules, implemented as part of the Premier League’s Elite Players’ Performance Plan (EPPP) for youth football, need a fresh look.

‘It will get looked at,’ said Scudamore. ‘We welcome foreign players, we welcome the best of foreign talent if we can get hold of it and therefore clubs don’t want to go down a route that restricts their ability to recruit that talent. On the other hand, clubs recognise they’re making a huge investment in these youth systems and they have to produce results.

Gael Clichy moved from Cannes to Arsenal at 16 and is now one of the few 'homegrown' players at Man City

‘Clearly EPPP has gone through what I call its development phase; it’s gone through its hardware phase, with its facilities and its pitches. Now it’s in its software phase, which is concentrating on outcomes. And outcomes must be getting players through the system and through into the first team. There will be a point in the next number of months where we will say, “Is it now time to have a look at that?” ’ 

Scudamore concedes that the idea of homegrown quotas was not implemented so major clubs could simply bypass young English players to bring through the best players from the rest of Europe, but he cannot promise what rule changes will be implemented. ‘You’ve asked me a question: do I think it will be looked at? Do I have any view as to what the outcome will be on any details of that? No I don’t.

‘We’ll sit with 24 academy managers in a room and talk it through and make sure the whole thing is done with their expertise and knowledge.’

If the Premier League were to change rules so a young player has to spend three years at a club before 18 to qualify as homegrown rather than before 21, it would almost immediately eliminate the ‘Fabregas issue’.

Players would then have to be at a club from 15 — and young players are not allowed to move across national boundaries, even European Union boundaries, before 16 unless there are exceptional circumstances, such as their parents moving country for work. Clubs cannot be told to employ only English players as that would be a breach of EU competition law.
