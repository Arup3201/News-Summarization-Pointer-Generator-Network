A brave young woman has posted a no make-up 'selfie' online - to show the true extent of the birthmark on her face.

Amy Elsegood, from Ripon, North Yorkshire, was determined to show people who she really was, posting the image on the internet.

The pretty 22-year-old has worn special make-up from the NHS since she was 11, helping her conceal the port wine stain on her right cheek.

Amy Elsegood received support form around the world after she bravely posted a selfie of her birthmark, left,  on Facebook. Pictured right, she used to use special make up to conceal her port wine stain

Having put the picture on Facebook, she is receiving messages of support from people around the world.

Miss Elsegood said: 'I wore it [the make-up] every time I left the house as I was too self-conscious to go out without hiding my birthmark first.

'But then one day I just thought, "you were born like this, there is no reason to be ashamed," so I posted a no make-up selfie.

'No-one could say anything negative that I haven’t heard before.

'The reaction on Facebook was amazing, I had over 600 likes with people all over the world messaging me, it was surreal.'

Although
 she had laser surgery from birth until the age of 10, Miss Elsegood decided
 that it was no longer necessary, hating the procedure.

She
 added: 'Laser treatment tends to work best when you’re young, making it
 less effective as I got older, but I know that without it that my 
birthmark would be a lot redder than it is now.

Despite the positive response Amy Elsegood has had to her no make-up selfie, she has been the target of bullies throughout her life

'I
 would probably think about having it again now that I’m older but with 
my cosmetic make-up I’m able to conceal my birthmark well anyway.'

Despite
 the positive response she has had to her no make-up selfie online, she 
has been a target for bullies throughout her life.

Miss Elsegood, said: 'I was about four years old when I realised I was different.

Port-wine stains are red or purple marks that often appear on the face but which can affect any area of skin.

They are caused by abnormal blood vessels and are most commonly present from birth.

According to patient.co.uk, about three in 1,000 babies are born with a port-wine stain - but they are not hereditary.

They vary in size and can if left untreated tend to get darker over the years.

A number of treatments have been tried including using laser and other light sources to reduce the redness of stains.

'Other kids would point at me, call me ‘blob face’ and say that I was ugly.

'I even had one woman come up to me on holiday to say that I would’ve been pretty if it wasn’t for my birthmark.'

When she became a teenager she thought she would find it difficult to find a boyfriend.

She added: 'I was so embarrassed by my port wine stain that I never thought anyone would accept me for who I was.

'But then I met Josh at 16, he was the same age but from a different school.

'The first time I met him I was wearing make-up to conceal what was underneath but after a few weeks into our relationship I wanted to show him the real me.

'I decided 
to meet him with no make-up on, I said "this is what I really look 
like," but he simply replied with "it makes no difference to me."

'We’ve been together for six years now.'

However, Miss Elsegood still felt self-conscious when leaving the house and did not go anywhere without wearing her cover-up.

Since posting her selfie online Miss Elsegood, pictured on holiday says she has gained confidence - and hopes the initiative will inspire others in a similar position

She said: 'It wasn’t until the cancer research no make-up selfie came about that I really accepted who I was.

'My birthmark doesn’t need to define me and no-one should be ashamed to show who they really are.

'Since posting my selfie online I have gained so much confidence, it’s been great helping others who are in a similar position too.

'I’ve learnt that there are much worse things to have in life and I’ve accepted me for me.'

Cheryl Cole joined the make-up free selfie trend by posting a picture of herself on Instagram

Amy Elsegood had her own reasons for posting a no make-up picture online.

But the craze of taking bare-faced selfies and posting them on the internet has swept the online world this year - and raised millions for charity.

The idea took off in March after huge numbers of women posted pictures of themselves wearing no make-up on social media websites - then nominated their friends to do the same.

In a matter of days the campaign had raised more than £8million for Cancer Research UK.

Among those to take part were a host of celebrities, including Prince Harry's ex-girlfriend Cressida Bonas, X-Factor judge Cheryl Cole, actresses Michelle Keegan and Helen Flanagan.

Michelle Heaton, Holly Willoughby and Kym Marsh also ditched make-up to show their natural beauty in their own bare-faced pictures.

At the time, Cancer Research UK said the donations would allow the charity to carry out 10 clinical trials that would not previously have been possible because of funding restrictions.
