Rapist footballer Ched Evans has been rejected by Tranmere Rovers, the League Two side facing a relegation dog fight.

Tranmere chairman Mark Palios claims to have turned down an approach from associates of the 25-year-old about the possibility of the convicted rapist playing for the club, which is currently second from bottom in the league and six points adrift of safety.

The former Wales international was jailed for five years after a jury unanimously agreed he raped a drunk woman in a Rhyl hotel while his friends filmed it in 2011.

Evans was released after serving half his sentence but is struggling to find a new club because of the furore over his crime and his lack of contrition.

Mark Palios and his wife Nicola, who have became the owners of League Two's Tranmere Rovers. Mr Palios says he was contacted by representatives of rapist Ched Evans about playing for the club

Palios said he had twice been contacted by people on behalf of Evans about possible talks but refused to pursue the idea. 

Evans continues to protest his innocence and has lodged an appeal with the Criminal Case Review Commission.

He was initially given permission by former club Sheffield United to return to train with the club at the request of players’ union, the Professional Footballers Association.

Following his release last month, pressure mounted on Sheffield United not to resign the player or welcome him back to its grounds.

A string of its patrons tendered their resignations over the issue, with Olympian Jessica Ennis-Hill vowing to have her name removed from one of the stands at Bramall Lane should he be reinstated. 

Following the backlash - 160,000 people signed a petition against it - the club retracted its offer last week.

Palios, former chief executive of the Football Association, and wife Nicola took control at Tranmere in August.

He said in a statement released to the Liverpool Echo: ‘Tranmere has not been approached by Ched Evans or his management team to discuss him joining the club.

‘However, on two occasions persons with a connection with Ched Evans offered to facilitate a discussion if I wished to pursue that.

‘I strongly believe in the general principle that people have a right to rehabilitation after serving a sentence for a crime.

‘However, I also take the view that whether any particular club would wish to employ someone who has been convicted of a very serious crime is a subjective decision for the club to take after considering all the circumstances, and that there is no simple right or wrong answer.

‘Nicola and I are trying to re-establish the brand of Tranmere as a family-friendly club and bringing Ched Evans in would clearly have alienated a significant number of supporters.

‘It would also have inevitably embroiled the club in much controversy and distraction, at a time when we need to keep a complete focus on rebuilding the club and setting firm foundations for the future.

‘I therefore took the view that it would not be in the best interests of the club to seek a dialogue with Mr Evans, notwithstanding his undoubted footballing talents.

‘Neither I nor the club will be making any further comment on this matter.’

Tranmere allowed Clayton McDonald, who was acquitted of rape when tried alongside Evans, to join the club on non-contract terms earlier in the season, but he was released after just one appearance.

Ched Evans' loyal fiancee Natasha Massey has stood by him and is running the campaign to have his conviction overturned.

Ms Massey appeared alongside Evans in a recent video he made, in which he insisted he was guilty only of infidelity - not the rape he was jailed for.

Two years ago the victim had to start a new life away from her friends and family in north Wales after nine people were convicted of illegally naming her in 2012, but now may have to do the same again.

The young woman was named at least 6,000 times on Twitter alone following the conviction of Wales international Evans and was labelled a ‘slag’, ‘tramp’, ‘bitch’ and ‘whore’.

Police put her ‘relocation package’ together after her lifelong anonymity — protection afforded to anyone who has made and allegation of a sexual assault — was breached on the internet.

Some of the abuse amounted to ‘psychological GBH’, to use the description of one senior detective, which left the girl ‘traumatised’. 

May 30, 2011: CCTV shows footballer Clayton McDonald meeting victim outside a kebab shop in Rhyl at around 4am, before taking a cab with her to a nearby Premier Inn. On the way he texts friend Ched Evans to say he's 'got a bird'.

Mr McDonald and Evans both had intercourse with the girl, and at one point two other men tried to film it though a window.

After waking up in the hotel room with no memory of the incident, the victim went to police, and later the same day Evans and Mr McDonald are both arrested.

July 26, 2011:  Evans and Mr McDonald are charged with rape, which they both deny.

April 11, 2012: Evans and Mr McDonald take the stand for the first time at Caernarfon Crown Court.

April 20: Mr McDonald is acquitted of rape, while Evans is found guilty and sentenced to five years in prison.

During the trial Evans told the court that he had gone to the hotel after getting a text from Mr McDonald, and let himself into the room where he found the pair having sex.

He claimed to have watched them before having sex with the victim himself, while two other men watched through the window and attempted to film it.

April 23: The victim is named for the first time online by supporters of Evans, who begin bombarding her with abuse that police will later compare to 'virtual GBH'.

Officers subsequently take the unusual step of giving the woman a false identity and moving her away from her home - protection usually reserved for high-profile murderers released from jail.

August: Evans has request to appeal his conviction turned down, though this is later overturned by the Court of Appeal in London.

November, 2013: Evans continues to deny guilt and recruits new legal team to help clear his name.

October 17, 2014: He is released from jail after serving half of his sentence and returns home to Rhyl where a bouncy castle is pictured being delivered to his parents' house, but is later taken away. 

October 18: Reports surface that Evans has been offered a £500,000 contract to re-sign for Sheffield United, though the club later deny the rumours. 

November 11: After a request from the Professional Footballers' Association, Sheffield United agree to allow Evans to return to the club to train, but refuse to say whether he will be signed.

The same day patron Charlie Webster, who was abused as a child, walks away from the club.

November 12: Lindsay Graham, another club patron, cuts her ties with the club along with another unnamed patron as 150,000 sign petition saying Evans should not be allowed to play again.

November 13: Jessica Ennis-Hill asks for her name to be removed from one of the club's stands, leading to abuse on Twitter.

November 17: Karl Massey, the millionaire father of Evans' girlfriend Natasha Massey, says he will offer the former-footballer a job at one of his firms if the club will not have him back

November 20: Sheffield United confirm that they have withdrawn the offer to allow Evans to train at their ground.

November 22:  The Ministry of Justice said while it cannot comment on individual prisoners, in general terms the terms of a sex offender's licence would render it near impossible to work abroad, scuppering any hopes that Evans may be signed overseas for the remainder of his sentence.
