A canoe race was dramatically stopped yesterday when a body was found floating in the water 15 minutes before the start.

A passer-by made the grim early morning discovery near the wharf on the Kennet and Avon Canal in Devizes, Wiltshire.

An investigation is now underway to determine how the man, who has not yet been identified, died and ended up in the water.

A body was found in the Kennet and Avon canal before the start of an annual canoe race

The 650 canoeists and kayakers were due to set off for the annual Devizes to Westminster race in a staggered start between 7am and 10am.

However, no one was allowed to get underway after the discovery of the body near to the start line at 6.45am.

Competitor Keith Horn was stuck at the starting line and tweeted: 'Having to chill for an hour as the start of canoe race has been delayed due to a police incident in the course.'

A Wiltshire Police spokesman said officers were liasing with the organisers about when the race could underway.

'An investigation is underway after the body of a male was discovered in the Kennet and Avon canal in Devizes this morning', said the spokesman.

'Wiltshire Police were alerted by a member of public who found the body of a male in the canal close to The Wharf in the town centre shortly before 6.45am.'

The gruelling 125-mile race pits competitors against each other over the four days of the Easter break.

The race has now been postponed until another date can be set.
