It is the latest mutt-have: A hug in a T-shirt.

The snug-fitting Equafleece, which comes in three colours, is said to relax nervous dogs, in the same way that swaddling soothes fractious babies.

As stress levels fall, the dogs find it easier to breathe and cope with their fears.

By lightly touching the skin from back to belly, it is believed to encourage the release of oxytocin, the ‘cuddle hormone’ credited with creating feelings of calmness and closeness.

Tate, a Tibetan terrier, is put in his Equafleece two or three times a week.

His owner, Lisa D’Aguiar, of North London, said: ‘He panics if he hears people outside.

‘The T-shirt makes him calmer. His nerves don’t completely go away but he is chilled and he looks adorable in it.’ 

Another happy customer, Kate Reeves 
from Shropshire, said: ‘I cannot believe how incredibly effective the 
t-shirt was in calming my very anxious greyhound and how quickly she 
changed from a shaking, drooling wreck into a snoozing, relaxed dog.

‘It continued to work brilliantly during fireworks and thunderstorms.’

Animal behaviour specialist Sarah Fisher says the Equafleece can also be used to reassure dogs that are anxious about travelling in a car or nervous of other animals.

Miss Fisher believes the hug-like feel of
the cotton over-rides the brain’s primeval instinct of fight or flight 
in terms of trouble.

Those with two legs also benefit.

She said: ‘The owner feels he has 
something proactive to do to help their dog instead of them getting 
worked up by whatever is going on.'

Miss Fisher, who assesses dogs for
court cases and teaches staff at animal shelters including Battersea 
Dogs Home, said that a normal T-shirt should also have a calming effect.

However, the Equafleece is a better option as it is doggy-shaped and contains enough stretch to allow pets to move properly.

She said: ‘I am not a fan of dressing up dogs but I am a fan of t-shirts for dogs because they are so calming.’

Dog coats and jackets are thought to be less beneficial because they do not completely close over the belly and so fail to make the creature feel like it is being enveloped in a hug.

The Equafleece t-shirts start at £13 for a Chihuahua or a small terrier.

  An XL shirt, for a retriever or a large greyhound costs £19.
