A 21 year old medical student shot a one-second video every day for eight months and turned it into a 3:57 minute video, capturing the simplistic beauty of life.

Kieran Collins from Cairns, North Queensland, was in Brisbane December last year when he came across a similar video of a man traveling through Europe.

'It was pretty cool so I thought I'd try my own version,' he told Daily Mail Australia.

'The next day I took out my camera and started shooting.'

Unlike the original video that inspired Mr Collins, his vision was to capture moments from his 'normal life', living day to day and reflect on the simple things in life.

'I didn't do anything crazy, it was just me living my normal life and doing things that are pretty mundane but then you look back and you don't even realise what you go through in your day.

'It allows you to take a totally different perspective on life.'

Mr Collins recorded a special moment each day for eight moments, turning it into a video montage called 'Life'.

'Originally it was for me to document my life and reflect on it, but once I watched it I thought it was interesting so I put it on Facebook and YouTube.

'I now have a snap shot of my life.'

The video 'Life' has had over 1,400 views on YouTube.
