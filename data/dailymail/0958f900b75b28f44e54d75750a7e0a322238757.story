Outspoken politician Jacqui Lambie has spoken out against self-styled WA sheik Junaid Thorne for his comments regarding the Paris terrorist attacks, calling for him to be jailed for treason.

Ms Lambie has branded Thorne, who is in his 20's, as a 'mongrel' for suggesting that insults to the Prophet Mohammed are 'not allowed' and 'very likely to stimulate some kind of response'. 

In a statement, Ms Lambie blamed previous  governments for failing to protect Australian citizens against these type of extremists living amongst us.

'There are now Australian citizens (like the mongrel in WA) who brazenly, express public sympathy and support for the actions of the Islamic extremists,' Ms Lambie said. 

Junaid Thorne, who spent 14-years growing up in Saudi Arabia, took to social media after the Paris killings, claiming that the victims has failed to learn from the Charlie Hebdo office firebombings in 2011.

'When you provoke an enormous number of people, or degrade the followers of a religion by insulting something or someone they hold sacred, don't expect to be left alone,' he said.

According to Lambie, there are more than 20 Australian citizens fighting for Islamic state and there are at least 100 Islamic state Australian citizen supporters who are living among us.

'I suspect many more, given the growing public support that Islamic groups now give for the imposition of the extremist Sharia Law in Australia,' she said. 

Ms Lambie called for Thorne and other extremists living in Australia to be tried for treason before they 'seek to impose their culture on us - or kill us'.

'These savages hate our democratic way of life, which attempts to accommodate difference of political opinion, thought, freedom of speech and religion, while trying to respect basic human rights,' she said.   

'So the time has come for ordinary Australians to wake up. The time has come for the Abbott Government to act swiftly and deal decisively with these traitorous individuals.'

Thorne moved to Saudi Arabia with his brother Shayden and his father, an Indigenous man of the Noongar clan, when he was nine-years-old.

His father found a job in the country after divorcing Thorne's mother, a Malaysian Muslim who lives in Perth.

Growing up in the devout family, Thorne claims he could recite the Koran by the age of six. However, life in Saudi Arabia was not without difficulty.

His brother was imprisoned for allegedly possessing terrorism-related material on a lap top, according to reports, and remained imprisoned for two-and-a-half years when he was granted clemency. Junaid was deported to Australia after protesting his detention in 2012.

After returning to Australia, Thorne began to tour the country, delivering lectures about Islam in front of the flag of a little known radical group known as Millatu Ibrahim, which is banned in Germany.

He also delivered talks about how to 'exorcise jinn' - or genies - which he said are affecting people across the country.

Over the past six months, the self-styled sheikh has become a controversial figure.

He branded Australian authorities 'the real terrorists' after police swooped on properties across in Sydney in September.

He has been outspoken in defence of some of his associates and supporters, including terror suspects Abdul Numan Haider, 18, and Sulayman Khalid, 20.
