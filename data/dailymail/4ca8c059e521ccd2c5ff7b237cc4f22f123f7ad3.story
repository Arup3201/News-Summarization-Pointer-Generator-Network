George Osborne's taunts have hit a nerve in Paris, after the Chancellor boasted that Britain's booming economy was storming ahead of France.

Senior Tories have repeatedly contrasted the UK's strong recovery with the sluggish growth and high unemployment on the other side of the Channel where socialist Francois Hollande has floundered.

Now French minister Segolene Royal has hit back at the 'spiteful and inappropriate' attacks, and warning: 'What goes around comes around.'

In his Budget statement last week, Mr Osborne made several references to Britain's strong growth compared to France.

He mocked the high rate of French unemployment, quipping that one English county - Yorkshire - had created more jobs than the whole of France.

He pointed to forecasts suggesting the British economy grew by 2.6 per cent last year, '50 per cent faster than Germany, three times faster than the euro-zone – and seven times faster than France'.

He and the Prime Minister also pointed to the UK's nearest continental neighbour as a lesson of why Labour - whose leader closely associated himself with the approach of Socialist Party president Francois Hollande - would be bad for Britain.

'Our economy is growing seven times faster than France's,' Mr Cameron wrote in the Sunday Times. 

'Imagine if Miliband had been free to pursue his French dream: the fallout would be felt in catastrophic job losses, falling living standards, eye-watering debt and fast-diminishing hope in our future.' 

The UK economy has enjoyed much stronger growth than France since the crash in 2008, according to Eurostat

Unemployment has also fallen more sharply in the UK than on the other side of the Channel where more than 10 per cent were out of work in 2014

Asked about the attacks, Ms Royal told BBC2's Newsnight: 'I am very surprised by what I consider to be something which seems so far removed from the traditional British sense of fair play.

'It is rather condescending. It seems a little spiteful and inappropriate.'

European countries 'should all stand together when any country is in difficulty', she said.

'When a country like the UK is facing difficulty, we don't make fun. In your country your budget deficit is much greater than it is in France, we don't have take pleasure from it.

'In the end, what goes around comes around.' Ms Royal is the ex-partner of Mr Hollande. The pair, who have four children together, never married, reportedly because they considered it 'too bourgeois'.

The French economy has struggled since the financial crisis as it struggles to reform its bloated public sector

Ms Royal has four children with French President Francois Hollande, who has had a string of relationships since they split in 2007

London Mayor Boris Johnson added to the row today, by again taunting the French over their economy

But London Mayor Boris Johnson added to the row today, by again taunting the French. 

In an appearance on LBC Radio, he claimed talented people are fleeing 'crazed socialist' France as part of an attack he launched on Labour leader Ed Miliband.

The mayor said: '(Labour) have an overt admiration for the way things are done in France, where they have unemployment now running at around 12 per cent.

'You've got huge numbers of talented French people fleeing France at the moment because it's a crazed socialist, 1970s version of a European economy.'
