Two men struggle with a sack out on a windswept frozen lake until one protests, in deaf sign language, that the hole in the ice is too small, and the other grasps the leg of the body protruding from the bag and signs, 'guy's too fat'.

The solution? Get a chainsaw.

A truck rumbles along a frozen highway, and as it passes an icy breeze loosens the snow on the side bank to reveal a pair of human nostrils protruding from the drift.

Soothing piped music is playing as a man pushing a shopping trolley along the aisle of a hardware store throws in his purchases: an axe, duct tape, a crow bar, a hunting knife, boxes of ammunition, and a rifle bag.

Fargo teaser: Two men struggle with a sack out on a windswept frozen lake until one protests, in deaf sign language, that the hole in the ice is too small, and the other grasps the leg of the body protruding from the bag and signs, 'guy's too fat'

Looks familiar: the booted foot which is presumably connected to a body which the two men in the frozen mid-west of northers US cannot fit through a hole in the ice, a problem they solve in the teaser's final scene with a chainsaw, a cinematic nod to the original film's woodchipper scene

Retail therapy: Soothing piped music is playing in this video teaser for the new Fargo TV series which shows a man pushing a shopping trolley along the aisle of a hardware store and throwing in his purchases, an axe, duct tape, a crow bar, a hunting knife, boxes of ammunition and a large rifle bag

In another teaser video for the upcoming new TV series based on the 1996 hit film Fargo, Billy Bob Thornton attacks the windscreen of his car with an ice scraper.

Yes, the Coen brothers are back with their dark comedy set in the tundras of a Minnesota winter, and the clever series of videos - with no dialogue and grisly, suggestive scenes - would seem to indicate audiences are in for.

Joel and Ethan Coen directed the original film, which starred William H Macy as the struggling car salesman Jerry Lundergaard, who hires two hitmen to kidnap his wife.

The film also stars Joel Coen's real-life wife Frances McDormand, as pregnant police chief Marge Gunderson, who investigates three local homicides.

The Coens acted as producers of the new ten-episode TV series, which was developed by screenwriter Noah Hawley (Bones),and stars Martin Freeman as Lester Nygaard, a man who has his life drastically changed when he encounters a mysterious man who arrives in town.

Billy Bob Thornton, a Coen brothers favourite, plays Lorne Malvo, a boastful and manipulative crook who FBI agents Keegan-Michael Key and Jordan Peele are obsessed with tracking down.

In one of the teasers, the scene where the 'fishermen' who speak sign language as they attempt to stuff a body down an ice hole, would seem to reference the famous scene in the original film when Marge happens upon one of the hit men feeding the body of the other into a woodchipper.

Nose in the snow: in the scene much like the original film's opener, a truck rumbles along an icy highway. In the TV teaser, when the truck passes, snow drifts off the bank exposing a set of human nostrils poking from the drift

Angry ice scraper: in a moment like the William H Macy scene in the original Fargo movie, Billy Bob Thornton takes to the windscreen in the new Fargo TV series in which he plays Lorne Malvo, a boastful and manipulative crook FBI agents are obsessed with tracking down

Each teaser offers some nod to the film, on which this series is loosely based, reports cinemablend.com.

The 'Roadside', in which the pair of human nostrils protrudes from a snowbank, is a reminder of the film's opening scene.

The Billy Bob Thornton teaser is like the film scene in which a red-faced William H Macy as an angry Jerry Lundegaard attacks the windscreen with an ice scraper.

In the FX spin-off, Freeman as Nygaard plays a henpecked insurance salesman who is based loosely on the Macy role.

The series also stars Oliver Platt (The Big C) and Bob Odenkirk (â€˜Better Call Saulâ€™ in Breaking Bad), Kate Walsh (Greys Anatomy), and tom Hank's son Colin Hanks (Mad Men, Orange County and Parkland).

The dark humour and Midwest setting remains, but the series has an entirely new plot. It was filmed in Canada and premiers in the US on April 15.
