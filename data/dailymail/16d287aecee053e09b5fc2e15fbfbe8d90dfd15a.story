Bears have become a motorway hazard for drivers along a stretch of road in Russia where the hungry animals are begging for food.

While the bears approach cars and wait for their next drive-by meal, motorists are throwing out treats to the animals along the highway which links the oil-rich cities of Khanty-Mansiysk to Tyumen in the remote region of Uvatsky.

But police are warning people not to feed the brown bears because they are at risk of being attacked when they unwind their car windows.

A teddy bears picnic: Bears have become a major hazard begging drivers for food

Sergey Zaitsev, head of the village Gornopravdinsk which is close to the spot where the animals gather to grab their grub, said it is sometimes impossible for drivers to pass because there are so many animals on the road.

He said: 'Bears are attracted by the easy food, which the truck drivers share with them.

'Just yesterday I threw cans of sweet condensed milk and tins of meat to a bear with cubs.'

Luckily no-one has been attacked yet on the route but one bear was reportedly knocked down by a driver before it fled to a nearby wood.

Locals have even started naming the animals and the fastest cub has become known as Piston. 

But Andrey Pitukhin, head of traffic at the area's police department, told The Siberian Times: 'It often happens that the traffic police has to resolve the situation, for example, the police sounding their horns makes bears run away. 

'We urge drivers to be careful and not to speed up.

'Use the horn if bears appear, and whatever happens do not feed them.'
