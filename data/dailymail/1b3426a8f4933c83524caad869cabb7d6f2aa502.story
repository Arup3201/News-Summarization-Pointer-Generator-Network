One in five gay teenagers in schools across Britain are being subjected to bullying by teachers or other adults, new research has shown.

Another third of gay male pupils said they left school without being taught anything about HIV or safe sex, despite a spike in infections nationwide.

A survey by the National Aids Trust (NAT), which quizzed more than 1,000 gay or bisexual men aged 14 to 19, also found that more than half had experienced some form of discrimination.

More than half of gay teenagers said they had been bullied at school. While 99 per cent said they had been targeted by a classmate, 39 per cent said their tormentor was a teacher or adult (file image)

Of those 99 per cent said they had been targeted by another pupil, while 75 per cent said they received online abuse, reports The Independent.

However, another 39 per cent said the bullying had been at the hands of a teacher or another adult at their school.

Deborah Gold, the chief executive of NAT, said: 'It's an incredibly high number. 

'The idea that teachers or other adults at school are sometimes responsible for bullying and discrimination is utterly unacceptable.'

The survey also showed a worrying lack of education among young men about the spread of HIV and safe sex, despite them being in the most at-risk group in the UK.

Two thirds of those surveyed said they had not been given information about testing for the killer virus, while a third were given no information about the spread of HIV.

Another three quarters were also unaware of the drug PEP, which can help prevent infection if it is given to a patient within three days of them being exposed to HIV.

Three quarters of pupils also said they had been given no information on same sex relationships during sex educations lessons.

Ms Gold added: 'The number of young men who have sex with men who are contracting HIV is increasing. I think there's an absolute link between the lack of this education at a time when people need it and the consequences of that.'

While education on HIV is required as part of the science curriculum, it is only recommended as part of social and health education classes, with campaigners calling its application 'patchy'.

The most recent figures from Public Health England show that HIV infection rates among men who have sex with men are at an all-time high, and are continuing to rise.

In 2012 there were 3,250 new diagnoses of HIV among this group, pushing the total to more than 40,000, of which around 7,300 were unaware they had the virus.
