David Cameron today revealed his delight at being seen as just another ‘middle-aged slightly overweight man’ when out jogging as he expressed his regret at losing his privacy since becoming Prime Minister.

In a deeply-personal interview he spoke of the ‘all encompassing’ life in Number 10, his struggle to find time for his family and being grilled by the Queen.

He also ruled out taking part in Strictly Come Dancing, or any reality show which involved ‘taking my clothes off or eating insects’ but hinted at a desire to complete in the Great British Bake Off.

Appearing on Steve Wright in the Afternoon on BBC Radio 2 Mr Cameron admitted that he was surprised by the sudden loss of privacy when he took power in May 2010.

‘When you’re leader of the opposition as I was for five years you are in the public eye and running a political party but you still have a lot of privacy, you don’t have a lot of security.

‘So when I became prime minister, I suppose the first time you try and open the door of the car and you realise it weighs about five tonnes and its quite difficult to open…

‘You suddenly realise: I can’t pop down to the newsagents anymore and buy a packet of bacon and a newspaper. That was the biggest shock actually in terms of the privacy.’

The PM revealed he felt at his most anonymous when exercising in parks around Westminster, when no-one seem to notice they are within feet of the man running the country.

‘I try. I go for a run once or twice a week around the parks or something,’ he said.

David Cameron revealed he has to prepare for his weekly grilling by the Queen because she expects him to know what is going on.

They meet every Tuesday or Wednesday evening for an hour.

While the Queen never actually tells him his time is up 'the conversation naturally comes to an end', he said.

'And you are very conscious as Prime Minister that I am her twelfth. She started with Winston Churchill, she’s hear it all before, and I think Prime Ministers find it very valuable to try and explain the difficult decisions and problems the country faces.

'You are in the presence of someone who has heard and seen all these problems before.'

And he hinted that she made sure he was on top of everything.

'You have to make sure you are well informed too, if I can put it that way.'

He said he does not wear a ‘disguise’ but instead tries to go running at ‘strange times of day’.

He
 added: ‘Actually the thing about the parks in London is its mostly full
 of tourists who just see some middle-aged slightly overweight man 
trotting past them and they just think it’s another one.’

Whatever the Prime Ministerial exercise regime involves, it is not dancing.

Despite heaping praise on the BBC for ‘making the good popular and the popular good, with shows like Eastenders, he ruled out ever following in Vince Cable’s footsteps to take part in Strictly Come Dancing.

‘No, I don’t think so. I think my dancing is probably best done privately,’ he insisted.

Asked if he would maybe prefer Great British Bake-Off, I’m A Celebrity or another reality show, he hinted at having his culinary talents judged by Mary Berry and Paul Hollywood.

‘I think I am probably better cooking something than either taking my clothes off or eating insects,’ he said.

A fan of Homeland, he was given the US series Elementary for Christmas, a New York-based remake of Sherlock Holmes starring Jonny Lee Miller.

But he gets little chance to watch TV. ‘It’s certainly true that this job is all encompassing and you never take your eye off it.

‘If I go upstairs at the end of the day with the children you are still on the phone you are still contactable at any moment if there’s any decision that needs to be taken or anything difficult happening anywhere in the world.

‘I’m lucky I’ve got an amazing wife in Samantha and we absolutely love our life together, we are so proud of our children and we try and make time for each other and make sure at the end of the day we sit down and have something to eat and chat about what the children are up to and what’s she doing and what I’ve done and then like everybody else I guess half an hour of Silent Witness and then we’re both asleep.’

Mr Cameron says he tries to find time every night to eat with wife Samantha, to whom he dedicated a song after 18 years of marriage

He has previously boasted of being a fan of The Killers, The Smiths, Mumford and Sons, Emiliana Torrini and Florence and the Machine.

But now David Cameron has revealed Brit Award-nominee Tom Odell is his latest favourite artist.

The PM said: 'I don’t know who is going to win the Brit awards. I think Tom Odell has got a lovely voice.

'I have been married to Samantha for 18 years this year, she is an amazing woman, and I think his song grow old with me for old romantics like me is a good one.'

During a series of quick fire questions, Mr Cameron refused to say who would be the next Prime Minister - 'Luckily I don’t get to choose' - or who he wants to be in coalition with next time, stressing he wants a Tory majority.

'I'm not looking for another coalition. I've done coalition; I've got the T-shirt,' he said.

'If people want more of the things that we've been able to do - getting the country back to work, cutting people's taxes, getting the economy moving, sorting out our schools, capping welfare, sorting out immigration...more Conservative MPs, a Conservative government, that's the way to deliver it.'

Asked if he beleives his old friend Boris Johnson when he says he does not want to be Prime Minister, Mr Cameron replied: 'I have a very clear view about Boris – he is a talented mayor of London, a brilliant man and I think he’s got a lot more to give to public life.

'I wouldn’t set the bar on his ambitions.'

Asked what sort of leader he is -  inclusive, easy-going, dictatorial, or instinctive - he replied: 'I hope a bit of all those things and not too much of any of them. The way I try to do this job is to build a strong team.'

But he admitted it is difficult to focus on the long-term when faced with the day-to-day pressures of running the country.

'I’m not complaining about the media, that would be like a farmer complaining about the weather.

'There’s a lot of short-term pressures but you have got to try and keep your eyes on the horizon.

'The things you do now, where will that leave the country in the future.'
