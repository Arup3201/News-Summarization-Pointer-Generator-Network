German cars have out-muscled their Japanese rivals to become the best-value models on Britain’s roads, according to motoring experts.

Volkswagen and BMW models led the way among vehicles that cost drivers the least over a three-year period – a list usually dominated by Japanese brands.

Although they have long been envied for their engineering, design and luxury, German cars are rarely considered cheap to buy or to run.

Driving a bargain: A table of the best-value cars in ten categories, according to analysis by What Car? magazine

But analysis by the magazine What Car?
found German-owned marques topped seven out of the ten categories for 
being the best value for money.

The
data takes into account the ‘best purchase price’ which is achieved 
after haggling with a dealer as opposed to the price on the ticket, and 
how much the car can be sold for after three years.

It then works out the running costs over the three years of ownership, including tax, parts, servicing, insurance and fuel.

In
the ten categories, three were topped by VW brands, with the Passat 
named best-value family car, the Golf in the estate category and the 
Scirocco top coupe.

Leading the way: The Volkswagen Passat is the most cost-effective family car, according to the new study

Top deal: VW also came up trumps in the coupe category with the Scirocco, which costs around £15,700 to run over a three-year period

The Octavia from VW-owned Skoda was 
named the best-value small family car. BMW scored two successes under 
its own badge with the 5 Series named best-value executive car and the 
£31,000 X3 as the best-value sports utility vehicle.

The BMW-owned Mini One Convertible was named as the best-value convertible.

The
other two categories saw the £7,000 Hyundai i10 named as best-value 
city car and the Ford Fiesta 1.25i as the top supermini.

The
magazine said: ‘The i10 is one of the best city cars out there, and 
it’s also one of the cheapest to buy and run. It doesn’t get much better
than that for buyers on a budget.’

Easier on the wallet: The BMW 5-Series, which costs £28,000 to buy and a further £21,000 to run for three years, was named the best-value executive car

Maximum value: The BMW-owned Mini One Convertible was judged the cheapest open-top model to keep

At the other end of the scale, the most expensive winner was the BMW X3 which can cost £42,000 with all the extras.

The What Car? findings are the latest triumph for German cars over their Japanese rivals.

The
VW Up also won What Car? overall Car of the Year for 2012 last month 
and Audi, Porsche and Mercedes were winners in their various classes.

Small, but mighty: The £7,000 Hyundai i10 came out as the best-value city car when all the various running costs were considered

Smart buy: Top of the pile in the supermini category was the Ford Fiesta 1.25i

Chas Hallett, editor of What Car?, said buyers should not pay the asking price for any of the cars in its awards.

He said: ‘Another weapon in the car buyer’s arsenal is what we call the target price. This is the achievable discount What Car? has haggled on every car.

‘If a dealer won’t match the target price then we will put the car buyer in touch with one who will.’
