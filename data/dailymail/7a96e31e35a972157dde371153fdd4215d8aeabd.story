A classic car which is thought to have inspired the first ever Rolls-Royce has sold for almost £600,000. 

The 1903 Panhard Levassor 16HP, which once belonged to Charles Stewart Rolls's father, Lord Llangattock, is thought to have influenced one of the famous car maker's earliest designs.

The French vehicle was purchased by an anonymous buyer at a Bonhams sale ahead of the annual Royal Automobile Club's London to Brighton Run on Friday.

The Rolls Royce 10hp may have been inspired by the Panhard Levassor 16HP which was built a year earlier

Experts believe C.S. Rolls, who was 25 
when his aristocrat father bought the car, based his early designs on 
the rear-entrance vehicle whose coachwork was produced by Labourdette of Paris. 

It remained in the same family since 1935 until being sold for £583,000 at the weekend - some £30,000 more than was expected.

Malcolm Barber, the Bonhams Group CEO who sourced the Panhard, described it as 'part of motoring history'.

'Once in a while you find a car that really excites you, even after a lifetime of finding and selling automotive gems. 

'This
car has it all, history, looks, provenance. I have driven alongside it 
many times while on the London to Brighton Run,' he said.

The Levassor, which has a four-cylinder engine, is known as a tonneau and has taken part in the annual London to Brighton Run since 1958.

C.S Rolls teamed up with Henry Royce to unveil the Rolls-Royce 10hp in 1904.

Rolls, whose name is now synonymous with the aviation and automotive industries, died in 1910 at the age of 32.

He
was the first Briton to be killed in a flying accident when the tail of
his Wright Flyer broke off during a flying display in Southbourne, 
Bournemouth.

Over 500 cars took part in the annual London to Brighton Run yesterday morning.

Veteran car enthusiasts set off from Hyde Park at around 7am, and arrived at the Sussex seafront some two hours later.

Other vehicles of the Panhard marque took part in the drive which only features cars built before January 1, 1905.

The event, put on by the Royal Automobile Club, commemorates the raising of the official speed limit in 1896.

The car was the first design produced by Rolls and his famous partner Henry Royce in 1904, just one year after the Panhard

Veteran cars from all over the world were shipped to London to take part, with some valued at several million pounds.

The Bonhams sale that took place on Friday traditionally kicks-off the weekend's events, with a Concours show taking place on Saturday ahead of Sunday's run.
