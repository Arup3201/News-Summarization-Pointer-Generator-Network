A plane with 28 passengers was forced into an emergency landing after an engine fire alert just before it was due to land at London City Airport.

The twin propeller plane, which was also carrying three crew members, was mid-air when there was a safety warning relating to one of the plane's two engines.

The aircraft, which had taken off from Jersey this morning, was due to land at London City Airport but had to be diverted to Southend Airport, Essex.

The twin propeller plane, which was also carrying three crew members, was mid-air when there was a safety warning relating to one of the plane's two engines

The plane's automatic systems shut down one of the engines as a precautionary measure and the aircraft was able to land using one engine. Nobody was injured during the incident.

Firefighters who inspected the engine said there was no fire when the aircraft landed but that it could have been 'an extremely serious incident'.

Meanwhile, a spokesman for Blue Islands, which operated the flight, said the incident appears to have been a false alarm.  

Divisional Officer Neil Fenwick, who attended the incident for Essex fire service, said: 'This was a text book operation. The fire was out by the time the plane touched down and no-one appears to have been hurt.

'The plane landed safely on one engine and automatic fire suppression systems on board had completely extinguished the fire.

'Our crews made sure that the fire was fully out but were not required to take any further action. We left the scene in the hands of the airport.

'This had the potential to be an extremely serious incident but everything which should happen in a situation like this did and the plane was able to land safely.'  

Tracy Jones, spokeswoman for Southend Airport, said the aircraft involved was operated by Blue Island Airways and had been travelling from Jersey. It was due to land at London City Airport.

Passengers on the SI712 have now been transported to the terminal and will be taken by coach to London City Airport.   

Blue Islands runs flights from Jersey and Guernsey to Amsterdam, Bristol, Chambery, Geneva, London City, Paris and Southampton. 

A spokesman said: 'At approximately 08:28 local this morning, the Blue Islands flight SI712 Jersey to London City with 28 passengers and three crew on-board, experienced a safety warning.

The plane made an emergency landing at London Southend Airport (pictured) just before 9am today 

'As a precautionary measure the engine was shut down, and this flight followed standard procedures and diverted to London Southend Airport. The aircraft landed safely at London Southend at 08:48.

'The aircraft is currently being inspected by engineers at Southend. Initial indications are that no fire took place and it appears to be a false alert.

'The passengers were then transported by road to London City Airport. Passenger, crew and aircraft safety is our number one priority at all times.'

In a separate incident, two passengers were taken to hospital after an aeroplane veered off the runway as it landed at Stornoway Airport on Lewis.

The incident, which took place at 8.33am today, involved a Saab 340 aircraft operated by Loganair.

The Scottish Ambulance Service said two people were taken to Western Isles Hospital with minor injuries.

An investigation has been launched and it is hoped normal operations will resume once the plane has been removed from the runway.

In a statement, Stornoway Airport said: 'Efforts to remove the aircraft from the runway are ongoing and investigations into the cause of the incident are under way.

'It is it our intention to resume normal operations as soon as the aircraft is safely removed from the runway. There are no scheduled arrivals or departures at Stornoway until later this afternoon.'
