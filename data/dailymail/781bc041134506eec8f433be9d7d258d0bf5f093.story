A baby orangutan is fighting to overcome his appalling encounter with humans which saw him caged in a chicken coop and fed on condensed milk for virtually the whole of the ten months he has been alive.

Named Budi, the milk provided virtually no nourishment for him, causing his bones to become malformed in his tiny body.

And vets from a British animal welfare charity nursing him back from the brink of death say he cried like a human baby when he was rescued in Indonesia from his hellish life as a family pet.

'No living creature should be forced to live in excruciating pain and misery for months on end – least of all a helpless baby orangutan with no loving mother to comfort him,' said Alan Knight OBE, the CEO of International Animal Rescue charity based in Uckfield in East Sussex.

'Budi was kept in a chicken cage by his owner and fed on nothing but condensed milk. During that time she didn't give him a single mouthful of solid food for fear it would be bad for him.

'He was deprived of all the nutrients that are vital to the development of a young baby. His owner's ignorance and neglect were killing him slowly and painfully.

'It breaks my heart to think of the pain Budi was in as he became more and more sick. Eventually his owner told the authorities that she wished to hand over the small baby orangutan she was keeping as a pet.'

By this time he was in a pitiful state.

'His little body was bloated with fluid from severe malnutrition and his limbs were swollen and bent. He was completely unable to move or even sit up on his own. At more than a year old he should have been strong enough to climb and swing: instead he was as helpless as a newborn baby.

'When our team lifted Budi out of his cage in Kubing in Borneo to prepare him for the journey to our rescue centre ten hours away in Sungai Awan, his eyes literally filled with tears and he cried in agony.

'Everyone was distressed beyond words to see how much pain he was in. I don't know how much longer he could have endured so much suffering.'

It was touch and go whether Budi would survive the journey. IAR vets made him as comfortable as possible and medicated him to try to relieve his suffering. But the little fighter made it and is now, slowly, getting stronger by the day.

IAR director Karmele L Sanchez, leading the team that is nurturing Budi, said: 'Since being admitted to our centre just a few weeks ago he has started to make a slow recovery.

'He is suffering from severe anaemia and, as you can see from the photos, months of malnutrition have left his joints swollen and badly deformed. He is being treated for a serious metabolic disease that may have caused permanent damage to his bones.

'I would like to reassure you that Budi's life is no longer in danger but he is still very weak and it is too early to say what long term damage he may have suffered during his months of starvation and captivity. The treatment and care he receives in the months ahead are going to be critical to Budi's future.

'In spite of all he has suffered, he is fighting very hard to survive. It's remarkable that such a small, vulnerable creature can show so much spirit and such a strong will to live.

'He is old enough to be climbing in the trees, but at this point he can only sit up on his own for short periods, and cannot fully move his arms or legs. However with good nutrition, supplements and therapy from the medical team, we hope he will continue to improve.'

Alan Knight has called upon MailOnline readers to donate money if they can to help pay for his treatment. He added: 'Budi's story is a particularly sad and distressing one I know. But please rest assured that he is receiving expert treatment and care at our centre and with your help now stands the best chance of recovery.'

Orangutans are under threat in their natural habitat like never before.

The lowland forest habitats of Asia's only great ape are quickly disappearing, being cut down for timber or burned to make way for palm oil plantations and other agricultural development.

Orangutans are an easy target for hunters, killed for food in some areas or in revenge attacks when they move into agricultural areas and destroy crops. Females in particular are most often hunted. 

When caught with offspring, the young are often kept as pets by ignorant owners with no idea of their needs.
