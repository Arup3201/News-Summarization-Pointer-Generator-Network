Michael Jackson had a child-sized porcelain doll in bed with him on the day he died, it emerged today in the trial of the star's personal doctor.

The doll, with rouged cheeks and blonde curly hair and dressed in green dungarees, was discovered on top of the covers after the King of Pop collapsed in the bedroom of his Los Angeles mansion.

A photo of the toy lying next to a CD player was shown to the jury in the Conrad Murray trial. It was taken by coroner's officers who searched the house hours after Jackson died on June 25 2009.

Bizarre: Jurors in the Conrad Murray trial were show this picture of a life-sized baby doll which was found on Jackson's deathbed

Photos of the doll and drugs with Jackson were seen during testimony from Los Angeles County coroner investigator Elissa Fleak, seen here on Thursday

The court also saw a police photograph 
of ornate dinner plates with babies faces - thought to be Jackson's 
children - displayed on a chest of drawers along with family snaps of 
Prince, Paris and Blanket.

Jurors also saw plates with babies' faces on them, believed to be Jackson's children, in the room where he died

The unprecedented glimpse into the singer's bedroom came during testimony by coroner's investigator Elissa Fleak. A photo was also shown of Jackson's black bomber jacket and a pair of trousers left on the floor of the en suite bathroom.

Later on Thursday toxicologist Dan Anderson told the court that Jackson had six different drugs in his system when he died.

They included Propofol and another milder anaesthetic, lidocaine, sedatives Ativan, Versed and Valium as well as a small trace of ephedrine, a drug used to treat hypertension.

The drugs showed positive in tests in Jackson's blood, liver, urine and stomach contents.

Michael Jackson's private suffering was revealed in the Conrad Murray trial on Wednesday as jurors were shown the incredible array of drugs stashed at the singer's home and listened to audio of his slurred voice explaining how he felt the pain of abandoned children because he never had a childhood himself.

The quantity of drugs, displayed by the Deputy District Attorney, David Walgren, was almost as shocking as the eerie recording from beyond the grave, in which the King of Pop told how important it was to him that his planned comeback concerts at London's O2 Arena were a triumph.

'Elvis didn't do it. Beatles didn't do it. We have to be phenomenal. When people leave the show, when people leave my show, I want them to say, "I've never seen nothing like this in my life",' he said.

He said he wanted his fans to hail him as 'the greatest entertainer in the world.'

On trial: Dr. Conrad Murray, seen here in court on Wednesday, recorded Jackson rambling about his life and career using an iPhone weeks before the singer's death

The recording was made by Jackson's personal doctor, Conrad Murray, on his iPhone using an iTalk application and prosecutors claim it was taped while the star was under the influence of the hospital anaesthetic Propofol.

'My performances will be up there helping my children. I love them I love them because I didn't have a childhood. I had no childhood.

'I feel their pain. I feel their hurt. I can deal with it,' Jackson said in a slow, faltering tone much different to the star's famously high voice.

'Heal the World, We Are the World, Will You Be There, The Lost Children. These are the songs I have written because I hurt, you know, I hurt,' he added.

FOR HIS CHILDREN: In the recordings Jackson says he loves his kids, pictured here this week, as he did not have a childhood and that he wants to be remembered as the greatest entertainer of all time

The recording was played during the 
testimony of Drug Enforcement Agency forensic computer expert Stephen 
Marx, who analysed data on Murray's iPhone. It was recorded on May 10, 
2009 - just six weeks before Jackson's death.

Jackson told how he planned to take the millions he would make with his 'This Is It' tour to build the 'biggest children's hospital in the world' with a game room and a move theatre.

Prosecutors claim Murray taped Jackson after sedating him with Propofol, but defense lawyers claim it would have put him to sleep immediately and he'd been given a milder sedative

'Children are depressed in those hospitals because there is no game room, no movie theatre. They're sick because they're depressed.

'Their mind is depressing them. I care about them, them angels. God wants me to do it. I'm going to do it, Conrad,' he adds.

The lights were dimmed in the courtroom while the recording - a snippet of which was heard during the prosecution's opening statement - was played in full.

'Don't have enough hope, no more hope,' he said. 'That's the real generation that's going to save our planet, starting with, we'll talk about it - United States, Europe, Prague.

'My babies. They walk around with no mother. They drop them off, they leave - a psychological degradation of that. They reach out to me - please take me with you.

'I want to do it for them. That will be remembered more than my performances. My performances will be up there helping my children and always be my dream.'

Asked by Murray if he was okay, Jackson says: 'I am asleep.'

Murray, 58, has pleaded not guilty to causing Jackson's death on June 25, 2009, by administering him with a fatal dose of powerful Propofol, which is only supposed to be used in a hospital setting.

If he is convicted of involuntary manslaughter, Murray could be jailed for up to four years.

Prosecutors claim Murray taped Jackson's voice after sedating him with Propofol to help him sleep, but defense lawyers claim the drug would have put the star to sleep immediately and say the doctor had given him a milder sedative.

Later on Wednesday coroner's investigator Fleak told the court how she discovered bottles of Propofol - the powerful anaesthetic that killed Michael Jackson - hidden away in bags she found in a cupboard in the star's bedroom.

She also found an empty vial of the drug on the floor by the bed and an array of different sedatives and prescription painkillers in medicine bottles bearing the name of the star and an alias he is know to have used.

The drugs were found in two searches of the singer's Los Angeles mansion within days of the tragedy.

Miss Fleak, who works for the Los Angeles County Coroner, said she examined Jackson's body after he was taken to hospital to see if she could determine any obvious cause of death.

She took a number of photos of the star - including one shown on the opening day of the trial - but said she was unable to see what caused Jackson's collapse.

She testified that she also found medical equipment, including oxygen bottles, IV containers, syringes and a jug or urine in Jackson's bedroom.

The case continues.
