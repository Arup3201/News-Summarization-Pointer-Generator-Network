A puppy called Penny could be
reunited with her worry-stricken U.S. owners by week's end after
she went on a nearly 2,400-mile road trip that took her to an
Iowa truck stop and a Pennsylvania pet hospital, her family said
on Tuesday.

The floppy-eared Vizsla has one more stop before returning
home to Washington state. 

She has to travel from Pennsylvania,
where she has been in foster care, to the District of Columbia
for a free ride home from U.S. carrier Alaska Airlines, her
owners said in a message on Saturday on a Facebook page devoted
to finding her.

Homecoming: A puppy called Penny traveled 2,400 across the country but may be reunited with her owners in Washington state by week's end 

Adventure: Penny traveled 2,400 miles across the United States from Washington state all the way to Pennsylvania 

Journey: The dog's trip  began on December 19 when she got loose from her owners and a truck driver picked her up while she was wandering in her hometown of Royal City, her owners said on Facebook 

'It's pretty crazy. We were very worried,' Kendra Brown, Penny's owner, told Pittsburgh broadcaster WPXI this week.

Brown continued 'We originally thought that she probably ran off and wasn't going to make it, um, so once we heard she was alive we were very grateful, and then since when we lost her now we've found her again. 

'So I mean - if she could talk, I'd bet that she'd quite a few adventures that she could talk about.' 

Penny's cross-country voyage began on December 19 when she got
loose from her owners and a truck driver picked her up while she
was wandering in her hometown of Royal City, a tiny community in
eastern Washington, her owners said on Facebook.

'We were able to track him down and when he found out we
knew he had her, he dropped her off at a truck stop in Des
Moines, Iowa,' her family said. 

Discovery: Already some 1,600 miles from home, Penny somehow ended up days later in the care of a veterinarian at a pet hospital in West Township, Pennsylvania, a Facebook message on December 24 said

Already some 1,600 miles from home, Penny somehow ended up
days later in the care of a veterinarian at a pet hospital in
West Township, Pennsylvania, a Facebook message on December 24 said. 

Banfield
Pet Hospital confirmed Penny's Washington state roots by
scanning the dog's micro chip, a spokeswoman said.

The dog has been staying in foster care and the family hopes
to have her back in Washington by the end of the week, they said in a  message on Penny's Facebook page.

Alaska Airlines said it learned about the dog on December 26 and
is 'flying Penny home complimentary' from a District of Columbia
area airport to Seattle on January 2, a spokeswoman said. 

Speaking to Daily Mail Online, Brown said she and her husband Colt discovered Penny was with the trucker on December 22 - and just two days later learned that their pooch arrived in Pennsylvania.

Brown said that the couple was 'extremely happy [to learn that Penny] was safe and okay.'

However, Brown said 'it was very frustrating' to not be on the same side of the country as Penny or know anyone in the area - 2,400 miles away from the couple's home.

Brown said that Penny is being sent back home Friday evening with the help of volunteers - and that she and her husband will pick Penny up after she lands in Seattle.
