Drifting on the surface of the ocean, jellyfish-like creatures called Portuguese man o' war are feared by swimmers and surfers because of their painful stings.

But one photographer has braved numerous agonising encounters to capture these beautiful creatures on film.

Taken at the waterline, the photographs show the siphonophore’s luminious tentacles glowing brightly beneath the waves.

Matthew Smith, originally from Newark in Nottinghamshire, was attracted to the creatures, also known as bluebottles, because of their vivid colouring.

Found in tropical and subtropical waters, the bluebottles live at the water’s surface and because they have no means of propulsion, and are carried along by currents, winds and tides.

However, they are far from helpless because their tentacles deliver a painful sting.

The Portuguese man o' war is a carnivore. Using its venomous tentacles (pictured) it  traps and paralyzes its prey. It typically feeds upon small marine organisms, such as fish and plankton, but is itself eaten by loggerhead turtles and the blanket octopus, for example

Bioluminescence is the production and emission of light by a living organism.

It occurs widely in marine vertebrates and invertebrates, as well as in some fungi and microorganisms such as phytoplankton.

The word comes from the Greek 'bios' for living and the Latin 'lumen' for light.

Bioluminescence is a type of light energy produced by a chemical reaction.

Different types of animals use bioluminescence in different ways.

Deep sea squid use it for counter illumination camouflage so they match their environmental light, but Anglefish use it to lure prey with a light-up dangling appendage from their head that draws in smaller fish, which they can eat.

Fireflies use bioluminescence to attract mates by flashing their abdomens, while their larvae use it to repel predators.

On numerous occasions the alien-like marine creatures wrapped their tentacles around Mr Smith’s wrist and neck, which were not covered by his wetsuit.

He spent the last 12 months at Bass Point Cove in New South Wales, Australia, photographing the Bluebottles.

Mr Smith, 38, used an 'over-underwater' technique with a waterproof lens dome he made himself.

In order to get highlight the glowing effect of the bluebottles he used an underwater flash gun.

The bluebottles appear to light up because of a natural process called bioluminescence.

Bioluminescence is also the reason why sea waves to light up neon-blue at night.

Tiny plankton are disturbed, causing them to emit light though a complex chemical reaction.

Organisms such as plankton, jellyfish and anglerfish are able to glow by releasing the chemical luciferin, which reacts with oxygen to create light.

While some fish use their light to lure prey, it’s thought that jellyfish and siphonophores glow as a defence against predators. 

For example, comb jellyfish flash brightly to startle attachers, while siphonophores such as bluebottles either display a chain of light or release thousands of glowing particles into the water in order to confuse predators.

In the bluebottle’s case, it may draw attention to its venomous tentacles to scare off hungry loggerhead turtles, or equally lure small fish, which it traps and paralyses with its fronds. 

Dr Andy Davies, a marine biologist at Bangor University's School of Ocean Sciences, explained: 'Bioluminescence occurs widely among some groups of animals, especially in the open sea and in insects.

‘Most marine light-emission is in the blue and green light spectrum - the wavelengths that pass furthest through seawater,’ he said.

‘However, some loose-jawed fish emit red and infrared light, and the genus Tomopteris emits yellow light.

‘Sometimes thousands of square miles of the ocean shine with the light of bioluminescent bacteria in the milky seas.'

Mr Smith said: ‘What you don't see in the still image is the constantly changing dynamics of what's going on.

‘The ocean is surging back and forth, the wind is blowing and these guys are perfect sailors - they motor along in the slightest breeze.

‘I'm also trying to frame all this up whilst treading water or swimming alongside trying not to get stung. It can be frustrating at the best of times.’

Describing what it feels like to be stung by bluebottles, Mr Smith said: ‘The stings start out like an electric shock feeling, followed by a stinging, tingling sensation which then dulls to muscle numbness around the area after an hour or two.

‘The numbness lasts the rest of the day and too many stings can be potentially dangerous so I do my best to minimise it.

‘I guess they do say you have to suffer for your art.’
