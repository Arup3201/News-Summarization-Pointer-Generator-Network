Everton's week started with two old stars being made ambassadors for the loyal service they had given the club. Appropriately, then, it ended with a current player showing why he will deserve similar recognition in years to come.

If Everton chairman Bill Kenwright has a special place in his affections for Ian Snodin and Graham Stuart — those who were given ambassadorial roles — the same must be true of Leon Osman, who recorded his 400th appearance on Saturday.

Man-of-the-Match: Leon Osman

Osman, 33, is not someone who courts the limelight but he took centre stage when his late goal settled a tempestuous clash with West Ham United and allowed the momentum to continue to build in Everton’s campaign.

Manager Roberto Martinez described it as Everton’s ‘most satisfying win’ so far. He was content. Sam Allardyce, however, was anything but and it had nothing to do with being held up from speaking to the press by the loquacious Spaniard.

Allardyce was simmering over what he regarded as an offside goal from Romelu Lukaku and poor defending in the build-up to Osman’s winner meant West Ham had nothing to show for their efforts. Mauro Zarate’s 55th-minute strike was no consolation.

‘It is hugely disappointing,’ Allardyce grumbled. ‘We tried to get the second goal and one punt up the middle is a hugely disappointing way to concede. Everton had four shots on target but they didn’t create a lot else. We have lost because of that and referee’s decision.’

With Alex Song, Enner Valencia, Diafra Sakho and Stewart Downing all injured, West Ham were stripped of four key men who have contributed to the side’s impressive start.

Starting for the first time this season, though, was Andy Carroll — a significantly leaner Carroll — and he made an immediate impact, playing a magnificent sweeping ball to set Morgan Amalfitano free to create the game’s first chance.

That scare jolted Everton into life and they began to impose themselves, with James McCarthy and Osman central to everything they did. West Ham played with a back five but they were never entirely comfortable. Osman was involved in Everton’s opener as was Steven Naismith, who would later succumb to hamstring damage, and after they combined, Ross Barkley’s shot cannoned off Winston Reid into the path of Lukaku, who swept his shot beyond Adrian. Was he offside?

‘I have been to see the referee,’ said Allardyce. ‘I will keep what I said to myself.

West Ham were sharper out of the blocks in the second half and restored parity when Zarate exchanged passes with Amalfitano to unleash a shot that struck Phil Jagielka’s heel and looped over Tim Howard. 

The game continued to be spiky and James Tomkins was booked by Mark Clattenburg for a preposterous reaction to a shove from Kevin Mirallas, who was also booked. It was one of many excellent decisions, the best of which came in the 74th minute.

A stricter referee would have halted play when James Collins upended Lukaku but Clattenburg allowed the move to continue and substitute Samuel Eto’o sped away to provide a cross for Osman, who gleefully finished.

‘Leon was outstanding,’ said Martinez. ‘His role was marshalling the back four, so he was the last player you expected to see at the end of the counter-attack was him. But that sums him up. He gets the winning goal in a fitting performance.

‘He’s an incredible ambassador for this club.’
