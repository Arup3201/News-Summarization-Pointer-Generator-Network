A Chinese woman has spoken about giving birth to IVF twins and becoming the country's oldest mother at 60.

Sheng Hailin decided that she wanted to become a mother again after her daughter, 29, was killed by carbon monoxide poisoning in 2009.

In a rare move for the country which enforces a one child policy, a military hospital in Heifei agreed to to give Mrs Hailin and her husband IVF treatment.

The twins' father Wu Jingzhou carries his daughters after his sixty-year-old wife, gave birth in 2010

In 2010 she gave birth to daughters Zhizhi and Huihui who are now aged three.

Mrs Hailin said that she and her husband wanted to have the twins to 'survive and free myself from the loneliness.'

But because of the arrivals instead of preparing for retirement Mrs Hailin has had to increase her work schedule, and complained that she does not get to spend as much time with her young family as she would like.

She told the China Daily: 'For the baby girls, I have given out all I have.'

The mother, who works as a health lecturer, added: 'Some lectures may only last one day, but sometimes I have to stay three or four days in one place.

'I could only spend four or five days at home with my children in a month. I'm 64 now and my body is old.'

In November this year, the Chinese government announced couples could have two children if one parent is an only child.

An estimated one million families in the country have lost their sole descendant since the one child policy took effect in the late 1970s, and another four to seven million are expected to do so in the next 20 to 30 years.

Such families face uncertain futures, with no one to help them through old age in a country which emphasises family life.
