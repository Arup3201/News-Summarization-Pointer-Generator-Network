He may be a big fish in the Westminster Bubble but Boris Johnson had his ego well and truly pricked when he ventured outside it yesterday.

The London Mayor – on a six-day tour of India – found himself being confused with the German tennis hero Boris Becker.

At an event in Mumbai which saw the handing over of petals from the Olympic Cauldron to Indian  athletes, the Old Etonian was asked if he was the red-haired Wimbledon legend.

Different ball game: The London Mayor, playing cricket here, was also mistaken for former tennis player Boris Becker

Not out: Mr Johnson was lucky not to have any wickets to defend as he faced tricky balls from Delhi school children

Akash Bharadia, an 18-year-old on a 
gap year volunteering at the temple, said: 'One of the locals shouted 
out it was Boris Becker while some people asked whether he was the King 
of England.

'They know it's Boris, that's the main thing.'

Perhaps the locals could be forgiven 
for getting mixed up - Mr Johnson was given a royal welcome as he was 
shown in to the inner sanctum of relics from Bhagwan Swaminarayan, a 
figure believed by Hindus to be God's incarnation on earth.

Mr Bharadia explained: 'I have never seen someone allowed in there before. It's only usually VVIPs such as the Queen.'

The locals weren't the only ones who were unsure of his role.

An American businessman who had his 
photo taken with Mr Johnson referred to him as 'that guy on the zip 
line', referring to when he got stuck while travelling over 
Victoria Park at the Olympic Games.

Plan: Mr Johnson wants to use the trip to boost business links with the subcontinent

After his visit to the temple he went on a log flume ride which featured a narration of the history of India.

He then nearly missed a round of interviews after officials sat him down to view a 45-minute film on Hinduism.

Mr Johnson did take time out to back Prime Minister David Cameron's stance 
against a referendum on whether Britain should remain a member of the 
European Union.

Ambitions: Mr Johnson also wants to sort out issues over student visas while abroad

He said Mr Cameron should concentrate on repatriating powers from
the European Union rather than holding a vote on whether we should 
remain in the bloc.

He 
said the question was not worth considering, because even if the UK did 
leave Europe, we would still have to maintain an enormous staff in 
Brussels.

Mr Johnson arrived in Delhi at the start of the tour which will also take in Hyderabad and Mumbai 
and aims to confront UK visa system problems which limit Indian students
from coming to the UK to study and to pick up tips on how to develop 
infrastructure.

An aside: Mr Johnson's backing for David Cameron over an EU referendum will be one less headache for the Prime Minister

The Akshardham Hindu temple he visited is a sister temple 
to the Neasden Temple in north west London.

On Monday he showed off his cricketing prowess, facing a young bowler from a 
school in Delhi before presenting two London 2012 Olympic cauldron 
petals to Indian Olympians.

He will also meet up with the England
cricket team, in the country for a test series, appear on a high 
profile television chat show, and visit the Bollywood film studios.

Mr Cameron has suggested there could 
be a referendum on Britain’s relationship with the EU - but only after 
the eurozone crisis has played out.

Mr Johnson argued that Britain was 
better off in the EU because it had a seat at the table deciding the 
rules under which the single market - which is valuable for the UK - 
operates.

His surprise 
intervention comes days after an EU summit collapsed in acrimony after 
failing to agree on a seven-year budget deal. 

Mr Cameron had argued that there should 
be no real-term rise in the budget, at a time when member states are 
having to make tough cuts to public services.

Yesterday, Foreign Secretary William Hague repeated the government’s position that now is not the time for an in-out referendum.

But
last year, more than 80 Conservative MPs defied the Prime Minister and 
voted in favour of a referendum on our future in Europe.

Mr Johnson was asked whether he agreed with the calls during an appearance on Pienaar’s Politics show on BBC Radio Five Live.

Mr Johnson said: ‘I don’t think it’s as simple as yes, no, in, out.

‘Suppose
Britain voted tomorrow to come out. What would actually happen? In real
terms, what would happen is that the Foreign Office’s entire delegation
would remain in Brussels.

‘UKREP would remain there, we’d still 
have huge numbers of staff trying to monitor what was going on in the 
community, only we wouldn’t be able to sit in the Council of Ministers. 
We wouldn’t have any vote at all. Now I don’t think that’s actually a 
prospect that’s likely to appeal.’ 

The Mayor said it was better to 
renegotiate our relationship with Europe, so we got a better deal which 
returned powers to Westminster.

‘What you could do, is think of a new 
arrangement, new areas of the treaty that we didn’t want to participate 
in any more,’ he said. ‘That is the where people are thinking now.

‘With great respect to the sort of in-outers, I don’t think it does boil down to such a simple question.’

On call: Mr Johnson took time out from his India trip to support Prime Minister David Cameron's stance on a referendum on whether Britain should remain a member of the EU

Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr 
show, Foreign Secretary William Hague said the Government would offer a 
referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU after the end of the 
Eurozone crisis and negotiations on repatriation of powers.

‘The
Prime Minister and I have set out our position on this, and he will 
speak further about it at the appropriate time,’ he said.

‘We’ve
said enormous changes are happening in Europe, partly because of the 
crisis in the eurozone that may change the relationship between the 
countries of the European Union. We’ve also said we want to improve our 
relationship with Europe.

‘Of course at the last general election we stood in the Conservative party on returning some powers to the United Kingdom.

‘We
do believe that sometimes less is more in Europe; that doing less at 
the European level is better for this county and for other countries, 
and what we’ve said is that when we see how that crisis in the eurozone 
plays out and when we’ve tried to improve our relationship with Europe, 
well that will be the time to seek fresh consent from the British people
and the cleanest and clearest way of doing that would be in a 
referendum.

‘But we 
will spell out our policy for the coming years and for the next general 
election when the Prime Minister speaks about these things.’

Meet and greet: The Mayor of London will visit Delhi, Hyderabad and Mumbai and will boost his celebrity status by appearing on a high-profile television chat show and visiting Bollywood film studios

On business: Mr Johnson will party with the England cricket team, in India for a Test series

On Friday, an EU summit in Brussels collapsed after the 27 members failed to agree on the budget for the next seven years.

Mr Cameron accused the EU of existing in a ‘parallel universe’ and ‘insulting taxpayers’ by refusing to cut ‘a single euro’ from their spending plans.

Influential backbencher Mark Pritchard, a former secretary of the 1922 Committee of Tory MPs, urged ministers to bring forward legislation for a referendum before the end of the parliament.

‘This should be an in/out referendum - anything short of that simply won’t deliver,’ he said in an article for the Telegraph website.
