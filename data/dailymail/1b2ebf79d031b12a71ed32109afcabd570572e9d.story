A map of many colors shows who America is rooting for, by region, in the NCAA men's basketball tournament.

Facebook has mapped out the national sentiment for the 68 teams competing for the championship, based on more than one million Facebook users who Liked one of the participating college basketball teams on the social media website.

The colorful map shows the allegiances in 3,140 counties in the U.S. and the data was split various ways to show team spirit nationally, by the four divisions and by state rivalries.

Madness: Facebook mapped out NCAA team loyalties by Likes on the social media website. Over 1 million U.S. Facebook users have Liked a page for one of the 68 teams in the tournament. Poor Texas, no school in the Lone Star state made it this year leaving Texans unsure of who to root for

Most teams posted a strong showing in 
their home state. Gonzaga, located in Spokane, Washington, is the crowd 
favorite in the Pacific Northwest.

In the Midwest there is absolute 
loyalty for the teams in Minnesota, Illinois and Indiana, it is the home of the Hoosiers after 
all. Even President Obama, whose roots are in Illinois, picked Indiana 
as the champion for 2013 in his NCAA bracket.

Sadly, the Lone Star state seemed 
confused on who to root for. With no Texas teams in the tournament, the 
state was a smorgasbord of Likes for random teams, with residents unable
to throw their support behind any home team. Undoubtedly, if the Aggies had progressed into the tournament - the state would be a solid maroon.

Some users cried foul, though, for the 
map's portrayal of the strong support for the UNC Tar Heels in North 
Carolina, with only a tiny show of support in North Carolina for Coach 
K's Duke. There were only three small specks of dark blue representing 
fans of the Blue Devils.

1 Seeds: Of the the four #1 seeds, Indiana and Kansas seem to pull the most supporters while Gonzaga and Louisvillle fans are pretty much clustered in their regions

In the separately created maps for the four divisions competing for the NCAA title, Duke was redeemed.

Among the 18 teams playing the Midwest Division, much of the country is rooting for the private school in Durham.

In the map portraying favorites in the South Division, of 16 teams, Duke's rival UNC stole the show. Much of the Plain is rooting for the Kansas Jayhawks and Minnesota also showed strong support for the Minnesota Golden Gophers.

The Wild West lived up to its name, the map for the 17 states in this division shows no clear frontrunner though Gonzaga certainly charmed a large percentage of Facebook fans.Â 

East Coasters are loving the Hoosiers, with the exception of New York, who showed unquestioning loyalty to Syracuse.

Midwest: Of the 18 teams competing in this division, Duke is the favorite by far though Kentucky favors Louisville and Oklahoma roots for the home team

South: There is clearly a deep love for the Tar Heels in this division, though fans of Minnesota, Kansas and Michigan proudly support their teams. South Dakota State and Northwestern State deserve sympathy though, not even one Like!

West: The Pacific Northwest goes hard for Gonzaga while most of the other 17 teams in the division are feeling the love in their home states

East: The Hoosiers have widespread appeal among the 17 teams in the East division but fans of Syracuse and Illinois aren't afraid to show their true support

The data was also spliced to show national Likes by rivalries.

Down south in North Carolina, the Duke-UNC competition is among the fiercest but again UNC has won the hearts and minds of the nation.

Similarly there was a clear favorite in the University of Kansas and Kansas Sate rivalry, with the UK Jayhawks coming out as the clear favorite.

March Madness kicked off on Thursday and Americans are intensely watching the college basketball teams face off to monitor how they will fare in their NCAA Tournament Brackets.

Millions of Americans will fill out a bracket to predict the outcome of the games, though a scientist at Georgia Tech has calculated that a person's chances of perfectly predicting the correct outcome to all 68 games is 1 in 9,223,372,036,854,775,808 (9 quintillion).

Though the odds are really not in a person's favor, that doesn't stop people from putting money where their mouth is. Estimates suggest as much as $3 billion could change hands in office betting pools.

These colors don't bleed: There must be something in the water in North Carolina. Between Duke (dark blue) and North Carolina (light blue), UNC is the national favorite

We're not in Kansas anymore: No question, the KU Jayhawks (blue) are the national favorite among this rivalry. Sorry Kansas State, don't mean to kick a man when he's down (K-State lost to La Salle on Friday and had to kiss their dream of advancing in the tournament goodbye)

Great Lake State: University of Michigan (yellow) pretty much dominated Michigan State (green) in terms of support
