Dozens of loaded firearms, inert military grenades, a mobile phone disguised as a stun gun and a tiny lipstick knife were among the prohibited items seized from travellers at US airports last month.

In the latest round-up on its blog, the Transportation Security Administration announced that it had confiscated 196 guns at security checkpoints in October.

Almost all of the firearms - 171 in total - were loaded and over a dozen had rounds chambered.

Virtually all cases involve a pistol-packing passenger who had no ill intent and forgot to remove the firearm from their hand luggage before it was submitted for screening.

But even forgetful passengers risk being arrested and assessed a penalty of $7,500 (nearly £5,000). 

In addition to guns, TSA agents continue to find inert or replica grenades and other weaponry in passengers’ luggage on a weekly basis, despite repeated warnings.

Last week alone they seized ammunition, a cane sword, a box cutter blade concealed in the lining of a carry-on bag in Boston, 16 stun guns and four inert or realistic replica grenades at airports in Atlanta, New Orleans, Des Moines, Iowa, and Springfield, Missouri.

And it appears many travellers are unaware that novelty items that look like bombs or grenades are also prohibited. The discovery of such items can lead to significant delays because bomb experts must be brought in to make sure the objects do not pose a threat.

Earlier this month a passenger at Honolulu’s airport checked a bag containing a military training kit with inert C-4 explosives, blasting caps, detonators and a detonating cord.

The airport’s baggage room had to be evacuated while bomb experts inspected the kit, resulting in a delay for screening.

One of the more unusual items to be discovered by TSA officers was an unloaded cannon barrel at Kahului Airport in Hawaii.

Last week, 34 of 41 guns seized at American airports were loaded, according to the TSA

In its blog, the TSA urged passengers to leave the items at home to avoid being arrested or causing delays.

The government agency said: ‘Just because we find a prohibited item on an individual does not mean they had bad intentions, that's for the law enforcement officer to decide.

'In many cases, people simply forgot they had these items.'
