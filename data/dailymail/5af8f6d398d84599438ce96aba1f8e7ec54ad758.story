How many rights would you be willing to relinquish in order to sing to the back of a chair?

A leaked legal document that contestants of The Voice must sign in order to appear on the TV talent show has exposed the production's potential for distortion and the umbrella of power NBC ensures it has.

The 32-page contract was obtained by the NY Daily News and details how producers can cut anyone from the line-up, break and change rules of the competition at their discretion, script winners and send the singing hopefuls for medical and/or psychological tests and broacast the results.

One clause also reportedly says they can ignore the show's voting system in 'the event of problems'.

Fine print: The contract that The Voice contestants are forced to sign has revealed what little rights they have when appearing on the show, which this year features the new judging panel of (L-R) Shakira, Usher, Adam Levine and Blake Shelton

Previously: (L-R) Blake Shelton, Christina Aguilera, Cee Lo Green and Adam Levine have been the staple 'coaches' of the series, which is now its sixth season

Another warns contestants the show 'may be disparaging, defamatory, embarrassing (and) may expose [them] to public ridicule, humiliation or condemnation'.

It also warns they could 'portray [them] in a false light'.

The cast-iron contract has been drafted so that none of the fledgling reality stars that enter the show can sue NBC afterwards.

'The second clause of this document says to contestants, ''F--k you'',' a legal expert told the NY Daily News of the contract.

'And if you missed it, the clauses that follow say, ''F--k you''.'

NBC and the show's producers have denied that any manipulation occurs in the making of the show, such as changing the voting counts, and say that such clauses are precautionary.

However it has helped explain the surprise and somewhat controversial elimination of viewer favorite Judith Hill last season.

Hill, who was chosen to sign a due with Michael Jackson during ill-fated This Is It tour and went on to sign at his memorial, was considered an early frontrunner.

However she was cut during a random upset, along with fellow contestant Sarah Simmons.

In another episode last May, producers were forced to admit they had discarded thousands of votes cast via social media and text.

The admission came after Telescope, the outside company that monitors the votes, found 'some inconsistencies'.

'For complete fairness, votes cast via text and online were not counted in the voting results,' host Carson Daly said at the time.

'We value our relationship with our viewers.

But, bizarrely, the then added: 'Telescope certifies that removing those votes did not affect the outcome for any team.'

AN NBC representative would not elaborate on the contracts being made public.

The talent search series, hosted by Carson Daly, says the cast-iron contracts are routine for reality television

'The integrity of our competition shows, including ‘The Voice,’ is of the utmost importance to NBC,' the rep said.

One legal expert thick document is 'smartly written' and there is nothing untoward in the contract, despite the way it may sound.

'These kinds of shows have been around for a while and ... have been sued or threatened with lawsuits quite a bit,' the expert said.

'Tough language is standard now in the industry.'

The Voice is now its six season and this year features Shakira, Usher, Adam Levine and Blake Shelton as coaches.

Typically Levine and Shelton are joined by Christina Aguilera and CeeLo Green.

It debuted this year to an audience of 15.74 million viewers.
