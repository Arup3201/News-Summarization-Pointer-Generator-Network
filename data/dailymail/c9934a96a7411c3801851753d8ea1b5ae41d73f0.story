As Joe Biden and Paul Ryan tore into each other over chewy topics like Iran and tax during last night's TV debate, there was only one subject preoccupying tens of thousands of viewers - the Vice President's glaring toothy grin.

Within minutes of the debate starting, Twitter was abuzz with users taken aback by Biden's behaviour and sent out mocking messages. 

One parodied his a trademark soundbite: 'For those brief moments you don't see a #BidenSmirk on my face, know that I've got a #BidenSmirk in my heart.'

Hilarity: Joe Biden smirked his way through the vice-presidential debate in Danville, Kentucky

Mocking: Biden was repeatedly seen laughing at what he considered his opponent's missteps

One mischievous feed, 'LaughinJoeBiden', simply tweeted a series of messages reading 'lol', 'lmao' and 'teeheehehe'.

While his smile was dismissed as patronising Ryan, his teeth could have been part of a shock and awe tactic on his opponent. 

Catrise Austin, a 'dentist to the stars' based in New York City, told MailOnline she thought Biden had been fitted with either a full set of porcelain veneers or a porcelain bridge, at an estimated cost of around $20,000.

GOP operatives used the Twitter hashtag '#BidenUnhinged' to mock the Vice President's exuberant performance.

The Republican National Committee posted an online campaign ad overnight featuring a full minute of him laughing followed by the message, 'Vice President Biden is laughing... are you?'

Some compared Biden's laughter to Al Gore's notorious sighs in the 2000 presidential debates, a mannerism which many voters felt made him look unprofessional.

'That condescending, smirking, laughing - it was akin to Gore's sigh,' Republican strategist Mary Matalin told CNN.

Ari Fleischer, former press secretary for George W. Bush, tweeted: 'Biden is at risk of having his laugh come across like Gore's sighs. He should knock it off.'

Fool: Biden annoyed many for constantly interrupting Ryan while others quoted the Bible to mock the VP

Even some Democratic supporters 
criticised the behaviour, such as liberal film critic Roger Ebert, who 
tweeted: 'Joe! Stop smiling and laughing!'

But other Biden fans were pleased with their man's performance - strategist Hillary Rosen said, 'I think he genuinely thought that Ryan’s attempts to nitpick and cast aspersions on the administration’s foreign policy was laughable.'

Body language experts were unimpressed by the grinning.

Lillian Glass, author of an upcoming book on the practice, said: 'That mugging, those condescending looks - it was a complete turnoff. He was bullying, he was smug, he interrupted... I think he lost a lot of his message based on facial gestures.'
