Almost 50,000 prisoners detained by Gaddafi's regime are missing amid fears that many are trapped in secret bunkers abandoned by their captors.

Rebel leaders estimate that 60,000 opponents of the tyrant have been locked up since the insurgency began in February, but only 11,000 were freed.

Many are believed to have been slaughtered in mass executions of opposition fighters and their supporters by retreating Gaddafi loyalists.

Others are believed to be still alive 
but left to starve in underground chambers which the dictator's forces 
have deserted since the fall of Tripoli.

Rebels and humanitarian groups are racing against time to locate the bunkers and release the captives.

Gaddafi fighters captured tens of thousands of rebels and their supporters during the battle for Benghazi and other cities.

Thousands more civilians accused of 
backing the rebels were detained in a series of security crackdowns as 
Gaddafi desperately tried to stop the revolution spreading to Tripoli.

Col Ahmed Omar Bani, a rebel military 
leader, said: ‘The number of people arrested over the past months is 
estimated at between 57,000 and 60,000.

‘Between 10,000 and 11,000 prisoners have been freed up until now ... so where are the others?’

He added: ‘Many people in Tripoli are now discovering mass graves around former detention centres and the prison in Abu Slim.

‘We have names of individuals who 
know what happened with the prisoners in Tripoli and these individuals 
are currently being sought by our liberation forces. We invite anyone 
who has information on prisoners to come forward.’

A dismayed Col Bani said it would be ‘catastrophic’ if they had been murdered.

In action: The RAF Sentinel R1 aircraft has been called in to try and pinpoint the whereabouts of Gaddafi and his family

Foreign Secretary William Hague has described Colonel Gaddafi as 
'delusional' as rumours circulate that the dictator has fled to Algeria

Meanwhile, Britain stepped up the hunt for Colonel Gaddafi yesterday as mystery continued to surround his whereabouts.

RAF
 spy planes, crack SAS troops and MI6 intelligence experts all joined 
the search for the tyrant amid rumours that he had fled Libya.

Speculation that he had escaped into 
Algeria began after a convoy of six armoured Mercedes cars crossed the 
border near the southern town of Ghadames.

Ministers in Algiers were forced to deny that he had sought shelter in their country.

There were also rumours that Gaddafi 
would seek sanctuary with one of two other despots, Robert Mugabe in 
Zimbabwe or Hugo Chavez in Venezuela, and that some members of his 
family had gone to Europe.

However, Gaddafi’s spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said  the toppled leader was still  in Libya.

In
 a phone call to the Associated Press news agency in New York, he  said 
Gaddafi was ready to begin talks to hand power to the rebels.

Negotiations would be led by Gaddafi’s son, Saadi, who said he wanted to prevent Tripoli becoming ‘a sea of blood’.

Foreign Secretary William Hague 
described the ousted dictator as ‘delusional’ and the National 
Transitional Council, the rebel government, rejected the offer and said 
he was a criminal who would be put on trial if captured.

Gaddafi loyalists are continuing to fight the insurgents – particularly around Gaddafi’s home town of Sirte.

Some rebel commanders believe Gaddafi and his inner circle have fled there as it is his last pocket of support in Libya.

Pro-democracy leaders are holding negotiations with Sirte’s elders to 
try to force a peaceful surrender of the town, which would be a huge 
symbolic victory, but so far have failed to broker a deal.

Crack soldiers from 22 SAS are understood to be operating in Sirte to help prise the town from the regime’s clutches.

The RAF’s Sentinel R1  surveillance aircraft is being used to try to pinpoint Gaddafi and his family moving around the country.

The aircraft is kitted out with radar and eavesdropping equipment so sensitive that it can intercept mobile phone calls.

Tornado and Typhoon fighter jets are also on standby to attack the dictator’s bunkers and hideouts.

Experts believe Gaddafi will lie low and avoid armoured or large convoys which could be spotted by spy planes. He is also likely to avoid using phones in case intelligence agencies detect his voice patterns.
