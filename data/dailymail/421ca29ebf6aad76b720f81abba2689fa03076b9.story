Police are  behind in the search for a 23-year-old woman who wasn't reported missing until four days after her disappearance.

Christina Morris, 23, of Plano, Texas, was last seen on August 30, walking with a male friend into a mall shopping garage, but she never drove out. 

She wasn't reported missing though until September 3, when she failed to show up to work and her boss got worried. 

Missing: Christina Morris, 23, went missing last Saturday after attending a party at a friend's house. She was last seen walking into a parking garage at 4am that day. On the left is the last picture taken of her

Morris lives with her boyfriend, who failed to report her missing, her parents Ronnie and Jonnie McElroy said. 

Police are now enlisting the public's help in the search, after releasing surveillance footage showing her entering The Shops at Legacy parking garage around 4am Saturday with a male friend. 

She had been hanging out at a friend's house just previously.  

Piece of the puzzle: Police released this surveillance footage showing her entering a parking garage with a close male friend around 4am Saturday. She was not recorded leaving the garage

Scene: Above, the Shops at Legacy, where Morris was last seen with her close friend. The male friend she was walking with is not considered a suspect in her disappearance 

Morris lives with her boyfriend, but he didn't report her missing until four days later when she didn't show up for work and her boss called. Morris pictured left in a picture with an unidentified man, posted to her Facebook 

The close friend she was seen walking with has been questioned and police do not consider him a suspect in the disappearance. 

'He goes to the right to his car. He gets in his car and he leaves,' Officer David Tilley, a Plano Police spokesperson, told CBS Dallas/Fort Worth. 'She went the other way. From there, we don’t really know what happened.'

Morris' bank accounts have not been accessed and her cell phone is turned off or dead. The last 15 calls were to her boyfriend. And police say there was no sign of foul play or a struggle near her car. 

This week, her parents organized a search of the area around the shopping mall, but it turned up no new evidence.  

'We can’t sleep,' Mrs McElroy said. 'I have two different visions… in one vision I see her smile, I feel her touch. And I also vision the worst. And I don’t like that at all.'

'If my daughter is alive out there, somebody knows.' 

Morris is described as 5-foot-4, 100 pounds with brown eyes and blonde hair.  

Looking: Mother Jonni McElroy organized a search of the area around the shopping mall this past week
