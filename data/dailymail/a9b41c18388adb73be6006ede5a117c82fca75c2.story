Luis Suarez has told his Liverpool team-mates he plans to stay at Anfield and lead next season’s pursuit of the Barclays Premier League title. 

Liverpool on Monday said that manager Brendan Rodgers had signed a new contract that runs until 2018, and he will be boosted by Suarez’s presence.  

Reports say Real Madrid are poised to table a £100million offer for Suarez, who signed a lucrative long-term deal at Liverpool in December, when he promised to stay at the club ‘for a very long time’.

His tears 
at Crystal Palace, after a 3-3 draw that all but ended Liverpool’s title
 challenge were seen as a sign that Suarez felt his one chance to 
deliver the Premier League crown to Liverpool had gone.

But
 sources at the Bernabeu insist there will be no offer for Suarez if 
Karim Benzema agrees a new deal. The France striker, believed to be a 
target for Arsenal, is demanding a huge pay rise but the European 
champions are hopeful of reaching an agreement with the 26-year-old 
before the World Cup.

Anfield 
insiders insist Suarez was committed to staying, with Champions League 
football on offer next season as well as another tilt at the title.  

Sportsmail understands Suarez and his wife have even enrolled their daughter at a new school in the area.

Rodgers, named LMA Manager of the Year after taking Liverpool to within two points of the crown last season, has been given improved terms to reflect his outstanding work.

But the crux of the talks with Fenway Sports Group were about boosting the squad rather than wages.

Liverpool have identified a number of 
targets, headed by Adam Lallana, who has his heart set on a move to 
Anfield. But talks are taking time because Southampton want £30m for the
 forward.

Bayern Munich’s Xherdan Shaqiri is an 
alternative to Lallana, while Liverpool are working on signing Emre Can,
 a £12m-rated Bayer Leverkusen midfielder.

Rodgers says FSG’s support is crucial.

‘I came here because I felt this is one of the biggest clubs in the world,’ he said. ‘I want to be here as long as I can, hopefully playing a part in restoring the club to greatness.

‘I want to win and I need to know that if I am going to be here I’m going to have the best possibility to win.

‘I need to know I can have players that can carry out the instructions that we want to work to win trophies. The owners have been great. They’re winners themselves.’
