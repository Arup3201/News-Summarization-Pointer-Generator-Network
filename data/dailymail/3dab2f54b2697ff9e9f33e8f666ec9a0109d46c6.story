At least five people have died in an overnight attack on Kenya's coast just days after twin massacres killed 60 nearby.

A group of attackers raided a village near the town of Witu, 25 miles from the tourist island of Lamu.

'I am aware that a gang that is unknown attacked Taa village in Witu division yesterday night and killed five people,' Lamu County commissioner, Stephen Ikua, said on Tuesday.

'There is another attack where five people were killed,' a police officer in Lamu said on condition on anonymity.

Somali militant group Al Shabaab, linked to Al Qaeda, claimed responsibility for last week's attacks on the Mpeketoni area - although Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta said local politicians were behind it.

In a statement, President Kenyatta branded the massacres 'well-planned, orchestrated and politically motivated ethnic violence' carried out by 'local political networks'.

The accusations have stoked already tense political rivalry between Kenyatta and opposition parties.

Somalia's Shabaab have carried out a string of revenge attacks for Kenya's military role in southern Somalia, including last year's siege of the Westgate shopping mall that left 67 people dead.

Kenyan fighter jets and attack helicopters launched renewed air strikes on Sunday in southern Somalia targeting Shebab bases.

The raid formed part of an offensive by the UN-backed African Union (AU) mission in Somalia, which launched in March in a bid to reclaim remaining towns from the Islamists.

Kenya army spokesman Major Emmanuel Chirchir boasted the strikes had 'left more than 80 Al-Shebab terrorists killed.'

But Shebab spokesman Abdulaziz Abu Musab, who said Kenyan troops with the AU were also fighting the Islamists on the ground Monday, dismissed claims over 80 of his fighters had been killed as propaganda.

In separate attacks, at least 20 people were killed over the weekend in northeastern Kenya in ethnic clashes.

It is the latest in a series of revenge attacks between rival Somali clans that has killed over 80 people and forced over 75,000 people from their homes since May.
