Furious railway staff called in police after discovering an airline's marketing team at one of their busiest stations - trying to lure their customers away.

Managers at First Great Western were angered when they spotted Flybe workers at Exeter St David's train hub in Devon handing out coffees and promoting flights.

The low-cost airline has just launched daily services from London to Exeter in direct competition to First Great Western rail services.

Staff for the low-cost carrier turned up at 7am at the Devon station to promote the airline's new route (file)

Flybe claim their Exeter to London City route is cheaper and quicker than the train, but First Great Western said they don't include the time to get to the airport and check-in and said rail is a 'strong alternative' on the service

As part of the promotional drive for the £60 return flights, they dispatched staff to stand outside the Exeter station to advertise the deal to commuters.

Angry railway workers complained they did not have permission to stage the guerilla marketing drive and were causing an obstruction.

British Transport Police confirmed they were called at 7am on October 23 after a complaint was made by station staff.

The incident was eventually defused without any arrests although both sides have refused to back down following the spat which was dubbed 'transport wars' by travellers.

First Great Western operates the only major rail route from Devon and Cornwall to London with tickets costing £93.50 for a return from Exeter to London.

Flybe said it was 'regrettable' that First Great Western felt in necessary to contact the police as it was a 'free market' but railway managers said the airline's marketing team had 'inadvertently strayed onto our property'

The new Flybe flights from Exeter to London City Airport are cheaper and quicker - taking 1hr 20 mins compared to 2hr 25 mins on the train.

The company boasts of prices as low as £34.99 for a one-way ticket.

Andrew McConnell, Flybe's director of communications, said: 'It is regrettable that in a commercial free market, First Great Western felt it necessary to contact the police to try to protect themselves from Flybe's offer of free coffee in a public space.

'Nothing's going to stop Flybe from being faster, cheaper and more punctual than rail travel.'

First Great Western responded: 'We welcome healthy competition but Flybe's promotional team inadvertently strayed onto our property last week.

'Direct flights between Exeter and London are good news for the South West, providing those travelling with greater choices.

'However, with the time taken to check-in at Exeter International Airport and the distance the airport is to Exeter city centre, rail remains a strong, viable alternative - and the quickest way to travel.'

British Transport Police said: 'We had received a complaint from station staff regarding representatives of Flybe operating at the station without permission, and a vehicle outside causing an obstruction.

'We spoke to both parties, and the staff representing Flybe agreed to leave the station.'
