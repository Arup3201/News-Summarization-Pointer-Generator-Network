Less than 24 hours after her embarrassing performance in a U.S. Senate debate, Democratic challenger Alison Lundergan Grimes will have to finish her race against Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell without advertising dollars from her party's most aggressive campaign war chest.

The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has not placed any orders for commercial time there between now and Election Day, sending a message that the party is leaving Grimes, the Kentucky secretary of state, to fend for herself.

No DSCC ads are running today in the Bluegrass State. 

Grimes brought national eye-rolls last week when she refused to say in a newspaper editorial board meeting whether she had voted for President Barack Obama, and doubled down on that position in the debate – citing the 'sanctity of the ballot box.'

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is beaming after his opponent's biggest outside contributor has turned off its advertising-money spigot

Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes said Monday – for the second time in a week – that she won't disclose who she voted for in the last two presidential elections

White House spokesman Josh Earnest could barely contain his laughter on Tuesday as reporters quizzed him about Grimes and her reluctance to support Obama. 'I'll tell you that I voted for the president.' he offered

'I'm not going to compromise a constitutional right provided here in Kentucky in order to curry favor on one or [an]other side,' she insisted. 

Reviews were not kind, and the DSCC has thrown in the towel. 

'The DSCC has now spent more than $2 million in Kentucky and continues to make targeted investments in the ground game while monitoring the race for future investments, but is currently not on the air in the state,' a DSCC official said in a statement.

Grimes' campaign has continued to air its own ads, according to the Associated Press, including one that claims McConnell supports amnesty for 3 million immigrants living in the country illegally – an accusation whose weight usually falls on Democrats.

Until Monday night's debate, the DSCC had maintained a constant presence on TV and radio, bashing McConnell 

But the five-term senator has managed to eke out a consistent lead in opinion surveys, averaging a 3 point lead in the latest Real Clear Politics average of polls. 

The Democratic Party is trying to cling to enough seats to retain its control of the U.S. Senate. Republicans need to flip just six to emerge in charge of both houses of Congress. 

The DSCC is moving its Kentucky ad dollars to Georgia, where GOP nominee David Perdue is in a tight race with Democrat Michelle Nunn, the daughter of long-time liberal pol Sam Nunn. Attack ads in that race are focusing on an old court deposition in which Perdue conceded putting time and energy behind a business strategy to 'outsource' jobs overseas. 

Its GOP counterpart, the NRSC, has just announced a $7.4 million increase in ad buys in South Dakota, Alaska, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa and New Hampshire.

On Tuesday at the White House, press secretary Josh Earnest could barely stifle a laugh when a journalist asked him about Grimes' unwillingness to stand behind her party's president.

'A Clinton Democrat': Grimes was a Hillary Clinton delegate to the 2008 Democratic National Convention, but came back to the event four years later pledged to support Obama's renomination

Trouble ahead: Grimes is 3 points down in the polls and McConnell's war chest shows all signs of being solid in the remaining few weeks before Election Day

'Well, I don't know,' Earnest told reporters. 'I've seen some of the news reports about her campaign, but I don't know.'

'I'll tell you that I voted for the president.' he offered. 

Minutes later another reporter needled Earnest with a question about whether he believes he'violated the sanctity of the ballot box by telling us who you voted for.'

Grimes, a polished statewide office-holder, had been seen as the most credible challenge to McConnell since he was first elected to the Senate during the Reagan administration.

Democrats first floated the idea of running actress Ashley Judd, but that idea fizzled after Bill and Hillary Clinton announced that they were backing Grimes instead. 

Grimes has said repeatedly that she is a 'Clinton Democrat'  but refused several times in recent days to say whether she voted for President Obama in the last two general elections.

She was a Democratic National Convention delegate for Hillary in 2008 but was pledged to Obama in 2012.

As a foundering strategy against the ISIS terror army and a Keystone-Kops approach to the Ebola crisis have shortened Obama's coattails, few midterm election candidates from his own party have been willing to welcome him on the campaign stump.

McConnell seized on that discontent, turning his contest with Grimes into a referendum on the president – whose pallid popularity levels are lower than McConnell's.
