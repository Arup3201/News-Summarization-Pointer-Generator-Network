Jailed: Matthew Woods, 19, from Chorley, Lancashire, made a number of derogatory posts about April and missing Madeline McCann

A teenager has been jailed for 12 weeks after admitting making grossly offensive comments on his Facebook page about missing youngster April Jones.

Matthew Woods, 19, from Chorley, Lancashire, made a number of derogatory posts about April and missing Madeline McCann after getting the idea from a website that 'trades in sick jokes'.

Today he was sent to prison for three months amid a chorus of cheers and clapping across the courtroom.

The public gallery erupted while Woods choked back tears as JP Dr Bill 
Hudson told him: 'This was a disgusting and despicable crime which the 
bench find completely abhorrent.

'There
 were words used and references made to the case in Wales and Madeline 
McCann who went missing in Portugal some years ago were nothing less 
than shocking.

'So much so no right thinking person in society should have communicated to them such distress.

'The
 families of those children should not be subjected to any use of social
 media like this. We should all be aware of the sensitivity of other 
people and especially the family involved in such statements made on 
Twitter, Facebook and such like.

'We felt there was no other sentence which would convey the abhorrence that many people have for this sort of crime.'

April, five, disappeared a week ago today from near her home in Machynlleth, Wales. Mark Bridger, 46, is charged with her abduction and murder.

Among Woods' comments were: 'I woke up this morning in the back of a transit van with two beautiful little girls, I found April in a hopeless place.'

Another read: 'Who in their right mind would abduct a ginger kid?'

Others stated 'I love April Jones' and 'Could have just started the greatest Facebook argument ever. April Fools, Who Wants Maddie?'

He also wrote comments of a sexually explicit nature about the five-year-old.

Woods also made offensive references to Madeleine McCann who went missing aged four in Portugal in 2007.

Chorley Magistrates’ Court heard members of the public were so upset about his postings that they reported them to the police.

A 'vigilante mob' of around 50 people later descended upon his home address and the defendant was arrested on Saturday night at a separate address for his own safety.

Woods realised the strength of 
animosity over his postings after his own mother posted a Facebook 
message saying: 'You should stop and think things out before opening ya 
gob.'

He then left a message saying: 'Sorry to my friends and family that have been brought into all this.

'I’m
 not a bad guy just took a joke to far I’ve apologised for what has been
 said and there’s nothing more what I can do sop all this s*** really 
aint going to sort anything nothing more to say on the matter apart from
 sorry again.'

Martina Jay, prosecuting, said: 'When interviewed by police he fully admitted he posted messages about the two missing children.

'He
 said he did it in a bid to make people think his account had been 
hacked. He said it got out of hand and he was drunk while doing it.'

He conceded to police that his Facebook account - available to a large number of people - had not been hacked and that he was responsible for all the postings made on October 3 and 4.

Unemployed Woods entered a guilty plea to sending by means of a public electronic communications network a message or other matter that is grossly offensive.

After meeting his client for the first time, defending solicitor David Edwards told the bench: 'What struck me immediately is that the enormity of what he has done has finally sunk in.

'He did seem genuinely remorseful and regretful for what he had done. At the time he posted these comments not once did he think he would find himself where he is today.'

He said Woods got the idea for the posting from Sickipedia 'which basically trades in sick jokes'.

Mr Edwards added: 'He started receiving derogatory replies almost immediately and then came threats.

'The reality is that before long a number of people realised what he had done and sought him out.'

The solicitor said Woods explained what had started as a joke had gone wrong.

'He
 realises this will have a profound effect on him,' he continued. 'With 
the publicity that has followed he will be known as the man who made 
these comments on Facebook.

He
 has to live with this because of his stupidity. His future is 
uncertain. He does not know whether he can go back to his home address.

'He
 fully accepts he was the author of his own misfortune. Nothing like 
this is going to happen again. He appreciates what he has done and puts 
himself at the mercy of the court.'

He asked for a community service order to be considered but the bench was told that custody could be imposed for anyone who is convicted of using extreme language that causes substantial distress or fear to another.

The bench asked for a pre-sentence report from a probation officer and said it would keep all options open ahead of sentencing, which is set to take place from 2pm today.

The jail term was imposed just 
hours after the same magistrates fined a man £100 and ordered him to pay
 £100 compensation after he racially insulting a black woman.

The
 woman had been driving her car in Chorley when she heard the defendant 
directly shout at her: 'you black f****** c****'. When she stopped and 
confronted him he screwed up a piece of paper and threw it at her face.
