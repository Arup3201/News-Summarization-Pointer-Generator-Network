Scientist Albert Einstein - a third of primary school children believe that he is a reality TV star

A third of primary school children believe Albert Einstein is a reality TV star, a study has found.

Some 29 per cent think they have recently seen the scientist, who died in 1955, on shows such as The X Factor and Britain's Got Talent.

Many were unable to identify great scientists or their achievements;  more than a third of pupils aged 11  to 14 did not know Isaac Newton discovered gravity, despite it featuring on the school curriculum.

Meanwhile, 6 per cent thought  X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos created penicillin while a million children believe chart-topping rapper Professor Green is a real academic.

Furthermore, a confused 35 per cent of five year olds think London Mayor Boris Johnson discovered gravity with one in five primary school children believing that England and Manchester United forward Wayne Rooney is a scientist.

Stephen Hawkins is a hairdresser according to 22 per cent of eight year olds.

However, 68 per cent were able to identify Facebook creator Mark  Zuckerberg, the poll by home appliances firm Haier found.

Electric lightbulb inventor Thomas Edison was credited with creating Facebook by 22 per cent of seven year olds.

And despite spending an average of 17 hours and 34 minutes in front a TV each week, 45 per cent do not know it was invented by John Logie Baird.

Jeff Moody, from Haier, said: 'It is eye-opening to discover children of today are more aware of Mark Zuckerberg than men and women who made iconic discoveries and inventions that revolutionised the modern world.'
