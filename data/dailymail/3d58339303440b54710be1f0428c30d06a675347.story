White is the most popular colour for underwear, but new research says 51 per cent of it goes grey.

Here, we put the most common whitening solutions to the test to see if any of them really work.

We washed a pile of new, white, cotton pants three times in different coloured washes to get them all the same shade of grey.

We kept a pristine, white pair and one of the grey pairs for reference to gauge any colour changes in the rest of the underwear as they were tested.

Daniel Browne, of Blossom & Browne’s Sycamore Launderers And Dry Cleaners in London — a holder of three royal warrants — gives professional advice on each technique.

DENTURE CLEANING TABLETS 

Many people claim an overnight soak in warm water with dissolved denture tablets will transform off-whites

Many people claim an overnight soak in warm water with dissolved denture tablets will transform off-whites.

Denture tablets are a blend of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda), well-known for its cleansing properties, and citric acid, which has natural bleaching properties, so it sounds plausible.

I use two Steradent Active Plus tablets (£1 for 30). The next day, rinsed and dried, the fabric smells minty fresh and the grey has lifted a shade. But the fabric is rough and bobbly.

Expert opinion: Sodium bicarbonate is used as a stain remover and deodoriser, rather than a bleaching agent. It might remove biological stains, such as sweat and smells, but it’s unlikely to bleach out the grey efficiently. 1/10

SUNLIGHT 

It’s the oldest trick in the book: hang laundry in the garden on a bright day and the sun’s powerful ultraviolet rays will bleach any discoloration.

After a day soaking up sunshine, my laundry smells fresh. But the UV rays had whitened my smalls only subtly.

Expert opinion: Sunlight can help fade a ketchup stain on a tablecloth, but it’s unlikely to bleach an entire item of clothing. Further UV exposure may help fade the grey even more, but too much will damage delicate fabric. 2/10

NAPPY DETERGENT 

Napisan powder can make underwear come out a couple of shades lighter

If it can make nappies look good, perhaps it can perk up off-white briefs.

I add a tablespoon of Napisan powder (£3.80 for 800g) to a couple of litres of hot water, give it a stir and leave to soak for two hours. The water and underwear immediately turn bright blue, but there’s a lovely washing powder smell.

After rinsing and drying, I’m amazed. The underwear is a couple of shades lighter and the fabric and elastic look as good as new.

Expert opinion: Soaking agents remove stains, but the combination of bleaching agents and optical brighteners in this product have helped remove and disguise some of the grey, too. 5/10

SOLUBLE ASPIRIN 

This is widely touted online as a fix for off-colour whites. I dissolve three aspirin (30p for 16 tablets) in a litre of warm water and leave my smalls to soak for eight hours.

Once washed, rinsed and dried, the underwear looks tired, as if it has been laundered ten times rather than four, but the fabric is a shade whiter than the Napisan-treated version.

Expert opinion: Salicylic acid in aspirin may have a bleaching effect. I’d be wary of soaking clothes in aspirin solution as its acidity could damage delicates. 6/10

LEMON JUICE 

Lemon is well known for its natural bleaching effects.

I add the juice of three lemons to a litre of hot water and leave my pants to soak overnight. In the morning, the water and underwear are yellow.

After a rinse and tumble dry, the knickers are back to their original grey and the decorative elastic at the waist is curled and puckered.

Expert opinion: Lemon juice is unlikely to whiten clothes because it contains fruit sugars, which attract dirt and cause discoloration and staining. The acid from the juice may have started to eat away at the elastic in the decorative waistband, too. 0/10

HOUSEHOLD BLEACH 

the most obvious method to try is household bleach. I soak greying whites in warm water with a little bleach (£2 for two litres) for an hour.

After washing, rinsing and drying the underwear, it’s obvious the bleach has removed more grey than all the other techniques.

However, the underwear is still a dull off-white, with a lingering smell of chlorine. The fabric looks rather tired and the elastic has slackened, too.

Expert opinion: Bleach can whiten greying fabrics efficiently, but getting the ratio of bleach and water and the timing of your soak right can be almost impossible.

Nine times out of ten, the fabric will turn yellow. Always check the care labels on garments to make sure it’s safe to use bleach as it can damage some fabrics. 7/10

DR BECKMANN GLOWHITE 

I had high hopes for this product, which claims it will ‘restore that intensive whiteness’ even at low temperatures.

Empty a sachet  into the washing machine with my usual detergent, then run a 30c wash. Washed and dried, the grey has faded a couple of shades

I empty a sachet (£1.85 for five) into the washing machine with my usual detergent, then run a 30c wash. Washed and dried, the grey has faded a couple of shades — on a par with the aspirin effect.

The fabric feels soft, but the elastic is curled and mis-shapen.

Expert opinion: Most supermarket whitening treatments will improve the brightness of your whites. But a coloured trim or logo may transfer or fade. 6/10

SLOW COOKER 

A friend put me on to this bizarre whitening technique. Borax substitute (£1.59 for 500g) is a traditional cleaning powder that can be used for everything from scouring work surfaces to making your own laundry detergent.

I place my underwear in a slow cooker with 2tbsp of powder and a couple of litres of water and put it on a low setting overnight.

The next day, the kitchen is filled with a metallic, chemical smell. Washed and dried, the knickers are a few shades lighter, but with an odd salmon pink hue.

Expert opinion: Putting cotton underwear on a very hot wash may help to brighten it, but an eight-hour boil wash is extreme and likely to damage the fabric and delicate trimmings. 4/10

HOW PROFESSIONALS DO IT 

Daniel Browne says: ‘The main reason underwear goes grey is transference of colour from other garments, so always wash whites separately.

‘White cotton should brighten up on a very hot wash. This is not true for all fabrics, so always check the care instructions.

‘Optical brightener (the little blue dots in your washing powder) helps make white clothes appear whiter, but can build up over time, leaving it dull and grey.

‘The colour in fabric softener will also dull whites over time. Gentle hand wash detergent and a white fabric softener can control this.

‘Keep your washing machine really clean. Mould, fluff and dirt inside the drum and drawers can discolour clothing.

‘Three or four times a year, clean your machine by adding a litre of white vinegar to your empty machine once it has filled with warm water and allowing it to run through a hot cycle.’
