Tory chairman Grant Shapps ruled out making a deal with Ukip after the election

David Cameron will not go into a coalition with Ukip if his party fails to win a majority at the General Election, it was claimed today.

Grant Shapps, the Tory party chairman, publicly ruled out a pact with Nigel Farage’s party, saying ‘we are not going to do pacts and deals with Ukip.’

He conceded it would be ‘an incredibly close election’, with the polls showing the Conservative and Labour neck and neck and a high probability of another hung Parliament.

The Tories have not ruled out another coalition with the Liberal Democrats if they emerge the largest party, but fall short of the 326 seats required for an overall majority.

But recent analysis suggests that even with the support of the Lib Dems, who are set to lose around half their seats in May, they may still fail to win enough seats to form a government.

Ukip, who currently have two MPs, could win as many as five or six seats in May, including one for Mr Farage who is standing in the Tory-held seat of Thanet South in Kent.

Mr Shapps this morning gave a speech highlighting the ‘chaos’ which would come with a future Labour government, especially if it went into Coalition with the Scottish Nationalists, who are expected to take at least a dozen Labour seats in Scotland.

Asked if he would rule out a Coalition between the Conservatives and Ukip, he said: ‘I can rule [it] out, we are not going to do pacts and deal with Ukip, we are looking for an overall majority’

He said the only poll which mattered was on election day, in 97 days’ time, and said there would be many voters still undecided as the public tend to think about an election ‘until the last ten days’.

‘We have seen the polls close and I’m the first to concede this is going to be an incredibly close election’ he said. ‘With the Conservatives you know what you’re getting.

‘You’re getting a competent government who is serious about running the economy, serious about reducing the deficit and eventually producing a surplus. With any of the other choices, you are going to get a large degree of chaos.’

Ukip MEP today dismissed Mr Shapps' claim that the Tories would not go into Coalition or enter into a 'confidence and supply' deal

Mr Farage said last year that he could form a tactical alliance with the Tories or Labour if his party wins a string of seats in May. Under a so-called ‘confidence and supply’ deal, his MPs could agree to support key measures such as the Budget, but the party would not enter into a formal Coalition or hold ministerial posts.

Mr Cameron has promised £7.2billion of tax cuts if he wins a second term – by raising the level at which people start to pay income tax from £10,500 to £12,500 and increasing the salary level at which people start to pay the higher 40p rate of tax from £41,865 to £50,000 by the end of the Parliament.

The Prime Minister had suggested he would start to cut taxes in his first year, although the deficit will not be eliminated until 2018 at least. But Mr Shapps would not be drawn on this yesterday, saying:

‘The commitment is by the end of the next Parliament and the timing will of course be dependent on the economic performance of the British economy.’

But he added: ‘It’s absolutely do-able and I think we’ve got the economic credibility to show we can both reduce taxes and reduce the deficit in this Parliament and in the next one.’
