A husband allegedly bragging about cheating on his wife has been publicly shamed on Facebook, after a train passenger overheard his conversation.

The picture of the man, who had been traveling on a train from Philadelphia with friends, has since been shared more than 183,000 times since a Pennsylvania mother posted in on Wednesday.

'If this is your husband, I have endured
 a 2 hour train ride from Philadelphia listening to this loser and his 
friends brag about their multiple affairs and how their wives are too 
stupid to catch on. Oh please repost...' Steph Strayer wrote on 
Wednesday.

Bragger: This picture of a man on a Philadelphia train boasting of affairs was posted on Facebook

While it is not known if the husband has been identified, the post has opened up the debate about whether it is right to publicly shame a stranger on social media.

Anna North writes on Salon: 'It's now possible to use social media to enforce 
behavior in public and semi-public spaces in a way it never was before."'

Fed up: Steph Strayer was so annoyed at the man's boasts that she put his picture online

She adds that while the post attracted a
 lot of attention, it is important for people to remember that the man 
may not be married or be having an affair.

He could easily have just been showing off to his friends.

Earlier this year, a web company fired one of its employees after she took to Twitter to complain about the sexist comments being made by two men sitting near her at a conference.

Not only did Adria Richards lose her job, she was also the subject of a vicious online bullying campaign.

In a statement, her company SendGrid Inc, said that although it supports the need to report inoffensive behavior, publicly shaming the offenders 'was not the appropriate way to handle the situation'.

According to The Washington Post, a San Jose Mercury News columnist argued: 'The chain of events illustrates the worst features of the Internet â€”- the instant rush to judgment, the ugly personal attacks, the urge to punish a perceived wrongdoer.'

Blog sites however, such as Subwaycouture.com provide an outlet to commuters fed up with the inconsiderate actions of fellow passengers.

From sloppy eaters and drunks, to shoppers who feel their bags are more deserving of a seat than another person, the site has become a popular place to shame bad behavior.

It remains to be seen however, if the passenger sharing Ms Strayer's train carriage will have to face any consequences from his boasts.
