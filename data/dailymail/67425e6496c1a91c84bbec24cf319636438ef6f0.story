A cruise ship has returned to a Houston port a day early after more than 170 people on board fell sick - just days after staff on another vessel reported 700 illnesses.

At least 162 passengers and 11 crew aboard the Caribbean Princess reported symptoms of a highly contagious norovirus before the vessel returned to the Bayport Cruise Terminal late on Thursday.

Despite the illnesses, cruise officials insisted that they cut the week-long trip short because of heavy fog threatening to close the port - which many passengers doubted.

The early return came just a day after another cruise ship, the Royal Caribbean's Explorer of the Seas, 
returned to New Jersey on Wednesday - two days early - after nearly 700 aboard fell sick.

Docked: The Caribbean Princess returned to a Houston Port a day early after 170 people fell ill

The Caribbean Princess left the Pasadena
 port on January 25 and headed to the Caribbean with more than 4,200 people 
aboard. It was supposed to return Saturday.

But it returned to the port late on Thursday night and started letting passengers off on Friday. The cruise company said it would pay for hotels for people with flights booked for the Saturday.

Princess Cruises, owned by Carnival Corps., said the norovirus had spread quickly and that the Centers for Disease Control officials will board the ship on Friday to ensure thorough sanitation.

Norovirus is a contagious illness that can cause nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.

Victim: Passenger Murray Sharkey felt cruise staff weren't honest about why they were returning

CDC spokesman Llelwyn Grant told the Houston Chronicle that once the outbreak was identified, ship employees increased cleaning and disinfection procedures.

Princess Cruises spokeswoman Julie 
Benson said the ship 'will be undergoing a 
thorough sanitization' before its next cruise, which is 
scheduled for around 4 pm on Saturday.

The company had said in a statement on Thursday that the trip was cut short because of fog - but it did acknowledge that dozens of people had been treated for a virus.

'Caribbean Princess has experienced an increase in the number of cases of gastroenteritis among passengers, which has been confirmed to be norovirus,' the statement said.

'Because of the increased sensitivity surrounding norovirus by both cruise lines and the (CDC) in this winter season, we notified the CDC... to ensure all appropriate measures are followed for an extensive sanitation of the ship prior to the next cruise departing February 1.'

But passengers said they feel like the staff where using the fog as an excuse.

'The announcement that was made Tuesday night was if you're sick don't come to the infirmary,' said passenger Murray Sharkey, who spoke to KHOU while he was still on the ship on Thursday night.

'We were waiting in line to get in the dining room tonight and there was a woman down on the floor.

' I just want to get off because it's been misinformation. That's their story and they're sticking to it.'

Another passenger told FOX26 that they weren't allowed to touch anything and that all staff had been wearing gloves.

On Monday, they received a bulletin saying that people were sick, and 'that evening is when they started lying to us' and claimed they were returning to the port for their own safety because of fog.

The outbreak is the third on a U.S.-based cruise ship just this year, according to the CDC's vessel sanitation program. Last year, there were nine reported incidents, with seven caused by norovirus.

Also this week, nearly 700 passengers and crew became ill with a gastrointestinal illness on Royal Caribbean's Explorer of the Seas and returned to New Jersey on Thursday.
