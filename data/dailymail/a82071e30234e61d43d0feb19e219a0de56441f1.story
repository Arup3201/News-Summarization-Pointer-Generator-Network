The ex-girlfriend of Lostprophets singer Ian Watkins claims the paedophile rock musician had fantasies about kidnapping and murdering a baby.

Joanne Mjadzelics, 38, claims Watkins' sick behaviour would have eventually degenerated into even more extreme crimes if he had not been caught.

Watkins was described as a 'determined and committed paedophile' after he admitted attempting to rape a fan's 11-month-old baby son along with 10 other child sex offences on Tuesday.

Horror: Joanne Majic, the ex-girlfriend of Ian Watkins, said he had fantasies about kidnapping and murdering a baby

Miss Mjadzelics had a two year on-off relationship with the rock star from 2006 and as time went on, Watkins revealed his sordid fantasies.

In August 2008, after receiving emails from the singer describing sex with an 11-year-old girl and suggestive photographs of a three-year-old, she went to police.

She told the Sunday People: 'I’m absolutely sure Ian wouldn’t have stopped at abuse.

'He wanted to rape and kill children. He wanted to rape newborns.

'He even wanted to get me pregnant so he could rape our baby.'

The singer, a former boyfriend of BBC presenter Fearne Cotton and model Alexa Chung, also admitted to her he used his Lostprophets fame to turn young girls into ‘Superfans’ willing to allow him to abuse their children.

The former lead singer with multi-million selling band Lostprophets made a series of admissions in a last-minute change of plea ahead of what would have been his trial at Cardiff Crown Court

Miss Mjadzelics also says she warned police about the singer's depraved nature four years ago after he told her he wanted to have sex with a child, but says they refused to investigate it.

She was persuaded to give up as Watkins was alerted about her claims and she was threatened with harassment charges.

But a year later he was bombarding her with more sick fantasies, revealed he was now addicted to heroin and had raped a five-year-old girl.

At that point, she started to gather a file of evidence that eventually led to Watkins' conviction.

Miss Mjadzelics claimed besotted female fans of the paedophile are hiding the true 
extent of his offending because they secretly offered their children for
 abuse.

Her claims come as another of Watkins' former lovers, Lostprophets fan Krysta Boyle, reveals he gushed over her tiny frame.

Ms Boyle, from Orange County in 
California, was 19 years old, 4'11", and wore child-size clothing when 
she met the singer in Hawaii.

She told The Sun on Sunday: 'Looking 
back, it was obvious something was wrong with him from the moment we 
met. But I was a young impressionable fan.

'I remember him commenting a lot on my body and small frame.'

She added that he tried to film their sexual encounters and once choked her during sex.

Today his ex-bandmates insisted they did not know about the abuse.

Speaking for the first time since Watkins' last-minute change of plea on Tuesday ahead of what would have been his trial at Cardiff Crown Court, they released a statement to fans revealing they were 'heartbroken, angry and disgusted'.

They said: 'Many of you understandably want to know if we knew what Ian was doing. To be clear: We did not.

'We knew that Ian was a difficult 
character. Our personal relationships with him had deteriorated in 
recent years to a point that working together was a constant, miserable 
challenge.

'But despite his battles with drugs, his egotistic behaviour and the 
resulting fractures and frustrations within our band, we never imagined 
him capable of behaviour of the type he has now admitted.'

The Independent Police Complaints 
Commission (IPCC) is investigating claims that South Wales Police failed
 to act quickly enough having allegedly been told Watkins was planning 
to abuse children as early as 2008. 

They
 have now launched a second investigation over the handling of a 
complaint made against Watkins to South Yorkshire Police in 2012. 

Watkins
 was arrested late last year after South Wales Police raided his home on
 a drugs tip and stumbled upon hard drives containing images, videos and
 conversations about him attacking children.

From
 early 2010 horrified fans who had become friends with Watkins went 
online to beg for help after discovering vile images on his computer.

In one post, written before his arrest, a fan wrote: ‘His on-off girlfriend reported him to police twice for being a paedophile.

‘He
 sent pornographic pictures of a little girl to a few girls telling them
 it was a five-year-old girl he’d raped. He also watches child porn 
constantly. Sick sick man.’

Watkins allegedly boasted to obsessed female fans that he had HIV and was on a mission to pass it on to children.

Watkins, 38, is due to be sentenced next month after 
he admitted to a string of horrific child sex offences including 
attempting to rape a fan's 11-month-old baby boy

The comments will only add to the growing
 fear that Watkins's guilty pleas offer only a glimpse of the true 
extent of his drug-fuelled debauchery.

The 36-year-old, from Pontypridd, South 
Wales, plotted the shocking abuse with the two mothers of the babies in a
 series of text and internet messages.

The baby's mother, Woman A, admits aiding and abetting the attempted rapes on her son.

She also admits sexually touching the child and taking photographs, before sending them to Watkins.

Watkins also admitted conspiring to rape and sexually touch the daughter of the second fan.

He admits aiding and abetting Woman B to touch her daughter while he watched on Skype.

An
 earlier court hearing was told police had 72 pages of conversations 
between the pair online talking about their sexual relationship.

Woman B mentioned she had a daughter of a young age and Watkins said: 'Bring her along as well.'

She said she was getting the child ready for their meeting together - and 'what they all will do together' when they meet up.

She
 admits sexual assault after touching the child, she also admits taking 
an indecent photograph of the child before distributing them.

Anyone who has been affected by the Watkins case, or other cases of child abuse, is urged to contact South Wales Police on 029 20634184 or the NSPCC on 0808 800 5000.
