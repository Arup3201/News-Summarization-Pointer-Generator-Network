Anyone looking for a guaranteed high-quality hotel stay knows one universal truth: depending on where you are in the world, accommodations can be seriously hit or miss.

But, as it turns out, it really does depend on exactly where you're holidaying.

For the most highly-rated hotels in one spot, head to Sanya in China, which tops this year's ranking of the most reputable hotels in the world.

Sanya in China is ranked first when it comes to the reputation of the city's hotels, according to Trivago.co.uk

The city on Hainan Island has become a popular tourist destination in recent years, due to its tropical climate

The 2015 Reputation Ranking, released by hotel comparison website Trivago.co.uk, has compiled the top 100 cities, ranking the global destinations according to the reputation of their hotels.

Each destination's score is based on over 140 million hotel reviews and aggregated ratings. 

With all that considered, it was the Chinese city that received top honours as having the most liked hotels in the world.

Sanya boasts many high-rise resort hotels and offers very good value for money per night

1. Sanya (China) - Index: 86.95% - Average hotel price per night: £86 

2. Hanoi (Vietnam) - Index: 84.76% - Average hotel price per night:  £39

3. Sorrento (Italy) - Index: 84.70% - Average hotel price per night: £122

4. Fès (Morocco) - Index: 84.64% - Average hotel price per night: £74

5. Suzhou (China) - Index - 84.54% - Average hotel price per night: £52

6. Cusco (Peru) - Index: 84.43% - Average hotel price per night: £62

7. Sedona (ΑΖ, USA) - Index: 84.39% - Average hotel price per night: £111

In Hanoi, which came in second, also has a low cost per night on its hotels. Pictured: the Metropol Hotel

The city on Hainan Island has become a popular tourist destination in recent years, due to its tropical climate. 

The destination contains a large number of high-rise resort hotels, often praised for their value, excellent facilities, friendly service and beautiful location.

The value for money consideration seems to be a common factor among the top 10 destinations, with eight boasting an average price per night of less than £100.

The Vietnamese city averages a hotel price of £39 per night, while offering stunning views of the river

Hanoi, which comes in second, for example, has an average hotel price per night of just £39. 

Clearly, good value hotels dictate popularity - and if guests feel like they got some bang for their buck, they're more likely to rate a property favourably. 

But when it comes to the UK, London is nowhere to be found in the top 100.

Instead, it was York who was named the best in Britain, coming in at position 35.

Edinburgh and Liverpool followed close behind, in positions 45 and 48, respectively.

York, UK tops the list for best British value - for properties such as the Grays Court Hotel, pictured here

London, however, failed to make the list entirely, though it's usually found at the bottom of the list

35. York

45. Edinburgh

48. Liverpool

87. Manchester

96. Birmingham 

York hotels were praised for their character, comfortable rooms and excellent service, while guests in Edinburgh most enjoyed the location and spacious rooms.

Liverpool was praised for its atmosphere and stylish hotel interiors.

Manchester and Birmingham came in in the bottom 20. Hotels in both destinations were criticised for their bad value and poor quality rooms. 

Usually placed towards the bottom of the list and criticised for its small, expensive hotel rooms, London received an index of 75.76 per cent and failed to make the list entirely.
