She's best friends with Kendall Jenner and has an edgy sense of style so it comes as no surprise that Hailey Baldwin has been snapped up for a major gig with fashion brand French Connection.

The 17-year-old model and IT girl has been unveiled as the new face of the high street brand and stars in an edgy new photoshoot to showcase the label's Work to Weekend range, which will land in stores throughout September.

Hailey, who is the daughter of the youngest Baldwin brother, Stephen, known for his starring roles in an array of Hollywood blockbuster hits, proves her credentials as a model in the smouldering shoot. 

Look who it is! Kendall Jenner's best friend Hailey Baldwin, 17, has been unveiled as the new face of French Connection and stars in an edgy new photoshoot to showcase the label's Work to Weekend range

Jewel tones are key for AW14, and play a prominent role in the range, with hues of emerald and sapphire aiming to offer a sense of richness and luxury to fitted dresses and skirts slashed at the knee.

Cosy knits are paired with dressy skirts and there's enough cosy knits to see you through winter.

From the must-have polo neck to the relaxed sweater, the range is perfect for off-duty dressing.

The classic belted winter coat, a key piece in the collection, is given a modern update with the season’s hot colour, vibrant pink. 

As the daughter of actor Stephen Baldwin, Hailey can count several public figures as her friends, including 18-year-old model Kendall Jenner.

The pair have been friends for years, having both grown up in Los Angeles.

Earlier this year, the gal pals were spotted bonding catching up while paddle boarding in the Hamptons, and Hailey even joined the Kardashian family for a moment of filming.

On the professional front, Hailey was recently featured in a photo shoot for Love Magazine, and opened up to the publication about her famous family.

She said: 'The thing that was annoying about having an uncle that’s in 30 Rock is that kids [her age] didn’t understand it. They’re like, "What?" Then they’re like, "You have to go away to LA with your dad, what?" And they didn’t get that. And that’s what I’ve struggled with my whole life in school, too.' 

Young star: Hailey follows in the footsteps of Suki Waterhouse, who once worked with the brand, and is already making waves in Hollywood thanks to her tight network of famous friends
