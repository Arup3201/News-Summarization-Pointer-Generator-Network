On the run: 'Pocahontas' was being sought by police after a man was ambushed and shot dead in Houston, Texas

A stripper known as Pocahontas was on the run after being charged with murder for setting up a robbery in which a man was shot and killed by her two accomplices.

Luerissie Ashley Ross, 20, arranged to meet  Budrohoe Briscoe on February 17 in Houston, Texas after texting him photographs of herself.

Mr Briscoe had gone with a friend to pick up the stripper who he described as a 'friend' at an apartment complex.

The 20-year-old woman took a phone call 
while with the two men in which she was heard to say: 'Yes, there are 
two of them', according to ABC13.

The
men then drove Pocahontas to her apartment because she needed to 
collect her cell phone charger.

Briscoe was lured out of his vehicle by the stripper where two men were lying in wait.

They robbed and shot Briscoe. He died in hospital from his injuries on February 29.

According
to local police, Ross had been working at a gentleman's club called Ice Cream Castles.

She was said to have been involved in a similar attack at the apartment complex a month earlier.Â 

Police later recovered digital images of the exotic dancer from Briscoe's phone.

According to court documents, police met with Ross on March 20 and she admitted to organising the attack on Briscoe.

She was later released and police have now launched a manhunt for the 20-year-old dancer.
