West Ham held on to beat Premier League champions Manchester City in a thrilling contest at Upton Park on Saturday afternoon.

The Hammers are unlikely occupiers of a top-four place in the Premier League, and further strengthened their position with a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Manuel Pellegrini's side.

Morgan Amalfitano and Diafra Sakho put the home side two goals to the good before David Silva set up a frantic finale with a superb finish into the corner. 

Here, Sportsmail's Sam Cunningham gives his verdict on how the players performed. 

West Ham (4-1-2-1-2): 

Adrian - 7

What a save to deny Sergio Aguero in the second half after the striker had wriggled free and another in the opening period when the ball ricocheted off the City man and he reacted quickly.

Carl Jenkinson - 6.5

Got forward regularly down the right flank and was composed at the back. An all-round solid performance.

James Collins - 7

Sensational block to keep out Aguero's follow-up effort in the second half. A potentially very difficult afternoon well dealt with.

Winston Reid - 6.5

Solid at the back, but not always on top of Aguero and Silva, who broke through in patches, particularly in the second half.

Aaron Cresswell - 7.5

Another consummate display from the full-back, who is taking to life at West Ham well. Great cross to set up the second.

Alex Song impressed for West Ham, and was their star man against Manchester City

Alex Song - 8

Yet another commanding display from the centre of the park. His through ball to play in Enner Valencia to set up West Ham's first could not have been better weighted. Immense.

Mark Noble - 7

Tireless running and tackling all game. He just does not stop haring around the pitch. A real asset to his team.

Morgan Amalfitano - 7

Left with a tap-in for West Ham's opener and made life difficult for City's defence with his runs from midfield.

Stewart Downing - 5.5

Sent a free header over the bar in the first half which would've put them two goals ahead.

Enner Valencia - 7

His run to set up the first was immense – such a burst of pace it took him flying into the home fans.

Diafra Sakho - 7.5

Strong and powerful up front, he ran Manchester City's back line ragged all afternoon – winning headers and holding up the ball. A constant threat. 

Manager: Sam Allardyce - 8.5 

Diafra Sakho scored to double West Ham's lead with 15 minutes to go in the match

Manchester City (4-4-2):

Joe Hart - 7

Had a busier afternoon than he was possibly expecting. The save from Valencia at point-blank range was brave and crucial – and required treatment when he took a knock afterwards.

Pablo Zabaleta - 5

Tried his best on City's right flank to get forward and support the attack, but it occasionally left them vulnerable on the break.

Vincent Kompany - 4.5

Struggled to deal with the pace and power of Valencia and Sakho, but his afternoon was made more difficult alongside Eliaquim Mangala.

Eliaquim Mangala - 3

Shocking performance from the £32million man. Mis-hit clearances, being tackled by opposition forwards and always looking vulnerable.

Gael Clichy - 5

Not a glistening performance, by any stretch of the imagination, and looked tired on the left.

Jesus Navas - 5Not his best performance in a Manchester City shirt. Usually threatens opposition players with his speed but never got going.

Fernando - 5

Drove City forward at times and had his work cut-out with Yaya Toure putting in another less-than-convincing effort.

Yaya Toure - 5.5

Two glorious chances to score, both in the second half. The first, Adrian somehow kept out with a diving save, the second he curled on to the bar.

David Silva - 7

Combined well with Aguero for City's most dangerous attacks. Sensational solo goal to shimmy past two and bend in an effort.

Sergio Aguero was disappointing and should have been sent off in the first half

Replays of Aguero's tackle shows that he should have been sent off for a two-footed lunge on Mark Noble

Sergio Aguero - 5.5

Bright and looked sharp on the ball, getting away a few long-range efforts, but West Ham did well to nullify his threat. Still should've scored on three occasions.

Edin Dzeko - 5

A very quiet afternoon for the striker, who needs to start scoring to warrant a place in City's starting line-up.

Manager: Manuel Pellegrini - 5
