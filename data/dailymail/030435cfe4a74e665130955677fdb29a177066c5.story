She rose to fame after winning reality TV show 'Signed by Katie Price' but Amy Willerton turned down a contract with the star's management to strike out on her own.

Now she's battling it out to be crowned Miss Universe competing in Russia against models from around the world.

The 21-year-old from Bristol has already impressed on the catwalk in an evening gown and bikini, while she wore a skimpy take on royal robes as she dressed up as a Queen for the 'national costume' round.

Vying for the title: Amy Willerton representing Great Britain at the rehearsals of Miss Universe 2013 in Moscow

The winner, announced in a worldwide TV broadcast on Saturday, will gain a luxury lifestyle for a year funded by Donald Trump. Amy won her place in the competition after winning the title of Miss London in 2012 and then Miss Universe Great Britain in 2013.

Her beauty pageant success came after she controversially turned down a contract with Katie's company, BlackSheep Management.

Two years ago, she beat 10,000 other young models to be crowned the winner of Sky Living's show Signed by Katie Price.

On the worldwide stage: The model, who won the reality TV Signed by Katie Price, takes a break during Miss Universe rehearsals. The winner will be announced in a live broadcast on Saturday

On entering the competition, she was promised a ­modelling contract with mentoring from Katie, her picture on the front cover of OK! magazine, a Range Rover and a holiday in the Maldives.

But she told The Sunday Mirror she never received any of these things and felt 'let down' after giving up a place studying media at Cardiff University to take part in the show.

She said at the time: 'I never expected overnight fame. But I don't believe the promises from Katie or her team were kept.

'I gave up my job, was encouraged to turn down a place at university and had to put my life on hold.'

She said she had always admired Katie 
and identified with her as she has a brother who is disabled like the 
glamour model's son Harvey.

But far from being mentored by her, Amy said Katie had no time for her and she felt she didn't even like her. Amy said the management company failed to find any work for her so she had to survive on her savings and support from her parents.

She added: 'I'm so angry. When I won, I thought life 
would change. It has... but for the worse. My life's been turned upside 
down. I've had enough of Katie and don't want anything more to do with 
her or her team.'

Katie was said to react with fury when Amy refused to sign a contract after winning the show calling her 'arrogant, stuck-up and fake.'

Meanwhile BlackSheep
 Management issued a statement saying they were 'disappointed' in Amy 
saying she 'had changed from the girl we met during filming.'

They
 said it was unreasonable for her to expect overnight success as it 
would take 'time and money' to raise her profile. They said they had not
 failed to deliver the Range Rover (but that Amy couldn't drive it 
because she couldn't afford the £10,000 insurance) and had offered her a
 holiday in the Marbella instead of the Maldives.

Fall out: Amy said she felt let down after Katie Price failed to mentor her as promised when she won her search for a star

Amy's website states that she walked away from Katie and her team because 'she wanted to take her career in a different direction.'

She added in another interview with The Mirror that she hasn't had contact with Katie since.

She said: 'I broke off all contact when I decided to leave. A lot of very upsetting things happened - some of which Kate doesn't even know about - but I think we are both best moving on and going our separate ways.

'There was only room for one leading lady in that circus. I want to be the leading lady of my own game.'

And Katie isn't the only person Amy has broken ties with ahead of her Miss Universe appearance.

The Daily Mail's Richard Kay reported last month how she had been dumped by her multi-millionaire diamond dealer boyfriend, Mohamed Shawesh.

The model said she was upset by the break-up but focussing on the Miss Universe competition was helping her move on.

She said: 'We were madly in love - but then he dumped me on holiday. I was quite shocked at first, but I think that it was a classic case of me not being able to give him enough attention.

'I need to focus on my career because I'm very ambitious and it's much more difficult with a man around.'

While she isn't being mentored by Katie, it seems Amy's career may yet follow a similar path to the glamour model's. She's tipped 
to be taking part in the new series of I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of 
Here, the show that propelled Katie's career.
