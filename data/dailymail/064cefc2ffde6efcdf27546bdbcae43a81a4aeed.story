Paedophiles will be given the same treatment as terrorists under a crackdown on child abuse to be included in the Queen's Speech.

David Cameron said that he wanted to close a loophole that allows sexual predators to create and possess ‘manuals’ giving tips on how to identify victims, groom them and evade capture.

In future, they will face the same kind of sanctions as extremists who download guides to bomb-making.

The Government wants to crack down on paedophiles owning or creating 'manuals' that teach them how to groom children (Picture posed by model)

The issue came to light after GCHQ and the National Crime Agency found online examples of the guides in the chaotic part of cyberspace known as the ‘dark web’ or 'deep web'. This is where tens of trillions of pages that most people have never seen are stored. They include everything from statistics to the illegal sale of human body parts.

The Prime Minister told The Sunday Times: ‘It's completely unacceptable that there is a loophole in the law which allows paedophiles to write and distribute these disgusting documents.

‘I want to ensure we do everything we can to protect children – and that's why I am making them illegal.’

The new law is expected to be in force by the time of next year’s General Election, and could be implemented in an amendment to the Obscene Publications Act 1959, according to the newspaper.

The Terrorism Act 2000 outlawed terrorist training manuals.

The move was announced after it emerged that a paedophile teacher drugged and abused up to 60 boys as young as 10 at a British private school.

William Vahey, who taught history and geography at Southbank International School in London between 2009 and 2013, committed suicide last month as FBI agents closed in.
