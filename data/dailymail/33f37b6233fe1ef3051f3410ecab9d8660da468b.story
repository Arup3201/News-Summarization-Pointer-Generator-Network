Mattel is set to launch a series of Barbie clothing lines this fall, spanning several decades of fashion inspiration and in partnership with three major retailers.

Forever 21's collaboration will channel the Nineties aesthetic with its 29-piece capsule collection, scheduled to hit stores September 5. Wildfox has taken on the Eighties vibe with its eight-piece collection, launching November 15. And Lord & Taylor will launch a 12-piece line of Barbie-themed sleepwear inspired by the Fifties and Sixties era on November 14.

'What we’re trying to focus on is that Barbie is a brand much bigger than an 11-inch fashion doll,' Mattel's senior vice president Jessica Dunne told WWD, adding that it's all part of the brand's mission to re-establish Barbie is a modern day fashion icon.

Never a doll moment: Mattel has partnered up with Forever 21, Wildfox (pictured, its Eighties bikini) and Lord & Taylor to launch three collections, all inspired by items from Barbie's wardrobe throughout the ages

Forever 21's line encompasses sportswear, outerwear, cosmetics and accessories; and boasts acid pinks and bold graphic designs; priced between $3.90 and $24.90.

Wildfox took a peek into Malibu Barbie's colorful resort wardrobe and re-created Eighties items such as a pale blue high-waisted bikini and large circular sunglasses, as well as denim and sportswear items.

The line has been dubbed The Wildfox Dreamhouse, and will retail for between $37.50 and $183 at online boutiques including Nordstrom, Bloomingdales and Saks Fifth Avenue.

'Barbie meant a lot to me growing up, and with this company I am basically playing grown-up Barbie all the time,' said Kimberley Gordon, Wildfox cofounder and creative director.

'I thought it would be fun to imagine if those dolls were real'

Last but not least, Lord & Taylor's sleepwear range is aimed at 'the slightly older customer' and will be based on a Fifties and Sixties aesthetic, priced between $32 and $46.

It's not the first time the plastic peroxide blonde with the impossibly tiny waist has mingled with grown-up fashion.

In celebration of Barbie's 50th birthday in 2009, Barbie-eque models were sent down the New York Fashion Week runway in special creations by haute couturiers including Diane von Fürstenberg, Vera Wang, Calvin Klein, and Christian Louboutin.

It is, however, the brand's biggest break into the mass-consumer fashion market so far, and its latest attempt to stop us from ever quite growing out of Barbie.
