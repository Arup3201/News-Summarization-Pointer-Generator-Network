Tributes poured to Phillip Hughes after the Australian batsman lost his life two days after being struck by a bouncer while batting for South Australia at the SCG.

Hughes, who passed away three days before his 26th birthday, dominated the front pages in his homeland.

Team-mates past and present, opposition players - including Kevin Pietersen - and politicians remembered a cricketer who won respect on and off the field.

The Age reflects on the tragedy, asking its readers to take nothing for granted

The Melbourne paper carries a personal piece from former England batsman Kevin Pietersen, entitled: 'Quiet, humble, fearless... the Phillip Hughes That I Knew'.

Pietersen says that Hughes was a player whose scores he would look out for, saying he batted with a 'wonderful spirit and freedom', before paying tribute to his game-changing batting ability.

'I know a lot of people were talking very positively about how he was developing his cricket. He was moulding his game to Test cricket. He batted beautifully, and responsibly, against us [England] at Trent Bridge last year, making an unbeaten 81 in the first innings,' Pietersen says.

'He was a dangerous player who you wanted to get out early because you knew if he stayed in for a whole session he would score quickly.'

Pietersen added that Sean Abbott, the bowler of the fateful delivery, needs support.

'He needs a lot of strong people around him to encourage him to continue playing our great game and understand this was a freak accident,'.

Sydney's Daily Telegraph shows a poignant picture of Phillip Hughes on a sombre day for cricket

The Telegraph's Ben Horne dissects Hughes' fateful last innings, referring to 'a one in a million shot' which struck the 25-year-old.

'Those who know Hughes’s game well, noticed there was a steely resolve about the diminutive left-hander from the moment he walked out to start the day,' Horne writes. 

'If there’s a signature Hughes shot, it’s his cut — and he pulled out one of the most exquisite examples of the stroke midway through his innings,' he continues. 

His piece ends in reflective fashion. 

'The Cricket Australia live feed makes for eerie reading.

'“No run, problem here, misses a pull shot and hit, urgent treatment needed.”

'That’s how Phillip Hughes’ career ended.

'But it’s not how his talents as a batsman or his courage as a person will be remembered.' 

The Herald Sun dedicates much of its edition to remember the life of the young opening batsman

There is no sense to the loss of such a sublime talent, says Richard Hinds of the Melbourne tabloid.

Calling Hughes 'a wonderful work in progress', the article remembers ' a polite and ever-smiling cricketer'.

'The harrowing scenes that unfolded in public view, the plight of the unfortunate bowler Sean Abbott and the helplessness of those at the SCG scene compound our sense of shock and despair,' Hinds says.

'The game that brought the sublime talent and wonderful character of Phillip Hughes into our lives has taken him away. You can try to make sense of that. There is none,' he concludes.

The Courier Mail pays tribute to Hughes, calling him 'a little legend'

The front page of the Courier Mail calls Australia 'numb' after the shocking news of Hughes' death.

Andrew Carswell tells the story of his devoted father, Greg, who was always by his son's side.

A banana farmer by trade, Hughes Snr was an ever-present figure throughout Hughes' journey from successful schoolboy cricketer to his final innings in Sydney.

'For all the cricketing legends that surrounded him and the brother he shared a home and a deep kinship with, Greg Hughes was always Phillip’s best mate,' the moving article reads. 

The Australian leads with a picture of Hughes in front of the national flag, referring to 'an innings cut short'

The Australian paints a picture of Hughes as a tremendously popular figure in the cricketing fraternity and beyond.

With comment from Australian captain and friend Michael Clarke, Will Swanton and Brent Read pull together quotes from figures including Ian Botham, Darren Lehmann and Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott.

They also quote Jim Maxwell, broadcaster for ABC Radio, whose voice will be familiar to listeners of Test Match Special.

'This is one of the worst days in Australian sport. It’s bad enough in sport when someone is killed in an accident but you’re actually playing the game, and it’s the least of anything you would expect. For this to actually happen in a match on a big stage, and at a point where he was playing so well ... it just leaves you absolutely numb.'
