Lukas Podolski and Alexis Sanchez are warming up for Arsenal's clash with Tottenham... by taking a dip in an ice bath.

£30million signing from Barcelona Sanchez will take part in his first North London derby on Saturday, while Podolski will be keen to feature after struggling against Southampton in the Capital One Cup.

And the duo looked relaxed as they prepared for the Premier League game. Podolski posted on Instagram: 'Take on each day & challenge with a smile. Ice bath recovery with Sanchez! It's a bit 'Chile' in here. Have a 'warm' day everyone !!'

Sanchez has scored four goals for Arsenal so far this season, including a stunning free-kick at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday night.

The game between Arsenal and Tottenham starts at 17.30pm.
