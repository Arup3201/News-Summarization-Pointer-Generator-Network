He's got a reputation for putting down MPs on both benches with his cries of 'Order! Order!' in the Commons chamber.

But Speaker John Bercow showed he has the remarkable ability to impersonate the parliamentary style of the Tory MPs he keeps in check.

Mr Bercow's impressions, performed while he was giving a talk to German students, may do little to endear him to the Conservative Party.

However, his mimicry of Education Secretary Michael Gove, Father of the House Sir Peter Tapsell and Jacob Rees-Mogg was clearly in jest.

Wordplay: Commons speaker John Bercow was recorded doing impressions of Tory MPs during a speech in Germany

After viewing the footage, Mr Gove admitted: 'John has got me to a tee'.

The mini 'speeches' 
that Mr Bercow gave to the students at the Hertie School of Government 
in Berlin were strikingly similar to genuine statements the MPs had made
in Parliament - with one of the examples dating back to 1998.

In his assessment of Mr Gove, the Speaker said he was an 'extremely capable performer in Parliament' who can sometimes thought of as patronising.

'Michael will sort of lavish the person with superficial praise', he explained, adding that Mr Gove has 'a capacity for referring to other members in terms that are elaborate and nominally polite, but which if reflected upon seem to be pretty damming.'

Secretary of state Michael Gove was described by Mr Bercow as 'an extremely capable performer'

Giving an impression of Mr Gove in action Mr Bercow began: 'Well that's a typically acute observation by the honourable gentleman, well I congratulate the honourable gentleman, he's certainly brought to my notice a matter of considerable importance.'

Mr Bercow added that the matter in question would normally have been 'as banal a matter as can possibly have been raised at any time that afternoon.'

And Mr Gove himself appeared to be impressed telling the Guardian: 'I'm afraid John has absolutely got me to a tee. He's a very good mimic - and a very good speaker.'

Mr Bercow then turned his attention to Jacob Rees-Mogg who he described as being 'well-liked', but regarded by the Labour party as 'a curious figure who has sort of wandered into the house from another century'.

Mr Rees-Mogg is in Mr Bercow's view an 'extraordinary character', but one who could be regarded as something of a 'young fogey'.

'He dresses in a very old fashioned way,'Mr Bercow explained. 'Often with a waist coat and he's always got his hankerchief in the right place.

'He's got a habit of getting up and asking questions in a manner that would have been done 50-year-ago.'

A typical Jacob Rees-Mogg question was in the Speaker's opnion: 'Is my right hon friend aware that it invariably falls to this great party of ours to rescue the country from the ravages of debt and despair, which it's been the historic failing of the socialists?'

That indeed bore an undeniable similarity to a question asked by Mr Rees-Mogg in March 2011.

Sir Peter Tapsell, the oldest MP in the Commons, was last to receive the Bercow treatment.

'Sir Peter's manner, you talk about old fogey's or codgers, I wouldn't dream of making such a disobliging comment ,' the speaker said.

Ripe for the picking: Tory MP's  Jacob Rees-Mogg and Sir Peter Tapsell also received the Bercow treatment

His example of a typical question by 
the 83-year-old MP for Hove was: 'Is my honourable friend aware that in 
1955 when I served as personal assistant to Sir Anthony Eden, he advised
me then that ad hominem attacks upon the character of one's opponents 
was invaraiably conter productive.'

Again the Hansard parliamentary records show that Sir Peter asked a strikingly similar question back in February 1998.'

Speaker
Mr Bercow was speaking at the Hertie School of Governance in February 
this year, but the video was only recently uploaded to YouTube.

told
the students that MPs who are 'very personally nasty' tend to become 
disliked, while those who express themselves with a degree of wit tend 
to get away with more scathing remarks.

Bercow launches into an impression during his talk at the German university. His own verbal conduct as speaker of the house has been the cause of much citicism

And he proudly recalled the time he 
was forced to call David Cameron to order after the Prime Minister 
labelled Ed Balls a 'muttering idiot'.

Sadly
Mr Bercow's own oratory skills in the Commons have been called into 
question a great deal recently with many regarding them as lacking in 
both wit and delicacy.

He has been accused of 'flying off the handle' with angry outbursts that contain scathing and unnecessarily derogatory remarks.

Some have even speculated that problems in his own marriage are behind many of his vitriolic attacks.

Some have speculated that problems in Mr Bercow's marriage to wife Sally are behind many of his vitriolic outbursts at MPs

He has also been called into question over his use of expenses.

It emerged yesterday that he has billed the taxpayer for stays at some of the world’s most exclusive hotels.

Documents reveal that the Commons Speaker has stayed at a string of five-star establishments during official travels costing the taxpayer £96,000 since 2010.
