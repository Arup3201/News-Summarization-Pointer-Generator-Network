Former Bolton Wanderers striker Kevin Davies accepts he was no shrinking violet but says that referees have gone too long without punishing the 'dark arts' used by defenders inside the penalty area to stop strikers at free-kicks and corners.

Now 37 and still playing for League One Preston North End, Davies reveals he received a litany of black eyes, sore ribs, stamped-on toes and even scratch-marks down the neck during a career in which he has been regularly blocked off by as many as three defenders at a time at set-pieces.

He thinks if the laws of the game had been applied correctly, he would have won at least an extra 50 penalties during his eventful career.

Davies admits he is torn by the issue of penalty-area grappling. 

On the one hand, he thinks the physicality of English football is what makes it special; on the other, he realises it is getting to the stage now where honest forwards like himself face an impossible job without more protection from officials, and campaigns like Sportsmail's 'Hands Off In The Box'.

'The defender's job is to stop you scoring and they will cross the boundaries if allowed to. There is a dark art to how they do it,' says Davies, who regularly topped the Premier League charts for both fouls earned and fouls conceded.

'I've lost count the number of times I've had one defender in front of me, another one behind, and a third one at the side, using his elbows. Some of them don't even have any intention of going for the ball – their only purpose is to stop you getting a couple of yards for a run on goal. It shouldn't be allowed when the defender is holding you and not even looking at the ball.

'I was always having my shirt pulled. People have their opinion on me but if I am holding my ground and people are all over me, it is still a foul even if I refuse to go down. It would be given as a foul on the halfway line so it should be the same in the penalty area.

'I'd probably be able to find at least 50 occasions where I deserved a penalty but didn't get one. I've spoken to (former referee) Mark Halsey about it, I understand now officials don't want to give penalties unless they are 100 per cent sure because if they get one wrong, they might not be given a game the following week.'

During his career, Davies has seen a growing trend of strikers falling to the ground looking for penalties. It's something he has never done but given the treatment dished out, he can see why with increasingly underhand tactics from markers, it is considered an option by others.

'The most frustrating thing is I never tried to buy a foul or con the referee. I was too proud to go down if I felt the contact, it'd be my mission to fight back even when they wrestled me,' he explains.

'And the irony is now that I am towards the end of my career and looking to go into coaching or management, I would want one of those defenders in my team, who would do anything to stop a goal.'

Centre-forward Davies played for seven clubs but was best known for his decade at Bolton between 2003 and 2013, particularly under Sam Allardyce when he epitomised the club's spirit. He took no prisoners on the football pitch but was equally sinned against by ruthless defenders.

'I wasn't one to complain but I know Sam (Allardyce) sent a dossier to the referees' body after one particular match to highlight the treatment I was getting. He included a picture of me with scratch-marks all down my neck.

'A lot of it's about the way defenders have been brought up. If they have had an old-school defender running their youth team, it will be ingrained in them to stick tight and not give anyone an inch.

'Ryan Shawcross has been highlighted recently but it is a difficult habit to get out of for a defender. It is like they can't stop themselves. From a corner, you are assigned a man and it's your job to stop them any way possible.

Referees are being urged to clamp down on the dark arts used in the penalty area after Sportsmail launched our Hands Off In The Box campaign on Monday.

'There might be 18 or 20 players in the box all jostling. It is tough for referees but I guess if they do start giving penalties against defenders, it will stamp it out.'

Teams like Arsene Wenger's Arsenal hated to play against Bolton when Allardyce was in charge. 

Davies was also the subject of rough treatment but he preferred to fight his own battles rather than complain.

The one exception led to him getting in hot water after a fall-out with referee Mark Clattenburg after having a goal disallowed for Bolton against Fulham.

'We were fighting relegation and I scored in the last minute which would have taken us up several places in the table. But Mark Clattenburg disallowed it because Brede Hangeland fell over as I challenged him – and that after been genuinely kicked about during the game without going down!' he recalled.

'I was angry and said so because Mark Clattenburg seemed to book me in every game – I received a suspended ban for letting my feelings known.'

Davies fears enforcing a 'Hands Off In The Box' campaign won't be as simple as it sounds, however.

'I remember Hermann Hreidarsson being sent off for Charlton after elbowing me in the face (Davies fractures his cheekbone). Later in the game, I want up Amdy Faye, I barely touched him but he screamed and I was sent off to even things up.

'That is the danger for referees, that in their attempt to clean things up in the penalty area, they don't just try to even things up for the sake of it.'
