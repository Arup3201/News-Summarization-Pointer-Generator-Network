Adventurer Alex Honnold achieved the impossible when he became the first person to free climb the challenging El Sendero Luminoso route.

The Shining Path climb, as its known, reaches 2,500 feet at its highest point and is widely recognised as one of the most difficult climbs in the world.

But professional climber Alex scaled the impressive Mexican rock face in just under three hours.

Climber Alex Honnold achieved the impossible, scaling a 2,500 ft climb in just under 3 hours - without a rope!

Alex is the only person in the world to have successfully free-soloed this dangerous route

The video begins with sweeping views of the breathtaking cliff, and pans in to an understandably nervous Alex.

'I'd heard about it years ago,' he said. 'The hard multi-pitch that was, like, a test piece.'

'It's always represented the next step in technical climbing to me.

'It might be too scary, but I'm going to put a bunch of work into it and see if it's even possible.'

Alex and his friend initially climbed up with ropes to assess and clean the rock surface 

Although Alex initially described the conditions as 'sub-optimal,' he decided to persevere

For Alex and his friend, that meant embarking on a rock climb - with ropes, at least initially - to assess the surface of the rock and clean out any debris and loose rocks.

'I kept picturing myself without a rope,' Alex said after completing his test run. 'I'd get really scared.'

Alex's friend, Cedar, shared his apprehension.

'When I was cleaning the wall for Alex, I was cleaning every little thing,' his friend said.

'Anything that looked loose or any piece of dirt, I was trying to clean it off the wall. I want my buddy to live.

'It’s just kind of weird, helping your friend do something that you know could potentially lead to his death.'

'At some point during the day when I was up there, I was like 'I'm ready,'' he said in the video

The 2,500 foot climb to the summit of El Toro is widely recognised as one of the most difficult in the world

Although Alex's first assessment of the cliff face is less than ideal, describing the rock as 'quite damp' and 'sub-optimal,' he decided to persevere.

'At some point during the day when I was up there, I was like 'I'm ready, I'm sick of hanging around on ropes,'' he said.

'It went from being sort of an intimidating idea to being kind of excited to do this.'  

Alex is also the only known person to have climbed the Yosemite Triple crown - three of the park's most famous peaks - without a rope.
