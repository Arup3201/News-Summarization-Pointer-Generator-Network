A stray dog from Chicago covered in matted fur and soaked in urine went through a miraculous transformation after being saved by animal care workers and will now live in a new and loving home thanks to her story becoming viral on social media.

When Ellen the dog, 2, was discovered as a stray walking through the Chicago streets she was covered in matted fur and soaked in urine. Animal workers at the Trio Animal Foundation couldn't even tell if she was a girl or a boy.

NBC reports that Ellen was once described as being a 'clump of pungent urine-soaked matted fur.'After being found by animal control in July, 8.5 pound Ellen was shed of her fur and her dramatic transformation became viral shortly after being posted on social media.

Hidden: When animal rescuers found Ellen, she was so covered in fur that they could not tell if she was a girl or a boy

Severely abused: Ellen was covered in matted and urine soaked fur and was very hungry

Matted: Ellen's fur was stuck together and weighed a total of two pounds

Grooming: Ellen's grooming took two hours of hard work from rescuers

A posting about her rescue has over 3,000 likes on Facebook.

'Flies and gnats swarmed around the pup and what appeared to be the dog’s back legs dragged on the floor and left a watery trail… just like a snail,' wrote Sue Naiden of the Trio Animal Foundation.

Ellen remained brave throughout her whole transformation and didn't once threaten the staff with barks or bites.

'Even though we had to pull out fur that had grown 2 inches down Ellen’s ear canal and shave matted fur away from her irritated paper-thin skin, never once did Ellen growl or show her teeth,' wrote Naiden.

The grooming took an hour and a half and groomers shaved away two pounds of fur.

'The amount of grooming tools that [the groomer] had to use to break through the hard shell of fur was unbelievable, ‘Naiden wrote.

'The first time that she could feel the touch of my hand on her newly shaven back… She looked me in the eyes and it was as if she was saying thank you… Her past abuse was literally being shaved away,' she added.

Heavy load: Ellen was walking around with two pounds of fur she is now relieved to have shaved off and tossed aside

Starting to emerge: After having fur shaven from her face, Ellen is able to breathe easily once again

Road to recovery: After being groomed, bathed, and given vaccinations, Ellen will be able to live her life in a happy home

After being given more baths and getting up to date on her vaccinations, Ellen was taken to Naiden's home for further care until finding a permanent residence.

Thanks to Ellen's story being such a hit on social media, hundreds applied to take the rescued puppy into their home.

The foundation narrowed it down to three homes and it wasn't long before they found a perfect match.

NBC reports that their project's rescue division, Project Rescue Chicago, found Ellen a home with another young dog named Linus who she quickly befriended.

'Ellen’s eyes lit up, and she ran right to him,' Naiden wrote.

'It was love at first site and she made it very apparent that this was the family that she wanted to call her own… it was then that our mighty girl picked her forever home.'

Naiden said that Ellen is a special dog and that she will miss her very much.

'We will so miss seeing this resilient girl running around and jumping on the laps of those that aided in her recovery and fell in love with her. By far… saving Ellen is one of our proudest accomplishments,' she wrote.
