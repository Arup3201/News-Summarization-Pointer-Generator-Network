Peter Hayman has been named as one of a group of paedophiles alleged to have sexually abused young boys at Dolphin Square

The diplomat Peter Hayman sexually abused young boys at an apartment complex near Parliament, an alleged victim has claimed.

Hayman, who died in 1992, was investigated by police in 1978 for possessing inappropriate literature, but was not prosecuted.

He has been named  as one of a number of paedophiles by a man, now in his forties, who claims to have been abused over a period of three years at Dolphin Square.  

The information has been passed to Scotland Yard to consider as part of its investigation into historic allegations of sexual abuse at Westminster. 

Hayman, referred to as a diplomat, was pointed out in a photograph shown to man, 'Nick', by Exaro, an investigative website.

'He used to like to kiss and to touch, liked me to do that to him. 

'But it would always culminate in being raped. That is what happened all the time. 

'That was normal,' he said.  

Starting in 1979, when he was just 11, Nick claims to have been abused by a number of VIPs in the luxury apartment complex. 

'Hayman was rather cold, but then a lot of them were - emotionless. 

'He does not feature big for me, as some of the others do. He was not one of the nasty ones,' he added. 

At the time he thought Hayman was an MP for all the time he spent mixing with politicians, he said. 

'I learned his name over a number of sessions,' he said, adding he was often raped at 'abuse parties' where two senior Conservative MPs sexually assaulted him. 

The men, who are alleged to include a former Cabinet minister, cannot be named for legal reasons.  

In 1981 Hayman was ousted as a member of the Paedophile Information Exchange (PIE), an organisation which promoted sex with children, under parliamentary privilege. 

Three years earlier, he had been investigated by police after a package of 'obscene literature' was found on a bus and traced back to him.

In 1984, the Oxford-graduate was convicted of gross indecency following an incident in a public lavatory. 

Conservative MP Geoffrey Dickens (left) revealed Hayman's connection to the Paedophile Information Exchange in 1981. It was alleged Sir Thomas Hetherington (right) did not agree to Hayman being prosecuted over a package of 'obscene literature' in what the alleged victim claimed was part of a cover-up

Sir Thomas Hetherington, the then director of public prosecutions, did not agree to to Hayman being prosecuted and Nick claims this was part of an attempt to protect a ring of high-placed paedophiles.

The failure of investigators to prosecute Hayman over the package left Nick 'feeling numb'.

'I know times change, and if you were caught today leaving that sort of thing on a bus you would be arrested and charged.

'If he had been arrested, would he have given up the others? I doubt it. Would his arrest have led to the disruption of the group which might have made a difference? It could have done.

'Really, it does not surprise me that they did not do anything because of who else was involved, and it just adds to the growing list of missed opportunities for it to end. 

'It was all just a cover-up, whether to protect the group or protect the establishment’s reputation.'

Dolphin Square was last week named as one of the locations where abuse was carried out. 

Investigation into what occurred in the complex decades ago forms part of Operation Fairbank, a large scale investigation into allegations of abuse by high-placed public figures.
