Retired doctor Peter Williamson thought he was going to be mugged

A retired doctor who assaulted a taxi driver with a walking stick because he thought that he would be late for a performance of a Puccini opera has walked free from court.

Peter Williamson, 70 next month, sat stony-faced at the hearing, wearing a dark suit coupled with a cream pocket square as he pleaded guilty to assault with occasioning actual bodily harm.

Hammersmith Magistrates Court heard Willamson flagged down Kevin Johnson's cab at 4.45pm on June 17 at Raynes Park to take him to an open air performance of Puccini's La Fanciulla del West (The Girl of the Golden West) in Holland Park, west London that commenced at 7.30pm.

En route, Willamson announced that he had no money and needed to stop at a cashpoint. As they were driving up Warwick Road near Earls Court Williamson became rude and aggressive shouting at the cab driver:

Tom Gill, prosecuting, told the court that Williamson 'shouted at the victim 'where are we you f*****g c***' and demanded 'Where are you f*****g taking me.

'The victim could not understand why Dr Williamson was getting so irate and wanted to get him out of the taxi as soon as possible. He needed to get to the opera for 7pm and it was only 5.20pm.'

Mr Johnson pulled up at a cashpoint near Sainsbury's on Kensington High Street, west London.

As Williamson got out, a man was already at the cashpoint and he wandered off up the street.

Mr Johnson got out the car to show him the way but as he approached Williamson the retired doctor raised his walking stick and struck the taxi driver.

When Mr Johnson touched his head, he found blood. A member of the public called the police and the victim was taken to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital where he was given two stitches.

Taken into custody, Williamson said that he thought Mr Johnson was going to rob him and steal his pin number.

Defence lawyer Edgar Fernando said Williamson, who is a fellow of the Royal Institute, was suffering from mouth and lung cancer.

He added: 'It was a single blow. He admits assault and said he feared his bank card and pin would be taken away from him. He acted in self-defence although it was excessive.

'In his 71 years he has committed no offence. He has shown remorse, he did not want to cause injury and admits he acted in an antisocial way.

Williamson received an 18 week sentence, suspended for a year. He must also observe a three-month curfew, from the hours of 8pm through to 6am, and pay his victim £200 compensation

'He has said whether he is given a 12 month prison sentence or not he will not commit an offence again. He is stressed to be here and feels his standing in the community has suffered by the reports, he has been punished enough.'

He added his bank balance was minus £700 and he was living off a pension of £170.

Williamson was jailed for 18 weeks suspended for a year at Hammersmith Magistrates Court (above)

Chairman of the bench Joanne Varley told Williamson: 'The starting point for this particular category is 26 weeks imprisonment.

'However for 71 years you have been of extremely good character, [and] of good conduct, you have shown remorse, it was single blow and you pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity.

'However, as I have mentioned before, on the other side of things you used your walking stick as a weapon towards a man doing his public duty, namely being a taxi-driver.'

Williamson received an 18 week sentence, suspended for a year. He must also observe a three-month curfew, from the hours of 8pm through to 6am, and pay his victim £200 compensation plus a victim surcharge of £80 and costs of £85.
