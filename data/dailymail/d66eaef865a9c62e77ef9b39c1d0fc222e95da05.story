Warning: Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe says forthcoming cuts in police budgets will endanger the public unless ‘radical action’ is taken

The public will be put at risk unless police forces merge to save costs, Britain’s most senior officer warned last night.

Scotland Yard commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe called for the traditional landscape of policing to be ripped up, replacing 43 forces across England and Wales with nine regional ‘super forces’.

He has warned that forthcoming cuts in police budgets will endanger the public unless ‘radical action’ is taken.

Setting out his blueprint for reform, he said there has been a shift in the types of crime that officers deal with, and offences such as cybercrime and online child sexual exploitation often transcend force boundaries. 

Echoing a recent report by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary which said forces were stuck in a time warp, using out-dated methods to deal with modern-day offences, Sir Bernard said that criminals are moving from the shotgun robberies of the past to more sophisticated offences – and police need to catch up.

‘There’s a bigger risk to public safety if we don’t take radical action,’ he said. ‘We’ve saved hundreds of millions already, but from 2016 onwards it will be much harder.’

Eight years ago, the Labour government tried unsuccessfully to streamline the number of forces in England and Wales.

But since then there have been renewed calls to consider the idea.

The Commissioner’s intervention comes as Home Secretary Theresa May faces MPs on the Home Affairs Select Committee today. She will be questioned about cuts after the chief of Lincolnshire police warned last week that his force would be out of business if budgets shrink. 

On Wednesday, the Home Office will tell forces about more cuts, with police fearing they will be bigger than the 20 per cent reductions suffered since 2010.

Police chiefs have warned that the scale of the cuts to come could see neighbourhood policing decimated and patrols axed amid fears there might only be enough officers to respond to emergencies.

Sir Bernard cited domestic abuse as an example where many agencies can be involved in a case. ‘Society’s ability to reduce abuse is much more than a policing issue,’ he said. 

‘It’s about a range of agencies – from social services to mental health – having the capacity to intervene early. If we retrench in isolation, the risks to public safety can only increase.’

He warned that police could lose council-funded CCTV cameras because local authorities face further tough spending cuts.

‘We have to have a shared view of the risks to public safety, from countering terrorism to child protection,’ he said. ‘We need to be transparent about these risks with the public, politicians and the media, so we can together make informed choices about our priorities. 

'Our partners face their own cost pressures, and the big concern is that if we don’t work together, with a shared view of the risks, public safety will suffer.’

Officer numbers in London have been kept at 32,000 so far, but levels will have to drop as the Yard loses a third of its budget by 2020.

Of the £800million in new cuts, the most optimistic private assessment is the Met can save £400million, leaving it to find another £400million by 2020.
