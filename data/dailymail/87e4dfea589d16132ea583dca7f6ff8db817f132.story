Employment minister Esther McVey today admitted she wanted to become Prime Minister.

The glamorous former TV presenter, appearing on ITV’s Loose Women this afternoon, said she wanted to see more women in top jobs.

Miss McVey was asked by Janet Street Porter – who was the MP’s boss when she started in television – if she had designs on Number 10.

The Tory cabinet minister said: ‘To be honest, it is not as simple as that. But if I had to do a yes or no I’ll be honest and say “yes”.’

David Cameron was asked about Miss McVey’s admission today. He said there was ‘lots of talent in Tory Party’. He said he did not want to put a ‘limit on anyone's ambition’.

Miss McVey, who is not married and has no children, had earlier admitted making ‘sacrifices’ to succeed in politics.

Panellist Jamelia Niela Davis said: ‘Do you not feel that it is different as a woman being in politics – that it is much more difficult, that you do have to make different sacrifices to men?’

She said: ‘I guess we all do sacrifices in one way or another. I have other sacrifices – I live between two places, it’s difficult because there are always lots of people wanting to criticise what you do.

‘So there are sacrifices there. But if you want to do and you believe in it then I say have the courage of your convictions and go for it.’

The minister added: ‘Those are sacrifices I am prepared to give because I believe in the cause.’

Loose Women presenters Ruth Langsford and Coleen Nolan questioned Miss McVey about her plans to inspire young girls to aim higher

Miss McVey appeared on the programme to push her new campaign to break open traditionally male professions for women.

It comes after she said girls should be encouraged to run around and climb trees as it could help them have more confidence at the workplace in later life. 

Miss McVey said there is evidence men are more likely to put themselves forward for promotion at work, because they have been 'pushing the boundaries' from a young age.

A traditional upbringing in which boys tear around and make dens, but girls sit quietly with their parents has an impact in later life, with women sometimes reluctant to put themselves forward because they are 'looking for acceptance', she said.

Recent research has shown that men are more likely to embellish their CVs than women when applying for a job.

Head-hunters have also said they check men's CVs for longer than women's because men are more likely to exaggerate their experience while women underplay theirs.

'There is an element of confidence there', the Conservative cabinet minister said. 

'I thought it was very revealing that head-hunters check through a woman's CV for something like 25 minutes to analyse because the chances are she will play down her achievements.

'Whereas it can take two-and-a-half hours to check a bloke's because they'll write about things as if they have done them, when in fact that would be a promotion', she said in an interview with the Mail.

David Cameron, asked about Miss McVey's admission, said he did not want to put a limit on anyone's ambition

'I think girls, whether it's the way they're brought up, they sit quietly beside mum and dad and speak when they're spoken to, and boys are allowed to run around outside and climb trees and make dens, and that actually does have an impact later on in life where girls are frequently looking for acceptance by others, whereas boys are much more naturally pushing the boundaries.'

Miss McVey will appear on ITV's Loose Women tomorrow as part of a series on election issues. 

She will launch the #notjustforboys campaign, intended to boost the number of women in jobs where they are under-represented such as construction science, IT and engineering in which 12million jobs will be created in the next decade.

The minister said these choices need to be influenced at a young age.

As well as their upbringing, she said girls need to be encouraged to choose 'the right subjects at GCSE and A-Level so you don't limit your choices later in life, because these are the fast-growing areas, the ones with the greatest opportunities and the ones paying the most money', she said.

'That's where advanced economies are going, we've got to make sure our young people are up to speed and can compete in the jobs market.'

She said misconceptions that tech industries were not glamorous were being rapidly broken down, and girls working in IT were increasingly being seen as 'the new It girls'.

'I would like to think the IT girl is the new It girl', she said. 'It is about being powerful and creative, not just an attractive image but being in charge of your own destiny.

'There's a lot of people who are getting to 18 or 20 and saying if only I'd known, if only I'd got the right subject grades at a levels I would have taken those options. We just want to make sure that girls are going forward.

'Among engineering professionals only 7 per cent of women are working in that area. Yes it has gone up since 2011, but that's 93 per cent of women who might think "I would have done that". 

'So many people like to use the latest phones or programmes, we are saying don't just be the consumer of technology, be the creator and think of the opportunities that will open up for you.'
