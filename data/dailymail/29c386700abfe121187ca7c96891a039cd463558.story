Welsh cancer patients are flooding into English hospitals for treatment they are being denied at home.

The number crossing the border has quadrupled from just 3,471 a decade ago to 15,450 last year.

The exodus is fuelled by a lack of access to the National Cancer Drugs Fund, which funds treatments rejected by the NHS or awaiting approval.

And almost 50 per cent of Welsh patients must wait six weeks or more for vital scans and tests compared with a 1 per cent figure in England.

Delays: Fifty times more Welsh patients than English face long waits for potentially life-saving cancer scans

It is thought that many more cross-border patients do not show up in the official statistics because they have moved to England permanently or use a second address.

Simon Burns, the Tory MP who obtained the figures through a parliamentary question, said they were an indictment of the Labour-controlled Welsh Assembly.

‘This has been the result of the serious problems in the way the health service in Wales is run by the Labour administration,’ he said. ‘This is the latest scandal showing the disparity in care after the waiting times were shown to be appalling.

‘It’s all very well having free prescriptions in Wales, but people would rather be treated more quickly and get the drugs they need. I’m worried that this is the kind of service we can expect if Labour win the election.’

In addition to the cancer patients, 5,419 people from Wales came to England for outpatient diagnostics in 2009-10. This had risen to 10,424 by 2012-13.

The Royal College of Surgeons has raised concerns over Welsh waiting lists, highlighting the cases of 152 patients who have died in the past five years waiting for operations.

Surge: Almost 16,000 people a year are now crossing the border to access the English NHS

Welsh patients can be referred to English hospitals by their GP but otherwise must have an English address to get treatment.

They wait considerably longer in A&E and Wales has repeatedly missed the target that 95 per cent of patients should be seen within four hours. In January a 58-year-old man died after waiting four hours in an ambulance outside the Princess of Wales Hospital in Bridgend because there was no room.

Hospitals in Wales also have higher death rates although the exact figures are not known and the Welsh administration claims they cannot be compared with those in England.

Sir Bruce Keogh, the medical director of England, has called for an investigation.

GPs in Wales normally refer cancer patients to local services but can go out of the area – and to England – for specialist care.

The GP making the referral will pay for the services their patient receives, allowing them to purchase cancer treatment from an English provider by agreement.

If a GP will not or cannot make a referral for treatment in England a patient can take matters into their own hands and ‘find’ an address in England.

The address - rented, owned or through staying with family, is then used to register with a GP in England.

Once accepted and registered with a GP, the patient will have access to the services that doctor commissions and pays for in the same way any English patient might.

Such a patient should be registered with only one GP and would have to de-register from their Welsh doctor before switching.

Andrew Wilson, of the Rarer Cancers Foundation, said: ‘Given the inequality in access to cancer treatments, it is little surprise that Welsh patients are being forced to travel to England for the treatment they need.

‘It is a national scandal that Welsh patients are not able to benefit from treatments that are routinely available in England.

‘The Welsh Assembly Government needs to take urgent action to prevent Welsh cancer services falling further behind.’

Last summer the foundation found that in England an average of 29 patients were given new drugs for every 100,000 of the population. In Wales it was just 7 per 100,000. The long waiting times in Wales have been highlighted by Ann Clwyd, Labour MP for Cynon Valley.

Miss Clwyd has accused University Hospital Wales of treating her husband Owen Roberts ‘like a battery hen’ prior to his death in October 2012.

Miss Clwyd has received numerous letters from Welsh patients who felt forced to pay for private tests to avoid long waits.

Others said they had had to use English hospitals.

NHS Wales last month announced a review of the way it deals with NHS complaints.

A Welsh Government spokesman said: ‘The [parliamentary] figures represent a small amount of the total cancer activity for patients living in Wales.

The vast majority receive treatment in Wales; there were around 141,000 admission episodes for a primary diagnosis of cancer for Welsh residents in Wales in 2012-13. 

‘There will be very strong clinical reasons why a patient will need to be treated in England.

‘What remains most important, as set out in our Cancer Delivery Plan, is that Welsh patients receive treatment based on individual need.’

Over the past three years the National Cancer Drugs Fund has given almost 50,000 cancer patients in England access to life-prolonging drugs.

Registered in London: Annie Mulholland is signed up to a London GP which allows her to access better treatment

Annie Mulholland has spent all her adult life in Wales but switched addresses to England to get a potentially life-saving cancer drug.

The ovarian cancer sufferer says a postcode lottery in Wales stopped her having Avastin.

She registered with a GP in London last year after ‘finding’ an address as a base in England.

That resulted in her being prescribed the drug and the 61-year-old from Cardiff was given the ‘wonderful’ news this week that she is in remission. But Mrs Mulholland, who runs a support group for ovarian cancer sufferers, says many women in Wales have not had her luck.

‘I have nothing but praise for my GP in Wales and NHS staff but they are often not able to prescribe treatments available in England and it affects the care they can give,’ she said. ‘Funding is patchy, there’s a postcode lottery.

‘I decided to become a permanent visitor in Wales and an absent resident in London to get the hospital, and treatment, I wanted. Anyone in Wales can do what I’ve done.’
