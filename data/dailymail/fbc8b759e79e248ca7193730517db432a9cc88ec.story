A convicted thief was let off jail yesterday after a court heard he could be the 'next Banksy.

Aspiring street artist Justin Lewis, 19, was arrested for snatching a £560 iPhone from a shop display.

But Lewis - who uses the nickname Enemie - walked free from court because of his graffiti skills.

A court heard Lewis has painted dozens of pieces of art around his home city of Newport, south Wales.

Art or vandalism? Two examples of teenager's Banksy-inspired graffiti on walls in Newport, Wales

He was described in court as 'Newport's Banksy' because of his distinctive stencil-style designed.

Newport magistrates heard how Lewis has 31 convictions for 61 offences dating back to 2009.

But his lawyer Sophie Toms claimed he was about to enroll on an 'art course' to get his life back on track.

Magistrates in Newport said they did not want to jail him because of his talent.

Chair of the bench Jennifer Lewis said: 'We have taken into account what your solicitor has said about your art.'

Lewis was given a 12 month community order with 40 hours unpaid community work.

He was told to pay £975 costs including £560 compensation for the iPhone, which was never recovered.

In June last year Lewis was caught spraying graffiti and was given 180 hours of unpaid work, a 12-month community order and told to pay £105 in costs by magistrates in Cwmbran, South Wales after he admitted criminal damage.

He was also warned to stop doing street art despite the fame of Banksy.

Speaking at the time, chairman of the bench Keith Minton told him: 'You are very close to going to prison'.

Since Bristol-born Banksy made his name with his trademark stencil-style 'guerrilla' art in public spaces - on walls in London, Brighton, Bristol and even on the West Bank barrier separating Israelis and Palestinians - his works have sold for hundreds of thousands of pounds.

He has dozens of celebrity collectors including Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie and Christina Aguilera.
