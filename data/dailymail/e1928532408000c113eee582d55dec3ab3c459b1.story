An Egyptian judge bid a journalist being held on terror charges 'Happy World Press Freedom Day' after the reporter made a desperate plea for freedom from his cage.

Mohammed Fahmy is one of three Al-Jazeera journalists being held by the Egyptian authorities after they were charged with altering film footage to support the Muslim Brotherhood.

Mr Fhamy, the Canadian-Egyptian acting Al-Jazeera bureau chief, was allowed to leave his cage in the court room and stood directly before the judge's bench as he told the official that journalists have to speak to all sides to do their jobs.

But his request for bail was unsuccessful, with Judge Mohamed Nagi Shehata refusing to release Mr Fahmy and his fellow Al-Jazeera employees, Baher Mohammed and former BBC reporter Peter Greste.

And the judge even wished Mr Fahy a 'happy' World Press Freedom Day as he denied the request.

The trio face charges of being part of a terrorist group and airing falsified footage intended to damage Egyptian national security.

Egyptian authorities have accused Qatari-owned network Al-Jazeera of providing a platform for the Muslim Brotherhood, which the government has branded a terrorist organisation.

Al-Jazeera denies the claim, and the defendants deny being members of the Brotherhood, saying they were simply doing their job reporting on Egypt's political turmoil.

They are on trial with 17 others and will next appear before a court on May 15.

Last month a judge sentenced 529 people to death for alleged Brotherhood links in a case that was condemned around the world.

Amnesty International has condemned the trial as a 'vindictive farce'.

Hassiba Hadj Sahraoui, Amnesty’s Middle East and North Africa Programme Deputy Director, said: 'What the Egyptian authorities are doing is vindictive persecution of journalists for merely doing their jobs.

'So far, the Prosecution has failed to produce any convincing evidence and the journalists appear to be pawns in the hands of the authorities in their ongoing dispute with Qatar.

'The truth is that Mohamed Fahmy, Peter Greste and Baher Mohamed are prisoners of conscience who must be released immediately and unconditionally.

'This trial is nothing more than posturing by the authorities to gain public support.

'This farce must end and the charges against the three men must be dropped.'

Peter Greste worked for the BBC in Afghanistan, Latin America and Africa, and has won awards for his work.

The 45-year-old Australian, who works for Arab TV channel Al Jazeera, describes the charges as ‘preposterous’ and an international campaign has been launched to secure his release.

At a previous hearing Mr Greste told the judge he had been in Egypt for only two weeks before his arrest.

‘The idea that I could have an association with the Muslim Brotherhood is frankly preposterous,’ he said.

‘Our only desire at this point is to continue to fight and clear our names from outside of prison.’

Other defendants claimed they had been abused and tortured during interrogation.

Mr Greste’s parents had hoped he would be released after Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott took up the case with interim Egyptian President Adly Mansour.
