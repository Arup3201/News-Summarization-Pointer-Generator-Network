Warning: Professor Carrie Paechter, of the department of educational studies at Goldsmiths, University of London

Private school girls who are under intense parental pressure to excel are being driven to eating disorders, an academic has warned.

They are being treated as ‘projects’ by middle-class parents who push them too hard to achieve in music and sport as well as exams, it was claimed.

But the stress of striving to be ‘perfect at everything’ can lead to anorexia, bulimia and binge-drinking, according to Professor Carrie Paechter, of Goldsmiths College, London.

She warned that the pressure to succeed is particularly intense at private schools, where pupils feel they must conform to the stereotype of the straight-A pupil.

Professor Paechter will next week tell the heads of top private schools’ girls they should start telling some girls they are ‘doing too much’.

Girls also need a ‘hard dose of reality’ about the sexist world they face when they leave school, she will tell the annual conference of Girls’ Schools Association.

Speaking ahead of the event, the academic, a professor of education, warned that girls face further pressure to fit in with their classmates and avoid being excluded by cliques.

Girls who are sociable and successful may find friendships more difficult since those who are popular may not actually be well-liked, she said.

Stress is also caused by leading ‘overscheduled’ lives in pursuit of perfection and a desire to ‘live up to expectations’.

‘Girls are under pressure as never before’, Professor Paechter told the Times Educational Supplement.

‘There are girls in private schools who are “projects” of their parents, learning two or three instruments to grade eight standard and excelling in sport and academia because they feel that is what is expected of them, and that is what they expect of themselves.’

‘But a few of them end up in anorexia clinics complaining that their schools only cared about their results.

‘Good schools need to start saying: “You can’t do that many A levels, even if you want to.”’ 

‘The schools need to start looking at girls, saying: “This is too much, you do too many things.”’

She added: ‘In middle-class families it’s not just about doing well at school, they have to be fabulous all-rounders.

‘Schools give them that message to an extent that to stand out from the crowd they must be a fantastic human being as well as doing really well at GCSEs and A levels.’

The professor also said it was important for schools to avoid turning young women who expected to have four children, a fulfilling career and a full social life.

‘If you’re being picked on that’s awful, but if you’re just ordinary you can have a decent time at school, keeping out of it’

‘You want to keep them aspirational, but you want them to be confident enough to say, “I don’t want this”, if it is too much,’ she said.

Girls also need to be warned about the ‘very serious glass ceiling they could confront,’ she added.

In a separate interview, she described research into friendship groups among girls.

‘These friendship groups frequently have low tolerance for difference between group members and keep each other under constant scrutiny, excluding those who don’t make the grade,’ she said.

‘We need to be aware that it is frequently those girls who appear to be the most socially successful for whom this is a problem, and to act rapidly when problems come to our attention. These are likely to be the tip of a much larger iceberg.’ 

Concern: The impact of a demanding school life could drive some school girls to anorexia, it has been warned (file picture)

She added: ‘There is a lot of pressure to be top of the social group, but often girls who are popular aren’t well liked - they’re feared because they’re dominant.

‘One group we studied at a school was very dominant and they kept constant surveillance on each other, checking they had their socks rolled down in the exact way and that their hair was done properly.

‘This was a very affluent school. They all had long blonde hair and highlights and all wore designer clothes outside school. There was pressure to be beautiful all the time or you were letting the group down.

‘One of the girls was whispered about because her ponytail wasn’t how it should be, and it took her all day to realise what was wrong, then she was mortified.

'The “terms” of the group can change overnight without a member realising. Girls further down the pecking order don’t notice how their socks should be.

‘If you’re being picked on that’s awful, but if you’re just ordinary you can have a decent time at school, keeping out of it.’

On its MyDaughter website, offers advice and support to parents of girls, the Girls’ Schools Association points out the ‘danger of expecting “the best” from each girl’.

‘The fall from dizzy heights of success can be a painful experience and undoubtedly it can be lonely at the top,’ it says.‘Our job is to ensure that the girls are ready and armed to cope with such challenges and the inevitable ups and downs.’
