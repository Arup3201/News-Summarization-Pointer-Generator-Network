A Twitter campaign against a children’s plastic surgery game that tells players that liposuction makes people ‘slim and beautiful’ forced Apple to remove the app from its platform last night. 

More than 4,000 Twitter users rallied behind a women’s rights group that called the app sexist and damaging to young women’s self esteem.

The app, which could be downloaded from Apple iTunes, instructs children as young as nine to perform plastic surgery on the image of a woman who has ‘so much extra weight that no diet can help her’.

Outrage: The app, which could be downloaded from Apple iTunes, instructs children as young as nine to perform plastic surgery on the image of a woman whom 'no diet can help'. Above, the advert for the app

Anger: The women's rights group, Everyday Sexism, posted the game on Twitter, urging users to complain to iTunes that the app encourages impressionable young women to develop body issues

The game tells players they can help this ‘unfortunate girl’ by making cuts on problem areas and ‘suck out the extra fat’.

The women’s rights group, Everyday Sexism, posted the game on Twitter, urging users to complain to iTunes that the app encourages impressionable young women to develop body issues.

More than 4,000 people re-tweeted the post and complained about how young women could be damaged by its content.

Apple did not respond to the requests but removed the game from its platform last night.

An outraged Twitter user Sarah Eldred ‏(@sarah_eldred) wrote: ‘Oh dear lord, this is awful! Is this really a game designed for little girls?’

Sue Black (‏@Dr_Black) wrote: ‘This is disgusting and offensive. Please withdraw this product immediately’

And Sara Lin Wilde ‏@SaraLinWilde joined the campaign: ‘Surely you can do better than a game that tells kids how plastic surgery is part of being pretty.’

Response: Apple did not respond to the requests but removed the app from its platform last night

The app called ‘Plastic Surgery & Plastic Doctor & Plastic Hospital Office for Barbie version’ was released earlier this month by the developers Corina Game.

It is marketed at users aged nine and above due to ‘infrequent/ mild realistic violence’.

The Twitter campaign criticised another plastic surgery app on Google Play that can be used by players of all ages.

The game’s description reads: ‘Barbara likes to eat a lot of burgers and chocolates and once she found that she looks ugly. 

‘She can’t make it up with situation any additional second. And today plastic surgeon is going to make operation on her body and face in order to return cute Barbara’s look. She is afraid of all of this.’

This plastic surgery app is estimated to have been installed between 500,000 and 1 million times.

A Google spokesman said: ‘We don’t comment on individual apps, but will remove apps that breach our guidelines.’

However, Google removed also removed the app yesterday.

A Girl Guide’s survey on young women’s body issues and self-esteem found that 87 per cent of girls aged 11-21 think women are judged more on their appearance than on their ability.

And 60 per cent of 11-21 year olds said they have had comments about their appearance shouted at them at school, or have been shouted or whistled at in the street.
