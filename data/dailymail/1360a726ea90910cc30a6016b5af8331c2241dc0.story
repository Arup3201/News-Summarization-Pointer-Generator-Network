One fisherman landed the catch of his life after he reeled in an enormous bluefin tuna that weighed a whopping 1,000lbs.

Marc Towers, 30, wrestled with the huge fish for two hours before he pulled it to the surface of the water off the coast of Canso in Nova Scotia.

It was worth the effort and the wait as the fish is expected to sell for £20,000 in Japan and make 20,000 pieces of sushi.

Neil Cooke, who was on the fishing 
trip with Mr Towers, said: ‘We didn’t realise how big it was until it 
was about 15feet away from the surface.

‘It took Marc two hours to pull in, and we had started to see the shape of it when the skipper said “This could be a big fish”.

‘All of a sudden it broke the surface and everyone said “It’s a monster!”’

The fish was so huge that the crew was unable to haul it onto the boat and had to tie a rope around it to 
drag it four miles back to the dock.

Mr Cooke, 37, added: ‘The deck hand 
made a lasso and tied it around the end of the fish and we dragged it 
through the water back to the dock.’

When the boat arrived back at the 
dock, the fish was lifted by a crane from the water and onto a forklift 
truck which carried the giant fish over to a set a scales.

Mr Cooke, owner of Bournemouth Fishing Lodge in Dorset said: ‘We saw 1,000lb come up on screen which was brilliant.’

The crew transferred the fish to a 
fridge and they are planning on selling it in Japan where Atlantic bluefin tuna  - Thunnus thynnus in Latin – is frequently made into 
sushi.

The pair, who go on fishing trips together, decided to visit Nova Scotia with the aim of catching a bluefin tuna.

They went during the commercial season when fish that are usually set free after being caught are taken back to the dock and sold.

The record for a Bluefin tuna is held by Ken Fraser who caught a 1,496-pound specimen off the coast of Nova Scotia in 1979.

Large and fast: The torpedo-shaped, streamlined body of an Atlantic bluefin tuna is built for speed and endurance

The Atlantic bluefin tuna is one of the largest and fastest fish in the world.

On average, it measures 6.5feet in length and weighs 550lbs, although much larger specimens are not uncommon.

Its torpedo-shaped, streamlined body is built for speed and endurance.

In appearance, they are metallic blue on top and silver-white on the bottom which helps camouflage them from above and below.

They are warm-blooded and can survive in cold waters off Newfoundland and Iceland as well as the tropical waters of the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean Sea.

They migrate and some have been tracked swimming from North American to European waters several times a year.

Bluefin meat is considered a delicacy and overfishing has driven their numbers to critically low levels.

It has been eaten by humans for centuries and today the Japanese eat 80 per cent of the Atlantic and Pacific bluefins caught.

The species is one of the most sought-after by sushi lovers and can sell for up to £16 per piece in high-end Tokyo sushi restaurants.

In the 1970s, demand and prices for large bluefins soared and commercial fishing operations found new ways to catch them.

As a result, stocks have plummeted and international conservation efforts have led to curbs on commercial takes.

In November 2010, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas voted to cut the bluefin fishing quota in the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean by about 4 per cent, from 13,500 to 12,900 metric tons annually.
