Three students have taken extreme selfies to new heights - by snapping a gravity-defying video at the top of Hong Kong's fifth highest building, The Centre.

In a YouTube video, the teenagers scaled the famous 1,135ft skyscraper and are seen perched perilously high, with the a panorama of the city behind them. 

Photographer Daniel Lau used a 'selfie stick' mounted with a camera fitted with a wide-angle lens to capture the stomach churning footage.

Two friends, fellow photographers Anrew Tso and A.S, are shown casually eating bananas at the beginning of the video clip, which has received over 450,000 views since it was posted last week.

The trend for taking extreme selfies has exploded in recent months, especially in Russia, where 'skywalkers', as they are known, climb buildings, cranes and construction sites to take photographs and share online. The death-defying stunts are carried out without safety nets.

In June, 31-year-old Londoner Lee Thompson took the world's first 'selfie with Jesus'.

The travel company boss became an internet sensation when he shared his selfie from the top of Brazil's iconic Christ The Redeemer statue in June.

Mr Thompson convinced the Brazilian tourist board to let him climb the 124ft-high monument and pose for a photograph at the top.

He said the 25-minute climb to the summit was 'extremely hot, eerily quiet and claustrophobic' but he reported that the view was 'incredible' and that the selfie was one of his favourite photos.

The extreme trend  sees photographers posing in a plethora of dangerous situations,  which include getting up close and personal with wild animals.

Twenty-six-year-old Californian Forrest Galante took selfies with a six-metre anaconda in the Amazon, cradling a shark in the Bahamas and coming within a few steps of a Komodo dragon in Indonesia. 

But the craze for taking dangerous selfies has resulted in some tragic consequences.

A couple 'taking a selfie' on the edge of a cliff died when they fell hundreds of feet while their young children watched.

The Polish couple died after falling from the rocky edge in Cabo da Raca, west Portugal.
