This warm, sunny autumn, you have probably gone far longer than usual without a thick coat or woolly jumper.

Good news for most of us – but, it seems, a disaster for high street giants such as Next, which yesterday issued its first profit warning for nearly 20 years.

It’s all down to the unseasonably high temperatures, which have hit demand for winter clothing hard, the retailer said.

Next has issued its first profit warning in nearly 20 years as unseasonably high temperatures have hit the demand for winter clothing 

The admission spells trouble for struggling Marks & Spencer, which is due to release its latest figures on Wednesday next week.

Its chief executive Marc Bolland is under intense pressure to show that its new autumn/winter ranges have struck a chord with shoppers.

Next said that sales in September and October were far poorer than predicted and cut its expectations for the Christmas trading period.

It said profit for the full year could be £25million lower than expected.

Chief executive Lord Wolfson said: ‘It is difficult to explain how the same range that was up in August was down two weeks later – no range is ever perfect, there are always things that can be improved, but this would suggest it was the weather. What we have lost, now even with cold weather we won’t pick up.’

Temperatures soared this week, with forecasters saying the Indian summer could make 2014 one of the hottest years on record.

The admission by Next also spells trouble for Marks & Spencer, which is due to release its latest figures next week 

James McGregor, of consultants Retail Remedy, said last night: ‘Next, like many of its competitors, is feeling the effect of the unseasonably warm weather. 

Later this week temperatures are set to hit 20C in some areas of the south. It’s hard to sell an autumn or winter range in that kind of weather.’

He added that Next was ‘extremely resilient’, however.

Retail analyst Nick Bubb said: ‘If Next has been mildly discomfited by the amazingly mild October weather, we suspect that the likes of M&S and Debenhams have had bigger problems.’

David Alexander, a consultant at retail analysts Conlumino, said: ‘Retailers often point to the weather as a means of explaining away poor performances.

‘In the case of fashion retailers attempting to convince consumers to invest in the latest cosy pieces from their autumn/winter collections, though, unseasonably warm weather at this time of year can inevitably have a significant impact on demand.’

Freddie George, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said: ‘Our view is that the current slippage is completely due to the mild weather. The underlying trend for consumption remains positive.’

He added: ‘It does appear, however, that we are seeing more extreme weather patterns.’
