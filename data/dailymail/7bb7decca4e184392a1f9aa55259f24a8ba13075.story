President Barack Obama said on Friday that the tragic deaths of two black men in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City this year sparked a 'healthy conversation' in America that will allow the country to 'come together and to take a practical approach' to solving race relations issues. 

'This isn’t a situation where people feel good seeing somebody choked and dying,' the president said this afternoon at his year-end press conference. 'I think that troubles everybody.'

Obama also contended that 'people are basically good and have good intentions,' even though 'sometimes our institutions and our systems don’t work as well as they should.'

At his year-end press conference, President Barack Obama contended that 'people are basically good and have good intentions,' even though 'sometimes our institutions and our systems don’t work as well as they should'

During the wide-ranging discussion with the press that preceded the president's departure for his 17-day holiday in Hawaii, Obama reflected on the 'difficult times' that have fallen on the nation in the past year and shared his vision for the first of his final two years in office.

Obama took an optimistic approach to the forthcoming takeover of Republicans in the legislative branch and said he believes 'there are real opportunities to get things done' in the next Congress but again warned Republicans that he won't abandon his principles simply because his party is no longer calling the shots.

'The question is going to be are we able to separate out those areas where we disagree and those areas where we agree. I think there are going to be some tough fights on areas where we disagree,' he predicted.

'If Republicans seek to take health care away from people who just got it, they will meet stiff resistance from me. If they try to water down consumer protections that we put in place in the aftermath of the financial crisis, I will say no,' he said.

Showing just how serious he was, Obama added, 'I’m confident that I’ll be able to uphold vetoes of those types of provisions.'

The president said Republicans' claims that his utilization of executive authority is what is ruining their working relationship with him was disingenuous and that he's 'never been persuaded by this argument that if it weren’t for the executive actions they would have been more productive' in the recent legislative session.

'There’s no evidence of that,' he stated. 'So I intend to continue to do what I’ve been doing, which is where I see a big problem and the opportunity to help the American people, and it is within my lawful authority to provide that help, I’m going to do it. 

'And I will then, side-by-side, reach out to members of Congress, reach out to Republicans, and say, let’s work together; I’d rather do it with you.'

Potentially foreshadowing future executive orders he may issue during his remaining time in office Obama said, 'the question is going to be I think if executive actions on areas like minimum wage, or equal pay, or having a more sensible immigration system are important to Republicans.

'If they care about those issues, and the executive actions are bothering them, there is a very simple solution, and that is: Pass bills. And work with me to make sure I’m willing to sign those bills.'

Likewise, if Republicans want any of their preferred legislative 'initiatives to become law, I’m going to have sign off,' Obama said. 'And that means they have to take into account the issues that I care about, just as I’m going to have to take into account the issues that they care about.'

Turning his attention to the racial tensions now rising to the surface of American dialogue, Obama said they 'are not new phenomenon' but are now at the forefront 'in part because people are able to film what have just been, in the past, stories passed on around a kitchen table.

'And you’re not going to solve a problem if it’s not being talked about,' he added.

The president said that one aspect of the discussion that's been overlooked is that 'the vast majority of people are just trying to do the right thing.'

'Sometimes you've got a police department that has gotten into bad habits over a period of time and hasn’t maybe surfaced some hidden biases that we all carry around,' he admitted. 'But if you offer practical solutions, I think people want to fix these problems.'

Obama acknowledged that it's the job of the White House press core 'to report on all the mistakes that are made and all the bad things that happen and the crises that look like they're popping.'

'But through persistent effort and faith in the American people, things get better,' he insisted.

'The economy has gotten better. Our ability to generate clean energy has gotten better. We know more about how to educate our kids. We solved problems,' he said. 

Obama said that he hopes that the country's track record  will induce 'some confidence' in the New Year that that 'America knows how to solve problems.'

'And when we work together, we can't be stopped,' he said, closing out the news conference on a high note.
