A team of wounded war veterans have taken on a gruelling 600-mile trip across Africa - in para-trikes.

An eight-man team completed the  challenge which started at Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania and ended at Mount Kenya, Kenya.

The epic three-week journey took in stunning sights of zebras sprinting across the Savannah below and included meeting local tribes.

The airborne expedition was organised by Flying for Heroes to help raise funds for the charity Help for Heroes.

Rory Mackenzie, team leader of the eight attempting this impressive expedition, said: 'I'm so lucky to be taking part in such a unique adventure.

'I have only recently taken to the skies having learnt how to pilot a glider and it's very true what they say, once you experience the feeling of flight you are hooked.

'It's wonderful that we have been able to include other veterans with an array of injuries and illnesses.

'I know how life reaffirming these adventures can be and I'm sure every one of the guys will have learnt a little more about themselves at the end of this epic journey.'

Many of the team of eight were new to gliding prior to their African adventure

Across the three weeks, the team not only traversed Kenya's Great Rift Valley and harsh desert conditions, they also battled snakes and scorpions.

Flying for Heroes is a not for profit organisation providing pilot scholarships for wounded veterans and service personnel.

The enterprise was launched in May with an initial eight student pilots and was founded by adventurer Neil Laughton and SkySchool Managing Director Alex Ledger.

It was hard work trekking through the African wilderness, especially when conditions deteriorated

Neil said: 'This project wasn't just about raising much needed funds for many seriously wounded service personnel.

'We hope it will inspire those still battling the physical and psychological damage from their injuries.

'We are extremely pleased to be working with Help for Heroes, who aim to offer support and encouragement to those wounded in the line of duty.'
