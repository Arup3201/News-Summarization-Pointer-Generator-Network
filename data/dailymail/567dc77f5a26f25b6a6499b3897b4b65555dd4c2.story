An 87-year-old woman has expressed her thanks to four 'good looking' policemen who kindly transported her 350 miles cross-country to see her critically sick child.

Helen 'Skeeter' Smith from Panaca, Nevada, was en route to see her son Randy on Friday evening when she got pulled over for speeding and accidentally pranged a patrol car in the process.

Deciding she wasn't safe to drive, one officer transported her a quarter of the way on her journey before she changed to three other vehicles to reach her final destination.

Thankful: Helen 'Skeeter' Smith from Panaca, Nevada, 87, has expressed her thanks to four 'good looking' policemen who kindly transported her 350 miles cross-country to see her critically sick child

'She was very excited to tell me about her dogs, her cat and her hometown,' trooper Andrew Pollard told KUTV.

Smith ran into trouble when she was pulled over for driving too closely to Trooper Jeff Jones' patrol car at about 7pm Friday in the central Utah town of Fillmore.

But after speaking to him she was let go with a warning.

However, as Smith drove away, she accidentally put her car in reverse and hit Jones' patrol car.

She told him where she was going while they dealt with the dent.

Convinced it might not be safe for Smith to drive, Jones arranged for her car to be moved to a secure place and be picked up by her family.

He then drove Smith north to Juab County, where Trooper Jared Jensen picked her up and escorted her to Utah County.

There, they met up with Trooper Chris Bishop, and he drove Smith to Salt Lake County.

Trooper  Pollard then completed the approximately 180-mile journey to Ogden Regional Medical Center with her.

Critically ill: Her son Randy, suffering from an unnamed condition, isn't doing well, but she's glad to be with him for treatment

They arrived at 10:30pm.

'To hold her hand walking into the hospital was very, very rewarding,' Pollard said.

Smith said she was grateful she didn't have to brave the freeway alone late at night.

Plus, she enjoyed her travel companions. 

'Four good-lookin' patrol boys brought me,' she said.

Her son Randy, suffering from an unnamed  condition, isn't doing well, but she's glad to be with him for treatment.
