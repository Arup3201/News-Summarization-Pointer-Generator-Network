Brentford midfielder Tommy Smith has his eyes on a spot of revenge as well as joint-second place in the Sky Bet Championship ahead of Friday's derby with Fulham.

The Bees have won their last three matches to climb to sixth place but Fulham are also in fine form having been revitalised since Kit Symons took over from Felix Magath, whose only win during a disastrous start to the season came at Griffin Park in the Capital One Cup.

'They are a different team now,' Smith said. 'A few of the players under Magath weren't involved then for whatever reason and they have come back in and made a difference and it's showing on the pitch.

'We made a few changes that night as well so it's a completely different game.

'The mood in our camp is very good. It all came together in one week with three good performances back to back which is very pleasing. Now we have one to look forward to on Friday night and we owe them one after the cup game.'

Brentford, who were only promoted from League One last season, would move to within a point of leaders Derby with a victory over their west London rivals and Smith insists they are among the front-runners on merit.

'There was always going to be a big transition from League One to the Championship but we've managed it very well and we are delighted to be sitting where we are in the league,' he added.

'It's getting to that stage of the season where the table is actually a good picture of how well you have done so far, so you are aware of where you are and we want to be near the top.

'It doesn't detract from the game, the big thing is to get the three points and then look at the table and enjoy it after the game.

'Fulham will want to ruffle our feathers, the atmosphere was fantastic last time but we have to resist playing the occasion and not the game.'

Cardiff manager Russell Slade is glad to be back on home turf when his side host Reading.

City have won all three of their home matches since Slade took over, but have picked up just one point on the road.

'We're not helping ourselves with our away form but we're not doing too much wrong and we're pleased we've scored goals at home,' said Slade.

'Reading are a team that like to go forward, play with a nice intensity and score goals, even if their away form again doesn't marry up with their home form.

'But we'll go into the game with confidence as we've done well at home and we want to continue in the same vein.'
