David Cameron and Barack Obama yesterday staged a 35-minute ‘treadmill summit’ side by side at a G8 gathering dominated by the Euro crisis.

Their crunch talks came as a group of influential Conservative MPs with close links to the Prime Minister and Chancellor George Osborne unveiled dramatic emergency proposals to be taken in the event of ‘Eurogeddon’ – the increasingly likely prospect of a currency meltdown.

The ideas include £7 billion cuts in welfare benefits and rejecting EU moves to improve workers’ rights.

The plan was revealed after the American President summoned the Prime Minister for their workout at Maryland’s Camp David to agree how to bounce Germany’s Angela Merkel into taking action to prop up the single currency.

Mr Obama picked up Mr Cameron from the compound’s Maple Cabin where he was staying for a morning run at 7.15am. They walked to the gym together, ran on treadmills and then returned at 7.50am.

No 10 officials refused to say which of the leaders ran faster and hinted that the workout was relatively gentle. ‘It was the kind of workout where you can still have a substantive conversation.’

A senior aide said: ‘They spoke the night before but they wanted to have a further conversation. Some might argue this is not the right forum for talking about Eurozone issues but, as the Prime Minister has said, it is appropriate for the G8 to talk about these issues.’ After leaving the treadmill, Mr Cameron said there was ‘a growing sense of urgency’ over the deteriorating political and financial situation in Greece, which risks spreading to other vulnerable EU countries and damaging the British economy.

‘Action needs to be taken, contingency plans need to be put in place and the strengthening of banks, governance, firewalls – all of those things need to take place very fast,’ the Prime Minister said.

Greece’s caretaker government was sworn in this week after elections failed to produce a viable coalition to run the country. The result of new elections next month could determine whether the country accepts deep spending cuts set as the condition for an international bailout deal – or quits the bloc of 17 countries that use the Euro.

An exclusive poll for today’s Mail on Sunday has found that four in ten people believe Britain and the EU would be better off in the long-run if all Euro nations went back to their own currencies.

The view is backed by former Tory Chancellor Nigel Lawson, who today accuses Mr Cameron of talking ‘complete nonsense’ when describing the prospect of a ‘successful Eurozone’.

The Mail on Sunday Survation poll reveals that one in six voters fear the break-up of the Euro would lead to riots across the continent. It also shows that UK voters back Left-wing French President Francois Hollande’s demand for new investment to boost growth rather than Mrs Merkel and Mr Cameron’s austerity stance.

Asked which EU leader they back, Mr Hollande scores 32 per cent, followed by Mr Cameron on 20  per cent and Mrs Merkel on 16  per cent.

The drastic ‘Eurogeddon’ plan, to be unveiled this week by the Conservative Free Enterprise Group, was written by Tory MPs Kwasi Kwarteng and Liz Truss, both tipped for ministerial promotion.

The group’s supporters include Tory MPs Matthew Hancock and Sajid Javid, senior advisers to Mr Osborne, and George Eustice, a former aide to Mr Cameron.

Mr Kwarteng writes in today’s Mail on Sunday: ‘A currency meltdown would probably deepen recession in Europe. Further cuts in spending would have to be implemented. A cash freeze of benefits for three years would save significant amounts. It seems only fair people receiving benefits should also experience restraint.’

Mr Kwarteng said it could save £7 billion.

The Free Enterprise Group also wants to copy German laws on ‘flexible contracts’ for people who earn less than £1,000 a month.

‘They wouldn’t have to pay any tax, yet employers could release them without any repercussions,’ says Mr Kwarteng. And he argues the Government should reject the EU’s union-backed Working Time and Agency Workers regulations, which he said cost the UK more than £5 billion a year.

Labour attacked the ‘Eurogeddon’ plan. A senior official said: ‘Most of Europe is moving away from austerity measures. Yet some Tories seem to think it is an excuse to bring in extreme Right-wing measures.’

Last night, disagreements between the G8 countries over the crisis appeared as pronounced as ever.

Mr Cameron’s emergency treadmill talks with President Obama came after the Germans sought to prevent the G8 summit from issuing any instructions on the eurozone.

A dismayed President Obama intervened after aides to the G8 leaders sat up until 4am on Friday arguing over details of a communiqué demanding action.

Britain and America are concerned the Euro crisis will drag the world economy into freefall.

Non-Euro countries including  Canada and Japan all wanted to use the summit to force the Germans into action.

A source close to Mrs Merkel admitted the aide talks were ‘free and intense’ – diplomatic speak for a blazing row.

The Germans refused point-blank to let the G8 issue a call to action on the Eurozone, supported by Italy and France.

Britain is now demanding that the Germans let the European Central Bank use quantitative easing to print money and give a monetary boost to the Eurozone economy.

In a further complication, the man appointed by President Hollande as his prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said in an interview that he supported greater trade protectionism. Last week, Mr Cameron said he wanted to lower trade barriers.

Last night, it was revealed that Britain is the only one of the world’s eight major economies set to meet its pledge to spend 0.7 per cent of national income on foreign aid next year. A report issued at the summit shows the average for the G8 last year was just 0.28 per cent.

A No 10 spokesperson said: ‘Britain is proud it has met its commitments, but we want others to do the same.’

But Tory MP Philip Davies fumed: ‘It makes us look like the mugs of the Western world.'

BY FIDELMA COOK

Hair carefully arranged, huge  sunglasses adding to her chic air, the elderly woman had the undoubted look of a lady who lunched.

Once, perhaps, her rendezvous would have been with old friends in a smart restaurant close to Athens’ embassy district. Today her appointment was with charity – but she accepted her handout of bean soup in a plastic bowl with all the grace she could muster.

It was only when she realised that the outside world, in the form of a photographer and myself, were  witnessing her ‘shame’ that she  faltered. Horrified, she turned away, refusing to discuss the  circumstances that had brought  her to this municipal ‘soup kitchen’.

Handouts: Left, a smartly dressed man takes soup in Athens while, right, the elderly kitchen visitor clings to dignity as a fellow diner eats ravenously

‘She has nothing left but her dignity,’ said a worker who approached her on our behalf. ‘She only started coming here in the past few weeks, and it is still so very hard for her. It will be her one meal of the day.

‘But there are more and more like her now. At first it was the immigrants and the illegals; the homeless. Now they’ve been joined by the young, the professionals, the middle class. And every day more come.’ On their knees, but refusing to be beaten by IMF and eurozone demands, the Greeks are clinging on to that dignity.

They are painfully aware that they have been presented to the rest of the world as a work-shy, tax-dodging, culturally corrupt nation who  created their own downfall and  now refuse to pay for it.

But they already have paid for it. A quarter of Greek firms have gone bust in three years; employment is at 22 per cent and rising; new property taxes have hit all, as have massive salary, pension and welfare cuts.

Yet, on the surface, as one walks through Athens’ chaotic streets, all appears surprisingly normal. Shops still trade and the ubiquitous yellow taxis whizz round with passengers.

Xanthia, a 28-year-old journalist on a local newspaper who is now being paid two months in arrears, says: ‘We’re a proud people. I still like to put on a show – sit in the café, all dressed up – it’s something we do, and all looks normal. But stick around for a while and you’ll notice we hold one drink all evening.’

Quietly every day, and the figure is rising, at least 4,000 are fed by the charity of the city, the churches and individual communities. Some say that figure is a woeful underestimate. Schools have been given extra meals for children who have been fainting with hunger.

For Fotis Provatas, vice Mayor of Athens, this aid is not in question. ‘There is an old Greek saying of which I am proud,’ he says. ‘The city is mother to the poor. That is our duty.’

Back at the soup kitchen, volunteers like Dimitria Kollia, dole out the food. ‘We’re seeing them younger and younger,’ she says. ‘And also professional couples who’ve lost their jobs. In three months the queue has changed, and that is very frightening for our future.’
