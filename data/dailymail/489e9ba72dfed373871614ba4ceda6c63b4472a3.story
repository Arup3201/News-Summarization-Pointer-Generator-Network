She made headlines for flogging a £600 shot glass and £2,917 sterling silver decanters on her website earlier this year.

And now Gwyneth Paltrow has embarked on another glamorous collaboration - this time a golden wetsuit by Cynthia Rowley worth £200 ($295).

As if forking out for a diving holiday isn't indulgent enough, you can now kit yourself out in the luxury deep-water gear available exclusively through Gwyneth's lifestyle website, Goop.

Totally rad: In Gwyneth's world, we would all wear gold when out on a casual dive

'We're obsessed with this super rad wetsuit from Cynthia Rowley,' goes the description on the actress' site.

The diving suit, sold exclusively on Goop is said to have a make for a 'form-fitting look' and is 'functionally constructed from metallic gold neoprene that shines in the summer sun'.

Gwyneth, who makes a number of glamorous, sometimes rariefied items available to her Goop readers, collaborated on sterling silver crockery earlier this year.

Describing a £616 ($950) shot glass, she 
wrote: 'This sterling shot cup has the phrase "Just a thimble full" 
engraved on it - a gentle reminder to practice a little bit of 
restraint.

'A great gift or a fun conversation piece for your home bar.'

Gwynnie does, however, stress that she is completely normal - just like the rest of us.

The actress is selling gold wetsuits, just months after making headlines with super-luxury silver crockery

Earlier this year, she confessed: ‘One of my most negative 
qualities is... perfectionism... it comes from self-doubt and 
insecurity.

'I’m just a normal mother with the same struggles as any
other... trying to do everything at once, trying to be a wife and 
maintain a relationship.’

Long shot: Her shot glasses at £616 ($950), and she describes them as 'a great gift or a fun conversation piece'

She also says she has developed thick skin to face critics.

In
an interview with the March 2011 issue of Harper's Bazaar UK, she 
admitted: 'There were a couple of times when I thought 'I'm just gonna 
stop doing it.

'People are so mean to me. I don't want to do it.

'But
then I was like, "Who cares what some lame person out there says?" I 
was in Italy once, and this old man came up to me and said, "I had the 
best time in Nashville because of Goop." And that is so worth it to me.'

Expensive drinking habits: Gwyneth is also selling a pair of glass and sterling silver decanters for a cool £2917

Shaken or stirred: Golf club stirrers are on offer for £321 as well as an art deco cocktail shaker for £616

More money than sense: Gwyneth Paltrow's Spring wardrobe tips totted up to an eye-watering figure of £300k

She has previously written about a 21-day Goop cleanse as well as given readers tips on  how to update their spring wardrobe, but her outfit recommendations added up to over £300,000.

The actress launched Goop back in September 2008, a personal website where she dishes 
out advice to her readers and encourages them to 'nourish the inner 
aspect'.

Each week the newsletter focuses on a subject area, split into Make, Go, Get, Do, Be, and See.

Elsewhere on Goop, as spotted last week, is a bangle that doubles as a hip flask.

The hip accessory was being snatched up by fashionistas and celebrities alike, with Gwyneth
Paltrow the latest to model the unique accessory.

A description of the silver chrome Cynthia Rowley bracelet, which costs $225, simply reads: 'Necessity is the mother of invention. . .'

Though the bangle was released in November, Gwyneth Paltrow posted a snap of herself modeling it on some weeks ago on Goop, causing a flurry of readers to hanker after it.

Fashion meets function: On Friday, Gwyneth Paltrow shared a photo of herself wearing a $225 Cynthia Rowley silver chrome Flask Bangle (pictured), with the caption: 'Who doesn't need a covert flask?'

In the caption below the photo of her braceleted arm, the 40-year-old actress wrote: 'Who doesn't need a covert flask?'

The stylishly chunky bangle comes with a screw top, which is attached to the bracelet with a tiny chain.

Fans took to Twitter to share their 
fondness for the accessory. 'No, I don't have a drinking problem,' wrote
one Twitter user. 'But yes, I want this Cynthia Rowley flask bracelet.'
