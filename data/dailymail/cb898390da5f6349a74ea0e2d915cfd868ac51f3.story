A husband and wife who are both lawyers have been charged with two brutal stabbings that occurred on Sunday.

Andrew and Alecia Schmuhl are accused of driving to the home of her 61-year-old boss in the wealthy suburb of McLean, Virginia, and stabbing him and his wife, also 61. 

This after Alecia was fired from her job as a corporate attorney at a nearby Arlington law firm, Bean, Kinney & Korman, where her boss Leo Fisher was a managing partner.

Alecia's boss Leo Fisher (pictured) and his wife Susan have been identified as the victims

It is alleged that Andrew knocked on the door of the $1 million home and began stabbing Mr Fisher, when he answered.

Then, when Mr Fisher's wife Susan, a lawyer herself, heard a commotion and came over to see what was happening, he stabbed her as well.

Mrs Fisher was able to set off an alarm luckily, which sent the couple running.

Emergency responders who arrived at the home on the 900 block of Spencer Rd found the Fishers suffering from stab wounds to their upper body, and the couple was rushed to Inova Fairfax Hospital. 

The couple were last reported still hospitalized, according to the Fairfax Times. 

It is believed that Alecia then drove the two away, and an hour later police found them in their car near Interstate 95.

They have both been charged with two counts each of abduction and malicious wounding in connection with the attack, and are being held without bail. 

Little else is known at this time though as the two victims are still fighting for their lives in a nearby hospital and have been unable to speak with authorities.

Now, police are trying to figure out what motivated this young couple to commit such a heinous crime.

Even former coworkers and friends of the two seem completely baffled. 

'It’s a horrendously sad situation,' Merrit Green, a lawyer who worked with Alecia at a previous job, told The Washington Post.

'She was on a good, bright career path, and so was her husband. It’s just unbelievable.' 

Scene of the crime: The home of the Leo and Susan Fisher in McLean, Virginia

On the case: Police can be seen entering the home to gather evidence

Alecia, 30, spoke three languages and served on the board of a local homeless charity.

A fellow board member said he was 'completely shocked' by the arrest. 

The couple met when they attended Indiana’s Valparaiso University Law School, and Andrew, 31, had held various legal positions over the past few years, though it seemed he was currently unemployed according to his Linked In page. 

They are set to make their first court appearance on January 6.
