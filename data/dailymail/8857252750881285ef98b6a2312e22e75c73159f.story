Argentina forward Angel Di Maria looks set to miss out on the rest of Argentina's World Cup campaign after he suffered a thigh injury in the 1-0 win over Belgium in Brasilia.

Di Maria will undergo a scan after he hobbled out of the quarter-final tie in the 33rd-minute - with media in South America reporting his World Cup is over.

Argentina reached their first semi-final since 1990 but Di Maria looks unlikely to take part in it.

'Angel has a problem in front of his right thigh and he is going to do an analysis tomorrow,' he said.

Argentina will face Holland in the last four of the World Cup for a place in the final.
