Your family's weekend trip to see The Great Gatsby, with all of it's depictions of boozy flapper parties, might be more costly than the already pricey tickets.

A new study published this week in JAMA Pediatrics found that exposure to alcohol in PG-13 and lower films is on the rise, and it may lead to a rise in underage drinking.

The study tracked appearances of both cigarettes and alcohol on TV and in the movies and found some surprising results.

Down with tobacco: A graph from the study shows that instances of smoking in movies hit a high in 1999, and them completely plummeted by 2006 since tobacco companies were banned from product placement

In 1998, the state attorney generals signed the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) which banned tobacco brands from paying for product placement on TV and in films. 

What happened next was extraordinary.

The Dartmouth study tracked the top 100 grossing movies each year and found that tobacco brand appearances went from an all time high of near 100 in 1999 to the rock bottom of about 20 in 2006.

From there it plateaued, reflecting a changed American view on tobacco use.

TV vices: The characters on Mad Men are known for their indulgent boozing and smoking, but overall tobacco depictions on TV and in movies has decreased dramatically since 1999

But the study also focused on alcohol depictions, and in that department found quite a different story.

Because there never was a MSA-equivalent agreement on alcohol product placement in the media (and likely won't be due to First Amendment challenges), overall depictions of alcohol have stayed the same.

What is most troubling though is the number of appearances in youth-rated films.

For films rated PG-13 and lower, alcohol appearances are actually on the rise.

Starting young: Heavy drinking portrayed in PG-13 movies such as The Great Gatsby is the most troubling aspect of the study, since there is a correlation between adolescents seeing alcohol in the media and wanting to drink in real life

This isn't good news, since several studies suggest that, like cigarettes, there is a link between media portrayals of drinking and adolescents subsequently drinking.

A rise in underage drinking could mean more drinking-related accidents and even deaths.

When states took a hard line on tobacco advertising with the MSA, it correlated with U.S. teen smoking hitting a record low last year. Adult smoking is also on a steady decline.

The authors of the study however, don't believe a similar agreement will happen with alcohol companies. Instead, they advocate self-regulation.
