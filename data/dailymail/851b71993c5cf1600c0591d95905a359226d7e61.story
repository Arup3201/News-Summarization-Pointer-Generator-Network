Self-proclaimed Sept. 11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Mohammed claims the former Osama bin Laden spokesperson on trial had nothing to do with the 9/11 terror attacks.

Mohammed claimed in a court filing Sunday that Sulaiman Abu Ghaith was al Qaida's talking head because he was 'an eloquent, spellbinding speaker,' and nothing more.

Abu Gaith, a bin Laden son-in-law, is on trial in a Manhattan federal court for conspiring to kill Americans.

Former spokesperson: Abu Ghaith is charged with conspiring to kill Americans in his role as al-Qaida's flack after 9/11

'[Abu Gaith] was not a military man and had nothing to do with military operations,' Mohammed explained.

Prosecutors claim his role as spokesperson in training videos and in motivating al-Qaida foot soldiers was just as important as any other cog in the terror machine.

The Kuwait-born imam's lawyers agree he made inflammatory remarks but insist he did not conspire to carry out terrorism.

'Those tasked with giving statements to the media do not necessarily know all the details of an operation and are sometimes even unaware of the very existence of the operation,' said Mohammed.

Submission of remarks made in Mohammed's court filing would need approval from the judge overseeing the case. it would not be the first time his words were used in court.

Mohammed was previously permitted to answer written questions after saying the government was too restrictive in its demands for an in-person interview during his former comrade's court proceedings.

He is currently being held at the U.S. detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

His statements have been used twice in the past in terrorism trials. One defendant was released from Guantanamo Bay and the other defendant avoided the death penalty.  

The former terrorist was captured in Pakistan in 
2003, was interrogated, and then was sent to Guantanamo Bay in 2007. 
Mohammed and four other Al Qaida operatives face a military trial that 
could lead to his execution.

Abu Gaith was arrested last March after he sneaked from Afghanistan to Iran. He has become known as Bin Laden's main propagandist and warned the United States that more attacks would occur after both the World Trade center and Pentagon were attacked.

He faces life in prison for representing the terrorist organization responsible for the attacks on Sept. 11.The Abu Gaith case will most likely be the only time that a trial related to the Sept. 11 attacks will take place in New York where the attacks occurred.

The Justice Department originally intended to try Mohammed in the same federal courthouse but after victims and politicians complained, prosecutors surrendered his case to a military tribunal.
