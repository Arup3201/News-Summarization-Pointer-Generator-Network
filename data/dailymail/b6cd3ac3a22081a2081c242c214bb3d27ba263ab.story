Four experienced sailors are presumed dead after their ‘window of survivability’ closed following freak waves that hit their yacht during a prestigious race off the coast of San Francisco on Saturday.

Three of the eight people on board survived the 12-foot waves that struck the side of their yacht, and five were swept out to sea. The body of Mac Kasanin, 46, was found in the water by rescuers, leaving the four remaining crew members unaccounted for.

Alan Cahill, 36, Elmer Morrissey, 32, Alexis Busch, in her mid-20s, and Jordan Fromm, 25, are lost at sea and presumed dead.

Disaster: The 28-foot boat is seen here, surrounded by seals, after crashing into the Farallon Islands in the San Francisco Bay following freak waves during a race on Saturday

The expert sailors were participating in the Full Crew Farallones Race, which has been held since 1907 without incident, circles out from San Francisco Bay out to the barren islands before returning back to port.

This crew were aboard a 38-foot Low Speed Chase when they were struck by unexpected 12-foot waves and pushed off board.

The owner of the boat, James Bradford, was one of the three survivors and he reportedly turned the boat immediately around to go after the crew who had been pushed overboard. When he did that, the Low Speed Chase was then hit by a second massive wave that crashed it into the rocks off the Farallon Islands.

The other two survivors were Nick Vos, who was the longterm boyfriend of the female victim, and Bryan Chong.

A search began for the four missing but now it is feared they may never be found after the U.S Coastguard called off the search indefinitely, saying that the viable search time had passed.

Lieutenant Chris Hanzlik of the  U.S. 
Coastguard said: ‘The operation continued for 30 hours covering an area 
of 5,000 square miles.’

Morrissey (right) both moved from Ireland to America and were two of the
five fatalities in Saturday's boat race

Found
dead: Marc Kasanin, 46, was the only victim whose body was found by 
rescuers. When he wasn’t busy sailing or painting nautical scenes, he 
would help his mother who lived within walking distance

Coastguard and California Air National Guard helicopters lifted off after receiving an emergency alert from a satellite beacon on the Low Speed Chase, as well as a mayday radio call from a nearby yacht.

The female victim, Alexis Busch, was born in San Francisco and was an a part of the close-knit sailing community. On her Facebook profile, she had pictures of she and her boyfriend, Mr  Vos, at a 2010 race in Sydney, Australia. The couple had been dating for 10 years since meeting in high school.

Ms Busch was the daughter of former San Francisco Giants executive vice president Corey Busch and she became involved in the game as Major League Baseball’s first bat girl, carrying bats around for the team.

‘I’ve never experienced anything like this, and I don't ever wish anyone to experience what we're going through,’ Mr Busch told The San Francisco Chronicle.

Rescue: Coast Guard and National Guard helicopters and water craft rescued three crew members who were clinging to rocks

Saved: The rescued crew members had life vests on and cold weather gear - equipment that gave rescuers hope in the search for the missing

‘I can't even describe what the heartache is. You're not supposed to lose a child, and Alex was an incredible person. She was a very special person. It's hard to imagine life without her.’

In a statement, Giants President and CEO Larry Baer said: ‘We were deeply saddened to learn that a member of the Giants Family - Alexis Busch - was one of the victims of this horrible tragedy.

The devastated mother of victim Alan Cahill, originally from Ireland, Nóirín, said her son had moved to the U.S. a decade ago.

Speaking
from her home in Cork, Ireland, she said: ‘We are totally heartbroken. 
Alan loved the U.S. and he loved his sailing. But he kept in touch with 
his family and friends, and loved to come back to Cork whenever he 
could. He has friends all over Ireland, especially in the sailing 
community.

‘Alan married an American girl called Shannon. They have two beautiful children in California.’

Phil
Oakley, who played college hockey with Elmer Morrissey, another 
victim who was also from Ireland, said the sports enthusiast was ‘the 
life and soul of parties’ and a ‘very funny’ writer of sports blogs. 
‘You wouldn’t forget him,’ he added.

Stranded: The boat was washed onto the barren islands and it remains there now

Unexpected: Trouble came when they were struck by two 12-foot waves

He said his friend, who wore the No.13 jersey, had been ‘so unlucky’ with hockey injuries.

Mr
Oakley added: ‘One of our friends is getting married in Italy in August
and he was due to be one of the best men. It was going to be a big 
reunion of all the people in college.’

Mr
Morrissey graduated from University College Cork with a PhD in energy 
engineering in 2004. He then studied in California thanks to a 
scholarship and returned to live there last year.

He had worked in the research and development field in Ireland.

Fr John Paul Hegarty of Glounthaune parish said Mr Morrissey’s parents, Michael and Ena, are dealing with a terrible grief.

Memorial: The team paid a special tribute to the victims at their game on Monday, making particular mention of Ms Busch

He
said: ‘Elmer’s family are abroad and are due home today. He has a 
sister, Kelda. We said special prayers at Mass for Elmer and Alan.

‘He
and Alan would have been accomplished sailors. They were very good 
friends. They were very fine sportsmen who liked the outdoors and were 
very athletic.

The final missing victim, Jordan Fromm, had grown up sailing and his parents were longtime members of the club that manages the annual race.

‘He was just a sweet guy. A lot of times young sailors who are really good can be cocky- but not him. He’d take the time to explain things to you,’ said Kerry Spiller who raced with the Low Speed Chase several times.

Mr Kasanin, whose body was the only one recovered by rescuers, was raised similarly and went on his first sail at age 5.

Tragedy: Women walk together to a vigil at the San Francisco Yacht Club in Belvedere, California for the missing sailors during a race

Upset: The close-knit sailing community in San Francisco is devastated upon hearing the news of a dead sailor, four missing and three rescued

The San Francisco Chronicle reports that when he wasn’t busy sailing or painting nautical scenes, he would help his mother who lived within walking distance with the gardening.

‘I just relied on him for everything, and he was a good friend,’ his mother Anne Kasanin told the paper.

The three survivors escaped with fairly minor injuries, the worst being a broken leg.

Ed Lynch, director of the yacht club, said the accident was ‘a tragedy of unbelievable proportions’.

He said that Mr Cahill was a ‘close personal friend and neighbour’ who was ‘a very experienced sailor who had done a lot of open ocean racing’.

He added: ‘Alan was a terrific guy, who had the Irish wit. Around the yacht club he was named Irish Alan.’

The club, founded in 1869, held a private candlelit vigil on Sunday. This tragedy was the first fatal accident in its history.

The Full Crew Farallones Race is a century-old tradition that has never been for the faint of heart.

Winds averaging 10 to 20 knots 
(18-37kilometres) and churning 14-foot Pacific Ocean swells are among 
the rough conditions typically braved by yachts and their crews during 
the day-long regatta, a favourite of skilled sailors.

The search: Coast guards stopped looking 30 hours after the accident

The 87kilometre race, organised by the 143-year-old San Francisco Yacht Club, had 49 entrants.

But as the Low Speed Chase cruiser 
with two Irish crewmen aboard rounded the South Farallon Island, two 
strong waves swept them from the boat.

The steep and rocky Farallon Islands 
are visible from San Francisco on a clear day and uninhabited except for
a manned research station.

Part of a national wildlife refuge and
closed to the public, they are home to vast quantities of birds and are
surrounded by waters rich with seals and sea lions, and sharks that 
feed on them.

Low Speed Chase remains grounded but intact.

R David Britt, a chemist who skippered
his sailboat, Split Water, in the race for the third time said the 
sailing on Saturday was ‘pretty intense’.

He added: ‘The worst thing is to have a
wave break on you. You can go up and down, up and down, but if a wave 
breaks on the cockpit on top of the crew, that’s how somebody could get 
swept out of the boat.’
