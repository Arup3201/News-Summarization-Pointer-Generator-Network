Wanting answers: Jack Straw has demanded Met Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe explains the 'Plebgate' delays

Jack Straw last night joined growing criticism of the police inquiry into claims that serving officers conspired to bring down former Tory Cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell.

The former Labour Home Secretary called on ministers to demand answers from Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe over the ‘inordinate and unjustified’ delays in the Plebgate case.

Mr Straw, a personal friend of Mr Mitchell, last night wrote to Home Secretary Theresa May urging her to take action in the case, in which Mr Mitchell admitted swearing at Downing Street police but denied calling them ‘plebs’.

‘No one, whatever their position, should have to suffer the toll which all this has taken on Andrew and his family. It’s high time these delays were brought to an end,’ he wrote.

Scotland Yard has signallet  that its inquiry into the Plebgate affair could drag on into 2014 after it was handed new information.

It revealed detectives are examining ‘three separate pieces of evidence’ passed to the force by the police watchdog and a ‘third party’.

Their appearance led to senior prosecutors handing back the case file on the explosive 45 second Downing Street clash.

Last night, a spokesman said ‘further inquiries’ are being made and said the complicated investigation will take ‘as long as is necessary’.

The comments came shortly before the one year anniversary of the confrontation between the then Government Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell and police guards.

Police stopped Mr Mitchell as he tried to cycle through the main Downing Street gates and angry words were exchanged on September 19 last year.

The MP admitted swearing but denied using the word ‘pleb’, something officers recorded in an email version of events. He resigned the next month.

But what began as a probe into who said what and when has grown amid claims that the senior politician was ‘stitched up’.

Mr Mitchell and a close circle of supporters believe he was the victim of a deliberate and co-ordinated attempt to smear the Tory party and ruin his career.

This week marks a year since Andrew Mitchell allegedly called police guarding the gates of Downing Street 'plebs'

In December, CCTV footage cast doubt on the police version of events and a supposedly independent witness was apparently exposed as a fraud.

The information forced the Met to reopen its inquiry as officers said they would interview all 800 members of the diplomatic protection group.

Since then Met Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has given a limited apology to the Mr Mitchell, saying he was sorry if his confidence in the inquiry has been damaged.

The top police officer is accused of undermining the judicial process by effectively exonerating the officers guarding Downing Street.

In the weeks after the incident he said he had no reason not to believe what they said happened took place.

Overall, eight people, including five police officers, have been arrested for offences including misconduct in a public office and leaking information as part of Operation Alice.

A separate inquiry, by West Mercia 
Police, is examining the conduct of Police Federation representatives 
who held a meeting with Mr Mitchell.

Both
inquiries are being overseen by the Independent Police Complaints 
Commission (IPCC), which passed on some of the new evidence.

Scotland Yard has endured repeated criticism of the slow pace of its inquiry, which has left both the officers involved and Mr Mitchell in limbo.

The Met spokesman said: ‘Operation Alice has been ongoing since it was re-opened in December 2012 following fresh information.

‘This investigation is examining very serious allegations, that go to the heart of the public’s trust in the police service.

‘The Met is conducting a thorough investigation that aims to establish the truth of what has taken place and find the best possible evidence.

‘An initial file was passed to the CPS in March 2013, however since that time three separate pieces of information have been given to us.

‘As a result further inquiries have had to be made.

‘The investigation is being conducted with oversight from the IPCC. This complicated inquiry will go where the evidence takes us, and will take as long as is necessary.

‘As this is an ongoing investigation we cannot provide details at this stage, however we can confirm that three separate pieces of information have been provided to police via the IPCC and a third party.’

Operation Alice, which has involved a team of more than 30 detectives, is believed to have cost more than £250,000.
