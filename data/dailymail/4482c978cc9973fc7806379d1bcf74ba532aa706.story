French fatties: The French's love of junk food has seen obesity figures soar

A diet of junk food and a couch-potato lifestyle is turning the traditionally skinny French into a nation of fatties, health experts have warned.

Almost seven million people in France are now classified clinically obese - nearly double the figure of 15 years ago - the latest study has revealed.

Despite still being officially Europe's second thinnest people, the weight of the average French person has soared by just over half a stone to 11 stone 6lbs since 1997, the report found.

The biggest weight gains were among 18 to 24-year-olds, who are becoming 'addicted to fast food', according to the government sponsored survey by pharmacists Obepi-Roche.

Poorer people in the industrial areas of northern and eastern France were also twice as likely to be overweight as better off families in Paris, Brittany and the French Riviera, the study showed.

France's food minister has now called for traffic light-style warning labels on all food labels to warn of high sugar, salt or fat content.

Guillaume Garot also blamed food manufacturers of not 'playing the game' by presenting high calorie foods as healthy products.

He said: 'These days you virtually need a degree in chemistry to understand the nutritional information on food labels.

'We need a simpler system that simply says in three colours if a food will make you fat, if its neutral or if its healthy.

'This a a health problem that affects the whole of our society and the government will tackle it as a matter of priority.'

Europe's fattest nation is Greece, where 70 per cent of people are overweight, and 30 per cent are obese.

Britain has the second fattest women in Europe, where 62 per cent are overweight and 22 per cent are obese.

British men are Europe's fifth fattest, behind Germany, Greece, Finland and Ireland. 62 per cent of UK males are overweight and 20 per cent are obese, according a TNS Sofres survey of 500,000 people across the EU in 2007.

The world's fattest country is Tonga, where 70 per cent of women and 48 per cent of men are obese.

The NHS defines being overweight as having a body mass index - your weight to height ratio - of between 25 and 30, and obese as over 30.
