A psychiatrist broke the rules of patient confidentiality to expose one of her patients as a dangerous paedophile to police.

Dr Ruth Bagshaw feared Gareth Jordan, 55, would kidnap or attack a child after he confessed his sexual urges to her during medical treatment.

A court heard the doctor decided her duty 'over-rode' the strict medical rules of patient confidentiality - and contacted police to warn them about her patient's fantasies.

The doctor felt that her duty over-rode patient confidentiality, Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard

Police raided Jordan's home and found photographs he had taken of children walking to a nearby primary school.

They also discovered children's clothing and underwear Jordan had bought to 'replicate' his fantasies.

Prosecutor Nicola Harris said: 'Dr Ruth Bagshaw approached police with concerns over Jordan.

'He had been to see her and she was extremely concerned by what he had told her.

'Her duties under the Children Act overrode patient confidentiality.'

Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard Jordan was already on the sex offenders register after admitting 26 charges relating to indecent images of children.

Police had found 844 static images between levels one and three and 62 movie files between levels one and four.

He was ordered to sign as a sex offender for five years and made the subject of an indefinite Sexual Offences Prevention Order.

Jordan was also prohibited from buying female underwear.

Miss Harris said: 'There were also 46 pictures of children walking to school in Cardiff which Jordan had taken with his own camera.

'There was also a DVD of a beauty pageant at a nudist or naturist camp focusing on naked female participants.'

Jordan, of Tylorstown, Rhondda, admitted three counts of possessing indecent images of children, one of making indecent images of children, and breaching the Sexual Offences Prevention Order.

Judge Richard Twomlow made Jordan the subject of a community order to run alongside the existing order, which expires in June 2016.

He was also ordered to complete 100 hours of unpaid work and pay a £60 victim surcharge.

Judge Twomlow told him: 'The breach was flagrant and deliberate. Any further breach will result in imprisonment.'

The General Medical Council advises that it is incredibly important to offer a confidential medical service - but says that must be balanced with the public's interest.

Their guidance states: 'Confidential medical care is recognised in law as being in the public interest.

'However, there can also be a public interest in disclosing information: to protect individuals or society from risks of serious harm, such as serious communicable diseases or serious crime; or to enable medical research, education or other secondary uses of information that will benefit society over time.

'Personal information may, therefore, be disclosed in the public interest, without patients’ consent, and in exceptional cases where patients have withheld consent, if the benefits to an individual or to society of the disclosure outweigh both the public and the patient’s interest in keeping the information confidential.'
