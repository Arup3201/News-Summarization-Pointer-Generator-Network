A key Democratic lawmaker threatened congressional hearings on Tuesday over the Obama administration's lack of action to confront ISIS, the Islamist terror group responsible for beheading two American journalists and distributing the gory videos.

New York Rep. Eliot Engel, the House Foreign Affairs Committee's ranking Democrat, said during a conference call with reporters that he and Republican committee chair Rep. Ed Royce plan to call hearings this month to oversee the president's airstrike campaign against the Islamist group in Iraq and bring some focus to the White House's strategic thinking.

'The threat of ISIS is just something that I believe very strongly that we cannot take lightly,' Engel said of the terrorist self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham.

'We cannot dither, we cannot just twiddle our thumbs, or wait and see,' he insisted. 'We have to act and we have to act soon. The more countries that we can get in this crusade to destroy terrorism ... the better it will be.'

Vice President Joe Biden followed on Wednesday with war drums in Portsmouth, New 
Hampshire, saying the U.S. would follow ISIS 'to the gates of hell.'

'When people harm Americans, we don’t retreat,' he blared during an appearance at a naval shipyard. 'We don’t forget.'

'We take care of those who are grieving, and when that’s finished, they should know, we will follow them to the gates of hell until they are brought to justice. Because hell is where they will reside! Hell is where they will reside!'

Steven 
Sotloff, a Florida freelancer for Time and Foreign Policy magazines, was
 shown in the terrorists' footage following a message blaming Obama's 
continuing airstrikes for his fate.

Sotloff
 and James Foley, a U.S. photojournalist executed in a similar fashion 
on a video released in August, were believed to be held in Syria, where a
 growing ISIS army maintains control over much of the nation's eastern 
territories.

Under the War Powers Resolution of 1973, the White House can't send the U.S. military into armed conflict for more than 60 days without congressional authorization.

That clock will run out on October 7. President Obama said Wednesday in Estonia that fighting ISIS 'is not going to be a one-week or one-month or six-month proposition.'

Royce and Engel, the Daily Beast reported, said that in the wake of a second gruesome video showing the beheading of an American journalist, they're determined to make sure the administration is proceeding in a way that Congress approves of.

Virginia Republican Rep. Frank Wolf went one step further on Wednesday, unveiling a bill that he will soon introduce to authorize ongoing military force against ISIS and other Islamist terror groups.

The proposed legislation would permit Obama 'to use all necessary and appropriate force against those countries, organizations, or persons associated with or supporting terrorist groups, including al-Qaeda and its regional affiliates, the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, al Shabaab, Boko Haram, and any other emerging regional terrorist groups that share a common violent extremist ideology.'

His goal, articulated in the bill, is 'to eliminate all such terrorist groups.'

A separate bill drafted by Florida Sen. Bill Nelson would give President Obama the legal authority to carry out airstrikes on ISIS in Syria.

'Let there be no doubt, we must go after ISIS right away because the U.S. is the only one that can put together a coalition to stop this group that’s intent on barbaric cruelty,' the Democratic lawmaker said in a statement.

Both Wolf and Nelson intend to file their legislation next week when Congress reconvenes after a month-long recess.

Wolf
 said Wednesday that 'for far too long the Obama Administration and the 
Congress have been debating whether or not authority exists for action 
to address this threat.'

'We cannot continue operating on outdated authorities passed 13 years ago; it is time for this Congress to vote,' he said.

Wolf's
 bill includes a sop to dovish Democrats in the form of a requirement 
that the president must act with 'the close consultation, coordination, 
and cooperation with NATO and regional allies.'

At the 
heart of lawmakers' concerns is the thorny question of whether Obama 
will authorize airstrikes against ISIS in Syria as well as Iraq. 

'We
 anticipate there will be a vote on authorization of the use of force 
for such a plan,' Royce said Tuesday. 'That would come within the 60-day
 window.'

Engel
 agreed. 'We believe that before the president can continue beyond 60 
days of doing airstrikes in Iraq or anyplace else, he would have to come
 to Congress and get Congress’s authority to continue,' he said.

The president admitted last Thursday that 'we don't have a strategy yet' for that

The confession elicited gasps from lawmakers from the president's own political party.

Minnesota Sen. Al Franken said on Tuesday in a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder that he was 'troubled' by Obama's admission.

In a statement released Tuesday Virgina Sen. Mark Warner called on the president to present Congress 'with a clear strategy and political and military options for eliminating the ISIL threat.'

'The United States should not take any military options off the table, because stopping ISIL is in the national security and foreign policy interests of the U.S. and our European allies,' Warner's statement read.

Obama has unequivocally said the U.S. will not put combat boots on the ground in Iraq to fight Islamic extremists.

On Wednesday in Estonia, after nearly a week-long media feeding frenzy that delivered one PR black eye after another, the president tried to clarify what he meant by his no strategy remark.

'I was specifically referring to the possibility of the military strategy inside of Syria that might require congressional approval,' he said during a press conference.

'It is very important from my perspective that when we send our pilots in to do a job, that we know that this is a mission that's going to work, that we're very clear on what our objectives are, what our targets are; we've made the case to Congress and we've made the case to the American people; and we've got allies behind us so that it's not just a one-off, but it's something that over time is going to be effective.'

Royce
 also told reporters on Tuesday that he and Engel plan on 'scheduling a 
hearing upon our return and requesting the secretary of state to present
 a plan, a strategy focused on rolling back ISIS, defeating ISIS through
 the use of airstrikes and the support of those with common interests.'

Georgia GOP Sen. Saxby Chambliss, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, joined the impatience caucus on Wednesday by insisting that 'the United States must destroy ISI[S] now.'

'The West cannot continue to stand by while this group continues to kill innocent persons, as it has already done with the appalling murders of James Foley and Steven Sotloff,' he said. 'The time to stop and destroy ISIL is now.'

Secretary
 of State John Kerry took nearly 24 hours to comment on Sotloff's death,
 saying in a statement Wednesday morning that it was 'an act of medieval
 savagery by a coward hiding behind a mask.'

His
 emailed statement came shortly before he presided over a ceremony to 
honor Shaarik Zafar, his special envoy to U.S. Muslim communities.

'For
 so many who worked so long to bring Steven and the other Americans home
 safely, this was not how the story should've ended,' Kerry said. 'Its a
 punch to the gut.

'[T]hose
 who have murdered James Foley and Steven Sotloff in Syria,' he vowed, 
'should know that the United States will hold them accountable too, no 
matter how long it takes.'

But Royce, the more hawkish of the two congressmen who spoke to reporters Tuesday, stopped short of calling for massive bombing campaigns trailing through Syrian airspace.

That could indicate that Kerry and other Obama administration officials will have a hard time justifying additional airstrikes without also arming anti-ISIS groups on the ground.

The White House needs to 'accelerate this process,' Royce said, suggesting that the U.S. should be arming the moderate Free Syrian Army to fight ISIS.

He also criticized the administration for its plodding approach to arming the Kurdish Peshmerga army in northern Iraq.

Obama said Wednesday that the primary U.S. objective 'is to degrade and destroy' ISIS 'so that it’s no longer a threat not just to Iraq but also the region and to the United States.'

But in the same press conference, he said a successful American effort in the region would 'shrink' the group's 'sphere of influence, its effectiveness, its financing, its military capabilities to the point where it is a manageable problem.'
