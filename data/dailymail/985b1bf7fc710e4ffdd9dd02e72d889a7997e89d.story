Reality TV show The Block has been accused of 'faking' an environmental scare, further damaging the show's reputation.

During the most recent series viewers were told the safety of the Glasshouse building at the Melbourne site was compromised by a mysterious underground tank, which held thousands of litres of fuel.

Concerned builders, worried that the fuel may have leaked into the surrounding soil, then received a visit from an Environmental Protection Authority representative. Or so viewers were led to believe.

The Daily Telegraph claims the EPA inspector introduced as 'Chris'(pictured), was actually an environmental scientist hired by the show

The show says it was a case of 'misidentification' and an 'editing error'

The Daily Telegraph claims the EPA inspector introduced as 'Chris', seen taking soil samples, was actually an environmental scientist hired by the show.

The Block spokesman Terry Stuart admitted to the Daily Telegraph, it was a case of 'misidentification' and an 'editing error' when 'Chris' was labelled an EPA inspector by host Scott Cam.

'Back on The Block, the rep from the EPA has arrived and the news is not good,' he said on a voiceover during the episode.

'He was in fact an environmental scientist hired by The Block Glasshouse to help us liaise with the EPA,' said Mr Stuart.

The Block cast : the show is being put under the spotlight again after claims of faking a visit from the EPA

But after being contacted by the media, the EPA confirmed they in fact had 'no involvement' with the show regarding the pollution concerns.

This is just one of a few scandals the show has had to deal with following its final episode.

A viewer complaint, following footage of Scott Cam piloting a large remote controlled camera drone, raised more questions.

Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority started investigations into possible safety breaches but Alpha Media, the company contracted to film aerial shots for the show, claimed he wasn't actually flying the drone.
