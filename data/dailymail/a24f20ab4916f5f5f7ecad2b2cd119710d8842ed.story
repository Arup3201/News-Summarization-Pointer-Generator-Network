She will face four charges of adult abuse of a position of trust - sexual activity with a boy between 13 and 17 years.

A spokesman for North Somerset council confirmed a teacher had been suspended from their post while the allegations were investigated.

The spokesman said: 'We can confirm that a member of staff at a North Somerset school has been suspended.

'As the matter is currently the subject of a police investigation, it would be inappropriate to comment any further.'
