David Gandy models the latest Marks & Spencer Collections range in brand new images revealed today.

The Essex-born model, 33, sports his trademark goatee beard and quiffed hair as he wears a selection of the High Street giant's pieces.

David is photographed by Arnaldo Anaya-Lucca for M&S Collection's spring campaign in the exclusive images.

The Collection is an edit of everyday quality pieces created to build the cornerstone of your wardrobe.

As a leading style icon and London Collections: Men ambassador, David embodies its effortless style rather well.

David has so far attended many of the London Collections: Men shows this season, Richard Nicoll, Superdry, and the Mens Health, Liberty and YMC party yesterday.

Looks include stylish classic grey suits and coral coloured casual separates

David and rapper Tinie Tempah were both seated on the front 
row of the Topman catwalkÂ LC:M on Monday - and sported surprisingly similar looks, complete with geek chic glasses and scoop-neck T-shirts.

Wearing
 a blue checked suit over a white T-shirt, David teamed his look with a chunky watch, leather boots, a 
pocket square and a goatee beard.

He has also been spotted attending Lou Dalton and the launch of LC:M on Sunday.

Last
 month, the fashion world's most eligible bachelor was spotted holding 
hands with a mystery woman as they partied in private members' club The 
Groucho.

His last relationship ended in October when we reported David had split from alleged girlfriend of five months, Samantha Barks.

The
 heartthrob was last seen with the 23-year-old during London Fashion 
Week in September before the couple called time on their relationship.

David has also dated model Sarah Ann Macklin and The Saturdays' Mollie King.
