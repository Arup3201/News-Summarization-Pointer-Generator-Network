A convicted murderer who butchered and severed the penis of his housemate tried to avenge the death of his prison mate by attempting to kill a prison guard.

Michael Stephen Owen-Darcy violently attacked four Wacol prison staff inside the Arthur Gorrie Correctional Centre in January last year, the Brisbane Supreme Court was told on Monday.

The 35-year-old killer pleaded guilty to the attempted murder of a prison guard, causing grievous bodily harm to another by biting part off his ear and seriously assaulting a third prison staffer.

The court was told that Owen-Darcy lashed out at prison staff for letting accused double murderer Scott O'Connor, 31, who killed himself in the jail's Maximum Security Unit on January 22, reported The Courier Mail.

The crown prosecutor said Owen-Darcy tried to murder a guard by using a homemade 'shiv' - a razor blade taped between two paddle pop sticks - on January 25.

He repeatedly tried to slice his victim's throat, face and arm.

The crown said during the attack Owen-Darcy was heard yelling: 'I'm going to murder you, you b*****d.'

'This is for my mate (O’Connor) in the MSU. I want to see how long it will take to get (help) to one of your own staff.'

The killer is currently serving life imprisonment after being sentenced in 2010 for slaying his friend and housemate David John Easton, 37, at Brisbane's southwest suburb of Inala in July 2007.

The 35-year-old stabbed his landlord and friend David John Easton 41 times at their home on Andromeda Street, Inala

Owen-Darcy stabbed Easton 41 times with four different knives during the savage attack and then sliced off the dead man's genitals.

His testicles were found in the kitchen sink while his penis was wrapped in cling film and placed inside a salt container, Brisbane Times reported.

In court today, Owen-Darcy faced was surrounded by six prison guards as he wore handcuffs and body restraints.

The court was told that two days after his initial prison attack, he used his 'teeth as weapons' to bite off a large piece of a guard's ear.

'Without a weapon (Owen-Darcy) used his teeth to bite off part of the ear of a prison officer (and assault another),' the crown said.

The court was told that as Owen-Darcy was already serving a term of life imprisonment for Easton's murder he had been entitled to apply for parole in mid-2022.

Justice David Boddice sentenced Owen-Darcy to 17 years for the jailhouse attacks and declared him to be a dangerous violent offender.

Owen-Darcy will have to serve at least 80 per cent of his latest sentence behind bars which means his eligibility parole date has been extended until late 2027.

'This was a cold, calculated and callous act on your behalf,' Justice Boddice said in sentencing Owen-Darcy.

He told the prosecutor that it would now be up to parole authorities to decide whether Owen-Darcy should ever be granted release due to his long history of seriously violent crimes.
