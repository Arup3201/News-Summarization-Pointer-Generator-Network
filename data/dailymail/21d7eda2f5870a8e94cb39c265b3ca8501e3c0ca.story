 

Two Washington, D.C. reporters were able to drive through the outer security gates of a Maryland nuclear power plant without being challenged, according to a report published Tuesday.

The Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant in Lusby, Md., had an unattended and padlocked guard gate when journalists drove through – on two separate occasions.

They easily accessed a parking lot within 550 feet of a working nuclear reactor without prompting any kind of contact with uniformed security.

'No one stopped or even seemed to notice them,' The Daily Caller reported.

Terrorist jackpot: Reporters with the online news website The Daily Caller were able to drive onto the premises of a Maryland nuclear power plant and approach a working reactor without any challenge

Drive-thru: The Calvert Cliffs Nuclear Power Plant, just 50 miles from Washington, DC, has an open front gate

Nuclear plants, including those on bodies of water, like the Calvert Cliffs facility, provide a tantalizing target for terror groups bent on causing mass-casualty events in the United States.

But a previous visitor to the site told the Caller that the nuclear facility 'is the softest target I have ever seen in my life.'

With a camera rolling, the journalists approached the front gate expecting to be challenged. But the guardhouse was padlocked shut and there was no security to be found anywhere.

On their second visit, they saw a lone security vehicle driving around the premises but it drove right past them without any sort of inspection. 

And a large civilian delivery truck, more than amply sized to serve as a giant bomb, also rolled through the gates without anyone stopping it.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commission oversees the safety and security of nuclear power plants via commissioners appointed by the President of the United States.

Diane Screnci, a spokesperson for the agency, told The Daily Caller that 'based on the security inspections we've conducted on an on-going basis, security at Calvert Cliffs is appropriate to protect the public health and safety.' 

It's unclear how often those checks are performed, or if the NRC plans to ramp up its efforts following the embarrassing public report.

But it has cited the plant's 'security deficiencies' before, in 2011, without describing exactly what it found lacking.

In an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Tuesday, more than 7 in 10 Americans said they think it's likely that terrorists with the self-proclaimed Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) are already inside the United States and poised to attack the American homeland.

ISIS has cut a swath of torture, death and destruction through more than half of Iraq and much of eastern Syria. 

Padlocked: The guard shack outside Calvert Cliffs was deserted and locked up

The nuclear power plant is run by the Exelon Corporation, which insists that it's not required to post guards outside its nuclear plants' grounds

The Exelon Corporation operates the Calvert Cliffs plant. Its spokesman Kory Raftery told TheDC that it's 'not required' to maintain manned checkpoints at all of its nuclear plants. 

He claimed Calvert Cliffs and the company's other facilities are 'highly-secure, virtually impenetrable facilities.'

'The fences and checkpoints you see at Calvert Cliffs are only a small part of our defense in depth security strategy,' Raftery told the center-right online outlet. 'In fact, much of our defense lies in the things you can't see.'

He insisted that officers who used to man the front gate had been redeployed in a way that 'enhanced overall site security' and 'increased safety for our officers.'

An expert with the left-leaning Union of Concerned Scientists told the Caller that having a 'visible defense' on the outer perimeter of a nuclear plant can make terrorists think twice about mounting an attack.

The 9/11 Commission report includes frightening descriptions of an al-Qaeda plot, ultimately abandoned, to attack an American nuclear power reactor.

And a pair of University of Texas professors concluded in a 2013 report that the U.S. risks 'deliberate sabotage of nuclear facilities, such as by aircraft attacks, vehicle bombs, anti-tank weapons, or the disabling of pumps by an insider or an intruder facilitated by an insider who disables locks and alarms.'

'Terrorists may commit radiological sabotage to provoke public fear, showcase their ability to inflict societal harm, or potentially induce an energy crisis in areas dependent on power reactors,' wrote the experts.
