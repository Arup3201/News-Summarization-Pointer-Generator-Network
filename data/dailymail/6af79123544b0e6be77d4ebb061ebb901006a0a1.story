Victim: This elderly woman - 'Joan' - was so badly beaten up by a gang of muggers that she was too scared to tell anyone what had happened for five days

An 80-year-old grandmother was beaten up by a gang of muggers after she told them smoking was bad for their health, it was revealed today.

The pensioner, who has been named only as ‘Joan’, was on a shopping trip to buy groceries when she was ambushed by the men and beaten so savagely that she was too frightened to reveal her ordeal for five days.

During the assault in Haughton Green, Greater Manchester, the yobs told her: ‘Don’t talk to us like that’ - then punched her in the face whilst she was on her knees, begging them to stop.

Despite extensive bruising the widow managed to stagger home after the assault, but was so traumatised she refused to step out into the street again - for fear the yobs might be waiting for her outside to give her a second beating.

The alarm was only raised when she was paid a visit by her daughter Karen Priestley, 44, who was left shocked at the bruising on her face.

She posted a picture of the pensioner’s injuries on Facebook in an appeal for help in catching the culprits - and this was spotted by police.

Today, detectives investigating the attack issued the image of the woman’s injuries in the hope it might shame the yobs into turning themselves in.

Mrs Priestley said: ‘My mum is very muddled and frightened now. She didn’t want anybody to know about what happened but and now the whole world knows.

Shock: The alarm was only raised when Joan was paid a visit by her 44-year-old daughter Karen Priestley

‘She is embarrassed and frightened and she doesn’t need it. If I could speak to her attackers I would say hand yourself in - you need some help. If someone did that to your mother or grandmother you wouldn’t like it.

‘I have had plenty of offers to have these lads sorted out - but if I did anything like that I would be just as bad as them. Sadly it’s going to take a long time for my mum to feel safe in her own house.

‘She’s usually very independent and he won’t even stay at my house. She is a strong lady. She’s been on her own since dad died 28 years ago. Somebody must know who has done it.

‘I feel numb and it’s making me ill thinking about it. I just want to get the word out that these people are around and they need catching and stopping. They could have killed my mother.’

Joan, a retired hotel kitchen worker, was attacked at the start of the New Year after she had gone shopping at Tesco on Mancunian Way in Haughton Green.

As she walked down this road she was approached by the four men, one of whom asked her for a cigarette. The pensioner said she did not have any - but the gang asked her for money.

They then rifled through the victim’s pockets before punching her a ‘number of times’ to her head, knocking her to her knees.

While on her knees they continued to 
punch her before running off onto the playing fields at the rear of 
Mancunian Road. Nothing was stolen.

Scene: The unnamed victim, 79, was attacked as she walked home from a shopping trip to Tesco in Haughton Green (pictured), Manchester. She was cornered by the thugs, before being repeatedly punched in the face

Joan
 told police she believed the mugging occurred at around 11am in the 
first few days of 2014, but she cannot narrow-it down any further due to
 the time that has elapsed.

Mrs
 Priestley added: ‘We should have been going out on New Year’s Day for 
something to eat but I wasn’t well. I phoned my mum up and said I 
couldn’t go and then a few days later I went round to take her some 
shopping.

‘When I went in 
she had dark glasses and she eventually took them off and said she had 
been mugged. Her two eyes were black and I nearly died with shock. I was
 horrified.

‘For an 
80-year-old woman to be attacked by four lads - it’s disgusting. It’s 
her birthday next month and now she doesn’t even want to celebrate it. 
She didn’t tell anybody about the attack.

'I have had plenty of offers to have these lads sorted out - but if I did anything like that I would be just as bad as them'

Karen Priestley, daughter

‘She
 wouldn’t even tell me. She was hoping the bruises would go. She said 
she had been up to the shop and these four lads asked for a cigarette 
and she said she didn’t smoke and they shouldn’t smoke either “because 
it’s not good for you”.

‘They
 said “don’t talk to us like that” and they hit her. Two of them hit her
 and she fell to her knees and they ran off. A lady was speaking to her 
after the attack and she said “watch they don’t see where you live”.

‘She
 was terrified after that that they would come back and she hasn’t been 
out at all. The bad thing is if they have done it already - they will 
probably do it again.

‘My 
11-year-old daughter was in tears when she saw her gran. It was just 
horrendous. These youth must have some sort of a conscience. They need 
to hand themselves in.’

Detective
 Inspector Richard Ennis, from Greater Manchester Police said: ‘This 
poor victim was so distraught by what happened that she essentially shut
 herself away from the world, fearing that these horrible muggers would 
find her.

‘Thankfully her 
daughter paid her a visit and was at least able to offer some solace of 
comfort. I understand why she didn’t want to tell anyone about what 
happened and she must have felt extremely vulnerable.

Discovery:: Police only found out about her ordeal five days later when the pensioner was visited by her daughter, who was shocked by her severe bruising. Above, Mancunian Road, where the attack took place

‘I
 would, however, always encourage anyone who has been a victim of crime 
to call the police. We have ways of protecting your identity and can 
provide professional support to victims and witnesses.’

He
 added: ‘These young men ruthlessly beat a lone elderly woman. Two of 
them appear to be quite young, but they were clearly led by two older 
men.

‘I also want to appeal 
direct to both the offenders and their families - please look at the 
picture and imagine it’s your own grandma or mum. You wouldn’t want your
 loved ones to end up like this.’

'This poor victim was so distraught by what happened that she essentially shut herself away from the world, fearing that these horrible muggers would find her'

Detective Inspector Richard Ennis, Greater Manchester Police

‘If you feel uneasy by what happened then please call the police, anonymously if necessary.’

‘Horrific
 unprovoked attacks like this are rare in Haughton Green and I want to 
reassure residents that we are doing all we can to bring the offenders 
to justice.

‘I also want to 
praise the officers for their dogged determination to trace the victim. 
Thanks to their hard work we are now able to reassure her that we are 
doing everything in our power to catch the offenders.’

The
 ringleader of the gang was mixed race, 5ft 11in tall and in his mid-20s
 with short black cropped hair and a slim build. He was wearing reddish 
gloves similar to rubber kitchen gloves, mud-splattered jeans and a 
coat.

A second mugger was 
described as white, pale and ‘thuggish-looking’. He was shorter, 
appeared to be in his late teens more muscular build and was also 
wearing green rubber gloves.

The other two offenders were also white, in their early teens and were described as looking similar in the face.
