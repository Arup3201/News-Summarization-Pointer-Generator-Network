Although the couple’s baby boy is third in line to the throne, he will have a rather rootless existence for the first few months of his life.

The Duke and Duchess will, initially, bring their newborn back to Nottingham Cottage, the two-bedroom pied-a-terre in the grounds of Kensington Palace they have lived in for the past two years.

Although it has its own small walled garden, the cottage can best be described as cosy and it will only be a temporary arrangement.

Excitement: Plans are already in place for when the Duchess of Cambridge and her baby boy are allowed to go home

Coming home: Kensington Palace, pictured on Thursday, is in the middle of a refurbishment programme and is covered with scaffolding

For as soon as William returns to work following his two weeks’ statutory paternity leave, Kate plans to depart for her parents’ mansion in Berkshire.

She will reside there - on and off -  for the next six weeks, while her husband completes his present tour of duty with the RAF in Anglesey, North Wales.

The prince will finish his posting as a Search and Rescue pilot at RAF Valley in early September, relocating to London while waiting for his next assignment, meaning the couple can enjoy some quality time together as a new family.

Within weeks – by October at the latest - it is hoped that they will finally be able to move into their new official London residence, Apartment 1A at Kensington Palace

Apartment 1A is actually a spacious four-storey, 20-room property with its own large south-facing walled garden, which takes up half the Clock Tower wing originally designed by Sir Christopher Wren for King William and Queen Mary.

Second port of call: Once William is back in Wales with the RAF, his wife  will head to her parents' mansion in Bucklebury, Berkshire

Improvements: Apartment 1A, which is covered in scaffolding here, is having £1m worth of public money spent on it to transform it into a home fit for a future king and queen

It boasts generous living space, including five reception rooms, three main bedrooms, dressing rooms and bathrooms, a night and day nursery, staff bedrooms and ‘ancillary’ rooms.

Former residents include Princess Louise, Queen Victoria’s daughter, and the late monarch’s grandson, the Marquess of Carisbrooke, followed by, most recently, the Queen’s sister, Princess Margaret, and her husband, Lord Snowdon.

The couple, who moved in following a £1.5million programme of refurbishment in 1963, famously installed a ‘futuristic’ new kitchen (which has since been ripped out) complete with sleek Formica and teak units.

It has been barely touched since the death of the Queen’s sister in 2002, however, and in recent years has been managed by the charity Historic Royal Palaces (HRP), which used the apartment as office and exhibition space.

As HRP has already spent a substantial amount of its own money on remedial work, the Queen was last year forced to compensate it for handing the building over to William and Kate.

This was met by taxpayers and while it has been described by palace sources as ‘fair’, it is believed to be more than £100,000.

Last month it emerged that a further £1million-worth of public money has been lavished so far this year on transforming the apartment into a home fit for a future king and queen.

While William and Kate are footing the bill for decoration and other ‘soft furnishings’ personally (and it is understood that this will include a state-of-the-art new kitchen) all structural work, rewiring, re-plastering and the installation of new environmentally friendly heating and hot water systems, is being met by the government.

So far the bill is £600,000 and rising, much of which is down to the discovery of potentially lethal asbestos. A further £400,000 of taxpayer funds has also been spent on a new roof.

The Duchess, we can also reveal, is being given her pick of priceless antiques from the Royal Collection, one of the largest art collections in the world which is held in trust by the Queen for the nation, with which to furnish her new home.

The Collection comprises more than a million objets d’art collected by successive kings and queens over the past 500 years.

Although it is a charitable institution whose objective is to preserve and display these items in trust for the nation, one of the perks of being a member of the royal family is that they are also permitted to ‘borrow’ items to furnish their private homes.

Kate is said to be having great fun in using her history of art degree to pick out some really special pieces – paintings in particular - but also display cases, dining tables and chairs.

A palace source argued: ‘It is the same for the Queen and other members of the Royal Family with regards to both their private residences and their offices. The alternative is [that] everything sits in storage.'

Contrary to reports that she has employed an interior designer, Kate has eschewed offers of professional help and is, it can be revealed, overseeing the work herself with the help of her private office.

The Duchess is said to have ‘a real interest in design’ and has been encouraged by her father-in-law, Prince Charles, to ‘stamp her personality’ on the project, albeit using British-sourced, environmentally friendly products as much as possible, naturally.

She has been seen perusing fabrics in the upmarket Chelsea Design Centre in London but has also been seen shopping in department stores such as Peter Jones and John Lewis.

‘It’s a big task but she’s confident enough to know exactly what she wants and how she wants to do it,’ says an aide.

Although aides working for the Duke and Duchess admit the works being carried out at Kensington Palace are ‘extensive’, they insist that costs will be kept to a ‘bare minimum’ and maintain much of the outlay will fall to the couple privately.

‘Currently, the apartment is totally uninhabitable without major structural works being carried out and the only public money being used is for remedial work to turn the apartment back into living accommodation,’  said one.

‘The cost of any interior decorating and soft furnishings beyond basic re-plastering and painting and the like will be met by the Royal Family privately.

‘The couple are insistent that any costs to the public must be kept to the bare minimum.’

The spokesman added: ‘It is important to note that the last major works in the apartment took place around the time that Princess Margaret and Lord Snowdon moved into the apartment, following their marriage in 1960.‘

Earlier this year, it was also reported that the Queen has offered the Cambridges the use of Anmer Hall, a Georgian mansion which is part of her private Sandringham Estate in Norfolk, as a country retreat.

Royal advisers have already pushed through a series of planning applications relating to the property, largely to ensure its new royal inhabitants have maximum privacy.
