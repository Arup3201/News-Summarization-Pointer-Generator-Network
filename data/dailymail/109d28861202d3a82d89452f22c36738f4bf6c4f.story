A scale model of the Mohne Dam built in Watford was key to getting the Dambusters raid off the ground.

As anniversary events take place throughout the country to mark to 1943 raid, these replica models are tributes to the planning and strategy behind the daring Raid.

The model was built in 1941, two years before the raid, across a brook to simulate real conditions.

Idyllic: Tucked away in the Watford countryside the humble replica dam is a piece of history

Higher cause: the small-scale recreation was built in the same way as the target Mohne and Eder dams, using the same masonry techniques

Tourist attraction: Secret meetings to plan the raids were held on the site in Watford

Part of History: Barnes Wallis Jr visits the 50th scale model dam in 1997. His father masterminded the raid and the bouncing bomb

It was tested in the run up to the 
attack when decisions were still to be made about how heavy the bombs 
should be and where they would be dropped. 

It
took seven weeks to build and was made out of a scaled-down form of 
masonry, composed of mortar blocks, identical to the intended target.

Explosive tests were then carried out on the replica.

Three trusted employees of the Building Research Establishment in Watford, worked on the covert model.

Bursting through: The replica dam was tested in the research phase of Operation Chastise

Small scale: the replica was tested at different points, so the strategists could plan where to bomb

Work in progress: Theses images show the replica dam as it was constructed. It was built over a brook so that it was an accurate representation of the real thing

Trial and error: The replica dam was designed to prepare an effective strategy for future air raids on German dams

Then and Now: The model dam was built over seven weeks. The team of three engineers worked tirelessly to recreate the shape of the target. Today, visitors can see the model dam where it was built in Watford

Meetings between Barnes Wallis, the inventor of the Bouncing Bomb and Dr Norman Davey, Head of Engineering at BRE, took place at the site near Watford.

Wallis' plans to attack the Mohne and 
Eder dams were outlined and the the model dam was used for testing his strategies.

The model dam's discovery was published 
as the final shots for the film The Dambusters were being recorded. The very first tests at BRE were not included in the film.

The raid was carried out by 133 airmen in 19 Lancaster bombers from the specifically formed 617 squadron.

Anniversary celebration: A flypast at Derwent Dam today marked the 70th anniversary of the raid. The iconic Lancaster bomber was watched by hundreds

The Real Deal: The Mohne dam in Germany's Ruhr Valley. Catastrophic flooding tot he surrounding area was caused in the raid

Film History: The attack was immortalised by the 1955 film starring Michael Redgrave and Richard Todd

Marvel of engineering: The dam at Edersee lake in Waldeck, Germany was breached in the raid. Surrounding villages were badly flooded

World At War: The Operation was an attempt to cripple a major part of the Nazi war economy by hitting the industrial heartland of Germany

It was an attempt to cripple a major 
part of the Nazi war economy by carrying out attacks on three dams in 
the industrial heartland of Germany.

It is considered one of the RAF's most famous Second World War successes.

The
top-secret mission, codenamed Operation Chastise, was led by wing 
commander Guy Gibson and was credited with boosting morale across 
Britain.

The planes, armed 
with scientist Dr Barnes Wallis' bouncing bombs, flew to the Ruhr Valley
either side of midnight on May 16, 1943.

The
Mohne and Eder dams were breached during the raid and the Sorpe 
damaged. The attack was immortalised by the 1955 film starring Michael 
Redgrave and Richard Todd.

Even
with the loss of life, the operation was hailed an incredible success 
at the time but in recent decades historians have downplayed its 
effects.

Picturesque: Lake Eder was targeted in the Dambusters Raid. The Möhne and Edersee Dams were breached

Mission: Eight aircraft, such as the Lancaster, failed to return from Operation Chastise. Three men became prisoners of war and 53 were killed

Birds eye view: Taken two months after the bombing of the Eder Dam, this aerial view shows the reservoir is completely dry

After the attack: Water gushed through the Mohne Dam after it was bombed by the No. 617 Squadron

Days gone by: Wing Commander Guy Gibson (left), the Commanding Officer of 617 Squadron, and Sir Barnes Wallis (right), inventor of the bouncing bomb, used in the Lancaster bomber raids on the dams
