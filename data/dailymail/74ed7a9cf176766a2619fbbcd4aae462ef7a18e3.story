No mother of the year: This 37-year-old woman, whose booking photo has been blurred to protect her daughter's privacy, is charged with child endangerment after it was revealed the 12-year-old was pregnant 

An Iowa mother was arrested on child endangerment charges after it was discovered that her 12-year-old daughter became pregnant after being allowed to sleep with a grown man.

The 37-year-old woman from Newton was taken into custody Friday following an investigation that revealed that the mother did nothing to stop 24-year-old Jacob White, a family friend, from sharing her then-11-year-old daughter’s bed.

MailOnline is not releasing the woman's name to protect the identity of her daughter due to the nature of the crime.  

The mother allegedly ignored comments from multiple witnesses that White was having sex with the girl.

According to police, the victim also tried to tell her mother about White's behavior, but the woman would not listen.

When a recent doctor’s visit revealed that the young girl was expecting, the 12-year-old allegedly said to her mother:’I tried to tell you several times,' stated a police report obtained by Newton Daily News. 

Jacob White now faces a third-degree sexual abuse charge for allegedly impregnating the child.

The girl and the man twice her age reportedly slept together in April and May, but the mother took no action.

The Newton woman's neighbors told WHO-TV they were not surprised by the allegations against her, claiming that her house is known in the area as a place where random people come and go at all hours of the day.

The mother is currently out of jail. She has been ordered not to have any contact with her daughter. Her next court appearance was scheduled for September 9.

Police said the woman is facing criminal charges because she is the parent of a minor who knowingly permitted the continuing physical abuse or sexual abuse of a child.
