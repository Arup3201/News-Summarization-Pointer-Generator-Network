Armed police are now guarding the headquarters of spy agency GCHQ 24 hours a day amid fears it could be targeted in a terror attack similar to the weekend's atrocity in Denmark, it was revealed today.

Security has been tightened after the attacks in Copenhagen by lone gunman Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein and MI5 believes it is 'only a matter of time' before a similar attack in Britain.

For the first time armed Ministry of Defence Police will guard the GCHQ listening station full time in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, in response to the heightened terror threat.

Threat: The current threat level of an attack has been set by the Government as severe, meaning a strike on Britain is ‘highly likely’ 

The current threat level of an attack has been set by the Government as severe, meaning a strike is ‘highly likely’.

But it is not known whether officers have been deployed at GCHQ because of a specific threat.

A GCHQ spokesman said of the decision to deploy armed police: ‘The security posture of our sites, including the safety of our staff, is under constant review.’

He added that it was the first time full time armed guards had been deployed at the site.

Spy chiefs last night warned that lone wolf terror attacks are now Britain’s ‘biggest fear’ in the wake of Europe’s latest atrocity.

However, officials accept there is little they can do to prevent such tragedies because those involved often live appparently normal lives within communities and give no hint of their intentions.  

A counter-terror source last night said lone wolf gunmen or suicide bombers, with no obvious link to known extremists, were ‘our biggest fear’. 

High profile: The leaks by Edward Snowden put GCHQ's work in the spotlight and experts believe this has made it more of a target

The insider told the Daily Mirror: ‘Loners are unpredictable and by their very nature tend not to make their intentions known in a way that can be intercepted.

‘Agencies have smashed many major mass casualty plots, but smaller attacks by one or two radicalised terrorists whose warped plans go below the radar make detection difficult. These people are out there, without doubt.’

It was revealed last night that the jihadi who killed two people in the Copenhagen atrocity was inspired by the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris last month. 

Omar Abdel Hamid El-Hussein was shot at a train station in Copenhagen after he opened fire on armed officers in the early hours of Sunday morning.

The 22-year-old fanatic murdered film director Finn Norgaard, 55, while indiscriminately firing an automatic rifle at a free speech debate at a cafe on Saturday afternoon. 

His intended target was thought to have been the controversial Swedish cartoonist Lars Vilks, who has previously depicted the prophet Muhammad as a stray dog. Mr Vilks escaped unscathed.

Some ten hours later the gunman shot Dan Uzan in the head at a synagogue holding a bat mitzvah celebration for 80 people. Mr Uzan, 37, an economist at the Danish treasury, had been acting as a volunteer security guard for the event.

Two police officers, who were at the synagogue to provide extra security following the earlier cafe shooting, were shot in the arms and legs. Three others were injured in the earlier attack. All are expected to survive.

The attack at the Krudttønden café bears striking similarities to the massacre at the Charlie Hebdo office in Paris last month, in which two fanatics murdered 12 people. Their accomplice shot dead a policewoman and four hostages at a kosher supermarket.
