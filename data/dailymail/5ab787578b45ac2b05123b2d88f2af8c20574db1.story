Suspect: This police sketch of a man who attempted to abduct two children in September is being circulated in hopes that it could lead to a break in the Jessica Ridgeway case

Police are searching for a man involved in two attempted abductions near Denver elementary schools in the weeks before Jessica Ridgeway disappeared.

Jessica, 10, vanished on the morning of October 5. Her mother reported her missing after she 
received a phone call saying the girl had not arrived at her school.

Her dismembered body was found about seven miles from her home on October 10.

The first incident dates back to 
September 9 when a child was approached by a man near Quaker Acres Park 
in Arvada located very close to Warder Elementary School.

The suspect allegedly offered candy to the child in question- whose age and sex have not been released.

Just three days later, a similar incident occurred near Fitzmorris Elementary School.

Both children ran away quickly and 
told adults.

According to CBS 4, the incidents prompted county school officials to circulate
a warning letter to all principals in the area warning of the man, 
thought to be between the ages of 20 and 40 years old with a short 
beard, brown hair, driving a blue four-door sedan.

The description of this suspect led to a false alarm that sent Denver police into overdrive Saturday night when a young man approached a 13-year-old boy and asked the boy to get in his car.

The boy ran into his home and alerted his mother who then took a picture of the suspect sitting in a red hat and red jersey in a dark blue Ford Corolla.

Found: A body found in a Denver, Colorado park has been identified as missing girl, Jessica Ridgeway

was found in a suburban Denver park on Friday

Police initially thought that the man 
in question could have been connected to the September attempted 
abductions and possibly Jessica's disappearance, but the suspect has 
since been ruled out.

Following
the widespread publication of the mother's picture of the suspect in 
his blue sedan, the driver turned himself in to police and explained 
that it was a misunderstanding.

False alarm: A mother took this picture of a teenage boy who approached her son but the boy turned himself in and was ruled out of the case because he was not involved

The
man, who was actually just an 18-year-old boy, said that he approached 
the 13-year-old in order to ask him about his ex-girlfriend who lived 
nearby.

According to 9News, the 18-year-old said that he wanted the younger boy to go up to his ex-girlfriend's door to get her attention.

Help: Police say they have received hundreds of phone calls from people giving tips into her disappearance

Family problems: Jessica's mother and father have been locked in a custody dispute over the little girl after the couple separated

Speaking out: Sarah Ridgeway, right, and 
Jeremiah Bryant, left, both said they had nothing to do with their 
10-year-old daughter, Jessica, going missing on her way to school a week ago

Police said that while the teen made a
'really bad choice', he has since been cleared of any involvement in 
the September abductions. That said, he may still face harassment 
charges.

The mother who took the picture was 
hyper vigilant because her home is just a few miles away from where 
Jessica's body was found. 

In spite of the police sketch released
from those descriptions, authorities still require the public's help 
and have since received more than 1,500 tips. Authorities also have 
searched more than 500 homes and more than 1,000 vehicles but still need
the public's help, Mr Yacone said.

Proximity: The numerous instances of attempted abductions are all within miles of each other

Prior attempt: The first incident dates back to September 9 when a child was approached by a man near Quaker Acres Park in Arvada located very close to Warder Elementary School

Round two: Just three days later, a similar incident occurred near Fitzmorris Elementary School

'Our focus has changed from the search
for Jessica to a mission of justice for Jessica,' Westminster Police 
Chief Lee Birk said Friday.

'We recognize there is a predator at large in our community.'

Jessica was last seen beginning a 
short walk from her home to Witt Elementary School on the morning of 
October 5. She never arrived.

Discovery: Investigators carry away the dismembered body which was found behind an abandoned cabin

A search by hundreds of law officers 
did not start until hours later because Jessica's mother works nights 
and slept through a call from school officials saying Jessica wasn't 
there.

Jessica's backpack was found on a sidewalk in Superior on Oct. 7, some 6 miles northwest of her Westminster home.

On Wednesday, authorities discovered a
body in Arvada, about 7 miles west of her home, in a park in Arvada. 
They announced the body was Jessica's on Friday.

Over the week, police said Jessica had
been abducted. They don't suspect her parents, Sarah Ridgeway of 
Westminster, and Jeremiah Bryant of Missouri.
