After the travel chaos which preceded the game perhaps Jay McEveley can be forgiven for the erratic hand gestures at the back-post. Was he hailing a cab? Or stopping a Routemaster?

Sheffield United were 18 minutes from a clean sheet in the first leg of this Capital One Cup semi-final, when McEveley challenged Roberto Soldado for a deep cross.

First his right-hand went up in a hopeful appeal for offside and then his left hand swung through the line of the ball, clearing it somewhere into the crowd.

Ratings by MARTHA KELNER 

Helped by his assistant, referee Neil Swarbrick awarded the penalty and Andros Townsend stepped forward to smash Tottenham into the lead with a confident strike and give them a glimpse of Wembley.

That was all that separated the League One team from their Barclays Premier League hosts.

Overall, Spurs were probably worth the narrow victory having dominated the game while rarely troubling Sheffield United goalkeeper Mark Howard, but this tie is not over.

Nigel Clough’s side proved that they are not short on belief. 

The game ended with them on the attack in search of an equaliser, and they coped well with pre-match problems which saw the game delayed because United’s team-bus was stuck on the congested streets of north London.

Travel issues aside, the South Yorkshire team must have made their way to White Hart Lane in confident mood, having reached the semi-finals of last season’s FA Cup and beaten West Ham and Southampton on the road to the same stage of this competition. 

They have not reached a major final since 1936, and Clough has acquired a giant-killing knack. There was no inferiority complex as they opened at a strong tempo, hustling Spurs, refusing to let them settle.

In midfield they snapped into tackles and spreading the ball wide and goalkeeper Howard launched it forward with great gusto when given the chance.

Jamie Murphy enjoyed early flickers of success against Kyle Walker, Tottenham’s former Sheffield United defender, as the 4,000 visiting fans sang: 'Kyle Walker, he wants us to win'.

Michael Doyle lashed one effort over in the chaos of the first 10 minutes, before the Premier League side were able to impose any degree of control.

Even then, it was unconvincing. Adebayor, starting for the first time since early November, was unable to link up and allowed his frustrations to boil over when he flung an arm at Louis Reed a few yards from the Sheffield United bench. 

Clough and his coaching staff reacted angrily. They were certain an elbow had been thrown with intent as Reed crashed to the deck.

There was certainly heavy contact, although it was Adebayor’s left hand which caught the 17-year-old around the jawline, rather than his elbow.

Still, it was a hand in the face and Mauricio Pochettino must have been relieved when Swarbrick pulled out a yellow card rather than a red one.

Many Tottenham supporters were surprised to see Emmanuel Adebayor made captain for the night, given that he has played just 32 minutes of football since November, his future at White Hart Lane is in doubt and he looked largely uninterested against Sunderland at the weekend. This time he managed to avoid being booed by his own fans at the start, but was seriously off the pace and ineffectual.

In the absence of Hugo Lloris and with Younes Kaboul on the bench, the Tottenham boss had taken the strange decision to make Adebayor his captain for the night.

Just four days earlier, some Spurs fans had booed the Togo striker as he came on as a substitute, unhappy with the application of their £100,000-a-week top-earner this season.

His reception was warmer on Wednesday, but supporters cheered the change when he was replaced by Soldado midway through the second half.

They prefer the fella who cannot score but clearly tries, and especially if he helps them over the line by winning a penalty.  

It would have been far worse had Adebayor been dismissed for his careless challenge on Reed, who accepted an apologetic handshake before the game went on.

Adebayor's evening came to an end after 65 minutes when he was substituted by Roberto Soldado to boos from the home fans, which seemed to make Nigel Clough chuckle 

Clough was still demanding answers from fourth official Roger East as Jamal Campbell-Ryce burst inside from the right and zipped a low cross-shot close but the brief interruption energised the home team. 

With England boss Roy Hodgson in the crowd, Townsend became more influential, running at left-back Bob Harris, although his delivery was as haphazard as ever.

On the other flank, Harry Kane found it difficult to get into the game for the first half-hour, although he was more effective when he drifted inside as the game went on. 

Eric Dier was the first to test United’s ‘keeper Howard, with a powerful header from a free-kick swung in from the right by Townsend.

Dier’s contact was strong but he could not direct the ball well and Howard was able to push the effort aside.

Christian Eriksen’s long ball over the top was collected by Adebayor with a decent first touch but he screwed a volley well wide under pressure from McEveley.

Dier went close with a glancing header, again from an in-swinging Townsend free-kick, this time inches wide.

But Stefan Scougall fired a warning Tottenham’s way when Ben Davies was dispossessed by Reed deep in his own territory.  

Scougall’s effort from the edge of the penalty area was narrowly off target.

Spurs dominated possession and forced Sheffield United back as the second half went on, but Clough’s defensive unit were organised and committed even if they did start to show signs of tiring.

All four of Townsend’s goals for Spurs this season have been penalties — two in the Europa League, one in the Capital One Cup and one in the Premier League 

McEveley was booked for a mistimed slide on Townsend and some panic set in but optimism was rising among the noisy United fans.

They had seen another performance to belie the club’s third tier existence and their remains the possibility of another trip to Wembley and their first major final since 1936.

Bradford’s adventure two years ago has given hope to all lower league teams in this position, but Spurs have the edge thanks to McEveley’s hand signals and Townsend’s penalty.
