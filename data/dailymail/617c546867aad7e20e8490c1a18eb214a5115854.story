A
 15-year-old Somali boy who survived a nearly six-hour flight stowed in 
the wheel well of a Hawaii-bound jet has been returned to California and
 placed in the custody of social services, the San Jose Mercury News 
reported.

The teen was 
transferred back to Santa Clara, California, without his father, who has
 not been allowed to see his son since the teen stowed away to Hawaii on
 April 20, the newspaper said on Saturday.

In
 a statement after his son ran away, father Abdilahi Yusuf Abdi said the
 boy had been 'struggling adjusting to life' in America.

The
 Department of Family and Children's Services in Santa Clara County did 
not immediately respond on Sunday to Reuters' request for comment about 
the teen's custody status.

The
 teen left protective custody in Hawaii late last week, according to 
Hawaii's Department of Human Services, but no further details on his 
whereabouts were provided because of his age.

The Mercury News reported that the teen was flown back to California after a court hearing in Hawaii on Friday.

The
 boy had been recovering at a Hawaii hospital since he staggered out of 
the airplane's wheel well last month, surviving a flight across the 
Pacific Ocean in subfreezing temperatures and with little oxygen.

The
 boy told investigators he was trying to go to Africa to find his 
mother, Ubah Mohamed Abdulle, who is living in a refugee camp in 
Ethiopia.

In a radio 
interview last week with the Voice of America, Abdulle said she was 
divorced from her husband, who lives in Santa Clara with their son and 
two of his siblings.

'They were even told that I was dead, but they recently found out that I was alive,' she told the broadcaster.

The
 boy's father arrived in Honolulu from California about a week after the
 incident but was not able to see or talk to his son, the Mercury News 
said.
