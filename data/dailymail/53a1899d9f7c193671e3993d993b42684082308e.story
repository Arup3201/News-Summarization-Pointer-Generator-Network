Rail commuters were suffering delays and cancellations this morning due to an electrical supply problem at a major station.

The problem was affecting rush-hour travellers using the Southern train company’s services in and out of London Bridge station.

Commuter Richard Knights  told this morning of a 'static queue' at London Bridge just to get off the platform.

There were also difficulties today for London Overground passengers who had no service between Crystal Palace/West Croydon and New Cross Gate due to a broken-down train at Brockley.

Trains from Highbury & Islington that normally terminate at Crystal Palace/West Croydon were terminating at New Cross Gate.

And trains that normally start from Crystal Palace/West Croydon to Highbury & Islington were starting from Surrey Quays.

Annoyed: Commuters were directing their anger towards Southern following the train delays this morning

The morning rush-hour problems follow hold-ups last night for London Overground passengers in north-west London when a broken-down train at Wembley led to delays and cancellations.

Another broken-down train this morning, near Guildford in Surrey, meant rush-hour delays for First Great Western and South West Trains’ passengers travelling between Havant/Redhill and Guildford.

In the West Midlands a signalling problem was leading to delays to London Midland services between Stratford-upon-Avon and Stourbridge Junction, while a problem with lineside equipment meant delays to trains between Smethwick Galton Bridge and Birmingham Snow Hill.

In Scotland, a broken-down train between Hamilton West and Hamilton Central was causing delays.
