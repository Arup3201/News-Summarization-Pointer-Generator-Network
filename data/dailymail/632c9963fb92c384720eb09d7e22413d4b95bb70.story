Former President George H.W. Bush 
celebrated his 89th birthday on Wednesday, and he celebrated by 
encouraging people to don his new trademark: socks.

But
 not just any run-of-the-mill pair of dress socks will do - to match up 
in the sock department with the 41st president of the United States, 
your foot fashions need to be loud, flamboyant and unpredictable.

Over the past few months, the elder 
former President Bush made headlines for his interesting choices in foot
 decor, including wearing bright pink socks to the dedication of his 
son's presidential library. As he recently told his granddaughter Jenna 
Bush Hagar, the man 'like[s] a good sock.'

So
 to celebrate his birthday, the George Bush Presidential Library and 
Museum encouraged people to tweet photos of their most 'exuberant' 
socks.

'Select 
birthday sock photos will be chosen and given to President Bush for his 
89th birthday,' the presidential library explained.
