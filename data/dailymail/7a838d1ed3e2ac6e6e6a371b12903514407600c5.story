Ebony Burks managed to talk her way into 300 days in prison for contempt of court

This video shows the hilarious moment a woman talked her way into a 300-day prison sentence for contempt of court.

Ebony Burks, 32, appeared in Elyria Municipal Court, Ohio, accused of domestic violence and assault. Speaking to her over video feed, judge Gary Bennett told her she was not to have contact with either of the victims involved.

Burks took issue with the fact she would not be able to contact or see her grandfather, Shedrick McCray, because she lived in his house.

After she lost her cool, Burks was 
initially handed down 30 days by Judge Bennett. But as she continued to 
argue and speak aggressively towards the judge, he gradually increased 
the prison sentence.

Just
 as she looked set to be imprisoned for six months, Burks told the 
judge: ‘F*** you.’ He then gave her 300 days – the longest contempt of 
court sentence ever handed down at the court.

On hearing she wouldn’t be allowed to go to Mr McCray’s home, Burks said: ‘How you going to tell me I can’t go to my home?’

To which Bennett replied: ‘I just did.’

Burks hit back: ‘Well, I bet I do.’ At this point the judge gave her 30 days for contempt of court.

As this gradually increased to 180 days, she said: ‘So what?… So?… Okay, and?’

When he reached 180 days, Burks walked off the screen. A guard then came to the camera and apologised to Judge Bennett.

Judge Bennett asked Burks, who can be heard off-screen: ‘You got anything else to say, Ms Burks?’

‘F*** you,’ she responds, before Judge Bennett hands down 300 days.

Afterwards, Judge Bennett told the Lorain County Chronicle: ‘I’m usually pretty even across the board, but she got me riled.’
