A Mexican national living illegally in the US for decades was arrested Tuesday in connection to a massive identity theft case spanning 30 years in which he allegedly used the name of an American citizen to defraud the government.

Prosecutors say Ramon Perez-Rivera's scheme was so ingenious that a judge unwittingly changed the name of the person whose identity he had stolen to his own real name.

The 33-count indictment outlining one of the most unusual identity theft cases in the country accuses the 81-year-old Perez-Rivera of assuming a false identity to obtain food stamps and Medicaid, register to vote and obtain a US passport and a driver's license. 

Unsealed Tuesday in federal court in Wichita, Kansas, the indictment against Perez-Rivera and his 82-year-old wife, Antonia Vargas-Ortega, outlines a history of unlawful entry into the United States that dates as far back as the 1950s.  

Stolen life: Ramon Perez-Rivera, 81, a Mexico native living illegally in Kansas, has been indicted on 33 counts of identity theft and fraud for allegedly stealing the identity of an American citizen 30 years ago 

The couple were married in their hometown of Romita, Buanajuato, Mexico, in 1961. One of their adult children, Antonia Vargas-Perez, 47, also has been charged with immigration-related offenses, said US Attorney Barry Grissom. 

The indictment offers a glimpse at an immigrant family's life in the shadows that spanned decades — and left in tatters the identity of the 86-year-old Arizona man whose identity was hijacked.

The government contends Perez-Rivera succeeded in fooling scores of state and federal agencies — with the exception of the times he tried to get Supplemental Social Security Income benefits from the Social Security Administration, where the scam finally unraveled.

Perez-Rivera faces a court appearance Wednesday on charges of aggravated identity theft as well as counts related to making false statements in order to obtain a passport, food stamps and Medicaid benefits as well as register to vote; lying to a federal agent; misusing a Social Security number to obtain a Kansas driver's license; and fraudulently attempting to get Social Security income benefits.

His wife, now a naturalized US citizen, also faces charges that include aggravated identity theft, making a false statement to the Social Security Administration and harboring a person unlawfully in the United States. 

Travel documents: The 81-year-old suspect allegedly used the false identity to obtain a US passport in 1996

Assistant US Attorney Brent Anderson, who has prosecuted hundreds of immigration-related cases, said he has never seen one in which a defendant allegedly changed the identity theft victim's name to his own name.

The couple settled in California around 1980. Immigration officials arrested Perez-Rivera in 1981 for being in the country unlawfully, but did not take his wife into custody because of three adolescent children in the home, according to the indictment. 

Instead of surrendering herself to immigration officials the next day as promised, she fled. Court documents not indicate the outcome of his arrest.

Federal prosecutors said the identity theft victim was born in California. He is identified in the indictment only as T.A.P.

The government contends that the suspect has been using T.A.P.'s identity since 1979, and in 1996 Perez-Rivera filed a name change petition in Ventura County, California, Superior Court in which he falsely represented himself to be T.A.P. 

The court granted the petition and entered an order changing the name of T.A.P. to Ramon Perez-Rivera.

Voter fraud: The indictment says Perez-Rivera unlawfully registered to vote in 1999 and voted at least once, in the 2000 general election

Perez-Rivera assumed the victim's Social Security number, date and place of birth, and at times even the names of T.A.P.'s parents, prosecutors say. 

He then used the court order to amend T.A.P.'s California birth record to reflect the change of name, according to the indictment. 

He was able to get the Social Security Administration to change the name on T.A.P.'s account and issue Perez-Rivera a Social Security card. By 1997, he had obtained a U.S. passport.

The family moved to Kansas in 1998, and the following year he began receiving Medicaid benefits and food stamps. 

He also registered to vote in Sedgwick County in 1999, and an online check by The Associated Press of voting records indicates he voted at least once, in the 2000 general election.

In June 2011, an investigator from the Social Security Administration interviewed Perez-Rivera and seized all his identity documents. 

'Two years ago, we decided not to pursue charges in this case due the age and circumstances of the defendants,' Grissom said, 'but they allegedly continued to engage in the same conduct that brought them to the attention of law enforcement officers in the first place.

'At some point, people have to take responsibility for their actions, whether they are 18 or 80. The scope of the allegations in this case is such that the interests of justice simply required action on our part.'

The government says Perez-Rivera got a new Kansas driver's license less than a month later by claiming he had lost his old one. Prosecutors say he tried in 2012 to replace the seized U.S. passport, falsely declaring again he was US citizen. That time, his application was denied.

Perez-Rivera faces maximum sentences of 10 years on the passport fraud and document fraud counts. He also faces the two-year mandatory sentences on five aggravated identity theft counts.

His wife and alleged partner in crime could be looking at up to five years in prison on the false statement charges and a mandatory sentence of two years on two aggravated identity theft counts.
