Royal Ascot is one of the most eagerly anticipated events in the Summer Season. Synonymous with old English glamour, it places high value on style and sophistication.

Last year the Royal race meet issued tips to racegoers to help them adhere to the race course's new dress codes - some of which involved visitors wearing larger hats and longer skirts.

This year, the race course has teamed up with top British designers, milliner Philip Treacy and Emilia Wickstead, among others, to style a short film celebrating the elegance of Ascot.

In the film,. which comes accompanied by a high fashion photoshoot, the allure of the race meet is been brought to life - and given a modern twist.

Entitled The Colour and The Glory, the breathtaking video features shots of models on set wearing tradition high-end race day attire interspersed with footage of real life races and vibrant splashes of coloured ink in water.

‘The
Colour and The Glory’ represents the heady mix of high fashion, the 
feelings of anticipation, as the horses thunder down the track and roar 
of the crowd.

The
accompanying music begins at a tranquil pace, but soon quickens to 
mimic the sound of horses hooves, building the tension and excitement 
of the video, and helping to capture some of the wonder of Ascot.

Globally renowned 
milliner, Phillip Treacy says: ‘Royal Ascot is iconic in the world of 
racing. It is the ultimate marriage of the sport of kings, style, 
elegance, hats and royalty. Because of this combination it is unique'

Charles
Barnett, Chief Executive at Ascot Racecourse, said: ‘We’d like to think
that the campaign image for this year’s Royal Meeting perfectly 
captures the colour and excitement that makes it such a defining event 
in the British calendar.

'It is designed to merge the 
essential fashion element of Royal Ascot effortlessly with the image of 
the one of the stars of Royal Ascot 2012, Black Caviar, who could have 
run anywhere in the world after conquering Australia, but was aimed only
for the Diamond Jubilee Stakes.

'Reflecting
the quality and unique international nature of the racing at Royal 
Ascot together with fashion at the highest level was very much high on 
our minds when putting this image together.'

Royal Ascot will take place from 
Tuesday 18 to Saturday 22 June 2012 and is the world’s most famous 
race meeting, with an annual attendance of 300,000 people. 

Packed
with celebrities from across the globe, and of course, our own royal 
family, it is always a spectacular event, and if this year’s campaign 
video is anything to go by, 2013 will be no exception.
