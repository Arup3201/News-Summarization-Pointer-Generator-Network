Charlie Sheen has placed himself front and center in the  in the Philadelphia restaurant versus LeSean McCoy kerfuffle.

The Two and a Half Men star tweeted his support Wednesday to stiffed PYT server Rob Knelly in the form of a $1000 tip.

That should more than make up for the 20 cents he received from the Eagles running back on a check that totaled over $60. 

'dear Tommy Up,' Sheen tweeted Wednesday afternoon, referring to the owner of the Philly burger joint. 'Please tell Rob K I'm pledging 1000 dollars to him for the tip debacle just wanna help. c' 

Pledging to help: Charlie Sheen has added his two cents to the LeSean McCoy tipping row in the form of $1000 pledged to the stiffed Philadelphia waiter

McCoy was first publicly called out by the owner of a local eatery for leaving a 20-cent tip on a bill totaling more than $60.

The Philadelphia burger joint PYT shared a receipt online showing what was described as Mr McCoy's paltry tip.

'The twenty cent tip that the Eagles' LeSean McCoy just left our server on his $60 check is going to come in really handy for that new official NFL McCoy jersey he had his heart set on,' the message that accompanied the receipt read. 'That is a .03% tip. New record!'

Paltry tip: The owner of Philadelphia's PYT burger joint shared this receipt from Monday showing the 20-cent tip that Eagles star LeSean McCoy left for a server on a $61.56 tab

According to the document in question, McCoy and three guests patronized PYT on North Hancock Street at around 3pm Monday, ordering $57 worth of food, plus $4.56 in taxes.

McCoy paid the tab with his Visa credit card, writing in by hand a '$00.20' tip for a grand total of $61.76.

McCoy's party of four was served that day by a waiter named Rob, identified later in an NJ.com article as Rob Knelly.

The PYT staffer revealed to the paper that LeSean McCoy and his guests were being loud and rude from the moment they sat down at the table.

‘I kept my cool for as long as I could, where you just don’t want them yelling and cursing you,’ Knelly, who is a Baltimore Raves fan, said.

‘I asked some questions; they weren't really responsive. They were cursing, making derogatory comments. I put their order in and forgot one of their appetizers, which I apologized for. They ordered things and, once they got it, said “We ain't eating this s***. We don't want it."’

After giving the patrons’ drink orders to the bartender, Knelly said McCoy and his party continued to call for him.

‘They didn’t know my name,’ Knelly told NBC Philadelphia. ‘They just said, “you’re my server right?” They were being rude so after I gave them their food I didn’t go back to them until they were done. I just avoided their rudeness.’

Fast-food landmark: Tommy Up, the owner of the popular eatery, wrote on Facebook that everyone at PYT was excited to see McCoy, but he responded by making derogatory comments and mistreating the staff

When a Philadelphia Daily News reporter reached out to McCoy for comment, the NFL player said, 'It's bull****, man,' but he declined to further elaborate on the tip controversy.

In 2012, LeSean McCoy signed a five-year contract extension with the Eagles worth $45million. 

Slip-up: Knelly admitted that he forgot to bring an appetizer for the group, but apologized for his mistake 

The image of the receipt posted on PYT’s Facebook by the owner has been shared more than 2,800 times, drawing sharp criticism from many commenters for calling out McCoy as a bad tipper.

User Taryn Woods wrote: ‘This is very distasteful and unprofessional of PYT. So what if the man left a .20 cent tip? It’s his right to be cheap or more than likely disappointed with the service.’

Another Facebook commenter Phil Penny wondered: ‘is there a minimum we should tip to avoid you posting receipts online?’

In response to the firestorm, the proprietor of the burger joint, Tommy Up, penned a lengthy status update Tuesday afternoon offering his side of the story.

Mr Up opened his letter by taking full responsibility for sharing the receipt online and saying that he stands firmly by his staff.

He then went on to describe how ‘pumped’ his employees – many of them loyal Eagles fans – were to see the famed running back walk through the doors of their establishment.

‘Mr McCoy and his friend sat inside at a booth next to my management and next to me. They were given excellent service. Impeccable service. If anything, our server was a little nervous as was our food runner, because they are big, big fans,’ the owner wrote. 

Millionaire's response: The running back, who signed a five-year contract extension with the Eagles worth $45million in 2012, responded to the tip-gate by saying the eatery's claims were 'bull****'

‘He and his group, from the moment they sat down, were verbally abusive to our staff in the most insulting ways. The derogatory statements about women and their sheer contempt for the staff serving them wasn't the end, however.

‘After Mr McCoy and his group left I looked over and saw their server, my friend, with his head bowed down and with a very confused look on his face. I took the receipt out of his hand and I couldn't believe that anyone could be so callous. Mr McCoy had left a .03% tip for our staff.

‘Our staff that was beyond excited to see him walk into our burger joint and was excited to serve him. That's twenty cents on a tab of over $60. Twenty cents that our server has to split with the food runner and the bartender. Two dimes from an insulting multimillionaire.

The owner went on to dismiss reports the McCoy and his party received poor service as ‘a complete slanderous lie.’

‘At the end of the day, I did what I felt my heart told me to do. And I don't want anything from Mr McCoy, but...maybe an apology to his server who gave him excellent service would be cool,’ Mr Up summed up, before directing all hate mail to his email address.
