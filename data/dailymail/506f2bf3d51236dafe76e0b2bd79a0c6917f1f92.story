British passengers told of their terror today after their flight home was forced to make an emergency landing due to loss of cabin pressure.

The Jet 2 flight LS516 started to rapidly descend just an hour after departing from Paphos, Cyprus, to Newcastle last night.

The plane dropped thousands of feet in minutes, while oxygen masks were deployed for passengers.

The aircraft was forced to divert to Sofia Airport in Bulgaria, where emergency crews were waiting on the tarmac. 

Passengers then had to spend the night in the Bulgarian capital, before boarding an early replacement flight to Newcastle this morning.

Today, Vicki Standing, who was travelling home after a two week holiday in Paphos, said the experience had left her 'shaken up'.

“It was really scary, I was shaking and I felt sick,' said Ms Standing, who was joined on the flight by her parents Jan, 60, and Neil, 67, and her two sons, Thomas, 14, and three-year-old James.

'I said to my my oldest son "there is something wrong here". My ears were popping and we were losing altitude. 

'Then the seat belt signs came on, but there was no turbulence. The next thing I remember is hearing the word emergency and that made me panic.

'I thought we were crash landing. Everyone’s mask deployed apart from mine. I clawed at it until it came down.

'It was about five minutes of not knowing what was happening. I spent the five minutes cuddling my youngest son and holding the mask to his face. If he didn’t have it on he may have gone unconscious.

'After five minutes were up, we must have reached 10,000 feet. It is like something you see in movies, I didn’t think it would happen to us.

'It kind of spoiled my holiday a little bit, but it gave us something to talk about.'

Ms Standing, from Darlington, said she and the other passengers had been forced to wait at Sofia Airport for around seven-and-a-half hours before boarding the replacement flight.

'We got to the airport at half past seven, their time, and did not leave until three o’clock in the morning,' she said.

'My dad is scared of flying and he was getting chest pains just thinking about getting back on the flight home. We had to get a different flight which was sent from Manchester.

'Everyone was chatting a lot about it. People were saying there was a man on board in his twenties who had to be hypnotised and take medication to fly.

'They were saying he refused to get back on a flight again and they had to get him back to Newcastle by not flying.

'A lot of people were shaken up.'

Maxine Reed, who was also travelling on the Jet 2 flight, said: 'They lost cabin pressure. The oxygen masks fell down for us and we landed in Sofia for safety measures.

'The plane’s altitude dropped. The plane was nearly full and there was kids on board.

'I had a flashing thought of "this is it". They let us know what was happening as soon as it was stabilised.

'We were taken in to terminal and separated from other passengers so we didn’t need to clear security again. We got back to Newcastle at about 5am this morning.'

A Jet 2 spokesman said today: 'Flight LS516 from Paphos to Newcastle diverted to Sofia Airport yesterday afternoon as a precautionary measure due to a technical issue.

'The aircraft landed safely and passengers returned to Newcastle on a replacement aircraft early this morning.

'We would like to apologise to passengers for any inconvenience this may have caused.'
