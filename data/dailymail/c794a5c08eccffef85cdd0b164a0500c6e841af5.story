Elated football fans gearing up for next year's World Cup will face the added cost of forking out for a new shirt less than a year after the latest strip hit the shops.

England's kit suppliers Nike are set to cash in on Roy Hodgson's team making it to Brazil after securing qualification with a 2-0 win over Poland on Tuesday, by launching four national team shirts in less than a year.

Nike, who revealed new home and away kits in May, will produce two more strips ahead of the tournament - a white home shirt and red away top.

England fans buoyant at watching Roy Hodgson's team secure World Cup qualification with a 2-0 win over Poland, are set to face the added cost of forking out for new replica shirts ahead of next summer's tournament

It means the latest jerseys - priced at £70 - will only be current for the next 12 games, eight at home and four away fixtures.

Siobhan Freegard of the website netmums.com, told The Sun: 'The World Cup is going to mean a world of pain for parents.

'There will undoubtedly be a huge marketing push to encourage kids to pester their parents for the latest shirts.

'But few families can afford them all. Releasing four kits in a year is naked greed and nothing to do with football.'

Nike will produce a new home kit to replace the shirt worn by Jack Wilshere at Tuesday's win over Poland, left, and a new version of the red away strip worn by Rickie Lambert at the World Cup qualifier clash with Ukraine

And Dad Simon Ackroyd from Wilden in Bedfordshire, whose daughter Poppy, 10, is a fan, told the paper: 'As if kits aren't expensive enough I'll now have to buy Poppy a new one, on top of the one this summer.'

Nike took over the £25million shirt contract with England from their subsidiary company Umbro in May.

A Nike spokeswoman said: ‘These are 
unusual circumstances because of when we started the FA agreement and 
the need to recognise England’s 150 anniversary this year.

'After the 
World Cup a normal kit cycle will resume. The home shirt will stay the 
same for two years and the away one for 18 months.’

The lift from World Cup qualification through sponsorship bonus agreements and extra licensing deals is expected to be worth in excess of £10million to the FA.
