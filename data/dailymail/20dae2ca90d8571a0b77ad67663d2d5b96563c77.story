It is the kind of telling off more usually earned by disruptive school pupils.

But yesterday it was a mystery couple at the National Union of Teachers’ conference who were given a scolding after being spotted ‘canoodling’ in the back row.

The amorous pair, who have not been identified, were caught sharing an intimate moment in the balcony at the Riviera International Centre in Torquay.

Conference: The lovebirds, who have not been identified, were spotted together on the balcony at the Riviera International Conference Centre in Torquay, Devon

Delegates, who have been harangued by militant colleagues over the last few days,  complained they had been ‘distracted’ by ‘canoodling’ going on behind them.

This prompted the union’s president, Marilyn Harrop, to reprimand the couple for ‘behaviour unbecoming to our union’.

Mrs Harrop seized an opportunity between debates on special needs education and false allegations against teachers to inform  delegates she had received a complaint.

She told the conference: ‘Apparently there was an incident in the balcony of a couple behaving in a manner unbecoming to the union.

'I don’t know whether this was because they were bored or whether it was because they were really fired up by the debate. But no more please.’

An NUT spokesman said it was not known whether the pair were teachers or observers, who normally sit in the balcony.

‘There were no lewd acts, and the conference was not shut down or suspended,’  she added.

Ms Harrop stressed their actions were far from x-rated.

'There were no lewd acts, the conference was not shut down or suspended.

'If there was anything too extreme going on, it would have been a throwing out, not a scolding. Our president has a very dry sense of humour and I think that showed.'

She said the identity of the couple and the complainant were a mystery.

'We don’t know who they were. It was an observer who complained so they could have been anybody.'

It is not known if the pair were delegates or observers.
