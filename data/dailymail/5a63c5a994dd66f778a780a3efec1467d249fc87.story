Pilots’ leaders have released a damning new dossier of testimony from flight crew admitting to falling asleep in the cockpit – sometimes simultaneously.

It includes two accounts of planes flying with both pilots asleep and another of a captain nodding off as his aircraft approached Gatwick.

The British Airline Pilots’ Association (BALPA) collated the accounts from its members following a row last week over pilot fatigue.

The dossier included: One
transatlantic long-haul pilot reported how both he and his captain were
asleep at the same time at night – and woken only by the aircraft’s 
warning alert system.

A captain also admitted falling asleep at the controls while  his colleague was having a ‘controlled rest’.

Another
pilot told how his captain nodded off low over London at a ‘critical’ 
stage of the plane’s approach to Gatwick. He was  signed off by his 
doctor for a  month for fatigue.

An
experienced captain having the ‘nodding dog’ feeling of being unable to
keep his eyes open on at least five occasions, including  during ascent
after take-off.

The 
European Parliament will vote today on new rules on flying hours that 
BALPA warns will put lives at risk by cutting UK safety standards to 
allow changes to air crew shift and rest patterns that could see pilots 
awake for up to 24 hours.

Jim
McAuslan, general secretary of BALPA, said: ‘Tiredness is already a 
major challenge for pilots who are deeply concerned that new EU rules 
will cut UK standards and lead to increased levels of tiredness.’
