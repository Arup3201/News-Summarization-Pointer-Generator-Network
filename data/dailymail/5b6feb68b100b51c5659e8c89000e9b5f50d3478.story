Head in space: General William Shelton, head of the U.S. Air Force Space Command, said adversaries are now able to challenge American advantages in space

The head of the U.S. Air Force Space Command has said that the U.S. must be prepared for enemy attacks in space.

General William Shelton said that the military has become dependent on intelligence from satellites, which has made them vulnerable.

He said potential enemies are mimicking procedures and looking for weaknesses in U.S. armor which means they are now able to challenge the nation's advantages in space.

Speaking to students at George 
Washington University he said: ‘The dependence on space has become quite
 a bit of a double-edged sword.

'Our potential adversaries have been 
going to school on us during these many years of combat operations.’

‘More concerning, as they've watched us, we've watched them develop systems to challenge our advantages in space,’ he said.

He
 said that the U.S. will be moving away from large satellite constructions
 to less complex builds with more components as it makes it harder for 
enemies to target them.

He 
highlighted the importance of satellite technique in non-combat 
situations, saying the death tolls from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and 
the Japanese tsunami in 2011 would have been even higher had satellite surveillance and communications not been available.

‘Space is the ultimate high ground 
for U.S. military,’ General Shelton said.

‘We get space-derived information to all
 sorts of users, including the military operators of our nation’s Army, 
Air Force, Navy and Marines -- those who rely on timely and accurate 
data.

‘I can't 
think of a single military operation across the full spectrum from 
humanitarian relief operations all the way to major combat operations 
that doesn't somehow depend on space for mission success,’ Shelton said,

He added that at the moment the U.S. Air Force Space Command operates
 in ‘a relatively peaceful sanctuary in space.’

Since
 the first satellite 60 years ago, U.S. space intelligence has grown into a
 $300 billion economic engine used for everything from weather 
forecasting to navigation.
