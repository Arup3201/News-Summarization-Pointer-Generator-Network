Sportsmail takes a look at 10 things we have learned from the international weekend and also the programme of matches in the Football League.

1. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain won his 18th cap when Roy Hodgson brought him on in Estonia but has still never played 90 minutes in an England shirt.

That has to change at some time because the Arsenal winger’s ability to run at people is becoming more and more valuable at international level.

He changed the game at Wembley in the second half against San Marino, and in the 29 minutes he played in Tallinn he created three chances for team mates – more than anybody except Jack Wilshere (five) and Leighton Baines (three) managed in the entire game.

2. Even Lionel Messi can muck up from the penalty spot when he changes his technique.

Of the 40 goals that the Argentine great had tucked away from 12 yards for Barcelona up until March this year, 27 of them went to the goalkeeper’s left.

But his miss for his country in the 2-0 friendly defeat against Brazil was the second recent failure when he has gone for the opposite side of the goal.

This one was saved by Brazil keeper Jefferson diving low to his right – and in September Messi missed altogether for Barca against Levante when he aimed for the top corner on that side.

3. Wayne Hennessey is far too good to be sat on the bench every week – but that has been his fate at club level for the last two seasons.

The 27-year-old Crystal Palace goalkeeper was brilliant for Wales against Bosnia on Friday night, making eight saves including a couple that were genuine world class.

Since a loan spell at Yeovil that was designed to get him fit after cruciate knee ligament injuries ended a year ago he’s played just one League game – Palace’s last of the season at Fulham - following his £3m January move to Selhurst Park from Wolves.

4. Radamel Falcao took a month after arriving at Manchester United to get on the score sheet for the first time with the winner against Everton.

His next goal hasn’t taken so long, though – the Colombian scored for his country in a 3-0 friendly against El Salvador in New Jersey.

Top strikers tend to get their goals in bursts, so Louis van Gaal will be keeping his fingers crossed that’s true of the man on loan from Monaco.

5. West Brom defender Gareth McAuley is another whose career has stalled at club level – he’s yet to be picked for a Premier League game since new boss Alan Irvine took over.

The 34-year-old can win headers in both boxes, though, as he proved with one of the Northern Ireland goals from an Oliver Norwood corner that put Michael O’Neill’s team top of Group F.

Irvine knows that already, though. McAuley also scored from a corner for his club against Hull in one of the two Capital One Cup matches he has started.

6. John O’Shea is best known for rugged defending but the Sunderland and former Manchester United star can play a bit as well.

The 33-year-old was the Republic’s best passer with every one of the 64 balls he played finding a team mate during the 7-0 romp over Gibraltar.

It isn’t only against the minnows of international football that O’Shea can use the ball, though. His average for Sunderland this campaign is 44 passes a game, with a near 90 per cent completion rate.

7. Dublin-born Eoin Doyle is emerging as the scoring sensation of the season with FIFTEEN already for Chesterfield in League One.

Doyle, 26, got both his side’s goals in the 3-2 defeat at leaders Bristol City and already has two more than he got all of last campaign, following his move to play for Paul Cook following a spell with Hibernian.

Martin O’Neill hasn’t got too many worries in the goal getting department following the 7-0 win over Gibraltar, but it sounds like six footer Doyle could be another to put on his radar.

8. Crewe might be bottom of the table at the moment, but the club’s reputation for finding and developing young talent shows no signs of waning.

Steve Davis’s team registered only their second win of the season against Coventry thanks to a brilliant free kick by 17-year-old midfielder George Cooper.

The Warrington-born starlet signed a three-year contract at Gresty Road in April and is rated as one of the best of the current crop of youngsters emerging through the club’s Academy.

9. The first act of new Oxford chairman Darryl Eales when he took over in July was to sack manager Gary Waddock and bring in Michael Appleton, the choice of his chief executive Mark Ashton.

Former Watford chief exec Ashton wanted the 38-year-old because they had worked together before that at West Bromwich Albion and according to Eales he ‘needed his own man’.

That relationship is coming under increasing strain with the side still in the League Two relegation zone following a 5-1 hammering at Cambridge.

Eales, who took over Oxford shortly after ending 11 years running the private equity arm of Lloyds Banking Group, has made it clear he wants the club in the promotion hunt this season.

10. Robbie Neilson is just 34 but earning a reputation in Scotland as one of the game’s bright young bosses – and the way his Hearts team won at Alloa to open a nine point gap at the top of the Scottish Championship tells you why.

Promotion rivals Rangers and Hibs have both failed to win at the Recreation Ground this season and Ally McCoist blasted the plastic surface as being ‘horrible’.

Enterprising Neilson spotted that Alloa make extra cash by renting out their stadium to the public – and so persuaded his bosses to fork out £320 to hire it for a whole day’s training on Wednesday.

Three days later they returned, with no fear of the plastic, and took three points thanks to Adam Eckersley’s 87th minute goal.
