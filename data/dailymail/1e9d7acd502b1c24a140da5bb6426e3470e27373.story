The husband of a critically ill grandmother who died after being plunged into the icy North Sea during a bungled cruise ship rescue has hit out at the justice system after he was paid less than £13,000 compensation.

Janet Richardson, 72, was tipped into the water wearing just her nightdress as crew members tried to transfer her to a lifeboat on a stretcher during the rescue.

Passengers shrieked in horror as the pensioner fought to stay afloat for up to eight minutes without a life jacket as crew tried to save her from the icy 2C waters.

She was eventually pulled to safety using a long pole but died in hospital three weeks later from complications.

Now widower George, 82, has condemned the justice system after he was paid just £12,980 plus £7,000 other payments for the tragedy.

And he says he has never received an apology from the cruise operators for the catastophe which was a ‘significant contributory factor' in the death of his wife.

Mr Richardson, a retired farmer, said: ‘It’s a disgrace I have never received any apology. 

'The whole so-called rescue was a fiasco. 

'They should never have used a lifeboat in those conditions, instead they should have used a helicopter, even experts agree.

‘And then not to tether the boats together in those seas was simply ridiculous. I just can’t believe they didn’t take simple precautions.’

Mr Richardson, of Penrith, who was married to Janet for 30 years, said: ‘I received less than £20,000 in total because my wife had pre-existing health problems but the trauma of being plunged into icy water definitely hastened her death.

‘Justice has not been served. The penalty for those that did this is tiny compared to the nightmare I have suffered.’

Mrs Richardson and her husband had been on a cruise to see the Northern Lights on board Ocean Countess when she suffered a gastro-intestinal haemorrhage in March 2011.

The liner was off the coast of Norway and the captain decided she was so ill she would need to be transferred to a hospital immediately.

Crew members strapped her to a stretcher with a blanket and tried to pass her to a team on a lifeboat which had pulled up beside the ship.

But the two boats, which were travelling side-by-side at 10 knots, were not tethered together and began to move apart at the crucial moment, plunging Mrs Richardson into the sea. 

One witness, Colin Prescott, told a later inquest: ‘I saw the stretcher hit the side of the vessel. Mrs Richardson went one way and the stretcher went the other.’

Mrs Richardson was treated in Norway before being airlifted back to the UK. Her husband kept a bedside vigil until her death on April 21.

Because Mrs Richardson suffered from cirrhosis of the liver, high blood pressure and was an insulin-dependent diabetic prior to the cruise and because she later died of natural causes the compensation payment was restricted.

The grandmother of eight was 18st and had a history of ill-health but her inquest heard that fighting for her life in freezing temperatures may have significantly contributed to her death.

The Ocean Countess was owned by Cruise and Maritime Voyages (CMV) at the time but caught fire near Greece in 2013 and has since been sold for scrap.

Joanne Berry, solicitor at Slater and Gordon, said Mr Richardson had received the maximum bereavement damages of £12,980 plus added payments.

She said: ‘The current law is not fair to families and we fully support a national campaign to review the level of bereavement damages for families in these situations.’

Chris Coates of CMV said a full and final settlement was offered to Mr Richardson by the ship’s owners and insurer’s for the Norwegian Search and Rescue Service.

He said: ‘The company maintained close contact with Mr Richardson following the incident conveying our sympathies and offering support.’
