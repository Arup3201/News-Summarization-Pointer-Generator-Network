When a loved one passes, most keep their memory alive with pictures and by visiting burial sites, but some take it one step further, by turning the remains  of a family member into a diamond.

Swiss company Algordanza has been turning human cremation ashes into  'memorial diamonds' for a decade.

The unusual keepsakes are made at a temperature between 1,600 and 2,000 degrees, and have a starting price of £2,800.

Unusual keepsake: A Swiss company turns human cremation ashes into shining diamonds

After cremation, human ashes weigh around 2.5kg and carbon can be extracted from theses remains, which is then heated and turned into graphite.

The graphite is then heated and subjected to intense sustained pressure, which creates the diamond.

Although this practice takes place in 22 countries, including England, it is still considered a novelty in many places across the world.

The company uses around 500 grams of ash to create one diamond, and the remaining ashes are returned to the family in an urn.

One woman, who opted for this form of memorial following the death her father, believes the diamond is an appropriate memento.

The woman, who wishes to be unnamed, said: 'The decision for the diamond funeral of my father at first was not easy, but it soon became clear and in fact the only acceptable way to me.

'Death is always a surprise, even if it is known to be inevitable.

'I think that my father would have liked to be left among us as a precious memory, especially as he has returned symbolically, as small jewel.'
