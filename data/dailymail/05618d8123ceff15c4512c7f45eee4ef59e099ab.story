Aberdeen chairman Stewart Milne claims the return of Rangers, Hearts and Hibernian to the SPFL Premiership cannot come soon enough.

Speaking after the Pittodrie club did a deal to wipe out their £14.5 million debt at their AGM on Monday night, Milne claimed it would be easier to attract sponsors to the flagship league with the biggest clubs there.

Aberdeen’s turnover for last season was up to £11.158m from £7.85m the previous year but they still made a small operating loss.

Aberdeen chairman Stewart Milne wants to see the return of the Scottish heavyweights to the SPFL

And, in an eyebrow-raising claim, the Dons chief insists most Aberdeen fans want a resumption of their bitter rivalry with Rangers after a period he describes as the most challenging in Scottish football history.

‘We all want to see Rangers, Hibs and Hearts back up in the top league again and hopefully that happens sooner rather than later,’ said Milne. ‘Without any question it would be easier to attract significant sponsorship back to our game with these clubs in the Premiership.

‘There’s no doubt that it makes the game an easier sell if we have all the major clubs competing in the same division.

Rangers confirmed on Monday that manager Ally McCoist had resigned from the club

‘Some fans like seeing big teams struggling, but I think the majority want to see their team going to Tynecastle, Ibrox and Easter Road again.

‘I’m sure our supporters want to see Rangers back at Pittodrie after what has been the most challenging period in Scottish football’s history in the last few years. It’s happened at a time when it’s been the most challenging time economically for the country as a whole which has put additional strain on the clubs.

‘I think there is a bit of stability in the game lately and we can be hopeful about things moving forward.’

At the recent SFA Convention in Glasgow, sports promoter Barry Hearn launched a verbal attack on the SPFL hierarchy for their failure to land blue chip sponsors.

Defending league figureheads, however, Milne said: ‘People have to put in context what Barry Hearn said recently as it is always easy for someone to fly in and make statements, then fly off again.

‘It’s a totally different thing to live with it and make things happen in a tough environment.

‘There will be pressures on in the months ahead to do whatever we can to bring more money into the game at a national level, as well as at the individual clubs. But having those big teams back in the top flight would certainly be a help towards that.’

Milne used the AGM to promise progress on a new training complex for the club. Plans for a new stadium at Loirston Loch will be also be revived.

As the Rangers future of Ally McCoist hangs in the balance, however, Milne also vowed to do his utmost to hang on to League Cup-winning manager Derek McInnes.

‘We have achieved a lot lately and the major factor in that has been the impact Derek has made since coming into the club,’ he said.

Hibernian chief executive Leeann Dempster says a deal to put the club in the black is not close

‘What happens on the pitch gives us momentum and is the driving force for everything else.

‘A lot of the groundwork for our plans was done a while back but not doing as much as a club like Aberdeen needs to be doing on the pitch makes it extremely difficult.

‘But it’s part and parcel of football that a successful manager will attract attention from elsewhere and we know we have to work hard to keep Derek here.

‘However, I think that Derek would be the first to admit that when he took on the job he was taking on a big task.

‘He wasn’t coming in to be a one or two-year wonder as he has just started something at Aberdeen.

‘We made really good progress on that journey in the last 18 months but he knows there is still a long way to go.

‘I have no reason not to believe anything other than the fact that Derek has every intention of seeing that through.

‘There are a whole new set of opportunities for everyone at the club and as a board we have to do what we can to help the manager keep making that progress to where we want to be.’
