Sunderland have agreed a deal for Argentina midfielder Ricky Alvarez that reportedly commits them to turning it into a near-£10million permanent transfer next summer.

The 26-year old's season-long loan from Inter Milan is expected to be confirmed shortly. 

The loan fee is one million euros, while sources in Milan say Sunderland have committed to paying 11million euros for him next June, provided they remain in the Barclays Premier League.

Quality: Alvarez has impressed at Inter Milan since joining in 2011, scoring 13 times for the Italian club

Permanent: Although the signing is initially a loan deal Sunderland will make it permanent if they stay up

Alvarez, who joined Inter from Velez in 2011, scored four times in 28 league appearances for the Serie A side last season.

He was part of the Argentina squad that reached the World Cup final, but played only 27 minutes during the tournament, as a substitute against Nigeria.

Inter retain an interest in Liverpool forward Fabio Borini, also a target for Sunderland, but fear they may run out of time to reach agreement on a loan move before tonight's deadline.
