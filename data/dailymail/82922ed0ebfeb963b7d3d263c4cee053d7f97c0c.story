A US Navy helicopter has crashed into the Red Sea sparking a frantic search for two missing crew members.

The MH-60S Knighthawk was carrying five people when it got into trouble while operating close to an American warship stationed in the middle Indian Ocean inlet.

While three of those recovered are said to be in a 'stable' condition, two others remain unaccounted for.

A statement from the Bahrain-based 5th Fleet said the craft went down on Sunday in the central Red Sea while operating with the destroyer USS William P. Lawrence.

It is understood that the helicopter was either trying to land or take off from the ship's deck when a part of the operation went wrong.

The vessel is one of the Navy's newer ships having only undertaken her first overseas deployment this year.

The guided missile destroyer has been stationed in the Red Sea in anticipation of any military action on Syria.

Due to heightened tensions in the 
region, the US Navy were quick to dispel any suggestion that the crash 
may have been caused by an enemy attack.

Also in the area is the US Navy's supercarrier, the USS Nimitz.Â 

The vessel, which is one of the biggest warships in the world, has given aircraft and smaller ships to the search.

A statement on the US Navy website said: 'Three personnel are accounted for and stable. Search efforts continue for two remaining personnel.

'The crash was not due to any sort of hostile activity. The incident is under investigation.'

Messages of support were left on a Facebook page set up for family members of sailors working on the USS William P. Lawrence.

One from Janette Carter Green said: 'I pray that everyone is found safe and sound. And all is well. Hurry home we miss you all very much.'

Another from Jessica McKelvey Williams read: 'Been thinking of you all nonstop since the news broke. I know you all must be tired and so ready to come home.

'Important to take care of yourselves under this tremendous stress so everyone can return safely'
