A stalker who broke into Madonna’s bedroom in London raided Guy Ritchie’s Wiltshire mansion and dressed up in his clothes the year before.

Grzegorz Matlok used a rope to clamber on to a balcony and smash his way into the singer’s £10million townhouse and rifle through her bedding earlier this year.

Yesterday, during a hearing at Southwark Crown Court, it emerged the 30-year-old, 
from Poland, had, last June, sneaked into the country estate Madonna 
used to share with ex-husband Ritchie and was caught putting on his 
clothes and trying to set other items alight.

He was arrested but not charged in the incident, according to reports.

Matlok was later deported to Poland for 
mental health treatment, but on March 12 this year flew back to 
Britain intent on seeing the star.

Matlok believed he was in an intimate
relationship with the Material Girl, having exchanged ‘special messages’ with her, Southwark Crown court heard yesterday.

Armed
with a map showing the location of her home, Matlok smashed his way in 
through a window in the early hours after using a rope to climb the wall
of one of her adjoining town houses.

Despite
a security guard being called to the disturbance, Matlok
hid in a cupboard, before roaming through her home.

The only thing the intruder took was a can of Red Bull worth £2.40 from her garage.

He was caught by Madonna’s close friend, film director Nathan Rissman, 39, who was renting the adjoining home

Mr Rissman alerted security guards 
who wrestled Matlok to the floor. Madonna, 52, and her children were all
in America at the time.

When police arrived they found a trail of Matlok’s personal items in her house.

He
claimed he was entitled to live there and told mental health staff if 
he was released he would go straight back to the property and wait for 
Madonna ‘in the pool’.

Matlok had denied burglary, claiming he had bought the can from a shop.

He
was due to face trial at Southwark Crown Court yesterday but pleaded
guilty at the last minute when it emerged the can he stole was 
French-labelled and matched one missing from a crate in the star’s 
garage.

Wearing a black T-shirt, the 
defendant sat expressionless in the dock flanked by four 
members of staff from a secure hospital where he is being held.

At
a previous hearing, Punal Chopra, prosecuting, said Matlok had told 
police he had travelled from Poland with the specific intention of 
meeting Madonna.

‘He told mental health personnel that
he is entitled to live in Madonna’s house because she sent him special 
messages,’ he said.

Matlok
was remanded in custody at a secure hospital. He is expected to be 
detained under the Mental Health Act when he is sentenced next month.
