Dog walkers have been warned about deliberate attempts to kill their animals after cocktail sausages laced with poison were found at a popular walking spot. 

A clutch of sausages stuffed with poisons were found on the Cuckoo Trail, a path running from Hampden Park to Heathfield near Hailsham.

The grim discovery comes after a spate of dog poisonings in nearby Brighton and Hove, and dog owners are now being warned by Sussex Police to be aware when they are out walking their animals. 

A man out walking his dog found a clutch of cocktail sausages with poisonous pellets inserted into them

The cocktail sausages were so densely packed with the poison that eating just one could have killed a dog. They were found hidden among grass on the trail.

Photos of the Cuckoo Trail sausages were posted on the Doggy Style pet service page.

The post said 'Walking along the Cuckoo trail in Hailsham at approximately 6pm this evening, I have found a quantity of cocktail sausages that appear to have a as of yet an unknown substance deliberately inserted into them.

'So this post is hopefully to help make other owners aware of the possible dangers.

'Thankfully I have a search dog that is able to indicate if something doesn't smell right, but please watch any dog off the lead as they were not in eye sight but easily consumed and in multiple places along the trail.

'Hopefully this is the action of some bored mis-guided youth, (which I'm sure this isn't the case!) but personally I find this premeditated, calculated with actions of someone who knows what they are doing.'

Dogs that have been poisoned may show the following symptoms; 

* Vomiting

* Diarrhoea

* Seizures

* Blood in the stool

* Lethargy

* Loss of appetite

* Bruising

* Nosebleeds

* Discoloured gums

If dogs display any of these symptoms they should be taken to a vet straight away. If possible take the packaging or sample of the poison with you. 

Do not attempt to medicate dogs yourself, or encourage them to vomit using salt water. 

If the skin or fur is damaged wash them with a mild shampoo and rinse well with water. 

Keep poisoned dogs away from other animals to avoid cross contamination.
