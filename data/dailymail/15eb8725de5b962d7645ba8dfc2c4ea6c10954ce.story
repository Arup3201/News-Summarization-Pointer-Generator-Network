A man in China has had to have his penis reattached after it was bitten off when his next-door neighbour's dog lunged at him.

The man, only known by his surname Yang, was chatting with his neighbour in Zuhai, located in southern China's Guangdong Province.

As the pair continued their conversation, the neighbour's dog, a mastiff which was chained up, suddenly lunged at Mr Yang.

It then bit him on the crotch and he was
 taken to hospital for treatment, where it was noted he was covered in 
blood and had his penis bitten off.

Later that day Mr Yang underwent surgery where it was successfully reattached.

A doctor at the hospital said: 'When he was sent in, his pants were wetted by blood and his penis as bitten off.

'On the same day Mr Yang's penis was reattached.'

The man was bitten by a mastiff-type dog, which belonged to his neighbour and was chained up at the time of the incident (file picture)

The operation was carried out by surgeon Liao Guolong, who said the procedure was a success.

He added that the patient would be able to leave hospital soon.

Mr Yang has now called the police to report the incident. However, the neighbour is said to have disappeared and he can't be contacted.
