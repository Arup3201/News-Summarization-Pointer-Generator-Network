Two collectors from California have put Schindler’s List up for auction on eBay - and are asking for bids starting at $3million.

The move to put the precious historical document - which is one of four known copies of the list - on the auction website has sparked controversy with many believing it should have been given to a museum.

The document, which is being sold by a private owner in Israel and is only available
for local pick up, is the only copy of the list ever to be sold on the open market.

Remarkable: Schindler's list contains the names of about 800 Jews that were saved by German businessman Oskar Schindler -- Scroll down for the complete list

Calling the document ‘a piece of history that has inspired many,’ the listing
by auction promoters Eric Garvin and Gary Zimet guarantees the list’s authenticity – it was sourced 
from Itzhak Stern, Schindler’s accountant played by Ben Kingsley in the 
award-winning film.

The document can only be collected in Israel 'for security' and to give the
winning bidder the opportunity to personally inspect it, Garvin told MailOnline

Garvin and Zimet are collectors from California with a history of headline-grabbing auctions through their company Auction Cause and are hoping for the document to sell for millions beyond the reserve price.

The two chose ‘the 
world’s marketplace’ because there are billionaires and
wealthy celebrities using the site. Garvin told the New York Post. The two collectors hope to earn at least $5 million
 from when the auction ends after 10 days, he added.

‘Using
 eBay offers the widest audience and the most opportunity to bid, as 
opposed to a traditional auction house,’ Garvin added in comments to 
MailOnline.

The other three known
 copies are in museums – with two in Israel and one in the United States
 Holocaust Museum – and that is where many believe this copy should also
 go.

‘Donate it to a museum,’ said one Twitter user. ‘Surely this should be donated to a museum,’ said another, echoing the sentiments of several people across the internet.

Several others expressed unhappiness with the auction, one person even tweeted ‘if you’re still wondering about the world you live in… Schindler’s list is being sold on e-bay [SIC]. Say no more.’

All bidders must be pre-qualified, with the winner to pay a $10,000 deposit via PayPal and work out how to send the rest offline, according to the listing.

Explaining that he understands why people believe the list belongs on display in a museum instead of for sale online, Garvin said that many people with collections of ‘fantastic items’ choose to share those items with a greater audience.

‘It would not surprise me if it ends up in a museum… I think that would be fantastic,’ said Garvin.

The list originated from German 
Industrialist Oskar Schindler. During World War II, Schindler made it 
his mission to keep his Jewish employees from oppression and death at 
the hands of the Nazis.

Schindler even bribed officials with cash and lavish gifts to keep them away.

Over six million Jews were persecuted, tortured and murdered at concentration camps across Europe as part of the 'Final Solution' by the Nazi regime by the end of World War II, according to the United States Memorial Holocaust Museum, with victims included Gypsies, the disabled, Poles, Russians and others. The dead ranged in age from babies to the elderly.

His
 efforts were adopted into both a book and movie, the latter of which 
starred Liam Neeson and won seven Academy Awards, including best picture
 and a best actor nod for Neeson.

Previous auctions staged by Auction Cause include a date with Scarlett Johansson – the
 $19 million reserve was not met, a selling of the Harry Reid/Rush 
Limbaugh letter which fetched $2.1 million and a $200,000 David and 
Victoria Beckham cocktail reception.
