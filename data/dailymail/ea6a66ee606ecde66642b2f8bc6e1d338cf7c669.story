Shoppers have chosen John Lewis as their favourite retailer and Amazon as the UK’s best online store in a major consumer survey.

Waitrose was chosen as the top food retailer, followed by Ocado and Asda, pushing out budget chains Aldi and Lidl.

Sainsbury’s was voted favourite fashion retailer, Ikea was named best furniture store and Nike won the award for best in-store experience.

Top of the shops: John Lewis beat competitors in three categories of a consumer poll of 6,000 people

John Lewis also won top spot in the customer service category and was favourite home retailer both in-store and online in the poll by Conlumino.

The retail analysts expressed ‘slight surprise’ at Amazon’s success after criticism of the web giant’s efforts to minimise tax payments in the UK.

However, Conlumino said it had become something of a cliche to find John Lewis topping polls of the UK’s favourite shops. 

The absence of discount grocers from the top three was ‘notable’.

Commercial director Stephen Ward said they scored well on prices but not in other areas. The firm surveyed 6,049 consumers from May to July.

Mr Ward added: 'This more constrained environment is one that could have worked against Waitrose, but instead the company is motoring in terms of growth and in terms of satisfying consumers. 

'Discounters are more one dimensional. It’s easy to like their low prices but it’s more difficult to fall in love with them as firms.'

HMV won the title of favourite entertainment retailer after a revival in sales which had seen the company post solid growth.
