Out on the pitches at Chelsea’s training centre in Surrey most mornings, some of the old boys are looking after the future of the club.

Andy Myers, Jon Harley, Jody Morris, Eddie Newton and Tore Andre Flo are among the former players employed in various coaching roles by Chelsea’s head of youth development Neil Bath.

In a couple of years’ time, assuming John Terry winds down his playing career at the highest level, Chelsea will need a strategy for another player they consider to be one of their own.

John Terry has been Mr Chelsea since signing his first professional contract with the club in 1997

There are lessons to be learned following the botched handling of Frank Lampard’s last summer after 13 years and 211 goals as a Chelsea player.

‘I didn’t even get to say goodbye to the fans,’ he complained in an interview last weekend. He has made it clear how much that small gesture would have meant to him.

In the great debate about Lampard’s perceived treachery for joining Manchester City, take a moment to think about him attending the funeral of former Chelsea physio George Price on Monday.

Lampard had to ask Manuel Pellegrini for permission to travel south to be at the church service for a man hugely respected by Chelsea players and staff, past and present.

Alongside him was the captain Terry, one of Chelsea’s many representatives after he had taken a coaching session with the Under 15s at Cobham in the morning.

At some point there will be a void in Terry’s life at Chelsea and it is important for the club to make sure he has a meaningful and responsible role when that moment arrives.

Slowly his PR is improving, taking baby steps to repair the damage caused by the FA’s decision to fine him £220,000 and ban him for four games after he racially insulted Anton Ferdinand.

Terry has always protested his innocence and Chelsea backed him all the way in both Magistrates Court and the FA hearing.

Terry, for all the problems over the years, remains the soul of the club. He is a blue blood.

One of the biggest issues to confront is the super-salaries of the top players and persuading them to take a massive drop in income as part of a continuity package.

Terry probably earns somewhere in the region of £7.5million as a Chelsea player, but he would be a paid a fraction of that if he was on the first-team coaching staff.

This is an area for Chelsea to consider, to find a way of bridging the salary gap and employing him in various areas of the club to make it appealing.

The transition from player to manager is rarely smooth, but Terry has designs on succeeding Jose Mourinho at Stamford Bridge at some point in the future.

His next playing contract, which will take him beyond his 35th birthday, is a ‘formality’ according to Mourinho.

Lampard was another long-serving player who had a special place in the hearts of the Chelsea faithful

Beyond that, it is time for Chelsea to consider what is next because they simply cannot afford to let Terry leave Stamford Bridge through the back door.

There are lessons to be learned from Liverpool, where their failure to make plans for Steven Gerrard’s future beyond his playing days has cost them.

Most people working within the game believe this to be a mistake.

Two years previously they lost another core member of that Liverpool team when they allowed Jamie Carragher to retire without thinking the consequences through.

When Gerrard leaves for LA Galaxy in the summer, there is a possibility that Liverpool will field a team under Brendan Rodgers next season without a local boy in dressing room.

Upstairs there are traces of the old boot room mentality, with Kenny Dalglish an ambassador of the club, but sadly the role appears to have limited responsibilities.

At Manchester United, where the influence of former players has always played a large part in the club’s thinking, they always try to do the right thing.

Ryan Giggs moved seamlessly on to the coaching staff when Sir Alex Ferguson retired and he is an important member of Louis van Gaal's technical set-up at Old Trafford.

Others have not been forgotten, with Brian McClair (director of youth academy), Bryan Robson (global ambassador) and Sir Bobby Charlton (United director) playing significant roles.

They are there to ensure continuity, to make sure that the United legend lives on and to impress the culture of the club on staff and players who have never experience life at United.

It is 10 years since Mourinho, with help from Lampard and Terry, started picking up regular silverware

One day, probably long after his playing career has ended, Terry will accept that he tested Roman Abramovich to the limit over the various scrapes he has been in over the years.

What cannot be ignored is his contribution to the club on the field.

Last weekend, when he took to the field for Chelsea’s Barclays Premier League clash with Newcastle, he drew level with Lampard with his 648th appearance.

Only Peter Bonetti (729) and Ron Harris (795), both sourced from the club’s youth team in the Sixties, are ahead of him now.

At 34, Terry remains the last player to successfully graduate form Chelsea’s academy to become an established first-team player.

Since 1997, when he signed his first professional contract at Stamford Bridge, no-one has rivalled him.

With Terry around the place, changing that could be a priority.
