The tower containing Big Ben should be renamed the Elizabeth Tower in honour of the Queen, senior MPs will say today. 

They are calling on Parliament’s authorities to recognise the monarch’s 60 years on the throne by mirroring a tribute paid to Queen Victoria.

In 1860, the west tower of the Palace of Westminster, originally called The King’s Tower, was renamed the Victoria Tower to commemorate her long reign.

Big Ben is the nickname for the great bell of the clock at the eastern end of the palace, but it is also generally extended to refer to the tower as well.

Now a cross-party group of MPs led by Foreign Office aide Tobias Ellwood is calling for the tower to be renamed the Elizabeth Tower in June to mark the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee.

His campaign has the support of Cabinet ministers, including Commons Leader Sir George Young, as well as senior figures in the two other main parties. They want the House of Commons Commission, the august body which runs the Commons, to approve the name change.

Mr Ellwood said: ‘I can’t think of a greater tribute for Parliament to bestow on Her Majesty than the naming of such a landmark as the Clock Tower. If we get the support I hope we will, I would like to see a formal announcement or a ceremony taking place on June 2.’

Former Labour foreign secretary and Lord Chancellor Jack Straw said: ‘I think it is a very fitting tribute to a monarch who has served the country so well.’

Labour’s shadow defence secretary Jim Murphy said: ‘The Queen and the Clock Tower are known throughout the world. It would be brilliant if we could celebrate 60 years of service with a permanent monument to Her Majesty’s dedication and grace.’

Today Conservative MP Mr Ellwood will table a Commons motion calling on the Commission to take forward the proposals.

It says that of the 41 monarchs who have reigned England and the UK since William the Conqueror, only Victoria and the present Queen have marked a Diamond Jubilee.

The Queen and Prince Philip will take part in a glittering carriage procession through Westminster at the end of the four-day bank holiday weekend celebrating the Diamond Jubilee, Buckingham Palace announced yesterday.

They will travel in the 1902 State Landau along a route lined by thousands of well-wishers before acknowledging the crowds from the balcony at the palace. Accompanying them in other carriages will be the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall and Prince Harry.

The spectacle on June 5 will conclude celebrations for the Queen’s 60-year reign, which include a Thames Diamond Jubilee Pageant and a concert with acts including Paul McCartney, Elton John and Stevie Wonder.
