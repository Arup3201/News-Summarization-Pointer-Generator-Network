Thousands of barmy Brits took to the beaches on Boxing Dayy for the balmiest Boxing Day for 28 years. Temperatures around the country were up in the teens with Fyvie Castle in Scotland reaching 15.5C in 1983.

And the unseasonably mild weather continued today, with the average temperature hovering around 10C and 12C across the country.

The record temperature for December 26 is 16C in Haddington, East Lothian, and the next highest 15.5C in Raunds, Northamptonshire.

But yesterday, according to the Met Office, across most of the country the temperatures never fell below 8C or 9C.

Forecaster George Goodfellow said: 'The 
only places where it got higher were in the fells of Northern Ireland 
and on high ground. It has been unseasonably warm both on Christmas Day 
and Boxing Day.'

The coldest urban area in the UK is believed to have been Aberdeen, where the mercury fell to a hardly chilly 8.5C.

The heat will remain on until the weekend when a north east wind is expected to blow in with a chill factor.

Mr Goodfellow said: 'We're expecting more unsettled weather come on New Year's Eve and parts of the country will get some rain.'

Charlie Powell, of the Met Office, said the weather was well above average compared to last year, and made a stark contrast to the chills of December 2010.

'Last year the country had the coldest December on record, since we started recording the temperatures in 1910.

'In Scotland temperatures fell to -20C in some places, it was exceptionally cold, so this year has been markedly different.'

Mr Powell said tomorrow would bring a
strong wind, with strong gales possibly reaching 80 miles per hour in central 
and western Scotland.

But he said the mild weather would continue with only blustery showers in the west of England, and the temperature dropping to a tolerable 7C to 9C.

The south and east of England should get away with a largely dry day.

By Thursday and Friday he said showers would continue to pepper the day, but the temperature was predicted to only drop to about 6C at its lowest, with some showers gathering to be a persistent rain.

Among the swimmers braving the Boxing Day water were those taking a 
dip in fancy dress at events in Tenby and Pembrey in west Wales and 
Seaburn Beach near Sunderland.

But the weather wasn't so good in 
Shetland where around 500 homes are still without power after hurricane 
force winds hit the islands on Christmas Day.

At the peak of the problems, Scottish 
Hydro Electric Power Distribution said there were 5,500 homes without 
electricity as gusts of more than 100mph were recorded on the islands 
yesterday.

The power 
company said it has drafted in engineers from the mainland who are 
continuing to work to restore supplies to the remaining homes.

Hundreds of people in fancy dress also took a plunge at Pembrey Park, west Wales, for this year's Walrus Dip

Company spokeswoman Samantha O'Connor 
said: 'There are around 500 still without power, but most of them are 
due to the same issue and we hope to have that repaired by 11pm.

'Fifty homes will definitely not have 
power restored tonight because of an overhead network problem but we 
have contacted all of those affected by this to keep them updated.

'We would like to apologise to all of those affected by the interruption to the supplies in Shetland.'

The company said engineers will work 
until 11pm today and resume early tomorrow morning to restore power to 
the remaining properties.

Mainland Scotland also experienced high winds with gusts of 80mph-90mph yesterday.

The
high winds also caused difficulties for a coastguard helicopter as it 
evacuated a female patient from the island of Yell to the main island of
Shetland at around 2.30pm yesterday.

The helicopter landed at Sumburgh Airport and the patient was transferred to hospital in Lerwick by ambulance.

Shetland Coastguard said the winds were hurricane force yesterday.

Forecasters said strong winds might return mid-week.

Daniel
Adamson, a forecaster with MeteoGroup, said: 'On Wednesday it looks as 
if we could see gusts as strong as between 70mph and 80mph, mostly in 
exposed places.'
