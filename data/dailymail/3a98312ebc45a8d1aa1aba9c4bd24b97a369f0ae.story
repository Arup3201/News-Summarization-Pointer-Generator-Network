Ashley Barnes says that he has laughed off allegations from Jose Mourinho that he was guilty of a 'criminal tackle' on Nemanja Matic when Burnley drew at Chelsea last month.

Barnes' challenge was branded 'criminal' by Mourinho and Matic's retaliation saw him receive a red card during last month's 1-1 draw while the Burnley player was unpunished.

It thrust Barnes and his club into the national spotlight and speaking about the incident for the first time to Burnley's programme for their match against Manchester City on Saturday, the 25-year-old striker explained how he dealt with the furore.

The Burnley striker said: 'You're always going to get people who come out of the woodwork and voice their opinion. There were lots of comments made that it was a 'criminal tackle' and that it was disgusting but you just have to laugh it off really.

'Obviously I've not meant it. I give my all for the team but I'm an honest player. As I've gone to pass the ball he's come to try and screen in front of the strikers. I've took a heavy touch and as I've gone to pass to Jonesy (Dave Jones) I've caught him on the shin with the follow through of the pass.

'It wasn't intentional, of course. I would never go out on a football pitch to try and hurt an opponent. But there were so many different angles and it got picked out and scrutinised to the nth degree but you just have to get on with it.

'I don't really take anything from it. All I can do is apologise that I've caught him in that manner. As you can see nobody in the ground reacted and the next minute he came and pushed me over.

Barnes said he was unaware at the time he had hurt the Serbian international:

'Obviously I wouldn't have been happy if he had caught me there but as I say I've not meant it and I didn't know that I'd hurt him because it was just my momentum that took me that way.

'You're always going to get something like that in your life and I think that's one for me, but I like to think I deal with these things quite well.'
