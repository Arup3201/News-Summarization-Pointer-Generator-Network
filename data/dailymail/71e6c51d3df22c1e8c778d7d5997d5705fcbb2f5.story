The most open and fascinating England selection in years will see three potential debutants named in the squad for next week’s first Test against Sri Lanka as the new panel herald widespread changes.

Chris Jordan, Moeen Ali and Sam Robson are all set to feature when national selector James Whitaker reveals his hand, with the probability of a return for a fast bowler seemingly long since jettisoned in Liam Plunkett.

An experienced spine of Alastair Cook, Ian Bell, Matt Prior, who looks set to edge out Jos Buttler, Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson will be joined by an eclectic mix of new and old faces charged with bringing the good times back.

Accumulator: Australian-born batsman Sam Robson is tipped to open for England with Alastair Cook

The acrimonious end to Tuesday’s 
decisive one-day international means there will be plenty of spice when 
the sides meet again at Lord’s but the central figure in the ‘Mankading’
 drama in Jos Buttler looks set to miss out.

England
 performed an about-turn on their belief that Buttler was not yet ready 
for Test cricket when the dust settled on his world-class one-day 
century at Lord’s but they will prefer Prior as long as there is no 
reaction to his chronic achilles problem from his first four-day match 
of the season with the gloves.

Yet
 there will be plenty of interest in the new faces, with Jordan sure to 
feature after his impressive one-day displays, Moeen likely to get the 
nod as a spinning all-rounder and Robson the choice as Cook’s opening 
partner. 

The only concern 
about the Australian-born Robson, who is averaging 51 for Middlesex this
 season after five centuries for the Lions last winter, is that he is an
 accumulator and may make for a one-paced partnership with the captain.

Taking his chance: Moeen Ali is set to be called up as a spinning all-rounder

Sacked batsman Kevin Pietersen jokingly made himself available for the first Test, tweeting: ‘England selectors meeting today... I’m ready to go! Fancy Lords next week... I’m a number 4 batter & bowl off spin. #KPforLords’

Yet
 it is a concern that the selectors had appeared to have ignored on Wednesday
night when they spurned the option of restoring Joe Root to the opening 
berth he vacated during the ill-fated winter and making room in the 
middle order for a highly-talented but controversial figure in Samit 
Patel.

There is no disputing
 Patel’s ability, which he has again showed by scoring 682 runs for Notts in the LV= County Championship Division One so far this season, more than any other batsman,
 but his failure to reach the required levels of physical fitness have 
held him back.

Patel was 
left out on fitness grounds as recently as the World Twenty20 tournament
 in Bangladesh but that was under different management and it will be 
intriguing to see moving forward whether the elevation of his county 
coach in Mick Newell to the selection panel will change his fortunes 
now. On Wednesday it seemed that Patel had missed out but he remains very 
much on England’s radar.

Plunkett
 made the last of his nine Test appearances seven years ago but he has 
finally, at 29, fulfilled the potential that Duncan Fletcher saw in him 
and has been bowling rapidly to considerable effect for Yorkshire this 
season.

On a great run: Notts all-rounder Samit Patel (front) is the leading scorer in Division One this season

Cook (captain), Robson, Bell, Root, Ballance, Moeen, 
Prior (keeper), Stokes, Broad, Jordan, Anderson, Plunkett.

England want fast 
pitches with bounce to take on both Sri Lanka and India this season and 
Plunkett looks the best bet to back up the certain selections in 
Anderson, Broad and Jordan as either 12th man at Lord’s or an 
alternative to Ben Stokes should the Durham all-rounder be deemed not 
quite fit enough yet.

Gary 
Ballance, who has looked the part in international cricket without yet 
recording a big score, is the hot favourite for a middle order place 
ahead of Eoin Morgan even though there are concerns about his ability 
against spin.

England would 
love to find a way to get Morgan into their Test team, not least because
 of his leadership ability, and the Irishman had the carrot of inclusion
 dangled in front of him when he was encouraged to abandon the IPL.

Yet
 Morgan has not yet put the first-class runs on the board that so many 
other challengers have and looked both short of form and out of sorts in
 the one-day series that ended in a 3-2 series defeat at Edgbaston.
