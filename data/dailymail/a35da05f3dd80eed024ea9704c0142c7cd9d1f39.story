She may be an A-list actress with a superstar husband and millions in the bank, but Gwyneth Paltrow maintains that her Christmas is just your average family get-together.

The 41-year-old mother-of-two has shared her family's festive plans with FEMAIL and they include plenty of mulled wine, pecan pie and personalised gifts.

Speaking about her Christmas Day rituals, she said: 'Our
 Christmas rituals are pretty much the same every year; it’s basically 
trying to keep the children in bed until at least 7am!

'Father Christmas 
always leaves a stocking at the end of their bed, which is great because
 then they wake up and they have lots of little bits to unwrap. Then 
they wake us up and they just go to town on the present opening.'

Gwyneth, who is famed for her culinary skills and healthy approach to cooking, will be spending ample time in the kitchen this year.

'I do a 
lot of the cooking before Christmas but then I usually spend a lot of 
Christmas cooking too. All the smells, all of the mulled wine, all of 
the trimmings for the turkey. We like to have all the family around. A 
very traditional Christmas,' she said.

The star, who is the ambassadress of the BOSS Jour Pour Femme fragrance, revealed what she will be cooking up a storm for husband, Chris Martin, and children, Apple and Moses.

She said: Christmas dinner is very traditional – turkey, stuffing, gravy, sweet potatoes, pumpkin pie, pecan pie.

'My kids are very involved in the kitchen
 with me, especially my son. He loves to cook and he’s very engaged when
 we do it – he has a lot of patience for it, it’s very cute. He helps me
 measure and he cracks eggs perfectly, he’s very good.'

Self-proclaimed 'planner' Gwyneth says she begins her Christmas shopping at least 2 months before because she likes to get things personalised.

'I think it’s really nice that when someone opens a present and it has something personal. Last year I gave everyone these beautiful handmade cutting boards, everyone in the family’s name was engraved on one side.

'I’ve done ceramic plates, jewellery with initials. It takes it from being a normal present to being something that’s actually really special and requires a lot of thought and planning,' she said.

The Iron Man 3 star revealed that her husband, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin, is the most difficult family member to shop for but she loves searching for the perfect gift.

'I have a master list of presents and people that I need to get presents for – work presents, kid presents, godchildren, friends.

'I start thinking about it a few months in advance and then I see on this master list what I got them last year and the year before.

'I also send Christmas cards, so it takes some preparation but I think it’s such a nice, warm time of year, and it’s so nice to give gifts. I really enjoy it.'

Speaking about her fondest Christmas memory, Gwyneth reminisced: 'I remember being probably about four years old and coming down and my presents were so tall, they were taller than I was.

'It was this incredible moment where Santa Claus had brought me all of these presents and it was the most astounding thing to have a mountain of presents that was taller than myself.'

Gwyneth, who regularly tops best dressed lists, also shared her festive fashion and beauty tips.

'I always feel like I end up wearing something black. I have a number of black jumpsuits that are always very easy because then you don’t have to think about much else.

'I always think it’s a good idea to have a red lip at Christmas but I’m not very good at doing that so I usually just end up looking very natural,' she said.
