A new documentary about childhood obesity in the United States is set to lift the lid on the struggles that the country's increasing number of overweight youngsters face on a daily basis, from dealing with bullies to battling against life-threatening health problems. 

Bite Size, which is due to be released via video streaming service VOD on March 10, chronicles the stories of four obese kids as they try to work their way towards a healthier goal weight by 'learning how to be active and stay happy'.

'Bite Size showcases the stories of four inspiring kids from diverse backgrounds who are fighting for their health one day at a time,' the film's description explains. 'Proving that it’s not just about the number on a scale, what really matters is learning what keeps you active and makes you happy.'

According to the American Heart Association, 'one in three American kids is overweight', with more and more children being diagnosed as obese each and every day - a health crisis which the producers of Bite Size want to highlight.

In a newly-released trailer for the documentary, viewers are introduced to its four stars - Keanna, 13, Moy, 11, Emily 13, and Davion, 12, all of whom have been diagnosed as clinically obese.

Throughout the trailer, each of children shares their views on their weight, detail how they are going about getting down to a healthier size - and what negative impact their obesity has had on their lifestyle. 

'For me to be a big person, I can run pretty fast,' Davion, who suffers from diabetes as a result of his weight, tells the camera. 

'I'm football material, but my legs will go out on me sometimes,' he adds, as a clip of him falling to his knees while at football tryouts is played. 'I want my diabetes to go away, so that I can do whatever everybody else can do.'

Try and try again: Davion is incredibly determined and insists that he will keep fighting to achieve his goals - particularly when it comes to football

Targeted: The football fan admits to being picked on by bullies, who make fun of his weight

Davion goes on to reveal that his obesity has made him a target for bullies at his school, many of whom seem content to throw both verbal and physical abuse his way at any available opportunity.

'They just hate me because of who I am,' he adds. 'They just say: "Oh, he's fat."'

But despite the abuse and torment that Davion faces, he is determined to overcome any and all obstacles put in his way - particularly when it comes to his goal of joining his school's football team. 

'If I can't do it, I'm still going to try,' he insists to the camera, while trying to complete the same tackle again and again.

Keanna, 13, is also on a mission to lose weight through exercise, and has taken up dance in the hopes that it will help her to live a healthier lifestyle. 

She admits that she has an unhealthy relationship with food, explaining that she 'eats rapidly and eats everything', suggesting that she wants not only to become more active, but to overcome her bad eating habits.

'Keanna and her friends want to be slim and get the Beyonce body,' a friend tells the camera. 'They all love to dance. So maybe that's the first step.' 

But while Keanna has found her passion - and a goal that will ensure she stays motivated to keep battling towards a healthier goal weight - 11-year-old Moy has yet to find that same passion that will get him off the couch and see him leading a more active lifestyle.

'You're eating your life away,' Moy's father is seen telling the youngster. 'You're a couch potato.'

Moy's main interest in life is his computer, which he uses to create and edit his own movies - a hobby which unfortunately sees him spending most of his time  sitting down inside.

'I love the computer,' he explains to the camera. 'Making movies is really fun.'

But Moy admits that his obesity is often the subject of cruel taunts from his fellow students at school, and even confesses that he has come close to lashing out physically at the people who continue to make fun of his size.

'I almost get in a fight because people keep making fun of me,' he says. 

Thankfully, he comes to the realization - with the help of his father - that his love of computers can also be used to help him become more active and, in turn, reach a healthier size.

Towards the end of the trailer, Moy is seen using a games console-based fitness game, which encourages him to get up on his feet and get moving - all from the comfort of his living room. 

Emily, the documentary's fourth star, has already tackled the initial hurdles when it comes to implementing a healthier lifestyle, having already spent a length of time at 'weight loss school', which she describes as being 'like The Biggest Loser for kids'.

But while she and her parents have had the benefit of expert assistance - and have already seen incredible results in terms of Emily's weight loss - the 13-year-old confesses that she feels almost more pressured to keep her weight down, than she did to lose it in the first place.

Healthy and happy: The 13 year old insists that being healthy is not necessarily just about weight loss, but is rather about 'learning what keeps you active - and what makes you happy'

'People bet on who is going to gain some of the weight back,' she said of her fellow weight loss school students. 'I was a big target for who was going to fail.'

Without the strict guidance of her weight loss teachers, Emily admits that she begins to put on weight, almost immediately after returning home - despite making every effort to maintain a healthy diet.

'I am a never-ending trash can,' she tells the camera, before breaking down, and adding: 'And to come back and gain some of the weight back...'

But, of all the children, Emily seems to have the best understanding about what being healthy really means.

'It's not about "weight loss",' she says. 'It's just about learning what keeps you active - and what makes you happy.'
