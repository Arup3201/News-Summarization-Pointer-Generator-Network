Prince Harry has taken his girlfriend Cressida Bonas on a skiing trip to Kazakhstan but the couple are staying at a resort owned by a wealthy oligarch with ties to the dictatorship's political elite.

The couple, who are experienced skiers, flew by government helicopter to the exclusive resort of Shymbulak in the former Soviet state for a ‘private holiday’.

However, the Shymbulak resort is part-owned by Serzhan Zhumashov, whose construction firm is the leading builder of luxury property in Kazakhstan.

The oligarch has admitted that he has partly prospered thanks to his political connections - saying that he operates in the 'grey area' between the country's private and public sectors.

He has also used his estimated 
£130million wealth to build links with the West - including opening a 
Kazakh offshoot of a leading English public school.

Kazakhstan has been led by president Nursultan Nazarbayev - an autocratic leader who has suppressed political opposition - ever since becoming independent from the USSR in 1991.

Mr Nazarbayev has been accused of human rights abuses including censorship and even torture - but he controversially hired Tony Blair as an adviser on a contract reportedly worth £8million.

Prince Harry and Miss Bonas, who first 
met in summer 2012, reportedly arrived by helicopter to stay a luxury
 chalet in the mountains above the city of Almaty.

During their stay they were seen 
posing for photographs with other skiers.

It was on a previous ski 
holiday in the Swiss resort of Verbier that Prince Harry, 29, and Miss 
Bonas, 25, were first spotted openly embracing. 

Although
 enthusiasts might not choose it as the go-to place to hit the slopes, 
Kazakhstan has a cold winter which ensures it has powdery snow until 
late in the season.

The 
holiday will fuel further speculation that Prince Harry and Miss Bonas, a
 dance graduate who works in theatre marketing, are becoming more 
serious about each other.

Earlier this month, the couple enjoyed a rare public outing together at Twickenham to watch England defeat Wales at rugby.

Other
 dates include trips to high street burger chain Byron and the Cirque du
 Soleil production of Quidam at the Royal Albert Hall.

In
 a step that proves how their relationship has matured, Miss Bonas has 
been invited to co-host a formal dinner with Harry in the Queen’s rooms 
at St James’s Palace.

The prince is to host a private dinner party to honour the war heroes he trekked to the South Pole with before Christmas.

The Shymbulak resort – set among dramatic peaks that separate China from the Russian steppes – has only one main slope.

It
 is frequented by wealthy Russians, many of whom are in the country as 
part of the oil and gas trade.

Skiing is too expensive for most Kazakhs,
 many of whom still work in heavy industry that is the legacy of the 
Soviet system.

The couple 
may have chosen their skiing destination with help from Prince Andrew – 
who developed strong links with the former Soviet state in his capacity 
as Britain’s special trade representative.

Andrew
 sold his home in Ascot to a tycoon from Kazakhstan and is a frequent 
guest of the country’s president Nursultan Nazarbayev with whom he goes
 goose-hunting.

Display of affection: It was on their ski holiday to the resort of Verbier that they were spotted openly embracing for the first time

Relationship: The holiday will fuel further speculation that Prince Harry and Miss Bonas, a dance graduate who works in theatre marketing, are becoming more serious about each other

Miss Bonas – the granddaughter of the 6th Earl Howe, whose title dates back to 1788 – boarded at £30,000-a-year Stowe School in Buckingham and is the daughter of Old Harrovian Jeffrey Bonas.

Her mother Lady Mary Gaye has had an unconventional lovelife.

Her five children are by three of her four husbands, all divorced.

Her fourth husband, financier Christopher Shaw, died in January aged 76. Cressida comforted her mother at his funeral, but Prince Harry was not seen in attendance.

Harry was previously involved in a turbulent seven-year relationship with Zimbabwe-born Chelsy Davy until 2011.

A spokesman for the Prince declined to comment, saying any trip would have been a ‘private holiday’. But royal sources confirmed the couple had been away together.

But sources close to the prince said the trip had been organised by a friend and he and Cressida had 'tagged along'.
