For fitness fanatics, they could reveal unknown routes.

But for the rest of us, these beautiful maps reveal the paths trodden by joggers around the world's biggest cities.

They were created using the publicly available 'virtual tracks' left by users of the popular Runkeeper app.

New York for runners: These maps were created from the publicly available virtual tracks of runners left by the runkeeper app.

Many popular fitness apps allow users to record their movement.

Dr Yau used the publicly available feeds or people using Runkeeper to create the maps.

The data is a complete listing or GPs co-ordinates for each runner or cyclist.

Using special software, Dr Lau was able to combine them to create these maps.

The maps were built by Dr. Nathan Yau.

'There are many exercise apps that allow you to keep track of your running, riding, and other activities,' he said.

'Record speed, time, elevation, and location from your phone, and millions of people do this, me included. '

He decided that the information was too personal, and wanted to join the individual tracks together.

'However, when we look at activity logs, whether they be our own, from our friends, or from a public timeline, the activities only appear individually.'

'What about all together? Not only is it fun to see, but it can be useful to the data collectors to plan future workouts or even city planners who make sure citizens have proper bike lanes and running paths.'

London for runners: The map reveals that the capitals parks are popular destinations, as are the paths along the Thames.

Charlotte appears to resemble an insect, with adventurous runners venturing far out of the city centre

Dr Lau says he was inspired by tunning trace maps created by Nikita Barsukov.

'I wondered what the paths looked like for others,' he said.

'A lot of people make their workouts public on a variety of services, so there's definitely accessible data.

'I use RunKeeper for cycling. I sampled from there.'

Sydney: Runners tend not to stray outside the city, but still favour seafront routes

Boston: runners again congregate around the sea and riverferont

'The maps below are what I got, mostly for American cities, but there are a few European cities in there too

'If there's one quick (and expected) takeaway, it's that people like to run by the water and in parks, probably to get away from cars and the scenery.

'In the smaller inland cities, there seem to be a few high-traffic roads with less running elsewhere.'

Miami's map reveals that seafront running is virtually the only kind of running done in the city

Paris is also dominated by its parks for runners, although some attempt the large look through the suburbs.

San Francisco's map shows runners heading for the city's sea front, although Golden Gate Park is also a popular route.
