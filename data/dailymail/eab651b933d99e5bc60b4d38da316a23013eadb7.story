It's a highly-anticipated deal that keeps his nation from teetering over the edge of the fiscal cliff - yet President Obama has not even shown up to sign the new bill into law.

Instead, Obama, who is vacationing in Hawaii, has signed the bill using an autopen, a mechanical device that copies his signature - allowing him to accept the deal after playing a round of golf.

While he's the only president in history to turn to the gadget to sign a bill into law, it is not the first time President Obama has used it.

In May 2011, he used the pen to sign the Patriot Act - extending anti-terrorism measures enacted in the wake of 9/11 - while he was 3,725 miles and six time zones away in France at a G8 meeting.

In that instance, Mr Obama was awoken at 5.45am in his hotel room in Deauville, France, so that he could review and approve the bill with only minutes to spare before the deadline passed in the U.S.

He also used the device in November 2011 while he was holding talks with Asian/Pacific leaders in Bali in Indonesia; he signed an appropriations bill to fund government departments in his absence.

The fiscal cliff bill was approved on a sunny day in Honolulu during which the president played a round of golf at a Marine Corps base in nearby Kaneohe.

In between the round of golf, working out at the local gum and dining with his wife and friends, Obama reviewed a copy of the legislation and ordered that the original be signed by autopen in D.C.

After months of wrangling, the deal was 
finally reached after Obama cut his family vacation short last week, 
returning to Washington D.C. on December 26 for the negotiations.

But after addressing the nation following the House's passage of the fiscal cliff deal, Obama jetted back to the Aloha State late on Tuesday night.

He arrived in Honolulu 
before 5am local time yesterday and immediately rejoined the First Family in their 
rented beachside vacation home in Kailua, a picturesque suburb 
on the east side of Oahu.Â 

After Obama used the autopen to sign the
 Patriot Act in 2011, critics claimed using the mechanical device to 
write his signature was unconstitutional.

Article 1, Section 7 of the 
constitution states that if a bill is passed by both the House and 
Senate, it shall be presented to the president. 'If he approve(s) he 
shall sign it,' states the Constitution.

President Barack Obama's REAL signature.....

.... and the autopen signature

Conservative critics have claimed that using the autopen for a president to write his signature is unconstitutional.

Article 1, Section 7 of the 
constitution states that if a bill is passed by both the House and 
Senate, it shall be presented to the president. 'If he approve(s) he 
shall sign it,' states the Constitution.

There is nothing in the document that suggests a reasonable facsimile affixed by an appliance will do just as well.

But in 2005, the Justice 
Department's Office of Legal Counsel deemed the use of the autopen constitution, ruling that 'the President need not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a bill to sign it'.

The autopen is often used by politicians and celebrities to duplicate signatures for letters. Obama is the first president to use the device to sign a bill into law, but Harry Truman, Thomas Jefferson and Gerald Ford are also known to have used the autopen.

There is nothing in the document that suggests a reasonable facsimile affixed by an appliance will do just as well.

But the White House sidestepped the 
constitutional requirement by citing a 2005 opinion from the Justice 
Department's Office of Legal Counsel.

It concluded that 'the President need
 not personally perform the physical act of affixing his signature to a 
bill he approves and decides to sign in order for the bill to become 
law'.

In the White House's view, it does 
not make a difference that one bill is really signed by the president 
and the other bears a look-alike signature, and it rejected calls for 
him to re-sign the Act.

The autopen has been called into question in other cases; in 2004, then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld met criticism for using an autopen to sign condolence letters to the families of fallen troops.

And in 1992 then-Vice President Dan Quayle was lambasted for using the autopen on official correspondence during an appearance on 'This Week with David Brinkley'.

Harry Truman, Thomas Jefferson and Gerald Ford are also known to have used the autopen, yet Obama is the first president to have used it to sign a bill into law.

The fiscal cliff agreement boosts taxes on the wealthiest Americans, while preserving tax cuts for most American households.

The bill, which averts a looming 
fiscal cliff that had threatened to plunge the nation back into 
recession, also extends expiring jobless benefits, prevents cuts in 
Medicare reimbursements to doctors and delays for two months billions of
 dollars in across-the-board spending cuts in defense and domestic 
programs.

The 
Republican-controlled House gave final legislative approval Tuesday 
night to a package that avoids income tax increases for most Americans 
and delays for two months billions in across-the-board spending cuts.

Minutes later, Obama appeared in the White House briefing room to praise the deal in an eight-minute speech.

'And I hope that everybody now gets at 
least a day off, I guess, or a few days off, so that people can refresh 
themselves, because we're going to have a lot of work to do in 2013,' he
 said.

The fiscal cliff deal delays by two months billions in scheduled in spending cuts. It also sets up battles between Democrats and Republicans over federal spending and debt.

The first showdowns will come over the next three months, when the government's legal ability to borrow money expires and temporary financing for federal agency budgets will lapse.

Republicans have already said, as they did in 2011, that they will demand spending cuts as a condition for extending the debt ceiling.

Obama also faces decisions over Cabinet appointments, with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner and Defense Secretary Leon Panetta expected to leave.
