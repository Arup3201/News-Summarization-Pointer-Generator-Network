The Colorado movie theater where 12 people were gunned down and another 58 wounded will reopen for business as early as the New Year.

The Century Aurora 16 has been closed since July 20 when James Holmes allegedly attacked a sold-out screening of the Dark Knight Rises in a shooting rampage that horrified the nation.

Theater executives say a survey conducted by the city of Aurora shows most residents want the 16-screen megaplex to reopen.

However, they have announced no plans for a memorial to remember the victims of the terrifying attack and city officials have removed the makeshift marker that was installed by mourners.

The company's motivations for the quick 
turn-around are likely financial -- ticket sales at the other 
theaters in town have soared since the closure.

On Friday, as the theater re-opening date was announced, victims filed two new lawsuits against the theater, alleging the company should have done more to protect spectators by hiring security guards and preventing access to back door entrances on the night of the blockbuster premier.

The lawsuits were filed by two of the men who were wounded in the shooting allegedly committed by the 24-year-old neurosciences student.

Karie Bible, a movie theater analyst with Exhibitor Relations in Los Angeles, told the Denver Post that theaters rake in cash during the fall and early winter seasons, when most Oscar contenders debut on the big screen.

Mayor Steven Hogan said on Friday that residents were overwhelmingly supportive of re-opening the theater, though the city has not shared the results of the online poll.

Ticket sales at Aurora's remaining six movie theaters slumped in the days following the shooting. However, the weekend after the tragedy, they surged 90 percent as resident turned out in droves to see movies.

Executives with Texas-based Cinemark, which owns the Century Aurora 16, said they plan to 'remodel and reconfigure' the theater.

However, at least some residents are uneasy with the speed of the re-opening.

'I would feel much better about this had I heard just ONE thing about a memorial being placed there. I don't like the fact that it seems like they are taking everything away. The built memorial is now gone, and zero talk of the theatre putting one in,' Aurora resident Peggy Jean posted on the city's Facebook page.

On Thursday, city officials removed a makeshift memorial from a vacant lot across the street from the theater, boxing up the 12 white crosses and assorted teddy bears, and shipping them to a city warehouse.

All that remains to remind passersby of the tragedy that occurred at the theater is a simple sign that reads 'Thank you for the outpouring of love and support for the victims of the 7/20 Tragedy. Always remember.'

All that remains: This sign is the only memorial to the victims of the deadly rampage that is currently standing in Aurora

The city says it is currently discussing plans for a permanent memorial. However, the theater company has not released any plans for a marker commemorating the victims.

Greg Medek, whose daughter Micayla, 23, was killed during the rampage, said the owners must do something to remember the dozen people who died.

He says a portion or theater profits should go to the families of the victims to help them cope with the lifelong trauma of the tragedy.
