Yohan Cabaye has advised Newcastle fans to lay off Alan Pardew and insists that the players are to blame for the club's early-season crisis.

Recent Newcastle matches have turned toxic with supporters at home and away calling for Pardew to be sacked while aiming a constant torrent of abuse at him from the stands.

Owner Mike Ashley has stood firm and so far not bowed to fan pressure by getting rid of Pardew, even though they are second-from-bottom and winless in the league this season.

Alan Pardew has endured a torrid time of late but Cabaye insists he is 'a good manager' who deserves time

French midfielder Cabaye moved to Paris Saint-Germain from Newcastle last January in a £20million deal

Cabaye, who played for Newcastle under Pardew for two-and-a-half years, said: 'The manager is in trouble, but he shouldn't get all the complaints because it's not only him.

'Even when I was there, the second season for me wasn't good and it was up to the players on the pitch. The manager gave us the way to play, but after that it's up to the players.

'We got the complaints two years ago because the players knew the job wasn't good from us. Now I hope it's the same. The players have to work harder to get the club higher in the league.' 

Newcastle supporters held numerous banners calling for Pardew to be sacked during the 1-0 defeat at Stoke

Cabaye was a firm fans' favourite on Tyneside and Pardew's side relied on his goals and invention

In the French midfielder's second season at Newcastle the club had a strong run in the Europa League but struggled in the league and were close to being relegated.

They finished that 2012-13 season in 16th, just two places and five points above the drop zone.

Back then, they were able to call on Cabaye in the heart of their midfield with his creativity on the ball and ability to score sensational strikes.

But now there is no obvious player who has replaced him since he left in January, making a £19million switch to Paris Saint-Germain and goals have dried up since he left. 

Cabaye refused to play against Manchester City in August 2013 as he tried to orchestrate a move to Arsenal

Despite Pardew's criticism of Cabaye, the Frenchman insists Pardew's man-management skills are brilliant

The Frenchman maintains that the only reason he wanted to move was because he felt PSG were a bigger club who could offer him Champions League football and not due to any issues with Newcastle.

He said: 'I like Pardew because he gave me confidence to play the way I did while I was there.

Magpies owner Mike Ashley reportedly told a journalist Pardew would be sacked if Newcastle lost at Stoke

'He is really close to the players and he talks a lot with them. He puts them in a good frame of mind to play well.'

Ashley has also come under fire from angry supporters who are unhappy with the way he runs their club, but Cabaye added: 'I cannot complain about the owner. He was fantastic with me and with my family.

'The fans have their reasons and I respect them, but I respect the owner as well.'
