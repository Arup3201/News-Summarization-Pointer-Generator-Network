It may have started as a humble circuit of rubber strips, but that wouldn't stop Scalextric becoming a thing of dreams.

For generations, millions of children have routinely spread themselves onto the floor for hours on end to get the best track-side view of their miniature plastic cars in action.

Now, 56 years later, the inventor's family has unveiled the first ever set - completely untouched.

Historic: Diane Francis, widow of Scalextric inventor Freddie Francis, has unveiled the vintage set 56 years later

Nostalgia: Mr Francis modelled a blue Maserati and a green Ferrari to launch the set at Harrogate Toy Fair in 1957

Freddie Francis launched the car racing kit at Harrogate Toy Fair in 1957.

It was an instant hit with dealers, and a year later he sold the brand to Lines Bros. for mass production.

But besotted by the toy, he put the first set ever made aside to one day pass on to his children or grandchildren.

The previously unopened set has been preserved in a wooden box at the Francis family home.

But when Mr Francis lay on his death bed in 1998, suffering from cancer, he told his wife Diane his dying wish was to hand the priceless plaything to their daughters, Caroline and Julia.

The plastic and rubber circuit, with this rudimentary controller, was cutting-edge technology

The original manual is completely untouched. But Mr Francis vowed to give it to his children after he died

Finally, after fifteen years, and now with two grandchildren, Mrs Francis decided this Christmas was the time to unearth the vintage box from storage to give to Callum, four, and Luke, two.

Mrs Francis, 68, from Birdham in West Sussex, said: 'My husband launched Scalextric in 1957 and kept one of the original boxes.

'It is one of the very first sets ever made and it has been kept in a wooden box which my husband built to safeguard it.

'After
 we had our two daughters Catherine and Julia, Freddie came up with the 
idea of giving them an original box set when they were older.

The kits were an instant hit. Here, Formula One driver Stirling Moss is seen playing with his very own set

'Freddie
 sadly passed away from cancer in 1998 and it was his dying wish that 
our daughters got this set - it was uppermost in his mind.

'I felt now was the right time to give my daughters the set.

'Julia and Catherine grew up playing with various Scalextric sets which they used to set up under the snooker table.

'Freddie wanted them to have it as something to remember him by.

'Opening the wooden box which contained the Scalextric set brought a lump to my throat.

Family: Mr Francis, pictured with wife Diane (top left), and daughters Caroline and Julia, always had kits for the family over the years. He vowed to give them the precious original when he died aged 78 in 1998

Love: Mr Francis attached a picture of him and his wife to his greatest invention

'Scalextric is at the heart of our family and our daughters are very proud of their father.

'Now
 they have children of their own who never got to meet their grandfather
 but thanks to this Scalextric set his memory will live on.'

Scalextric was born out of Freddie's company Minimodels which made tin plate toys and models.

Among the firm's most popular products were its clockwork racing cars called Scalex - and when Freddie added an electric motor they became Scalex-electric or Scalextric.

Grandsons Callum, four, and Luke, two, unwrapped the gift, now worth more than £1,500, this year

The toy fuelled fanatic interest in real-life cars as the manuals included information about the Grand Prix

Original sets came with pieces of interconnecting track made from rubber and two metal model racing cars.

The cars chosen for the first sets were a Ferrari 375 and a Maserati 250F - driven by big name Grand Prix rivals like Stirling Moss, Juan Fangio and Alberto Ascari.

The tracks and cars were built to a scale of 1:30 - and the cars were capable of a scale speed of 130mph.

The speed of the cars was determined by handheld controllers and to make racing more fun the sets came with 'skid patch fluid' to create on-track hazards.

A 1957 set cost five pounds, 17 shillings and six pence - the equivalent of 120 pounds in today's money.

So sought after are original sets that the Francis family's unopened Scalextric track could now be worth upwards of £1,500.
