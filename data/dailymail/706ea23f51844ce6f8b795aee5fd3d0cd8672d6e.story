An Australian local council has agreed in a crucial vote to retain a plaque dedicated to disgraced entertainer Rolf Harris - even though it's been stolen.

While other tributes to Harris have been removed around the world, the shire of Wyndham-East Kimberley in Western Australia has voted to keep the metal commemorative plaque.

But local taxpayers might have to fork out to pay for a replacement because the original, in once-pride-of-place on a stand in a park in Kununurra, was stolen several days ago.

Officials have voted against removing a commemorative plaque that was laid by Rolf Harris on a footpath 

Despite Harris being sentenced to more than five years in jail for indecently assaulting four girls in Britain between 1968 and 1986, a motion to remove the commemorative plaque from the park was defeated by five votes to four.

'I'm disappointed by the decision,' said councillor Keith Wright, who put forward the motion to take down the plaque.

'Some of the councillors argued you can't change history, and cited the example of Ned Kelly being revered as a national hero and the fact his background and record was questionable,' Mr Wright told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

'But I argued that you can't compare standards of a hundred years ago to the standards that we now adopt and are proud of in society today.'

Mr Wright said he hoped a fresh vote could be held before the council had to foot the bill for a replacement.

'I hope the council can resolve to permanently remove the plaque to save the community the expense of replacing it.'

Police have investigated the theft but it is understood no progress has been made in catching the souvenir hunters.

Earlier this month another plaque dedicated to Harris was stolen from outside the entertainer's former home in the Perth suburb of Bassendean.

The local council had voted to remove the plaque - which had already been vandalised - but before the vote could be taken the memento was stolen.

However, the council did vote to strip Harris of all honours and took down his art in public buildings.

In further acts to wipe out the memory of the convicted child molester, the City of Perth council voted to remove a commemorative plaque in the city centre while the City of Geraldton agreed not to display any of his art works.
