For years they have been unfairly regarded as the sole preserve of maiden aunts and respectable ladies of a certain vintage.

But thanks to fashionable fan the Duchess of Cambridge, among countless other celebrities, pearls are replacing diamonds as a staple of the fashion set.

Elegant pearl earrings - as worn by the former Kate Middleton on her royal tour of Australia and New Zealand - have become a wardrobe must-have - and prices are going through the roof.

So popular have they become that classic sets of the gems are being sold for huge sums by one of the world’s leading auction houses.

Bonhams believes natural pearls are now hitting record prices because of their rarity - overfishing and pollution mean the supply of new natural pearls is waning - coupled with the influence of celebrities.

Seventy-five pearls, fastened with a diamond clasp, made up the most valuable lot in the sale - a single-strand natural saltwater pearl necklace dating from circa 1910. The necklace sold to a buyer on the telephone for £194,500.

Two more pearl necklaces shone among the top five prices. A single row pearl necklace composed of 70 pearls captured the heart of one determined telephone bidder who secured the necklace for a staggering £110,500 – more than ten times its £7,000-9,000 pre-sale estimate. A three row necklace of natural saltwater pearls quadrupled estimates to sell for £92,500.

A natural pearl and diamond ring near tripled its £15,000-20,000 estimates as it sold for £47,500. The single natural saltwater pearl on an intricately engraved band, is delicately set throughout with diamonds.

It’s not just British royalty who are pearl fans. America’s First Lady Michelle Obama is often seen wearing her favourite double-stranded pearl necklace and fashion icon Sarah Jessica Parker has long been a fan of pearls.

Royal seal of approval: The Duchess of Cornwall, left, and the Queen often wears pearls - Bonhams believe natural pearls are now hitting record prices because of their rarity

She wore an eye-catching strand of pearls at the launch of her pop-up shop in New York in February and regularly accessorises her outfits with pearls.

Thanks to the Duchess of Cambridge and Sarah Jessica Parker, pearl wearers are becoming younger and championed by the fashion faces such as Rihanna and Cara Delevingne  

Other pearl fans include singer Katy Perry, Angelina Jolie and Scarlett Johansson. 

Jean Ghika, head of jewellery in the UK and Europe at Bonhams said: 'Pearls were once seen as a bit dated - perhaps the preserve of an older generation, but we’ve seen a complete change in how they are viewed.

'A younger fashion set is now completely at home wearing classic pearl earrings and you’re as likely to see them in nightclubs and premieres as you are at Ascot or the Epsom Derby.'

Bonhams says investors are increasingly snapping up rare natural pearls because of their increasing rarity.

Really good examples of natural pearl - based on size, uniform shape, lustre and blemish-free skins - do not appear on the market as often as they used to.

Miss Ghika added: 'They are a rare commodity and it is often very difficult to find good quality examples. Quite simply, the supply of natural pearls is not going to increase.

'Long-term, they will become more of a rarity and therefore even more highly prized. As a result, pearls that have some age, or were part of a historic collection, can be highly appealing to potential buyers and investors.'

The auction house has recently recorded record sales of natural pearls, including a pair of natural pearl and diamond earrings which sold for £290,500 in April - double their estimate.

Through the ages: Long-term, they will become more of a rarity and therefore even more highly-prized, said Bonhams of the gem loved by Princess Diana, left, and heiress Huguette Clark in the early 1900s

They also auctioned a single natural pearl measuring 11.5mm mounted as a ring, which sold in April for £30,000, ten times the upper estimate and a long single strand of graduated natural pearls measuring 5.5mm-8.5mm, which sold for £87,600 in April 2012, more than double the pre-sale estimate.

A rare pearl worn as one of a pair of earrings for years has just sold at auction for a world record £811,000.

It was worn as jewellery by a lady who had no idea how much it was worth and two large round pearls made up the earrings that had been given to her as a gift by her husband. He later showed them to experts who identified one of the gems as a natural pearl. 

A pearl is produced within the soft tissue of a living shelled mollusc.

Pearls that occur spontaneously in the wild - or 'natural pearls' - are rare but extremely valuable and are made up of nearly 100 per cent calcium carbonate and conchiolin.

They come in a variety of shapes but, the rounder they are, the more valuable.

Cultured pearls, however, are the result of the a piece of mantle tissue from a shell being transplanted into another shell.

The only way to differentiate between natural and cultured is via X-ray at a gem-testing laboratory - a cultured pearl will show a different structure.

Imitation pearls are made of mother-of-pearl, coral or conch shell.

£2.19m is one of most expensive pearls to be auctioned at Christie's.
