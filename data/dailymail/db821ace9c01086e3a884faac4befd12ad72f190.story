On the day that Andy Murray played his first Grand Slam match since Ivan Lendl’s exit from his coaching box it was interesting to note the presence of a former Wimbledon champion seated several rows behind the support team that remains.

Amelie Mauresmo, the winner at SW19 in 2006, braved the chill wind to spend the whole match watching him defeat Kazakhstan’s Andrey Golubev 6-1, 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 and stayed to watch the on-court interview afterwards too.

She was only yards away from Murray’s girlfriend Kim Sears and, amid all the speculation about who will be brought in to replace Lendl, you could only wonder if she might become another significant woman in his life.

According to one credible source Mauresmo and the British No 1 have been talking about the post, and while the only person who can make the choice is Murray himself, the idea of him bringing her on board in some capacity might not be totally fanciful.

Murray, who has always been prepared to think outside the tramlines, is on record as saying that he would consider a woman as his coach, which some thought might be a reference to Martina Navratilova.

Yet Mauresmo actually has experience of coaching a man. In 2010 she worked with the experienced French player Michael Llodra and she knows the pressures of being a world No 1, having also won the Australian Open.

Currently she works as France Fed Cup captain, which takes a few weeks per year, and she is also in close contact with the game through work in the French media. 

Murray has hinted that he has identified someone he would at least like to try out. Last night he was vague about his plans while suggesting that something might be in the air. ‘It’s not something that’s distracting me right now, so it’s not been a problem so far,’ he said.

He will need focus when he plays Australia’s Marinko Matosevic, the world No 66 who is not keen on his nickname of ‘Mad Dog’. He defeated German-Jamaican Dustin Brown in four sets.

Matosevic is unlikely to be as awkward a prospect as Golubev, who lived up to his reputation as a flashy groundstroker whose mix of dramatic winners off both sides, coupled with copious shanks, gives his opposition so little rhythm to play with.

After missing last year with a back injury this was Murray’s first French Open appearance since winning the Olympics, US Open and Wimbledon, which ought to make him more comfortable. There has also been back surgery to ease the problems largely associated with playing on clay.

Apart from Golubev his biggest irritation yesterday was the overhead cable camera, which kept moving while he was trying to serve. That shot caused him problems in the third set, when he was broken three times.

Otherwise it had been a highly impressive beginning and a fairly comprehensive end, although there were times when he should have been more aggressive, as Lendl always advised.

‘I was excited to be back after what happened last year,’ he said. ‘I came here a few weeks ago to practise with Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and after that I was looking forward to it even more.’
