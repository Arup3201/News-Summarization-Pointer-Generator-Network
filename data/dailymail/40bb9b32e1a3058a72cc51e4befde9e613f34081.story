Tony Blair must not be allowed to delay the release of the Chilcot report into the Iraq War, a former Labour Attorney General warned today.

Lord Morris called for ‘urgent clarification’ on whether Mr Blair, ex-PM Gordon Brown or the Cabinet Office are to blame for the delay in publication.

The former law officer in Mr Blair’s first Cabinet urged David Cameron to make a ‘firm decision’ to release the report well ahead of next year’s General Election.

Mr Brown launched the inquiry by Sir John Chilcot in June 2009, soon after becoming Prime Minister.

The inquiry last took evidence from a witness three years ago.

There is mounting speculation that the process of declassifying documents, including Mr Blair’s correspondence with President George W Bush before the war, has stalled.

Last week Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg expressed his frustration at the lengthy delays and suggested Mr Blair is to blame – a claim denied by the former prime minister’s office.

Today Lord Morris, who spent two decades on the Labour frontbench, warned there is ‘now the real danger is that the publication will run into the 2015 election’.

The British public may come to view the impact of the Iraq war 'differently', Tony Blair has claimed.

In a speech in central London, the former Prime Minister defended the use of military intervention and warned of the failure to put boots on the ground in Libya and Syria.

Mr Blair said: 'We change the regimes in Afghanistan and in Iraq, put soldiers on the ground in order to help build the country, a process which a majority of people in both countries immediately participated in, through the elections. But that proved immensely difficult and bloody.

'We change the regime in Libya through air power, we don't commit forces on the ground, again the people initially respond well.

'But now Libya is a mess and a mess that is de-stabilising everywhere around it.'

He went on: 'It does not mean that we have to repeat the enormous commitment of Iraq and Afghanistan. It may well be that in time people come to view the impact of those engagements differently. But there is no need, let alone appetite, to do that.'

Writing in the Daily Mirror, he urged Mr Cameron to commit to publication as soon as possible.

‘Who is responsible for the delay? Not Chilcot and his colleagues, who must be anxious to publish,’ Lord Morris said.

‘Two
 past Prime Ministers - Gordon Brown and Tony Blair? A cabinet office 
fighting to maintain a precedent that cabinet minutes and discussions 
between the two previous Prime Ministers should be permanently kept 
private?

‘Parliament deserves a clear statement from Mr Cameron as to the reasons for the delays.’

Cabinet Office officials insist that the declassification of the documents will be completed ‘soon’.

But only after that will inquiry chairman Sir John begin the so-called ‘Maxwellisation’ process of warning figures like Mr Blair, Gordon Brown and former Foreign Secretary Jack Straw that they face criticism over the decision to go to war.

Lord Morris added: ‘What urgently needs clarification now is where the main hold-up is.

‘Prevarication by either of the two ex-PMs? Masterly inactivity by the present Prime Minister and his Cabinet?

'Opposition by the Cabinet Office, who must have advised Gordon Brown in his statement to Parliament? Or the stringing out of the process of Maxwellisation?’

A report last week suggested that Sir John’s review may not be produced until next year, potentially making Iraq an issue in the 2015 general election campaign – something that concerns Labour leader Ed Miliband, who has sought to distance his party from the Blair years.

Mr Blair has denied knowledge of the reason for the delays, telling a journalist: ‘I don’t know anything more than you do.’

Lord Morris served as Attorney General from 1997 to 1999. He had previously served on the Labour frontbench under Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock and John Smith.

He was the Welsh Secretary in the Cabinet under Harold Wilson and James Callaghan.
