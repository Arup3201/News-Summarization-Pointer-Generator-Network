Sportsmail's Pete Jenson reveals all

Ander Herrera has completed his £29million move to Manchester United after agreeing to pay his buyout clause at Athletic Bilbao.

The Liga club had rejected a bid from Louis van Gaal's side, but after the central midfielder underwent a medical at Carrington on Wednesday, a move seemed inevitable.

Luke Shaw is also due to have a medical on Thursday night ahead of his £34m switch to Old Trafford from Southampton.

And the 24-year-old's switch has now been confirmed, making him van Gaal's first signing since replacing David Moyes at Old Trafford.

'The Football League has certified 
Athletic Club that player Ander Herrera Agüera has fulfilled the 
requirements of the applicable regulations valid for unilateral 
termination of the employment contract that bound him to our club, by 
depositing today the amount of compensation established in the 
contract,' a Bilbao statement said.

'The Athletic Club thanks Ander Herrera for his dedication during the three seasons he has enjoyed at the club and wishes him the best in his future sports projects.'

A detailed timeline of the Herrera saga

'Signing for Manchester United is a dream come true,' said Herrera. 'I have played at Old Trafford for Athletic Club in the Europa League and it was one of the highlights of my career so far.

'I have joined United to do all I can to help the team reach the club's objectives. Having arrived on Tuesday I'm excited to now be living in Manchester and I can't wait for my first game in United's famous red shirt.'

The Spanish club had released a short statement on their website on Thursday morning saying a bid had been rejected.

It
 read: 'Athletic Club wishes to report that this week (it has) rejected 
an offer from Manchester United FC, estimated at 36 million euros, to 
transfer the economic rights of the player Ander Herrera.'

With the move confirmed, former club Real Zaragoza are due a £1m sell-on fee as part of any deal.

Herrera, an intelligent and stylish midfielder, was the subject of a £24m offer from David Moyes’s United last summer.

At that time they did not believe it was worth paying the best part of £5m more to make the deal happen.

United
 denied problems trying to sign Herrera last year — namely when three 
lawyers turned up at La Liga headquarters in an attempt to push through 
the transfer without knowledge of either club.

Herrera
 has been watched by United for more than three years, with Sir Alex 
Ferguson’s brother Martin among the first to bring him to the club’s 
attention.

Despite shelving the signing last August, Moyes had promised Herrera he would monitor his progress. A dip in form followed but he recovered to help propel Bilbao to fourth place in La Liga.

Herrera, part of Spain’s Olympic squad at London 2012, was also a team-mate of United’s Juan Mata and David de Gea with Spain under-21s.

Van Gaal is already starting to put his mark on the squad, with Antonio Valencia and Patrice Evra both signing contract extensions.
