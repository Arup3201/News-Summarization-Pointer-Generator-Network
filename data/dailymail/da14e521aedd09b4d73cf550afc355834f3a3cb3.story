Authorities are frantically searching for a 13-year-old girl who they believe could be in danger after running away with a 40-year-old man.

Samantha Dodson's parents awoke to find her missing from the family home in Oregon City, Oregon on Wednesday morning, her sister said.

The Clackamas County Sheriffâ€™s Office said she may be with Kelsey McCune, a friend of Dodson's father who has no known address. He had spent Thanksgiving with the family.

Authorities said the pair could be looking for places to camp.

'We're most worried about where she is and is she safe,' Samantha's sister, Sarah, told KATU. 'And then we're also really worried about their relationship and what is happening between them.'

Sarah added that she cannot imagine her sister looking for places to sleep, but authorities said the girl could have left willingly with McCune, KOIN reported.

The FBI has now joined the search.

The sheriff's office said that the girl has no history of suicide attempts or running away from home.

McCune is six feet tall and 170 pounds. He has a glass eye and graying hair.

His criminal history includes guilty pleas for reckless driving and attempted burglary.

'We're all just doing everything that we 
can to console one another and also to try to figure out where they 
are,' Dodson's sister added.
