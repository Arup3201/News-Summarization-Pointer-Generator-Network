Chelsea's new signings looked relaxed as they were pictured at Chelsea's pre-season training camp in Austria.

The squad were training in the sun but things were a bit chilly for Filipe Luis, Marco van Ginkel and Nathaniel Chalobah as they sat in the ice bath together.

Jose Mourinho, Gary Cahill and others were also snapped riding bicycles too and from training as they gear up for the new Premier League season.

Chelsea played Wolfsberger AC on Wednesday night but could only manage a draw with the Austrian side.

Mourinho's men were heading for defeat before the impressive Jeremie Boga scored a late equaliser.

Chelsea's remaining pre-season games are against Olimpija (July 27), Vitesse (July 30), Werder Bremen (August 3) and Ferencvaros (August 10) before they kick off the season away at Burnley.

Last season was only the second in Mourinho's career without winning a major trophy and the Portuguese will be determined to ensure that does not happen again.

Meanwhile,
 Didier Drogba's return to Chelsea took a step closer as Mourinho said 
he thought the Ivorian was still one of Europe's best strikers.

He said: ‘We want to win matches and win titles and Didier is one of the best strikers in Europe.

‘He is still very adapted to the needs of the Premier League and we are thinking about it in a  non-emotional way.

‘If
 you bring him back it is not because he is Didier or scored the most 
important goal in the history of Chelsea, or because I read I need an 
assistant, no.

‘If
 I bring him back, and the decision has to be made soon, it is because 
as a player he has qualities to make the team stronger.

'The team is not about the eleven. It is about the different options and as an option I would not say no about the possibility.’
