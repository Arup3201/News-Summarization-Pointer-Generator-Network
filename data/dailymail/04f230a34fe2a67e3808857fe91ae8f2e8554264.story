Barcelona may still be reeling from their Clasico loss to Real Madrid but you would not have known it as Lionel Messi scored a basket... with his head!

The Argentina ace was performing keep-ups with team-mates Javier Mascherano and Neymar during training as the trio advanced across the pitch with the ball.

However, the keep-ups soon progressed to a game of head tennis and Messi finished off the move with a delightful header into the basket.
