Monica Lewinsky has made it clear that she meant it when she announced that she will no longer live in hiding as she walked the red carpet at a Manhattan gala Thursday night.

Bill Clinton's former mistress broke her decades-long silence earlier this month by writing a tell-all essay for Vanity Fair and on Thursday she showed that she has no intention of stopping there.

Lewinsky, 40, attended the Kitchen Spring Gala Benefit with David Friend, a longtime confidante an the editor of creative development for Vanity Fair who convinced her to write the essay.

All smiles: The event was held in honor of a famed sculptor and was raising money for an art space in New York

Covered up: Rather than the white sheath she wore in the Vanity Fair spread, Lewinsky opted for a pink dress with a sheer black overlay with short lacy sleeves

She was wearing a rose-colored dress with a sheer black overlay that had short lacy sleeves covering part of her arms.

The benefit, held at Cipriani Wall Street, raised funds for one of the city's oldest non-profit spaces founded and used by artistic communities.

'People were surprised to see her there... there were a lot of double takes,' an attendee told The New York Post.

Though Lewinsky alluded to boyfriends during her years hiding from the spotlight, Friend is not one of them as he is married to children's book publisher Nancy Paulsen and they have two children.

Thursday's event was slated as an evening to honor sculptor Robert Longo, and Lewinsky reportedly wanted to attend because she is a fan of Longo's work.

'She saw some of my stuff when she was a 
teenager. She’s very sweet. I think she’s a courageous woman. She’s very
 smart, very cool to talk to,' Longo told the paper, explaining that it 
was the first time he had met Lewinsky.

'I told her I read that thing she wrote recently,       I told her, "I think you’re a pretty courageous woman."’

Longo was not the only artist that Lewinsky chatted with over the course of the evening.

The Post also reported that she spent time talking with artist Cindy Sherman and actor John Turturro who were the two co-hosts of the event.

In the Vanity Fair essay, Lewinsky wrote about how she has spent much of the past decade hidden because she fears that any move she makes will be played into Bill and Hillary Clinton's political narrative- one which shows no signs of slowing down since she is the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee in 2016.

Moving on: Monica Lewinsky has purposefully kept a private life in the wake of the scandal but now feels she can be an advocate for those who have the internet partially to blame for their problems (pictured in October 2012)

That embrace: Lewinsky maintains that she had a consensual relationship with then-President Clinton but felt used later by prosecutors and investigators

'When I hear of Hillary's prospective candidacy, I cannot help but fear the next wave of paparazzi, the next wave of "Where is she now?" stories, the next reference to me in Fox News's coverage of the primaries. I've begun to find it debilitating to plot out the cycle of my life, to some degree, on the political calendar,' she wrote.

It comes as little surprise that her first public appearance was at a charity event, since Lewinsky stated in the Vanity Fair piece that she hopes to use her name to help those who have been the victims of online bullying. 

'Thanks to the Drudge Report, I was also possibly the first person whose global humiliation was driven by the Internet.'

She views the Vanity Fair piece as a sign that she is ready to stop 'tiptoeing around my past- and other people's futures. I am determined to have a different ending to my story.'

'I've decided, finally, to stick my head above the parapet so that I can take back my narrative and give a purpose to my past. (What this will cost me, I will soon find out.)'
