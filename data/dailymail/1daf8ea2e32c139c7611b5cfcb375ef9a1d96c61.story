When it comes to highlighting their assets, Hollywood's hottest stars are proudly flaunting their plump rumps, ensuring that bosoms will continue to take a backseat to sculpted derrieres in 2015.

Jennifer Lopez may have been the first celebrity to turn her booty into a trademark, but the past 12 months have seen a bevy of big-bottomed celebrities, such as Kim Kardashian, Beyonce, Iggy Azalea and Nicki Minaj carving out star statuses for their now-infamous backsides.

From 'belfies' posted on Instagram to booty-shaking music videos, female stars are continuously paying homage to their butts. And the American public are taking notice.

Rear of the year? Kim Kardashian (L) almost 'broke the internet' when she uploaded this revealing 'belfie' to her Instagram account, while Beyonce (R) is renowned for boasting an impressively-pert behind

Musical notes: Both Nicki Minaj (L) and Jennifer Lopez (R) have written songs in honor of larger ladies and their bodacious booties and many people actually credit 45-year-old J-Lo with starting the trend for big backsides

Last year there was a 98per cent increase in butt implants and a 44per cent increase in butt lifts, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons – and those figures are showing no signs of decreasing any time soon.

'Media, television, and celebrities like J.Lo and Kim Kardashian are driving the increase, Dr Scott Glasberg, president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, explained.

He added: 'The butt is in.'

Not surprisingly, 2014 was also dubbed the ‘year of the booty’ by multiple media outlets thanks to popstar Nicki Minaj's Anaconda video and Jennifer Lopez’s Big Booty remix featuring Australian pop sensation Iggy Azalea.

Big butts were even celebrated in fashion bible Vogue.

Last September, the magazine's website announced that we were in the 'Era of the Big Booty', crediting 45-year-old Jennifer's breakout backside for moving body trends away from the waif-thin looks of the past.

Where celebrities once strived to maintain stick-thin figures, now they are embracing their curves, and regularly boast about the size of their behinds on social media.  

And then there are the 'belfie' models, whose bums are actually more famous than their faces.

Jen Selter, a 21-year-old from Long Island, New York, is one such belfie star - and has managed to build a whole social media empire around her booty.

She rose to fame in 2012 after she started posting fitness photos of herself highlighting her gravity-defying derriere.

Last year, Kim Kardashian, 34, made waves when she shared her own sexy belfie that showed off her pert behind in a skimpy white one-piece.

But Kim isn't the only person in the Kardashian clan who boasts a bodacious backside.

Her 30-year-old sister Khloe and her on-again-off-again best friend Blac Chyna are all card-carrying members of the big booty club.

Even the Kardashian sisters' nemesis, hip hop star Amber Rose, is known for twerking on camera and she frequently shares revealing photos of herself modeling the skimpiest thongs imaginable - all in order to showcase her impressive rear end.

Then there are the butts that pack something of a surprising punch. 

Rihanna, Jessica Biel, Lady Gaga, Sofia Vergara and Shakira all have booties that seem to defy gravity - and they all love to show them off.

And great bums also come in much smaller packages.

Glee star Lea Michele loves showing off her trim and toned backside on Instagram - particularly when she is on vacation - while Jessica Alba has a similarly pert bottom that she frequently emphasizes with a series of perfectly-tailored red carpet gowns.

Adult film star Farrah Abraham also has a butt that sparks conversation; the mother-of-one, who rose to fame while starring in MTV series Teen Mom, regularly flaunts her physique on the red carpet, ensuring to highlight her backside as much as possible.

And who can forget when Pippa Middleton's behind stole the show at her sister Kate's 2011 wedding to Prince William?

The then-27-year-old and her pert bottom were the talk of the town after she was snapped at the ceremony wearing a figure-hugging white bridesmaids dress while walking down the aisle behind her sister, the Duchess of Cambridge. 

Here, we list Hollywood's hottest - and most talked-about - butts - but it is up to you to decide whose rear end will reign above all.
