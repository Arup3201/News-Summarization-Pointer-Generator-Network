Hillary Clinton has been awarded an honorary doctors degree from one of the UK’s oldest universities to celebrate her success as a politician and diplomat.

The former US secretary of state attended a graduation address at a ceremony marking the 600th anniversary of the founding of St Andrews University in Scotland.

It is Mrs Clinton's first foreign visit since her term as secretary of state ended in February, which saw her join a group of over a dozen honorary graduates in the picturesque Fife coastal town.

Honoured: Former US Secretary of State Hilary Clinton received an honorary doctor of law degree from St Andrews University

She was conferred with a Doctor of Laws degree by Liberal Democrat politician and chancellor of St Andrews, Sir Menzies Campbell, alongside other honorary doctors, including former Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams and inventor of the world wide web Professor Sir Tim Berners-Lee.

As well as her achievements in politics, the degree also celebrates her efforts to champion the causes of education, human rights, democracy, civil society and promoting opportunities for women around the world, according to the university.

The former US first lady, whose husband Bill was president for eight years between 1993 and 2001, later delivered a impassioned 
defence of human rights and equality to an audience of education 
leaders, university staff and students.

‘We need more voices speaking up
for universal human rights.

‘We have honoured some of the great advocates here today who have spoken out courageously for women's rights, gay rights and religious understanding, showing us that our communities and institutions are strongest when equality and opportunity are open to all people and freedom of conscience is respected. 

Mrs Clinton was one of a handful recipients of honorary degrees at the ceremony to mark the 600th anniversary of the founding of the University

'It is important that as we chart our way forward in this new century, we
bring with it the enlightened view that every individual around the 
world regardless of gender, religion, race, ethnicity or orientation, 
should be able to contribute to their societies and to have the chance 
to live up to his or her God given potential.

‘We
are confronting deep cultural and political differences. Change can be 
very wrenching and it is difficult to bridge the gaps between and within
societies.

‘We will never 
agree on everything, but spirited and principled debate is the 
lifeblood of democracies and today our democracies are under stress.

‘It
is more important than ever that we rally behind what started here and 
elsewhere, where the individual was endowed by his creator with those 
rights that enabled first men and slowly women and others to be full 
participants in their society.

‘Now
we need in this new age participation on a much grander scale to make 
the case for the importance of those fundamental values.’

Royal approval: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge met when they were studying at St Andrews University

The Duke of Cambridge congratulated the university on its 600th anniversary in a letter which was read out by Sir Menzies at the beginning of the ceremony.

Prince William, who met his wife Catherine while studying at St Andrews, wrote: 'As a proud new father, I have come to think more than ever about the world our children will inherit; and the role of education, research and intellectual courage in our society has never seemed so important.

'For Catherine and me, the University of St Andrews is an emblem of these virtues.

'As proud patron of the Anniversary Appeal, I am delighted to offer my congratulations to all the university’s honorary graduates today and my warmest congratulations to an institution that may be 600-years-old but which has never been as vital. Happy birthday, St Andrews.'

As he welcomed guests and graduates, Sir Menzies also read out a letter from Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone which passed on the congratulations of Pope Francis.

'His Holiness Pope Francis was pleased to be informed of the celebrations marking the 600th anniversary of foundation of the University of St Andrews and he sends cordial greetings to all taking part,' the cardinal wrote.

'His Holiness is confident that the noble work of education and research in a wide range of academic fields will continue to flourish in the city that bears the same name of Scotland’s patron saint.'

St Andrews principal and vice-president, Professor Louise Richardson, said the university has lasted so long because of it’s 'enduring value'.

She said: '600 years is a very long time. How many institutions can you think of that have been around that long? Not many.'

Honorary degrees were also bestowed on the former Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, classicist Professor Mary Beard, inventor of the world wide web Professor Sir Tim Berners-Lee, primatologist Dame Jane Goodall, particle physicist Professor Peter Higgs - who could not attend - anthropologist Professor Dame Marilyn Strathern and philosopher Professor Nancy Cartwright.

The university, said to be the third oldest in the English-speaking world, has historic links with the US as three of the signatories to the Declaration of Independence, Benjamin Franklin, James Wilson and John Witherspoon, studied at or held degrees from St Andrews.
