A comedian has become a virtual globetrotter after embarking on a mission to talk to one person from every country in the world.

Mark Malkoff has managed to contact more than 80 per cent of the world's nations via Skype - including the secretive state of North Korea.

Now he has channelled his surreal experiences into a YouTube video charting a manic three-day computer sessions during which he spent 27 hours talking to people from all corners of the world.

Mission: Comedian Mark Malkoff has spoken to people in 162 different countries using Skype

Virtual tourism: Many of those the comedian spoke to showed him local landmarks during their conversation

Global conversation: Nearly everyone he spoke to was a total stranger who got in touch via social media

Mr Malkoff, who is based in New York and is known for his online videos and television appearances, announced the start of the project on his Facebook page earlier this year.

He immediately got a warm response from his 3,600 followers, offering to put him in touch with their friends living in obscure countries around the world.

The 36-year-old was dependent on the generosity of strangers, who were happy to spend 10 minutes talking to a man they'd never met for the project, designed to celebrate Skype's 10th anniversary.

In the end, he managed to contact 162 different countries - including war-torn states such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and Egypt.

Playful: Mr Malkoff connected with people around the world by making funny faces at them

Remote: He even found contacts in troubled countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria

'I wanted to show how the world is getting smaller and show how technology is bringing us together,' he said.

'I put out a call on Facebook and Twitter to find someone to Skype with in every single country - and I was overwhelmed by the response.

'I didn't know most of these people - I just said, "Can I call you?"

'I was touched that people wanted to let me into their homes and share their family and their country with me. People are so proud of their countries and really wanted to show me the best of them.'

Of all the many conversations Mr Malkoff had, the one he which he found the most 'meaningful' was with Ireland, because of the extraordinary show which the country put on for him.

'The person I talked to arranged for an Irish pub to play for me,' he said.

Joke: Mr Malkoff boasted that his wife was Snooki - but his new Ethiopian friend did not recognise her from MTV reality show Jersey Shore

Unexpected: When he was talking to Costa Rica, the comedian came face to face with a chicken

Connection: Mr Malkoff was able to establish a bond with almost anyone through a shared love of pets

Another memorable experience was talking to North Korea, when a woman who runs tours to the country agreed to chat to him while she watched a football match.

'I was determined to speak to someone in North Korea, because so many people told me it couldn't be done,' he said. 'It was definitely the most difficult call to arrange, but it was among my favourites.

'When I called China, they answered the call in Tiananmen Square - that was amazing. I got to see so many places that I would never have been able to go to all around the world in real time.

'I answered as many calls as I could in New York City, and showed people the Brooklyn Bridge or Times Square - and I think people liked chatting to me just as much as I enjoyed chatting to them.

'Most people managed to speak English, and I know some Spanish, so I managed to speak to most people, but there were a few where we just smiled and waved at each other and showed each other our surroundings.

'I got to see a lot of pets - and people wanted to see my pets too.'

Victory! Perhaps the hardest country of all to contact is North Korea, but Mr Malkoff managed it

Family: The virtual globetrotter has been delighted to connect with people around the world

Exhausted: But Mr Malkoff is still keen to get in touch with the final 31 countries on the list

Mr Malkoff never even saw the face of one of his new friends - when he called Algeria, he spoke to a Muslim woman wearing a burqa which covered up her features.

But the most surreal conversation came when he needed to tick off the U.S. - and Skyped his wife as she was sitting in the next room.

While his careful planning allowed him to carry out the project with extraordinary success, it was not without a few mishaps.

When he phoned Indonesia, he found his correspondent in total darkness as he had slipped up and called in the middle of the night.

'That was the hard thing, calculating the different time changes,' he said.

Mr Malkoff has concluded the project for now - but he still has 31 countries to go, and is considering restarting in order to collect a full set.

'I might do it, just because I had such an amazing time talking to people,' he said.
