Chelsea's on-loan striker Fernando Torres has suffered another setback in his attempt to rediscover the form that once made him a £50million striker.

The Spaniard had been expected to make his AC Milan debut on Sunday night against Parma, but the club revealed just an hour before kick-off that he had failed to recover from an ankle sprain picked up in training on Saturday.

The club tweeted: 'Towards the end of yesterday’s training session at Milanello, Fernando @Torres sprained his left ankle #ParmaMilan'.
