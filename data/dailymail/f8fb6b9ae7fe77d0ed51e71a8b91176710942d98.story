Lewis Hamilton has celebrated his Sports Personality of the Year win by taking some friends and family on a skiing trip.

The Formula One driver posted two pictures on his Instagram page in the wake of his award win, showing him taking some time out of his busy schedule to hit the slopes.

First, the 29-year-old shared a photo of him and his friends and brother Nicolas standing next to a private jet, ready to leave on the skiing trip. A caption alongside the photo read: 'Heading out to go snowboarding with some of my favourite people early last week!'

It appears the group - including Hamilton's dog Roscoe (left) - travelled to the slopes on a private plane 

His brother Nicolas was also alongside him in another photo, an action shot from a snow-covered ski slope, with the caption, 'My brother and I hitting the slopes last week! Great fun!'

Hamilton won the 2014 BBC Sports Personality of the Year award earlier this month ahead of golfer Rory McIlroy and athlete Jo Pavey.

The Mercedes driver romped to his second F1 title this season, in the process becoming the fourth Briton to win the drivers' championship at least twice.

It is Hamilton's first Sports Personality crown, after twice missing out in 2007 and 2008, to Joe Calzaghe and Sir Chris Hoy respectively.
