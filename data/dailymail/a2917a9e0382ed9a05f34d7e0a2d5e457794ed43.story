Mercedes have trialled a modified exhaust system in a bid to raise the sound levels of Formula One.

The noise produced by the new 1.6-litre turbo engines has come under scrutiny from most corners of the sport this season with a working group subsequently tasked to find a solution.

Mercedes, who supply engines to four teams on the grid, have led the development process in cooperation with the FIA and under Bernie Ecclestone's insistence.

New look: The tail pipe has been dramatically widened since Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix

The 'trumpet' design was unveiled for the first time on the back of Nico Rosberg's W05 hybrid during Wednesday's test at the Circuit de Catalunya.

The tail pipe, which has been widened in order to create more volume, will then be evaluated by the FIA, who are taking measurements to assess its impact.

Speaking to Spotrtsmail last week, Rosberg, who finished second in Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix, said: 'Mercedes have done lots of work on trying to make the cars louder and have a greater engine noise. They have come up with good solutions, we have tested them in the factory and they work, so now we will test them on the track next week.

'Then it is a matter for the FIA to get all the teams to agree and try and get the things on the cars.'

Rosberg, three points adrift of Lewis Hamilton in the championship after the Briton's win in Spain,Â  was hesitant to put a timescale on when the louder engines would be introduced at a grand prix weekend, and warned that all of the teams would have to reach an agreement before they were ratified.

'I understand the cars are not loud enough for the fans and that's part of the sport's attraction,' added Rosberg. 'It depends on the teams agreeing so it is going to take a bit of time.'

Sauber's Giedo van der Garde ran in Tuesday's session, with Esteban Gutierrez replacing him on Wednesday but the former Caterham driver was on the pit-wall and also did not think Rosberg's car sounded much different to other runners.

'You hear a bit more sound, but it was not huge,' he told Sky Sports News. 'Everyone is complaining about the sound but it is how it is. The cars go fast in a straight line and I quite like it. You get the whistle from a turbo and I'm quite pleased by it. For me it is fine.'
