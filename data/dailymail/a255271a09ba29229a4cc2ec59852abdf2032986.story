Wolves boss Kenny Jackett believes Sir Jack Hayward's life should be celebrated as the club plan further tributes.

The club's former owner, who bankrolled them to a return to the top flight in 2003, passed away on Tuesday aged 91.

He owned Wolves for 17 years before selling to Steve Morgan in 2007 for just £10, in return for a £30million investment into the club.

Hours after the news of his death was announced Wolves were knocked out of the FA Cup after a 5-3 third-round penalty defeat to Fulham following a 3-3 draw.

The club are planning a full tribute before Saturday's Championship visit of Blackpool and Jackett knows Hayward deserves every honour.

'He is one of Wolves' favourite sons, not just at the club but the area. He was the owner for 17 years and when I met him he was a true gentleman. It is a life which should be celebrated,' he said.

'People within the industry spoke of him very well, Graham Taylor who was the manager here, and he was very well thought of by everyone in football. He had a first class reputation.

'When I met him over the last year and a half he was a true gentleman.

'Sir Jack put a lot of time and effort into the club, he started the development of the training ground and the fantastic ground we have here at moment.

'He will be missed and was very well thought of by everyone in the club.'

Former Wolves goalkeeper Matt Murray also paid tribute to Hayward.

Murray made 100 appearances for Wolves before being forced to retire with a knee injury in 2008.

He was in the side which won the play-off final 3-0 against Sheffield United to realise Hayward's dream of returning to the top flight in 2003.

Murray said: 'I remember when myself and Robbie Keane were in Miami just chilling, and he heard we were there and sent his jet over to pick up Robbie and myself and our wives and put us up in a nice little hut on the beach.

'It was all off his own bat but he was so generous. He organised for us to swim with dolphins, took us to his restaurant and he was such a humble guy for someone who had done so well.

'He always made a fuss of the young kids at the training ground and he had time for everybody.'

Chief executive Jez Moxey, who was appointed by Hayward, insisted his love for the club never waned.

He said: 'He would tune in every single game wherever he was in the world, he was always doing a world cruise every year for four or five months. Day or night he would wake up and listen to the matches or try to watch them without fail.'
