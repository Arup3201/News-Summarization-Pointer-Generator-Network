The NHS is to spend £250million to clear a massive backlog of knee, cataract and hip replacement operations.

Jeremy Hunt will today announce that the injection of cash will help ensure no one waits more than a year for treatment – unless it is clinically necessary.

But the plan will also mean longer waiting times for tens of thousands of patients.

Surgeons: The NHS is to spend £250million to clear a backlog of knee, cataract and hip replacement operations

The number of people on the NHS waiting list now stands at 3.1million – its highest for six years; with almost 600 having waited for longer than 12 months. The Health Secretary will say the money will pay for up to 100,000 operations over the next few months in a bid to treat some of those who have waited the longest.

Officials admit that meeting the backlog will cause a short-term rise in the number of people waiting more than 18 weeks – still the most important target for hospitals – breaching a national pledge that 90 per cent of patients should be treated within this timescale.

Ministers say this short-term breach is necessary to clear the huge backlog in elective surgery, which they attribute to higher demand and an ageing society. It means an extra 100,000 people a month are being referred for treatment compared to 2010, with hospitals performing an extra 2,000 operations a day.

But Labour will say that the new 12-month treatment pledge is merely a way to deflect attention from a failure to tackle growing waiting lists in the health service over the past four years.

Action should be targeted at all those on the waiting list – not just the longest – they say.

In May 2010, the month of the last election, some 20,662 patients had waited for 18 weeks or more. By May 2014, this total had soared to 29,847.

The situation is so bad in some trusts that patients have been urged to pay privately if they want to be treated more quickly.

The clinical commissioning group in Southampton, for example, has imposed tough restrictions on cataract operations – and has been named and shamed by the RNIB.

'We need targets that help patients': Jeremy Hunt will announce that the injection of cash will help ensure no one waits more than a year for treatment

At the same time, the local trust – Southampton University Hospitals – allows people denied NHS treatment to pay for the service that would otherwise be provided free. Its website offers ‘a new option, between the traditional private sector and the NHS’.

Mr Hunt’s response is to target those waiting more than a year. In May 2014, 574 people were in this position – down from 18,458 four years previously.

Every person who has waited more than 52 weeks or is on the verge of doing so will have their case reviewed to see whether they should be fast-tracked.

On a visit to Royal Surrey County Hospital in Guildford, the Health Secretary will say: ‘No one – except in exceptional circumstances – should have to wait more than a year.

‘[We need] targets that help patients get treatment when they need it – not targets followed blindly with no regard for the impact on individuals.

‘An NHS confident that – in the end – it will continue to meet the huge challenges ahead if it leaves room, amongst many loud, competing pressures, for the quietest but most important voice of all: that of the patient.’

Liz Kendall, a Labour health spokeswoman, said: ‘David Cameron promised to protect patient care, but instead he has lost control of waiting times.

‘The number of people waiting more than 18 weeks for their treatment has increased by 50 per cent since 2010, and the cancer waiting time target has been missed for the first time ever.

‘The Tories have mismanaged the NHS – and it’s patients who are paying the price.’

Funded by the extra £250million, the NHS will in the next few weeks carry out more than 100,000 treatments to people who have been waiting more than 18 weeks, of which 40,000 will be admitted to hospital.

It will also conduct an immediate review of every person waiting over or close to 52 weeks. Treating them will be a priority, unless there are strong clinical reasons for the delay or the patient chooses to wait longer.

A Department of Health source said: ‘Because operations on longer waiters are often more complex and difficult, they take more time and resources.

‘However, by the end of the year the NHS will start meeting the target again.’
