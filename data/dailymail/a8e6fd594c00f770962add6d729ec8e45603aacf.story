Hundreds of mourners turned out to pay tribute today to Gerry Anderson, beloved creator of television shows such as Thunderbirds.

The visionary puppeteer, who also created Captain Scarlet, Joe 90 and Stingray, died last month at the age of 83.

His funeral was full of references to his most famous work, as the congregation heard the Thunderbirds theme tune and saw the original puppets from Mr Anderson's shows.

Hero: The replica car was a two-year labour of love for Mr Jarvis, a huge fan of Thunderbirds

Farewell: Hundreds gathered on Friday for the funeral of Thunderbirds creator Gerry Anderson

Coffin: Mr Anderson's hearse contained a flower display in the shape of Thunderbird 2

A flower arrangement of Thunderbird 2, the iconic green aeroplane, sat on top of his coffin as it arrived at Reading Crematorium in a black hearse.

The hearse was accompanied by a replica of FAB1, the pink car belonging to the show's Lady Penelope, and a flower display spelling out the word 'FAB'.

Mr Anderson, who lived in nearby Henley-on-Thames with his third wife Mary, had been diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease around two years before he died.

His youngest son, Jamie, delivered a touching eulogy at the humanist service.

'My dad made a huge impact on the lives of millions and left a phenomenal legacy behind him,' he said.

He added that his father's dignified response to his Alzheimer's diagnosis - including raising Â£1million for the Alzheimer's Society by taking part in a 'memory walk' last year - gave him more pride than his TV career.

'Dad decided to speak out about his condition despite the social stigma and the debilitating effects of the disease,' Jamie said.

'Beyond all of his achievements in television and film, I feel most proud of him for making this incredibly brave decision and the manner in which he threw himself into being an ambassador for the society despite his worsening condition.'

Actor Shane Rimmer, who voiced the character of Scott Tracy in Thunderbirds, offered a glowing tribute to Mr Anderson's 'groundbreaking energy and vision'.

He said: 'Gerry was an exceptional man - not only to those who began the studio work with him, and they were all terribly talented and so easy to work with - but also to the hundreds of thousands of young, and maybe a little older, viewers who watched that magic flow across television screens all over the world.'

Broadway producer John Gore, the man behind the Thunderbirds stage show, said: 'The legacy of Gerry is going to continue in a way that is going to go on for generations.'

Nick Williams, chairman of official Gerry Anderson society Fanderson, said: 'To those who met him, Gerry was a quiet, unassuming but determined man.

'His desire to make the best films he could drove him and his talented teams to innovate, take risks and do everything necessary to produce quite inspirational works.

'Gerry's legacy is that he inspired so many people and continues to bring so much joy to so many millions of people around the world.'

He added: 'Gerry's unique style of film-making influenced the imaginations and careers of countless creatives who succeeded him and his productions continue to be shown around the world to new generations of fans.'

Iconic: The Thunderbird 2 aircraft is one of Mr Anderson's most recognisable creations

Slogan: As well as the aircraft, one floral tribute spelled out 'FAB', another reference to the show

The Thunderbirds March, performed by the Band of the Royal Marines, played moments before the 300 mourners filed out following the 45-minute service.

Outside the chapel stood a full-size replica - complete with an extendable rocket - of FAB1, the pink Rolls Royce belonging to Lady Penelope.

Owner Melvin Jarvis said he had driven the car, which he built himself, down from his Leicester home out of respect for his hero.

'Ever since being a child I remember watching Thunderbirds and saying, "I'll have one of those one day," and it's never left me,' he said.

Beloved: Gerry Anderson died last month at the age of 83 having created a series of 1960s TV shows

Characters: Scott, Lady Penelope and Virgil, three of the puppets from the hit children's show
