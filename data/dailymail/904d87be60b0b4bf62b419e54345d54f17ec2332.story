These amazing pictures show a group of adrenalin junkies making the most of the recent heavy rainfall by wakeboarding in a flooded Surrey car park.

Speeding between the pillars of the Bedford Road Car Park in Guildford are Jorge Gill, 18, from London and Jack Hammersley, 24, from Surrey - who spotted the space and thought it would make for excellent boarding conditions.

But with no room for a boat - the two 
acquired a Red Bull winch pulley system from their friend Nick Mangos, 27, which can pull in boarders at break-neck speeds.

Jack Hammersley, 24, then takes his turn on the winch - narrowly avoiding an array of concrete pillars dotted throughout the space

The boarders were pulled in over the 2ft-deep water in the Surrey carpark using a winch pulley system (pictured centre)

The two waited until yesterday night to set up the system - away from the glare of passers-by. Once it was all set to go, they then weaved around several precarious pillars, taking amazing footage as they went.

And, when the thrill of dodging through the carpark wasn't enough, the boys moved on to nearby Shalford Park to pull out some jumps and tricks.

The system works by pulling the users in at speeds of over 15mph.

The boarders walk out as far as they can with the wire before being winched in by the machine. When either the water runs out or they fall, the boarder lets go and the winch continues without them.

The water in the carpark was up to 2ft deep, but only 1ft deep in the park.

Jorge Gill is a professional wakeboarder and Jack Hammersley a professional wakeboard coach.

But despite their experience, Mr Hammersley managed to have a painful fall at the hands of the pulley.

Nick Mangos, 27, who was operating the winch, said: 'Jack came out of the water at one point and fell face first onto the bank at Shalford Park.

'He was alright though, but it was pretty bad. We have all been friends for years and, with the recent rain, the others had scouted out these two spots as good places to go.

'As we weren't really suppose to be there, we waited until after dark when all the shoppers had gone. I then brought the winch and set it up and the others had a great time.

'I think they were a bit worried as they had concrete around them and not far below them. But that's all part of the fun. Using the winch isn't really done much - so I think others should be encouraged to try it out.'
