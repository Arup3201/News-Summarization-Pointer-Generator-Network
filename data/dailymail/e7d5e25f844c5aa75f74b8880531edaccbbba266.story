Ruthless: Irene Rosenfeld provoked anger with her takeover of Cadbury's in 2010

The boss behind the controversial Cadbury’s takeover has been awarded a 31.5 per cent pay rise – despite being accused of tax dodging and poor performance.

Irene Rosenfeld sparked fury when, as head of American processed cheese firm Kraft, she took over the much-loved British company in a £11.6billion deal.

America’s second highest-paid woman has now seen her pay package jump from £14.4million to £18.9million.

The businesswoman, who received a £6.6million bonus, also claimed she needs to travel by private jet to be ‘productive and efficient’.

This was despite a 36 per cent fall in net income at her firm Mondelez – which now owns Cadbury’s.

Miss Rosenfeld provoked anger at Cadbury’s historic Bournville site after her ruthless takeover of the confectioner in 2010. She became a hate figure for breaking her promise to keep Cadbury’s Somerdale factory open only weeks after the takeover.

And she repeatedly refused to account for her actions to politicians on the Commons business, innovation and skills committee.

Indian tax authorities have even accused her firm of pretending to make chocolate bars at an imaginary factory in order to dodge extra levies.

Despite all of this, she has been held up as an example of a model career woman in America.

After rising through the ranks at Kraft over a 20-year period, Miss Rosenfeld left to lead rival food group Frito-Lay in 2004.

Criticism: Irene Rosenfeld came under fire for the decision to close the Cadbury's factory in Somerdale

She engineered a return to Kraft as chief executive in 2006, but even big-name investors like Warren Buffett questioned her acquisition of Cadbury’s in 2010. In 2011 she confirmed her critics’ worst fears by announcing plans to lay off up to 200 people at Cadbury’s birthplace. Despite pledging not to make any plant closures or compulsory redundancies until March 2012, she ended up wielding the axe a few weeks later.

After masterminding a plan to split Kraft in two, Miss Rosenfeld remained with the snack business that makes Oreo biscuits, Ritz crackers and Dairy Milk bars, while spinning off the larger cheese-based business which kept the Kraft name.

However, since the split in October, Mondelez has disappointed. In its first two quarters, revenue growth fell short of its own forecasts, with net income down 29 per cent and 36 per cent respectively.

But the poor results do not seem to have had any impact on Miss Rosenfeld’s huge pay rewards. She received a £6.6million bonus for splitting the businesses in two, basic pay of £1million, and a performance-based bonus of £1.3million – down from £2.7million in the previous year.

The scandal-hit boss also received £10.2million in stocks, £1.6million in share options and a £4.47million lift in the value of her pension.
