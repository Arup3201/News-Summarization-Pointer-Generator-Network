A young bookworm is distraught after a tiny outdoor library he erected on his front lawn for a Mother’s Day present had to be removed – because it violated city building codes.

Nine-year-old Spencer Collins from Kansas built a ‘Free Little Library’ with the help of his grandfather after his mother mentioned that she thought they were a good idea.

The library - a bookcase with a tiled roof supported by wooden struts – carries the message ‘take a book, leave a book’.

Distraught: Spencer Collins' little lending library fell foul of Leawood building regulations and had to be removed from the front lawn

They are becoming an increasingly popular way to encourage reading, with neighbors able to take a book in return for donating one of their own.

However, Spencer’s library has fallen foul of building laws.

Rules in Leawood, where he lives, stipulate that structures are not allowed on the lawns of single-family homes.

Relocation: The library has been moved from the front lawn to the Collins' garage

Officials said that unless the structure was attached to the house, the family would face a fine.

The library is still up and running – but has been placed in the family’s garage.

Spencer Collins told Fox4KC: ‘Reading is one of my favorite things to do. We built it on Mother’s Day as a present for my mom because she really wanted one.’

The Collins family isn't taking the ruling lying down, however.

They will appeal to city officials to have the law changed.

Mayor Peggy Dunn confirmed to Kansascity.com that the issue of front-yard lending libraries being unlawful will be top of the agenda during a July 7 City Council meeting.
