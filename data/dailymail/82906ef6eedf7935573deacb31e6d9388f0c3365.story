Scotland will not join the euro for ‘the foreseeable future’ if it breaks away from the rest of the UK, Alex Salmond insisted today.

The Scottish First Minister was forced to repeatedly defend his claim that if voters back independence in next year’s referendum it will not mean having to reapply to join the European Union.

And he went further, claiming it was ‘simply incredible’ to think Brussels would not welcome the new independent nation with open arms.

This week Parliament is due to sign off the rules for holding the independence referendum in autumn 2014.

Questions about an independent Scotland’s place in the EU have dogged Mr Salmond for months, with the European Commission insisting a new nation would have to make a new application.

But he said: 'This is a negotiation that will take place after the constitutional referendum of 2014, of course Scotland will still be a member of the UK and therefore, by definition, negotiating from within the European Union. 

'The point of independence doesn’t happen until the transfer of sovereignty, which will happen before the Scottish elections in 2016. We’re talking about after the referendum of 2014, giving that time for negotiation.'

Several countries including Spain have made clear it would block Scotland’s entry.

But Mr Salmond said: ‘The idea that oil-rich, fishing-rich, renewable energy-rich Scotland will not be wanted as part of the European Union is simply incredible.’

He contrasted his enthusiasm for joining the EU with David Cameron's move, in a speech this Friday, to renegotiate powers back from Brussels.

Mr Salmond’s Scottish National Party has previously backed the idea of Scotland joining the single currency, but today he ruled it out.

‘There’s no prospect of them being members of the euro and currently and for the foreseeable future there’s no prospect of Scotland, an independent Scotland, being a member of the euro,' he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

‘What there is every prospect of is that oil-rich, fishing-rich, renewable energy-rich Scotland will certainly be wanted in the European Union and it’s also the case that a country which actually wants to be part of the European Union is more likely to end up as part of the European Union.’

MPs last night tonight agreed to hand the Scottish Parliament the powers it needs to hold the referendum on independence.

The Government's order, which hands power to Holyrood to hold the poll in the autumn of next year, now needs to be approved by the House of Lords today.

The order was passed unopposed by MPs as Scottish Secretary Michael Moore told the House of Commons the ‘great debate’ about whether Scotland could now separate from the rest of the United Kingdom could begin.

He said the legal order would give the Scottish Parliament the legal, fair and decisive referendum pledged in the Edinburgh Agreement and signed by Mr Salmond and Mr Cameron last year.

Mr Moore said: ‘Deciding Scotland's future within the UK will be the most important decision we as Scots take in our lifetime.

‘It is now essential the referendum decision is focused on determining whether Scotland chooses to remain an integral part of the most successful partnership of nations the world has ever seen, to remain part of a family of nations that works in the interests of all - or whether Scotland wishes to leave and go it alone.’
