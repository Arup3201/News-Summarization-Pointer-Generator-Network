 

She may be a Hollywood star who brings immense drama to her roles, but Keira Knightley reveals that in her personal life she's as down to earth as they come.

The actress, 29, recently left a premiere early to rush home and catch the finale of the Great British Bake Off.

And she says a perfect birthday celebration consists of bowling, karaoke, and 'lots of cupcakes', in a new interview with Net-A-Porter's weekly online fashion glossy The EDIT.

She is known to attend glamorous photo shoots on her own, without an agent or assistant. 

'Why not?,' she says.

'It's nicer than coming in and being completely shut off it. And it's much easier just to have a conversation yourself where it's either, "Yes, I'll do that," or "No, I won't".'

In the interview Keira discusses Hollywood's double standards and embracing the ageing process.

With an impressive history of strong, female roles, it is unsurprising that the actress is an advocate for gender equality in Hollywood.

Keira is known to attend  photo shoots without an agent or assistant: 'Why not?' she says

'The people who make movies, whether it's directors or producers, or money people, look for things that they can identify with and if they're all predominantly middle-aged white men, then what you see are things that middle-aged white men can identify with. 

'And you don't get anything for anybody else.' 

Though happily married, Keira says that she has given up on fairy tales because women do not need men to come to their rescue.

'A friend of mine just had a daughter. It's a political thing, having a baby girl, in a way that it isn't for a boy. You think, 'Oh isn't this fairy tale lovely?' Then suddenly you worry, 'What am I planting with that? I don't want her to be waiting around for a man to fix her problems. 

'Maybe it's a bit silly, but because equality is going so hugely the other way, I think it probably does take being silly to try and swing it back around.'

With regards to the future, Keira is ready to take anything that comes with her trademark poise.

Unlike the childlike character she plays in new fil Laggies, Keira is embracing ageing, even if she is not quite sure what 'grown-up' is meant to feel like.

While Keira admits to not having all of the answers, she is looking forward to trying to find them.
