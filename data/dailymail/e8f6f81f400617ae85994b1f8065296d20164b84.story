The power of Twitter has been highlighted once again after its users selected a new entry for the Collins English Dictionary.

Collins scoured the microblogging site to find emerging 
words and the winning term, which will be added to its official dictionary later this year, was 'adorkable'.

The term, which means 'adorable dork' was first used on Twitter in March 2007 before peaking in January 2012, and was the most-voted word from a shortlist drawn up by the publisher.

Twitter users were asked to vote on new words to enter the October 2014 edition of the Collins English Dictionary. Entries were tweeted using a hashtag and the winning word was 'adorkable', which means a person who is 'dorky in an adorable way' (stock image pictured)

According to Collins, adorkable is an adjective that is slang for a 'socially inept or unfashionable person that conducts themselves in a charming or endearing way'. It is a blend of 'adorable' and 'dork'.

The researchers said it has 
now settled into a 'steady and rising pattern of use.'

The shortlisted words were crowdsourced, drawn from those submitted by members of the public on www.collinsdictionary.com.

Analysis of the words, to define levels of usage, was carried out in the Collins Corpus and on Twitter to ensure that all of the words under consideration were in general use, before they were included in the shortlist.

Using Twitter data to measure a word’s popularity is a natural extension of the established process by which Collins English Dictionary is compiled, the company said.

It analysed word usage across a range of UK and international print and digital media held in the Collins Corpus - an enormous database of over 4.5 billion words that is constantly updated.

To vote, users needed to tweet using a hashtag of their favourite word - such as #adorkable - with Collins then seeing which words had the most mentions.

The winning word, adorkable, will enter the October 2014 edition of the Collins English Dictionary.

1. Adorkable, which means dorky in an adorable way, won the day with 30 per cent of the vote.

2. Felfie, or a farmer selfie, achieved 22 per cent of the vote.

3. Fatberg, which is a large mass of solid waste or grease clogging up a sewage system, won 13 per cent of the vote.

4. Nomakeupselfie  - a selfie of a woman without her make-up, posted online to raise awareness for a charity - was coined during a social media craze started by Cancer Research.

5. Gaybourhood is a gay-friendly 
neighbourhood such as Castro in San Francisco. Use of gaybourhood on Twitter has grown steadily 
since its first appearance in a tweet in March 2006.

Adorkable underwent a huge surge in popularity after the TV show New Girl, starring Zooey Deschanel (pictured in May 2014), was launched on 20 September 2011. She is often described using the term, which led to it storming to the front of the 'Twictionary' competition run by Collins

'We are excited about using Twitter because it offers open, accessible public data for us to monitor and analyse through its APIs (application programming interface),' said Andrew Freeman, Associate Publishing Director for Collins.

'Twitter is a news site with robust patterns of usage and reactions to events and growing movements which lend themselves to language development and invention.

'Twitter's limit of 140 characters per message puts a focus on language, meaning users have to come up with new words and language to make the most of the platform.

'This is the first activity of its kind - using social media to compile dictionary entries - and we would be keen to work with a range of social media channels in the future.

The company said using Twitter to choose a new word is a natural evolution of the process usually used to select new words. Fracktivist, for example, is a word growing in popularity used to describe someone who protests against fracking, but it didn't make the final five words (stock image pictured)

Lucy Mangan, who blogs on collinsdictionary.com and is a contributor to Collins English Dictionary, added: 'The people - or at least the tweeple - have spoken!

‘Adorkable is the word they can't be without.

'Into the dictionary it goes, allowing Collins to close the gap between the recording of a living language and its movements in the real world more than ever before.'

'At last the internet starts giving something back to word nerds.'
