Barack Obama dramatically escalated his plans for military action in Syria yesterday.

The US president said proposed strikes against the regime were part of a ‘broader strategy’ to topple Bashar Assad, who is accused of killing hundreds of civilians with chemical weapons.

The suggestion of ‘regime change’ emerged as tensions in the region were heightened further by the Israeli firing of two missiles in the eastern Mediterranean in the early hours of yesterday.

Confident: US President Barack Obama, who today met members of Congress in the Cabinet Room of the White House, said he thought a resolution paving the way for military intervention in Syria would be passed

President Obama’s remarks helped win support in Washington from sceptical Republicans, who have cast doubt on the value of a ‘symbolic’ strike in response to the use of poison gas.

But they also suggested there is already ‘mission creep’ in the planned US intervention in the wartorn country, reflecting the fears of Tory and Liberal Democrat rebels who joined with Labour to defeat David Cameron over plans to join military action last week.

Despite the crushing blow to the Prime Minister’s plans, Downing Street yesterday repeatedly refused to rule out doing more to support rebel leaders in Syria.

Sources said providing arms to the 
rebels – a move opposed earlier this year by more than 80 Conservative 
MPs – was ‘not on the cards’.

However,
it is expected that Britain could provide more technical support and 
equipment, including chemical weapons protection kit, and assistance in 
areas opposition forces have taken from the regime.

Foreign Secretary William Hague told the Commons that Britain is already the second-largest donor to humanitarian causes in Syria and promised that ‘we will do more’. Britain remains ‘highly active’ in seeking an end to the violence, he told MPs.

Israel yesterday carried out a joint missile test with the US in the Mediterranean, leading to heightened tensions in the region.

The firing was part of a  test of Israel’s Arrow defence system.

The country’s defence ministry said the system successfully detected and tracked a Sparrow medium-range guided missile.

Experts say the missile test is a sign Israel is taking seriously the possibility that any US air strikes could lead to retaliatory attacks, either by Syria itself or by its ally, Hezbollah, in Lebanon.

Mr Obama stressed last night that his 
primary objective remained ‘limited and proportional’ attacks to degrade
Syria’s chemical weapons capabilities.

But,
suggesting he plans to boost the rebels to bring about regime change, 
he added: ‘It also fits into a broader strategy that can bring about 
over time the kind of strengthening of the opposition and the 
diplomatic, economic and political pressure required – so that 
ultimately we have a transition that can bring peace and stability, not 
only to Syria but to the region.

‘We have a broader strategy that will 
allow us to upgrade the capabilities of the opposition, allow Syria 
ultimately to free itself from the kinds of terrible civil war, death 
and activity that we’ve been seeing on the ground.’

The
US president’s shift was welcomed by Republican Senator John McCain, 
who offered to help him avoid a humiliating defeat in Congress next week
in exchange for a pledge to do more to back the rebels.

London Mayor Boris Johnson said he believed Congress would back Mr Obama and insisted Parliament should ‘think again’ about UK involvement if Assad was confirmed as being behind the gas attacks.

Mr Cameron said however: ‘Parliament spoke very clearly and it’s important to respect the view of Parliament, so I am not planning to return to Parliament to ask again about British military action.’UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon warned last night any ‘punitive’ action taken against Syria for an alleged chemical weapons attack would be illegal without Security Council approval or a sound case for self-defence.

‘As I have repeatedly said, the Security Council has primary responsibility for international peace and security,’

Ban said. ‘The use of force is lawful only when in exercise of self-defence in accordance with article 51 of the UN Charter and or when the Security Council approves such action.’

He also warned that a military strike against Syria could unleash more turmoil and bloodshed in a crisis that has already killed more than 100,000.
