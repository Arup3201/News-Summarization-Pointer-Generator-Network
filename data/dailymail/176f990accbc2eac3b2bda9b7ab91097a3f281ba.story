'Belle of the ball': April Jones pictured in the purple quilted coat she was wearing when she was snatched from the street near her home on Monday

In the purple quilted coat she was wearing when she was snatched off the street, this is five-year-old April Sue-Lyn Jones.

Her disappearance has stunned the close-knit community in Machynlleth, leaving her distraught parents Coral, 40, and Paul, 43, ‘beside themselves with worry’.

Yesterday, friends and relatives described her as a ‘bubbly, popular little girl’, who liked to wear party dresses and play with her friends.

Just a few days ago, she attended a birthday party at a village hall with 11 other children, where she was described as the ‘belle of the ball’.

Her grandmother Sue Smith last night said: ‘This is a living nightmare – it’s terrible.’ Mrs Smith, 67, who is in constant touch with her daughter, April’s mother, added: ‘April is a lovely little girl with a lovely character. We can only hope she comes back home.’

The child’s godmother Mair Raftree, 41, from Aberystwyth, broke down as she said: ‘She’s lovely. We just want her back. She’s a quiet girl, and an important member of her family. She would never go with anybody and ask for a lift. We just want her back safely.’

She added: ‘I had a phone call from Coral last night at 6.50pm. She said, “April has been kidnapped”. It was a big shock. I asked her if she’d called the police and after the shock had sunk in we drove up to Machynlleth to join the search.’

Mrs Raftree, who has known the family for eight years, said that April’s parents had only recently married and that her older sister Jasmine, 16, joined the hundreds of others who had been helping with the search.

The girls’ brother Harley, ten, bravely went to school yesterday without April.

Fighting back tears, primary school headteacher Gwenfair Glyn said: ‘Harley coped very well. He had his friends look after him all day. I spoke to his father as well to see how they were doing. It’s a very hard time for us all here. Our thoughts are with April’s family.

‘April’s a very bubbly and very valued member of school. She’s a very popular little girl. It’s a very difficult time. We are such a close community here in Machynlleth.

‘Most of the children know about April and what has happened, but it is hard with the little ones who don’t understand. It’s a difficult balance in telling them the truth and preserving their innocence.’

On the evening of her disappearance, April’s mother, a former Laura Ashley factory worker and her father, who does not work because of ill health, had been at a parents’ evening at her school.

Yesterday, Mrs Jones remained at the family’s £165,000 home on the quiet former council estate of Bryn-y-Gog and was said to be ‘afraid to leave’ in case the police had any news as to the whereabouts of her youngest child.

April was playing in front of her house, which is surrounded on three sides by tree-covered hills, at the time of her disappearance. She was with her best friend, a seven-year-old girl, who has given police vital clues in the search for her – including a description of the driver.

Worry: April's disappearance has sparked concern in the local area, as well as further afield across the UK

Neighbours said April and the girl were very close. Grandmother Judy Price, 56, who lives 200 yards away, said: ‘They were always together. I would often see them playing together outside their homes.

‘April is a lovely little thing, always smiling and from a very good and caring home.

‘It makes me feel sick to think where she could be now and what is going through her mind. And everyone is feeling for her mum and dad – they must be going through hell.’

Mother-of-two Rebecca Garrod has a five-year-old daughter in the same class as April.

She said: ‘My daughter and April were at the same birthday party together on Saturday. She was so happy and having such a good time.

‘I have lived here all my life and it has always been a very safe place to live, somewhere where you don’t have to worry about letting your children play outside.

‘I am being more vigilant now about my children. My little one was asking this morning whether April wasn’t coming to school because she is unwell and what will they say when they do the register.’

Family friend Phil Garrod said both of his young daughters were at the birthday party. ‘My youngest is in the same class at school. Where April lives is where all the children play together. It’s a safe environment.’

As police continued to search for April last night, a candle-lit service was held at St Peter’s Church. Priest-in-charge  Kathleen Rogers said: ‘As a community we are facing an awful time and are in a very bad  place. We need time to collect our thoughts and to place April, her family and ourselves in  God’s hands.’
