Cristiano Ronaldo is back on Portugal duty this week ahead of his country's crunch Euro 2016 qualifier clash against Serbia on Sunday night. 

Ronaldo was in the thick of the action at training following Real Madrid's 'El Clasico' defeat by Barcelona on Sunday night. 

The Catalans opened up a four-point lead over their arch rivals at the top of La Liga following their 2-1 victory at the Nou Camp.

The Los Blancos star will have to put that defeat to the back of his mind, however, as Fernando Santos' side gear up for the visit of Serbia.

Ronaldo looked focused during his side's training session at their team base in Lisbon joining fellow team-mates Pepe, Ricardo Quaresma and Vieirinha.

Portugal got their Group I campaign off to an awful start when they were lost 1-0 at home to Albania last September before bouncing back with a 1-0 victory against Denmark the following month.

A narrow 1-0 win against Armenia in November has revived Portugal's Euro bid as they look to keep pace with the Danes at the summit of the group. 

Victory for Portugal on Sunday would stretch their gap over Serbia to eight points after four matches.
