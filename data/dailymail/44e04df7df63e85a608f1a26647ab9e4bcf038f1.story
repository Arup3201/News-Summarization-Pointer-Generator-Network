A volunteer firefighter in Royce City, Texas, has been forced to resign after he killed two dogs and callously boasted about it by posting a photo of their lifeless bodies on Facebook.

Tim Conatser claims he killed the two Labradors after warning their owner, his neighbor, to keep them away from his livestock.

The incident has enraged animal lovers worldwide and now the owner of the dead animals – a black dog called Gordo and a yellow lab called Spike - is denying that Conatser ever approached him to complain about them.

'I'm in shock. I don't know. I don't understand these people. Bad people, I don't know,' Pulido Rodrigo told Fox 4. He said he only found out about the brutal incident via social media.

Criticism of Conatser's actions and even death threats have since poured into tiny Union Valley Volunteer Fire Department from all over the U.S. and as far as western Europe.

However, it's the laws in Hunt County, Texas, that will decide what happens as Constable Terry Jones launches a criminal investigation to determine if what Conatser allegedly did constitutes animal cruelty.

'We've had I don't know how many hits,' fire chief Edward Ragsdale said about the department's social media. 'We've had (them) from as far away as England, Portugal, Canada, every state in the union.'

However, Ragsdale said he can't take responsibility for the grisly Facebook post.

'This is an individual that's a volunteer with our department,' Ragsdale said. 'We can't be responsible for his actions when he's off duty.'

Those actions allegedly include Conatser writing a grammatically confusing yet haunting message to his neighbors along with the unsettling photo.

'Somebody didn't put any truth my warning,' Conatser wrote. 'Keep your damn dogs on your property.'

Conatser, who was suspended from his position with the Union Valley Volunteer Fire Department after his post went viral, has now resigned.

'We do not condone the recent actions of one of our firefighters. We are following our policy in removing him from our department,' the department said it a statement.

Both the Hunt County Constables Office and the SPCA are now investigating to determine if animal cruelty charges should be filed.

Conatser may have been within his rights to shoot the dogs per local law. His friend Kevin Forester told CBSDFW that the trouble began days earlier when Conatser discovered the dogs attacking a calf in his barn.

'So he went over to his neighbor's and told him that his dogs was getting in his barn and attacking his animals, to please - ya know - keep 'em at home, put 'em on a leash, build a fence, do something,' claims Forester.
