A tech wizard who set up a website to help people exploit a booking loophole to get cheap flights has raised $30,000 in donations for his legal battle with United Airlines.

The carrier is suing Aktarer Zaman, 22, for showing thousands of fliers how to employ the 'hidden city' ticketing technique to make substantial savings on their fares.

His website, Skiplagged.com, lets fliers get cheap fares by telling airlines that their final destination is only a stop-over.

Aktarer Zaman, 22, from New York City founded Skiplagged.com last year which used the technique described as 'hidden city' ticketing

This way, some fliers can book a cheap, multi-leg ticket instead of a more expensive direct one - and simply leave the airport part during the stop.

But lawyers for United and travel site Orbitz have said the strategy creates 'unfair competition' and demanded $75,000 from the coder - prompting a flood of online donations from supporters.

A crowdfunding page on the GoFundMe website has so far attracted $27,000 to pay for the legal battle, with donations from 1,360 people.

On the page, Zaman wrote that he is certain his strategy is legal, and that he has attracted United's wrath because they are doing 'too good of a job' saving people money.

He said: 'Skiplagged's sole purpose has always been to help you become savvy travelers.

The site has a method which means customers could get lower fares by booking your final destination as a stop-over

'We have been doing that by exposing pricing inefficiencies for air travel, among other things. 

'Unfortunately, we have been doing too good of a job so United Airlines and Orbitz recently teamed up with a lawsuit to get in the way.

'Everything Skiplagged has done and continues to do is legal, but the only way to effectively prove this is with lawyers. Please show your support for Skiplagged by donating towards this campaign to help fund our legal team.'

On the page, well-wishers wrote of their support alongside the donations.

One, James Heyman, wrote: 'The airlines have no right to complain, it's a system they created.'

Another, Mark Rayson, said: 'This is absurd, with a little investigation online any search engine you can do this yourself. This small company just makes it easier.'

The 'hidden city' technique has existed for years, though Zaman's tool allows consumers to take advantage of it with less work on their part. The website promises reductions of as much as 45 per cent on some routes.

However, the practice is not effective on all routes, and airlines have been known to retaliate by billing customers the difference if they discover the ploy, or removing points from frequent flier accounts.

It often only works for one-way journeys, as some carriers cancel the remaining parts of a booking journey as soon as a passenger misses one step.

Passengers also can't combine the strategy with taking bags in the hold, as they won't be able to get them back during the stopover.  

Zaman, who was born in Bangladesh but grew up in Brooklyn, New York, told CNN that he was expecting the lawsuit.

He insists there is nothing illegal about his website and says he is just exposing an 'inefficiency' in the pricing system.

He told the site: '[Hidden city ticketing] has been around for a while, it just hasn't been very accessible to consumers.'

Zaman is currently working at a tech start-up and says Skiplagged is simply a 'side project'.

Robert Mann, president of R.W. Mann & Company, an airline consulting firm in Port Washington, N.Y,  told the station travellers will still use similar techniques even if the site is shut down.

Michael Boyd, President of Boyd Group International, said he worked for American Airlines as a ticket agent 30 years ago and was trained to look out for 'hidden city' ticket sales.
