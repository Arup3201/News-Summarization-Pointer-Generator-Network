Vanessa-Mae was banned from international skiing for four years yesterday after taking part in fixed races to help her qualify for the Winter Olympics.

The 36-year-old British violinist competed for Thailand, the country of her father’s birth, at the Games in Sochi last February.

She skied under the name Vanessa Vanakorn and said it had been an ‘amazing’ experience despite coming last out of 67 competitors.

But yesterday the Swiss-based International Ski Federation (FIS) said it had found ‘violations’ in her results from a hastily staged event in Slovenia held days before the deadline for Olympic qualification.

It said that without the cheating she would not have achieved the points needed to be eligible to ski in the Games.

Officials are said to have invented times for skiers who did not race and faked times for skiers who did not finish.

They also broke rules by not changing the course design between the first and second runs, and allowing skiers to continue in poor weather which required abandonment.

Five officials involved in the event at Krvavec in Slovenia have been banned by FIS.

It is unclear if Thai Olympic officials were involved or if they will face IOC sanctions. The FIS said: ‘The competitions were organised at the request of the management of Vanessa Vanakorn, through the Thai Olympic Committee.’ FIS president Gian Franco Kasper said: ‘Those who have been sanctioned have been sanctioned for good reason.’

Cheater, cheater: Vanessa-Mae, who competed for Thailand as Vanessa Vanakorn, finished last of 67 racers in the two-run giant slalom in Sochi, almost a minute slower than the winner

The International Olympic Committee declined to comment on details of the case until possible appeals are completed.

Last night Vanessa-Mae was unavailable for comment.

But if she does harbour dreams of another Olympic appearance, she may be disappointed. It is thought the ban would prevent her from competing at the next Winter Olympics in South Korea in 2018.

The classical music star was born in Singapore to Thai and Chinese parents and moved to England at the age of four.

Shortly after finishing the Games in February, she said: ‘With my limited experience – I only started training six months ago – I’m just glad I made it down.’
