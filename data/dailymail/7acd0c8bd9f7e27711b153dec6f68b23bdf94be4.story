She may not have made it to the store's launch but Victoria Beckham has proven that she is no fair-weather business woman when it comes to her shop.

The 40-year-old designer was spotted visiting her Dover Street store in London's Mayfair again today.

Her namesake store opened it's doors four days ago to an incredibly eager crowd and since being back in the UK, Victoria has found it hard to keep away from her beloved boutique.

Victoria Beckham has made her second visit to her newly opened boutique 

Victoria made her first trip to the store on Saturday having flown in from America less than 24-hours before hand.

After her arrival the mother-of-four, tweeted: 'So excited to visit my store today! Thank u to my wonderful team and customers I met today!! X vb .'

Her store opened its doors on Thursday but on the day Victoria was unavailable to attend and David Beckham made an appearance in her place.

You'd be mistaken for thinking that has been  putting her feet up. Her delayed arrival to the shop was due to  the fact that she was delivering a UN speech in New York as part of her role as a Goodwill Ambassador.

Since her return Victoria has made it her business to stay on top of her business. Today in true Posh Spice style, despite the rain, she arrived at the store in suede shoe-boots and sunglasses.

Her outfit choice was slightly more subtle than her first visit to the store where Victoria wore a statement leopard print skirt that came in at a hefty £4000. Today the mother-of-three wore a simple white shirt and full black skirt to demonstrate her professional attitude.

While Victoria was away her family were sure to step in and keep an eye on the store. Her former footballer husband David Beckham was drawing a crowd after making a welcome appearance at her 6,000sq ft store launch.

David wasn't the only family member keen to support Victoria since the launch. Her eldest son Brooklyn, 15, seemed proud of his mum as he visited the store yesterday.

He appeared to be following in his mother's fashionable footsteps with his hair quiffed into a slicked up do, he topped off the look with a pair of designer shades and patterned trainers.

The luxury boutique – Victoria’s first foray into retail – has eschewed convention, embracing instead a minimalist look, with no cash registers, no display window and no rails.  

Speaking to MailOnline about the unique space shortly before its opening, Victoria said: 'It’s the first time people can see the brand through my eyes.

‘I didn’t want a traditional shop window, just a plain window, and a huge concrete sliding door.

‘The floors weren't connected, and I said, “Wouldn’t it be incredible to drill a hole through all three floors, so you could stand on the top floor and see the ground floor.”'

She added: ‘I didn’t think it would be possible, but it was.’

Victoria's store is not for those on a shoe-string budget with the cheapest items coming in at £150 for a keyring. And Victoria wanted the rest of her store to reflect the aspirational feel of her clothing line. 

She continued: ‘We’re not going to have any ugly tills anywhere,’ Victoria explained. ‘Payment is with an iPad, so we can go to the customer on whatever floor she’s on.’
