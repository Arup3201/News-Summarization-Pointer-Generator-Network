Four teams of architects presented plans Wednesday for a reimagined Penn Station that would be a spacious, welcoming gateway to New York City instead of the crowded, confusing and dark transportation hub now used by hundreds of thousands of daily commuters.

The four firms that took part in a design challenge sponsored by The Municipal Art Society all said the only way to improve Penn Station would be to move Madison Square Garden from its current home atop the train station.

John Fantillas of H3 Hardy Collaboration Architecture said the arena crowds the station 'like three fat men in a rowboat.'

Futuristic visions: Four teams of architects have presented plans for a reimagined Penn Station, This is Skidmore, Owings and Merrill's proposed design.

Lots of light: This is Diller, Scofidio and Renfro's proposed design for Penn Station, which would let in more light than the current design

Historic station: Train tracks run under the James A. Farley Post Office building, center, before reaching Penn Station, which sits under the familiar circular Madison Square Garden, center back

New look: The new designs aim to revamp and brighten the aging train station

Roger Duffy of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill called Penn Station 'a disaster' and said his firm has imagined 'a magnificent future' for the area with Madison Square Garden moved just to the southwest of its current location.

Madison Square Garden called the plans 'pie-in-the-sky drawings.'

'It's curious to see that there are so many ideas on how to tear down a privately owned building that is a thriving New York icon, supports thousands of jobs and is currently completing a $1 billion transformation,' the company said in a statement.

The design challenge was prompted by an upcoming vote by New York's City Council on renewing Madison Square Garden's permit to operate on top of Penn Station.

The proposal by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) incorporates glass walls and skylights so that even 'from the tracks you know where you are.'

Another alternative: SOM aims to move MSG to a spot just south of the Farley Building, on Eighth Avenue between 30th and 31st streets

Madison Square Garden wants the 
permit renewed in perpetuity, while the city Planning Commission is 
recommending a 15-year limit. The Municipal Art Society and some other 
civic groups want the permit renewed for 10 years.

In
addition to H3 Hardy and Skidmore, Owings & Merriill, architects of
the under-construction 1 World Trade Center, the firms that presented 
new Penn Station designs were Diller Scofidio + Renfro, which has worked
on the High Line and renovating Lincoln Center, and SHoP Architects, 
one of the firms that designed the Barclays Center arena in Brooklyn.

They offered plans for an airy, light-filled Penn Station with shops, rooftop gardens and other amenities.

H3 would upzone plots
all along Seventh Avenue to make way for tall office towers, four of 
which would occupy the four corners of the Penn Station site

A three-acre roof garden would sit on top of the station, while all of the train lines would use the multi-layered structure whose centerpiece would be an airy 120-foot-high main hall with skylights

The H3 plan would connect MSG to the rest of the city via an elevated walkway for pedestrians and cyclists called the water line

New home for MSG: H3 Hardy Collaboration Architecture's plan involves relocating Madison Square Garden to a built-out pier along the Hudson River to the west of the Javits Center

Elizabeth Diller of Diller Scofidio + Renfro called her firm's 'city within a city' design 'a large sponge-like mass aerated in many directions.'

Some plans envisioned paying for the upgrades by replacing existing buildings in the Penn Station complex with new mixed-use skyscrapers.

Madison Square Garden, home to the Knicks, the Rangers and the WNBA's Liberty as well as a venue for concerts and other events, would be moved due west to a pier on the Hudson River under the H3 Hardy plan. The SHoP plan would place it a few blocks to the south and west in the Morgan mail processing facility.

Big changes: The four firms that took part in a design challenge all said the only way to improve Penn Station would be to move Madison Square Garden from its current home atop the train station

Relocations: 'Penn Station cannot move and the Garden can,' SHoP's Vishaan Chakrabarti said in a phone interview. 'Right now everything's piled on top of everything'

Funding: Some plans envisioned paying for the upgrades by replacing existing buildings in the Penn Station complex with new mixed-use skyscrapers

'Penn Station cannot move and the Garden can,' SHoP's Vishaan Chakrabarti said in a phone interview. 'Right now everything's piled on top of everything.'

Diller Scofidio + Renfro's plan puts the Garden in the back part of the Farley building directly west of Penn Station.

Madison Square Garden said an earlier plan to move the arena to that spot 'collapsed for a number of reasons that did not involve MSG, but did involve many of the same people now pressuring MSG to move, including The Municipal Art Society, which created enormous obstacles to achieving the relocation.'

City within a city: Diller Scofidio + Renfro took a more philosophical approach, making much of the idea that a new Penn could be 'a city within a city'

Diller Scofidio + Renfro envisions Penn Station as 'a large sponge-like mass, aerated from every angle'

With MSG moved to behind the Farley building on Ninth Avenue, there's room for a variety of spaces, from a spa to a micro theater to a cascading park

Inside the station, Diller Scofidio + Renfro envision drifting food vendors carrying their wares around their waist like at a baseball stadium

Also imagined are train arrival and departure times that would be projected onto the floor and real-time video footage of trains approaching and leaving the station aired onto a large screen

Its statement concluded, 'The fact that this exercise does not include anyone who actually has detailed knowledge of this issue or understands the realities of this complex project exposes this exercise for exactly what it is.'

The architects said they would hope to work with the owners of the arena to the benefit of all parties.

'Madison Square Garden should not take this study as an affront,' Charles Renfro of Diller Scofidio + Renfro said in interview. 'They should be heartened by the fact that no one wanted to get rid of Madison Square Garden entirely or move it very far from its current home.'
