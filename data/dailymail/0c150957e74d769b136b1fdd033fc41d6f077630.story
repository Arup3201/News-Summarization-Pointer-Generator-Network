Advertising and PR managers, event planners, and education administrators are all titles which are considered the ‘best’ jobs for women in 2014.

According to a new study based on data from the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, which ranked the top 12 'best' jobs for women this year, dental hygienists and physical therapists are also rated highly as female-driven jobs.

The top 12, which is listed alphabetically rather than ranked in order, was compiled by CareerCast, and is based chiefly on the average salaries women can expect to earn in various jobs, coupled with each professions’ 'projected hiring outlook' - but it also takes into account factors including stress, physical demands and the percentage of women working in each field.

Female-friendly careers: CareerCast has ranked its take on the top 12 'best' jobs for women in 2014, based on average salaries and the 'projected hiring outlook' for various professions in the U.S.

At the top of the salary scale - just one deciding factor - was the role of an advertising and promotions manager, which earns women an average salary of $115,750. The projected hiring outlook however - calculated by comparing the number of women in that job in 2012 to the expected number in 2022 - is relatively low, at 12per cent.

Physical therapy, on the other hand, is described as 'an especially promising' profession, with a projected hiring outlook of 36per cent, and an average salary of $79,860.

At the lower end of the salary scale is event planning, with an average expectation of $45,810 a year, but with a high projected hiring outlook of 33per cent. The study also points out that 74.7per cent of event planners are women; a factor that pushed certain professions up the scale.

Other job titles which women appear to dominate in terms of numbers versus men, according to the figures, include speech pathologists (93.4per cent of whom are female), dental hygienists, (98.3per cent) and occupational therapists (88.4per cent).

A job as a computers systems analyst, with a salary of $79,680, was also hailed as promising, for being 'one of many fast-growing jobs where gender takes a back seat to skill, experience and passion.'

Other jobs on the list in which women are reported to be earning 'compensation comparable to their male counterparts' include human resource managers, education administrators and actuaries.

To look purely at women's salaries and the issue of the gender pay gap, Forbes recently published a list - also using data from the Bureau of Labor and Statistics - which ranks the top 20 'best-paying' jobs for women in 2014.

The most lucrative job title was found to be chief executive. Although female chief executives make an average salary of $94,172, they only make up only 21per cent of the profession in total, and earn 20per cent less than men at exactly the same level - which closely reflects the current average gender pay gap across all professions in the U.S.

CareerCast's top 12 list of best jobs for women has drawn some criticism based on its subjective nature. Refinery29 considers: 'The angle of which jobs are best “for women” is offensive no matter what positions are listed,' and points out that none of the jobs listed reach $100k, or surpass middle-management level.

On a lighter note, regardless of skill-set, more and more women in today's America are choosing entrepreneurship as a career path.

The U.S. Small Business Administration estimates that last year, 10.6 million women owned their own businesses, a significant jump from the 1990s, the study points out.
