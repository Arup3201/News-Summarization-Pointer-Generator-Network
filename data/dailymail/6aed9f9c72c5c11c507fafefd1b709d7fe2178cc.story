The embattled former First Lady of Oregon has compared herself to Monica Lewisnky in a Facebook post in which she blasted the media for turning 'public humiliation into a commodity and shame into an industry.'

Cylvia Hayes' fiancé John Kitzhaber was forced to resign as governor in February over allegations that he helped steer business to her environmental consulting firm and then cover up the activity.

The couple are now facing federal corruption investigations from both the FBI and IRS - though no charges have been levied.

Hayes compared her own public humiliation with that of Monic Lewinsky, who spoke out about having her life laid bare following revelations of her affair with President Bill Clinton 

On Tuesday, Hayes posted a link to a TED Talk by Lewinsky called 'The Price of Shame' in which the infamous former White House intern says criticizes the 'rush to judgement' in the media over revelations of her affair with President Bill Clinton.

'Overnight I went from being a completely private figure to a publicly humiliated one worldwide,' Lewinsky says. 

Hayes shared the link with the comment: 'I am so appreciative of her for taking this on. 

'This is a powerful statement about how our click-for-cash media business model has turned public humiliation into a commodity and shame into an industry.'

It was Hayes' first time speaking out since her fiancé's resignation on on February. 

She also tweeted out a link to an apology written by a Politico reporter who accused two Secret Service agents of crashing into a barricade while drunk outside the White House. The details of that incident remain unclear.

This is the latest example of Hayes and Kitzhaber blaming the media for being forced out of the governor's office. 

When he resigned Kitzhaber, who has just won a fourth term as governor, blasted the press - saying, 'it is deeply troubling to me to realize that we have come to a place in the history of this great state of ours where a person can be charged, tried, convicted and sentenced by the media with no due process and no independent verification of the allegations involved.'
