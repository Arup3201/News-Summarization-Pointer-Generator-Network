They’re here. The mad set of Besiktas supporters to descend on north London have arrived in their thousands, ready to show Tottenham exactly what European football ought to feel like.

Kick-off: Thursday October 2, 8.05pm

TV: ITV/ITV4 HD.

The flock of banners, flares and unified war cries in that pocket of White Hart Lane should make it a night to savour. The travelling Turks are not AEL Limassol, Tromso or FC Sheriff – they have rocked up for points and bring a squad capable of doing some serious damage. That’s exactly why Spurs should treat this as a Champions League dress rehearsal.

Demba Ba will lead the line with former Arsenal midfielder Oguzhan Ozyakup pulling strings behind him. It should pose quite a test, serving as a barometer to how far Spurs have come and the extent to which they still have to go under Mauricio Pochettino.

Demba Ba is yet to open his account for the Turkish side but could pose a big threat to Spurs on Thursday

There is a bedding in process with the new manager at the helm – Spurs play in a different fashion to the designs laid out by Tim Sherwood before he was unceremoniously dumped – and it will take a period of time before the Argentine cracks the problems to have blighted the club for the past three years.

Pochettino is on his way to doing so, but Daniel Levy’s Champions League target looks to be a struggle in terms of qualifying domestically. While they have the ability to finish in the top four, history suggests they won’t.

That means the road to Warsaw brings added importance. Direct qualification into the continent’s premier competition by winning the secondary event should see Tottenham take this very seriously indeed.

Besiktas offer an authentic alternative to Champions League football. It is an evening whereby Spurs should be testing themselves to beat a main rival in the group and lay down a marker, but also having to play the situation too. You come up against Slaven Bilic, his touchline entourage and thousands of baying travellers.

Bilic’s side worried Arsenal in August and should cause problems; other than the 1-0 second leg defeat at the Emirates Stadium they are unbeaten this season.

But the most important factor to this is the atmosphere, the sense of meaning. Spurs will not turn up, win 3-0 with little bother and go home. 

Besiktas are loud, proud and create an intimidating air wherever they play. Their supporters will expect to offer more than Galatasaray managed at the Emirates on Wednesday.

The intensity should replicate the big European nights of 2010. Spurs fans will remember Inter Milan 3-1 under the lights and with a ferocious full house. AC Milan in the last-16 the year after too.

They have floundered for too long since then - bought badly while chopping and changing.

Now they are ready to settle. And the big games suit the club, according to Younes Kaboul. ‘If we play the same way we did at Arsenal, we should have no problems, but we need to repeat that. We have set the tone,’ he said.

It’s high time that Levy found a way back into the Champions League. There won’t be a better opportunity to set that tone than against Besiktas.
