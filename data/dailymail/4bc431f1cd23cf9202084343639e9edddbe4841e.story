Once known for breaking the news, Queen Letizia of Spain is now more accustomed to making it but it seems she hasn't forgotten her reporting roots.

Already a patron of a number of Spanish charities dedicated to the Press, the Spanish Queen last night showed her support for the profession once again - this time by attending a journalism awards ceremony.

Resplendent in a shimmering sequinned top and a neat pair of tailored trousers, the 42-year-old looked wonderful as she arrived at the Ritz Hotel for the Francisco Cerecedo journalism awards on the arm of her dapper husband King Felipe, 46.

All smiles: Letizia, 42, a former journalist herself, has long been a supporter of charities dedicated to the Press

Letizia, whose father Jesús José Ortiz Álvarez and stepmother Ana Togores are both journalists, enjoyed a lengthy career in TV and newspapers before marrying Felipe in 2004.

After a stint at Asturian daily paper, La Nueva España, she went on to work for ABC, a popular national newspaper that enjoys the third largest circulation in Spain.

Next came a stint at Spanish news agency EFE before a move to Guadalajara in Mexico saw her take on a role on local paper, Siglo 21. 

Back in Spain a year later, she worked for the Spanish version of Bloomberg, a news channel and agency specialising in economics, before moving to CNN+.

By the time she met her husband-to-be, Letizia was working for popular TV channel 24 Horas, where along with anchoring the popular Telediario 2 evening news bulletin, she reported on a wide range of breaking news events, among them the 2000 US presidential elections and the 9/11 attacks.

Perhaps as a result of her reporting background, Letizia is one of the most enthusiastically pro-newspaper royals in Europe and regularly turns out for journalist charities and awards ceremonies.

By contrast, Prince Philip is notoriously mistrustful of the media and once quipped to the matron of a Caribbean hospital he was visiting: 'You have mosquitoes. I have the Press!'

When asked by Guardian journalist Polly Toynbee whether he read the paper during a Buckingham Palace reception, an affronted Prince Philip allegedly replied: 'No fear!'

Dislike: Prince Philip is notoriously mistrustful of journalists and once likened the Press to mosquitoes

Privacy concerns: Prince William is extremely protective of his wife and son's privacy

Others to complain about the Press include Prince Harry and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - all of whom have run into difficulty with the international media.

Prince William, who recently threatened a pair of photographers with legal action after they were spotted taking photos of Prince George, is fiercely protective of his - and his wife's - privacy.

Although the British media has agreed to follow guidelines set by the Palace, foreign newspapers have printed a slew of controversial images, among them one taken as a gust of wind blew the Duchess' skirt up in Australia.

Most notorious of all was an incident in which a French paparazzi photographer took photos of a sunbathing Duchess as she relaxed outside a secluded farmhouse from a road a mile away using a long lens.

The resulting pictures, which were then published by the French version of Closer magazine in September 2012, left Prince William furious and he later took legal action against the offending photographer for invasion of privacy.
