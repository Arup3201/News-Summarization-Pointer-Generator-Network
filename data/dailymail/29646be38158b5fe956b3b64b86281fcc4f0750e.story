It’s certainly a novel way of seeing the city sights - if you’re brave enough to balance tens of metres above the ground, that is.

World Champion slack liners gathered from around the globe at the International Urban Highline Festival in Lublin, Poland, to enjoy the daring sport.

Some of the pictures give the illusion of the slack liners walking across the city horizon at sunset as people cheer them along the daring highline.

These thrilling pictures were taken by professional photographer Lukasz Warzecha, 29, who was visiting the fourth annual event for the first time this month.

The Polish photographer, who is based in the UK, specialises in adventure photography and spotted the moment that some successfully make it all the way across - and others who don't.

He said: ‘It's the biggest highline festival in the world and it's such a unique event.

‘It was quite breathtaking to see for the first time.

'There were hundreds of people there and they would cheer as the walkers reached the end or gasp if they fell off.

‘It was the first time I'd been and it was a great atmosphere.

‘I've seen highline walkers in the countryside before, but never in an old city like this.

‘We went up to the rooftops to take some really great pictures.

‘When you see people walking across the skyline - it's pretty breathtaking.’

The highlines were around 50 metres long, with walkers tethered to the line with a harness around their waist, or kept safe by netting installed below.
