President Obama has announced a spend of more than $1 billion in early childhood education through public-private partnerships.

He described it as 'one of the best investments we can make' during a daylong summit at the White House on Wednesday.

To highlight the importance of educating children in their first five years, Jennifer Garner, Julianne Moore, John Legend and Shakira have been picked to narrate a series of new 60-second public service announcements. 

These adverts, which end with the tagline 'when we invest in them, we invest in us', were played during the conference.

Obama noted that only 28per cent of four-year-olds were enrolled in state-funded preschools nationwide last year, blaming high costs for such low numbers.

He said studies repeatedly show that children who are educated early in life are more likely to finish their educations, avoid the criminal justice system, hold good jobs and have stable families. 

All those factors are good for the U.S. and its economy overall, Obama said. 

Referencing his own teenage daughters, he continued: 'We've got kids in this country who are every bit as talented as Malia and Sasha but they're starting out the race a step behind.'

He said the investments will help level the playing field.

Education Secretary Arne Duncan said during a morning panel discussion on how to pump more investment into early learning that a lot needs to be done.

The panelists, including a local sheriff from Ohio, agreed that spending more money on early education can have significant lifetime effects such as reducing crime and teen pregnancy and increasing future earnings for those who went to preschool. 

At the summit, 18 states are being awarded a total of $250 million in Education Department grants to create or expand high-quality preschool programs. 

Those states are: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont and Virginia. 

In all, 36 states had applied for the grant money.

Another $500 million from the Health and Human Services Department is being sent to more than 40 states to expand Early Head Start and child care programs for youngsters from birth to three years old.

The White House said about 63,000 children would benefit from the federal dollars, which officials said already have been appropriated by Congress.

Words of wisdom: Obama described early childhood education as 'one of the best investments we can make' during a daylong White House summit on Wednesday

Grounded: He said studies repeatedly show that children who are educated early in life are more likely to finish their educations, avoid the criminal justice system, hold good jobs and have stable families 

On top of the federal money is another $330 million from dozens of corporations, foundations and individuals. 

That money is part of a new campaign called Invest in US.

The effort being led by the First Five Years Fund will challenge the private and public sectors to spend more on early childhood education. 

Among those supporting the campaign are The Walt Disney Co. with $55 million, the LEGO Foundation with $5 million and the J.B. and M.K. Pritzker Family Foundation with $25 million.

'That's real money,' Obama said. 'Even in Washington, that's real money.'

Obama pushed for an expansion of early education opportunities in his State of the Union address in 2013, and again in 2014 after his call got little traction in Congress. 

At the summit, he called on the new Republican-controlled Congress that will be seated next year to 'work with me to make pre-K available for all of our kids.'

During the summit, the First Five Years Fund also previewed the new celebrity-narrated public service announcements.

The Associated Press previewed the announcements before their release.
