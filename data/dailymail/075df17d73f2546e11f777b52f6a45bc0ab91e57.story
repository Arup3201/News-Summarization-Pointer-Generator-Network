A teen foot fetishist, who was charged along with two men for having underage sex with girls and posting videos on social media, has been released on bond - and is already back on Twitter.

'Porn diva' Bianca Byndloss, 19, of Miami, posted bail last Friday on underage sex charges related to girls aged 12, 13 and 14. By Saturday, she was back on social media, tweeting: 'I love my career I hope this doesn't interfere with my dreams but only time will tell. #blessup for me peeps much love!'

Byndloss allegedly drove the underage girls to 18-year-old Christian Hernandez’s house last Wednesday and had group sex while being filmed by Bryan Yanes, also 18, investigators said.

Bianca Byndloss, 19, tweeted this message on Saturday, a day after bonding out of jail on sex with minors charges

The trio had consensual sex with the minors while filming the acts, according to an arrest report cited by the Miami Herald.

A video posted online of the sex acts led to someone reporting the teenagers to police.

Footage
 of two of the underage girls performing oral sex on each other, a close
 up of one of the young girl’s genitals and various other pictures and 
videos of the encounter were also discovered on Hernandez’s cell phone, 
police told WTVJ.

The porn diva bailed out of Miami-Dade County Jail on Friday after posting a $37,500 bond.

Byndloss posted a series of messages on Saturday which appeared to relate to her criminal charges - a move which could result in harsher penalties for the accused.

In a string of messages, she wrote: 'It happens all the time when wounds bring you down but don't let it break your determination.'

She also posted: 'God knows I'm humble. I'm loving and caring... fun leads to trouble just live and learn.'

'Life is too previous and beautiful to have it taken away,' she added.

A self-proclaimed ‘porn diva,’ Byndloss 
promotes herself on Twitter and Tumblr. She advertises foot 
fetish sex shows that she performs via Skype in exchange for money.

Byndloss’ Tumblr page shows her sticking her own foot in her mouth, licking her toes and performing a number of sex acts with her size five feet.

She was charged last Thursday with lewd and lascivious battery of a minor and promoting sexual performance of a child.

Hernandez faces the same charges as Byndloss. Yates was charged with lewd and lascivious battery on a minor.
