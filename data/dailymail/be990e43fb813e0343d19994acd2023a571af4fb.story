Police are probing whether a glamorous Russian model was killed by her photographer husband because she infected him with AIDS.

The naked body of 28-year-old Yulia Loshagina was found in woodland in the Ural mountains in Russia, her neck broken and face disfigured by burning.

Her wounds were so severe that her body could only be identified by DNA.

Fairytale romance: Dmitry Loshagin and Yulia Loshagina met on a photo shoot in India and he proposed on the spot

Her photographer husband, Dmitry Loshagin, 37, was arrested in Yekaterinburg, Russia's fourth largest city.

He is currently being held as police investigate whether he was involved in the gruesome murder following a rooftop party at their £1million loft penthouse.

Other guests who were at the party reported that Loshagina appeared to become distressed.

Detectives said postmortem tests showed that the dead model was HIV positive, according to Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper.

'One version is that Dmitry Loshagin became so furious when he learned that his wife infected him with AIDS that he killed her. Police are investigating if this version is correct,' reported the newspaper.

He told a judge at a hearing in Pervouralsk - after which his remand in custody was renewed - that the accusations against him are 'baseless' and he denied any guilt in her murder. 'I loved my wife,' he said.

Unconfirmed local reports say investigators found evidence that his mobile phone was registered close to where her body was found at a lonely sport 23 miles west of the Yekaterinburg.

Her tragic end is a far cry from the love affair between the leading local photographer - known for his pictures of Urals oligarchs - and one of the region's most prominent models.

They fell in love on a shoot in India when he photographed her in a bridal dress - and proposed on the spot. The couple wed two years ago.

'When I saw her in a wedding dress on the back of an elephant in the Indian jungle, I went to her and proposed," he previously disclosed.

''I want to look at the world through your eyes', I said to her then.

Top model: Yulia quickly became her husband's favourite subject for photo shoots

'I want to grow old with you, and I want to walk on the beach and hold your hand.'

She agreed instantly and has since become his favourite model, with many of his pictures of her appearing in Russian glossy magazines.

Yulia disappeared on 22 August and her frantic family launched an immediate search, calling friends and acquaintances.

Despite her absence, say her relatives, he continued working normally.

Yulia's brother Mikhail, said: "He simply didn't bother to start looking for her. First he told us that Yulia left in the middle of the night, taking his car. Then he claimed that his car suddenly re-appeared under their window.

Behind the scenes: Friends who were at the party the night Yulia disappeared said she seemed very distressed and locked her husbands and guests out on the roof

'I got simply fed up and went to police, claiming my sister disappeared and we suspected had something happened to her.

'He constantly changes his story. He didn't think to call police to check the car which Yulia allegedly took for fingerprints. Why?  He refuses to take a polygraph test. I think it means he's got things to hide.'

At the party, she had locked her husband and other guests on the roof until a janitor released them.

When her body was found several days after she went missing, Mikhail claimed he was too busy to go and identify her. Mikhail claimed that he texted: 'Busy, at picture presentation right now.'

In the days after her death, he put their penthouse flat in Yekaterinburg on sale for £1 million.

He was arrested as he sought to leave 'on a business trip', confirmed police.

'Police will do everything in our power to find the murderer as soon as possible," said a source.

'We detained Yulia's husband. He has not been charged with murder, but we are investigating if he could have been involved.'

His supporters say it is 'impossible' that he killed her and are demanding his release.

He once said of her: 'I really love the partnership I have with Yulia. I know I can 100 per cent rely on her. Whatever happens to me, I know she will come and pick me up, however deep I sink.'

Trust: Loshagin once said of his wife 'I know I can 100 per cent rely on her'
