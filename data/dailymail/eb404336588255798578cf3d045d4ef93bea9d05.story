A young mother who loved the TV show The Only Way is Essex has run away to Syria with her baby son after becoming obsessed with extremist propaganda she found online.

Tareena Shakil, 25 – a one-time Spice Girls fan, school prefect and Girl Guide – was so fascinated with the ITV reality show that she travelled 150 miles to buy clothes at a shop run by one of its stars.

Yesterday her parents said she was wearing items she bought there when she set off for Syria, lying to her family that she was taking her 14-month-old son on holiday to Spain.

'We can't come back': Tareena Shakil, 25, pictured with 14-month-old Zaheem, has run away to Syria after becoming obsessed with extremist propaganda she found online

In terrifying messages home, she told them ‘so many people died’ when they ‘got shot at the border’ but that she and her son Zaheem made it because she ‘ran across’.

It is feared Miss Shakil plans to marry a jihadi in the Islamic State stronghold of Raqqa, in the latest case of a British Muslim woman joining the group that murdered UK hostages Alan Henning and David Haines.

Her father Mohammed Shakil, 42, said: ‘We are absolutely distraught that our beautiful, bright, intelligent daughter has chosen this path. I have never cried so much in my life and would do anything to have her and our grandson back in our arms.’

Miss Shakil grew up in Burton-on-Trent in Staffordshire.

‘Tareena did drama and was in the Guides,’ her father told The Sun. ‘She loved the Spice Girls and TOWIE.’

Mr Shakil said she did a psychology degree and got married, although she later divorced.

But around four months ago she set up a Facebook page under the name Tameena al Amirah and started posting extremist messages, including images of Islamist fighters and the IS black flag, and calling herself a ‘slave to Allah’.

Last week she set off with Zaheem, telling her family she was going to Spain. In reality she bought a ticket to Turkey, from where she crossed the porous border into Syria.

‘There was no reason to suspect,’ her father said. ‘She left wearing jeans and a top she bought in a shop owned by one of the TOWIE stars. My little grandson shouldn’t be going through this.’

Miss Shakil has told her family she is in Raqqa and can never return. One message reads: ‘I can’t come back there now … we can’t. Tell her don’t cry. Read the Koran, I love you mummy!’

Of her journey, she wrote: ‘So many people died coming. They got shot at the border. But we made it. We ran across the border in the blazing sun.’

At their housing association home in Burton-on-Trent yesterday, Mr Shakil and his wife Mandy, 47, were too upset to discuss the news.

But in a statement, her father said: ‘We brought Tareena up in a Western environment, while respecting the culture of Islam, and hoped that she would take the best of both worlds.’

Mr Shakil, who has served a prison sentence for dealing drugs, said: ‘I, myself, have made mistakes in the past but it never affected that close, deep bond that exists in special father-and-his-daughter relationships. Like any father, I just want the best for my daughter.

‘We want her to know how much we love her and want her back safely as soon as possible.’

Mr Shakil was jailed for 28 months in 2011 after police stopped his car and found crack cocaine, heroin and mobile phones he used to deal drugs. 

He admitted possessing a knife. His son Tazeem, 22, featured regularly in a local paper which dubbed him ‘Burton’s most prolific persistent young offender’, with 20 convictions and an Asbo by age 14. 

Around four months ago, Tareena Shakil set up a Facebook page under the name Tameena al Amirah and started posting extremist messages

Aged 17, it reported he had ‘turned over a new leaf’ and started work at a local firm, but three years later he was jailed for crashing a car into a house and fleeing the scene while banned from driving.

The couple have two younger children. Local MP Andrew Griffiths said he would do ‘whatever he could’ to help the family.

‘I think this news will have shocked everyone across Burton,’ he said. ‘We now need to ensure this does not happen to others.’ 

Miss Shakil’s disappearance is being investigated by West Midlands Police as she is thought to have been living in Birmingham.

A spokesman said: ‘A 25-year-old woman from Sparkbrook was reported missing by a member of her family on October 24.

'We have since been working to establish the woman’s whereabouts and that she is safe and well. One of our lines of enquiry is that she may have travelled to Syria via Turkey.’

She is the latest young woman to travel to Syria to join Islamic State, apparently as a ‘jihadi bride’.

X-Factor fan Yusra Hussien, 15, flew to Turkey in September with a 17-year-old girl she met online. They are thought to be in Syria.

Twins Salma and Zahra Halane, 16, who hoped to become doctors, also ran away from their home in Manchester to Syria, where social media posts show them learning to use assault rifles.
