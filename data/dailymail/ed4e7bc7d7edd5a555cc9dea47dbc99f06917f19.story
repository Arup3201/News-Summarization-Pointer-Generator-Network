Triple killer Joanna Dennehy's 7ft 3in
 accomplice called her his 'devil in the flesh' and said having sex with
 her was a 'dream never to come true' in twisted letters from his cell.

The praise for her 'bloodthirsty' leanings and 'dirty and dark mind' appears to destroy Gary Stretch's court claims that he only helped the mother-of-two's murder spree because he feared her.

Dennehy, 31, received the letters in her cell while the pair were awaiting sentence - before sending them on to Stretch's ex-partner Julie Gibbons, 53.

Stretch, 48, finishes one letter: 'See
 you really soon. Your biggest supporter! Love you always. Love 
Undertaker xxxxxxx Hubby 4 Lifey'.

In another of the five letters, revealed in the Daily Mirror,
 he writes: 'So looking forward to seeing you babe, well your sexy smile
 and thoughs evil eyes of yours oops evil ment to angeleyes (lmfao).'

Stretch
 was jailed for life for two counts of attempted murder and preventing 
the burial of three people after he was convicted of helping Dennehy 
murder three men in 10 days.

He shouted ‘thank you very much’ after being told he would serve a minimum of 19 years.

Dennehy was handed a whole-life prison term last month, only the third ever given to a woman.

Miss
 Gibbons - who was sent the love notes by Dennehy accompanied by a 
letter in which the killer said 'an apology would be pointless' - said 
they undermine Stretch's claims that he acted out of fear.

Throughout
 the trial Stretch's lawyers said his huge size could not stop him being
 afraid of Dennehy and what she might do to him.

you can always count on me no matter wat my devil in the flesh, I just wish Id got the chance to really show u how much I loved you.

THE DRIVE

Weapon: A knife used by Dennehy, of Peterborough, to murder three people and stab another two people

But
 Stretch was convicted after a trial in which jurors saw CCTV images of 
him walking hand-in-hand with Dennehy through a motorway service 
station.

Dennehy's letter to Stretch's ex-partner, revealed yesteday, read: ‘Mrs Stretch, I have received your letter.

‘I would like to set a matter to rest. Gary did not go along with me out of fear for you.'

'Mine
 and Gary’s relationship was not based on past background. I had no idea
 you even existed until in court my legal team informed me of a recorded
 phone call to you.

‘Not
 long after meeting Gary I made it clear I was not the sort of person 
one should pursue, he chose otherwise. The Gary I know, love and respect
 seems to differ from yours.

'I love Gaz and contrary to what he tells you he has strong feelings for me'

‘I told him a million times to get away from me and the situation but he flat out refused and got annoyed with me when I did.

‘I
 had reasons for my actions and your view of me is understandable, but 
wrong. I tried my hardest to prove I’d manipulated him, but if you know 
him as well as you say you do you will know Gary has his own mind.

During the trial, prosecutors said 
Dennehy 'cast a spell' over her alleged accomplices and some of her 
victims as she killed 'for fun'.

Deaths: John Chapman (left) and Kevin Lee (right) were both killed in Peterborough by Dennehy last March

Stabbed: Dennehy 'exploded' into violence last March, first killing friend Lukasz Slaboszewski, 31, after luring him to a house by text

Scene: The house (right) in Orton Goldhay, Peterborough, where Joanna Dennehy killed John Chapman

She
 was likened to 'Uma Thurman from Kill Bill and the woman from the 
Terminator' by married father-of-two Mr Lee shortly before his death.

At
 the height of a nationwide man-hunt, she bragged to one witness that 
she had killed eight people - although no further murders have been 
detected.

Dennehy pleaded guilty to three counts of murder, two of attempted murder and three of preventing the lawful and decent burials of her three victims.

Two other accomplices were also jailed.

Robert Moore, 56, was jailed for three years after he admitted sheltering Dennehy and Leslie Layton, 36, was jailed for 14 years for preventing the burials of her victims.

The bodies of Dennehy's victims - Lukasz Slaboszewski, Kevin Lee and John Chapman - were found in March and April last year.

After
 the killings, Dennehy and Stretch drove to Hereford where she selected 
two other men - Robin Bereza and John Rogers - at random.

She repeatedly stabbed the dog walkers in the street but both survived.

All of the murder victims died from multiple stab injuries, including wounds to the heart.

After his death at a house in Peterborough, on or around March 19, the body of Mr Slaboszewski, 31, was stored in a wheelie bin.

At one point a smirking Dennehy showed the body to a teenage girl, prosecutor Peter Wright QC told the trial.

LUKASZ SLABOSZEWSKI

The 31-year-old moved to the UK from Nowa Sol, Poland, in 2005 to work in a DHL warehouse in Peterborough.

Cambridge
 Crown Court heard that, at the time of his death, he was being 
prescribed methadone as a substitute for his heroin addiction.

He
 was last seen alive leaving his home in the city’s Lincoln Road on 
March 19 last year having met Joanna Dennehy for the first time the 
previous day. He told friends he had found an 'English girlfriend'.

It is thought he was stabbed to death in a property in Rolleston Garth on or soon after this date.

Afterwards,
 Dennehy stored his body in a wheelie bin for several days before 
dumping it in a ditch at Thorney Dyke along with that of John Chapman. 
Their bodies were discovered by a farmer on April 3.

In
 a statement issued after his death by Mr Slaboszewski’s sister, Magda 
Skrzypczak, said: 'Lukasz was the joker in the family, always finding 
something to laugh about. His mum and dad are devastated by their loss and he also leaves two grieving sisters.'

JOHN CHAPMAN

The 56-year-old, originally from Leeds, had served with the Navy in the Falkland’s war.

Jurors heard he had fallen on hard times. He was an alcoholic but known as a 'friendly drunk', the court heard. Mr Chapman lived in the same set of bedsits as Dennehy in Bifield, Orton Goldhay.

He
 described Dennehy, who had been employed as an 'enforcer' by landlord 
Kevin Lee, as the 'man woman' and friends were concerned for his safety 
as she attempted to force him to move out, the court heard.

He
 was killed in his bedsit on March 29 after Dennehy stabbed him in the 
heart. A photograph of his body, timed at 7.32am that day, was found on 
Leslie Layton’s phone.

Mr Chapman’s body was found alongside that of Mr Slaboszewski on April 3. At the time, his family released a statement saying: 'We are all so upset and shocked by the tragic loss of John.

'He
 was a loving brother, brother in law and uncle. He was much loved by 
all who knew him and will be missed by all his friends and family.'

KEVIN LEE

The 48-year-old lived in Fletton, Peterborough, with his wife Christina and their two children.

He ran the Quick Let property firm, which specialised in providing bedsits to people of 'limited resources', prosecutors said.

Business
 partner Paul Creed told the court Dennehy had approached them seeking 
accommodation. Mr Creed had been reluctant to house her but Mr Lee 
wanted to 'give her a chance'.

Mr
 Lee later employed Dennehy as a decorator and enforcer, the court 
heard. On March 20, Mr Lee confessed to his wife that he was having an 
affair with Dennehy.

Nine
 days later, on Good Friday, he gave Dennehy an Easter card. Later that 
day she called him on the phone and arranged to meet him at Rolleston 
Garth - where Mr Slaboszewski had been killed - before stabbing him to 
death.

Mr Lee’s body was found by a dog walker in a ditch beside Middle Road, Newborough, on March 30. His
 family issued a statement saying: 'We are devastated by Kevin’s death, 
he was a wonderful husband, father, loving brother and son.

'His naturally infectious personality touched everyone who knew him. He will be hugely missed by all his friends and family.'
