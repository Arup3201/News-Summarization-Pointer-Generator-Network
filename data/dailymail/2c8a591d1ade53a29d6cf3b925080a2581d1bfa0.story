California has become the first state in the US to pass a law designed to define when 'yes means yes' to prevent sexual assaults.

The bill was signed by California Governor Jerry Brown yesterday and will adopt requirements for colleges to follow when investigating sexual assault reports.

The legislation says silence or lack of resistance do not constitute consent, and that someone who is drunk, drugged, unconscious or asleep cannot grant consent.

States and universities across the US are under pressure to change how they deal with sexual assault reports.

Campus sexual assault victims and women's advocacy groups delivered petitions to Gov Brown's office a fortnight ago urging him to sign the bill. 

Senator Kevin de Leon, who represents Los Angeles, said the legislation will change how college campuses in California look in to sexual assaults. 

Rather than using the refrain 'no means no,' the definition of consent under the bill requires 'an affirmative, conscious and voluntary agreement to engage in sexual activity.'

He said: 'With one in five women on college campuses experiencing sexual assault, it is high time the conversation regarding sexual assault be shifted to one of prevention, justice, and healing.' 

Lawmakers say consent can be nonverbal, and universities with similar policies have outlined examples as a nod of the head or moving in closer to the person.

Advocates for victims of sexual assault supported the change as one that will provide consistency across campuses and challenge the notion that victims must have resisted assault to have valid complaints.

The bill requires training for faculty reviewing complaints so victims are not asked inappropriate questions when filing complaints. 

The bill also requires access to counselling, health care services and other resources.

When lawmakers were considering the bill, critics said it was overreaching and could put universities in murky legal waters. 

Some Republicans in the Assembly questioned whether statewide legislation was an appropriate venue to define sexual consent between two people.

There was no opposition from Republicans in the state Senate.

Gordon Finley, an adviser to the National Coalition for Men, wrote an editorial asking Gov Brown not to sign the bill. He argued that 'this campus rape crusade bill' presumed the guilt of the accused.

The bill, called SB967, applies to all California post-secondary schools, public and private, that receive state money for student financial aid. 

The California State University and University of California systems are backing the legislation after adopting similar consent standards this year.

University of California President Janet Napolitano recently announced the system will voluntarily establish an independent advocate to support sexual assault victims on every campus.
