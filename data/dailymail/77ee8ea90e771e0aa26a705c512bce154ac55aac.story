After her brother died in a motorbike accident, Sharron Clarke decided to give him the 30th birthday gift he had always wanted – spending weeks making a 2ft novelty Rolex watch.

But days after she laid it on brother Andrew's grave it was gone – snatched by an opportunistic thief. Miss Clarke, 33, from Manchester, launched a Facebook appeal and was contacted by staff at a local pub, who told her someone had tried to sell the watch.

They gave her CCTV images of two suspects, which she has now passed on to police.

Scaffolder Mr Clarke, a father of two, was killed in May 2012 when his motorbike hit a car. His sister said: 'I just hope these vile people can be tracked down – it's an absolutely disgraceful thing to do.'

Mr Clarke died in a motorbike crash on May 18, 2012. 

Miss Clarke, from Openshaw, Greater Manchester, launched a Facebook appeal to track it down and was contacted by a member of staff at a pub who told her someone had tried to sell it.

She contacted the Waggon and Horses pub and was given CCTV images of the male and female suspects before passing them on to police.

She said: 'Andrew loved his cars and watches but could never afford to buy himself a Rolex.

'I spent two weeks with my mum making it - we put a lot of time and effort into doing it as we know Andrew would have appreciated the gesture.

'We only put the flowers on the grave on the Friday and they were stolen four days later.

'It made me feel physically sick when I found out they had been nicked and even worse that the thieves had been trying to sell it.

'It's absolutely disgraceful to think that anyone could do this - they really are the lowest of the low.'

Mr Clarke, a scaffolder, tragically died when his Suzuki GSXR600 bike collided with a Toyota Yaris.

Miss Clarke and their mother  Maureen, 60, regularly visit his grave in Gorton Cemetery but were left horrified when they discovered the tribute had gone missing.

She now wants CCTV installed at the cemetery to prevent future thefts.  

The suspected thieves were caught on CCTV carrying the giant novelty watch away from the cemetery 

She said: 'I put an appeal on a sale or swap page on Facebook and almost instantly a lady who worked at the pub replied to my message.

'She told me she felt suspicious when the suspects tried to sell her the tribute.

'I asked if I could check their CCTV footage and the landlord was brilliant - he did everything he could to help out.

'I gave the pictures to police who are now investigating. I just hope these vile people can be tracked down - it's an absolutely disgraceful thing to do.

'Hopefully some CCTV can be installed at the cemetery because this sort of thing should never happen.

'All we wanted to do was to pay respects to our loved ones in peace.'

Greater Manchester Police said an investigation was underway.
