He is more used to splashing his hallmark animal prints over long and languid evening gowns. But in a departure from his day job, Italian designer Roberto Cavalli has lent his aesthetic prowess to the motoring industry in the creation of a one-off MINI Paceman - and naturellement, it's all for charity.

It was the 13th time a unique MINI has been created in honour of the Life Ball, an event that raises money to help combat AIDS and HIV.

But while the other cars have raised a combined 500,000 euros for charity, this Cavalli number has singlehandedly given the coffers an incredible boost after it sold for 150,000 euros at the Life Ball last weekend.

That is one pimped ride! Designer Roberto Cavalli's customised MINI Paceman sold for 150,000 euros (£128,000) at the Life Ball AIDS gala in Vienna last week

Sir Elton John, Bill Clinton, Kelly Osbourne and Hilary Swank were just a handful of the big names present at the ball, held in Vienna, Austria.

The car was finished with a shimmering, iridescent paintwork that turned from black to brown depending on the angle from which it was viewed.

Inside, the upholstery is quilted black leather, the steering wheel is wrapped in more leather, and trim is gold - even the vents for the air conditioning are rendered in glossy metallics.

Since the beginning of the Life Ball partnership in 2001, 13 unique MINI models have been created, with auction proceeds of more than half a million Euros flowing into projects dedicated to the battle against AIDS. Besides Roberto Cavalli, a whole line-up of iconic international designers have styled a MINI for this good cause, among them Dean and Dan Caten of DSQUARED², Renzo Rosso for Diesel and Donatella Versace.The 2013 Life Ball MINI was created by Robert Cavalli who designed the new addition to the MINI family – the MINI Paceman in his highly distinctive style – gold elements inside and out, iridescent paintwork that shimmers from black to brown depending on the angle of light and the use of his hallmark animal prints make this MINI Paceman an unmistakably authentic Cavalli creation.The Cavalli MINI Paceman was auctioned for a record 150,000 euros during the AIDS Solidarity gala. The entire proceeds will go to projects helping to combat HIV/AIDS.Called 1001 Nights, this year’s Life Ball once again brought together numerous celebrities, including Bill Clinton, Sir Elton John, Hilary Swank, Fergie, Melanie Griffith, Barbara Eden (“I Dream of Jeannie”), Carmen Electra,  Anna Netrebko, Erwin Schrott and Kelly Osbourne to raise global awareness of the HIV virus and its consequences
