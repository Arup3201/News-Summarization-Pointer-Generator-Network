Topless protest group Femen has opened a branch in Brazil with members pictured today being dragged naked from a shopping Mall in Sao Paulo as they demonstrated against exploitation in the Big Brother gameshow.

The activists, who strip off to highlight a range of issues, including women's rights, press freedom and domestic violence were dragged kicking and screaming from the premises by security guards.

Three women had staged the protest in Sao Paulo's Santana shopping mall where two contestants of Big Brother Brazil were on display in a glass house with viewers being asked to choose the winner.

The women, which included Femen Brazil founding member Sara Winter, Anna 
Steel and Amanda Roseo-Alba, burst in at around 9.30pm and took off 
their sweaters to reveal slogans across their bodies such as 'wake up 
people!'

All three were detained by security guards but released at around 2.00am the following morning.

Femen was founded in Kiev in 2008 to 
protest against Ukraine's booming sex industry. At their first 
demonstration members appeared clothed carrying banners reading 'Ukraine
 is not a brothel!'.

But it was the demonstrations in favor of the jailed Russia punk group Pussy Riot in August last year that brought the group to the attention of the worldwide media.

Femen was started in the Ukraine in 2008 as to protest against that country's booming sex industry and has since gone from strength to strength with 150,000 members worldwide

The organisation has since gone from 
strength to strength with 150,000 members worldwide and branches across 
Europe and even in highly conservative countries such as Egypt.

Three women were arrested including two members of Femen and another who joined in the protest spontaneously.

In September last year Military Police in Rio de Janiero arrested two women protesting topless on the Esplanade of Ministries during the country's Independence Day parades.

During the Olympic protest, demonstrators organised an 'islamic marathon' to 
demonstrate against 'islamic regimes' they say are being supported by 
the IOC.

The topless activists staged several high-profile FEMEN protests across Europe last year

At the time Femen Brazil founding 
member Sara Winter criticised the arrests arguing that while Brazil's 
hugely popular carnivals exploit female nudity the country does not 
tolerate it during a political protest.

In
 another incident Ms Winter attempted to invade the stage during a 
performance by pop star Gretchen but was held back by security guards.

At the end of the show she managed to
 get onstage where she was pictured holding a sign with the phrase: 
'Every three minutes, a woman is beaten in Brazil.'

During
 last year's Olympic games four topless Femen activists were arrested 
after a protest in central London after accusing the Olympics' 
organisers of having supported 'bloody' Islamist regimes.

Some of the women had slogans marked on their bare chests. At least one carried the message: 'No Sharia'.

Three months earlier Femen activists 
managed to snatch football's European Championship trophy on two 
occasions during the tournament in the Ukraine.

They grabbed the cup in May while it was on display in a central square in Dnipropetrovsk, south-east Ukraine.

One activist took off her top to reveal an offensive slogan before picking up the trophy.

As security guards moved in on her, another activist, standing next to the cup, stripped off to the waist to display the same slogan.

In February last year the protest group clashed with Italian police during Milan Fashion Week after a demonstration against the use of anorexic models.

The topless protesters wore jeans and had handwritten slogans such as 'Fashion = Fascism' and 'Anorexia' scrawled across their chests.

A similar protest was held in January in the Swiss resort of Davos in January, where the World Economic Forum held its annual meeting.
