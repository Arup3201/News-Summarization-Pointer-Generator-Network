An extra 130,000 primary school places are needed within three years due to soaring immigration and a high birth rate, figures reveal.

Record numbers of families will face disappointment when primary schools are allocated next week, following a steep rise in applicants.

This is partly due to the impact of immigration, as well as a booming birth rate and the fact that fewer middle class parents can afford to send their children to private school.

Councils are already deploying emergency measures to deal with the influx, such as squeezing pupils into ‘bulge’ classes and using little-known legal powers to override class size limits.

But as many as 100,000 pupils – one in five in some areas – are expected to miss out on their first-choice primary, with around ten pupils fighting for each place at some of the most sought-after schools.

Bygrove Primary School in Tower Hamlets, East London – which was rated ‘outstanding’ by Ofsted – received 312 applications for just 30 places.

It has been reported that some parents are even resorting to cheating to win offers from their chosen schools, by providing fake addresses or lying about sibling links.

Councils contacted by the Mail cited a Local Government Association report, which found that 130,000 extra primary places will be needed by 2017 – the equivalent of 4,750 classes or around 500 primary schools. Almost 90,000 additional places have already been created this academic year.

Areas under the most pressure include Bristol and Manchester, as well as parts of London such as Croydon, Harrow, Waltham Forest and Newham, many of which are home to high numbers of migrant families.

A report revealed on Thursday that officials drastically underestimated levels of immigration, missing 350,000 migrants from Eastern Europe after checking the wrong airports. Croydon alone needs to create 13,501 more places – 43 per cent of its current capacity – and in Harrow, applications have risen 14.8 per cent compared with last year.

About half of councils that responded to the Mail’s survey said they were using ‘bulge’ classes – a one-off extra reception class that continues through the school.

Meanwhile in Leicester, the council has recently used powers to provide extra places through an agreed ‘overfilling’ of classes in the first three years of primary school. The policy can only be used for applicants who are new to the area. In other local authorities, disused office blocks are being turned into classrooms, and existing schools are being frantically expanded.

In Brighton and Hove – where it has emerged that more than one in six primary pupils will miss out on their preferred school this year – the council is converting a former police station into extra classrooms.

The survey also suggests there has been an increase in the number of parents trying to play the system by lying about their child’s address.

In Lambeth, the council will be issuing some ‘conditional offers’ to about a dozen families as it pursues anti-fraud investigations.

And in Hartlepool, eight suspicious cases were investigated during the current admissions round, six of which were found to be fraudulent. Four were investigated last year.

According to the Office for National Statistics, the UK population is set to increase by almost ten million over the next 25 years.

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘We are increasing the number of good school places by tackling under performance and opening new free schools and academies.

‘We have more than doubled to £5billion the funding available to local authorities to create new school places and we are allowing good schools to expand without the restrictions and bureaucracy they faced in the past.’
