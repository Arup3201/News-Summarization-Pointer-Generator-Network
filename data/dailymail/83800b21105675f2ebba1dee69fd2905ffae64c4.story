St Andrews in Scotland has now earned a a new claim to fame as the most costly spot to spend a night in Britain in 2014. Visitors wanting to experience the historic town, which boasts the third oldest university in the UK can expect to cough up £158 per room per night

Hotel rooms were more than £20 cheaper in London than St Andrews with the average costing £136

This is a five per cent rise from last year where hotel rooms cost £148, according to the latest Hotels.com Hotel Price Index.

It was above London, at £136, Oxford at £127, Bath at £120 and Windsor at £118. Only one place in the top 10 the channel island of Jersey, had hotel rooms averaging under £100 a night.

It was also the only place in the top 10 to see a decline in hotel prices, dropping 4 per cent on 2013 to £97 per night. 

The beautiful hilly vistas and historic sights of Bristol proved popular with tourists as the city recorded the greatest increase in hotel prices - a rise of 13 per cent to £87 per night 

Growing consumer confidence triggered by the boost in the UK economy of 2.6 per cent in 2014 meant more people were happy to spend on hotel rooms. Coupled with increased foreign tourism, this increase meant average hotel prices paid by all travellers in the UK went up by 2 per cent to £104.

Matt Walls, vice president of Hotels.com, said: 'The UK clearly displayed the ability to attract a record number of visitors in 2014. In spite of the increase in the national average room rate, overall prices paid by consumers are still great value, a clear indication that the tourism industry here is in good shape.'

North of England seaside destinations like Scarborough provide the best value, with rooms averaging £61

The beautiful hilly vistas and historic sights of Bristol proved popular with tourists as the city recorded the greatest increase in hotel prices - a rise of 13 per cent to £87 per night. 

Sporting events also contributed to boosting a city's fortunes with the Commonwealth Games contributing to a 12 per cent increase in Glasgow to £87, while the Tour de France triggered an 8 per cent rise in Leeds to £79.

Holidaymakers wanting to escape home without shelling out £100 a night are advised to stick to the North of England.

Bradford, the curry capital of Britain, was the best value for money place to stay, with rooms reaching an average of £51 a night. 

Seaside destinations like Scarborough and Blackpool also proved affordable options, with the average price of hotels at £61 per night. 

Increases were spread across the country as all but five of the 46 destinations included in the report saw their figures rise.

But prices dipped in several holiday favourites with the Cotswolds down 8 per cent to £87 and the Lake District slipping 2 per cent to £86. Canterbury slipping and Sheffield both slipped down by 1 per cent to £84 and £65 respectively. 

 Across the world, the boost in the global economy seen in 2014 was mirrored by a  three per cent rise in the average hotel prices as  consumers became more confident in raising their travel spending. 

Hotel prices have now experienced five years of steady price rises since they plummeted during the financial collapse of 2008/9.

Glasgow saw a boost from the Commonweath Games, with hotel prices increasing by 12 per cent  to £87

Johan Svanstrom, President of the Hotels.com brand, said: 'Although the Index rose again last year, it is still way behind its peak of seven years ago which is great news for consumers.

'Each year is unique in the travel industry and 2014 was no exception, bringing its own opportunities and challenges. Global events, such as the Winter Olympic Games and World Cup, predictably attracted travellers to new destinations. 

'Yet unforeseen tragedies, including the Ebola outbreak, the missing Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 and the loss of MH17 left their own mark.'
