A Lithuanian builder has appeared in court accused of the double murder of a married couple who were found stabbed to death at their £750,000 home in Surrey. 

Viktoras Bruzas, 38, is accused of murdering Patrick Kettyle, 55, and his wife Gillian, 54, who were discovered at the semi-detached property in Fetcham shortly after midnight on Thursday last week.

Their deaths sparked a police search for  Bruzas, 38, who was arrested 18 hours later in nearby Oxshott.

The self-employed builder, from Walton-on-Thames, appeared at Guildford Crown Court today charged with two counts of murder. 

He had appeared briefly at South East Surrey Magistrates' Court in Redhill, Surrey, on Saturday, when his case was sent straight to the crown court. 

With short brown hair and wearing a grey jumper, Bruzas spoke only to confirm his name as he appeared in the dock.

Judge Christopher Critchlow, Honorary Recorder of Guildford, transferred the case to the Old Bailey in central London.

Kristina Bruziene, the ex wife of Bruzas, was employed by the couple as a secretary in 2012

Bruzas, who moved to England in 2008, was remanded in custody.

The next hearing will be at the Central Criminal Court, the Old Bailey, on December 19.  

Initial post mortem examinations show the couple died as the result of multiple knife wounds. 

A weapon was found near their home after detectives began a forensic search of the area.

Police say Bruzas and the Kettyle family were known to each.

Mr Kettyle had employed Bruzas’s ex-wife, Kristina Bruziene, 37, as a secretary at his million-pound building and property development firm.

He ran the company from his home, while his wife worked as a facilities manager at Cargill Plc in Cobham, Surrey. 

Bruzas grew up in Kaunas, Lithuania, the country’s second biggest city, 65 miles west of the capital, Vilnius.

He married his wife in Lithuania before they moved to the UK in their twenties.

The couple settled in Forest Gate, East London, and had their son Richard, who was born in September 2007.

Relatives described the couple as 'really lovely people' who did not deserve what happened to them.

Mrs Kettyle's ex-husband, Andrew Farrow, was devastated at her loss, saying: 'My life and Gill's had not crossed paths for some time, but it took me years to get over Gill.' 

Another man in his 30s who was arrested at a property in Walton-on-Thames in Surrey on Thursday has been released with no further action taken against him, police said. 

The next hearing will take place on December 19, in front of Mr Justice Sweeney.   

Police set up at the scene. Initial post-mortem results show the couple died from stab wounds 

Fetcham is a leafy commuter village in Surrey, just south of the M25
