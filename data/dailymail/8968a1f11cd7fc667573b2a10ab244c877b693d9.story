Pleaded guilty: PC Helen Jones, 31, is said to have posed as an on-duty officer in Merseyside. When this photograph was taken, Helen Jones was a PCSO with Cheshire Constabulary

A police officer has pleaded guilty to falsely obtaining CCTV video of an alleged street dispute involving footballer Steven Gerrard.

PCSO Helen Jones, 31, is said to have pretended she was on-duty in order to get the footage from a bank near the footballer’s home in Formby, Merseyside.

It is alleged to show a dispute involving the former England captain, his wife Alex and another man that has led to a legal battle in the High Court.

Jones, who had previously pleaded not guilty to a misconduct charge, changed her plea as she was due to face trial today at Preston Crown Court in Lancashire.

She was said to have ‘wilfully and without reasonable excuse or justification misrepresented she was an on-duty police officer and recovered CCTV.’

Richard Hough, prosecuting, told the court that the Crown did not accept the basis of her plea because it is alleged she had a ‘criminal or illegal purpose’ for obtaining the CCTV.

‘The Crown say this whole enterprise by the defendant was carried out in effect for a criminal or illegal purpose to be carried out by others,’ he said.

‘Her role was to perpetrate criminal matters or illegal matters.’

Mr Hough added that she had ‘told lies’ and been ‘deceitful’ in her statement to police following her arrest and had sought to provide an alibi.

Roderick Jones, defending, said it was his client's position that she did not obtain the footage for a criminal purpose.

At
 the time of the incident - on August 8, 2013 - Jones was on a career 
break from Merseyside Police after starting a sabbatical in March that 
year.

Although she was still employed by the force she was not an acting officer when the alleged dispute took place.

Merseyside
 Police said Jones resigned last December, and she will therefore avoid 
any potential disciplinary proceedings after the conclusion of the court
 case.

Liverpool star Gerrard, 34, his 32-year-old wife Alex
 and the player’s close friend Lee McPartland were named in legal papers
 in a civil action lodged at the High Court in London the same month.

A
 man named Paul Alan Lloyd, who lives on the same road as the 
footballer, is thought to be seeking damages from them in connection 
with the incident.

A spokesman for London law firm Mishcon De Reya confirmed it was acting for Mr Lloyd but would not comment further.

Merseyside
 Police is not treating alleged dispute as a criminal matter and has not
 received any complaints from any of the parties involved.

Jones, from Chatham, Kent, was released on bail to attend a further hearing next Wednesday when a trial of issue on her plea may take place and she may give evidence.
