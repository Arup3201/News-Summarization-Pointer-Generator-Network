You may not be able to sneak a bottle of wine into your local theater, but at least now there is the possibility to feel as though you've had a sip, thanks to this latest foodie first.

Popcorn fused with wine is the latest hybrid invention between NYC-based Populence and New Zealand wine maker Kim Crawford.

The boozy snack comes in two flavors: Pinot Noir Drizzle and Sauvignon Blanc Kettle.

Snack attack: New York City-based Populence has joined forces with New Zealand winemaker Kim Crawford to create its Pinot Noir Chocolate Drizzle and Sauvignon Blanc Kettle

Pricey popcorn: A one -gallon tin of the stuff costs $35 - and it won't get you drunk either

Wine Popcorn: There must almost be enough in that bowl to get drunk!

The idea is to physically pair up the 
wine-drizzled popcorn with a bottle of the real thing, however you won't get 
drunk from munching away on the corn kernels however.

The
non-alcoholic snacks were inspired by the fact that Populence founder 
Maggie Paulus noticed that her wares were especially popular for wine 
pairing parties.

'The idea of actually incorporating a high-end wine such as Kim Crawford into a unique new recipe is exciting,' she said.

The two new flavors are made in-house at Populence's New York's West Village store.

Homemade: The pinot noir flavor (left) sees the red wine reduction mixed with tempered chocolate. The sauvignon blanc flavor requires the wine and lemon rind to be added to the uncooked kernels with sugar

Addictive: Would you have to sign up to WW or AA if you became hooked on wine flavoured popcorn?

An unlikely pairing: Popcorn fused with wine... or is that just the leftovers from last nights party?

The sweet popcorn's final flavor is bright and zesty and pairs beautifully with the wine, just as it is meant to be enjoyed.

Marketing spokesman Nila Vermiglio said that the company had done a 'fantastic job of capturing the wines' notes'.

'The
lemony Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc Lemon is bright and zesty, bursting
with flavour and pairing beautifully with the wine, while the indulgent
Kim Crawford Pinot Noir Chocolate Drizzle uses the classic pairing of 
wine with chocolate to harness the wine's flavours into an indulgent 
treat.'

But the boozy blend 
doesn't come cheap. With a one gallon tin for $35, you may be better off
just dipping your popcorn in your wine glass!
