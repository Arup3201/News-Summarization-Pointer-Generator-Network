James Packer has hit the red carpet in Hollywood in support of his friend and business partner, Hercules director Brett Ratner.

The casino mogul, who with Ratner owns production company RatPac Entertainment, scrubbed up by putting on a pair of aviator sunglasses, a sleek black suit and an open-collared white shirt for the film's premiere.

It was a far cry from the baggy pair of dark blue, worn tracksuit bottoms and daggy grey jumper he was seen wearing as he left his upscale hotel in New York two days ago.

Packer cracked a smile and put his hand around Ratner's shoulder as they posed for photos before the screening of the Greek demigod blockbuster starring Dwayne Johnson.

Earlier this week Packer and his sister Gretel announced a 10-year, $200 million commitment from the Packer family and Crown Resorts to fund arts, charities and indigenous education.

Packer and Ratner formed Rat-Pac Entertainment, which is quickly becoming Hollywood's new power player, in 2012 as an independent film company and the business has since branched out into TV, book publishing, documentaries and a China offshoot.

Its first film, the Sandra Bullock-George Clooney space disaster Gravity, won seven Oscars at this year's Academy Awards and earned $US716 million at the global box office.

Other films include the Robert De Niro-Sylvester Stallone comedy Grudge Match, Horrible Bosses 2 and the adaptation of the Frankie Valli-Four Seasons Broadway hit Jersey Boys.

They recently moved into the office that used to belong to the original king of cool and head of the Rat Pack, Frank Sinatra.

'There is no brand cooler than RatPac and, by the way, this was all James's idea,' Ratner said.

'He called me up one day and said, "You're Ratner, I'm Packer. We are the only two people aside from Frank Sinatra that can have a company called RatPac. Ratner and Packer makes sense".'

Ratner, who is known for directing the Rush Hour films, also said the paid 'love making films' and that 'content is king'.

'James, as you know, was in the distribution business before with Channel Nine, and now he's out of that, traditional media per se, and we are working really hard at creating great content,' he said.

RatPac, along with another mogul, Dune's Steve Mnuchin, have a four-year, $US450 million deal with Warner Bros. to fund as many as 75 of the studio's films.

Warner Bros. has also signed a first look deal with RatPac for 32 projects involving Hollywood stars and filmmakers including Eastwood, Robert Downey Jr and Matt Damon.

Packer and Ratner first met when Ratner was in Sydney in 2002 promoting his thriller with Anthony Hopkins, Red Dragon.

'I actually met his wife Erica first when I was doing Red Dragon in Australia,' Ratner said.

'We were premiering the movie there and that's where our friendship started.

'This was before Erica was James's wife.

'It goes back years.'

Packer and Ratner, of course, have other business interests.

Packer has his multi-billion dollar Crown casino operation and Ratner was in Hungary for four months shooting Hercules.

'I have never seen somebody so committed to something.'

Ratner was also impressed with Packer's May street fight with good friend and best man David Gyngell.

'Oh yeah, he can scrap,' Ratner laughed.

'But, Sinatra got into a lot of fights back in the day.'
