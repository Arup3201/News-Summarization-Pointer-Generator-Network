Anthony Weiner lost his cool today on the campaign trail, engaging in a blazing shouting match with a constituent who insulted him and his wife.

New York's infamous mayoral candidate was out and about in the Borough Hall area of Brooklyn ahead of celebrations on Thursday for Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year.

The politician was picking up some traditional baked goods in the strongly Orthodox Jewish community, when a man in a yarmulke came up to Weiner, called him a 'scumbag' and added: 'You’re married to an Arab' making a reference to the disgraced congressman's wife Huma Abedin.

Weiner shot back at the man calling him a 'jackass', while chewing a large mouthful of cake.

Showdown: In a Brooklyn bakery, Anthony Weiner got into a tit-for-tat argument with a constituent today after the man said the mayoral candidate was a 'deviant'

Weiner replied: 'Charming. Takes one to know one, jackass.'

The heated exchange was caught on video by Weiner's campaign. 

Weiner then said: 'You wait until I walk out to say anything. That's courage. Go ahead.'

He then returned to the store before a tit-for-tat shouting match ensues. The man told Weiner: 'You have a nerve to even walk around in public. You are disgusting.'

To which Weiner responded: 'Oh yeah, and you're a perfect person?'

Spat with a voter: Customers at the Brooklyn bakery looked on in disbelief at the heated exchange

Displeased: Weiner's patience with constituents' opinions following his sexting scandal appears to be wearing thin

The man returned: 'I'm not perfect, but I didn't do what you did.'

Weiner would not let the issue go, raising his voice and pointing his finger at the man, while customers in the bakery looked on in disbelief.

The disgraced politician said: 'You're my judge? You're my judge? What rabbi taught you that? What rabbi taught you that you're my judge?'

The man said: 'You're fine. You talk to God and work out your problems, but stay out of the public eye. That's the difference.'

Public opinion: The man confronted Weiner in the Brooklyn bakery

Weiner continued: 'That's up to you to judge, my friend. I don't take my judgments to you and I don't judge you.'

The voter said: 'You're a bad example for the people.'

Weiner fired back: 'That's your judgment?'

The man then reasoned: 'No, that's obvious. Your behavior is deviant.'

The voter then asks how Weiner could betray the person closest to him, referring to the politician's long-suffering wife Huma Abedin, as the politician continues to shout over him.

As Weiner became more and more hysterical, the man calmly answers that he is not judging the politician but says he should stay out of the public, go home and get a job.

Weiner then adds: 'By the way, I have fought very hard for this community and delivered more than you will ever in your entire life.'

Losing his cool: Weiner shouts back at the man after he told the politician to take himself out of public life because his behavior was not normal

The man calmly says: 'You never delivered anything to me or for any of these people.'

The mayoral then calls the constituent 'ignorant' before turning away with the remark: 'Take care buddy, nice talking to you.'

Outside the shop, Weiner attempted to brush off the incident, saying: 'I don't back down' before adding that the man had every right to his opinion because 'this is America'.

The shouting match came as it was announced earlier this week that support had collapsed for ex-congressman Weiner, a former front-runner amid a new sexting scandal with student-turned-porn-star Sydney Leathers.

Weiner is now in a distant fourth, with only 7 per cent of the vote.

Weiner also embarrassed himself on Monday by putting on a fake and bizarre Caribbean accent as he shouted to crowds from a float at the West Indian Day Parade in Brooklyn.
