It was reported that the couple had been on a walk with their miniature beagle, Charlie, when Eric presented his girlfriend with a dazzling ring from his sister Ivanka's fine jewelry collection.

They then celebrated with champagne, which Eric, EVP of development and acquisitions at his father's company, had brought along for the occasion.

When asked by OK! magazine about what they were most looking forward to on the big day, Yunaska laughed, 'Probably being done with wedding planning!

'We're looking very much forward to our honeymoon. We're going to go to Africa and then we're going to go to France.'

According to Page Six, the couple's wedding website jokingly describes Eric as 'born into a relatively unknown New York family... Eric embraced his family's passion for Erector sets, Monopoly and Jenga, which ultimately led to a very successful career in construction and real estate.'

Lara, a native of Wilmington, North Carolina, certainly looks the Trump wife part, with her blonde hair, washboard abs and permanent tan.

After graduating from North Carolina State University, she attended the French Culinary Institute where she obtained a degree in Pastry Arts. 

She and Eric live together in New York City, where they regularly spend time with Eric's older sister Ivanka, her husband Jared Kushner and their two young children Arabella and Joseph. 

The couple were married at Donald Trump's swanky Mar-a-Lago club. 

The 62,000 square-foot club, which was built in the 1920s by Post cereal heiress Marjorie Merriwether Post, is incredibly opulent and seated on a premiere piece of land in Palm Beach, Florida.

According to the club's website, the Six-Star Diamond Award-holding club sits on 20 acres of manicured lawns and has 126 rooms.

It was deemed a National Historic Landmark in 1972, a year before the heiress' death.

Members are lavished with services from formal and casual dining to salons, spas, and a two-acre private beach.

Its design mimics the Mediterranean villa style with elements of Moorish, Venetian, and Spanish influences.

Mrs Post used two different architects – one to design the inside and the other to oversee the outside.

Upon her death in 1973, she willed it to the U.S. government for use as a winter White House.

But the U.S. government said it was too rich for their tastes, citing the annual $1million maintenance costs as the reason for declining, according to the Palm Beach Post.

It was also too close to the Palm Beach airport.

It was purchased by the Donald in 1985 for $10million.

Mr Trump later renovated the mansion, adding a 20,000 square-foot ballroom, tennis and croquet courts, spa, and beach club.

In 2012 bargain hunters looking to join what is arguably one of the country's most exclusive clubs were told the $200,000 initiation fee had bee slashed to $100,000 for membership privileges. 

The name Mar-a-Lago is Spanish for Sea-to-Lake.
