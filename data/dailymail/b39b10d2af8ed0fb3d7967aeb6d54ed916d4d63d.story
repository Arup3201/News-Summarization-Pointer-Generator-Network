Released: Muhammad al-Zahrani, 45, was sent back to his homeland after a U.S. government board decided that he no longer posed a threat 

A Saudi citizen with links to al Qaeda has been released from Guantanamo Bay after serving 12 years.

Muhammad al-Zahrani, 45, was sent back to his homeland of Saudi Arabia on Friday after a U.S. government board decided that he no longer posed a threat. 

The move came as the U.S government whittles down the prison population at the controversial prison base in Cuba in a bid to close the controversial base.

According to officials, even more prisoners will be released from the site where 142 men are currently held including 73 who have already been cleared for release.

Al-Zahrani is the thirteenth prisoner to leave Guantanamo Bay this year and the seventh in just the past two weeks.

During his hearing, his lawyers told the review board that he was no longer a threat to the U.S. and was instead a 'middle-aged, ailing man who desperately wanted to return to Saudi Arabia.'

They said that he was a changed man because his father had died while he was in U.S. custody and 'his only wish was to see his ailing mother before she passed away.'

But the Saudi national is alleged to have traveled to Afghanistan in 1999 and 'almost certainly' joined al-Qaida, trained in military tactics, and fought the Northern Alliance. 

He was detained at Guantanamo in August 2002. But has agreed to take part in a Saudi program to rehabilitate militants upon his release. 

It was argued that he was less of a threat than five senior Taliban leaders held at Guantanamo who were exchanged for U.S. Army Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl - the last American prisoner of war in Afghanistan. 

The Periodic Review Board initially cleared al-Zahrani for release in October, citing a number of factors including his willingness to participate in the rehabilitation program.

However, the board decided that a second Saudi inmate with links to
al Qaeda - Muhammed Abd Al Rahman Awn Al-Shamrani - should not be released.

Al-Shamrani, 39,  is still regarded as a considerable security threat.

He is alleged to have been  a key facilitator and recruiter for al Qaeda and the Taliban in
Saudi Arabia and carried out front line fighting in Afghanistan. 

He has been held at the Guantanamo Bay U.S. Naval Base since January 2002, and has served 12 years and 10 months during which time he's had 'significant disciplinary infractions.'

Release: In the coming weeks, more prisoners will be released as part of a renewed effort to close the site

Prison: The controversial base still holds 142 detainees including 73 already cleared for release

The inmates assessments were carried out by the 'Periodic Review Board' which was established to speed up Guantanamo's closing as ordered by President Barack Obama. 

Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel is tasked with informing Congress of any U.S.intent to transfer inmates.  

The controversial base still holds 142 detainees.
