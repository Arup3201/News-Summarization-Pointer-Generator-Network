This was the year we’d be wearing shoes that tied their own laces — or so the Back To The Future films predicted in the Eighties.

While this may seem as fanciful now as it did then, 2015 does looks set to be the year of so-called ‘wearable technology’, clothing and accessories that could transform not only our wardrobes, but our health, too.

Until now, wearable technology has largely taken the form of wristband trackers — such as the Fitbit (launched in 2008), 2011’s Jawbone and the much-hyped Apple Watch, due to go on sale on April 24.

But now, manufacturers are developing everyday items of clothing and shoes that can monitor our vital signs, and even treat serious conditions. 

The latest innovations include a bra that could deliver life-saving breast cancer medication and socks that warn if you’re at risk of injury.

Hi-tech: A bra contains technology which allows tiny ‘nano’ particles of a substance - for instance, a drug - to be embedded into a material

Even big brands are moving into the market — this year, the U.S. designer Ralph Lauren will launch a sports top that monitors heart rate, muscle movement and calories burnt.

‘So far, wearable technology in the context of well-being has been mainly about monitoring personal data,’ says Caroline Till, course leader in Material Futures at Central St Martins, University of the Arts London. ‘The question now is what do you do with the data once you have it? Is the information of value?’

This is where the latest technology comes in, with the focus on giving you feedback from the information collated. 

So in theory, ‘wearables’, as they’re known, will not only take your blood pressure reading, they’ll tell you if it’s dangerously high. 

‘The holy grail of wearable technology is something that’s integrated seamlessly into something you wear or use already, so you don’t notice it’s there,’ says Caroline Till.

This is now closer to being a reality because circuitry can be made small and light enough to be embedded in clothing. 

Another material technology, known as micro-encapsulation, allows tiny ‘nano’ particles of a substance — for instance, a drug — to be embedded into a material so it is gradually absorbed through the skin when worn.

Here, we look at the latest ‘wearables’— some of which are already available, with others still being developed — that could transform our health . . .

The Omsignal top has sensors woven into the fabric in the chest to monitor heart rate and breathing

BRA THAT DELIVERS CANCER DRUGS

The Foxleaf bra contains micro-encapsulated ‘bubbles’ of the drug Tamoxifen in soft, plastic inserts in the cups.

The idea is that the body’s heat and moisture rub off the bubbles’ coating and the Tamoxifen, which blocks oestrogen to slow the growth of cancer cells, can be gradually absorbed through the skin throughout the day.

The bra was developed by Sarah Da Costa, a Masters student at Central St Martins, London.

It aims to provide a possible solution for thousands of women who find the side-effects of Tamoxifen intolerable. 

Delivering the drug locally means less has to be processed by the liver, potentially reducing side-effects such as hot flushes, cramps and nausea. 

There are now plans to run clinical trials to work out at what rate the drug would be absorbed.

Da Costa’s next project is to see whether similar technology could be used to deliver dementia drug galantamine via bedding or nightwear.

VEST TO HELP YOU BURN OFF CALORIES

NASA scientist Dr Wayne B Hayes has invented the Cold Shoulder vest, which he says boosts your body’s ability to burn calories.

The vest, which can be kept in the freezer, has pockets for ice packs around the back and shoulders. The idea is that by wearing the vest your body has to burn more calories to stay warm — as much as an extra 500 calories a day, says Dr Hayes.

From around £90 ($139.99) from cold-shoulder.com

Sun savvy: The Netatmo June bracelet has a sensor that measures UV light

T-SHIRT TO MONITOR YOUR HEART

Omsignal, the company working with Ralph Lauren to create a tech sports shirt, has a top already on sale that has sensors woven into the fabric in the chest to monitor heart rate and breathing. The sensors can also monitor the electrical activity of the heart.

Fibres feed this information to a ‘black box’ — about the size of a credit card — attached to the shirt. The box sends the information to your mobile, with alerts from your phone telling you to breathe more, slow down or speed up.

The heart and breathing rate data is also used to estimate how many calories you’re burning — thought to be much more accurate than standard fitness tracking wristbands which make calculations based on how much you’re moving. At the moment the garment has only been designed for men. A version for women is in development.

Around £160 from omsignal.com

DRESS THAT GETS MUMS-TO-BE MOVING

It’s a wrap-dress, but not as you know it — maternity dresses designed by Blake Uretsky, a fashion student at Cornell University in the U.S., contain conductive silver fibres under the bust to monitor a pregnant woman’s heart rate, breathing, blood pressure and temperature, along with a device worn on the belt that can then communicate with a smartphone.

The dress can then alert a mother-to-be if her readings suggest she might be over doing it — or not being active enough.

Some research has suggested that women who are more active during pregnancy have fewer complications during both gestation and labour.

The Lumo Lift brooch aims to improve your posture

BRACELET TO TELL YOU TO TOP UP SUN CREAM

Unlike conventional wristband trackers, the Netatmo June is designed to look like a piece of jewellery, with a multifaceted gem on a leather double-wrap strap. But the ‘gem’ is a sensor that measures UV light — the harmful invisible rays that cause sunburn and skin damage.

The sensor transmits information on your sun exposure to an iPhone and, if it detects you’re reaching a harmful level, it will send you an alert.

You can also tell it what factor sun cream — if any — you’re wearing, and it will remind you to re-apply it or recommend that you use a higher factor.

BROOCH TO BANISH BACK PAIN

The Lumo Lift posture coach is a sensor about the size of two 50p pieces that aims to improve your posture. It’s worn just under your collar bone. There are decorative versions that can be pinned on your clothes like a brooch or tie pin or others that can be clipped out of sight around a bra strap or vest.

You set the sensor when you start wearing it so it knows what your ‘good’ posture should be.

To do this, you press a button on the device while you’re standing tall, with your shoulders back and relaxed, feet hip distance apart and weight evenly distributed, bottom and stomach pulled in.

You can then programme it to vibrate every time it detects you’re slouching.

Maintaining good posture can be a key step in preventing back pain, according to the British Chiropractic Association. Correct posture keeps your joints aligned, helping to avoid straining your muscles.

Lechal trainers have touch technology in the insole that give you directions

RUNNING SOCKS THAT CAN PREVENT INJURY

Sensoria’s smart running socks monitor the way your feet strike the ground, warning you if you are at risk of injury and also how to correct your stride. ‘Flaws in your gait are a common cause of injury,’ says physiotherapist Sammy Margo.

The Sensoria socks detect how your foot lands, and conductive fibres then relay this information to a small clip-on device on the ankle. This sends information to your phone, which can issue real-time audio warnings and advice if needs be.

From around £130 ($199), sensoriafitness.com

SHOES THAT STOP YOU GETTING LOST

Lechal trainers have touch technology in the insole that not only counts your steps and estimates calories burnt, it also gives you directions so you can stick to a route. The shoes are based on ‘haptics’ — touch technology that gives you physical feedback from an electronic device, like a games console controller that vibrates if you crash a car in the game you’re playing.

Once you’ve programmed your route into a mobile phone app, the shoes vibrate on either the left or the right to tell you how to reach your destination.

Available to pre-order from around £100, lechal.com

AND FINALLY, THE BLOUSE THAT HUGS YOU

As seen on the catwalk at New York Fashion Week last autumn, the Hug Shirt, invented by London CuteCircuit, uses haptic technology to mimic the sensation of a cuddle.

The shirt contains sensors and tiny motors to generate warmth and pressure that feel like a hug. The idea, the inventors say, is to allow friends to ‘send’ each other hugs even when they’re miles apart.
