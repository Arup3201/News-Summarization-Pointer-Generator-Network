Free childcare places should be scrapped for middle-class families with help targeted at poorer children, education watchdog Ofsted claims today.

Sue Gregory, the inspectorate's National Director of Education, warns funding is spread ‘very thinly’ in offering all three-year-olds 15 hours at a nursery or childminder during term time.

She suggests childcare should instead be funded on the same basis as the coalition’s Pupil Premium in schools, where schools receive extra cash linked to the number of children from the poorest families.

The soaring cost of childcare has become a major issue for the government, with some studies suggesting a family where a second earner takes a job on the minimum wage will be just £4-a-week better off than if they stayed at home.

Family policy championed by Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has seen childcare provision extended to two-year-olds from the 40 per cent of least well-off families.

But in a lecture today, Ms Gregory suggests the universal subsidy for three-year-olds is not working.

‘Universal provision has spread resources very thinly and it's crucial that lessons are learnt from current schemes in operation,’ she was due to say Foundling Museum in Central London.

‘Schools receive additional funding for their most disadvantaged pupils through the Pupil Premium.

‘A similar scheme could work in early years to help ensure that high quality staff are employed where the two-year-old offer is most needed.’

From January child benefit is being cut for families where one person earns more than £50,000, and any further attempt to target cuts on well-off parents will be politically-contentious.

Ms Gregory says a Pupil Premium-style
funding system for under-5s would help close the gap in learning 
between children from different backgrounds.

In
her speech she does not explicitly say that funding for middle class 
families should be cut outright, but at a time of austerity across 
Whitehall any attempt to target poorer children would come at a cost for
others.

She is also using Ofsted’s first annual lecture on early years to call for nursery staff to be better trained to look after young children.

‘All those working with young children should be highly skilled and qualified to degree level,’ Ms Gregory said.

‘If we’re serious about investing in a better-qualified workforce we should pay more. Nursery staff wages often hover around the minimum and even a graduate early years professional earns only half a teacher’s salary.’

At the moment, individuals need higher grades to train to work as a veterinary assistant than to work with young children, she says.

Any attempt to increase the entry-level requirements for nursery workers would push up costs.

A Government-commissioned review published in June concluded that qualifications for childminders and nursery staff are failing to provide the knowledge and skills needed to care and teach young children.

It called for a major revamp of the system with all staff educated to A-level standard.

Students should also have to have English and maths at GCSE level before they begin an early education or childcare course, the Nutbrown review said.

A Department for Education spokesman said: ‘All three and four-year-olds are already entitled to free early education.

‘We are expanding this entitlement so that around 130,000 two-year-olds will have 15 hours of free early years education from next September, doubling to more than a quarter of a million two-year-olds from September 2014.

‘We want to improve the quality of early education and childcare qualifications. We asked Professor Cathy Nutbrown to look at this and we will respond to her recommendations shortly.’
