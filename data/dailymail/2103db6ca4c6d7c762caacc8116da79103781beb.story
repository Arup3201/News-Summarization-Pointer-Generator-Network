A teenager has undergone surgery after being beaten unconscious by a fellow student in an incident of school bullying.

The argument between Preston Hodge and a classmate reportedly broke out on Tuesday during lunch break in the playground when the boys were playing dodgeball.

A teacher broke up the fight at Longfellow Middle School in Enid, Oklahoma but it was unclear how long the beating had gone on for.

The student was battered unconscious and suffered broken bones, 
severe lacerations and possible internal injuries, according to KFOR-TV.

The 14-year-old had a plate inserted in his fractured cheek yesterday. He was said to be in a 'fair' condition by hospital staff.

The attack at Longfellow Middle School was 'a hate/bias incident' according to the campus police report.

According to school authorities, 
there had been pushing and shoving between the two students and an 
exchange of insults before the attack took place.

Although the child's mother had yet to speak publicly, she posted a picture of her badly injured son on Facebook. According to News on 6, she commented: 'This happened at Longfellow and have no idea where the teachers were at.'

Shawn Hine, the superintendent of Enid Public Schools also told the local station: 'Nothing is more important than the safety of our students.'

The school was cooperating with a police
 investigation against the unnamed student - who could face aggravated battery charges.Â 

Family friend Jeff Rust had organised a fundraising drive for Preston on Facebook to help with medical expenses.

Mr Rust wrote on Facebook: 'I wanted people to see the effect of bullying in schools and having a daughter in junior high it really hit home.'
