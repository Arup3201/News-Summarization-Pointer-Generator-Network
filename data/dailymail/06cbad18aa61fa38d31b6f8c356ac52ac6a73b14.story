Rebekah Brooks asked for her office to be 'discreetly' swept for bugs, the hacking trial heard today.

In January 2011, months before the closure of the News of the World and her resignation as chief executive of News International, Brooks emailed a request copying in former head of security and co-defendant Mark Hanna.

It read: 'Can you have my office swept... thanks. Discreetly.'

The court heard that the News International offices were swept regularly for listening devices, especially during their bid for the takeover of BSkyB in 2011, to ensure that rival journalists or companies could listen in on private discussions.

Co-defendant Mark Hanna was News Corp head of security during 2011, and was in charge of sweeping the building for covert listening devices.

William Clegg QC, defending Hanna, claimed that these sorts of sweeps were a regular occurrence.

Clegg said: ‘Offices were swept on various occasions to ensure no listening devices were in the executive offices or suites, which was perfectly normal and routine.

‘There were a number of reasons for that, one obviously was newspapers are very competitive with each other, and some journalists may be anxious to try to steal a scoop from a rival.

‘One of the reasons for the sweeps was to avoid that possibility.

‘In 2011, News Corp was trying to increase its shareholding in BSkyB, I think with the objective of becoming the majority shareholder.

‘It was a sensitive topic at News Corp, and another reason why you would want to be sure discussions about such a matter were not broadcast to people who were potential competitors.’

The sweeps were carried out by a contractor called White Rock, under the direction of Hanna.

Jane Viner, News International group director for property and facilities said that request was ‘a perfectly routine request from an executive.’

'It was normal and routine, as in other news organisations I have worked in.

Hanna, who served in the first Gulf war, was also in charge of preparing journalists to work in a war zone, and dealing with hate mail that was sent to the News International offices when the hacking scandal broke in 2011.

Brooks had been sent 'threatening mail' during 2011 as hacking allegations emerged, she also told the Old Bailey trial.

Abusive mail was usually intercepted in the post room and, if it got through the first check, it would be picked up by personal assistants, she said.

The court heard that, at the time, security around key executives had been stepped up.

Clegg said: 'The security risk had never been higher' than in July 2011, when protection detail was set up for Rebekah Brooks and two other people who worked at the company.

Brooks was codenamed 'Blackhawk' by security, while the other two were named 'Kestrel' and 'Sparrowhawk'.

The court also heard today that Brooks' PA Cheryl Carter was arrested as she was planning to

emigrate to Australia.

She was arrested at 6.50am on 6 January 2012, a fortnight before she was due to move to Perth, where she had a job with the Murdoch-owned Perth Times.

When questioned about the timing of the arrest, considering Carter had been co-operating as a witness to the investigation, DS John Massey said: 'It was identified in a decision taken with the senior investigating officer that she was likely to leave for Australia very soon.

When asked why she had been arrested at 6.50am he said: 'it was to give her a full day's interview, which would not be possible if arrested late in the afternoon or evening.

'At ten to seven, there was no chance of her leaving for work, and it was not an ungodly time of day.

'It seemed a sensible time for the arrest.'

The court heard Carter told police about boxes of material belonging to brooks being held by the solicitors Kingsley Napley.

The jury were told that upon investigation, the boxes were found by DS Massey to contain Brooks' personal items, such as photo albums, letters to The Sun and The News of the World and letters of congratulation on her promotion.

In addition, one box was labeled 'Mr. Murdoch 2000 - 2008, and another was labeled 'media intrusion'.

DS Massey also said that he found diaries dated 1995 to 2010, four A5 notebooks, a small reporters pad and two filofaxes, but the officer told the court that none of the boxes were from the News International archive.

Later, the jury was shown CCTV footage from the Brooks' London home in Chelsea Harbour.

Shortly after Rebekah Brooks was arrested by police, her husband is seen entering the building and then exiting an underground car park holding a jiffy bag and a laptop.

Within a minute, he returns to the building empty handed.

Former NotW and Sun editor Brooks, 45, of Churchill, Oxfordshire, and Hanna deny a charge of conspiracy to pervert the course of justice.

All seven defendants in the case, including Brooks’ husband Charles Brooks, Cheryl Carter, Stuart Kuttner, Clive Goodman and Andy Coulson, deny all the charges.

The trial was adjourned into 10am tomorrow when a police officer in the case will give evidence.
