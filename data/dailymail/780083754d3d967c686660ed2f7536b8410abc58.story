They are one of the most iconic symbols of British independence and the inspiration for one of the most famous wartime songs.

But walkers have been warned to take care when walking along a stretch of the famous White Cliffs of Dover after tonnes of chalk crashed into the English Channel when part of the cliff-face sheared off.

A giant mound of clay was left on the shore near St Margaret's Bay after the collapse between between Dover and Deal in Kent.

Dover Coastguard said a bench and fencing which sat on the cliff-top were also sent tumbling to the base, prompting warnings to coastal walkers.

Fortunately, no one was hurt.

The collapse is thought to have been caused by a combination of high winds and rain freezing after being absorbed into the chalk and then expanding, causing the cliff to weaken.

A similar collapse saw a chunk of the cliff-face slip in March last year.

A Dover Coastguard spokesman said: 'There was a similar fall in 2012 but this one is smaller than that one. A bench and fence have gone down with it.

'Coastguard rescue officers were tasked to make an assessment of the area and take some pictures which were sent off to the relevant authorities.

'The cliff-fall extends about 150 yards from the base of the cliff towards the sea at ground level, and the fall is about 15ft to 20ft high.'

On a clear day you can see right across from the Dover cliffs to the cliffs on the French coast at Cap Gris Nez, proof of the continuous strata of chalk.

About 70million years ago this part of Britain was submerged by a shallow sea.

The sea bottom was made of a white mud formed from the fragments of coccoliths - the skeletons of tiny algae which floated in the surface waters of the sea.

This mud became the chalk. It is believed to have been deposited very slowly, probably only half a millimetre a year.

In spite of this, up to 500 metres of chalk were deposited in places.

The coccoliths are too small to be seen without a microscope but if you look carefully you can find fossils of some of the larger inhabitants of the chalk sea such as sponges, shells, ammonites and urchins.

The National Trust, which owns the land, were told of the collapse and have put up signs warning walkers to beware.

A National Trust spokesman said: 'This
 cliff fall is part of a process of natural regeneration that happens on
 this world famous stretch of the Kent coast, helping to keep this 
special place, recognised by millions across the world, so distinctive.

'We’ve installed signs and information to help keep access open to this British icon.

'Throughout the year we closely monitor how the elements affect the chalk cliffs, helping us to manage the coastal footpath.'

The Kent landmark, immortalised by Dame Vera Lynn’s wartime song The White Cliffs of Dover, has suffered large falls before, and is thought to recede by around half an inch each year.

Experts believe that the cliffs could move up to 200 yards further away from France by the end of the century.

Parts of the cliffs are now supported by concrete.

The chalk cliffs have stood over dramatic moments in English history, including the first arrival of the Romans and the return of British forces rescued from Dunkirk in the Second World War.

They are also home to a rich array of wildlife such as the Adonis blue butterfly and peregrine falcons, Kent’s only kittiwake, and plants including oxtongue broomrape and sea carrots.

Last year, the National Trust, which owns five miles of the white cliffs, successfully raised money to buy a mile of the coastline from a private owner in a campaign backed by celebrities including Dame Judi Dench, singer Joss Stone and chef Rick Stein.

More than 16,000 people and organisations backed the appeal, which was launched in June last year and saw an average donation of £40.21, including Gift Aid, from members of the public.
