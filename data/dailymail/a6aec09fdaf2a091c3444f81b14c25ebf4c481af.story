The British public are overwhelmingly in favour of clawing back a wide range of powers from Brussels.

And a clear majority say that we should refuse to sign any new EU treaty until that happens.

According to an exclusive poll for the Daily Mail, more than two-thirds believe the European Union has become over-mighty and want the Prime Minister to start repatriating powers on everything from immigration and human rights to employment law and fishing policy.

Food for thought: The British public are overwhelmingly in favour of clawing back a wide range of powers from Brussels, according to an exclusive poll for the Daily Mail

Among Tory voters, almost 90 per cent want repatriation, with 60 per cent believing negotiations on the issue should begin immediately.

And across supporters of all parties, a mere 13 per cent share the view of Ed Miliband and Nick Clegg that Brussels does not have too much power and that reform is unnecessary.

There is also broad support for a referendum on Britain’s continuing membership of the EU, with those in favour outnumbering opponents by more than two to one.

Worryingly for Mr Cameron, most of those polled believe the 81 Eurosceptic MPs who rebelled in the Commons this week are ‘more in tune with Tory voters’ than the Prime Minister.

Three-quarters said rebel MPs were right to defy his three-line whip. Mr Cameron admitted yesterday that he must ‘work harder’ to persuade his backbenchers he is on their side.

The Daily Mail has learned that he has ordered every Whitehall department to draw up a list of powers to be grabbed back from Brussels.

But rebel Tories said the poll findings showed Mr Cameron had to move further and faster.

Philip Davies said public pressure for a referendum was becoming ‘unstoppable’.

He added: ‘This poll confirms that the European issue is not going to go away. The voting public are massively unhappy about the damage the EU is doing to the economy and our country.

‘The Prime Minister says now is not the time to talk about Europe because of the need to fix the economy. But the public see the two things going hand in hand - we cannot fix the economy until we get out of the claws of Brussels, which is bleeding us dry.

‘The Prime Minister needs to reflect that feeling and go to Brussels and say that unless they start giving us back some meaningful powers then this week’s vote in the Commons will come to be seen as the first step on a path to us leaving the EU.’

In a sign of the Coalition tensions over the issue, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg yesterday pledged to block the idea of repatriating powers from Brussels. ‘That simply isn’t on the cards,’ he said. ‘It wouldn’t work, it’s not possible.'

Despite Mr Clegg’s opposition to the idea, the Harris Interactive survey found that 68 per cent of Lib Dem voters polled also want to see Brussels cut down to size.

Tory Peter Bone said the time had come for the Prime Minister to face down his Coalition partners. ‘The fact that people are coming to see the Prime Minister as out of touch should worry him.

'There is always a danger that Prime Ministers become detached from what the public think. But in this case the real problem is that we are hogtied by the Lib Dems.

‘We cannot have a party that commands only eight per cent support in the polls having a veto on bringing powers back from Brussels.’

The poll findings came as it emerged that Mr Cameron has ordered ‘urgent’ work to draw up a comprehensive blueprint that he can take to Brussels if eurozone countries seek a major change in the treaties which govern the EU.

A well-placed source told the Mail that the PM wants this work to be completed ‘very rapidly on what is the best way of maximising our national advantage’.

Senior officials say Mr Cameron is prepared to threaten to hold a referendum to get his way.

Coalition tensions: Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg yesterday pledged to block the idea of repatriating powers from Brussels

The Prime Minister opened a two-front war on Brussels yesterday, launching a broadside at the European Commission for making ‘daily attacks’ on the City of London.

He said work has begun to examine the balance of powers between London and Brussels - a pledge contained in the coalition agreement.

Senior sources say the work on repatriation of powers has gone much wider than previously admitted. Ministers have previously conceded only that employment laws and fisheries policy are under the spotlight.

The project being coordinated by the Foreign Office includes every single government department. They have all been asked to draw up details of the ‘risks and opportunities that could arise if there is a renegotiation of treaties’.

The blueprint will also cover the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights, which enshrines much of the European Convention on Human Rights - which has led the courts to make controversial rulings in favour of foreign prisoners in deportation cases.

Senior officials expect there to be a minor revision of the treaties in December - but they believe making major demands at that point would endanger the Euro and the British economy with it.

That is bound to disappoint Tory Eurosceptics and the public.

But senior sources say a major treaty revision will be necessary as early as next year, with a full-blown inter-governmental conference to draw up a new set of rules to recognise the changed relationship between those inside and outside the eurozone.

Ladies man? Just 43 per cent of women say that they approve of the Prime Minister, pictured with his wife Samantha

David Cameron’s support among women is slipping away, with just 43 per cent saying that they approve of the Prime Minister.

The Harris Interactive survey for the Daily Mail has revealed a growing divide between the sexes, with 54 per cent of men saying that Mr Cameron is doing a good job.

The figures will fuel fears among senior Tories that the Coalition, and Mr Cameron in particular, has a ‘woman problem’.

Most worryingly for the Prime 
Minister is that half of all women between 45 and 54 said they thought 
the Prime Minister was doing a bad job.

The
 survey follows a poll earlier in the month which found that one in four
 voters believe Mr Cameron’s attitude to women is ‘sexist’. Tory 
strategists are concerned that the Coalition’s cuts are seen as 
particularly harmful to women, with recent figures showing that the 
number of unemployed women has reached a million.

Mr
 Cameron’s standing with women has not been helped by controversial 
calls from his policy guru Steve Hilton to scrap maternity pay.

A
 leaked report of the Beecroft report, commissioned by the PM, is said 
to suggest that Mr Cameron scale back on his pledges to extend flexible 
working rights. Concerns over Tories’ loss of female support has 
prompted Mr Cameron to go on a charm offensive in recent weeks.

He
 made a grovelling apology to two female MPs whom he was accused of 
dismissing with sexist put-downs in the House of Commons, admitting he 
had ‘screwed up’.

The 
Prime Minister wrote to bosses of some of the UK’s top companies warning
 them that they must do more to promote women into senior positions. He 
also elevated Justine Greening into the Cabinet after Liam Fox’s 
resignation.
