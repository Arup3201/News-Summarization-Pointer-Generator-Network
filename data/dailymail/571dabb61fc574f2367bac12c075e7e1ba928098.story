You'd be forgiven for thinking these snaps capture a particularly murky water park.

But this is not a swimming pool, it is a poor mother's back garden.

Alison Jones, 37, says an engineering blunder has caused overflowing water from a small stream to flood her lawn, immersing her children's toys in dirty water.

Transport misery: A commuter line is being extended into the area close to Alison Jones's home, as part of the £1.4bn 'Big Bang' tram expansion

Mother Alison Jones is furious after she says an engineering blunder has caused a stream to overflow into her garden, turning it into a swimming pool

Swimming pool: Ms Jones says her back garden had never previously flooded in the ten years she has lived in the property

She says Metrolink contractors are to blame as they work on building a substation near to her family home in Wythenshaw, Greater Manchester, as part of plans to extend the line to the town.

Although her home is next to a small stream, she says despite heavy rain, her back garden has never flooded since she moved in a decade ago.

The flooded garden with all the children's toys moved to one side

Since the work started, however, she claims it has flooded three times in heavy rain, stopping her two boys, Luke, three and Daniel, eight, from playing outside.

She said: 'Since Metrolink
began working in the woods next to my house, my garden has flooded in 
heavy rain.

'The water is up to my knees. It has happened three times 
now. I have two young children and since the first flood I will not let 
them play out as I’m not sure if it’s just rain or is from the drains.

'I have contracted Metrolink and they came back saying its nature. I’ve lived here 10 years and have never experience anything like this. It’s awful.

'The lawn and the children’s 
playhouse are waterlogged. I might have to throw away some of the 
playhouse toys. My plants have been ruined and its been really 
stressful.'

Ms
Jones's next-door neighbour, grandmother Marina Dickinson, 78, said: 
'I’ve lived here for 56 years and the only time the garden has flooded 
was when somebody threw an armchair in the gully. Since this work has 
started, my garden has flooded twice.'

The Environment Agency said it planned to visit Ms Jones’s home to discuss the problem.

Paul Goggins, MP for Wythenshawe and Sale East, is also looking into the issue.

The line to Wythenshawe and Manchester Airport is due to open in 2016 as part of the £1.4bn ‘Big Bang’ tram expansion.

A spokeswoman for Transport for Greater Manchester, which owns the tram network, said: 'Our contractors have not changed or altered the water course of the brook next to Brownley Road, or done any work that has affected its banks or flow.

'Ms Jones’s home does lie within the natural flood plain, which means it would be susceptible to flooding in certain weather conditions - even if these conditions haven’t occurred before during her time at the property.'
