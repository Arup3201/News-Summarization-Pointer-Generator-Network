Apes throw a strop if they lose a bet, reveals a new study.

Researchers discovered chimpanzees and bonobo monkeys exhibit emotional responses to outcomes of decision-making.

Like some humans, chimpanzees and bonobos pout or throw angry tantrums when a risk-taking strategy fails to pay off, according to research.

American researchers Alexandra Rosati, of Yale University, and Brian Hare, of Duke University, assessed the emotional responses and motivation of chimpanzees and bonobos living in African sanctuaries.

These chimpanzees were study subjects at the Tchimpounga Chimpanzee Sanctuary in Pointe Noire, Republic of Congo. Researchers discovered chimpanzees and bonobo monkeys exhibit emotional responses to outcomes of decision-making.

Doctor Rosati said: 'Psychologists and economists have found that emotions play a critical role in shaping how humans make complex decisions, such as decisions about saving or investing money.

'But it was not known if these processes are shared with other animals when they make decisions about their important resources - such as food.'

The apes in the study faced two different types of problems: one where they made choices about whether to wait to obtain larger rewards, and one where they made choices about whether to take a chance to obtain a high-quality treat, but risk obtaining a non-preferred food item if their gamble did not pay off.

The scientists found that both species displayed emotional responses to the outcome of their choice, but chimpanzees were more patient and likely to take risks than bonobos.

When their choice yielded the less preferred outcome, both species displayed negative emotional responses including vocalizations similar to pouts and moans, scratching, and banging - a type of tantrum thought to reflect anger in apes.

In the risky choice task, the apes even tried to switch their choice after the fact when they realised they had made a losing gamble, but never did so when their risk-taking paid off.

Some of the emotional and motivational responses displayed by the apes were species-specific while others reflected individual differences in the animals.

Based on their results, published in the journal PLOS ONE, the researchers concluded that apes do exhibit emotional responses to decision-making, like humans.

They said that further research is needed to determine whether these emotional responses to outcomes can change the apes' future choices and decisions.
