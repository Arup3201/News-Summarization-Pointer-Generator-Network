Pope Francis has laid the groundwork for another of his predecessors to move towards sainthood after he approved a miracle.

Just weeks after the canonisation of John XXIII and John Paul II, he has officially confirmed a miracle credited to prayers made by Paul VI by a pregnant woman who feared losing her baby.

A date has now been set for beatification, the last formal step before possible sainthood.

One miracle is required for beatification, and traditionally a second for canonisation.

The
 Vatican, as is its custom, has not given details about the miracle 
which must be certified by doctors as having no medical explanation.

But
 Italian media have reported that the miracle was that of a boy born 
healthy in California despite the diagnoses in 2001 of the rupture of 
the fetal bladder and absence of amniotic liquid.

The mother reportedly refused an abortion and prayed for Paul VI's intercession at the urging of a nun.

The baby was born a month prematurely and is now a healthy adolescent, the news reports said.

During his pontificate from 1963 to 1978,
 Paul made landmark progress in improving Catholics' relationship with 
other Christians.

But he disappointed many Catholics who were hoping for liberalisation of church teaching on sexuality.

After
 much consultation and, reportedly, personal anguish, Paul VI enshrined 
the church's teaching against artificial contraception in the 1968 
encyclical 'Humanae Vitae' ('of human life').

The
 issue is among many expected to get scrutiny in a special meeting of 
bishops called at the Vatican in October to discuss family life. The 
beatification ceremony would come at the end of the gathering.

Like John Paul II, Paul VI was hard to peg as progressive or conservative. Both were conservative on sexual issues, but enthusiastically embraced the thrust toward ecumenism set in motion by the Second Vatican Council.

Vatican II opened the way for Mass to be said in local languages instead of in Latin.

Its reforms also inspired many nuns, especially in the United States, shed their long robes in favor of knee-length skirts and abandoned the head-coverings that were their orders' dress code for centuries.

Paul, who like John Paul took up traveling to distant lands, ended nearly a millennium of estrangement between Catholics and Orthodox Christians when he journeyed to Jerusalem in 1964 and embraced Patriarch Athengoras, then the Orthodox leader.

Paying tribute to that gesture, Francis later this month will go to Jerusalem and pray together with the current Ecumenical Patriarch, Bartholomew I.

Paul VI disposed of many of the privileged trappings of the papacy, anticipating Francis' disdain for stuffiness and fanciness at the Vatican.

Paul got rid of scores of Italian nobles from the papal 'court' who had privileges dating back centuries.

He still allowed use of the papal throne, and looked frail and uncomfortable as he arrived for the funeral of assassinated Italian politician Aldo Moro in Rome in 1978 in the chair perched on the shoulders of 12 men.

He was under fire from the Moro family who thought he didn't do enough to save the leader despite having made a public plea 'on my knees' for Moro's release by Red Brigades kidnappers.

On April 27 this year, Pope Francis proclaimed two other 20th century predecessors, John Paul II and John XXIII, the Catholic Church's newest saints as almost a million pilgrims flocked to the streets of Vatican City.

It was the first time that two popes had been made saints at the same time.
