The Today show has denied rumors that Natalie Morales is looking for new roles after falling out with fellow co-host Tamron Hall.

The morning show's co-host was reportedly considering a move because of the 'tense atmosphere' behind the scenes, Page Six reported.

NBC News President Deborah Turness has not spoken to Morales 'in months' and is looking to promoting Hall to a bigger role over her, according to the newspaper.

Hall and Morales fell out last month, according to a source.

'Falling out': NBC sources have claimed that Natalie Morales, left, and Tamron Hall, right, have fallen out and that Morales is looking for roles elsewhere due to the backstage tension - but NBC has denied the reports

'Passed over': Morales has been at the Today show since 2006 but Savannah Guthrie, in pink, joined the show in 2012 and took the top anchor spot. They are pictured with Matt Lauer and Al Roker

'There's a lot of tension,' a source reportedly told the paper. 'It's the talk of NBC staff.'

The source added that Morales met with the show's executive producer Don Nash but that she didn't get the reassurance she had been hoping for.

Morales joined the Today team in 2006 as a national correspondent but she has missed out on being the top anchor, including when Ann Curry left in 2012.

Following Curry's emotional exit after just a year in the job, she was replaced by Savannah Guthrie.

But other sources told the paper that Natalie still has two more years on her contract so will not be leaving any time soon. 

'This is total nonsense,' Don Nash said of the reports.

'As the Today show continues to gain momentum, it sounds like someone is trying to stir up trouble that doesn't exist.

'Natalie Morales is valued by everyone at the news division from the top down, and her future is with the Today show and NBC News.'

Over the summer, it emerged that Matt Lauer - who was implicated in Curry leaving the show after just a year - has agreed to extend his contract. 

Despite Lauer's popularity taking a plunge after Curry's departure, NBC's own research showed that losing Lauer would be much more damaging, and his bosses let him know he was still wanted.

NBC said Lauer's extension was for multiple years, although it would not specify how long. Terms weren't disclosed.

He began as a news anchor on 'Today' in 1994 and replaced Bryant Gumbel as co-host three years later.

He's worked with Katie Couric, Meredith Vieira, Curry and now Savannah Guthrie as co-hosts.
