Cristiano Ronaldo became the joint third highest scorer in Real Madrid’s history on Sunday night with his 290th goal as Los Blancos saw off Elche 2-0.

Karim Benzema put Real ahead in the 56th minute with a scrappy opening goal before Ronaldo headed in his 38th goal of the season with half an hour of the contest remaining.   

The three-time Ballon d'Or winner is now level with Galacticos legend Carlos Santillana.

Raul: 323 goals in 741 appearances

Alfredo Di Stefano: 307 goals in 392 appearances

Cristiano Ronaldo: 290 goals in 281 appearances

Carlos Santillana: 290 goals in 645 appearances

Ferenc Puskas: 242 goals in 262 appearances 

Santillana scored 290 goals in 645 games from his debut in 1971, but Ronaldo has finally drawn level.

Amazingly, it took Ronaldo just 281 matches to achieve the same feat as Santillana for Madrid. 

Ronaldo is now just 17 goals behind second placed top scorer Alfredo Di Stefano and 33 behind all-time leader and club legend Raul.

Sunday's victory puts Real four points clear of Barcelona at the top of La Liga after Luis Enrique's side slipped up 24 hours earlier against Malaga.
