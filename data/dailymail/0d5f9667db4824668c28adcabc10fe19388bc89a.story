Tax breaks for married couples should be more generous and be introduced well before the general election, says Lord Lawson.

Margaret Thatcher’s Chancellor endorses the principle of David Cameron’s plan for transferable tax allowances worth up to £200 a year.

But he says the tax break should be extended and must come into effect earlier than the start date announced by the Government, which is April 2015 – just one month before the election – to avoid the risk of it being rolled back by Labour.

Lord Lawson has said marriage tax breaks should be more generous and be introduced earlier than David Cameron has previously announced

The Prime Minister last month announced plans that would allow a husband or wife to transfer £1,000 of their tax-free personal allowance to their spouse.

It would apply if couples are both basic rate taxpayers with one spouse earning less than the allowance. Gay couples in civil partnerships would also be eligible.

Around four million people are expected to benefit but Lord Lawson says it should be more generous.

More than a million married couples will gain only £1.35 a week from David Cameron’s tax break – a third of the amount promised.

The Prime Minister said ‘most’ couples eligible under the scheme would gain £200 a year but a report by economists says many are likely to pick up only £70 extra, including most of those with children.

From April 2015, married couples and civil partners who are not higher rate taxpayers can transfer £1,000 of their tax-free allowance to their spouse or partner.

However, the Resolution Foundation think tank says the tax break will be undermined by Universal Credit.

Devised by Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith, it will come into force in 2017 and replace some benefits paid to working couples.

Unlike current benefits, it will be based on family income after tax.

As a result, much of the money that couples gain through the tax break will be lost due to reduced Universal Credit payments.

The report says 2.7million working couples will benefit from the new allowance, but 1.1million will get only £1.35 after benefits have been reduced.

Around 900,000 of those will have children. Only 600,000 couples with children will get the full £3.85.

‘It’s understandable that it is only introduced at the level which has been proposed at the present time,’ he said last night.

‘But once it’s up and running that gives us the opportunity to ask for it to be increased subsequently.’He also said that it should be introduced earlier, otherwise it would be easier for Labour to reverse the measure if they won the election in 2015.

‘I’m sure it will be in the next Finance Bill but the question is over the start date,’ said Lord Lawson.

‘I think it should be up and running during the lifetime of this Parliament. It makes it easier to reverse it if it’s not up and running because you’re not taking anything away from people that they already have.’

Some Tories have called for the tax break to be extended to all married couples and for the £1,000 transferable allowance to be increased.

Lord Lawson will speak today at the publication of a report entitled ‘Independent Taxation – 25 years on, Does it meet today’s needs?’

In 1988 he was the first Chancellor to give married women an individual tax status. He proposed transferable allowances between married couples but his were plans were not implemented.

The report was sponsored by the Christian charity CARE and concludes that the benefits of independent taxation have been undermined by the failure to include transferable allowances.

Lord Lawson describes such allowances as ‘family-friendly’. He says they also a more cost-effective means of reducing the tax burden on low-income households than across-the-board increases in personal allowances.

In today’s speech he is expected to criticise Nick Clegg for delaying the measure because he does not support the plans.

‘I think it’s well known that they have been foot-dragging, for reasons which I think are wholly without merit,’ he says.

A Downing Street spokesman said the Prime Minister’s plans show that the Government ‘values commitment’.
