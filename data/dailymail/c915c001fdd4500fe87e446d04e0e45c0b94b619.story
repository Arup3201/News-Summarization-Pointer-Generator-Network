A girl of six has helped evict an 'unbearably' noisy neighbour after drawing a crayon picture of their adjoining homes with the caption: 'New house gangs and loud music.'

The 'heart-breaking' drawing, which the girl had done for a school project about her life, was presented as evidence at an eviction hearing which resulted in the troublesome family being moved from the semi-detached house in Moston, Manchester.

The primary school pupil drew the picture of barmaid Maria Jiminez's house as part of a series of pictures of events in her life - others featured herself as a baby, her pet dog, and her mother's new car.

'Gangs and loud music': The child's drawing that was used as evidence in the fight to have Maria Jiminez evicted

Neighbours said Jiminez, who lived in the house on the right, held all-night parties that often ended in fighting

The child's teacher asked her about the drawing of new home and the house next door with a red scribble through it, and was shocked when the girl told her about large groups of people gathering at the house and rowdy behaviour.

The teacher was so concerned she brought it up with her mother at a parent-teacher evening.

That sparked an 11-month campaign to get Jiminez, 45, and her two sons kicked out of her rented semi-detached in Moston, Manchester.

Today residents in the street spoke of their relief after Jiminez and her two sons were ordered to leave the property after the child's drawing was used in evidence.

Louise Thomas, 37, who moved into the street in May 2011, said the family's behaviour made life 'unbearable' for her family.

She said: 'We moved in on the Thursday and that Saturday there was music and loud banging until 5am.

'They used to cut through gardens, urinate in our gardens, shout abuse up at the house and at my kids, jump on our cars, it was horrendous.

'My children were having to sleep in earmuffs and I think it's important to stand up to people like that.'

Jiminez who is thought to have moved into the property in 2006, held a string of wild parties despite repeated warnings by her landlords about her unruly household.

Neighbours were kept awake by all-night parties, which often ended with fighting in the street.

Children living near the property had to stack pillows against the walls to muffle the noise, and wear earmuffs so they could sleep.

Another neighbour who asked not to be
 named said: 'Living near them was an absolute nightmare. I lived on the 
street since 1985 but I think they must have moved in about 10 years 
ago.

'They were okay at first but soon 
after there was just trouble. They would have all sorts of fancy cars 
parked up outside at all hours and there were all sorts going in and 
out of the house.

'The
 area has gone downhill because of that family. They are very cocky and the general ambiance with them there was horrible.'

'Heart-breaking': The child drew her noisy neighbours alongside pictures of her as a baby and her pet dog

Jiminez was first taken to court by 
officers from Northwards Housing in December 2012 and was served an 
injunction demanding she stop the noise.

When it continued, officers started legal proceedings for an eviction.

In
 August this year, Jiminez was handed a suspended possession order, 
which meant that she could be evicted if the nuisance continued.

But the order was breached within a month, so officers went back to court to apply for a warrant to evict her.

The warrant to kick her out of the house was issued at Manchester Civil Justice Centre last Wednesday.

Northward Housing's Mike Stevens said: 'Our quick-thinking officers were able to take legal action by using this heart-breaking drawing as evidence and we are delighted that the courts were able to act to rid this neighbourhood of such a selfish and anti-social character.'
