'Industrial accident': A sailor has died after falling down a lift shaft and becoming trapped inside on board the Royal Navy's flagship, HMS Bulwark

Paramedics treated a man for head injuries but he died from his wounds at the scene.

The police, the Navy and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) are all investigating the incident which is not being treated as suspicious.

It is believed the man, who has not been identified, was carrying out maintenance work when he fell down a lift shaft and became trapped.

'We were called to HMS Dockyard Devonport at 10:54am following a reported industrial accident on board HMS Bulwark,' said a spokesman from Devon and Cornwall Police.

'A crew member reportedly sustained injuries having been stuck in a lift shaft.

'Unfortunately this man died as a result of this incident.

'Police are investigating the death together with the Health and Safety Executive. It is not being treated as suspicious.'

A spokesman for South Western Ambulance Service said the initial 999 call was made at 9:53 am.

He said: 'We were called to Devonport, Plymouth, to reports of a male with a head injury.

'Unfortunately he died at the scene and there was nothing we could do for him. There were no other casualties.'

In the wake of the incident investigating police officers boarded HMS Bulwark, which is due to take part in training drills off the coast of Plymouth before heading to Scotland for a NATO exercise, Joint Warrior.

HMS Bulwark, which entered service
 in 2004, is one of the UK’s two newest amphibious transport docks 
designed to put personnel ashore by air and by sea.

The Albion-class ship’s primary role is to take as many as 405 Royal Marines ashore using its landing craft and dock.

It also has an assault helicopter, which launches from a two-spot flight deck, and can carry as many as 31 large trucks and 36 smaller vehicles into battle.

Role: Last week the ship was involved events marking the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings, performing a gun salute and taking part on an amphibious demonstration at Southsea beach

Navy chiefs have mainly deployed the 19,560-tonne ship worldwide in counter-terrorism operations, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.

Last week the ship was involved events marking the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings, performing a gun salute and taking part on an amphibious demonstration at Southsea beach, before carrying UK veterans from Portsmouth to Normandy as part of a flotilla of international ships.

A Royal Navy spokesman said: 'We are investigating the circumstances of the incident and next of kin are being informed.'

The HSE added: 'Two inspectors have gone over to the site. Police will take the lead on this investigation.'

Devonport is one of three UK operating bases for the Royal Navy and the biggest naval base in Western Europe.

The 650-acre facility is also the sole repair and refuelling facility for the UK’s nuclear submarines.

It was the scene of another dangerous incident on March 14 when HMS Argyll accidentally fired a unarmed torpedo at the dock during a botched training drill.

Dubbed 'the proud flagship of the Royal Navy and the nation', HMS Bulwark entered service in 2004 and is one of the newest amphibious transport docks in the fleet.

The vessel was sent on it's maiden deployment to assist in counter-terrorist and counter-piracy missions, and became the Navy's flagship in 2011

The assault ship HMS Bulwark, whose home port is HMNB  Devonport, has the primary role of delivering Royal Marines ashore as quickly as possible, using  landing craft and dock, or by assault helicopter from the two-spot flight deck to move as many as 405 troops.

She can carry 256 troops with their vehicles and combat supplies, and this can be swollen up to 405 troops.

Her vehicle deck can be crammed with up to 31 large trucks and 36 smaller vehicles, such as Land Rovers and Vikings, and she can support two Chinook heavy-lift helicopters.

The ship and its landing craft can also be configured to transport armoured vehicles such as the Army's Challenger 2 Main Battle Tank.

Navy chiefs have mainly deployed the 
19,560-tonne ship, which has a crew of 325, worldwide in counter-terrorism operations, 
humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.

Last week the ship was involved events 
marking the 70th anniversary of the D-Day landings and carried a number of UK veterans from Portsmouth to Normandy.
