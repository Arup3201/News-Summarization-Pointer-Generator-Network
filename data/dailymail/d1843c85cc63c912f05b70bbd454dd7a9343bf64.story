BB creams have been a hot topic in the beauty industry over the last few years because of their promises to roll back the years.

First there were products containing wrinkle-busting ingredients for your skin, then anti-ageing unguents for your hair - and now there's even one for your nails.

American brand ORLY has launched what they say is an industry first with their BB creme for nails.

New concern: Now we have to worry about the ageing appearance of our nails but ORLY's creme promises to roll back the years

BB stands for blemish base and the facial creams are said to make your skin look younger, smoother and brighter. They double up as both a moisturiser and primer. Some even have sun protection.

ORLY has taken the multi-functional concept and applied it to nails with its new product - it will hit shelves in August at £15 a bottle.

It says the ingredients in its BB creme for nails - which include Hyaluronic Acid and Vitamin C - will prime, brighten and smooth nails.

It recommend applying two coats to bare nails to keep them hydrated and protected from UV rays. This should delay the process of nails becoming brittle as they age.

It is not intended to be used as a basecoat or topcoat with nail polish - but presumably regular use would encourage a smooth base for when varnish is applied.

Banish brittle nails: The new product promises to make nails look smoother and brighter

If you decide to keep your nails unpainted, the creme will give them a 'natural glow'.

But when we've already got facial wrinkles and greying, thinning hair to fret about, do we really need to worry about the effect of ageing on the appearance of our nails too?

Yes, says beauty blogger Really Ree who has welcomed the arrival of the product.

She writes: 'Personally, I get very excited by the way that skincare approaches are being applied to much more than just our skin. We can now have the same care for hair and nails too.

'I am thinking that a BB Cream for teeth is either on its way, or already exists. I have always wanted to look after my hair like I look after my skin, and it makes sense to do the same with nails too.'

She added: 'I have accepted that my hair ages just like my skin does, and I think I have always known that nails age, too. I just never really thought about trying to stop them.'

Shreya Patel, an expert at vanityvan.co.uk says that condition of our nails can say a lot about the rest of our body and we should be concerned about them ageing.

'Just as the body ages, nails do too. Changes are apparent in the skin, nails (fingers and toes) and hair. Just think of why doctors always examine your nails, or when you go into surgery.. They give away a lot.'

Shreya says that spotting signs of aging in your nails can be easier than it sounds and there are a few obvious things to look out for.

'Nails becoming brittle and change colour, the clarity on the nail is affected, while vertical ridges can form, and they become thinner and break more easily. They look drier and take longer to recover from any injury like bruising.'

Shreya believes that the ORLY BB Crème is a real innovation and could dramatically help change the health of our nails.

'There is nothing of this intensity on the market and why shouldn't there be? There are BB creams for the face - nails are also susceptible and people take them for granted.

'This is a  genius product for plumping the nail structure, whitening so to avoid the discolouration that comes with ageing, brightening so they look great with no nail varnish - even though it has a pearlescent sheen so can be worn alone.

'It also has smoothing and anti chip properties which, in the long run, will help people whose nails have been damaged by cheap nail enhancing, ageing and illness. Did I forget to mention it protects your nails from UV rays.'
