A forgotten grand altar tapestry made by injured soldiers during the First World War will return to St Paul's Cathedral after more than 70 years.

The poignant piece depicting the Holy Grail was painstakingly crafted by 133 casualties who had returned from the trenches,

Blinded, crippled and shell-shocked, they were lying in hospitals around Britain and were encouraged into embroidery by medics who hoped it would distract them and help them recover.

A stitch in time: When thousands of injured soldiers were sent home from the trenches of the First World War, many were so shell-shocked they could barely hold their cigarettes - but 133 contributed to this lost tapestry

Symbolic: The tapestry's five panels include the Holy Grail, representing suffering, flanked by two palm leaves

Religious: The tapestry, pictured left in use at the old high altar at St Paul's Cathedral before the Second World War when it was bombed, was stitched by 133 soldiers. One unidentified man is pictured at work on the piece

They created five individual panels, which were stitched together by the Royal School of Art Needlework a year after the war ended.

The finished work, a 3m-wide tapestry of the golden grail representing suffering and two palm leaves signifying victory, was presented to St Paul's and rested on the altar for several years.

But after the cathedral was bombed in the Second World War, the magnificent piece was put in a chest for safekeeping and remained there for more than seven decades.

It has now been restored and will be put on display in August to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the Great War.

It will remain on show for four years, the duration of the conflict.

The name of every shell-shocked soldier who worked on the altar piece was recorded in a gold-leafed book and St Paul's is hoping to track down surviving relatives.

Painstaking: The tapestry gained dust in a chest for more than seven decades and has now been restored

Then and now: St Paul's today and after it was hit in an air raid during the Blitz on London in April 1941

One of them was George Eades, who was blinded in France in 1917 but became a 'finished artiste' in embroidery at St Dunstan's Hospital for the Blind in Kensington, London.

The Reverend Canon Michael Hampel, precentor of St Paul's Cathedral, said: 'The hands that clung to life in the trenches of the First World War and which lifted the bodies of dead comrades into graves came home to craft this beautiful altar frontal.

'It is a symbol of faith despite everything and a deeply moving tribute to those who did not return.

'It is our privilege at St Paul's to let it stand as a memorial to the sacrifice, courage and legacy of a world at war and we are very keen to identify some of these men and learn of their stories.'

It is not known whether the work was originally commissioned by St Paul's, but the altar frontal was dedicated to the cathedral at a special service after the war had ended.

The Royal School of Needlework was the main driver behind the project.

The list of names, regiments and ranks, meanwhile, is being digitised so they and colourful illuminations which accompany them can be seen and searched via the cathedral website.
