Robin Doan awakened to her mother's screams and gunshots as she lay in bed inside her family's Texas Panhandle farmhouse. A few moments later she saw a bright flash.

A man had fired an AK-47 at her bed, but somehow the bullet missed her.

'I pretended I was dead the whole time,' she told a dispatcher during a frantic 911 call September 30, 2005. 'I'm 10 years old, and I don't know what to do. I'm scared.'

Nearly ten years on from that night when she played dead for two hours to survive, Robin, 19, is still haunted by what murderer Levi King did to her family as he methodically walked around her home, killing simply for fun.

Robin Doan: The sole survivor of the 2005 massacre of a Pampa farming family is haunted by the memory of her mother's screams and will tell her story on a CBS special to air on January 3

'Robin lives every day with thoughts of her mother's screams in her head,' said her aunt, Christy Powell in 2009 interview with the Associated Press.

This Saturday, CBS will air a special, Sole Survivor, which recounts the horrific events of that evening as King broke in and shot dead Robin's mother, 35-year-old Michell Conrad, who was six months pregnant, her father, 31-year-old Brian Conrad and her 14-year-old brother, Zach.

Viewers will see Robin describe how she was awakened by her mother's screams, then crouched by her bedroom door and heard gunshots, then heavy steps down the hallway.

She said she climbed back into bed and hid under the covers as she felt something whiz by her body. She then heard the person walk down the hall to her brother Zach's bedroom, followed by gunshots and a groan.

Robin said she heard the intruder go to the kitchen, where she heard him rattling around. She said she remained still and silent for a long time after the noise stopped and she thought it safe to emerge. Without checking the bedrooms, she took a cordless phone, went outside and called 911.

'I so hope my mom is not dead,' Robin told the dispatcher between sobs. 'I want my mommy. I want my mom.'

When she believed the intruder had left a few hours later, Robin grabbed the family's cordless phone and ran outside to her stepfather's pickup. It was a cold, fall morning and Robin feared the worst.

'I think I'm the only one alive,' she told the dispatcher.

The harrowing 911 tapes are testament to the terror felt by Robin when King broke into her Pampa home on a two-day killing spree in September 2005 that took him from Missouri to Texas.

Sentenced in 2009 to life imprisonment for the killing of Robin's family, King also pleaded guilty to the shooting deaths of Orlie McCool, 70, and his daughter-in-law Dawn McCool, 47, in rural Pineville, Missouri.

King drove Orlie McCool's pickup from Missouri to the Conrads' home in Texas.

King was caught the same night trying to re-enter the United States at the Mexican border in El Paso, Texas.

He claimed that he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and paranoid schizophrenia; he also has been told he was psychotic.

During his trial, prosecutor, Lynn Switzer told jurors that Robin and her family had 'no idea what was fixing to happen to them.'

She described how King, dressed in black and toting the AK-47, broke into the back door and immediately went to the master bedroom. He shot Brian Conrad three times and killed Molly, the family's dog, before turning to Michell Conrad, who began screaming, Switzer said.

'Her screams were cut short because the defendant put five rounds into her body,' Switzer said. 'Can you imagine what it would be like to be awakened like that?'

King then went to Robin's room and fired before walking to Zach's room and shooting three times.

Johnny Doan, Robin and Zach's father, testified that his daughter called him and said, 'Daddy, Daddy, they're all in the house and they've all been shot.'

Still to this day, Robin says birthdays are particularly hard.

'Even my birthday is hard because I don't like celebrating it without them,' Robin said to CBS. 'I just have those days where I want my mommy, or I want my stepdad, or I want my brother, and want things to go back to being normal, and you just can't help but burst out into tears.'

Under the agreement with Missouri prosecutors, King pleaded guilty to killing Orlie McCool, 70, and his 47-year-old daughter-in-law, Dawn McCool, in exchange for two consecutive life sentences with parole.

Their bodies were found by a relative in a rural Pineville, Mo., home on Sept. 30, 2005 - the same day authorities in Texas discovered the bodies in the Conrads' home. Missouri authorities said King left the state in Orlie McCool's pickup, driving south and then west before coming upon the Conrads' home.
