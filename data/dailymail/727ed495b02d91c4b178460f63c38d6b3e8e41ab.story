At a towering 6ft 6in tall Anthony Joshua could be forgiven for having his head in the clouds.

Reassuringly, Britain’s giant heavyweight hope has his feet planted more firmly on the ground than those already acclaiming him as the next Lennox Lewis or, even, the new Muhammad Ali.

While those extravagant comparisons are being tossed in his direction with such premature carelessness, Joshua himself is keeping his progress from Olympic gold medallist to prospective world heavyweight champion in rational perspective.

Anthony Joshua crushed Denis Bakhtov on Saturday night to claim the WBC International belt

‘The potential is there,’ he says, ’but it will take a lot more graft and grind to make the dream a reality.’

This Adonis has some wisdom to go with the muscle.

As he turns 25 this week, Joshua knows that the journey takes a darn sight longer than the nine fights totalling 25 ring minutes which constitute the first year of his professional career.

He is also aware that he will encounter along that road bigger, fitter, tougher and considerably more talented opponents than the portly old Kazakh he used as a punch bag at London’s O2 Arena on Saturday night.

‘Not everyone will fold like that under pressure,’ he says of Denis Bakhtov, whom he reduced to a bloody, albeit still standing, pulp inside two rounds.

Whether, next time out in November, the 39-year-old Michael Sprott will muster sterner defiance is debatable. But strictly in the context of Joshua’s learning curve –‘I’m just starting phase two of my development’ – that fight should provide more useful experience.

A truer litmus test could come from the fights which promoter Eddie Hearn is pondering for next year.

Should the Watford Goliath take on and defeat the two Davids of British heavyweight boxing – Price and Haye – in the first half of 2015, the gateway to Wladimir Klitschko could swing open.

Hearn has to weigh risk against reward, though.

Joshua is still a comparative novice. So while it is natural for the public to be excited about him, it is not yet the time to get carried away.

Former heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis has played down Joshua comparisons

Price is eager to collide with him as soon as possible, which is a warning of itself.

As Price says: ‘I don’t think they’ll take the chance of putting him in with me just yet.’

And what’s the rush?

The boxing fraternity are still trying to analyse the raw material which reinforces in the ring the affable nature of this most likeable contender.

There are hints of Lewis in the more aggressive of his work. There is also a bit of the young Frank Bruno in his vulnerability to a counter-punch, which is one remnant of his amateur days.

The hope is that young Joshua is very much in the process of becoming his own man.

London’s Lewis, still the last undisputed heavyweight champion of the world, says of the comparison with himself: ‘He’s not the next Lennox, he’s the first Anthony Joshua.’

Now that is the shrewdest compliment of them all.

Floyd Mayweather short of options

Floyd Mayweather continues to flaunt his money and to taunt Manny Pacquiao and Amir Khan.

His problem is trying to find opponents for his two fights next year who are as credible as the the PacMan and the Bolton speed merchant, as his father acknowledges.

Floyd Snr is risking the sack as his son’s trainer by admitting those two long-awaited blockbusters should happen.

‘I don’t know myself who I’ll fight next,’ says Mayweather as he sits in his Aladdin’s Cave in Las Vegas, up to his haunches in hundred dollar bills.

Perhaps his biggest fight is with himself. 

Jimmy Tibbs takes tough path to redemption

The road to redemption is never easy but the path chosen by Jimmy Tibbs – from violent thug to esteemed boxing trainer via jail and born-again Christianity – has been especially rough.

That journey from the gangland of London’s East End to the corner of the world championship ring is traced in blood, sweat, tears and anger through the 330 pages of his autobiography.

It is a small miracle that, given the benefit of his rediscovery of Jesus Christ, his testament ends in hope and inspiration.

The narrative is raw and. in principle. honest, even though there remains an element of denial about the validity of the 15 and ten-year prison sentences imposed on his father and himself, respectively, for their roles in the knife-wielding, gun-toting turf wars of the 60s - ‘We didn’t start it guv, we only took revenge.’

Witness to the respect in which a man of terrifying street violence has subsequently come to be held as a trainer is borne by the stable of fine fighters with whom he has worked – Charlie Magri, Michael Watson, Lloyd Honeyghan, Frank Bruno, Nigel Benn and now Billy Joe Saunders among them – and especially by the great Barry McGuigan providing the foreword to his life story

The strength of the book lies in the Damascan conversion of Tibbs to a more moral life and its body of evidence as to how the hardest game of all continues to offer salvation to those brave enough to climb from the gutter into the ring.
