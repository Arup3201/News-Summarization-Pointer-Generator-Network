Australian children are to be banned from blowing out candles together on birthday cakes – because they could be puffing germs onto one another.

And in what is seen as an attempt to ‘bubble wrap’ children, youngsters attending birthday parties will be told to take along individual cup cakes on which to place single candles.

The extraordinary new guidelines from the country’s National Health and Medical Research Council has provoked an angry response from parents who say that the ‘nanny state’ is trying to take all the fun out of birthday parties.

Even doctors say that the birthday rules are going to far – because children are also now expected to wash their hands before jumping into a sandpit to play with their friends.

Day care staff will also be instructed to wash toys, doorknobs floors and cushion covers every day to prevent the spread of germs.

The guidelines state that kids who want to blow out a candle at birthday parties should bring their own cupcakes to avoid blowing germs over one another when they puff on a shared cake.

‘Children love to blow out their candles while their friends are signing “Happy birthday”’ states a guidelines document from the research council.

But it adds: ‘To prevent the spread of germs when the child blows out the candles, parents should either provide a separate cupcake, with a candle if they wish, for the birthday child.’

Alternative, it says, enough cupcakes should be provided for the other children – or a large cake that can be cut up into portions and shared should be made available.

Turning to sandpits, the council says that children must wash their hands with alcohol sanitiser before and afterwards.

The guidelines have astonished Australian Medical Association president Mr Steve Hambleton.

‘If somebody sneezes on a cake, I probably don’t want to eat it either – but if you’re blowing out candles, how many organisms are transferred to a communal cake, for goodness sake?’ he told Sydney’s Daily Telegraph.

Mr Hambleton also attacked the new sandpit rules, saying that all that was necessary was for children to wash their hands before they ate.

‘It’s normal and healthy to be exposed to a certain amount of environmental antigens that building up our immune systems.

‘If you live in a plastic bubble you’re going to get infections (later in life) that you can’t handle,’ he told the paper.

Also attacking the ‘clean hands’ rules, Miss Gwynn Bridge, president of the Australian Childcare Alliance said she was certain parents did not disinfect the door handles at home every day.
