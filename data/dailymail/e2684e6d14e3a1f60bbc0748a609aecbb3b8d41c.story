An HIV-positive teenager has today called for lessons about the virus to become compulsory in all schools, claiming he learned nothing of it in sex eduction classes.

Luke Alexander has written an open letter to Education Secretary Michael Gove, declaring he 'did not know much' about the disease before contracting it.

The 19-year-old appeared on ITV's This Morning, where he called for greater awareness 12 months after he received his devastating diagnosis.

In his letter, published as a petition 
on the Change.org website, Mr Alexander claims the 'vast majority of 
young people today have little or no common knowledge', of the virus.

HIV-positive Luke Alexander is calling on Education Secretary Michael Gove to make HIV a compulsory part of sex education in all schools

He said: 'I myself strongly believe that if I had learnt about HIV during my secondary education, I might have avoided being infected with HIV myself at just 18 years old,' the Independent reported.

Mr Alexander, from Oldbury in the West Midlands, said education is vital if a younger generation are to be as aware of the condition as men who were exposed to the major awareness campaign of the 1980s.

He said: 'Before my diagnosis I didn't really know a lot about it (HIV).

'When they diagnosed me last year, my first reaction was "Oh my God, I'm going to die".

'I knew it existed but I didn't know a lot about treatment.'

Mr Alexander, who was around 13 when he came out as being gay, said he became sexually active at the age of 15.

When he turned 18 his life took a downwards turn. Having been made redundant, he turned to alcohol and recreational drugs.

Appearing on ITV's This Morning, the 19-year-old - who was diagnosed last year - said he learned very little about the virus at school, adding had he had more information he might not have contracted the illness

It was during that time, he says, that he 'went off the rails' becoming less careful in his sexual life, adding that he can 'count on one hand' the number of times he has practised unsafe sex.

Had he been told more about the dangers of HIV while at school, he claims it could have made a real difference.

The teenager said his sex education lessons at school had a tendency to focus on the dangers of becoming pregnant and contracting chlamydia, but missed out the link between wearing a condom and protecting against HIV and other infections.

'We did talk about condoms,' he said. 'But it was more in the context of getting pregnant and bacterial infections.

Mr Alexander said he wants to raise greater awareness, especially among young homosexual men

'We never really went into anything else. I have always known it was necessary (to use a condom) but it wasn't stressed (in the context of HIV).'

It was in April 2013, while he was in Manchester, that Mr Alexander first fell ill, showing the signs of HIV.

'All of a sudden I came down with a horrific fever, it was very instant, I had sweats and could not sleep.

'The next thing I knew I was off my food and very, very fatigued. It was awful.

'Before my diagnosis I didn't really know a lot about it. When they diagnosed me last year, my first reaction was "Oh my God, I'm going to die"'

'I found out later it was sero-conversion illness, where my body was trying to reject the virus.'

In May last year, Mr Alexander said he had a free sexual health test offered by a charity at the Birmingham Gay Pride event.

Thinking nothing of the tests, he said he was shocked when he received a call to say his results showed 'cause for concern'.

Enduring the 'worst five days' of his life, Mr Alexander was forced to wait for further test results before his diagnosis was confirmed, he was HIV positive.

Speaking about his experience of sex education at school, Mr Alexander said he did not 'get the information I felt I needed at the time'.

'Being gay, HIV is up there on the list of things affecting men across the world.

Dr Ranj Singh, who appeared alongside Mr Alexander, supported his call for greater awareness in schools

'We heard a lot about chlamydia and pregnancy but nothing in much depth, the teachers were embarrassed to talk about it.

'I felt they were speaking about it because they had to, because the government were telling them to.

'But it left no impression.'

He called for more information to be made available around treatment of the virus.

On diagnosis, Mr Alexander said he thought he would be resigned to a short, bed-ridden life in pain, facing stigma from society.

But the reality is very different, with great leaps forward in treatment during the 1990s and 2000s.

The 19-year-old now takes just one pill a day.

Dr Ranj Singh, who appeared on the show with Mr Alexander, said a survey by the National Aids Trust in April 2014 found the level of knowledge about HIV in young gay men is 'shockingly low' - and worse than in older men.

He said 100,000 people in the UK are living with the virus, though 20,000 of those are unaware they have the condition.

A Department of Education spokesman said: 'Pupils must learn about sexually transmitted infections such as HIV/AIDS as part of sex and relationship education.'
