Two nurses today admitted neglecting elderly patients at a scandal-hit hospital run by the Welsh NHS.

Natalie Jones, 40, and Lauro Bertulano, 45, pleaded guilty to falsifying medical records and wilfully neglecting patients at the Princess of Wales Hospital.

Another nurse Rebecca Jones, 30, has already pleading guilty after a police investigation into the falsification of patient notes at the 1,500-bed hospital at Bridgend, South Wales.

A total of 15 nurses from the same health board working in the Princess of Wales hospital and Morriston Hospital in Swansea have been suspended as part of an ongoing internal inquiry into neglect.

It follows by families whose elderly relatives have died after alleged 'neglect, poor care and mistreatment' at the Welsh NHS hospitals.

Natalie Jones, from Bridgend, pleaded guilty to the wilful neglect of two vulnerable patients 'lacking capacity' in September and October 2012.

Bertulano, also from Bridgend, pleaded guilty to the wilful neglect of six vulnerable patients between May and September 2012.

Cardiff Crown Court heard the two and Rebecca Jones admit the neglect of 82-year-old Lillian Williams weeks before her death at the hospital in November 2012.

Her son Gareth Williams, speaking after the court hearing in Cardiff today, said his family welcomed the guilty pleas - but said it had taken too long for the health board and police to take their complaints seriously.

He said: 'We feel absolutely devastated that these nurses were left on the ward with patients for months after the authorities had been alerted to what was going on in the Princess of Wales Hospital.

'They should never have been allowed to continue working for so long.'

Mr Williams said he alerted police and health chiefs in October 2012.

Rebecca Jones was not taken off her ward until May 2013, Lauro Bertulano was not stopped from working until August 2013 and and Natalie Jones was still working with patients until her arrest in March 2014. 

Fellow nurses Jade Pugh, 29, and Clare Cahill, 41, pleaded not guilty to wilful neglect at the same hospital. They will stand trial next year.
