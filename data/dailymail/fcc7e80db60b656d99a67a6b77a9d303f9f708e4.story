Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll has described Australia’s Jarryd Hayne as ‘an incredible athlete and a great competitor’ and the prospect of recruiting him is ‘an exciting thought.’

The NRL player’s manager says the Seahawks aren’t the only club showing an interest, claiming they are being flooded offers from NFL clubs interested in meeting Hayne.

‘There is literally hundreds of emails I am trying to answer,’ Hayne’s manager, Wayne Beavis, told SMH.

‘There are agents, there are clubs… You name it they are all here.

‘It’s massive, it has exceeded our wildest expectations… there is no shortage of people wanting to look after Jarryd.'

The 2014 Dally M Award winner announced his retirement from NRL, in the hope of establishing a career as an NFL player.

The NSW and Parramatta Eels fullback is expected to fly to Los Angeles next week to commence his training in preparation for the NFL Combine in February.

Hayne is already making headlines in the US, and the Seahawks coach was quizzed about Hayne during a media conference on Thursday.

NFL coach Pete Carroll did not rule out the possibility of signing the former NRL player but refused to go into specifics, explaining he was ‘afraid to mention anything’ due to contractual obligations'.

'He’s an incredible athlete and a great competitor which is the kind of stuff we like,' Carroll said.

‘I don’t think I’m able to talk about him as far as I know. We don’t want to mess it up,’ Carroll explained.

An emotional Hayne reflected on how he has played for the Eels since he was 13 and accomplished great things, such as buying his mother a house

However, Seahawks media team were quick to hose down rumours, claiming the coach was joking.

‘He doesn’t even know who the guy (Jarryd Hayne) is,’ said the Seahawk’s vice president of communications, Dave Pearson.

It’s claimed Carroll was told to expect questions about Hayne from Australian journalists before the press conference– but in reality, is totally unaware of the dual-Dally M winner.

However, Carroll spoke about length about Hayne's appeal. 

‘But I always thought it would be really cool to recruit down there (Australia) because there are some great players and it’s a great game,’ Carroll told the media conference. 

Speculation has mounted that the Seahawks have an invested interest in Hayne due to the NRL player’s rapport with the club.

In September, the 26-year-old visited the Seahawks’ facility, the Virginia Mason Athletic Centre.

The Seahawks coach praised Hayne for his ability and that the rugby league player’s abilities would translate well to American Football.

‘It’s a very physically demanding game and those guys have all the kinds of stuff we look for in our guys,’ Carroll said.

According to the coach, Carroll and Hayne did not meet when Hayne met with Seahawks staff in September.

Jarryd Hayne’s mother, Jodie has voiced her unwavering belief in her son.

‘He’ll make it for sure – but I’m his mum, I’m so biased!’ Ms Hayne told Nine News.

‘I reckon he’ll go unreal over there. But only time will tell.’

The 26-year-old and his mother have a very close bond, after a childhood spent in housing commissions. Hayne's number one ambition was to buy a house for his mother - which he achieved

At the press conference announcing his retirement, the 26-year-old explained that he always had one goal for his career.

‘My dream as a professional athlete was to buy my mum a house, and I did that,’ Hayne said.

His mother is thrilled that Hayne is able to achieve his dreams, after humble beginnings growing up in a housing commission.

‘Growing up we always had little houses. I used to sleep in the lounge room on a mattress so I could protect the kids, so if anybody came in I’d be the first one there,’ said Ms Hayne.

‘I am so happy for him, just to follow his dreams.

‘To watch his kick that ball around as a kid and now to go and do it – I am so excited for him.’
