Gangnam Style was the viral dance craze of 2012 and now it's a new year, there's a new viral dance craze - the Harlem Shake.

It is the latest dance 
meme taking the internet by storm following the huge success of K-pop 
rapper Psy’s smash hit.

The concept is simple -  the videos are about 30 seconds long and set to Harlem Shake by New York DJ Baauer.

New year, new craze: Gangnam Style was so 2012, and now it's a new year, there's a new viral dance craze - introducing Harlem Shake

Concept: Each clip typically begins with one person gently bopping alone for the first 15 seconds while everyone else in the room acts normal

Each clip typically begins with one person gently bopping alone for the first 15 seconds while everyone else in the room ignores them. 

Then the bass line drops and everyone goes wild, doing crazy dance moves around the room.

The song belongs to the trap genre of music and every video has put a different twist on the dance routine.

Many of the performers wear facemasks or helmets, strange costumes and fancy dress - there is commonly someone dancing in their underwear. 

Taking over: Office workers, university students and firemen have all paid tribute to the craze in videos which have racked up millions of hits online

Origins: Most internet users agree the credit for the craze belongs to Filthy Frank who posted DO THE HARLEM SHAKE online

Unlike Gangnam Style there are no specific dance moves, but most dancers perform crotch thrusts, waves their arms up and down, or stand on their hands.

'The Harlem Shake is a style of dance that involves pivoting the shoulder out while popping the other shoulder out at the same time,' explains Knowyourmeme.com

Videos of people doing the Harlem Shake have already racked up tens of millions of views.

Amusing: The song belongs to the 'trap' genre of music and every video has put a different twist on the dance routine, with many donning hilarious costumes, or even fancy dress

Getting dressed up: Fancy dress is a popular feature in many of the Harlem Shake videos

Office workers, university students, friends and firemen have all made their own short video clips and posted them on YouTube.

Some performers have even taken to the snow wearing little clothing to perform the famous dance.

A version apparently performed by Norwegian soliders has been one of the most popular.

Athough Baauer's song has been around for at least a year, the song has now gained international success thanks to the new craze. 

The Harlem Shake phenomenon has been around since the 1980s, but it was this recent meme which has catapulted it into mainstream culture across the world.

The originators of the trend are difficult to pinpoint, but most internet users believe the credit belongs to a group 
of Australian teenagers who uploaded the 31-second clip called The 
Harlem Shake v1 (TSCS original) onto YouTube.

So many copies of the Harlem Shake have sprung up individually that it's yet unclear if it has surpassed the billion views obtained by Gangnam Style.
