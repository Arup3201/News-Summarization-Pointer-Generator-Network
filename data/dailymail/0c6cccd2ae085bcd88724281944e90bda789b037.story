A year and a half ago Kerry Maletroit was so ill that she was unable to move or breathe for herself. With just 12 per cent lung capacity, she was in constant, excruciating pain and doctors had warned her she may not survive much longer.

But now the Jersey born 30-year-old is fighting fit, saying she has never felt better and that she enjoys dancing the night away and taking her dog, Disney, for a walk on the beach.

This dramatic turnaround is all thanks to the double lung transplant that Kerry underwent in November 2011.

She is just one of thousands of Britons who have benefited from the 50 per cent increase in organ donation over the past five years, according to new figures released by NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT).

There are currently 7,300 patients on the transplant waiting list and 6,000 of those are waiting for new kidneys.

Nearly every donor can provide at least one kidney and usually they will be able to provide two. Each day three Britons die waiting for an organ.

Kerry suffers with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome, a genetic condition that affects collagen production. It causes tissue, blood vessels and joints in the body to be stretchy and fragile.

For most people, the condition isn't life-threatening, but if teamed with other conditions, symptoms can be more serious.

Kerry suffered with asthma as a child and suffered bouts of pneumonia as a teenager which severely damaged her already fragile lung tissue.

‘The last bout was when I was 18 and I was left very wheezy,’ says Kerry, a former administrator. ‘I found exercise harder than most but I was able to function and with an asthma pump. Life was pretty normal.’

However, over the course of her twenties, Kerry’s health deteriorated rapidly. Doctors regularly tested her lung function and tried to manage her breathlessness but they were unable to stop the steady decline in her ability to breathe.

‘It was terrible – imagine pinching your nose and breathing through a straw,’ says Kerry. ‘That was how life was, day in, day out. It is really terrifying because your body is starved of oxygen and there’s nothing you can do.’

As her body became increasingly weak, she became prone to infection and developed severe and debilitating panic attacks that left her frightened to leave her house.

As Kerry (pictured with husband Philip) became more ill, her weight plummeted to just over five stone

Her skin turned an ashen grey, her weight plummeted to just over five stone and she was eventually fed intravenously in a desperate bid to get her to put on weight so she could grow new lung tissue.

‘I was so weak I had to catch a bus to work even though it was only a 15 minute walk away,’ she says. ‘Eventually it got to the point where I couldn’t even brush my teeth without getting out of breath.’

By age 25, doctors were keen for Kerry to have a transplant, although she was reluctant to have such a major operation, admitting she was in denial about her grave situation:  ‘You never imagine it will be you and, at the time, I couldn’t quite cope with the situation. It was entirely overwhelming.’

In July 2010 Kerry was put on the organ donor list but had to wait a further 16 months until a suitable pair of lungs – one that matched her size and blood type – came up. During this time she became critically ill.

Throughout this period, she hospitalised at the Royal Brompton Hospital in north west London.

Finally she was placed permanently in intensive care because she repeatedly went into full respiratory arrest and could not breathe without the aid of a lung bypass machine.

‘Doctors told my family they were not sure how long I would last so my husband Philip called my family and they flew over from Jersey to spend as much time as possible with me before time ran out,’ she says.

‘But by the end of their visit I went into such a severe respiratory arrest I was sedated and put in an artificial coma.’

Miraculously, during this time a pair of donor lungs that matched Kerry’s criteria came up and a week later Kerry woke up with new lungs.

'My family were so frightened that I might give up the fight that as I slowly came round they kept whispering in my ear “Kerry, you’ve got new lungs. It’s all going to be okay, you’re going to get better!”,’ she remembers. ‘I was very confused because I was on so many drugs but I could hear them.’

Within hours of the transplant at the Harefield Hospital, Kerry’s family were astonished by the visible difference in her health. She was still incredibly weak but they couldn’t help but be shocked by her suddenly rosy cheeks.

‘It took me two days until I could even touch my nose because I was so exhausted, but within three weeks I was taken off a ventilator and able to breathe for myself,’ explains Kerry.

‘I couldn’t believe I’d made it – I was ecstatic.’

Kerry hasn’t met her donor’s family but she knows that her lungs came from a 47-year-old female.

She has written to the family and says that every day is a reminder of how she is indebted to the anonymous woman who took the time to put herself on the register.

‘My lung function is now 90 per cent and I appreciate every single moment, every single thing. I just want to do the woman who helped me proud. I want to make sure I make the most of the extra time I’ve been given.’

Kerry continues to take anti-rejection drugs, steroids and a number of other medications to ensure her new lungs function properly for as long as possible.

She says she is optimistic about the future.

‘I can honestly say I’ve never felt better in my life – I’ve booked a holiday to Australia with my husband and I’ve even applied for a job. Normal life has never felt so good.’

The sharp rise in organ donation is largely due to the creation of a network of specialist nurses who support bereaved families and discuss the possibility of organ donation with them.

Specialist nurses are one of a number of recommendations made in 2008 by the Organ Donation Taskforce, following a decade of almost no increase in the number of donated organs.

The taskforce also pushed for the creation of specialist organ retrieval teams and wider promotion and campaigning around the importance of organ donation.

Giving and taking: The number of organs being donated is at an all time high

These recommendations have led to a sharp increase in organ donors across the UK – a rise of 49 per cent rise in England, of 16 per cent in Wales, of 74 per cent increase in Scotland and an astounding 82 per cent increase in Northern Ireland.

Consequently there has been a 31 per cent boost in the number of people receiving a life-saving or enhancing organ transplant since 2008.

‘This is an outstanding achievement that few thought possible at the time this ambition was set,’ said Bill Fullagar, chairman of NHSBT. ‘It is the result of the hard work and dedication of staff in hospitals and communities across the country.

‘We must also share our heartfelt thanks with every family who, at a great time of sadness, supported their loves one's wish to donate their organs and transform the lives of up to nine other people.’

Despite the increase in organ donors, the numbers of families refusing to grant consent remains among the highest in Europe, and NHSBT is calling for more to be done.

In addition to this, lack of organ donation awareness amongst the black and Asian community particularly needs to targeted, according to the NHSBT.

Despite being three times more likely to need a transplant, only three per cent of this section of the population is on the organ donation register.
