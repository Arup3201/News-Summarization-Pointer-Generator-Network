Martin Keown believes Steven Gerrard is leaving Liverpool too soon, but Jamie Carragher has backed his former team-mate's decision to depart. 

The 34-year-old is set to announce that he will quit Liverpool in the summer when his contract expires, ending a 26-year association with the club.

However Sportsmail columnist Keown believes the former England captain still has much to offer Brendan Rodgers' side.

'I think you keep hold of these great players for as long as possible,' he said on Match of the Day.

'You’ve got to think it’s his decision because they’ll want to keep him, Brendan Rodgers wants that, you need that to integrate the old and the new. You certainly can’t blame Gerrard for where they are in the table this season.'

But Carragher tweeted: 'Sad day for Lfc & English football with the Gerrard news, I think it’s the right decision all things considered.

‘Leaving or retiring is a great confidence booster, this morning my timeline was full of “why's Gerrard starting” now it’s “Gerrard best ever”.

Robbie Savage, meanwhile, praised Gerrard's fine career but also feels the timing is right.

Seems Steven Gerrard is set to leave Liverpool at the end of the season. One of the finest players to have graced the PL. A top, top player.’

TERRY McDERMOTT

‘Mark my words Gerrard is the greatest player to have played for #lfc sad sad day for everyone connected with the club.

‘Kenny and Souey shone in great great LFC teams ... Gerrard has played in LFC teams that were at best mediocre and he carried them to trophies.’

PETER CROUCH

‘I’ve been fortunate to have played with some top players in my time but Stevie g is easily the best I have played with . #gerrard #LFC’

‘I think he’s been Liverpool’s best ever midfield player, the second best players they’ve had behind Kenny Dalglish,' said Savage.

'But probably I think the time is right. I think he’s been a magnificient servant and one of the best Premier League players ever.

'The problem is where do you play Steven Gerrard now. Do you play him number 10? A defensive midfielder? 

I’d play him in a back three, which he is more than capable of because playing Gerrard in the middle of the park at his age you miss Jordan Henderson’s energy.'

It's thought Gerrard will seek a move abroad with MLS side LA Galaxy already expressing an interest in his services. 

He has assured Liverpool that he will not join one of their close rivals.
