It raised more than a few eyebrows when it was first unveiled by Team Sky in January.

But now it seems that the black 'fishnet style' suit showcased by cyclist Chris Froome is attracting attention for all the wrong reasons.

The defending Tour de France champion has released pictures of his red raw back - which has been sunburnt through the lightweight mesh while training in South Africa.

The defending Tour de France champion has released pictures of his red raw back - which has apparently been sunburnt through the lightweight mesh while training

He first 
modelled the skin suit  - that's so close to actual skin you can see his nipples through the fabric - in January.

It features sheer black mesh and there is a modesty-protecting
 black panel in the groin.

'Trying out my new 2014 @TeamSky @rapharacing kit. The skin suit takes #marginalgains to the next level,' he tweeted.

Manufacturers
 Rapha said: 'The design philosophy is ‘robust simplicity': streamlined,
 lightweight, durable and unfailingly fit for purpose.'

But Froome's fiancée Michelle Cound took 
to Twitter to post the picture of her husband-to-be's red raw back, 
along with the words: 'The danger with wearing mesh jerseys... #OUCH'

Marginal gains: Team Sky's search for perfection has seen them win the past two Tour de France titles

But Froome's fiancée Michelle Cound took to Twitter to post the picture of her husband-to-be's red raw back, along with the words: 'The danger with wearing mesh jerseys... #OUCH' 

The Tour de France winner headed a list of 10 riders who have signed new contracts with Team Sky for 2014.

Froome said on teamsky.com: 'This has been an incredible year for me and I'm delighted to finish it off by signing a new contract with Team Sky. I've been with this team since the start and I know this is the right place for me to continue to grow as a rider.

'It's impossible to win races without the right team beside you so I'd like to thank everyone at the team for their continued support. It's an honour to be a Team Sky rider and I hope to play a big part of its success for years to come.'
