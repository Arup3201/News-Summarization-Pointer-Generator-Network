It is a measure of the job facing David Moyes on Sunday night as his Real Sociedad side face Barcelona that he comes up against one of the scourges of his Premier League managerial career in Luis Suarez and yet the former Liverpool striker will not be his biggest concern.

Moyes must also deal with Leo Messi who scored 58 goals for club and country in 2014 and wants to start 2015 in style. Moyes said of the Argentine: 'We will try to stop him but everyone tries to stop him. He is a very special player. We have all been privileged to watch him play over the years.'

Suarez, who will partner Messi and Neymar in attack for Barcelona this evening, clashed with Moyes in the 2012-13 season when the then Everton manager criticised him for diving ahead of a Merseyside derby in which Everton's Phil Neville ended up being booked for simulation.

The match will see Luis Suarez face Moyes for the first time since the two men left England

The Uruguayan striker celebrated Liverpool's first goal in front of the Everton dug-out by diving at Moyes feet and he wrote in his autobiography Crossing the Line published last year: 'David Moyes complained that I was a diver and then his captain, Phil Neville, got a yellow card for diving during the match. 

'Moyes's comment struck me because they were made before the game; you can talk after the game if I have dived against your team but he complained before so I thought: 'You think I dive? I'll show you a dive.'

Suarez also scored against Moyes when Liverpool beat Manchester United 3-0 a month before he lost his job. Speaking ahead of tonight's game the Real Sociedad coach, who has made a steady start at the Basque club, underlined the enormity of the task in hand facing Barça.

Moyes has won two, drawn four and lost one game since taking over as Real Sociedad's manager

He said: 'It's difficult to take the game to them because they have so much of the ball. They have fantastic individual talents who can win the game on their own but for the sustained success that they have had you need more than that. They have been a special team and still are. I am really looking forward to the game. I am looking forward to challenging such a good team.'

With Suarez, Messi and Neymar all recently back from mid-winter breaks in South America and the club still reeling from the refusal of the Court of Arbitration to reduce the FIFA-imposed year-long transfer ban, this may be a good time to play Luis Enrique's side.

Real Sociedad beat Barcelona last season and have already taken the scalps of Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid this campaign. Moyes added: 'The players have shown they can beat Barcelona before so we have to show it again. We have to show them that this is not an easy place to come and win. We have to be tough.'

But, as well as Suarez, Moyes will have to find a way to stop Lionel Messi and Neymar on Sunday
