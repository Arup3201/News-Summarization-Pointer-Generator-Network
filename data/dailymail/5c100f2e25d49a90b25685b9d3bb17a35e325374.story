Eight top English football clubs are being investigated after Rangers Football Club plunged into administration and lifted the lid on an alleged widespread tax dodge.

Fans of the Scottish Premier League giants were furious after it was revealed that the Glasgow club owes up to £70million to the taxman.

Now the nightmare is spreading to the rest of the sport's elite, as current and former Premier League sides are being investigated over deals thought to be worth hundreds of millions of pounds.

Rangers owe around £9m to HM Revenue and Customs plus a potential 
£70m bill to follow an inquiry into its use of 
Employment Benefit Trusts, which are often seen as ways of avoiding tax.

EBTs allowed foreign football stars to have their wages paid into a trust, so they could withdraw the money after they stopped living in Britain and therefore avoid the top 50 per cent rate of UK tax.

One of the reasons Rangers fell into administration is the probe by Her Majesty’s Revenue & Customs into the use of Employee Benefit Trusts - a complex tax avoidance scheme.

The Scottish giants are understood to have used EBTs for the decade leading up to Craig Whyte taking over the club last year.

EBTs were until recently considered an efficient way of reducing tax – but companies with disputed EBT issues had to settle them by December 31 last year.

Companies pay into a trust, which loans the money to the employee for benefits. Examples of these benefits are pensions or the purchase of shares. The money is never meant to be repaid.

EBTs allowed foreign players to have their wages paid into a trust and withdraw the money when they were no longer living in Britain - therefore avoiding the top 50 per cent rate of UK tax.

HMRC claim Rangers’ previous owners used EBTs to avoid paying millions of pounds in tax and National Insurance on the player payroll.

The taxman has declared the practice illegal — and claims the club's previous owners used the trusts to avoid paying millions of pounds in tax and National Insurance on the player payroll.

'Rangers may be the tip of the iceberg,' football finance expert Dr Chris Brady told The Sun.

'EBTs became popular with clubs as a means of reducing crippling wage bills.

'We believe at least eight current or former Premier League clubs are being investigated.'

Rangers boss Ally McCoist summed up the feelings of all the club's fans yesterday, saying: 'It has been a very disappointing and black day.

'We have 140 years of fantastic history, but the most important thing is that we look to the future and the next 140 years.

'Going into administration obviously wasn't ideal, but it's the opinion of many people that it might be the best thing.'

Fans protested outside the Ibrox Stadium today, demanding answers from the club's owner Craig Whyte.

Celtic
 are now four points ahead of Rangers at the top of the Scottish Premier
 League - but the Glasgow club now have more pressing issues.

Paul Clark, of administrators Duff and Phelps, told Rangers TV: 'We will be conducting regular meetings with the staff and, wherever we can, will keep giving messages to the fans who we know have an interest in the work that we are doing.

'I can't give any firm commitment but certainly over the next day or two we hope to get control of the finances of the club and to better understand what we need to do in the coming days and weeks.

'The club had been in such a period of uncertainty that the administration will actually relieve that uncertainty and start to build the future.'

Former Rangers player Trevor Steven has said he believes Whyte's presence at Ibrox will soon be untenable.

Rangers supporters are asking serious questions of Whyte, who bought out Sir David Murray for £1 but pledged to settle Lloyds Banking Group's £18m debt and invest in the playing squad and stadium.

Earlier this month, Whyte admitted he had accessed cash from loan company Ticketus after reports claimed he had borrowed £24m on future season ticket sales.

The main issues over alleged unpaid tax date from before Whyte took over. But Steven still feels his relationship between the fans and Whyte, who flew out of Glasgow Airport last night, cannot be mended.

'I don't think there has ever been a good relationship between Craig Whyte and the support,' he said.

'For me, there has always been smoke and mirrors since he came in. He came with a handful of promises that have never been delivered.

'That's what really aggravates the Rangers support, they have never been able to trust the man in charge and there has been no transparency.

'The fact that he has gone off to Monaco is not particularly what the supporters want to hear.'

Administrators Duff and Phelps have now moved to calm fans' fears that their club will cease to exist.

They
 have also confirmed that Saturday's Clydesdale Bank Premier League game
 against Kilmarnock at Ibrox will go ahead as planned.

A statement said: 'We can report we have made very good progress within the first 24 hours of being appointed administrators over Rangers Football Club.

'Our first priority has been to ensure that the football club continues to function and this is being achieved with the help of staff, players and management at the club.

'In particular, we would like to thank the club's business partners who are going the extra mile to ensure that Saturday’s home match against Kilmarnock goes ahead as scheduled. We had extremely constructive discussions with Strathclyde Police and we can confirm the match will take place.

'We fully recognise this is a difficult time for players and staff at the club and are extremely appreciative of their reaction to the situation. We will be holding meetings with the staff on a weekly basis at least to inform them of developments.

'We are also in the process of speaking to representatives of supporters' groups and that will be an ongoing process.

'In broad terms, supporters can be reassured that Rangers will continue as a football club and we hope to reach a stage as soon as possible where the club can emerge from administration.

'We have had expressions of support across the political spectrum in Scotland within the last 24 hours and there is clearly a desire to see Rangers come through this situation successfully.

'There had been widespread publicity and speculation regarding the financial affairs of the football club.

'For clarity, the cost structure of the club and ongoing losses were such that the club had outstanding liabilities to HMRC.

'These were the subject of discussion and clearly HMRC wished to see them resolved as a matter of urgency.  We are involved in dialogue with HMRC and will work with them constructively, as is the case with all other key stakeholders.'
