A 'wicked' Eastern European couple pretended to Good Samaritans and helped a blind pensioner into a shopping centre before stealing £100 cash from his bag, police said today.

Officers in Hereford are hunting for the criminals after the man, in his 80s, was targeted after he withdrew cash from a bank.

After offering to help the man into Marks & Spencer, the couple stole the money from his bag before fleeing.

Terrible: This is the shocking moment a blind man is targeted by thieves after withdrawing money from his bank in Hereford

CCTV images released from West Mercia Police show the moment the woman, wearing a fur coat and short white skirt, took the elderly man, by the arm.

The victim, who is snapped holding his white stick, is unaware the woman and her accomplice are luring him into a quiet area of the shop where they raid his bag.

The man only discovered what had happened when he checked his bag and realised the money had gone.

The theft took place in broad daylight at 12.45pm on Thursday, September 19 and police say the couple had foreign accents likely to be from Eastern Europe.

'Appalling crime': The woman took the man by the arm, led by her accomplice, right,  into a quiet area of M&S where they raided his bag for £100

Pc Julian Jones is investigating the incident. He said: 'The victim, who is registered blind, walks with the aid of a stick and sadly, it appears this may be the reason he was targeted.

'To take advantage of someone so clearly vulnerable is an absolutely wicked and appalling thing to do.

'We believe he was distracted by the woman's offer of help so that someone could steal the cash from him and we are keen not only to find those responsible, but also to issue a warning to stop others from being victims in the future.

'I would urge people to be on their guard against distraction thieves, especially the vulnerable such as the elderly or disabled, who unfortunately are often the targets of these types of offences.

Anyone who sees them should call 101 and ask for West Mercia Police, quoting reference 303S 190913.
