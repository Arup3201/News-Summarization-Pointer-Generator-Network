A surge in the number of flu cases is threatening to push the NHS ‘over the edge,’ doctors warned last night.

Latest official figures show a four-fold increase in the number of flu cases during December, with GPs, facing an extremely busy post-Christmas week at their surgeries, amid fears that hospitals will become log-jammed if the outbreak continues to gather pace.

Medical experts are worried a resurgence of ‘Hong Kong flu’ – a strain known as H3N2 and blamed for the deaths of more than a million people worldwide in the 1960s – could make the situation worse by putting thousands of sufferers into hospital, with the elderly in particular at risk.

Britain has not had a bad flu winter in four years, as more people have developed resistance to the H1N1 swine flu virus, dominant in recent years. 

However, scientists say ‘nasty’ H3N2 flu has taken its place – with virulent vaccine-resistant strains also in circulation.

Dr David Mant, professor emeritus of general practice at Oxford University, said: ‘There is good reason for anxiety that this will be a bad winter for flu. 

'This will place extra demand on an already over-stretched NHS. Many hospitals are already working at very high bed occupancy rates and emergency departments are experiencing record numbers of attendances.’

At the start of December, there were an estimated 3,500 new flu cases per week, according to data published by Public Health England. 

At the start of December, there were an estimated 3,500 new flu cases per week but by Christmas it had jumped to 13,500 cases 

'But by Christmas that had jumped to 13,500 new cases a week – an almost four-fold increase.

Dr Peter Swinyard, chairman of the Family Doctor Association, said a major flu outbreak would put ‘immense pressure’ on A&E departments and hospitals generally.

Dr Richard Vautrey, a Leeds GP and a senior member of the British Medical Association, added: ‘The system is running hot at the moment and you only need a little bit of extra pressure to push it over the edge.’
