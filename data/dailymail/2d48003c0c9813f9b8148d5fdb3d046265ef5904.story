An 18-year-old college student has been charged with dumping her stillborn baby girl in a trash bin on Thanksgiving.

Police said Lucretia Jordan-Smith admitted she abandoned the infant in an alley behind her apartment building on the 4200 block of Red Bud Avenue in St. Louis, Missouri, on November 28.

The infant's tiny body was found wrapped in two plastic grocery bags and a larger black trash bag on Thanksgiving morning by paramedics, after Jordan-Smith's friend reported the incident to police.

St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported a young woman called police saying her friend had just given birth and dumped the body.

Jordan-Smith was a college student, home for the holidays, when she allegedly gave birth to a girl weighing 3lbs7oz.

The Soldan International Studies High School graduate initially told police she didn't know she was 
pregnant.

The teen has been charged with abandonment of a corpse and could face up to four years in prison if convicted.

The baby’s body was not claimed by Jordan-Smith's family.

St. Louis police detectives arranged to have a funeral for the baby, whom they named Raguel after the angel of justice.

About a dozen police officers and some members of Jordan-Smith's family gathered at a chapel in Calvary Cemetery in January to mourn the loss of little Raguel.

The memorial was organized by Garden of Innocents, a group which provides memorial services and burials for unclaimed children and infants in the St. Louis region.

'Today is not about blame,' Tonya Tanksley, a child abuse detective, told the gathering.

'It’s about compassion and honoring the life of a little person.'

It was Tanksley who came up with the child's name.

'She was a beautiful baby girl. She had a full head of hair and fingernails,' she said.
