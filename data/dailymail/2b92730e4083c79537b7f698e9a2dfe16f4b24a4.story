Ever since he was evicted from his makeshift home inside the Manhattan Bridge, homeless man Joe Zhou has found refuge in a 24-hour McDonald's - but he is not lovin' it.

A dozen officers wearing helmets and brandishing hammers raided Zhou's humble abode Thursday morning and tore apart his coffin-sized hovel, which he had built from flimsy wood.

Officers removed his belongings, including pots, bedsheets, clothing and even electrical items, before dumping them in an overflowing truck.

Displaced: Homeless man Joe Zhou who lived under the Manhattan Bridge was removed and his home between the beams of the bridge was tore apart by the NYPD

Under the Golden Arches: Zhou has been spending his nights in a 24-hour McDonald's eatery

Zhou, 57, was taken to the Bellevue 
Men's Shelter in Midtown Manhattan, but he did not stay there long, 
instead decamping to a 24-hour McDonald's.

Speaking to a New York Post reporter through a Chinese translator, Zhou explained that he is wary of people who might recognize him, and he does not like to stay in shelters.

The Chinese immigrant lamented the loss of his shack, which he had constructed thanks to a set of skills he pick up while working on building projects in New York and Boston.

His tiny nook under the bridge featured a functioning stove, a reading lamp and a pantry stocked with Bud beer cans and Sriracha.

To make ends meet, the 57-year-old has been selling casino vouchers on the black market - a popular trade among the city's homeless and unemployed.

Lingering questions: Zhou had a family and a job in China, but for some unknown reason, he picked up and left 17 years ago, settling in New York

Troubled past: Zhou has run afoul of the law and wound up on the streets because he was unable to afford a rent

According to the Post, the now-notorious vagrant had a wife and children in China, but for reasons unknown he picked up and left 17 years ago, moving to the U.S.

Upon his arrival in New York City, Zhou found odd jobs to support himself, including frying egg rolls at a Chinese restaurant, but he never stayed anywhere for more than a couple of weeks.

Things took a turn for the worse when Zhou ran into some trouble with the law and wound up on the streets.

Unable to afford rent, Zhou erected shanties on the grass near the Manhattan Bridge, but police knocked them down. That is when the 57-year-old decided to seek refuge inside the frame of the span.

Removed: The team pulled down the man's belongings from the shack where he has been living for a year

Evicted: The man living inside the bridge is pictured after police arrived on the scene on Thursday

For
 a year, the man had managed to quietly come and go from his home on the
 cyclists' side of the New York City landmark, which connects Manhattan 
and Brooklyn.

But his hideaway was discovered last month after a
 cyclist called 911 saying he thought the man was trying to commit suicide -
 when he was actually climbing into the safe confines of his tiny home.

The NYPD said that the home had to be demolished because it was dangerous for Zhou and for those who use the cycle path of the bridge.

MailOnline spoke to him at the home earlier this week and, speaking in heavily-accented English, he said that he arrived in New York City from China 13 years ago.

Belongings: They pulled down his belongings and piled them high in trucks to be discarded

Carted away: His items, including bedding and wood, filled a truck near to the Manhattan Bridge

Stash: The team of police officers pulled down his belongings on Thursday, including electrical items

When asked where he had lived in China 
before arriving in the United States, the 57-year-old said that he had 
worked in Shanghai, but had left to try and find a better life in the 
United States.

Claiming to have suffered a financial loss through gambling, Zhou said that for the past year he had called the Manhattan Bridge his home - constructing the base between the girders using wood discarded from nearby Chinatown.

Indeed, dotted around the shack built into the bridge was evidence of his shanty construction - wooden boards and used water bottles litter the area.

Zhou said that there were others who 
lived in or near to the bridge - including one woman who had moved her 
worldly possessions off the cycling ramp to the entrance of of the famous structure finished in 1912.

Supplies: Zhou had a pantry in his shack stocked with beer, Sriracha and salt

Crowd: Members of the NYPD looked on as officers pulled down items on Thursday morning

Surprisingly 
well dressed for a man who lives in a bridge, Mr Zhou said that the brutal 
winter that New York and the nation just experienced was difficult to 
endure.

He also said that he was working on a second 
shack just 15-feet up the ramp from his current abode. Each of the cramped homes were around ten feet-by-one-and-a-half feet and seemed to be protected with bike locks.

The
 tiny, narrow dwellings were just big enough for one person to lie down.
 The living spaces also provided little silence as loud subway trains 
rumbled by on four different tracks, 24 hours a day.

Emerging: The man who lived in the shack said his name was Joey. He is pictured by his home this week

Looking inside: Water bottles and wooden planks litter the area where 'Joey' built his home on the bridge

Daylight: Earlier this week, Zhou explained that he has been coming and going from the home for a year. But a passerby saw him climbing into the home and thought he was committing suicide, so called the cops

Heading home: 'Joey' headed back to his shack to replace his umbrella after it stopped raining

The spot was also poorly lit and well-trafficked with bikers who speed past, not expecting to see a pedestrian on this side of the bridge.

Zhou likely picked the spot because 
it is part of a short expanse of the bike path where there is a roof. 
There is also no roof over the pedestrian walkway.

Last
 Sunday, a cyclist saw the vagrant climbing to his rustic nook and mistook him 
for a jumper, calling 911 to report what he thought was an impending 
suicide.

Before: His home, only accessible by the cyclists' lane, was snapped in daylight before it was pulled down

Secret: His home, seen above the cyclists' lane, was accessed by climbing over the steel railings
