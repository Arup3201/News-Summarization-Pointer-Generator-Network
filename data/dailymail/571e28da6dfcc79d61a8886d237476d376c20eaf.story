A mother who kidnapped her two children and fled to Australia after complaining her husband spent more time playing cricket than he did with her has won the right to take them to live abroad permanently.

The Australian-born dental nurse abducted the couple's children, aged four and five, when her marriage broke down, taking them from their home in East Sussex to Melbourne without telling her British sports masseur husband.

Now a judge at London's High Court has ruled that the children should live in Australia, despite the 'abysmal' and 'cruel' way the 34-year-old woman had treated their father when she disappeared to the other side of the world with his young family.

'Selfish': A judge ruled the children should live in Australia with her mother, despite the 'abysmal' way she had treated their father

In a judgement made public today, Mr Justice Mostyn said in the interests of the children - who cannot be named for legal reasons - he had decided not to punish their mother for her 'high handed, selfish and autocratic' conduct, and to 'shut out his strong feelings of sympathy' for the youngsters' father.

The woman's estranged husband, 33, has agreed to move from East Sussex to Australia - where the judge noted he could still pursue his passion for cricket - following the outcome of the case.

The judge told how the Australian born mother became 'miserable' and complained that her husband, a member of a local cricket club, spent more time with playing sport than he did with her.

There days after her husband asked for a divorce, the woman took the couple's children to her parents home in Melbourne.

The judge told how the couple met in Brisbane in 2001 while they were both on holiday, and renewed their acquaintance when the mother was travelling in the UK. They lived together at the home of the man's parents in the UK for the first half of 2005 before the woman returned to Australia. The man then moved in with her in Australia at the end of 2005 and the pair got married in the country in April 2006.

After returning to Eastbourne in July 2010 the couple moved in with the husband's parents once again, before renting their own flat in the town from January 2011. But in May 2011 the woman 'went home' to Australia without telling her husband. The ensuing legal battle saw the children 'subjected to two years of uncertainty' ahead of the High Court's ruling.

'This was an open and shut case of child abduction,' Mr Justice Mostyn said.

Kidnapped: It was an 'open and shut case of child abduction' when the woman took the children to Australia without telling their father, a judge said

It led to protracted court proceedings in Australia where the mother battled to keep her children in Melbourne while their father fought to have them returned to England.

In July last year the mother dropped her defence and in August after 15 months in Australia the father brought them back to live in England.

She returned to England in December and applied for a relocation order to take them back permanently to live in Australia.

The judge said the decision he had to make 'is exceptionally difficult as the merits each way are evenly balanced'.

He added: 'But in a way the decision I have to make is not as heart-rending as is the case in so many of these relocation disputes.

'This is because the parents have agreed that whatever I decide there will be shared care. I will have to decide in which country the children should live and in the light of that decision the unsuccessful parent will travel to live in that country.

'This is to the very great credit of the parents, who each is prepared to put his or her interests beneath those of the children,' the judge said.

'These children will grow up enjoying the society of each of their parents and will not be confined, like so many children in these relocation disputes, only to occasional direct contact with the non-residential parent.'

The judge said that the father 'accepted that he retained friends in Australia although these had dwindled to few in number'.

He added that the man would be able to continue to pursue his 'principal recreational interest' of cricket in Australia.

In finding in favour of the children returning to Australia the judge said he found the father to be 'honest and fair'.

Ruling: The judge said the father intended to move to Melbourne, in Australia, to be close to his children following the outcome of the case at London's High Court

While the father described his wife's apology as insincere and 'manipulative' the judge said she had eventually shown 'remorse' and apologised for her actions.

'However, it must be possible for the scales to fall from the eyes of someone in the wrong; for her to recognise her wrongdoing; and to seek redemption,' the judge said.

'I judge the mother to have been sincere (up to a point) in her remorse and apology, and at last to have recognised that her behaviour was very poor indeed.'

He added: 'I am therefore prepared to give the mother the benefit of the doubt. I very much hope that the faith that I place in her will not prove false. She should have no doubt that if that faith is breached she will likely lose the shared care of the children.

Mr Justice Mostyn said he regarded the children's father as 'highly competent and self-sufficient'.

He said the children's 'physical, emotional and educational needs are much the same whether they are in Eastbourne or Melbourne'.

The judge continued: 'The decision that I make is based from first to last on the interests of these children. I must shut out my strong feelings for sympathy for the father at the high-handed, selfish and autocratic way he has been treated by the mother, and I must eschew any temptation to punish the mother for that conduct.'

He said the couple had decided to divorce in whichever country they live in, which would now be Australia.

But before leaving the case he said: 'Finally, I would repeat what I have said before. Child abduction seldom, if ever, has a happy ending. It has rightly been described as a form of child abuse.

'The mother's conduct was abysmal. It was an act of deliberate cruelty to her husband, the father of her children. It was directly contrary to the interests of the children for them abruptly to have been removed from the society of their father. 

'It has subjected them to two years of uncertainty while they have been taken across the world, back and forth. It has embroiled all members of the family in extensive litigation with days in court in both countries. 

'It has brought the mother to the brink of bankruptcy. Yet it has not been until very recently that the mother has developed any self-awareness. Her attitude was "I did not abduct them; I just took them home".

'This is an all too common attitude but it is as misguided as it is futile. If the place to which the children are taken is a subscriber to the Hague Convention then the children will almost inevitably be returned with all the delay and heartbreak that this case has demonstrated. Had the mother behaved correctly and made an application for relocation in 2011 then I expect it would likely have been granted, and all that trauma avoided,' the judge said.
