Banned: Teresa McKenzie admitted unacceptable professional conduct at the Teaching Agency misconduct hearing

A deputy head teacher cleared of having sex with a special school pupil has been banned from teaching indefinitely.

Teresa McKenzie, 41, admitted unacceptable professional conduct at the Teaching Agency misconduct hearing while working at a special needs school in Cheshire.

The hearing last month found that the mother-of-two sent more than 600 text messages and two letters to a troubled 16-year-old pupil and wrote letters to him calling him her ‘gorgeous pirate’.

In the communications Ms McKenzie is claimed to have said: ‘I won’t be able to concentrate in the meeting thinking about your beautiful eyes, strawberries and cream hair, soft hands, gorgeous laugh, strong-shoulders, delicious lips.’

She admitted sending them to the pupil between December 2007 and July 2008, calling him her ‘seafaring sweetie’ and saying she would ‘love (him) forever and ever’.

Ms McKenzie, of Meifod, Powys had previously been found not guilty of seven counts of sexual activity with the pupil during a trial at Chester Crown Court in 2010.

The panel at the hearing found that she engaged in inappropriate communications with the pupil and that she failed to maintain professional boundaries with the boy. 

No allegations were made of any sexual relationship between the teacher and pupil during the hearing and the findings did make it clear that she is not alleged to have had any kind of sexual relationship with the boy.

During the 11-day-trial in 2010, Ms McKenzie was cleared of sexually abusing the special needs teenager in her care, claiming her letters had been to ‘make him laugh’, ‘calm him down’ and ‘bring him back from the brink of suicide’.

She also claimed that many of the words in the letters were taken from Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet and were sent to encourage him as part of a school project.

The teaching panel took into account she was of previous good character and felt passionately about teaching. 

It concluded the school had ‘ineffective management’ and she was given roles of key care worker and head of care, for which she had no previous experience, training or qualifications.

Boundaries: Education Secretary Michael Gove welcomed the decision saying she 'failed to observe professional boundaries'

The panel heard Ms McKenzie joined the school as a teacher in late February 2006 before being appointed deputy head teacher.

Recommending
a Prohibition Order, the panel said: ‘Ms McKenzie was in a senior 
position and one of considerable trust in relation to this highly 
vulnerable adolescent, who became dependent on her.

‘In her efforts to support him, she lost her objectivity and this impacted on her professional judgment.

'She mismanaged the situation and by her own admission was out of her depth.’

Giving the decision on behalf of the Secretary of State, Teaching Agency deputy director Alan Meyrick said: ‘Ms McKenzie failed to observe professional boundaries, and in failing to observe those boundaries she abused the position of trust that she held with a vulnerable pupil.

‘Her behaviour also set a poor example to her colleagues and placed others in the school at risk.

‘The language used by Ms McKenzie in her communications with Pupil A was inappropriate and the amount of these communications was excessive.

‘I consider that it is in the public interest to support the recommendation of the panel that Ms McKenzie is prohibited from teaching.’

Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove welcomed the panel’s decision saying: ‘Ms McKenzie failed to observe professional boundaries, and in failing to observe those boundaries she abused the position of trust that she held with a vulnerable pupil.’
