A goodbye to the giraffes, a lingering look at a pregnancy scan and even a meeting with Lionel Richie.

These touching pictures show the final wishes of terminally-ill patients fulfilled thanks to the work of a Dutch hospice.

And most are simple, everyday pleasures - a trip to the zoo, a tour of museum or indulging in a good meal.

The Ambulance Wish Foundation Netherlands, with the help of hundreds of volunteers, professional paramedics and comfortable stretchers, aims to give every patient the attention they deserve and bring a little light to their final days. 

Here are just a few of the wishes they have granted...
