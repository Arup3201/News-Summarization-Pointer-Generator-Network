Gareth Bale completed an extraordinary hat-trick of cup final goals to help earn Real Madrid the crown of World Club Champions ending an incredible year of success for the Welsh international and his team-mates. He also scored in the European Cup and the Spanish Cup finals in 2014.

Bale ran onto an Isco pass six minutes into the second half and fired low under the diving body of San Lorenzo keeper Sebastian Torrico to double Real Madrid’s lead. Sergio Ramos had crashed a header home in the first half from a Toni Kroos corner to put Madrid in front.

It was the same combination that got them to the Club World Cup in the first place. In Lisbon last May Ramos’ injury time header equalised the Champions League final against Atletico Madrid and Bale scored in extra-time to finally put Carlo Ancelotti’s side ahead.

Here they were in Marrakech rounding off what many have called Real Madrid’s best ever year – for the first time in their 112-year history they have won four trophies in a calendar year.

Iker Casillas, playing his 700th competitive game for the club, lifted the trophy. He has now won every major honour in club and international football.

Goal-hero Ramos was voted man of the match but there were many candidates with his central defensive partner Pepe also outstanding and Toni Kroos superb in midfield. It was his corner that Ramos headed in on 37 minutes.

San Lorenzo had taken the physical approach early on with Mario Yepes booked for flattening Bale. The former Tottenham man was also wrestled to the ground from the previous corner. 

San Lorenzo finished up with just four bookings from lenient referee Walter Lopez but their strong-arm tactics were not enough to prevent Madrid picking up their 22nd straight victory.

Karim Benzema’s shirt was ripped at the collar and almost pulled from his torso during the second half as he went for a Bale cross. 

For once both the French striker and Ronaldo failed to find the net but Bale’s second half strike made sure there was no way back for San Lorenzo.

Carlo Ancelotti has now won more trophies in 16 months than Jose Mourinho in three years. English coach Paul Clement was, as ever, by his side, and there were a few special words for the Londoner from club president Florentino Perez as he congratulated each Real Madrid player and coaching-staff member as they received their medals.

Ronaldo appeared to snub Michel Platini as he walked down the line of dignitaries. The Frenchman’s recent comments that he believes a German player should win the Ballon d’Or have evidently not gone down well with Real Madrid’s record-breaking forward.

It remains to be seen if Ronaldo is voted best individual player of 2014 at January’s Ballon d’Or gala but what is no longer in any doubt is that Real Madrid are team of the year. 'It’s incredible, unforgettable' beamed jubilant coach Carlo Ancelotti on the final whistle. 'We are delighted to end the year this way but we have to keep going because we know the season does not end here. We want 2015 to be like 2014.'
