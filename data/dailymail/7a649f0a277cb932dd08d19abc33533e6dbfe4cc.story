A Fisheries Department in Australia is refusing to pay a $188,000 bill for removing a whale carcass from a popular beach because 'whales are mammals, not fish.'

While that is scientifically true, the local council in the City of Stirling, West Australia, insists that because the whale came from the sea, the state's Fisheries Department has to pay for its removal. 

The 17 metre carcass washed ashore on Scarborough Beach on November 3, leaving Stirling City to arrange for special earthmoving equipment to lift the rotting body up and transport it by lorry to a waste facility where it was buried, the ABC reported today.

Over $188,000 was spent by the City of Stirling to clean up a 17 metre whale carcass that washed ashore on Scarborough Beach

Stirling's mayor, Giovanni Italiano, said the equivalent of $188,000 was spent on the equipment hire, waste ground fees, cleaning the beach and paying for labour and security.

'I've asked the Premier of the State and the Minister for Fisheries to arrange for the State government to pick up the bill - but all we've been offered is $8,000 for the waste fees and the cost of the contaminated sand,' said Mr Italiano. 

'The Minister for Fisheries' office said they are not going to foot the bill because it's a mammal, not a fish. They believe it's not in their jurisdiction.' 

Mr Italiano told the ABC that that the State Government should have arranged to tow the dead whale out to sea before it was washed onto the beach. 

The local council in West Australia has claimed that the state's Fisheries Department has to pay the bill

'We're not going to pay this and the ratepayers are not going to pay it. 

'We pay the Government $26.3 million  for fire and emergencies services levies and this was an emergency.' 

He insisted that if another whale carcass was washed onto the beach, his council would not handle the clean-up.

Meanwhile a spokeswoman for the Minister for Fisheries said the Fish Resources Management Act of 1994 'does not envisage the Department of Fisheries managing whales, whether they are alive or dead.' 

However the minister for the Fisheries' office said the carcass was 'not in their jurisdiction ' due to being a mammal, not a fish 

Whales are classified as mammals because, unlike fish, they are warm-blooded and breath air with lungs, taking in oxygen directly when they come to the surface at regular intervals. 

When they surface, they exhale the air they have previously breathed in, puffing it out through 'nostrils' known as blowholes. 

They give birth to live young and suckle the new-born on milk secreted by mammary glands.

In addition, they have hair, or rather bristles, usually on their heads. 

Science has taught us that whales, along with dolphins, seals and walruses left the land some 55 million years ago and went into the water, where they evolved into today's creatures.

It was the same whale that made worldwide news when Australian man Harrison Williams, from Perth, climbed on top of it

‘It was definitely a stupid act but I didn't mean any disrespect to anyone. Mum thinks I'm an idiot, and Dad isn't too proud either,' Mr Williams said 

The whale in question is the same one that Harrison Williams, from Quinns Rocks near Perth, climbed on top of after he jumped off a boat on Saturday afternoon.

He became stranded when sharks started to circle the dead whale. 

‘He [the shark] was too busy chomping on the whale so it wasn't too bad,' he said. 

The extreme sports enthusiast added his parents were not impressed with his brush with the whale.

'I’ve done it, I don’t need to do it again,' he said.

‘It was definitely a stupid act but I didn't mean any disrespect to anyone. Mum thinks I'm an idiot, and Dad isn't too proud either.'
