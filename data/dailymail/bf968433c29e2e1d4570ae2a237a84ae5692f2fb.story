Serious: Ben Monksummers was alarmed when he saw his high-velocity rifles on the baggage carousel

A Team GB rifle shooter accused easyJet of committing a 'serious offence' after they put his £11,000 guns arsenal on a public airport baggage carousel.

Ben Monksummers, 22, of Gillingham, Dorset, who has competed in international rifle contests for Team GB, booked a return flight back to the UK to see his family, with the no frills airline.

But on his return trip to Holland, Mr Monksummers, was shocked to see his high-velocity rifles making their way around the public luggage collection carousel at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam.

'Anyone could have walked out of that building with restricted firearms of a value of £11,000. This is a very serious offence' he said.

And it wasn't the first event in which the budget carrier had left him reeling.

Ben, a diabetic, had already been fined 55 euros (around £44) to take his medication on board the flight to the UK.

The sportsman has since lodged a formal complaint with easyJet over the incidents, which occurred at the end of October.

An easyJet spokesman said: 'We apologise for any inconvenience Mr Monksummers experienced.  

'We have procedures in place to ensure that any firearms baggage goes through specific channels, therefore we are currently investigating why this didn't happen on this occasion.  

'The safety and security of its passengers and crew is easyJet's highest priority.

'We always advise passengers to contact us in advance if they need to carry medication on board the aircraft.

'In these instances our customer service team advises passengers that it is only possible to carry medical equipment or medication in the cabin as additional in-cabin baggage upon presentation of a doctor's certificate stating the necessity of it.' 

Arms and explosives such as handguns, automatic weapons, munitions, fireworks, flares, smoke canisters and crackers, are strictly forbidden on easyJet aircrafts.

But firearms and ammunition for hunting and sporting purposes may be accepted as checked Baggage.

The airline's website says: 'The carriage of firearms is strictly limited. Passengers must produce the original of the valid documentation showing proof of ownership and legal authority for the possession of the firearm(s), photocopies of such documentation will not be accepted. Without such documentation, firearms WILL NOT be carried.'
