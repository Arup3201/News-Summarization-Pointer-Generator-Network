A mother had her spine broken in four places, and was left with six cracked teeth and a hole in her retina after being attacked by her jealous ex-boyfriend because she went on a night out.

Lindsey Pringle, 35, who suffers from osteoporosis meaning she has weak bones, had to spend 12 days in hospital after the savage beating by Curtis Storey, 21, in August last year.

Miss Pringle told how she had broken up with Storey the day before the attack because of his controlling behaviour, but when he saw her in a Newcastle nightclub he ordered her to go home saying he would smash up her flat if she didn’t agree.

Miss Pringle described how she broke up with Storey over his controlling behaviour, but when he saw her on a night out the day afterwards he ordered her to go home and then beat her unconscious

Once the pair were alone he attacked Miss Pringle, who stands only 5ft 2in and weighs just six stone, in her bathroom.

He punched her twice in the face, knocking her unconscious, which caused her to fall backwards into her bath, hitting her back and causing four fractures.

At the time of the assault Storey was already serving a community order for stabbing Miss Pringle in the neck with a key, a later hearing at Newcastle Crown Court was told.

Storey, who has a previous conviction for harassing another partner, was jailed for two and a half years after the attack in August last year 

Lindsey, who has an autistic son, Vincent, 13, said: 'I told him I didn't want to be with him. I parked my car around the corner so he didn't know if I was in or not. 

‘Somebody told him we were in a bar and he said to me “get out or I will drag you out”. ‘He was shouting and screaming in my face saying “who said you could go out”. 

‘I said, “I'm not with you, it's got nothing to do with you”. I went to the toilet so I could use my phone and he burst in and grabbed it off me. He looked at me and said “where is your car?” 

‘When I told him it was at my friend's he smashed me in the side of the face so hard I could feel my eye swell. 

'He smashed me in the side of the face and broke three teeth. He hit me again and broke another three teeth on the other side. I blacked out and I woke up on my back in the bath. 

'He used to say "I'll kill you" all the time but I thought he was going to on that night.

'I was in so much pain but the adrenalin got me up. My face was killing me, my eye was black and he put a hole in my retina. 

'I spat out bits of teeth in the sink. My back was in so much pain but we went down stairs together but he locked the front door. He was shouting he was going to kill me and I ran to the back door.'

She found Storey had locked her in the house and she was forced to escape via the back door to a neighbour’s house, who called the police and took her to hospital.

Lindsey added: ‘He knew I suffered from bad bones yet he still attacked me anyway. 

‘He had put a hole in my retina when he punched me. The doctor said I was never going to get my sight back. I was devastated.’

Miss Pringle, a mother-of-one who suffers from osteoporosis meaning she has weak bones, had to spend weeks in hospital after the attack (left), and six months on still walks with a crutch (right)

When Lindsey first met Storey through a friend she fell for his charm. But six weeks into their relationship he became jealous and possessive.

Lindsey, who had previously been in a 16-year relationship, said: ‘When I first met him he was really nice. He was only the second man I had ever been with. 

Miss Pringle, whose son Vincent, 13, is autistic, only had one relationship before Storey, and says she may now never trust a man again

‘But after about six weeks he started telling me what to do and what to wear. 

‘I wasn't allowed to go to his mother's house without him being there and I wasn't allowed any boys as a friend on Facebook.’ 

Before long Storey started to snap for no reason and would cheat on Lindsey behind her back.

She said: ‘He would accuse me of cheating on him and he would kick off for the slightest thing like if I didn't give him £10. He would snap and lock me in the house. 

‘He would say “I am only doing it because you are so lovely and I don't want to lose you'." 

He once dragged her from the house by her hair, smashed her car window, and during one row bit her on the face and nose. 

Storey even stabbed her in the neck with her car key when she tried to break up with him. Lindsey stayed with him because she was afraid he was going to smash up her house or her car.

After the attack  Storey was arrested, and was yesterday jailed for two and a half years.

Meanwhile, six months on from the attack, Miss Pringle still walks with a crutch, sees black shadows in one eye and is keeping her fingers crossed her back heals correctly. 

She added: 'I loved Curtis and I think he loved me too much but he showed it in the wrong way. 

'I never wanted this to happen or for him to get jail but if I was looking at it from someone else's point of view, he should have got five or six years behind bars.'

Lindsey, who also suffers from Crohn's disease, joint hypermobility syndrome and arthritis, added: 'I have permanent damage to my eye, I have nerve damage in my face and the tops of my gums.

Miss Pringle said she started dating Storey after meeting him through a friend, but he soon became controlling, hitting her, smashing her car window, and once biting her on the face during a fight

'My back is healing but because I have osteoporosis they don't know if my back will fully get better, I just hope it will. I'm still on strong painkillers and walk with one crutch.'

Storey, of Walker, Newcastle, who admitted causing grievous bodily harm on August 24, was also made the subject of a lifelong restraining against Miss Pringle.

The court also heard he has a previous conviction for harassment of another partner.

Lindsey added: 'I don't know if I will ever have another boyfriend again. I want to live my life how I want and not have to explain to someone what I can and can't do.'
