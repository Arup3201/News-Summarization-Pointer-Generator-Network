It prides itself on being ‘the fourth emergency service’ – but the AA had to turn to arch rivals the RAC for a tow after one of its cars broke down.

This AA Driving School car got a puncture during a driving lesson at Bonnyrigg, near Edinburgh, and was left stranded because it did not have a spare wheel.

An appeal for help to the AA’s own breakdown service was rejected for an unknown reason, but the company that leased the Ford Focus to the AA was covered by the RAC and so the RAC’s breakdown staff were called in to tow it to a garage for a tyre change.

Embarrassing: The AA had to sheepishly turn to arch rivals the RAC for a tow after one of its cars broke down

Pete Williams, spokesman for the RAC, said: 'The AA Driving 
School vehicle got a puncture but like so many new cars coming off the 
production line it wasn’t carrying a spare wheel.

'The driving instructor called the AA but for reasons unbeknownst to us they weren’t prepared to go to the rescue of the car.

'It turns out the car was leased to the AA by a company which was covered by the RAC - and so we happily obliged to help out.

'We were able to pick up the car and take it to the nearest Kwikfit to get the tyre fixed.

'I’m sure the decision not to help out their own driving school is one the AA is regretting now.

'On
 a serious note, we have been campaigning for a while now for car 
dealers to make buyers of new cars aware of the trend of not including 
spare wheels.

'The RAC comes to the rescue of a lot of drivers who have been caught out because they haven’t realised their car has no spare.'

The AA made no comment.
