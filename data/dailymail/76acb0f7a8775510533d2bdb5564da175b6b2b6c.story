Alastair Cook has quelled fears that England could be without Matt Prior for tomorrow’s first Test against India at Trent Bridge, saying his wicketkeeper is ‘99% certain’ to take part after recovering well from a thigh niggle.

England had summoned Lancashire’s Jos Buttler – their limited-overs gloveman – to Nottingham for a possible Test debut as cover, but Prior emerged unscathed from Tuesday’s training session, and looks set to take his place in the starting XI.

‘There was a bit of concern yesterday with his thigh,’ said Cook. ‘But he’s done everything that was asked of him today and he looks good.

'Fingers crossed he should be alright. 
We’re 99% certain that he’ll be fine. We’ll have a little check in the 
morning just to make sure.’

Earlier,
 the ECB said on Twitter: "Jos Buttler called into the England squad as 
cover for Matt Prior, who experienced some mild tightness in his right 
thigh yesterday.

"... will continue to be assessed during training before a decision is made about his fitness for the 1st Investec Test."

Predictably, Kevin Pietersen got involved on Twitter, posting: 'I thought Buttler wasn't ready for Test cricket 3 weeks ago...what's changed?' in reference to the Lancashire keeper's exclusion from the squad against Sri Lanka.
