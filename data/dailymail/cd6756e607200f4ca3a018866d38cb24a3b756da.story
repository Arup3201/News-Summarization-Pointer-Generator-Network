An embarrassed Nigel Farage was today forced to disown the whole of his party’s 2010 manifesto, after being hit with a host of bizarre proposals he knew nothing about.

The UK Independence Party promised to improve Britain by painting trains in traditional colours, deploying soldiers on the street and enforcing a dress code for taxi drivers and theatregoers.

Despite standing on the manifesto as a candidate in the 2010 election, Mr Farage insisted it was nothing to do with him and 'none of it stands today'.

Pressure: Mr Farage insisted none of the manifesto still stands and the party was still working on new policies

During a car crash live TV interview, Mr Farage was challenged about a raft of policies which formed the Ukip pitch in 2010.

He had briefly stood aside as leader at the time to concentrate on trying to get elected to the Commons.

The Ukip leader was also given a verbal battering by high-flying 
financial analyst Louise Cooper who shouted ‘shame on you’ for saying 
women in the City should be paid less.

Mr Farage, a usually-confident TV performer, appeared to struggle when asked if Ukip now has any official policies at all.

Some of the more eye-catching policies in Ukip's 2010 manifesto include:

It included plans for a flat tax 
regardless of income, and their much-criticised economic plans which 
include cutting taxes by £90billion but increasing spending by 
£30billion.

Mr Farage claimed the latter was not ‘nonsense’ although conceded it was ‘ambitious’.

His party are also apparently reviewing their plans to restrict the number of foreigners on British football teams, which it believes is behind their ‘lack of success’; banning the burqa, axing the Ministry of Defence, imposing ‘proper dress’ in theatres, hotels and restaurants, and investigating alleged discrimination against white people at the BBC.

He told BBC2’s Daily Politics that he did not defend the 2010 manifesto saying he did not put it together. He has been party leader since 2006 but stepped for a while in September 2009 to run - unsuccessfully - for a seat in Buckingham at the 2010 election.

However he said all policies were under review pending the party’s new manifesto for 2015, to be published after the European elections in May.

He claimed it would be ‘similar in flavour’, but the only policies he would commit to yesterday were bringing back grammar schools and leaving the EU.

Mr Farage floundered as he was asked about the party’s proposal to scrap Trident, saying he was not sure the suggestion had come from.

When told it was on the Ukip website, he said: ‘When it comes to websites, I’m not the expert.’ He also claimed not to know about a compulsory dress code for taxi drivers and proposal to repaint trains.

‘Look, under the last leadership and in the 2010 election we managed to present a manifesto that was 486 pages long’, he said.

‘So you can quote me all sorts of bits of it that I will not know. That’s why I’ve said none of it stands today and we will launch it all after the European elections.’

The faltering performance came after the 
Ukip leader, who worked in a brokerage firm before entering politics, 
caused outrage this week by saying women who have children are less 
valuable to their employers when they return to work.

He claimed the City was no longer sexist 
as in the past, but said women who leave their client base to take ‘two 
or three years off’ to have a baby, put themselves at a disadvantage.

Mr Farage was appearing on BBC 2's Daily Politics determined to talk about topics other than Europe and immigration

Today he was confronted by Miss Cooper, a markets analyst at City brokers BGC partners and former equities broker at Goldman Sachs, who said that Mr Farage’s argument was ‘laughable’ and he was ‘talking out of his bottom’.

She said: ‘For all the working mothers
 out there who are battling day-to-day in the City, and elsewhere, who 
are discriminated against, who are paid less than their male colleagues,
 who are looked over for promotion, I say on behalf of them ‘shame on 
you’.

‘And I say double 
shame on you because you have daughters. What kind of example are you 
setting to your daughters by saying what you said? What you are saying 
us laughable. You are talking out of your bottom.’Miss Cooper became known as the face of 
the financial crisis for her TV analysis of the European economic 
downturn in 2011. She accused Mr Farage of factual inaccuracy as women 
can only take a maximum of 12 months maternity leave, not three years. 
She took four months off when she had her child.

Financial analyst Louise Cooper took Mr Farage to task for saying women who take time off to have children are 'worth less' to big City firms

The Ukip leader claimed when he worked in finanace he never took more than a week’s holiday because he could not leave his clients.

He said employees in that field had to be ‘more hardnosed’ than in other careers and few women were able to cope with ‘a family and a big job’ of that sort.

But Miss Cooper hit back saying that many City firms poach employees from their rivals and are prepared to wait up to 18 months for them to start after they finish ‘gardening leave’. This is standard in City jobs so employees do not use inside knowledge they have gained to their advantage.
