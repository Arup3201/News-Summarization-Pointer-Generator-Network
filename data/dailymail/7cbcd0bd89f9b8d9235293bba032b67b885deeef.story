All migrants will have to  demonstrate a ‘reasonable standard of English’ or be barred from claiming benefits, says Iain Duncan Smith.

The Work and Pensions Secretary  announced that tests applied to those who end up claiming any work-related welfare payments will be tightened.

For the first time, migrants are to be quizzed about their language skills to determine whether these are likely  to prove a barrier to them finding employment.

In order to pass the more rigorous test, they will have to answer up to 100 new individually-tailored questions, and submit more evidence before they will be allowed to make a claim.

The Department for Work and Pensions said that, for the first time, migrants will be quizzed about what efforts they have made to find work before coming to the UK and whether their English language abilities are likely to affect their chances of employment.

Migrants are entitled to benefits only if they can prove that they are legally allowed to be here and have sufficient ties to this country to show they are ‘habitually resident’.

Mr Duncan Smith said a more robust system was being introduced in job centres across England, Scotland and Wales this week – and vowed to fight attempts by Brussels to overturn elements of the UK’s existing controls.

‘It is only right that we expect migrants to have a reasonable standard of English if they are to get and keep a job, and participate fully in British society,’ he told the Daily Mail.

‘It is absolutely right that we have strict rules in place to  protect the British benefits system from abuse.

‘That’s why we strengthened the habitual residence test [of eligibility to benefits].

The European Commission don’t like it – and even want to take us to court over the test. I am determined to fight that court action, believing that the test is not only legal, but vital.

‘While language skills form only one element of the habitual residence test, I believe they are a crucial indicator of migrants’ commitment to playing a full role in contributing to this country.

‘The British public are rightly concerned that migrants should contribute to this country, and not be drawn here by the attractiveness of our benefits system. We are taking action to ensure that that is the case.’

The latest figures show more than 5.6million people are claiming working-age benefits.

Of these, 397,000 – or 7 per cent – are thought to have been non-UK nationals when they first registered for a national insurance number.

This is an increase of more than 100,000 since 2008.

Under the tightened system, migrants must provide more comprehensive evidence at the point of making a claim.

This might include what measures they have taken to establish themselves in the UK, their housing and family situation, or what ties they still have abroad.

They will also have to provide more evidence that they are doing everything they can to find a job, said Mr Duncan Smith.
