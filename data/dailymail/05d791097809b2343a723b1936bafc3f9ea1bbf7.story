Just days after leaked images suggested Apple’s iPhone 6 will have a protruding camera, a patent has been issued giving an insight into what this feature may be used for.

The patent, initially filed in 2012, describes a bayonet mount system for an iPhone camera.

The system is similar to that currently used on SLR cameras and lets photographers attach and remove interchangeable lenses using a twist and lock motion.

Apple filed for the patent in 2012, and it was issued yesterday. It describes a bayonet mount system for an iPhone camera, patent image pictured. The system is similar to that currently used on SLR cameras and lets photographers attach and remove interchangeable lenses easily

The bayonet mount system is currently used on SLR 
cameras, for example, and lets photographers attach and remove 
interchangeable lenses using a twist and lock motion.

The bayonet connector system is the standard light bulb fitting in the United Kingdom, Australia, India and other countries.

One side of the mount features radial pins that lock into a L-shaped slot on the other side (pictured above).

Apple said the system is preferable to screw mounts because it is more discreet, and is more secure than magnetic connectors.

Bayonet connectors are also the standard light bulb fitting in the United Kingdom, Australia, India and other countries.

According to the Apple patent: 'it may be desirable to couple a lens to a portable electronic device including a camera.

‘The camera may not include optical zoom functionality, wide angle capability, or certain filters, and hence the addition of an accessory device may be desirable.'

It continued that current lens accessory devices and attachment options for phones have been ‘unsatisfactory’, such as screw mount systems.

Apple said screw mount systems can be bulky and increase in the size of the phone, and this may be ‘undesirable to a consumer.’

The
 patent also explained a magnetic connection may be another option,
 but didn't feel this was secure enough when walking or holding the device.

‘Additionally,
 if the magnetic ring is improperly aligned with respect to the camera, 
the view through the lens may be obstructed or distorted,’ said the 
patent.

Apple’s solution is a bayonet attachment that is functional, but takes up the least amount of space on the device.

Images posted to Chinese social network Weibo earlier this week appear to show a rounded design and a protruding camera for the iPhone 6, pictured left, similar to those seen on the iPod touch. This protruding camera could be used to house the bayonet connector, pictured right, for its proposed interchangeable lenses

The protruding camera and rounded edges of the purported iPhone 6 prototypes are similar to those seen on the current iPod touch model, pictured. But this feature was purely design-led and wasn't used to add lenses

The bayonet mount, pictured, would be built onto the iPhone's rear-facing camera and would protrude marginally above the case

The mount would be built-in to the iPhone’s rear-facing camera bezel, which would protrude marginally above the case.

Various lenses with bayonet-style connectors would then be attached and locked into place.

To prevent damage to the lens, if the phone is dropped for example, Apple continued that the mount could be fixed on a ‘ramped surface’.

This would allow the lens to detach from the device without twisting, if the lens is hit from a certain angle.

Images posted to Chinese social network Weibo earlier this week purporting to show the next Apple device are thought to have been leaked by an anonymous insider working at Apple supplier Foxconn.

Although
 the images are blurry, they appear to show a rounded design and a 
protruding camera, similar to those seen on the iPod touch.

Current iPhone models feature cameras that sit flush the with rear casing.

Alternatively, the models shown in the pictures could be the next generation of Apple's MP3 player.

There are already detachable lenses that work with iPhone devices, such as the Olloclip.

This attachment comes with four lenses that create a range of photo effects including fisheye and wide-angle, plus 10x and 15x macro zoom.

Each lens can be used interchangeably, simply by screwing them on and off, and the whole system costs £69.99.

It would mean interchangeable lenses could be added to Apple devices

Bayonet mounts are smaller and more conspicuous than screw mounts

They are also more secure than magnetic connectors, for example
