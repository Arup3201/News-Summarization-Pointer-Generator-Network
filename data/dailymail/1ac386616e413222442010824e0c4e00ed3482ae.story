A banner mocking Manchester United's poor start to the season was flown over their arch rival's stadium to rub salt in the wounds on a difficult day for Louis van Gaal's men.   

Cheeky Manchester City fans ran a plane over the Etihad Stadium before their clash with title rivals Chelsea with the simple message: 'United we fall - in cinemas soon.' 

It came after the Red Devils had lost 5-3 to newly-promoted Leicester and bore remarkable similarities to a stunt organised by Man United fans last season to express their displeasure with ex-boss David Moyes.

The banner rubbed salt in Man United's wounds on a punishing day for the Red Devils 

The banner bore remarkable similarities to this one flown over Old Trafford by Man United fans last season 

Fans paid to have a banner flown over Old Trafford before the club's clash with Aston Villa on March 29 - and Moyes was sacked less than a month later. 

It said: 'Wrong one - Moyes out' in reference to 'the Chosen One' banner which adorned Old Trafford after the legendary Sir Alex Ferguson handpicked the former Everton boss as his successor.

One the pitch Frank Lampard's goal earned Man City a point against Chelsea 

Man United have taken only five points from their first five Premier League games under Van Gaal, their worst start to a season in Premier League history.

The Scottish manager managed two more points in his first five league games last term.
