Our pillar-box red, open-top Chevrolet would fail its MoT abysmally. The suspension has gone; only the driver's door opens from the inside and there doesn't even seem to be a speedometer.

But it's still going and it's a lot of fun. A bit like Cuba, in fact.

Everyone says you have to go now before the chicken nugget invasion changes everything following President Obama's decision to lift sanctions after 55 years.

A place with a past and a future: Havana is an evocative city, rich in Spanish colonial architecture

For sure, change is needed in a country where almost everyone is denied access to the internet, where most people take home around $20 a month, where there is still rationing and where not believing in the 'Triumph of the revolution' still makes you an enemy of the state.

But turning round this old tanker is going to take decades, not years.

The real reason to go now is because for all their travails, the Cuban people are remarkably kind, honest and polite - and Havana is like nowhere else on Earth.

Everywhere we go, there is a healthy scepticism about the Castro years and what might happen if outsiders are ever allowed to buy land and property.

We're in the open-top Chevy (not driving it) on the way to Ernest Hemingway's house, 20 minutes from Havana.

We've already downed a daiquiri at Floridita, where a statue of the great man occupies the end of the bar, and we've chased that up with a mojito at La Bodeguita del Medio, another of his hang-outs near the sublime Cathedral Square.

Before the day is done, we'll sink more at La Terraza in the fishing village of Cojimar, the inspiration for The Old Man And The Sea, which helped Hemingway win the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1954.

At the wheel: Despite various mechanical troubles, Mark managed to take to the road in Cuba

He bought Finca Vigia in 1940 and lived there off and on for 20 years. It's pretty much how he left it.

Bullfighting scenes and stuffed animals hang from the walls, his typewriter sits on the desk and rum competes for space with his books.

Ask to see Ada and take along a translator. She has looked after the house for more than 20 years. 

When I ask her what Hemingway would make of Cuba today, her eyes fill with tears. 'I don't know,' she says, 'but Hemingway loved Cuba.' 

Back in Havana, our guide takes us to the Museum Of The Revolution, where Fidel, naturally, is the star of the show - but George W. Bush has a walk-on part in the rogue's gallery with the caption: 'Thank you cretin for helping us make socialism irrevocable.' 

Full of character: Trinidad is a touristy - but charming - colonial town  three hours south-east of Havana

What knocks us back is the beauty of the dilapidated grand houses, palaces and squares. It makes you wonder why on earth the British gave Cuba back to Spain in 1763 in return for Florida. Miami or Havana?

No contest.

A joke that still does the rounds is that the revolution failed on three fronts: breakfast, lunch and dinner. And it's no laughing matter. There's only so much dry fish with black beans on the side that a man in Havana can take.

Our best dinner is at Mama Ines, where Fidel's ex-chef has opened his own restaurant. He's an engaging fellow and the walls are hung with black-and-white photos of him and his former boss.

You absolutely have to eat at La Guarida, housed on the third floor of a glorious, crumbling building. 

The food is as dull as anywhere else, but the experience is exquisite: antique wine glasses, nicotine-stained walls, little balconies with room for one table each.

There's music everywhere in Havana, of course.

What takes us by surprise is the art. We have a tour of two studios where Fidel is caricatured as a false Jesus Christ and a sex maniac.

Clutter and colour: Cuba's half-century on a limb has preserved Havana in a dilapidated but beautiful state  

There aren't many decent hotels in the capital.

We pick the pricey Saratoga opposite the vast Capitolio building (a metre higher than Capitol Hill, of which it is a near-perfect replica) because it has a pool on the roof.

On the way to Trinidad, a colonial town three to four hours away, we call in at the Bay of Pigs and watch a 20-minute propaganda film about the failed U.S. invasion, then spend a couple of hours in Cienfuegos, which, frankly, leaves us cold, despite the 30 degree temperatures.

Trinidad is charming, but touristy. Two nights here (we stay at the excellent Iberostar Grand) are ample. It was once prosperous thanks to sugar mills.

Today, its cobbled streets house restaurants and gift shops. Two courses and a bottle of drinkable wine can be had for £20 a head.

One of Cuba's best beaches, Playa Ancon, is eight miles away. We hire bikes and pedal off into the sunset, then persuade a local to bring us back in his rusting banger, bikes in the boot.

Hitting the right notes: You can find  - as Mark did - music and art in many corners of Cuba 

On the way back to Havana we stop briefly in Santa Clara, where the remains of Che Guevara, the poster boy of the revolution, are housed in a grand memorial building. 

We don't linger. We've done our bit with respect to Cuba's past and return to Havana, where the future is on everyone's lips.

Our last night is in a private apartment on the top floor of a building in the residential Vedado district. After dinner, there's just time to take a horse and cart back to the old town, now a World Heritage site.

What is going to happen to Cuba? No one knows. Life, hopefully, will be better for long-suffering Cubans, but it might not be quite such a potent cocktail for the rest of us.
