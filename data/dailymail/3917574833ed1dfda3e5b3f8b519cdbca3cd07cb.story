A Korean woman has had her face re-modelled to look like her idol, Miranda Kerr.

Plastic surgery fan Hong Yuh Reum says it's done wonders for her career as an international model.

She featured on a Japanese TV special about plastic surgery where she said Kerr was her inspiration for undergoing the procedures.

South Korean model Hong Yuh Reum hit the jackpot in her quest to look like Australian model Miranda Kerr

On the show, called Alien Virus, she said: 'It really struck me when I first saw [Kerr] in a magazine. She has a baby face but she's very sexy. I knew I wanted to be like her!'

The show focussed primarily on the dangers of cosmetic surgery, up to and including death from surgical complications.

But Reum had nothing but praise for surgery, attributing going under the knife to much of her career success, report RocketNews24.

The model from South Korea has had multiple cosmetic surgery procedures to look like her idol, including operations on her surgery on her eyes and nose.

Before her surgeries people would tell her mother she looked like an 'adorable non-Korean child'

She also wears blue contact lenses and dyes her hair a honey-brown shade, as well as wearing contouring makeup to make her look more like the Australian model, and copying her style.

A Kerr superfan, she also covers her bedroom walls with pictures of the Australian star, according to femalemag.com.

Hong said that even before her surgeries, people would tell her mother she looked like an 'adorable non-Korean child'

She said: 'I didn't do my forehead. I only did my eyes and nose. Besides that, I haven't touched anything. I didn't put anything in my cheeks and it's all fat.'

'When I said I wanted to get surgery, everyone around me tried to dissuade me. In fact, people often asked if I had surgery even before I got it. I wanted to look like Miranda Kerr so I decided and went ahead with surgery.'

Hong expressed her disappointment that the former Victoria's Secret Angel isn't more popular in South Korea and claimed she was imitating Kerr to help promote her on the Korean Peninsula.

Miranda visited Seoul last June and has appeared in a sketch for SNL Korea.

The popular KoreAm Journal says Kerr is 'a perfect combination of cute and sexy,' and embodies a 'look many East Asian young women wish to achieve.'
