Raymond Morris was convicted of the 1967 murder of seven-year-old Christine Darby and was the prime suspect in the deaths of two other girls

A prison watchdog has complained why a paedophile killer was chained to a hospital bed before his death - despite no complaints being made. 

Raymond Morris - dubbed the Monster of Cannock Chase - spent 45 years in prison until his death in March.

Morris was convicted of the 1967 murder of Christine Darby, seven, and was the prime suspect in the 1965 murders of Diane Tift, five, and six-year-old Margaret Reynolds.

Prison watchdog Nigel Newcomen launched an investigation into Morris's death as he died in custody. 

He expressed concern over the use of restraints while Morris was receiving medical treatment.   

In 2011, Morris began receiving treatment for leukaemia and kidney failure. When removed from his cell at HMP Preston, the killer was handcuffed and escorted by a pair of prison officers.

Morris, 84, was being treated for leukaemia at HMP Preston in Lancashire after being diagnosed with the condition three years ago.

On March 1, 2014 Morris signed a disclaimer refusing active medical treatment and on March 10, he was transferred to the prison's medical unit. He died the following day.

Morris was jailed in February 1969 for the seven-year-old's rape and murder. The bodies of all three girls were discovered within a few miles of each other beside the A34 on Cannock Chase. 

The Prisons and Probation Ombudsman Nigel Newcomen launched an investigation into Morris's death. 

According to the report, as well as having chronic myeloid leukaemia he was suffering for kidney failure and required regular dialysis. 

Morris had earlier signed a document asking medical staff not to resuscitate him in the event of cardiac or respiratory failure.  

Describing Morris's final few hours, Mr Newcomen said: 'Later, the man's breathing was shallow and his pulse weak. His eyes were closed and he shook his head when asked if he was in pain. At 4.45pm, he became unresponsive, but did not appear to be in pain or agitated. 

'At 7.15pm, he became agitated and he was given a sedative. He died peacefully at 7.40pm.'

Mr Newcomnen noted that throughout his medical treatment in 2013 and 2014, Morris was handcuffed, placed in chains and accompanied by a pair of prison officers each time he left his cell.

Mr Newcomen added: 'The clinical reviewer concludes that the overall standard of clinical care the man received was equal to that he could have expected in the community.

'While there were some examples of good practice in the support provided at both prisons, there were no formal care places at Wymott. I am also concerned that he appears to have been restrained for hospital visits, including while undergoing dialysis, despite being elderly, frail and in very poor health.

'This is a matter I have raised with the prison before and the Governor needs to ensure that staff fully understand their legal obligation in relation to the use of restraints for seriously ill prisoners undergoing life-saving treatment.'

The report reveals that Morris made a final bid for freedom in June 2012 when he instructed a solicitor to make an application for release on compassionate grounds, however the papers were never filed.

The headline in an earlier version of this article implied that the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman investigated the prisoner's death because he was handcuffed when he was treated for cancer. We are happy to clarify that the PPO investigates all deaths in custody, whatever the circumstances.
