Cristiano Ronaldo gave a thumbs up with his son in an Instagram selfie after breaking yet another record in his glittering career.

The Portugal superstar scored the only goal in a 1-0 Euro 2016 qualifying victory over Armenia on Friday and, in doing so, became the leading scorer in European Championship history.

Ronaldo's striker at the Estadio Algarve on Friday was his 23rd in the competition (finals and qualifying) and took him past Dane Jon Dahl Tomasson.
