David Moyes was booed by Everton fans on his return to Goodison Park for the first time as Manchester United manager - then saw his side comfortably beaten.

He endured a miserable day as the home side won 2-0 thanks to a Leighton Baines penalty and a goal by Kevin Mirallas before half-time and there were gleeful chants of, 'You're getting sacked in the morning' from the Everton supporters.

Moyes afterwards called his centre half Phil Jones 'stupid' after the defender gave away the penalty for handball in the first half but also bizarrely claimed that his side controlled the game.

The United manager told Sky Sports: ‘We gave away two terrible goals. But we passed brilliantly and kept control of the game, but we couldn’t create enough chances.

‘It was a stupid decision to dive in front of the ball [Everton penalty] and they were two stupid goals to concede on the break.

‘We played very well first half, we passed really well. It was disappointment how we played in the final third though.

‘I couldn’t fault how we played, we kept the ball incredibly well.'

United will not feature in the Champions League next season and may not even make the Europa League after another debilitating defeat.

Moyes added: ‘It does hurt, we want to be in Champions League and we must get back into it as quickly as we can. We are building behind the scenes now and are looking to return.’

Moyes spent 11 years in charge at 
Everton and his reign was largely thought to be a success, although that
 opinion seems to have been partly revised owing to their superb season 
under his successor Roberto Martinez.

The Scot also got on the wrong side of 
the Toffees when he bid for Leighton Baines in the summer and, 
eventually, bought Marouane Fellaini, and that may have prompted the 
fans' abuse outisde the ground and as he walked out of the tunnel.

Chairman Bill Kenwright - a stauch 
ally of Moyes's during his time in charge at Goodison - has made no 
comment, while Martinez dedicates just a paragraph to his predecessor.

However,
 Everton club captain Phil Jagielka wrote in his programme column before the match: 
'Today was never going to be an ordinary game between us. The return to 
Goodison of our former boss and some of his staff undoubtedly adds to 
the occasion.

'David Moyes 
brought me to Everton and I'll always be grateful to him for that. In my
 opinion, he did a fantastic job at this club and nobody begrudged him 
the move to United.

'It will
 be nice to see him again today and of course it will be good to see 
Steve Round, Jimmy Lumsden, Chris Woods, Phil Neville, not to mention 
Marouane Fellaini!

'All we are focusing on as players is the three points.'

Martinez admitted that he was grateful to Moyes for the job he had done before him at Everton but also felt for the fans who gave the Scot a less than welcome reception.

'Now, obviously, he is the Manchester United manager and there is a big rivalry fighting for the same aims as Everton so you can expect that it is going to be a very much competitive atmosphere here,' he said.

'But everyone knows the job that David Moyes did at Everton will never be forgotten and clearly I will have a lot to thank him (for).'

The Spaniard was happy with the workrate of his players as they overcame a United side that had far more possession.

'We knew that we were facing a very good side,' he added. 'Away from home they have a terrific record and in that respect we had three games in eight days and it was important that we were focused and we were very clear in what we wanted to do and I think we did that.

'We controlled the aspects of the game that we wanted to do.

'I thought we were electrifying on the counter attack and I thought the way that we got in the final third was very enjoyable from that respect and then we worked extremely hard to keep a clean sheet.'
