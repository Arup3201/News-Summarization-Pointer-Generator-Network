A woman who claims she was raped by a Marine at the Capitol Hill barracks has waived her anonymity to speak out about her ordeal.

Karalen Morthole, 23, said she thought she would be 'safe' among the marines during a party at the base following an Independence Day baseball game in Washington DC.

She told NBC News: 'In my head, I thought these are people who are supposed to be protecting me.'

Ms Morthole, a bartender who recently graduated from the capital's Catholic University, told the channel how she was socialising with friends at the Ugly Mug bar across the street from the barracks.

A marine invited her to a party at a pub on the base, where she entered in the early hours of July 5 without needing to show I.D.

Ms Molthole told NBC that the group drank 'a lot' of Irish whiskey shots and another marine became sexually aggressive.

She says he pinned her against a wall, got close to her face and repeatedly told her: 'I'm going to [blank] you.'

'I was very scared,' she said. 'I can just remember being in excruciating pain and crying and asking him to stop.'

Ms Molthole claims the alleged attacker, Master Sgt Ronald Bohlayer, tried to force her into a cab with him after he raped her, but she refused.

'He got within six inches of my face and started 
screaming obscenities at me, which prompted the guard I was standing 
next to to hold up his arm and say, "Stand down",' she said.

Ms Molthole said she visited hospital a week after the attack and reported the alleged assault to police a week later.

This week, a Marine Corps general ordered that Bohlayer should be charged with rape, indecent exposure and disorderly conduct reports NBC News.

Bohlayer denies the charges.

Previously, a local prosecutor ruled that Bohlayer would not be charged because the evidence amounted to 'he said, she said', following her testimony to a grand jury.

A previous Marines investigator said the allegations were 'baseless' and should be dismissed, but recommended bringing lesser charges against Bohlayer.

The marine's lawyer, Major Joseph Grimm, claims the new charge is politically influenced by publicity around sexual assaults in the US military.

The charge sheet against Bohlayer alleges that Ms 
Morthole was 'incapable of
consenting . . . due to impairment by alcohol, and that her impairment 
was known or reasonably should have been known by the accused.'

The 22-year-old marine served in Iraq and was awarded the Bronze Star for his 2010 tour of duty in Afghanistan, his lawyer said.

A Marine Corps spokesman would not 
comment on the Bohlayer case, including the accusation from Major Grimm 
that the case was being influenced by politics.

Eugene Fidell, who teaches military law at Yale Law School, said it was rare for a senior authority to order charges to be brought when an investigator had recommended they be dismissed.

He told NBC the Marine Corps general who ordered Bohlayer be charged, Major General Kessler, was navigating a 'minefield' in the wake of the case of James Wilkinson, whose conviction for sexual assault was overturned by an Air Force general.

This drew fire from members of Congress who said top military officials should not be allowed to make decisions in sexual assault cases.

Mr Fidell said the Major General faced accusations of being unwilling to 'make the difficult decision' to send Bohlayer to trial if he had not ordered the court martial.

The military law expert said Ms 
Morthole's acknowledgement that she and her friends had been drinking 
could help the prosecution to show she was unable to defend herself or 
call for help.

The issues surrounding sexual assault within the military are being examined by the Senate Armed Services Committee, which has been considering seven bills.

The measures include one requiring a mandatory minimum sentence of two years in prison for a member of the armed services convicted of rape or sexual assault in a military court.

Both the House and Senate appear determined to shake up the military's culture in ways that would ensure victims that if they report a crime, their allegations won't be discounted and their careers won't be jeopardized. 

The committee last week approved provisions in the defense bill that included stripping military commanders of the power to overturn convictions in rape and sexual assault cases.

The panel also voted to require that anyone found guilty of a sex-related crime receive a punishment that includes, at a minimum, a dismissal from military service or a dishonorable discharge.

Officers, commissioned warrant officers, cadets and midshipmen convicted of rape, sexual assault, forcible sodomy or attempts to commit those offenses would be dismissed under a mandatory minimum sentence.

Enlisted personnel and noncommissioned warrant officers convicted of similar crimes would be dishonorably discharged.

In one hearing, Senator John McCain told the committee he could not advise women to join the military amid the widespread reports of sexual assaults within the armed forces.

He also questioned what the impact of the crimes would be on both male and female recruits if the military did not tackle the problem.

Senator McCain said: 'At its core, this is an issue about defending basic human rights but it's also a long-term threat to the strength of our military.

'We have to ask ourselves: if left uncorrected, what impact will this problem have on recruitment and retention of qualified men and women?

''I cannot overstate my disgust and disappointment over continued reports of sexual misconduct in our military. We’ve been talking about this issue for years and talk is insufficient.'

The Pentagon estimated recently that as many as 26,000 military members may have been sexually assaulted last year, up from an estimated 19,000 assaults in 2011, based on an anonymous survey of military personnel.

While the number of sexual assaults that members of the military actually reported rose 6 percent to 3,374 in 2012, thousands of victims were still unwilling to come forward despite new oversight and assistance programs aimed at curbing the crimes, the report said.

There were nearly 800 reports of sexual assault cases in the Air Force last year, ranging from inappropriate touching to rape.

That is a nearly 30 per cent increase from 2011, when 614 cases were reported.

Many of those cases stem from a single base near San Antonio where dozens of young female recruits and airmen were victimized by their instructors. 

An inquiry into Lackland Air Force Base found that 32 military training instructors allegedly engaged in inappropriate or coercive sexual relationships with 59 recruits and airmen at Lackland, according to the Air Force. 

Six instructors have been convicted in courts-martial on charges ranging from adultery, rape and conducting unprofessional relationships. Nine more instructors are awaiting courts-martial.

Two more received nonjudicial punishments. Fifteen 15 instructors remain under investigation.
