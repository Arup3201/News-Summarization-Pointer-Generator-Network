Jailed: Ariel Castro has been charged with four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape

In the suicide note purportedly written by Cleveland kidnapping suspect Ariel Castro, he claims that he was abused as a child and raped by an uncle, it was revealed today.

According to a law enforcement source, the letter contained details about his whole life and the three abductions - detailing what led him to kidnap the three women off the street and hold them captive for ten years,

The FBI found the note when they were searching Castro's house and said they were fairly certain from its contents that it was a suicide letter.

He detailed that he wanted all his money to be left to his victims Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight.

Castro's home on Seymour Avenue is now a crime scene, with investigators carrying out numerous pieces of evidence - including ropes and chains.

19 Action News reporter Scott Taylor says he received a copy of the letter, which he claims was written in 2004 and found by police inside Castro's house.

Taylor posted excerpts of the letter on his Twitter page late Wednesday night, including a confession that he was 'a sexual predator' and 'I need help.'

In one, Taylor says that Castro didn't know why he kept looking for another victim, because 'I already had 2 in my possession.'Â 

Investigation: The letter, allegedly written by Castro in 2004, is believed to be one of the items collected from his home in the days after the women were freed

In another, Castro allegedly wrote that he was surprised how young his daughter's best friend Gina DeJesus was - because he 'thought she was much older.'

One other excerpt revealed by Taylor even appears to blame his victims for their predicament, saying: 'They are here against their will because they made a mistake of getting in a car with a total stranger.'

Castro has been charged with four 
counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape. Two of his brothers were 
also arrested on Monday, but have not been charged in connection to the 
case.

Police announced the charges on Wednesday - two days after Castro and his two brothers Pedro and Onil were arrested.

Castro will make his first court appearance on Thursday amid tight security at Cleveland Municipal Court.

In a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, police chief Ed Tomba said the women did not have any opportunity to escape and had only been outside the house twice in the last ten years.

'We were told they left the house and went into the garage in disguise. They never left the property.'

He added: 'The first time they have been outside the house in ten years was when they escaped from the house' he said.

He said Castro had been cooperating fully with police and had made a detailed statement having read his rights.
