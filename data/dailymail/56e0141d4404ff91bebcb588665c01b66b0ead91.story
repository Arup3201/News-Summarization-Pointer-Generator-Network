Newcastle winger Rolando Aarons is still waiting for the club to open talks over a new contract, with Bundesliga side Schalke interested in signing the player who first caught the eye during a pre-season tournament in Gelsenkirchen.

Sportsmail understands that Aarons and United are yet to sit down to discuss an improvement to his first professional deal, signed only in April and set to expire in the summer of 2016.

The player’s representatives are surprised by the delay and hope the 19-year-old will be rewarded for his senior breakthrough and involvement in the England Under 20 set-up, where he has won an admirer in Roy Hodgson.

The Three Lions boss is not the only one impressed by the Jamaican-born teenager. Manchester City and Liverpool are both circling, but it is the interest from Schalke which is strongest.

They noted Aarons’ name back in August when the then unknown wideman lit up a four-team tournament at the Veltins Arena.

Indeed, he scored his first senior goal in a 3-1 win over the hosts and his performance that weekend won him permanent elevation to Alan Pardew’s first-team ranks.

Aarons, though, is currently sidelined with a hamstring problem and will miss Saturday's visit of Queens Park Rangers.

Newcastle – victorious in their last five in all competitions – will be without injured skipper Fabricio Coloccini and vice-captain Cheick Tiote, while Steven Taylor and Mehdi Abeid are also absent.

Striker Papiss Cisse is still struggling for his fitness – despite scoring in midweek for Senegal – and will not start, meaning Ayoze Perez will again lead the line.

The 21-year-old Spaniard has scored three in three – his last an exquisite back-heel in the victory at West Brom – and has been the subject of headlines comparing him to some of the club’s great No 9s, not that Pardew welcomes such exposure.

‘Some of the headlines have been way off the mark – the new Alan Shearer, the new Andy Cole,’ said the United boss.

‘This is a boy who has played three games. Those players are legends and have done it all.

‘But at the moment he’s fearless. He’s got the wind in his sails and is going along very nicely. He’s been very sharp in training. He’s a threat.

‘If you take your eye off him he’s a predator. I’m sure QPR will be having conversations of how to look after him. He’s difficult to pin down, his movement is very clever.

‘He is just setting foot in the Premier League, but I have to say he’s done really well so far. I’m pleased with him. He’s a smashing player and is low maintenance.’

Meanwhile, Pardew has defended his decision to tell Jonas Gutierrez to find a new club after the player first returned from testicular cancer treatment last December.

The 31-year-old is due back on Tyneside next month having successfully fought the illness for a second time and has spoken in his homeland of his disappointment with events of 12 months ago.

But Pardew said: ‘It was a pure football decision and those are decisions that have to be made.

‘It’s difficult – when you’ve said to a player to get a new club and unfortunately the illness has come.

‘You try to be supportive but, of course, the players wants to find a bit more assurance than that.

‘But that decision was a 100 per cent football decision. I want to invite Jonas back and give him the best possible chance when he returns.

‘What he has done is absolutely marvellous, to recover like he has.

‘We’re very proud of what he’s done.’
