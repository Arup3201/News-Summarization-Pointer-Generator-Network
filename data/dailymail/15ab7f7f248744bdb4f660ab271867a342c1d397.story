West Ham United’s dealings on January transfer deadline day were certainly nothing to make a song and dance about.

Sam Allardyce’s side made moves for eight players on Monday but saw them all collapse in calamitous fashion.

The manner in which the moves collapsed will disappoint Allardyce but his current crop of players aren’t letting the lack of new signings get them down.

In fact recent posts from Alex Songs’ Instagram account suggest the squad are in fine tune ahead of the Manchester United game on Sunday as they teamed up to create a band.

Song is joined by midfielders Mark Noble, Kevin Nolan, Steward Downing and Cheikhou Kouyate as they create a reggae band with the Barcelona loanee as the lead singer.

The five-piece band donned outfits and played instruments for charity with Song writing on social media they were performing in aid of NSPCC and the Autism Society.

West Ham fans will be hoping their summer transfer deals go a lot smoother than they did on Monday as Allardyce aims to snap up loan players on permanent deals.

Both Song and Arsenal defender Carl Jenkinson have impressed during stints at Upton Park this season and both are wanted on permanent deals by the east London club.
