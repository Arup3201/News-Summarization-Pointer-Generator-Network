Samsung has unveiled a video content app that will compliment - and hopefully boost interest in - its Gear VR virtual reality headset.

Milk VR will provide free, immersive, 360° content to users and will offer sports, music and even action videos.

The launch follows the release of Milk Video and Milk Music.

It is thought that the Milk videos will last between one and 10 minutes and come in both 2K and 4K formats.

Samsung tweeted a video about the new app but is yet to release any other details about the software. 

The company's $199.99 virtual reality headset was officially launched in September and a full-scale public roll out is expected in early 2015.

Called the Samsung Gear VR, users slip a Note 4 tablet into the headset to create a screen.

The concept was developed with Oculus, the VR firm bought by Facebook.

'Powered by Oculus technology, the Samsung Gear VR delivers a completely new way to experience and consume mobile content,' Samsung said. 

It is believed Samsung provided the hardware, while Oculus provided the software. Its consumer headset, called the Rift, is not expected to go on sale to the public until next year.

'The Samsung Gear VR goes far beyond expectations of how mobile technology can be used to consume content, and is a powerful representation of the progressive innovation of the Gear series,' said JK Shin, President and CEO of IT & Mobile Communications Division at Samsung Electronics, when he launched the headset earlier this year.

'We are pleased to have partnered with Oculus VR to bring this incredibly immersive mobile content experience to consumers.'

The firm has also partnered with several game development firms to develop content for the gadget.

'With the Gear VR Innovator Edition, users can sit in the best seat of a theater, can be on-stage of a performance with full 360 3D video, and can enjoy gaming like it's never been seen before – inside stunning worlds where imagination becomes reality,' Samsung said.

Oculus 360 Videos and Oculus 360 Photos are experiences that allow you to playback panoramic content in VR.

Samsung has also partnered with several game development firms to develop content for the gadget.

Oculus said it will also develop software for the device, including a VR cinema and photo viewer.

'The magic of a completely portable and wireless VR headset is easy to underestimate until you have experienced it,' said John Carmack, Oculus CTO.

'We don't have the raw horsepower of a high end gaming PC yet, but there are valuable compensations that make it a very interesting trade off, and many developers will thrive on the platform, especially as it improves at the rapid pace of the mobile ecosystem.

Journalists were able to try the headset at Samsung's launch in Berlin earlier this year

'Experiencing mobile VR is like when you first tried a decent desktop VR experience — there is a sense that you are glimpsing something from the future. 

'This is science fiction made real, and it's only just the beginning.'

The two firms have been working on the project for a year, Carmack revealed.
