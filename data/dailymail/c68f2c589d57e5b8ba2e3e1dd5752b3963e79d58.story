It's been referred to as one of the 'daftest contests in the racing calendar' but it didn't put off dozens of people from donning a pantomime horse outfit and running around London this morning.

The London Pantomime Horse race, now in its fifth year, was billed as the sci-fi edition and welcomed  'horses' dressed in Jedi capes - and a zebra - along with several Princess Leia's and a battalion of Stormtroopers.

Television horse racing pundit John McCririck was on hand with his infamous deer-stalker as he provided commentary and expert tips on which panto pairing the crowds should back.

Hundreds of supporters turned out to watch Darth Vader and R2D2 emerge from Greenwich's Cutty Sark in an opening ceremony, led by the Black Knight's Drum and Bugle Corp, ahead of the race's 11am kick-off.

Mark Biddiss, founder of the bizarre festive event, which raises funds for the Demelza children’s hospice in south east London, described it as 'unashamedly daft but gloriously funny to witness'.

All of the four-footed contestants were invited  to an 'after race Christmas party' at a nearby pub to crown the winners - Mike Wood and Adam Stakemire, which was hosted by comedian Stephen Frost and featured live music from The Star Wars Canteena Band.
