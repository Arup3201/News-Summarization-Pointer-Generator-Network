A dilapidated cottage with rotting walls covered in graffiti is set to sell for more than $2 million when it goes to auction next week.

The property in trendy, inner-city Melbourne suburb Richmond comes with a planning permit for the construction of four townhouses, one of which will have to incorporate the rundown cottage because it is protected by a heritage overlay.

This comes as new figures show house prices in Australian capital cities have recorded their strongest gains in winter since 2007, increasing by 4.2 percent in the three months to the end of August.

The lift in capital gains was driven by Melbourne which recorded a 6.4 percent increase, beating Sydney which recorded a 5 percent increase.

Biggin & Scott property marketing agent Allan Cove, who is in charge of the Richmond property at 336 Burnley St, said it had attracted a lot of interest - mainly from builders and developers.

'We're expecting bidding to start at the $2 million mark,' Mr Cove told Daily Mail Australia.

'I know I've got interest over into the early $2 million area, but I don't know if it would get as much as $2.5 million.

'Whether it does or not the auction will tell the story there.'

The planning permit will allow developers to build three three-bedroom townhouses and one four-bedroom townhouse, ranging in size from 175 to 249 square metres.

The property will go to auction at 1pm on September 12.

Meanwhile, RP Data figures showed Melbourne and Sydney were the only capital cities to record double-digit dwelling value growth over the past year.

Melbourne outperformed Sydney over winter but Sydney was the leader year-on-year, with house prices increasing 16.2 percent in Sydney compared with 11.7 percent in Melbourne.

All other capital cities trailed behind with Adelaide recording a 5.9 percent rise year-on-year, followed by Brisbane with 5.4 percent, Darwin with 5.4 percent, Perth with 3.5 percent, Hobart 2.8 percent and Canberra with 1.4 percent.

RP Data research director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne housing markets were driving these two tier conditions.

He added that he expected dwelling values to increase again this Spring.

'Considering the ongoing high rate of auction clearance rates, a generally rapid rate of sale and the ongoing low interest rate environment, it's likely that dwelling values rise even further over the next three months,' Mr Lawless said.

'Consumer confidence is also moving in the right direction now after the post-budget slump which will add fuel to the exuberant buying and selling conditions we have seen during winter.'

The planning permit will allow developers to build three three-bedroom townhouses and one four-bedroom townhouse, ranging in size from 175 to 249 square metres

The property comprises a generally rectangular 771 square metre site zoned R1Z General Residential Zone with a Burnley Street frontage of 13.5 square metres, a depth of 57.5 metres and frontage to Canterbury Street providing access at the rear
