Manchester United decided to cut their losses on two of Sir Alex Ferguson's worst flops on deadline day as Anderson and Wilfried Zaha were both pushed through the Old Trafford exit door.

Anderson, who sealed a £25.7million move to Manchester United back in 2007, was allowed to leave Louis van Gaal's side on a free transfer in order to complete a move back to his native Brazil.

Zaha was also allowed to return to familiar surroundings as he rejoined Crystal Palace for a fee around £6m.

Zaha sealed a permanent switch back to SE25 by signing a five-and-a-half year deal to rejoin the Eagles 

The 22-year-old will go down in history as Ferguson's last signing at the Red Devils but he did not have the chance of working under the Scotsman before the former  manager's retirement in 2013.

Here, Sportsmail provides a countdown of Ferguson's worst 10 signings during his outstanding 26-year reign at Manchester United.

10 - Zoran Tosic (£7million) January 2009 - June 2010

Appearances: 4

Goals: 0

Ferguson decided to fork out £7m on Serbian winger Tosic in January 2009 as he went in search of a long-term replacement for Ryan Giggs.

The former Manchester United manager claimed he had been monitoring Tosic for a number of years but the player, now 27, failed to live up to expectations at Old Trafford.

Tosic was shipped out on loan to Cologne before eventually completing a move to CSKA Moscow for an undisclosed fee.

9 - David Bellion (£3m) July 2003 - May 2006

Appearances: 40

Goals: 8

Bellion was billed as the 'next Thierry Henry' when he arrived at Old Trafford as a 20-year-old striker.

Manchester United beat off fierce competition to sign the Frenchman from Sunderland back in July 2003 on a Bosman before eventually having to pay £3m in compensation.

However, Bellion joined Bordeaux after struggling to cope with the demands of life at Old Trafford.

David Bellion scored just eight goals in 40 appearances at Manchester United

8 - Juan Sebastian Veron (£28.1m) July 2001 - August 2003

Appearances: 82

Goals: 11

Veron failed to establish himself in English football after moving to Manchester United for just shy of £30m.

Ferguson said Veron 'was a world-class footballer' who would bring 'a personality to the team', however, the big-money signing disrupted the balance of Manchester United's midfield.

The former Lazio and Parma playmaker, who was sold to Chelsea in 2003, was unable to form a successful partnership with then Manchester United stars Roy Keane and Paul Scholes.

7 - Kleberson (£6.5m) August 2003 - August 2005

Appearances: 30

Goals: 2

Brazilian World Cup winner Kleberson was unveiled as a Manchester United player on the same day as Cristiano Ronaldo.

The central midfielder was seen as the big-name signing along alongside the relatively unknown Ronaldo - but we all know which player proved to be the better purchase.

Kleberson was signed to replace Veron, but he proved to be just as bad.

6 - Wilfried Zaha (£15m) - January 2013 - February 2015

Appearances: 4

Goals: 0

Zaha was afforded just 28 minutes of Premier League football to show he was worthy of rubbing shoulders with the likes of Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Co.

The England international failed to impress both David Moyes and Van Gaal during his brief stint at United.

Ferguson's last signing will be hoping to prove the doubters wrong at former club Palace after sealing a permanent move back to Selhurst Park.

5 - Ralph Milne (£170,000) - November 1988 - June 1991

Appearances: 23

Goals: 2

Ferguson plucked Milne from Bristol City for a mere £170,000 but has openly stated that the Scottish midfielder was one of his worst buys.

Speaking in November 2009, Ferguson said: 'I only paid £170,000 but still get condemned for it.'

Milne was unable to find another professional club after leaving United on a permanent basis.

4 - Eric Djemba-Djemba (£3.5m) - July 2003 - January 2005

Appearances: 39

Goals: 2

'He's so good they named him twice,' was the phrase which was circling around United's messageboards when Ferguson signed the defensive midfielder from Nantes.

Djemba-Djemba was seen as a potential long-term replacement for Keane but he spent the majority of his Old Trafford career on the bench.

The fact that Djemba-Djemba is now playing for Persebaya Surabaya in Indonesia tells you all you need to know about his failure to establish himself in Europe.

3 - Massimo Taibi (£4.5m) - August 1999 - July 2000

Appearances: 4

Ferguson's biggest failure in the transfer market was being unable to find a suitable replacement for Peter Schmeichel.

Taibi was by far the worst he signed in an attempt to fill the gigantic void following the Great Dane's departure.

He is remembered for his appalling error against Southampton in September 1999 and for conceding five goals against Chelsea in his final appearance for the Red Devils.

Italian goalkeeper Massimo Taibi made several high-profile blunders during his brief stint at the Red Devils 

2 - Anderson (£26m) - July 2007 - February 2015

Appearances: 179

Goals: 9

Ferguson launched a £26m move for Anderson after his brother Martin said he was 'better than Rooney'.

The Brazilian's potential was clear to see with the midfielder putting in fine performances against the likes of Arsenal and Liverpool during the early stages of his United career.

However Anderson, who was billed as the next Scholes, struggled with fitness during his time in Manchester and has now returned to Brazil after his contract was cancelled.

1 - Bebe (£7m) - August 2010 - July 2014

Appearances: 7 

Goals: 1

Ferguson reportedly beat off competition from La Liga giants Real Madrid to sign Bebe - the first player he signed without watching extensive video footage of.

A Manchester United scout was 'adamant' that Ferguson had to move quickly to conclude a deal for the Portuguese forward due to Real Madrid's interest.

Bebe recently said 'I thought Manchester United were joking' when they made a move for him in August 2010, which shows just how bizarre his transfer to the Theatre of Dreams proved to be.
