Your mobile phone can be the perfect tool for spies who want to track your movements.

And with recent revelations that authorities can remotely enable the microphone on Android phones, mobile privacy concerns have risen to the top of the agenda.

Now, Brooklyn-based designer Adam Harvey is hoping to cash in on these concerns with his $85 (£55) signal-blocking smartphone case named ‘OFF Pocket.’

The OFF Pocket blocks every signal your phone emits or receives- including 3G, 4G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS

The interior fabric is comprised of metal-covered fibres that shield your phone from signals of up to 100dB between 800MHz-2.4GHz. For comparison, various law-enforcement forensic bags offer 80dB of shielding

The OFF Pocket claims to block every signal your phone emits or receives- including 3G, 4G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS.

To use it, you simply have to place your phone inside the case and close it.

‘Your phone is now OFF,’ claims Mr Harvey, adding that it is: ‘Untrackable. Unhackable. Undistractable.’

Most people are willing to take their mobile phone wherever they go. 
According to research by Morgan Stanley, 91 per cent of today people keep their mobile phone within 3 feet of them, 24 hours a day

‘I began working on the OFF Pocket in 2011 because I wanted more control over my privacy. Not just to protect my data, but also to unplug once in a while,’ said Mr Harvey.

The OFF Pocket has been tested on all
major networks and is compatible with mobile phone hardware including 
iPhones, Samsung, Motorola, Sony, BlackBerrys and Nokia.

The accessory was initially designed as a
permanent pocket in a pair of shorts. However, the concept was too 
difficult to get off the ground.

The OFF Pocket was officially released earlier this year but the team is now hoping to place its first large production order funded through its Kickstarter campaign

The design team hopes to ship the first batch of cases towards the end of September

During the summer of last year, Mr Harvey met Johanna Bloomfield, a fashion designer and materials consultant living in New York.

Over the next year, they collaborated on the project, made dozens of prototypes and subjected them to testing in the studio using diagnostic tools as well as various outdoor locations.

The OFF Pocket was officially released earlier this year but the team is now hoping to place its first large production order funded through its Kickstarter campaign.

‘The OFF Pocket provides you with a physical barrier between your phone and the outside world, while Airplane Mode relies on a phone's software,’ said Mr Harvey.

‘Relying on software is never as safe as relying on a physical barrier.’

The design team hopes to ship the first batch of cases towards the end of September.

Ever wondered who can find out where you are and discover what you’re doing by looking at your mobile data?

The answer, according to security researcher, Brendan O’Connor, is just about anyone.

That is, anyone, who has access to a Raspberry Pi Model A computer, a few over-the-counter sensors and a plastic box.

With $57 (£37) Mr O’Connor managed to create a device, named ‘creepyDOL’, which can track the movement of everyone on the street.

The sensors in the device looked at all the wireless traffic emitted by every nearby wireless device, including smartphones and tablets.

He then connected each of the boxes to a command and control system, and constructed a data visualisation system to monitor what the sensors picked up.

Mr O’Connor found that he could pick up the websites he browsed when he connected to a public Wi-Fi.

‘Actually it’s not hard,’ said Mr O’Connor in a New York Times interview. ‘It’s terrifyingly easy.’
