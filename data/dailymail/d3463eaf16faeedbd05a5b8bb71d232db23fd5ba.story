A Minnesota woman's newborn son was 
mistakenly given to the wrong mother, who breastfed the infant before 
doctors discovered the mixup, it has emerged.

Both mothers and the baby had to 
undergo blood testing for hepatitis and HIV, diseases that can be 
transmitted through breastfeeding, after the incident at Abbott 
Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis. 

Tammy Van Dyke, the woman whose baby was given to a stranger, said she had left her son Cody in the nursery overnight as she attempted to get some rest - but wishes she never had.

She awoke the next morning to find two 
people in her hospital room to tell her that Cody had been placed in the
wrong bassinet in the nursery and given to another woman to breastfeed.

Fears: Tammy Van Dyke holds her newborn son Cody, who was given to a different woman to breastfeed

'When the woman was breastfeeding my son she felt like something
was wrong,' Tammy told the Minneapolis Star Tribune. 'And she looked at the ID band on his ankle and realised 
that she had the wrong child, that she had my son.'

The woman immediately hit the nurse button and summoned her back to the room to take the baby away.

Tammy struggled to contain her tears as branded the mistake an 'oversight' by the nurse, who had failed to compare the child's identification wrist band against the mother's.

'My advice would be - and I'm sure this is a rare occurrence and never happens - is don't put your baby in the nursery because you don't know what could happen,' she said.

Mixup: The other mother noticed something was wrong when she started breastfeeding Cody

Horrifying: She checked the baby's identification tag and discovered the boy was not her child

'You think you're going to get your baby back and you might not. I'm very lucky that I did get him back and everything was OK.'

The hospital issued Van Dyke a letter
of apology and an admission of negligence, which stated that the babies
were accidentally placed in the wrong bassinets in the hospital 
nursery.

Abbott places 
matching wristbands on every newborn and its mother to prevent mixups 
such as this one, according to hospital officials.

'While
hospital procedures require staff to match codes on the infant’s and 
mother’s identification bands in order to prevent incidents like this, 
it appears these procedures were not followed in this case,' Abbott 
hospital said in a statement.

The
hospital is investigating the matter to try and find out what went 
wrong and how the wrong baby was placed in a mother's hands.

'As far as we know, this has never happened before at Abbott,' Gloria O'Connell, a spokeswoman for the hospital, told the Minneapolis Star Tribune.

'Apparently, somebody didn't follow 
procedure, so that's what we're trying to figure out,' she said. 'And 
there will be consequences.'

Scene: The Minneapolis hospital issued an apology and said the wrist bands had not been checked, as is policy

Abbott isn't the first hospital to mistakenly switch babies at birth.

In March, a similar mistake occurred at Virginia Regional Medical Center, where a newborn was brought to the wrong mother and, like at Abbott, breastfed by the stranger before doctors discovered the mistake. 

The hospital installed a new digital baby-mother matching system following the mix-up to ensure that it wouldn't happen again. 

It's unclear whether Abbott is planning similar systematic changes to its baby-mother matching system.

Relief: Tammy said she feels lucky that nothing worse happened to her son after the 'oversight'

'On behalf of Abbott Northwestern, I 
am very sorry this incident occurred,' said Penny Wheeler, a practicing 
obstetrician and Chief Clinical Officer of Allina Health, which owns 
Abbott Northwestern.

'Providing the best possible patient experience and
care quality is our foremost concern and this incident should not have 
occurred.

'As an obstetrician, I have 
personally seen verification of the infant’s identifying name band 
matched correctly with the mother’s on hundreds of occasions. It is 
extremely unfortunate that was not the case this time.

'We sincerely 
apologize to the involved families and will make certain we understand 
why our procedures were not appropriately followed in this case.'
