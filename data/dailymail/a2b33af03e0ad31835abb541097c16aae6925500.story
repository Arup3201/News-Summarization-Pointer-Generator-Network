Paranoid schizophrenic Leslie Gadsby, who killed his father after being freed because a hospital mental health ward was full, went on to stab his mother to death inside his secure unit

A paranoid schizophrenic who killed his father after being freed because a hospital mental health ward was full went on to stab his mother to death inside his secure unit.

An independent report into Edna Gadsby's death found that both she and her taxi driver son Leslie were 'seriously failed' by mental health professionals at Mersey Care NHS trust. 

After suffering paranoid hallucinations Gadbsy, now 42, was admitted to a hospital mental health unit in 2003 but there were no beds available, leaving him free to bludgeon his father Arthur to death with a hammer in their family kitchen in Gateacre, Liverpool, just two days later.

He was given a conditional discharge following his father's death, but while he was living at the secure Scott Clinic mental health centre in Stoneycroft in 2010 he stabbed Mrs Gadsby, 70, in the throat before going downstairs to chat to social workers about Scrabble.

The damning  report - compiled by a panel of doctors and mental health experts - outlined multiple failings by the Mersey Care NHS Trust and independent charity Imagine, who ran the facility in Tuebrook.

Among the failings listed in the report were that Mrs Gadsby was found dead inside his flat - which was supposed to be a '24-hour mental health facility', and that she had been placed in 'unmitigated risk'

Gadsby was first diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia in 2003, and admitted to hospital shortly afterwards.

However, officials were unable to find a bed for him until two days later.

When a carer called to organise picking him up to take him to hospital, a police officer answered and said he had killed his father by bludgeoning him with a hammer in the kitchen of the family home.

He received a conditional discharge two years after the killing of his father, but the report found that mental health workers 'did not recognise the level of risk he posed to himself and others', and told him to move to a more independent flat in 2010.

Just days later, his mother came to visit the flat, where she was was brutally stabbed. Gadsby later returned to the family home to set it alight.

Following his release on conditional discharge, Gadsby was meant to be monitored 24 hours a day and contact with his mother was supposed to be carefully supervised.

However, the report found that ‘unacceptable’ planning failures 'in effect left Mr Gadsby to regulate his own activities and set his own boundaries.'

The report said this damning 'failing of duty of care' left the seriously ill man with no safety net strong enough to ensure his safety, or the safety of his mother.

While Gadsby was living at a secure Scott Clinic mental health centre in Stoneycroft in 2010 he stabbed Edna Gadsby, 70, in the throat before going downstairs to chat to social workers about Scrabble

He had even tried to mutilate himself with a broken toothbrush while under watch, thinking that it was his testosterone that had made him aggressive.

Investigators ruled that had Gadsby been 'subject to robust supervision' the risk of him killing his mother would have been 'substantially reduced'.

They admitted that there was a serious causal link between lack of care and treatment, and the death of Mrs Gadsby.

The 400-page document also found there was no system to detect a relapse in his mental state, meaning that officials consistently reported back that he was doing well and recommended moving him to a more independent flat.

The Gadsby family were even forced to make their own arrangements to protect Mrs Gadsby after officials failed to manage his release - making 'no effort' to educate or support them.

The damning report into failings by the Mersey Care NHS Trust and independent charity Imagine, who ran the Scott Clinic facility in Tuebrook found that: 

Gadsby was said to have a 'loving relationship with both his parents' and worked for 10 years as a taxi driver in Liverpool before being diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia.

After the death of her husband,  long-suffering Mrs Gadsby, who was also seriously wounded, told officers she 'felt it would have been better if her son had killed her too'.

But she continued to visit her son and tried to rebuild a relationship with him despite protests from concerned family members who told her 'she should have locked him up and throw away the key.'

Gadsby's uncle even contacted officials to express his concern that Gadsby was on bail and might try and approach his mother, but social workers had said he was ‘happy and relaxed’.

Meanwhile, Gadsby had made a secret trip to the house of an ex-girlfriend, appearing at her door wearing just a pair of tights over his underwear and offering her a cheque for £7,800, which the report said was a classic sign of relapse for his condition.

He had failed to take his anti-psychotic medication properly for years, and had never been offered Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) - a key road to recovery for thousands of mental health patients.

Just five months after brutally killing his father after an argument over money, his risk of aggression and violence was deemed ‘low’ by carers, despite him suffering 'paranoid ideas about his neighbours and members of his family.'

Gadsby also thought people could read his thoughts and were monitoring his movements on a daily basis leaving him wary of authority and scared of being sectioned.

Following his discharge to the Scott Clinic in late 2006, a social worker noted that he 'still presents a risk in keeping things to himself and letting them build up until it’s too late.'

The report concluded that it was hoped it would hightlight failings from the tragic case and put measures in place to stop any future incidents after Gadsby and his family were left with 'no support' to help develop strategies to cope with his illness, leaving him 'vulnerable to relapse'.

Mersey Care has vowed to improve care for mentally ill patients after the 'devastating report'.

The investigation recommended that the Scott Clinic should have a system where workers are aware if patients have guests, and that the staff flat should be moved to the ground floor. 

At the time of Mrs Gadsby’s death, her son’s flat was on the ground floor, with staff upstairs.

The report also recommend that injured family members of mentally ill people be provided with a ‘support package’, as well as improved communication throughout.  

'It’s a devastating report, it’s devastating for the Gadsby family and it’s devastating for me as a nurse,' said Ray Walker, Executive Director of Nursing and Social Care for Mersey Care NHS Trust.

'What’s important in these situations is to find out how you can learn from those mistakes and ensure those things don’t happen again. 

'We were aware of some of the findings coming out of the independent report, which means we were able to implement some changes some time ago and we’re actioning on a number of fronts and have been able to progress in a number of things, like better team-working and better risk-assessment.

'It’s been a very difficult lesson for us to learn, but it’s provided us with an opportunity to help us going forward.

'It really is a matter of a number of things that come together at the same time, it was a cumulative effect of a number of failings.

'Not to minimise those failings, they were important things, but actually it was all together that those problems resulted in the death.

'It’s been over five years, and the director of patient safety has remained in contact with the family. They’ve conducted themselves in a very respectful manner, and the family have been very dignified throughout the process and they want to make sure this kind of thing doesn’t happen again - and we support them in that.

'This has been devastating for me personally as a nurse, and devastating for me personally. This kind of thing stays with you for a career.

'It changes the way you practice, and what’s important is that you learn those lessons - and the people involved in this have learnt those lessons very sharply.'

The Trust also hopes to improve its risk assessment programme when patients are moved within facilities, after Gadsby was recommended for a move - despite telling carers on at least two occasions that he felt uncomfortable doing so.
