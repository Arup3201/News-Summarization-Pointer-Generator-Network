A recent college graduate biking across the country to raise money for a cancer charity was struck and killed this week by a truck.

Jamie Roberts, 24, of Baltimore, Maryland, was riding through rural Kentucky with friends and several other recent grads for the Ulman Cancer Fund when the incident occurred.

Five members of the contingent were on the side of a remote, winding two-lane country road about 30 miles north of Lexington at around 3.30 p.m. waiting for Roberts to change one of her tires when tragedy struck, according to reports.

‘This is a very rural road, not much in the way of shoulders, a lot of curves and hills which again, makes it dangerous for both people, bicyclists and the vehicles involved.  It is a very troubling situation,’ Scott County Sheriff's Deputy Jearl Porter told WTVQ.

Both Roberts and another rider were struck by the pickup truck, the other person suffered minor injuries, police told the Georgetown News-Graphic. Roberts was pronounced dead at the scene.

Authorities are still working to determine how the driver, who remained at the scene and is cooperating with investigators, ran into them.

‘At this point we know at least some of them were off the side of the road, as to where the two that were struck were, in comparison to the roadway itself at the time of the collision is what we're still trying to determine,’ Porter told WKYT.

Under investigation: Police are working to determine the cause of the incident while they await the results of a toxicology test on the driver

Police are working to determine if alcohol or drugs played a role in the tragedy as they await of a toxicology test performed on the driver, WTVQ reported.

Roberts wrote on the Ulman Cancer Fund website that her grandfather died of lung cancer when she was only 14-years-old and that she was dedicating her ride to a friend whose parents both beat cancer in the past few years.

She also wrote about being inspired to set off on the journey by two friends who completed it last year and wanting to ‘make a difference in someone’s life’ by ‘following their footsteps.’

The ‘retired’ college athlete added: ‘I am excited to face what will undoubtedly be the most difficult physical challenge of my life. I love to travel and I have a hard time saying no to adventures!’

The group was 10 days into what was expected to be a 34-day trip across the country from Baltimore’s Inner Harbor to Portland, Orgeon, according to a blog written by friend Ariana Staffen.

They had experiences weather-related delays in Ohio before making their way into Kentucky, but remained reasonably on schedule.

‘This passionate young woman, so precious to her family and loved ones, lost her life in a tragic accident today as she rode across America to raise funds and awareness for young adults fighting cancer,’ the fund said in a statement.

‘Jamie’s selflessness, her commitment to serving others and her deep devotion to her friends, family and fellow riders was apparent to everyone who knew her.’

Riders planned to resume riding across the country, now also in her honor, on Monday, the fund said.

Roberts raised $15,246 of the $6,000 goal she had set, according to her fundraising page.

Last year’s effort saw 127 riders raise almost $775,000 for young adults with cancer, the organization said.
