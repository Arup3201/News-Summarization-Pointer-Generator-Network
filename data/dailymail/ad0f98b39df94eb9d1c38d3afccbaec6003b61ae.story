The streaming powerhouse announced on Wednesday that it will be airing every episode of Friends from January 1 2015 in the U.S. and Canada.

Netflix will even feature some never aired episodes of the 90s TV classic in which Joey and Rachel become a couple, reports TV Line.

They're back: Ross, Rachel, Monica, Joey, Phoebe, and Chandler can be watched on Netflix starting January 1

Collaboration: Netflix and some recognizable characters from Friends worked on a video collaboration to announce the show's streaming on Netflix starting New Years Day

Friends originally ran from 1994 to 2004 and followed a group of friends living in New York City.

Now viewers in Canada and the U.S. will once again get to relive the trials and tribulations of Rachel, Monica, Phoebe, Joey, Chandler and Ross.

The Verge reports that the sitcom is one of the most popular television shows of all time and is a huge snag for Netflix.

To celebrate the return of Friends, Netflix has put together a music video with a familiar sounding song.

Sound familiar: The Rembrandts band knows for singing the friends theme song 'I'll Be There For You' starred in a the video announcing the show's appearance on Netflix  

The Rembrandts, the band responsible for the show's I'll Be There For You theme song together with love-stricken Barista Gunther star in a video paying homage to the show.

At the end of the tune, Gunther carries the singer’s mugs that read, 'I love Netflix.'

With more and more television being streamed online, HBO has announced that it is to start offering HBO Go as a standalone product so that viewers longing to watch Game of Thrones, True Detective and Veep will no longer have to pay big bucks for cable and satellite contracts.

Streaming services like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Instant Video have rapidly grown in popularity.  

And those who miss Friends will have a friend in Netflix in 2015. 

To date, the deal that brings Friends to Netflix has only been confirmed for the U.S. and Canada.
