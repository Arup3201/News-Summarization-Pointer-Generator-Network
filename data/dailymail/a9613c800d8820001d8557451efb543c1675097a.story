The Ebola virus killed 84 people in just three days last week, bringing the global death toll to 1,229, the World Health Organisation revealed today.

It comes as 17 patients suspected of having Ebola who disappeared after a health 
centre in Liberia was attacked by a mob have been traced.

But local clinics are refusing help to those who have been found, including a 10-year-old boy, for fear they will be infected with the deadly virus.

Ten-year-old Saah Exco, is among the patients who was pulled out of the holding centre for suspected Ebola patients.

On Saturday, residents of the West Point slum in Liberia's capital of Monrovia launched the raid- which was triggered by fears that people with the disease were being brought there from all over the country, the Information Ministry said

The
 latest figures came as it emerged that a 48-year-old British woman who 
collapsed and died in Austria following a trip to Nigeria did not die 
from the disease.

Head of 
the regional health board in Austria, Franz Katzgraber, said tests had 
ruled out the virus but the cause of death remained unknown.

The woman had travelled from Nigeria to Germany where she then flew back to Austria to her home at Vomp, a town in the Austrian state of Tyrol.

An autopsy will now be carried out to confirm the cause of death.
