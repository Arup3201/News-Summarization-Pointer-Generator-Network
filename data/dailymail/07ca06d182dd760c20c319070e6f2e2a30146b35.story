At this time of year, my skin is as grey as the rain-leaden skies. Halloween has come and gone, leaving me with a deathly pallor and ghoulish under-eye bags. This is the season when a good facial really can make all the difference.

I want to recapture that lost summer glow. I want my eye bags to melt away. I want my face to be de-puffed - in short, I want to get back the will to live.

I'm not looking to be pampered, just for down-and-dirty instant gratification.

DNA facials: No-fuss Debbie Thomas is 'all about the results'

There is only one place to go. The place where I return year after year, like a slightly weather-beaten homing pigeon.

Up a rather dingy flight of stairs, past magazine racks stuffed with browning back-copies of Hello! and whingeing hairdresser's assistants, past the tiny toilet - and into the three-room skincare empire of Debbie Thomas.

Thomas doesn't have much time for small-talk. It's 8.15am, and I'm the first client of her day, a day that won't end until gone 9pm. She doesn't bother much with glamour, either. No scented candles or wafty whale music in her treatment rooms, just an array of serious-looking machinery, winking ominously in the wintry gloom.

Sarah Vine: 'She shrunk my chins!'

Her hair is tied tightly back, her sleeves are rolled up and she's scrubbing her hands.

Do I need to remove my top? 'Up to you,' she says, as she flicks a few switches and the machines hum into life. 'Ready?' And off we go.

Thomas is what's known in the business as a 'superfacialist'. She's not here to make me feel good, to chat or to de-stress me. She is here to perform my annual skin MOT.

She calls it her DNA facial, not because it contains any deoxyribonucleic acid, but because it goes to the core of each client's individual needs.

She is, as she likes to remind me when I grimace at the sight of another torturous-looking contraption, 'all about the results'.

Her knowledge is based on years of experience - she has worked with both Ole Henrikkson (the flamboyant former dancer-turned-LA-skin guru) and Dr Frances Prenna Jones (one of London's most trusted skin doctors). She knows what works and what doesn't, what’s harmless and what's not. And it's best not to argue with her.

She begins with a Skinceuticals Gel Peel GL, which combines glycol and lactic acids to exfoliate, brighten and hydrate the skin, followed by targeted hydrodermabrasion (basically deep exfoliation using water), again to cleanse and hydrate.

The next bit, however, is a little scary. Radio frequency for my jawline. My double chin and incipient jowls are one of the things that depress me most about my reflection. This treatment involves massaging the offending areas with a rather hot nozzle.

This, apparently, zaps fatty deposits and tightens the skin. It's also quite uncomfortable - although not impossibly so.

Afterwards, there's some lymph drainage using a funny little sucking device, then some extremely firm ('I don't do namby-pamby') and rather heavenly massage using a masque by a Swiss skincare brand called Valmont (www.evalmont.com).

All that, and I'm still not done. Time for some red light therapy to stimulate cell regeneration, and then a final once-over with a Valmont serum and SPF cream.

I sit up, slightly stunned. My skin is glowing. My eyes are bright. The shadows have gone. But best of all my double chin has shrunk. Reader, she shrunk my chins!

How do we know it's nearly Christmas? The rosy cheeks of the children as they play in the chill November air? The little robin redbreast busying himself in the garden? Or even the pre-order facility for the Playstation 4 at PC World?

Nope. None of the above. It's the absolute cast-iron guarantee that, around about now, a bunch of half-naked women will start appearing on our screens, chained to snow leopards, snogging wolves or dragging their fingernails down the backs of unsuspecting male models while Alain Delon - or someone who sounds a lot like him - mutters inanities in a comedy French accent.

A little bit of Genius: Scarlett Johansson and Matthew McConaughey

Yes, viewers: it's Christmas perfume ad season!

Chanel has already brought out the big guns: they've got Marilyn Monroe, a wise back-to-basics move after last year's disastrous Brad Pitt venture.

But look, here's Dolce & Gabbana, overtaking on the inside with an original short film directed by none other than Martin Scorsese. In moody black and white, and set in New York, it stars two of the most beautiful people on the planet, Matthew McConaughey and Scarlett Johansson.

It's a little bit of genius, actually. Not only does it contain flashes of humour (not generally present in the world of haute perfumery), it has a perfectly plausible narrative - and at no point do either of the protagonists’ clothes accidentally fall off.

Best of all, there are no endangered species, no women covered in gold paint wandering through the snow. And no smut. The closest they get to a clinch is holding hands. 

Does it reflect the fragrance itself? Mmm, not exactly. It's one of those rather banal, black-curranty affairs that fashion houses seem to favour at the moment, nothing special, and unlikely to become a classic.

But the point of a designer fragrance is not what it smells like; it's what it stands for.

Driving through New York in an open-top car with Matthew McConaughey? What more could a girl want for Christmas?
