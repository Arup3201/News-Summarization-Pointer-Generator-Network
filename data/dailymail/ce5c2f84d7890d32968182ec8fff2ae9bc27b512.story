A court in Egypt sentenced 21 people to death today for their involvement in a riot at a football match between Al-Masry and Al-Ahly last February.

74 spectators died in the world's worst football-related disaster in 15 years, when fans of Cairo-based Al-Ahly were attacked by rival club Al-Masry in the Mediterranean city of Port Said.

Violence erupted moments after the final whistle when the home Al-Masry fans set upon travelling supporters in a killing frenzy that lasted 30 minutes.

Many witnesses claimed policemen at the venue did nothing to stop the bloodshed.

The controversial verdict led to further bloodshed, as eight people were killed in protests outside Port Said's main jail.

Tragic: A judge has sentenced 21 people to death following the riot between fans of Port Said's Al-Masry and Cairo's Al-Ahly, in February last year

Arson: Supporters of ousted president Hosni Mubarak were blamed for instigating the riots, in which parts of the Port Said stadium were set on fire

Angry
relatives of those sentenced to death tried to storm the prison to free
the defendants, shooting dead two police officers, according to 
reports.

Egyptian security officials called in the military to restore order, as police fought running battles with the protestors.

Six people were killed when officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets at those demonstrating.

There
were dramatic scenes in the courtroom as relatives of those killed in 
the riot wailed as the judge handed down the verdict.

Many were carrying pictures of the young men killed in the violence on February 1 last year.

The death sentences will be sent to a top religious authority, the Grand Mufti, for approval, as is customary in Egypt.

In a verdict broadcast on state TV, the judge said the remaining 52 defendants would be sentenced at a later date.

Among
them are nine security officials, who are accused of not doing enough 
to protect the 1,200 Al-Ahly fans when 13,000 Al-Masry hooligans armed 
with knives, iron bars and machetes stormed the pitch to get at them.

Desperation: Thousands of desperate supporters trying to board a train after fleeing from the stadium

Running for cover: Players involved in a tie between Al-Masry and Al-Ahly had to flee Port Said Stadium during the riots which claimed 74 lives

Authorities
switched off the stadium lights after the game and, as Al-Ahly 
supporters tried to flee the violence, many were crushed against a 
chained gate until it broke open.

Many were trampled under the weight of the crowd behind.

In
the days leading up to the verdict, Al-Ahly fans warned of bloodshed 
and 'retribution' if death sentences were not handed down.

Hundreds
of Al-Ahly fans gathered outside the Cairo sports club in anticipation 
of the verdict, chanting against the police and the government.

Many hardcore fans, or Ultras, have taken a leading role in political protests over the last two years.

Both
Al-Ahly Ultras and Al-Masry Ultras widely believe that ex-members of 
the ousted regime of Hosni Mubarak helped instigate the attack.

Police did not carry out the customary searches for weapons as fans entered the stadium.

The
Ultras, are among Egypt's rowdiest and are proud of their hatred for 
the police, who were the backbone of Mubarak's authoritarian rule.

The
Ultras from Egypt's sports clubs were engaged in deadly clashes with 
police near the Interior Ministry headquarters in Cairo that killed 42 
people less than three months before the soccer melee in Port Said.

Officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets at those demonstrating outside the prison, killing six people.

The violence during the match last year was the world's worst football related disaster in 15 years.

Revenge: Fans of al-Ahly had promised more violence if the accused did not receive death sentences

Chaos: Egyptian football fans rush to the pitch during the riots. Another 52 people are awaiting sentencing

Fans of Al-Ahly, whose stands were 
attacked by rival club Al-Masry in the 
Mediterranean city of Port Said, had promised more violence if the 
accused did not receive death sentences.

Families of the those killed during the disorder wailed in the courtroom as the judge gave the sentence.

One man fainted, while others wailed and cried in disbelief as they carried pictures of the young men killed in the soccer riot.

The judge said in his statement, read 
live on state TV, that he would announce the verdict for the remaining 
52 defendants at a later date.

While many of those on trial included alleged football hooligans, nine security officials also face charges.

The death sentences will be sent to a top religious authority, the Grand Mufti, for approval, as is customary in Egypt.

Many violent soccer fans, known as Ultras, have taken a leading role in protests over the past two years.

Both
Al-Ahly Ultras and Al-Masry Ultras widely believe that ex-members of 
the ousted regime of Hosni Mubarak helped instigate the attack.

The police are also accused of gross negligence over their handling of the incident.

It is not clear what kind of 
evidence, if any, was presented to the court to back up claims that the 
attack had been orchestrated by regime officials.

Attack: More than 13,000 home fans, armed with knives, iron bars and machetes, to storm the pitch and attack rival Al-Ahly players and their 1,200 supporters

All of the defendants - who were not 
present in the courtroom today for security reasons - have the right to 
appeal against the verdict.

The clashes occurred during a match between Port Said's Al-Masry and Cairo's Al-Ahly, the country's most successful club, on February 1 last year.

The final whistle prompted more than 
13,000 home fans, armed with knives, iron bars and machetes, to storm 
the pitch and attack rival Al-Ahly players and their 1,200 supporters.

Authorities shut off the stadium lights after the game, plunging it into darkness.

In the exit corridor, the fleeing 
crowd pressed against a chained gate until it broke open. Many were 
crushed under the crowd of people trying to flee.

In the days leading up to the 
verdict, Al-Ahly fans warned of bloodshed and 'retribution' if death 
sentences were not handed down.

Hundreds of Al-Ahly fans gathered 
outside the Cairo sports club in anticipation of the verdict, chanting 
against the police and the government.

Red mist: Al-Ahly fans celebrate today's verdict in Cairo

While there has long been bad blood 
between the two rival teams, many blamed police for failing to perform 
usual searches for weapons at the stadium.

The Ultras, 
are among Egypt's rowdiest and are proud of their hatred for the police,
who were the backbone of Mubarak's authoritarian rule.

The Ultras from Egypt's sports clubs 
were engaged in deadly clashes with police near the Interior Ministry 
headquarters in Cairo that killed 42 people less than three months 
before the soccer melee in Port Said.
