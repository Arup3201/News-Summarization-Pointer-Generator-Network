After a weekend of sunshine and high temperatures, the UK's beaches were all but deserted again today as parts of the country were warned to batten down the hatches with winds of up to 65mph set to batter Britain.

The Met Office has issued weather warnings for much of southern England and Wales tomorrow with the most blustery weather expected in coastal areas.

Forecasters have warned that transport could be disrupted as a result along with possible damage to trees.

Blustery: Kite surfers enjoy the windy weather and roughs seas at Tynemouth Beach today

Making the most of the weather: The surfers have more wet and windy weather to look forward to with the outlook not particular pleasant for the rest of the week

Flying: A kite surfer is blown above the sea in Tynemouth earlier today

Surf's up: The windy weather was in stark contrast to the bank holiday weekend when conditions were less than suitable for kite surfing

The turn for the worse weather wise 
comes after the UK enjoyed its hottest day of the year so far on Monday 
with temperatures hitting 24C in Crosby, Merseyside.

But the mercury will have dropped at least 10C below that for the rest of the week, with sunshine replaced by showers and rain.

Brighton
beach was all but deserted this morning - a stark contrast to the bank 
holiday weekend when brilliant sunshine and soaring temperatures saw it 
thronged with sunseekers.

And
the conditions overnight saw a yachtsman taking part in the Solent 650 
Solo race between the Isle of Wight and Plymouth run aground on Bovisand
bay in Plymouth.

The French yachtsman was unable to control the 21ft vessel called Diaoulici which was stranded on the beach this morning.

The boat was not reported to be badly damaged and is lying on the sand.However, a coastguard spokesman said they are unsure if an operation to get the yacht out of the water will be successful.

Deserted: Brighton beach, which was packed full of sunseekers over the bank holiday weekend, was empty today as the weather took a turn for the worse

Contrast: Tynemouth beach in the north east was also packed at the weekend, but the golden sands were deserted aside from a handful of dog walkers today

Room to manouvre: A vehicle has plenty of space to drive along Tynemouth beach today - and the beach looks likely to be deserted over the next few days with wind and rain forecast for much of the country

He said: 'There are strong winds in force and so I don’t know what is going to happen to the boat.

'The conditions will make it difficult for any salvage operation. 

'If we send a boat out to help, it could get into trouble itself.'

But the high winds weren't bad news for everyone.

While the beach's golden sands were 
deserted, kite surfers enjoyed rough seas and blustery conditions in 
Tynemouth today as the weather began to take a turn for the worse.

Tomorrow
will see the weather become wet, windy and unsettled according to Met 
Office forecasters, with strong winds particularly in the south west and
southern Wales.

Safety first: These lifeguards were the only people to be seen on a deserted Bournemouth beach today

Overcast: Dark clouds over Bournemouth beach today looked ominous as more rain and wind was forecast for the remainder of the week

Blaze: Fire spreading on the moors above Ripponden, West Yorkshire, on Wednesday. The dry ground and strong winds has enabled the fire, which has been burning since Saturday to spread

Flames: Firefighters attempt to tackle the blaze on the moors in West Yorkshire earlier today

Batten down the hatches: A severe weather warning is in place for part of the UK tomorrow

Gusts will reach around 65mph on the coast and around 50mph inland with temperatures look set to peak at around 15C.

Yellow warnings have been put in place from around 9am tomorrow with an area of low pressure sweeping across from the west of Ireland to blame.

A Met Office forecaster said: 'We're expecting strong winds for this time of year, but certainly nothing unprecedented.

'With trees starting to blossom that means they are susceptible to branches breaking off in the wind in some areas.

'But thankfully because we've had a late spring the damage will not be as bad as it could be.'

Friday will still be windy but gusts will have significantly died down with showers and plenty of cloud forecast for much of the UK.

According to the Met Office, Saturday will be a fairly similar day, fairly breezy again with a few light showers.

Rain could be more persistent in some areas.

Heavy weather has meant that a 60ft section of cliff has been cordoned off following the latest landslide to hit Britain’s south coast.

A huge crack has appeared along a section of coastline after the latest in a series of rockfalls along 50ft cliffs at Barton on Sea in Hampshire.

Dog walkers raised the alarm after the giant crack opened up above a row of prized beach huts following months of prolonged heavy weather.

It comes just days after a huge rockfall at Dorset beauty spot Durdle Door sent hundreds of thousands of tonnes of chalk crashing down onto the beach below.

The incident sparked warnings to walkers to stay clear of the crumbling coastline for fear of repeat rockfalls.

John Yeoman, a dog walker from nearby New Milton, said: 'I’ve been watching that crack develop for a year now, and it has definitely got worse over the last few days.

Stranded: Blustery weather caused this 21ft vessel to run aground in Plymouth overnight

Tough conditions: A French yachtsman believed to be taking part in the Solent 650 solo sailor race from Isle of Wight to Plymouth became grounded in Plymouth

'I dare say that bit will collapse all the way one of these days but it is taking its time.

'There have been a lot of little falls here since January, although nothing too serious.

'But I understand nothing is going to be done to protect the cliffs, so nature will just take its course.

'They say it will be about 50 years before it is cut back enough to reach the houses.'

Meriel Tandy, a resident of Barton on Sea for 56 years, added: 'It is sad to have lived here all these years and watch the cliff falling into the sea.'

The slip follows a more substantial slide in February further west which has left part of a nearby car park cordoned off.

Cordoned off: Heavy weather has meant that a stretch of land is in danger of slipping on the coast in Hampshire

No go zone: Walkers have been warned to stay away from the stretch of coast near Barton on Sea in Hampshire

Precarious: The crack looks as if it might take a section of this homeowner's garden with it should it slip into the sea

The inclement weather didn't put a dampener on a celebration to mark the end of winter and beginning of spring however.

Dancers turned out in their hundreds for the Helston Flora Dance in Cornwall.

The day, which is steeped in tradition, sees a variety of dances take place across the town from 7am into the night.

But the highlight is the midday dance which was traditionally the dance of the gentry and still sees the men wear top hats and the women dresses to take part.

A fire which broke out on the moors at Ripponden in West Yorkshire on Saturday continued to burn today as the flames were fanned by the weekend's dry weather and high winds.

Welcoming spring: A reveller at the Helston Flora dance in Cornwall blows his horn

Dancing the day away: Dances take place from 7am until well into the evening in Helston and many of the women taking part wear their finest dresses

Take your partner by the hand: Smartly dressed dancers take part in the Early Morning Dance in Helston today

Looking dapper: The midday dance was once known as the dance of the gentry which is why men still wear top hats to take part
