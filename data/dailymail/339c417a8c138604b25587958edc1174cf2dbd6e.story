Three teenager soccer players and two girls were killed when the car they were being driven back from a theme park veered off the freeway and caught fire.

Alex Sotelo, Matthew Melo and Brandon Moreno, who were all aged 14-15, died when their white BMW crashed on the I-5 freeway in Irvine, California at 2am Saturday.

Two teenage girls, who have not been named, were also killed when the car hit a guardrail, rolled off an embankment then caught fire.

Firefighters in California found six dead teenagers inside this car after it drove off the road. A sixth passenger, a 16-year-old boy, was transported to a nearby hospital in serious condition

A 16-year-old male, who was driving the car back from Knott's Scary Farm, a theme park event in nearby Buena Park, was found with severe head injuries 50 yards from the embankment where the car came to a rest.

The vehicle caught fire as it crashed, burning the bodies inside so badly that they will only be identifiable from dental records, NBC Los Angeles reported.

It also started a small brush fire, which emergency services extinguished. The injured boy has been taken to hospital and is in a critical condition.

The three male victims, from Mission Viejo, were identified by their soccer coach, who realized something had gone wrong when they failed to turn up for Saturday morning's game.

Billy McNicoll told how Alex, his team's top goal-scorer, and Matt were well-established players, while Brandon was a newer addition. Their loss hit the team hard.

Speaking to the LA Times, he said: 'These are good boys. We are devastated. Just devastated.'

Alex and Matthew were ninth-graders at Capistrano Valley High School in Mission Viejo, while Brandon was in the eighth grade at Carl Hankey Middle School in the same town.

The driver, who has also yet to be identified, lost control of the car as it was headed south, back towards Mission Viejo.

Under Californian law, drivers younger than 17-and-a-half are not allowed on the road between 11pm and 5am, or to carry passengers under 20.

Investigators are still looking in to what exactly may have caused the crash. It has been suggested that speed was a factor.
