Sheffield Eagles will be back in the steel city for their Ladbrokes Challenge Cup fifth-round tie with Hull FC.

The match, on Sunday 19 April, will be played at one of the Eagles' former homes, Bramall Lane.

The Eagles left their temporary home at Owlerton Stadium at the end of last season and currently are ground-sharing with Kingstone Press Championship rivals Doncaster at the Keepmoat Stadium until their new stadium on the site of the old Don Valley Stadium is completed.
