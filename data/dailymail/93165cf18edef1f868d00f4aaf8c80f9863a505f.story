These 17 dangerous men wanted abroad for crimes ranging from murder to human trafficking were today revealed to be on the run from British police.

The Metropolitan Police has launched a huge manhunt for the foreign nationals who are wanted by authorities across Europe and are now believed to be hiding in the UK.

One of the men battered his victim to death with a baseball bat in Romania, while another is being sought in connection with the murder of a woman who had her throat cut in Belgium.

Among the seven: One of the men, Silviu-Bogdan Bruzlea (left), 27, was sentenced to 20 years in prison in his absence for murdering a man in Romania in September 2007. Bangladeshi national Rouf Uddin (right), 39, is wanted by Belgian authorities following the murder of Malika Soussi in November 2002

Wanted: Alexandru Cucu (left) was being hunted by Romanian authorities after he and another suspect beat a security guard with an iron rod, a metal pipe and an axe handle. And detectives investigating the organised sexual exploitation of girls in Romania want to speak to Balint Budi (right)

The probe - named Operation Sunfire – is being run by Scotland Yard’s extradition unit. The majority of the men have links to London but their exact whereabouts are unknown.

Police issued photos of all 17 men as they launched the appeal today. Detective Sergeant Peter Rance, who is heading the manhunt, asked people to get in touch if they recognise any of them.

He said: ‘We believe that these people are dangerous, so taking them out of our communities and putting them before the courts is of paramount importance.

‘I urge the public to look closely at these pictures. Do you recognise these men? It may be that they live next door to you, or you see them regularly elsewhere in your community.’

One of the men, Silviu-Bogdan Bruzlea, 27, was sentenced to 20 years in prison in his absence for murdering a man in Romania in September 2007. 

After the victim and Bruzlea's girlfriend had an argument in the Tiga nightclub in Hunedoara, the killer armed himself with a baseball bat as he and his friends followed the victim home.

They then repeatedly hit the victim's head and body for ten minutes, causing injuries which he died from three days later in hospital.

Bangladeshi national Rouf Uddin, 39, is wanted by Belgian authorities following the murder of Malika Soussi in November 2002. 

The 32-year-old's body was found with her throat cut in her flat in Ïxelles.

Alexandru Cucu was being hunted by Romanian authorities after he and another suspect beat a security guard with an iron rod, a metal pipe and an axe handle at the Wake Up club in Cugir in April 2011.

The 27-year-old Romanian national was due to spend four and a half years in prison for attempted murder.

Janusz Kedziora, also known by the name Michal Krawczyk, is due to spend ten years in prison for a string of violent robberies in Poland.

In one incident the victim's teeth were broken when being robbed of beer, while in another a man was attacked with tear gas.

Yet to serve their sentences: Polish authorities want to extradite Michal Ochecki (left), 29, to serve a sentence of almost two-and-a-half years for robbery and assault, and Tomasz Pieta (right), 31, to spend more than three-and-a-half years behind bars for robbery, assaulting a police officer and criminal damage

The hunt is on: Abri Bucpapaj, 35, is wanted by Finnish authorities in connection with allegations of rape, assault and threats to kill

Polish authorities also want to extradite Michal Ochecki, 29, to serve a sentence of almost two-and-a-half years for robbery and assault, and Tomasz Pieta, 31, to spend more than three-and-a-half years behind bars for robbery, assaulting a police officer and criminal damage.

Abri Bucpapaj, 35, is wanted by Finnish authorities in connection with allegations of rape, assault and threats to kill.

Mr Rance said: ‘The Met is committed to arresting dangerous criminals - whether they are British or foreign nationals.

‘We conduct extensive enquiries on a daily basis, however, experience tells us that co-ordinated operations such as Sunfire encourage the public to provide us with the information that often leads to arrests.’

This is the fourth time the Met has run Operation Sunfire, with almost half of those wanted in previous appeals subsequently arrested.

Lord Ashcroft, founder and chairman of Crimestoppers, said: ‘Crimestoppers works hard to keep communities safe, which is why we are calling on anyone who might recognise these individuals to contact us completely anonymously and let us know their whereabouts.

‘Many of these individuals are known to be highly dangerous, making their arrest an urgent priority.’
