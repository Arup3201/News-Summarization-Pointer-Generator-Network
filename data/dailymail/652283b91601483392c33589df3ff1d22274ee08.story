Stars from the worlds of sports and showbiz turned out in force to watch the fifth regular season NBA contest staged in London when the struggling New York Knicks came up against the Milwaukee Bucks at the sold-out O2 Arena.

Around 60 Premier League players were believed to be in on the guest list, although few are likely to have had better views than those shared by Arsenal legend Thierry Henry and Chelsea team-mates Cesc Fagregas and Didier Drogba from their courtside seats. Gunners midfielder Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain did, however, get close to a couple of Knicks cheerleaders for a glamourous photo taken backstage.

Henry, who could have picked up his affection for basketball while playing in the MLS for New York Red Bulls, was given a standing ovation when his image was flashed up on the big screen ahead of the game. Other sports stars at the event included former England striker Michael Owen, the England rugby union team's No 8, Billy Vunipola, and British heavyweight boxing sensation Anthony Joshua.

There was also interest from celebrities ranging from Hollywood actors, including Idris Elba and Tara Reid, to popstars Little Mix and Liam Payne from boy band One Direction.

On court, the Knicks could not halt their dismal run of 15 straight defeats and, despite a late fightback, were defeated 95-79 by the Bucks in front of a sell-out 18,500 crowd in the capital.

Even the return of the Knicks' star player Carmelo Anthony could not prevent them from ending their dismal losing steak

The 27-year-old guard was one of five Milwaukee players in double figures as they cruised past the Knicks.

Brandon Knight also had 20 points, while Giannis Antetokounmpo (16), Khris Middleton (14) and Zaza Pachulia (11) also reached double figures in another impressive team performance by Jason Kidd’s side.

The defeat for the Knicks was their 16th in a row and 26th in their last 27 matches. It was also a third straight loss against the Bucks this season.

‘It’s not good enough and we have to get better,’ New York Knicks head coach said. ‘We have to work harder than what we are and put more time and effort in to get the results that we want.

‘We have played against this team four times including pre-season and they’re just better than us.’

Thursday night’s game was the fifth regular-season contest to be staged at the arena in south London since 2011, and one of the most one-sided.

Two years is a very long time in basketball. In January 2013, the Knicks came to London and brushed aside a Detroit Pistons side 102-87 on their way to finishing second behind the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference.

This team is not even a shadow of that side, and they return home with their league-worst record at a dire 5-36 with their next win seemingly a world away.

Even the return of Anthony from injury couldn’t keep things close against a young, dynamic Bucks side that moved to 21-19 for the season and remained well and truly on course for a play-off spot in the Eastern Conference.

London fans will at least be happy that Anthony was on the court after making the long trip over having missed the previous six games with a knee injury.

Anthony played 27 minutes and scored 25 points, but they were all in vain for the London 2012 Olympic basketball gold medallist.
