Every parent knows that sleep is a precious and rare commodity, and now one couple have come up with a unique way of ensuring they enough in the morning.

Pasco, Washington, native Samantha Manville and her husband told ABC News that one night when they found themselves awake at 2am, they decided to write a note for their children to read in the morning, telling them not to wake them unless it was a 'real emergency'.

In the letter, the couple listed the things ten-year-old Alexia and Liam, eight, were allowed and not allowed to do the hope that they wouldn't disturb them for any reason.

Catching up on sleep: Samantha Manville and her husband came up with a unique way of ensuring they were able to sleep in: a note to their kids with the answers to things they might want to ask

Success: And their efforts paid off. 'It was a one-time thing and we got away with it,' said the mother-of-two before adding: 'But if the kids start to see it all the time they'll just start to ignore it'

And their efforts paid off. 'It was a one-time thing and we got away with it,' said the mother-of-two before adding: 'But if the kids start to see it all the time they'll just start to ignore it.'

The colorful note starts out optimistically with the words 'Morning, Kids!' written out in green block letters.

The next line reads: 'Mom and Dad are sleeping in this morning! DO NOT knock and wake us up before 10am unless there is a real EMERGENCY!!'

Ms Manville explained that she and her husband wanted to cover all bases in the letter so Liam and Alexia would have no reason to wake them.

'We brainstormed trying to figure out what questions would they have,' she said. 'What would make them knock on the door?'

Warnings: To ten-year-old Alexia, they write: 'Don't antagonize your brother', while eight-year-old Liam's personal note reads: 'Don't be a whiner... or at least not a loud one!'

Thinking ahead: 'We brainstormed trying to figure out what questions would they have,' said Ms Manville. 'What would make them knock on the door?'

Their list begins: 'You can have cereal for breakfast. Yes, you can watch TV/play Wii. No, you may not go to your friends' house'.

They prohibit their children from eating 'baggies of snacks' but write that they can have 'an orange for a snack. This means one each!'

To Alexia, they write specifically: 'Don't antagonize your brother', while Liam's personal note reads: 'Don't be a whiner... or at least not a loud one!'

Thankfully for the couple, their kids got the hint and they were able to sleep in peace. 'I looked at the clock when I woke up and it was 10:06,' said Ms Manville. 'We made it.'
