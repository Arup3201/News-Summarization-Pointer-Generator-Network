Sam Allardyce questioned West Ham’s ambition as he reacted to Sportsmail’s revelations that he is about to be sacked.

Allardyce is set to go after the club’s final Premier League clash against Manchester City, but he hit back by querying whether West Ham were still the club to match his ambition as a manager.

The 59-year-old said: ‘I have more ambition than West Ham ever have. I have more ambition than them, or the same ambition as them.

Pointing it out: Sam Allardyce says he has more ambition that West Ham ever have

‘I want to get into Europe. I want to 
get into the new stadium. I want to win a cup. If I don’t have ambition I
 don’t do this job.

‘If I 
don’t have drive, or motivation, I don’t do this job. I am ambitious. I 
have seen it all before and you use your experience to try to achieve 
that ambition. Can West Ham match my ambition? Eventually, yes. It is 
whether everyone is patient enough to wait to get there. That is the 
problem today: a lack of patience across the board.’

Allardyce
 said he had spoken to joint owner David Sullivan on Thursday about 
arranging a meeting to discuss next season’s plans and was given ‘no 
indication his position was under threat’.

He
 defended his record in keeping the club in the top flight for a second 
consecutive season and said West Ham played ‘terrific football’. But, 
when asked whether he was still the man to lead the Hammers into their 
new home at the Olympic Stadium, Allardyce admitted the realistic answer
 was ‘no’.

He said: ‘As the average life of a manager is 13 months you would have to say “no”, being realistic.

‘We’ve
 had more (managerial) changes in the Premier League than ever before 
and one never knows when it’s going to happen to you. You have to do the
 best with the resources you’ve got. This club was in the Championship 
when I came here and I have delivered what I have been asked to deliver.
 I did what Gus Poyet did at Sunderland, but six or seven weeks ago. So 
if I had done it now instead of then would everyone be singing my 
praises? Probably yes.’

West
 Ham can finish no higher than 12th, but Allardyce pledged his team 
would ‘try to spoil Manchester City’s party’ by pulling off an unlikely 
win at the Etihad that could deny Manuel Pellegrini’s side the Premier 
League title.

West Ham have 
suffered a 12-1 aggregate scoreline against City in three league and 
Capital One Cup matches this season, but Allardyce insisted a fully fit 
Hammers team are still capable of causing an upset. He added it is 
striker Andy Carroll’s last chance to impress England boss Roy Hodgson, 
who names his World Cup squad on Monday.

Allardyce
 said: ‘Every player can go and give his best because we know we’re safe
 in the Premier League, so let’s go and spoil Manchester City’s party.

‘Andy
 is full of energy. He has not had a long arduous season like some 
players have had. He is ready to go. A big performance against 
Manchester City could maybe tip Roy’s mind — who knows?’
