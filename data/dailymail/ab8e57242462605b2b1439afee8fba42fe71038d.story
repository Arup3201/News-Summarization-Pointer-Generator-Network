Too soon: St Louis Cardinals outfielder Oscar Taveras died Sunday in a car accident in his native Dominican Republic

Less than a year after making his Major League Baseball debut, St Louis Cardinals outfielder Oscar Taveras has died in a car crash.

The 22-year-old slugger's death was confirmed by his agent and newspapers in his native Dominican Republic, after he was involved in a traffic accident there on Sunday. 

His girlfriend, identified as 18-year-old Edilia Arvelo, was also reportedly in the 2014 Chevy Camaro when it crashed and died as well.  

'He wasn't carrying documents at the time of the accident, but his body was identified by family members,' Col. Diego Pesqueira of the Metropolitan Transportation Agency said of Taveras.

National police spokesman Jacobo Mateo Moquete said he was told by the mayor of Sosua that Taveras lost control of his vehicle and went off the road. 

It was reported that he died while driving on a stretch of road between the towns of Cabarete and Sosua.

'I simply can't believe it,' Cardinals general manager John Mozeliak said in a release. 'I first met Oscar when he was 16 years old and will forever remember him as a wonderful young man who was a gifted athlete with an infectious love for life who lived every day to the fullest.'

Cardinals chairman Bill DeWitt Jr. said the organization was 'stunned and deeply saddened' by Taveras' death.

'Oscar was an amazing talent with a bright future who was taken from us well before his time,' DeWitt said. 'Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends tonight.' 

'All of us throughout Major League Baseball are in mourning this evening,' baseball Commissioner Bud Selig said in a release.

'Oscar, a young member of the baseball family, was full of promise and at the dawn of a wonderful career in our game, evident in his game-tying home run against the Giants exactly two weeks ago.' 

Several of Taveras' Cardinals teammates have started mourning his loss on Twitter.

'Absolute tragedy,' teammate Matt Carpenter tweeted after hearing the news. 'My prayers go out to Oscar [Taveras'] family.' 

'We mourn the passing of Cardinals outfielder Oscar Taveras,' the MLB also tweeted.  

Taveras was signed to the Cardinals as a free agent in 2008. He made his major league with the Cardinals this past season, after being ranked the third top prospect by Baseball America. 

The magazine also called him an 'all-star in the making'. 

He appeared in 80 regular season games and seven post-season games, and hit a game-tying home run in a championship game against the San Francisco Giants two weeks ago.  

'Obviously, we have deep condolences to his family. We are still waiting for more details before issuing a full statement,' Cardinals GM John Mozeliak said Sunday evening.
