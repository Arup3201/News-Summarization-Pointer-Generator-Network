John Howard has warned Tony Abbott that the biggest threat to him remaining Prime Minister at the next election emanates not from within but from being 'foolish enough' to disrespect and underestimate the man sitting on the opposite side of the house, Bill Shorten.

Talk in political circles has increasingly focused on the growing popularity and leadership qualities of Foreign Minister Julie Bishop, notwithstanding the continued steady support of Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull, and the flagging public backing for the PM.

John Howard, Australia's second longest serving Prime Minister, was discussing his new book 'The Menzies Era' (about the country's longest serving PM, Sir Robert Menzies) with Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday and had this advice for the incumbent: 'Any Opposition leader should be taken seriously. That’s my view, anybody in government who is foolish enough to dismiss an opposition leader will often pay a very heavy price.'

John Howard's most respected Labor Prime Minister was Bob Hawke. When asked, he unhesitatingly nominated Mr Hawke saying 'I would put him ahead of all the others' 

'The Labor Party ridiculed Tony Abbott when he became Opposition Leader, they said he was unelectable, they said he was this, that and the other, he won and he proved them wrong,' Mr Howard said.

'My advice to the Liberal Party is treat your opponent with both caution and respect.'

While he rated the man who followed him as Coalition PM an 'eight out of 10' for his first year in the top job, Mr Howard added: 'I think he is experiencing what so many Prime Ministers do in their early years, he’s had his setbacks, he’s got a difficult Senate but he has achieved a lot of his major commitments and I think he’ll be able to ride through the adversity'.

'That’ll be a test of him, like every prime minister, he’ll be tested by events and judged accordingly but my assessment of his personality and intelligence is that he’ll handle those events effectively.

'Every Prime Minister has difficulties in the early years, I did, Menzies did, there’s a common and erroneous belief about Menzies that once he was elected in 1949 he just governed without hindrance for 16 years – that wasn’t the case. He had a very up and down time.

'There’s nothing unusual about a prime minister having some choppy weather in his early years. In fact, prime ministers have choppy weather through most of their years, unless their opponents are split badly and become unelectable.' 

Mr Howard's follow-up book to the best-selling 'Lazarus Rising' charts the history of Australia under the leadership of Menzies, whose first foray as PM actually ended in tears; when 'he suffered the ignominy of losing the prime ministership, something that most people saw as the end of his political career'.

But he returned, in triumph, to not only form the Liberal Party of Australia but to go on and govern for another 16 years, between 1949 and 1966.

As for the widely publicised Jacqui Lambie breakway from the Palmer United Party this past week and the general rise of minor parties, Mr Howard said the political landscape had changed and, it is a challenge for the major parties to come to terms with it.

'It is a question of whether it is a good thing or a bad thing in the sense that it’s what the people want and from time to time people will express their dissatisfaction with the two major parties by voting for smaller parties and that’s the democratic process,' he said.

'You don’t try and react to it by thinking you can change the rules to stop it happening, you won’t achieve that and you shouldn’t try to.

'What you should do is try and address the reasons why people are disenchanted with the 2 major parties and that’s a responsibility of my party and obviously a responsibility for the Labor Party.'

But he's equally sure there is no real need for a third major party, as Australia once boasted. 

'I think you need a strong two-party system and I think the nature of modern politics is that fewer people are rusted on to the respective sides of politics and you have what I called detachable flanks of 10 to 15 per cent of voters on either side who go off at various stages,' Mr Howard added.

'I don’t think you will see a third party emerging which is the equal of either the Labor Party or the Coalition but you will for some time, for the foreseeable future you will have this detachment on the two sides of politics.

'When I was first involved in politics there was a 40/40/20 rule that 40 per cent were always Coalition, 40 per cent were always Labor and 20 per cent in the middle.

'One sometimes feels now that it’s 30/30/40, that there are a lot more people prone to change between elections, there are fewer people who are rusted on to either side of politics and that will produce the phenomena that we now have, if it’s not the Palmer United Party it will be something else in the future, it’s just a feature of Australian politics now.

'I don’t think it will lead to a formation of a party which is the equal of or even a serious rival to the Labor Party or the Coalition.' 

'The Menzies Era' charts the 23 year period from 1949 to 1972 when the Coalition held office in Australia, winning seven elections in a row with Sir Robert taking the lead for much of that period

While he warned the Coalition against underestimating those on the other side of the chamber, Mr Howard agreed there are parallels between the ALP which Menzies confronted and what has occurred within the Labor Party in recent years.

'There’s no doubt that he (Menzies) benefited enormously from the Labor Party split and the Labor Party was unelectable for a full decade, literally unelectable, they were in terrible shape,' Mr Howard said.

'He was very fortunate in that sense and the Labor Party was a better disciplined organisation in the 80s and 90s and onwards than what it was in the 1950s.

'It’s certainly been a shambles quite recently but not as cataclysmic as the split, the split in the 1950s caused enormous bitterness that lasted for a generation.'

But he did have kind words for one Labor leader, unhesitatingly nominating Bob Hawke as the ALP Prime Minister he most respected.

'Hawke. I think he was more successful as a Labor Prime Minister than any of the others. The Labor Prime Ministers I dealt with ... I came in when Whitlam was PM and then Hawke and Keating, then Rudd and Gillard and Rudd again, so I would put him ahead of the others,' Mr Howard said. 

The former PM also backed Tony Abbott's so-called shirt-front tactics against Russian president Vladimir Putin over the MH17 tragedy, claiming 'I think Abbott’s rhetoric is quite justified'. 

Mr Howard, the nation's 25th PM, spent the best part of two and a half years in the labour of love which was researching and writing of the Menzies era.

For now though, he says, he'll focus on promoting his latest works, while keeping a close eye on his beloved Australian cricket eleven trying to score more success over the summer. Another piece of prose, however, may not be too far away.

He concluded by comparing being interviewed as an author to being grilled as a politician.

'There are similarities in both. You are asked to recall what you have written in one iteration and you are asked to recall what you have said in another,' Mr Howard said.
