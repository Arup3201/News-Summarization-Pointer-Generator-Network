Dr Chris Simpkins, director general of the Legion, said: 'Each year the Festival of Remembrance honours those who have made the ultimate sacrifice and all those who serve. 

'This year is especially poignant in the centenary of the start of the First World War.

'For a live and televised audience the festival will honour the memory of the fallen and the future of the living.'

The Legion was founded in 1921 by veterans of the First World War who adopted the poppy as their symbol. 

Over the past two weeks, the Legion's national Poppy Appeal has seen some 45 million poppies distributed by 350,000 collectors with the aim of raising £40 million.

Viewers at home can tune in to coverage presented by Huw Edwards on BBC1 from 9.15pm-10.50pm. The festival is also being broadcast on BBC Radio 2.
