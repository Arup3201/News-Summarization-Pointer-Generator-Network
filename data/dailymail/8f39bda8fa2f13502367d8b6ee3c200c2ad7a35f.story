Former X Factor judge Tulisa Contostavlos has denied punching a TOWIE star, claiming she remained calm during a confrontation in which he insulted her mentally ill mother, a court has heard.

Contostavlos, 26, is currently attempting to overturn a conviction for assaulting Savvas Morgan - who posted a link to a sex tape of her on his website - at Snaresbrook Crown Court.

The singer was convicted last summer of punching Mr Morgan in the face at the August 2013 V Festival.

According to Mr Morgan, Contostavlos had a grudge against him since he published a link to a sex tape leaked by her ex-boyfriend rapper Justin Edwards in 2012.

But today Contostavlos insisted she remained calm during the ‘kerfaffle’ while Mr Morgan labelled her a ‘b****’ and a ‘s***.’

Contostavlos said she asked Mr Morgan 'diplomatically' to stop following her 15-strong entourage as they headed towards her Winnebago at the festival for a party.

Mr Morgan was a celebrity blogger and was trying to talk to former Sugababe Mutya Buena, a friend of Contostavlos.

Contostavlos said she pointed out to Mr Morgan he was not invited.

‘I became aware of Vas (Mr Morgan) because he came and spoke to Mutya. We had been standing next to each other walking,’ she said.

‘I think I made a bit of space between us and after the conversation I warned her off from him, saying he sold people stories about celebrities.

‘We were going back to the Winnebago and, because the festival was finished [for the night,] I hoped he was leaving.

‘He continued to follow us to the opening of the Winnebago area. The people going into that area were only going there for one reason; to come back to mine. There was nowhere else he could have been going.

‘I turned around and said something along the lines of “right stop, turn around, you are not following me”.'

Contostavlos denied storming up to Mr Morgan aggressively, explaining she only needed to turn around to confront him.

She said she told him to ‘go away in a ‘calm’ and ‘diplomatic’ manner.

‘I was calm and relaxed until his instant reaction, which was aggressive. I didn’t want to get into an argument or confrontation, she said.

Contostavlos told the court Mr Morgan became aggressive, moving towards her and using abusive language.

He called her a ‘s***,’ ‘w****,’ ‘a nobody’ and went on to insult her mentally ill mother, it was said.

Contostavlos admitted using terms such as ‘b******’ and ‘d***head,’ but said she kept her hands behind her back during the incident.

The scuffle, which lasted around four minutes, escalated when Contostavlos’ personal assistant Gareth Varey confronted Mr Morgan.

Eventually Contostavlos was led away by her tour manager towards the Winnebago as the argument continued.

Mr Morgan was left with a swollen eye after the incident.

Contostavlos claimed it was out of character for her to argue and was adamant she did not become violent.

She described herself as a ‘fighter’ - but only emotionally.

Contostavlos claimed Mr Morgan once turned up outside her hotel room in Los Angeles and also appeared unexpectedly to her 23rd birthday party.

She was convicted of punching Mr Morgan at V Festival on 25 July 2014, leaving him with ‘swelling’ for the next 48 hours.

Gareth Varey, Contostavlos's assistant, who was a dancer on a 2010 N-Dubz tour, told how he ran over to Mr Morgan when he saw him 'towering over' the singer.

'They [Contostavlos and Mr Morgan] were in a heated argument and I heard her saying: "Stop following me."

'They were face-to-face, but what made me panic was how Vas was towering over her. People started walking towards them both as the voices raised in volume. I ran over but slipped because it had been raining - by this time he was screaming all sorts of things at her.'

Mr Morgan called Contostavlos a 's***,' a 's***' and mentioned her sex tape, Mr Varey claimed.

'He was referencing various ludicrous claims about her financial situation, and even said he would ruin her,' Mr Varey added. 'He said this aggressively and loudly, it was very heated.

'It was a war of words.'

Mr Varey insisted that neither he nor Contostavlos had hit Mr Morgan.

He continued: 'Tulisa and I are mature enough to have an argument and not hit somebody, he claimed. Everybody has their day-to-day arguments without launching themselves at someone.'

Contostavlos claims Mr Morgan had only become famous off the back of the animosity between the two and added it was the only reason he got a job on ITV3’s reality TV show The Only Way Is Essex.

Following her conviction, the singer was was fined £200, and ordered to pay £100 compensation and a £20 victim surcharge, as well as £2,700 towards prosecution costs.

Contostavlos, from Friern Barnet, north London, is appealing one count of assault.

The hearing continues.
