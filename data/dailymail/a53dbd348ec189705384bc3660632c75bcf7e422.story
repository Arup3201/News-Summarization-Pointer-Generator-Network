Meet Chloe – a baby wombat who is Sydney Taronga Zoo’s newest addition to the family.

Zookeeper Evelyn Weston has taken on the role of surrogate mother to an orphaned wombat after her mother was hit by a car and killed.

The six-month-old joey was found in her dead mother’s pouch on a road near Jenolan Caves, west of the Blue Mountains, in New South Wales in June.

But the fury little creature has been receiving round-the-clock care and keeping everyone busy while melting hearts among the Zoo's keepers.

‘My biggest problem is getting her back [from the keepers],’ joked Ms Weston. 

As part of her 'motherly duties', Ms Weston carries Chloe in a makeshift pouch around her waist and stops her job every five hours to bottle feed her.

Chloe was brought to Taronga Wildlife Hospital last week for ongoing care and the keepers hope she will be strong enough to return to the wild in about 18 months. 

‘She’s very affectionate and also a bit naughty. She loves chewing on shoes and if you walk away from her she chases after you like a rocket.’

For now, Chloe's diet is limited to a special milk mixture but  she will gradually be introduced to solid foods within a month.

‘We did try to see if she’d nibble on a bit of grass, but she just thought it was something to lie on,’ Ms Evelyn said.

Ms Weston's will care baby Chloe for at least another two months, before she moves to a temporary new home at Taronga's Australian  Walkabout.

Ms Weston has paid tribute to the great work of wildlife carers and said Chloe’s story should serve as a reminder to motorists to watch out for wildlife on the roads.

Taronga Wildlife Hospital cares for and treats over 1,000 injured or orphaned native animals every year, including wombats, wallabies, possums, echidnas, birds and sea turtles.
