A leading Libyan human rights lawyer was gunned down inside her own home shortly after she had cast her vote in national elections.

Salwa Bugaighis was murdered on Wednesday evening after gunmen burst into her compound in Benghazi  and shot her in the head.

Libyan state media reported that Ms Bugaighis was rushed to hospital but died of her wounds.

Gunmen burst into Salwa Bugaighis' home in Benghazi and shot her in the head a short while after she had cast her vote in the Libyan parliamentary election. Islamic extremists are believed to have been behind the attack

The human rights activist and lawyer 
was leading voice following the 2011 uprising, opposing armed militias 
and radical Islamic extremists, who have grown in strength since Colonel
 Gadhafi's fall.

Libyan
 security forces have not yet identified the gunmen, but the country is 
being hit by a wave of assassinations targeting secular activists, 
judges, moderate clerics, policemen and soldiers.

Islamic extremists are understood to be behind many of these attacks.

Hours before her murder, Ms Bugaighis had been speaking to Libyan TV Al-Nabaa network channel about a heavy gunfight in her neighbourhood.

It is believed that militants tried to ambush government troops protecting a polling station.

She said: 'These are people who want to foil elections. Benghazi has been always defiant, and always will be despite the pain and fear. It will succeed.'

Hours before her murder, Ms Bugaighis urged voters, such as this woman, to cast their ballots in this week's parliamentary election despite the terror threat

The gunmen asked for Ms Bugaighis' son Wael before shooting a security guard in the leg. The killers broke into the house before shooting her in the head.

Ms Bugaighi's husband has not been seen since the attack.

The couple had returned to Benghazi from Libyan capital Tripoli to vote in the parliamentary elections.

Their children have been staying in Jordan after an earlier attempt to kidnap or murder them failed.

Ms Bugaighis has represented Libya abroad since the collapse of the Gadhafi regime. She worked tirelessly towards trying to reduce ethnic and religious tensions in the country.

Hassan al-Amin, another human rights activist who has fled Libya because of the constant death threats said: 'All supporters of the truth are threatened.'

On her Twitter page, US ambassador Deborah K Jones called her killing 'a cowardly, despicable, shameful act against a courageous woman and true Libyan patriot. Heartbreaking.'

Speaking just hours before her death, Ms Bugaighis said there was heavy fighting in her neighbourhood after rebels in a bid to disrupt the election  had attacked government troops  who were protecting a polling station

The U.N. mission in Libya condemned the assassination in a statement, saying "once again, Benghazi witnesses a bloody attack, the last of a series largely targeting civilians."

Libyans voted on Wednesday in the country's second parliament elections, hoping for stability after three years of chaos since Gadhafi's death.

On her Facebook page, Ms Bugaighis posted pictures for herself casting ballots in Benghazi.

Later, she gave the interview to Al-Nabaa TV as shelling hit her neighborhood and smoke rose from nearby. She urged people to go to the polls and cast ballots, saying she hoped for a new parliament without the current domination by Islamists.

'From your network,' she told the station, 'I call upon our people in Benghazi to steadfast and be patient because elections must be accomplished.'
