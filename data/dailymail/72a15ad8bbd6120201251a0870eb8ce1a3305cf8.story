CBS has quietly released an interview with Obama which was filmed one day after the attack on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi - and in which he refuses to call the incident an act of terrorism.

The footage, released seven weeks after it was filmed, shows Obama contradicting himself yet again on the attack that left the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans dead.

When exactly Obama called the September 11 al Qaeda attack in Libya 'terrorism' has become an increasingly contentious area of debate - and the interview throws doubt on the president's previous and later claims.

Details: In an interview on September 12, Obama would not confirm that the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi was an act of terrorism - despite his later claims. The interview was released this weekend

At the second presidential debate in October, Obama claimed he had first called the incident an act of terrorism during his Rose Garden speech just hours after the attack.

But the newly-released footage, filmed 12 hours after the Rose Garden appearance, shows he was still apprehensive about the label.

'Mr. President, this morning you 
went out of your way to avoid the use of the word terrorism in 
connection with the Libya Attack, do you believe that this was a 
terrorism attack?' interviewer Steve Kroft asked in the 60 Minutes interview.

'Well it's too early to tell exactly 
how this came about, what group was involved,' he responded. 'But obviously it was an 
attack on Americans. And we are going to be working with the Libyan 
government to make sure that we bring these folks to justice, one way or
 the other.'

Attack:The U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was set alight and four Americans were killed on September 11

Kroft continued: 'It's been described as a mob action, but 
there are reports that they were very heavily armed with grenades, that 
doesn’t sound like your normal demonstration.'

Obama responded: 'As I 
said, we're still investigating exactly what happened, I don’t want to 
jump the gun on this... And my suspicion is 
there are folks involved in this. Who were looking to target Americans 
from the start.'

The interview previously aired on October 19, but this section was edited out, Bret Baier reported on Fox. CBS only released this footage on Sunday - more than seven weeks after the interview.

The network even failed to offer it up when questions were raised during the presidential debate over whether he had called the attack terrorism before blaming it on rallies against an anti-Islamic film.

Butting heads: In the second presidential debate on October 16, Romney said it took Obama two weeks before he called the incident an act of terrorism, which Obama refuted

October 16 At Presidential Debate Obama said he stood in the Rose Garden the day after the attack 'and I told the American people in the world... that this was an act of terror'

Romney had argued in the debate: 'There were many days that passed before we knew whether this was a spontaneous demonstration or actually whether it was a terrorist attack.

'And there was no demonstration involved. It was a terrorist attack, and it took a long time for that to be told to the American people.'

Obama responded: 'The day after the attack, Governor, I stood in the Rose Garden, and I told the American people and the world that we are going to find out exactly what happened, that this was an act of terror.

'And the suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the secretary of state, our U.N. ambassador, anybody on my team would play politics or mislead when we've lost four of our own, Governor, is offensive. That's not what we do.'

Romney fact checked him, adding: 'It took the president 14 days before he called the attack in Benghazi an act of terror.'

In the debate, moderator Candy Crowley intervened on Obama's behalf, claiming he had called the attack an 
act of terror in his Rose Garden statement.

In the Rose Garden, Obama had said: 'No acts of terror will ever shake the resolve of this great nation, alter that character, or eclipse the light of the values that we stand for.'

While this shows Obama had referred to the attack as an act of terror in the Rose Garden, the latest CBS footage shows that Romney was correct about Obama's confusion and mixed messages to the public.

Questions now remain over why CBS originally released the edited clip that appeared to back up his claims in the debate, but left out the remainder of the interview.

U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens 
and three other U.S. citizens came under fire in the six-hour attack, 
for which al-Qaeda and Islamist militia Ansar al-Sharia have been 
blamed.

Loss: Tyrone Woods, left, and Information Management Officer Sean Smith, right, also died in the attack

It recently emerged that the U.S. government was told that the attack had been carried out by militants, not a spontaneous mob, within just 24 hours of its taking place.

A diplomatic cable sent the day after the raid suggested that militants had previously planned to attack the consulate, and used the excuse of protests against the anti-Muslim video as a cover.

It is unclear who, if anyone, saw the cable outside the CIA at that point and how high up in the agency the information went, yet the statement directly contradicts the explanation of the attack given by the administration over the following two weeks.
