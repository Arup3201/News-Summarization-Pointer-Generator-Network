A Texas girl who was just 11 when she was raped by 20 men over a three-month period in 2010 has revealed that she is now seven months pregnant at the age of 14.

Them teenager says the baby's father is her 15-year-old boyfriend and that they plan to keep the child.

The shocking crime gained national attention when police began investigating in December 2010, after the girl's classmate told a teacher he had seen cellphone video of men having sex with
her.

Expecting: The Cleveland, Texas gang rape victim is now 7 -months pregnant at age 14. The father is her 15-year-old boyfriend

Prosecutors say the girl was
sexually assaulted on at least five occasions by 20 men and boys in the
Southeast Texas town of Cleveland, about 45 miles northeast of Houston.

The girl was 11 during the assaults from mid-September through early December 2010.
Police began investigating that December, when cell phone video emerged of one assault.

After investigators learned of the horrific assault, the girl was moved to foster care but ran away from her group home in Beaumont, Texas in December 2011 and was the victim of another sexual assault while she was living on the streets.

In August 2012, she returned to Houston to be with her family. 

She now lives with her mother, brother and sisters.

Her mother, Maria, told KHOU-TV that she was upset when she learned the girl was pregnant.

'Well, when she came with the pregnancy test, I was like, "Go away, get away from me, I was upset,"' she said.

The mother says that she now realizes that this may just be part of her daughter's healing.

'I think it's pretty common that sometimes girls, when that happens to them, they try to find the comfort in someone else, like they want to feel loved.'

The victim, who has not been identified, said she feels nervous about the upcoming arrival of her child. She also said she hopes that people won't judge her for having a child out of wedlock.

Sentenced: Kelvin King (left) and Jared McPherson (right) also pleaded guilty to sexual assault charges in the shocking pare case. They must register as a sex offender once they are released from prison

Guilty: Eric McGowen, was convicted and sentenced in 2012 to 99 years in prison for the shocking crime

All six juveniles and six of the 14 adults charged pleaded guilty.

Others opted for trials.

The
girl described the series of horrendous attacks that took 
place in the small Texas community of Cleveland during the trial for Eric McGowen.

She testified that McGowen took her to a house in October 2010 where she had sex with multiple males. 

The girl said she was brought into 
what she described as the 'baby room' in the house, and that McGowen and
others took turns having sex with her.

Testifying under the pseudonym Regina, the girl smiled nervously and answered questions quietly.

But she began to cry when prosecutors began playing a graphic video tape of her having anal sex during one of the alleged attacks.

Crime scene: Authorities say this is the abandoned trailer where an 11-year-old girl was sexually assaulted in November 2010 in the town of Cleveland, Texas

Dirty: The attacks occurred inside an abandoned mobile home, pictured, where the victim was assaulted by as many as 20 men

She identified McGowen in the film laughing in the background, telling the attacker to 'beat that ho.'

She described another alleged rape in November 2010 that started in a different Cleveland home the defendants 
called the 'boom boom' room, according to prosecutors, and that 
continued later at a nearby abandoned trailer.

Jurors
were later shown police photos of used condoms and condom wrappers 
found inside and outside the house in the November incident.

During
opening statements, Warren told jurors he would present 
them with videotaped and written confessions in which McGowen admitted 
to raping the girl.

He was convicted and sentenced to 99 years in prison in 2012.

Defendant Jared Len Cruse also opted for a trial.

In November, he was convicted of aggravated sexual assault and was sentenced to life.
