An elementary school teacher from Florida was arrested after police say they discovered nude photos of her on a cell phone belonging to a 17-year-old boy.

Lesley Brown, 45, a married mother from Largo, Florida, was caught entering a unisex bathroom inside the Highland Recreation Center with a teenage boy Monday, according to police.

Witnesses said the pair stayed inside the restroom for 10 minutes behind a closed door, raising suspicions of inappropriate behavior.

Police officers who were called to the scene questioned Brown and the teen, who both told them the 17-year-old was acting as the woman's workout partner and spotter, the station Fox 13 reported.

Brown and her young companion insisted that nothing had happened between them in the bathroom, but Brown was issued a trespass warning by gym staffers. 

Later that night, however, investigators obtained naked pictures of the married elementary school teacher from the teenager's phone, as well as X-rated text messages from her.

Mrs Brown was taken into custody Tuesday and charged with felony transmission of material harmful to minors. She was released from jail this morning after posting $5,000 bond.

Lesley Brown has worked for the past six years as a fourth-grade reading and writing teacher at Fuguitt Elementary School in Largo.

Police have pointed out that Brown’s alleged offenses were unrelated to her work as an educator.
