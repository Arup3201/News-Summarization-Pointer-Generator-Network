If the NFL is really serious about getting London to embrace the American game, it may want to consider sending over the Cowboys Cheerleaders whether Dallas is playing at Wembley or not.

As American as apple pie, bourbon, Marilyn Monroe and Elvis, the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders have been an institution for decades and they are just as recognisable, if not more so, than their NFL team’s distinctive star logo.

After getting in early on Tuesday morning, the ladies have been busy promoting Sunday’s game at Wembley against the Jacksonville Jaguars, participating in community events, exploring London, and of course, finding time to practice.

With only a short amount of time to get a lot of things done, the team has been attempting to operate with the speed and efficiency of a two-minute drill in the fourth quarter.

‘We keep saying “You’re only in London once,” so that’s our new phrase for YOLO this week,’ two-year DCC member Jennifer Kathryne said. ‘We just keep telling ourselves we want to take in as much as we can. We’ve foregone a few extra-precious hours of sleep to go see Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey and do some shopping. We’ve definitely done our best to get out there and see the city.’

‘My favourite part about sightseeing was Parliament and going into the House of Commons,’ Angela Rena, a sports massage therapist who hails from Australia, said. ‘We witnessed a debate going on about England and Iran. That was an experience we wouldn’t have otherwise been able to have.’

The differences in language have also been somewhat of a change from the US.

‘I think our favourite word is rubbish,’ Emma Mary, a four-year DCC member who enjoys National Public Radio and iBooks, said. ‘We can’t stop talking about the rubbish. We haven’t been here long enough to start saying “loo,” but if we were here a few more days I could totally see some of us picking up on that.’

The difference between chips, French fries, crisps and potato chips is still a bit confusing.

‘We went to a fish and chips place around the corner and then they had actual potato chips on the table for us,’ Nicole Bulcher, who holds degrees in history, justice studies and sociology, said. ‘When we told the woman the chips were good, she told us they were crisps. Okay… crisps, chips, French fries, fried potatoes, they’re all good.’

Although they’ve enjoyed eating fish and chips, lamb, toffee pudding and other English dishes, the ladies are calling for ‘some queso’ in London as they’ve been missing one particular taste from home:

‘Mexican food. I was born, bred and raised on Mexican food and I’ve been craving it,’ Miss Kathryne said. ‘It’s only been a few days, but I’m ready for some spicy, southern, Tex-Mex food.’

The comfort food of Dallas may be across the pond, but the members of the cheerleading squad anticipate feeling right at home on Wembley even though the Cowboys will technically be the away team on Sunday.

‘The Cowboys are an international brand,’ Miss Rena said. ‘We saw people wearing Dallas jerseys near Buckingham Palace and I think even though we are the away team, our fans will be loud. We’ll just own it like it’s our home stadium.’

Kathryne added: ‘We could see Broncos jerseys. We could see Redskins jerseys. It will kind of be a melting pot. It’s going to make the atmosphere very exciting because people will be rooting for big plays and whatever else is exciting during the game. The crowd is going to be lively and I’m hoping to see the same intensity that they bring to a soccer match. If they bring that, it’s going to be a loud, energetic and awesome experience.’

Although the Cowboys won’t be returning to Wembley next season, the ladies are hopeful they’ll be back for a future International Series game or if the NFL installs a team in London permanently.

‘I think that would be amazing,’ Miss Bulcher said. ‘Making the NFL a more international interest would make sense. This would be the best away game to go to.’

One thing many people don’t realise when they see the boots, pom-poms and blue and white outfits is how much work cheering for the Dallas Cowboys requires, the DCC members said. Although the ladies all have other jobs, their responsibilities for the team are full-time and there is no offseason.

‘Practises and games are only 50 per cent of the job,’ Miss Kathryne said. ‘We have a lot of appearances, a lot of shows, a lot of radio spots and a lot of TV productions. Every day of the week at least one of us is doing something. It’s a full-time commitment. You’re in uniform a lot more during the week than just at the games.’

‘Who you are really matters,’ Miss Mary added. ‘We truly are America’s sweethearts. We’re representing the Dallas Cowboys wherever we go whether it’s at our job, at our church or in London. We don’t have an offseason. Maybe two weeks in January – unless we get booked. We’re constantly performing, but we love it that way.’

The Cowbys face the Jaguars at Wembley and can count on some familiar support across the pond

Much like in the NFL, tryouts for the team are held each year and it’s not uncommon to see veterans get cut and replaced. The competition is stressful, but it also ensures that the squad is always showcasing the best possible talent on gamedays.

That talent will be on full display at Wembley on Sunday and Jacie Veronica, a Louisiana native who skipped fifth grade and aspires to write for Sports Illustrated, has a message for anyone and everyone who’ll be attending the international event:

‘We’re not just America’s team.’

Executives with dreams of establishing a permanent NFL club at Wembley should hope Londoners feel the same way. The presence of America’s sweethearts in the UK will certainly help the cause.
