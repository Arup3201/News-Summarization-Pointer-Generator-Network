Triathlete Alistair Brownlee

Just two months ago, Olympic athlete Alistair Brownlee was receiving a rapturous applause after he won a gold medal in the triathlon in front of a home crowd.

But the super fit athlete proved he is human after all after he was rushed to hospital in Leeds with stomach cramps. There doctors diagnosed him with appendicitis - an inflammation of the appendix and said they would need to remove it quickly.

Thankfully, the operation passed off without a hitch and Brownlee even posted a graphic surgical picture of his infected body part shortly afterwards.

He asked his 59,000 followers: 'Anyone know what this is? I might put it on ebay!'

The 24-year-old, from Branhope in Leeds, had been on his way to Heathrow to catch a flight to Brazil when he was taken ill.

Luckily
his father Keith, who is a consultant paediatrician, was on hand and 
sent him straight to A&E at the Leeds General Infirmary.

He tweeted: 'Yes it was my appendix. 
Got horribly ill last week, went into hospital with a sore tummy and 
came out 2 days later. Thanks Dad and the NHS!'

He added: 'Was on my way to airport en route to Brazil, trip put back a week and first trip to a Hospital instead.'

An appendicectomy takes around 30minutes to perform and performed under general anaesthetic.

The appendix is now often removed via keyhole surgery as it means a shorter stay in hospital and a quicker recovery. The surgeon makes two or three small cuts of about 1cm each in the lower abdomen and passes special instruments through to remove the organ. The cut is then closed with stitches or glue.

Anyone know what this is? Alistair Brownlee tweeted a picture of his operation to his 59,000 strong-stomached followers

Dr Brownlee told the Yorkshire 
Evening Post: 'The whole family was absolutely delighted at the care and
treatment Alistair received from the doctors, nurses and other staff at
Leeds General Infirmary.'

Dr Brownlee did not perform the appendectomy.

Alistair won his gold medal in front of cheering crowds in London's Hyde Park, providing one of the most memorable images of the games. His brother Jonny took a bronze in the same event.

Alistair is now having to rest-up following his operation and yesterday flew to South America for a three-week holiday starting in Brazil and going on to Peru. He will be forced to watch his brother compete in the Auckland Triathlon on the TV.

He wrote on Twitter: 'Would
have been great to help Jonny out in Auckland but I've been forced into
and am ready for a rest. Holiday time #helloBrazil'

The determined athlete will start training again when he returns.

Alistair is also back-to-back European Triathlon Union champion and a two-time Triathlon World Champion, having won in 2009 and again in 2011.
