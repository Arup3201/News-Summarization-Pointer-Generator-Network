The family of a former public schoolboy killed while fighting for Islamic State have blamed the UK government for making it difficult for young fighters like him to return to Britain.

Muhammad Mehdi Hassan, 20, was said to be desperate to escape the warzone in Syria but was scared of the repercussions awaiting him if he made it back to his home city of Portsmouth.

Last night his devastated family said Hassan, and other fighters like him, would put down their weapons and return to their homes if the threat of being jailed in the UK wasn’t hanging over them.

Scared: Muhammed Mehdi Hassan, 19, had expressed plans to return to Britain over the last few months but had been scared about the repercussions and the threat of prosecution on terror charges, his family said

The aspiring young student’s parents had travelled to Turkey earlier this year to meet him in the hope of bringing him home. But just minutes away from the border, he was stopped from leaving by fellow militants.

His uncle, Muslim Khan, described last night how Hassan’s family discovered that he had died last week fighting in the battle for Kobane after seeing images of his body posted on Twitter. 

Mr Khan told ITV News that Hassan’s fate could have been different if the young fighter, who spoke about being trapped in Syria, thought the UK government would be willing to help people like him return to Britain.

‘If the British Government helped them to come back, I think all of them would come back. I believe that,’ Mr Khan said.

'Lovely': Hassan's family said that his fate would have been different if the Government had made it easier to return home after fighting in Syria

‘They want to come back but they are scared. They [the Government] have said if they come [back] they’ll go to prison.’

He appealed to the parents of a group of more than 30 disenchanted British jihadis who want to escape the fighting not to give up in the hope that the Government could change its policy.

Many are unable to leave the warzone amid threats from senior Islamic State figures that they could be beheaded for disloyalty, and if they do escape they face being jailed in the UK.

Mr Khan said: ‘My message to the parents, don’t give up, we will try and maybe the Government will change their policy and they will come back here. Like Mehdi, he was nearly coming and he could not come. It’s bad luck. Don’t give up. Try.’

Hassan’s mother said she feared her son had been radicalised via friends and the internet while spending hours on his laptop after seeing images of the brutality against democracy protesters in Syria.

In an emotional interview with ITV News she said: ‘I had no idea he was thinking of that [jihad]. It was out of his character he would abandon his family and leave like that. He was loving, gentle and a kind boy. People who met him would remember him for manners and etiquette.’

Hassan, who used the ‘battle name’ Abu Dujana, was among a group of friends who called themselves the Britani Brigade Bangladeshi Bad Boys who travelled to Syria from Portsmouth. He was the fourth of the group to be killed.

His mother described them as normal young people with good educations. She said: ‘Their parents are [as] shocked as I am. Most loved sons – they have beautiful prosperous future ahead of them.

Fanatics: Hassan's uncle said that his nephew and his friends, pictured in Gatwick airport on their way to Turkey, would have all come back home but that they were afraid of going to prison

‘Their hearts melted when they saw what’s happening in Syria. They are impressionable boys and they are so naive they didn’t think in balanced way about implication on life.’ 

She added tearfully: ‘I am trying to carry on for the rest of my children. I miss Muhammad so much. It’s just like a nightmare, this time last year in October we had lots of fun... he was just fine and with us all the time.’

The death of Hassan means four of the six self-styled Portsmouth jihadis are now dead, with another serving a prison sentence in Britain for terrorist offences and one believed to be in hospital. 

Hassan attended St John's College, a Catholic school in Portsmouth, which charges £10,000 a year for pupils

Hassan’s friend Mamunur Mohammed Roshid, 24 – nicknamed Sleepyhead – is thought to have been killed a few days before him last week. Muhammad Hamidur Rahman, 25, a former Primark worker also from Portsmouth, was killed in July by troops loyal to the Assad regime.

A fourth Portsmouth man, Ifthekar Jaman, 23, died in Syria in December last year while taking part in an IS assault on a major arms depot. He had previously worked in customer services for Sky.

The fifth Portsmouth jihadi, Mashudur Rahman Choudhury, 31, was jailed on terrorism charges in May after returning to Britain from Syria in October last year.

A teacher who planned to wage jihad alongside Islamic State was only stopped from flying to Syria when his family confiscated his passport.

Jamshed Javeed, 30, is now facing jail after admitting two counts of engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts at Woolwich Crown Court in south London yesterday.

British-born Javeed, who taught science at Sharples School in Bolton, decided to join the fighting after becoming ‘deeply moved’ by reports of the suffering of Syrians.

However he insisted that he was not an extremist and even intended to resume his teaching career following his return from Syria. His lawyers said he did not support the aims of Islamic State or the execution of hostages.

The father of two, of Levenshulme, Manchester, made plans to leave last November but relatives – including his father – hid his passport. He applied for another one but was arrested last December as he tried to travel to Syria.

He has been remanded in custody for sentencing.

Detectives are confident that he did not radicalise any pupils at his school, and say his arrest came as a ‘complete shock’ to fellow staff.
