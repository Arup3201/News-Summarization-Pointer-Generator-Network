A suicide bomber has killed at least 55 people and wounded more than 120 during a 'flag-lowering' ceremony at the main Pakistan-India border crossing.  

The explosion happened at the Wagah border gate near the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore after the display of military pageantry that attracts thousands of spectators every day.

Crowds gather at Wagah each sunset to watch the ceremony that accompanies the formal closing of the border post.

Pakistan has been wracked by a homegrown Taliban insurgency, the Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP) movement that has killed thousands of people in recent years

The attack is a rare strike in Punjab, Pakistan's richest and most populous province. 

The area, which is also the power-base of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, has been spared the worst of the bloody wave of Islamist violence that has assailed the country in recent years.

Mushtaq Sukhera, the Punjab provincial police chief, said: 'It appears to have been a suicide attack. At least 55 people have been killed and more than 120 wounded. Women and children were also killed.'

Lahore police chief Amin Wains confirmed it was a suicide attack. It appears the blast took place some distance from the famous crossing point itself.

'People were returning after watching the parade at Wagah border when the blast took place. Ball bearings were found at the scene,' he said.

Mushtaq Sukhera, the Punjab police chief, said the blast happened when a suicide attacker approached a restaurant after the Wagah ceremony and detonated his explosives. 

He said the attacker had struck when security had been 'a bit relaxed'.

There are several security checkpoints on the road leading to the border post, which is equipped with a ceremonial gate and banked seating.

Before entering, spectators are security checked, though searches are not always particularly rigorous. 

Dozens of people use the Wagah crossing to enter India and Pakistan every day as it is the only road crossing between the two countries.

It is also a crucial trade facility, where truck-loads of goods coming from and going to India are loaded and unloaded.

Tahir Javed, a senior security official in Punjab province said that the dead included three members of the border force. 

He said: 'The suicide bomber failed to cross the security barrier and blew himself up outside when people were coming out.' 

Tonight, Pakistani opposition politician Imran Khan condemned the blast as an 'act of terror'.

'Shocked and saddened by suicide attack near Wagah border,' the former international cricketer tweeted.

Meanwhile Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the attack as a 'dastardly act of terrorism'.

India has in the past accused Pakistan of sponsoring jihadi groups in the region.

The two countries, which have fought three wars against each other, have been engaged in a long-running conflict over the region of Kashmir, which both sides claim.

An Indian security official said the Indian side of the border was not affected by the explosion.

In recent weeks, the homegrown Pakistani Taliban group has become fragmented and the differing factions have all laid claim to the suicide bomb attack which has killed at least 55 people 

Pakistan has been wracked by a homegrown Taliban insurgency, the Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP) movement that has killed thousands of people in recent years. 

In recent weeks the movement has become fragmented, which has meant several conflicting claims of responsibility for the attack.

Abdullah Bahar, a spokesman for a TTP faction loyal to its dead chief Hakimullah Mehsud, said they carried it out to avenge Mehsud's killing in a US drone strike last year.

But the Jamat-ul-Ahrar faction, which broke away from the main TTP leadership in September, rubbished the claim and said they were behind the blast.

Group spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan said in an email statement the attack was revenge for those killed in the ongoing military operation in North Waziristan tribal area, on the Afghan border. Ehsan said they would soon release video footage of the attack.

TV channels also ran claims from a third militant faction, called Jundullah.

Attacks by the homegrown Taliban insurgency were once a near-daily occurrence but have tailed off since the army launched its anti-militant offensive in the north-west.

In June the army began the long-awaited operation against militant hideouts in North Waziristan after a bloody raid on Karachi Airport ended faltering peace talks between the government and the Taliban.

More than 1,100 militants and 100 soldiers have been killed since the start of the operation, and more than 100 militants have surrendered, according to the military.
