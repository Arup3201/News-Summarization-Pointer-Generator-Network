The wife of a convicted drugs baron spent  thousands of pounds on Botox, designer handbags and sports cars while claiming benefits, a court heard.

Diane Brookhouse, 41, applied for the state handouts after her husband Richard, 45, was jailed for smuggling cocaine and heroin.

But rather than living on the breadline, the mother of two enjoyed a lavish lifestyle by  helping him run his illegal  business from behind bars, it is alleged.

Trial: Diane Brookhouse (left) collected her husband Richard (right) - who masterminded the operation from his prison cell - on day release from Kirkham open prison and drove him to drugs meetings, the court heard

Warrington Crown Court was told that 
Brookhouse was a key player in a drugs ring that imported more than 
£15million of heroin and cocaine into the UK via ‘fishing trips’ from 
France.

Neil Flewitt QC, prosecuting, claimed 
she took her husband, who was nearing the end of his 22-year sentence, 
to meetings with drug dealing associates while on day release from 
prison. He said: ‘She did so, in part at least, in order to obtain the 
funds required to maintain a lifestyle that she could not afford to 
enjoy through legitimate means.’

Brookhouse also claimed  benefits, he 
said, while making a ‘substantial cash deposit’ on her rented property 
as well as rental payments that ‘exceeded the amount that she received 
by way of housing benefit’.

She also ran two luxury cars – a Mercedes CLC 180 Sport and a Volkswagen Golf convertible.

Mr Flewitt told jurors that 
Brookhouse, of Warrington, Cheshire, spent almost £1,300 at the 
hairdressers’, making 16  visits to a Toni and Guy salon in just over a 
year.

Fists up: Former amateur boxing champion Carl Wall, 36, was described as a 'wholesaler' for whom Mr Brookhouse arranged importations. He admitted conspiracy to supply controlled drugs

And between June 2010 and June 2013, 
she also allegedly spent £2,635 on Botox and filler treatments at a  
private clinic, which she mostly paid for in cash, and had two 
top-of-the range iPhones on £80 contracts.

When Brookhouse was arrested, police 
also found a £1,215 receipt for a handbag by the designer brand Chloe 
and £440 cash in her purse.

The brunette is in the dock alongside 
co-accused Stephen Crane, 55, of Lutterworth, Leicestershire, and Ikhlaq
Hussain, 25, of Bury. All three deny conspiracy to supply cocaine and 
heroin. Brookhouse also denies conspiracy to supply the party drug 
mephedrone or M-cat. The court heard that the drugs were trafficked into
Britain by a 19-strong gang using chartered fishing breaks to the 
continent as cover.

The plot unravelled after a trip to 
northern France in April last year when officers in Essex collared two 
men loading a van with a haul including cocaine with a street value of 
£15million and £400,000 worth of heroin.

The other 16 gang members have admitted various charges of conspiracy to supply drugs.

Richard Brookhouse, who ran the 
operation from his prison cell via smuggled mobile phones, has admitted 
the same charge and will be sentenced later.

The trial continues.
