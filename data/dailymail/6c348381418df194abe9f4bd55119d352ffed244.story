Britons should celebrate the next increase in interest rates, according to Bank of England deputy governor Charlie Bean

Britons should celebrate the next increase in interest rates, according to Bank of England deputy governor Charlie Bean.

He said that such a move would signal that the economy is heading towards recovery.

However he admitted the prospect was very low for the next few years and, when it does happen, the Bank would keep the base rate ‘materially below its pre-crisis average of five per cent for some while’, probably rising only to around two to three per cent.

It has been five years since the central bank halved the base rate to 0.5 per cent, the lowest level in its 320-year history in a huge boost for homeowners with a mortgage.

Speaking in Darlington yesterday, Mr Bean said: ‘When the time does come for us to start raising bank rate, we should celebrate that as a welcome sign that the economy is finally well on the road back to normality.’

His comments echo similar ones made by the Chancellor recently who said the first increase in interest rates should be heralded as ‘a mark of success’.

But homeowners, who are struggling to afford their mortgage even at today’s rock-bottom rates of interest, may struggle to agree that a rate rise will provide a reason to celebrate.

There are particular worries about around one million first-time buyers who have bought over the last five years and have never experienced an increase rate rise.

A recent report, based on research by the Centre for Economics and Business Research, predicts the base rate will rise three times to 1.25 per cent by December 2015.

For a family with the average monthly mortgage bill of £666, this would trigger a £21 a month rise to £687 a month, equal to an extra £252 a year increase in their mortgage.

Mr Bean said the first increase could take place in the spring, but urged people not to get ‘too hung up about the precise date’.

In the Bank¿s latest inflation report, it said the market expects the Bank to keep the base rate 'in the range of two to three per cent for some while beyond the forecast horizon'

More importantly, he said the increases will be done ‘only gradually’ and that there is absolutely no chance of rates returning to their pre-crisis average of five per cent imminently.

Mr Bean, 60, who retires in June, said: ‘What, I think, is more useful for businesses to hang on to is our expectation that when bank rate does rise, it will probably do so only gradually.

‘[It will rise] to a level that is likely to remain materially below its pre-crisis average of five per cent for some while.

‘I have something like a two to three per cent range in mind here.’ It is widely expected that the base rate will remain around this level of two to three per cent until 2020.

By comparison, it was typically five per cent during the ten years leading up to the beginning of the financial crisis in 2007.

In the Bank’s latest inflation report, it said the market expects the Bank to keep the base rate ‘in the range of two to three per cent for some while beyond the forecast horizon.’

The so-called forecast horizon ends in 2017, and ‘for some while beyond’ is taken to mean another two to three years after this date.
