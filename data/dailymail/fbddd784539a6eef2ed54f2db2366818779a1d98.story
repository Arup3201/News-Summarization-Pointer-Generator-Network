For most mothers, the school run is an unglamorous affair. Wet hair, tracksuit bottoms and chipped manicures become de rigueur as they rush to drag the children out of 
bed, make their packed lunches and cajole them into the car.

But for a certain breed of mothers, the school run is a whole different ball game.

Writing an anonymous piece in Times2 today, one mother has lifted the lid on what life is really like at the celebrity school gate.

Queens of the school gates: An anonymous mother has lifted the lid on what exactly life is like at the school gates of London's most exclusive schools, where Victoria Beckham and Elle Macpherson turn the school run into a catwalk

Known as 'The Strip', the haunt in West London is home to two of the capital's most exclusive and expensive private schools and the likes of the Beckhams, Elle Macpherson, Claudia Schiffer and Trinny Woodall have frequented the school gate.

'Welcome to the high-octane, caffeine-fuelled, fashion savvy domain. Here, morning drop-off is no ordinary jam-smeared, bleary-eyed routine.

'In fact, celeb-spotting aficionados would be far better placed to set up camp here than at the Beverley Hills Hotel during award season,' writes the mother, whose children share lessons with the celeb offspring.

The writer describes her first day at the celebrity school gate, which she describes as a 'parallel universe', where appearances count for everything.

'With their glossy manes, expensive highlights and Pilates-honed thighs, this was a new breed of woman - an uberbeing, perpetually ready for her close-up,' she said.

She explains how each 'tribe' of stylish mothers define themselves by their choice of handbag.

Picture perfect: 'With their glossy manes, expensive highlights and Pilates-honed thighs, this was a new breed of woman- an uberbeing', says the writer of the mothers at Trinny Woodall and Claudia Schiffer's children's schools

Hermes Birkins are the choice of arm candy by the 'cougar' mothers, who desperately try to emulate Elle Macpherson, whilst the 'fashion mums' rock none other than a Victoria Beckham tote and Claudia Schiffer's minions, known as the 'boho mums', love their Jerome Dreyfuss bags.

No handbag, however, is the biggest statement of power and wealth a mother can make.

These mothers are the ones who are chauffeured to school in a black-out Mercedes, meaning their driver is on hand to guard their Chanel tote whilst they accompany their children to the school gate, the anonymous mother writes.

Fitness fanatics: Gym gear is obligatory at the school gate, as mothers dash off to their Ten Pilates class or Barrecore Ballet

Whilst leather leggings a la Elle Macpherson were once the school gate outfit of choice, this has recently been replaced by super stylish gym gear.

The current trend, she explains, is to match their trainers to the neon stripe in their gym leggings before dashing off to their Ten Pilates or Barrecore Ballet class.

Then there are the super skinny mothers who don't need to exercise at all because they don't bother eating.

'They decamp to a cafe near the school for a daily debrief. Whilst sipping their double-shot soya lattes and inhaling Malboro Lights, they will dispense their verdicts - picture Joan Rivers on steroids,' she writes.

Judging by the latest research, looking good on the school run isn't just a preoccupation of the the rich and famous.

A study by Google found that 'what mums should wear back to school' searches have increased by 40 per cent this year.

Another survey found that mothers spend an average of Â£87 to look good on the school run with the average mother spending up to 25 minutes perfecting her 
hair and make-up and deciding what to wear in preparation for the 
big day.

Amazingly, that's around seven minutes longer than it will take them to get the children ready.
